The overall maternal mortality rate was 11.39 per 100,000 maternities. Direct deaths decreased from 6.24 per 100,000 maternities in 2003-2005to 4.67 per 100,000 maternities in 2006-2008 (p = 0.02). This decline is predominantly due to the reduction in deaths fromthromboembolism and, to a lesser extent, haemorrhage. For the rst time there has been a reduction in the inequalitiesgap, with a signicant decrease in maternal mortality rates among those living in the most deprived areas and those in thelowest socio-economic group. Despite a decline in the overall UK maternal mortality rate, there has been an increase indeaths related to genital tract sepsis, particularly from community acquired Group A streptococcal disease. The mortalityrate related to sepsis increased from 0.85 deaths per 100,000 maternities in 2003-2005 to 1.13 deaths in 2006-2008, and sepsis is now the most common cause of Direct maternal death. Cardiac disease is the most common cause of Indirect death; the Indirect maternal mortality rate has not changed signicantly since 2003-2005. This Condential Enquiry identi-ed substandard care in 70% of Direct deaths and 55% of Indirect deaths. Many of the identied avoidable factors remainthe same as those identied in previous Enquiries. Recommendations for improving care have been developed and arehighlighted in this report. Implementing the Top ten recommendations should be prioritised in order to ensure the overallUK maternal mortality rate continues to decline. Our aim is to improve the health of mothers, babies and children by carrying out condential enquires and related work on a nationwide basis and by widely disseminating our ndings and recommendations.

The short and long-term impact of such a tragedy on her survivingchildren, partner, wider family, the community and thehealth workers who cared for her cannot be overestimated.Yet despite considerable advances in maternity care, andworld-class care provided by highly trained and motivatedprofessionals, good maternal health is still not a universalright, even in countries such as ours which have high-qual- ity maternity services and very low maternal mortality and morbidity rates. This is one the most important reports published dur- ing the unbroken, nearly 60-year history of the Conden- tial Enquiries into Maternal Deaths . It shows for the rst time in many years, a small but very welcome decline inthe overall maternal mortality as well as larger reductionsin deaths from some clinical causes. It is difcult to ignore the apparent relationship between the signicant decline in deaths from pulmonary embolism, and to a les-ser degree from other causes except from sepsis, and thepublication and implementation of clinical guidelineswhich have been recommended in previous Enquiryreports. Perhaps more welcome, in terms of the overall public health, are the rst signs of a narrowing in the long-stand- ing gap relating to pregnancy outcomes between the more comfortable and most deprived women in our population.This includes a signicant reduction in the death rateamong Black African mothers. These improvements dem-onstrate how our maternity services have changed to reachout and care for a group of vulnerable mothers, many ofwhom have sought refuge within our shores and who oftenpresent with medical and social challenges. The decline in the maternal mortality rate is all the more impressive for having taken place against a background ofan increasing birth rate, which has sometimes stretched thematernity services, and a generally older and less healthypopulation of mothers. Moreover, the numbers of births towomen born outside the UK have risen, and these mothersoften have more complicated pregnancies, have more seri-ous underlying medical conditions or may be in poorer general health. It is also impressive that this reduction indeaths has occurred at a time when some other developed countries, such as the USA, are experiencing an increase in maternal deaths. These results have been hard won. The enthusiasm and engagement of our maternity staff for embracing the workof this Enquiry, and acting on its ndings and recommen-dations, is second to none. The reduction in deaths hasoccurred at a time of considerable turbulence and reorgani-sation in the way maternity services are provided in someof the constituent countries of the UK. This Enquiry con- tinues to be truly owned by health professionals who tell us that they are proud to work in a healthcare system inwhich they can participate in, and learn from, such honestreviews of the worst possible outcomes. It is their commit-ment that makes this review the envy of maternity workersin other parts of the world, and why the Enquiry will beproud to incorporate Ireland in the next Report for 2009-11. Many other countries, rich and poor, are now starting similar programmes and are benetting from advice, prac- tical help and mentoring by the assessors, particularly theDirector, Professor Gwyneth Lewis OBE, Professor JamesDrife and the Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries(CMACE) team. It is vital that this momentum is not lost and that low mortality rates do not lead to inertia. Experience has taughtus that old messages need repeating, especially as new cad- res of healthcare workers join the service, and there are always new and unexpected challenges. These include therise in deaths from community-acquired Group A strepto-coccal sepsis detailed in this report, which led to an earlierpublic health alert. The emergence of H1N1 virus infectionwill be covered in the next report covering the relevanttime period. In line with new ways of working, new waysof disseminating the results and recommendations need to be found. It is essential to include this report as part of the Continuing Professional Development requirements for allhealth professionals who may care for pregnant women,and we expect the Colleges to develop innovative methodsto enable this to be taken forward. All of those who contributed to the work of this Enquiry, especially its assessors and authors, are to be con-gratulated for developing such a readable and practical book which, in the best traditions of maternity care, has \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 5 a multidisciplinary team of mater- nity professionals. Such partnership is the bedrock ofmaternity service provision. Several long-standing, hard-working and eminent authors are retiring this trienniumand we owe them a huge debt of gratitude for the passion and commitment they have given to the Enquiry over the years. Our grateful thanks go to Dr Griselda Cooper OBE,Professor Michael de Swiet, Professor James Drife, Dr JohnMcClure, Dr Harry Millward-Sadler and Dr Margaret OatesOBE. We commend this report to all health-service commis- sioners and professionals as well as to those with a generalinterest in pregnancy and birth. Learning and acting on the important messages contained within each chapter will lead to continuing improvements in the prevention and man-agement of life-threatening complications of pregnancy. Bydoing so we shall ensure that for every mother, pregnancy,birth and the start of a new life are as healthy and happyas possible.

The overwhelming strength of successive Enquiry Reports has been the impact their ndings have had on maternaland newborn health in the UK and further aeld. Over theyears there have been many impressive examples of howthe implementation of their recommendations and guide- lines have improved policies, procedures and practice and saved the lives of more mothers and babies. The encourag-ing results given in this Report, in particular the reductionin deaths from Direct causes, especially thromboembolism, as well as among some minority ethnic groups, suggest thatprevious recommendations have had a positive effect.Another example is the increasing number of women'booking' for maternity care by 12 completed weeks of ges- tation, a key recommendation in earlier Reports and which was chosen to be a cornerstone of maternity-care provisionin England. However, in other areas, improvements remainto be seen, and therefore some recommendations from thelast Report are repeated here. Arriving at the 'Top ten' Over time, as the evidence base for clinical interventionshas grown, and with the expansion of the Enquiry intoother professional areas and the wider social and public-health determinants of maternal health, the number of rec-ommendations made in this Report has increased.Although these recommendations are important, theincreasing numbers make it difcult for commissioners andservice providers, in particular at hospital or Trust level, to identify those areas that require action as a top priority. Therefore, to ensure that the key overarching issues are notlost, this Report, as with the last Report for 2003-05, con-tains a list of the 'Top ten' recommendations which allcommissioners, providers, policy-makers, clinicians andother stakeholders involved in providing maternity servicesshould plan to introduce, and audit, as soon as possible.By their overarching or cross-cutting nature, most of these recommendations are broad based and will require a multi- disciplinary approach rather than having relevance for thespecic clinical practice of individual healthcare workers.On an individual and team basis, therefore, all healthcareprofessionals and teams providing maternity care should also read the individual clinical recommendations relatingto specic clinical causes of death or their individual speci-ality as well as these overarching ones. These overarching recommendations were drawn up fol- lowing detailed discussions between all of the assessors involved in this Report. In some cases, they considered thatinsufcient progress has been made since the last Report andthat a similar recommendation needs to be repeated here. This list adds to, but does not replace, key recommenda- tions made in earlier Reports. Baseline data and audit of progress All changes and interventions need to be monitored andthe outcome or impact must be audited to ensure that theyare resulting in benecial changes to the quality of care orservices provided to pregnant or recently delivered women.If not then remediable action to improve the outcomes canbe taken. It is recognised that the data needed to auditthese recommendations may not be currently available or collected routinely in all units, but it could form part of a future local audit or dataset. National data sets are cur-rently being developed and it may be possible to incorpo-rate these in future Reports. Learning from specic individual Chapter recommendations Whereas the 'Top ten' recommendations are mainly of gen- eral importance, the individual Chapters in this Reportcontain more targeted recommendations for the identica-tion and management of particular conditions for specicservices or professional groups. These are no less importantand should be addressed by any relevant national bodies aswell as by local service commissioners, providers and indi-vidual healthcare staff. Top ten recommendations These are not in any order of priority.'Top ten' recommendations \u00aa2011 Centre for 1-203 7Service provision Recommendation 1: counselling 1.1 Women of childbearing age with pre-existing medi- cal illness, including psychiatric conditions, whose con-ditions may require a change of medication, worsen orotherwise impact on a pregnancy, should be informedof this at every opportunity. This is particularly impor-tant since 50% of pregnancies are not planned. Theyshould be pro-actively offered advice about planning for pregnancy and the need to seek pre-pregnancy counsel- ling whenever possible. Prior to pregnancy, thesewomen should be offered specic counselling and havea prospective plan for the management of their preg-nancy developed by clinicians with knowledge of howtheir condition and pregnancy interact. 1.2 Pre-pregnancy counselling services, starting for women with pre-existing medical illnesses, but ideallyfor all women planning a pregnancy, are a key part ofmaternity services and should be routinely commis-sioned as an integral part of the local maternity services network. They could be provided by the GP practice, specialist midwives or other specialist clinicians orobstetricians, all of whom should be suitably trainedand informed. General practitioners should refer allrelevant women to the local services if they do not pro-vide such counselling themselves. Rationale As in previous Reports, the ndings of this trienniumshow that many of the women who died from pre-exist-ing diseases or conditions that may seriously affect theoutcome of their pregnancies, or that may require differ-ent management or specialised services during pregnancy,did not receive any pre-pregnancy counselling or advice. As a result, their care was less than optimal because nei- ther they nor their carers realised that closer surveillanceor changes to medications were appropriate. Furthermore,unless women receive specic counselling that their drugsare safe in pregnancy, some will stop taking essentialtherapy because of their concerns about the risk to thefetus. The more common conditions that require pre-preg- nancy counselling and advice include: epilepsy diabetes asthma congenital or known acquired cardiac disease autoimmune disordersrenal or liver disease obesity: a body mass index of 30 or more severe pre-existing or past mental illness HIV infection. Baselines and auditable standards Maternity service commissioners and maternity services: Number and percentage of pregnant women with pre-existing medical conditions for whom specialist pre-conception counselling is offered at December 2011and then by the end of 2013. A national maternityrecord may enable such information to be included andeasier to identify. Recommendation 2: Professional interpretation services Professional interpretation services should be provided for all pregnant women who do not speak English.These women require access to independent interpreta- tion services, as they continue to be ill-served by the use of close family members or members of their ownlocal community as interpreters. The presence of rela-tives, or others with whom they interact socially, inhi-bits the free two-way passage of crucial but sensitiveinformation, particularly about their past medical orreproductive health history, intimate concerns anddomestic abuse. Rationale Although it is known that where there is a concentration ofwomen from the same minority ethnic group their infor-mation network concerning maternity care can be good,this does not obviate the need for professional interpreting services. A lack of availability of suitable interpreters is one of the key ndings running throughout this Report. Theuse of family members, in some cases very young school-age children of both sexes, or members of their own, usu-ally tight-knit, community as translators causes concernbecause: The woman may be too shy to seek help for intimateconcerns. It is not appropriate for a child to translate intimatedetails about his or her mother and unfair on both thewoman and child. It is not clear how much correct information is con-veyed to the woman, as the person who is interpretingmay not have a good grasp of the language, does notunderstand the specic medical terminology or maywithhold information. Some women arrive in the UK late in their pregnancy,and the absence of an interpreter means that a compre-hensive booking history cannot be obtained.'Top ten' recommendations 8 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203In some cases, the translator is a perpetrator of domes- tic abuse against his partner, so the woman is unable toask for advice or help. Healthcare staff are unable to pass back their own clini-cal concerns in an appropriate manner. As a woman said in a recent Department of Health Task Force Report against domestic and sexual abuse 1'even if the perpetrator isn't with you, he sends one of his familymembers with you. And in the name of honour you can'tever talk about it. Especially if they say ''I'm going to inter-pret because she can't speak English ''.' Apart from the unsuitability of using family or commu- nity members to undertake this role, those used in this manner appeared to have had little knowledge of English themselves. Commissioners and providers of maternityservices should therefore ensure that professional andindependent interpretation services are available in bothprimary-care and secondary-care settings, to ensure that allwomen can be condent that they can speak freely and incondence to their maternity-care providers. Telephone-based services have proved very useful in similar situa- tions. Baselines and auditable standardsMaternity service commissioners and maternity services: The availability of a local service guideline on care forwomen who do not speak English, including interpreta-tion services. As part of a local maternity services needs assess-ment, a local audit of the numbers and percentages of pregnant women who require and are using pro- fessional interpretation services per visit. Baselinemeasurements by December 2011 and then by theend of 2013. Recommendation 3: Communications and referrals 3.1. Referrals to specialist services in pregnancy should be prioritised as urgent. In some specialties, routinereferrals can take weeks or months, or even be rejectedbecause of local commissioning rules. This is unaccep-table for pregnant women. The referral must clearlystate that the woman is pregnant, and its progressmust be followed up. Trainee doctors and midwives should have a low threshold for referral ''upwards'' and must receive an immediate response. Referralbetween specialties should be at a senior level. Whenrapid referral is required, the senior doctor should usethe telephone.3.2. Good communication among professionals is essen- tial. This must be recognised by all members of the team looking after a pregnant woman, whether she is''low risk'' or ''high risk''. Her GP must be told that sheis pregnant. If information is required from anothermember of the team, it is not enough to send a routinerequest and hope for a reply. The recipient mustrespond promptly, and if not, the sender must follow itup. With a wide variety of communication methods now available, including e-mail, texting and fax, teams should be reminded that the telephone is not an obso-lete instrument. Rationale There were a number of cases in this Report of women dying before they had seen the specialist to whom they had beenreferred because of medical problems. Some women receivedappointments weeks after the original referral despite clearlybeing very ill, but the progress of the referral was not fol-lowed up. One or two women were also refused specialistservices because of local commissioning arrangements. In many cases of substandard care assessed by this Enquiry, there were major failures of communication between healthcare workers that may have contributed tothe woman's death in some cases. Notably, these includedGPs not being asked for information or not being con-sulted about further referral and, in some cases, the GP notbeing informed that the woman was pregnant. The con-verse was also true, with the GP not passing on informa-tion relevant to the woman's health and wellbeing. It is also evident from some of these cases that junior trainees and midwives in the front line seeing womenattending as emergencies did not have proper support andback up and need to have clear guidelines about when toseek senior help. They should not be expected to managesick women alone, and if they ask for help and review, theyshould be supported. Trainees need to communicate thegravity and urgency of the situation clearly when discussing women with consultants, who should ensure that they have asked enough questions to enable themselves to assess thesituation fully and whether they need to attend in person.They should also adhere to the recent Royal College ofObstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) guideline on theresponsibility of the consultant on call, which gives a clearindication of the duties of a consultant obstetrician andwhen they should attend. 2 Baselines and auditable standardsMaternity service commissioners and maternity services: The number of maternity services with local guidelinesor protocols which have been developed to clarify their'Top ten' recommendations \u00aa2011 Centre for 1-203 This includes the number of services thathave adopted the recent RCOG guideline on theresponsibility of the consultant on call. 2 The waiting times before being seen after a woman has been referred for a specialist opinion and a sys- tem for ensuring that women are seen with sufcienturgency.

Recommendation 4: Women with potentially serious medical conditions require immediate and appropriate multidisciplinaryspecialist care Women with pre-existing disease at the start of preg- nancy: 4.1 Women whose pregnancies are likely to be compli- cated by potentially serious underlying pre-existing medical or mental health conditions should be imme- diately referred to appropriate specialist centres ofexpertise where both care for their medical conditionand their obstetric care can be optimised. Providersand commissioners should consider developing proto-cols to specify which medical conditions mandateat least a consultant review in early pregnancy. Thisagreement should take place via local maternity networks. Pregnant women who develop potential complications: 4.2. Women whose pregnancies become complicated by potentially serious medical or mental health conditionsshould have an immediate referral to the appropriatespecialist centres of expertise as soon as their symptomsdevelop. 4.3. In such urgent cases, referral can take place by telephone contact with the consultant or their secretary(to make sure they are available or identify analternative consultant if not), followed up by a fax if necessary. 4.4. Midwives and GPs should be able to refer women directly to both a obstetrician or a non-obstetric specia- list - but must inform the obstetrician. The midwife should, wherever possible, discuss this with, or alert, thewoman's GP.Rationale Medical care is advancing rapidly, as are changes in the way'routine' maternity care is provided in the UK, and womenmust not be disadvantaged by this. It must be appreciatedthat not all maternity centres are able or equipped to care for pregnant women with major complications either pre- ceding or developing in pregnancy. If women with underly-ing medical conditions are to share in the advances inmedicine, more will require referral to tertiary or specialistmedical centres for their care in pregnancy. This triennium, the assessors have been struck by the lack of appropriate referral of potentially high-risk women, andlack of consultant involvement remains a problem in the care of women with serious medical problems. The reasons for failure to refer are likely to be multiple. It may be that themedical problem is beyond the resources of a secondary refer-ral centre: for example complex liver disease in pregnancy.This may require hepatobiliary surgeons, hepatologists andhaematologists skilled in the management of coagulopathy. It may also be that, although the secondary referral cen- tre has a 'specialist' centre, the clinicians there are insuf- ciently skilled in the management of pregnancy in women with the disease that they specialise in, for example heartdisease. The local clinicians may be excellent at the man-agement of ischaemic heart disease but not in caring forcongenital heart disease or cardiomyopathy. It is also possible that the secondary centre may be too small to develop sufcient expertise in the management ofthe disease in question or to set up the combined medical/ obstetric clinics that have been recommended, for example to care for insulin-dependent diabetes in pregnancy.

Quality of care Recommendation 5: Clinical skills and training 5.1. Back to basics. All clinical staff must undertake reg- ular, written, documented and audited training for theidentication and initial management of serious obste-tric conditions or emerging potential emergencies, suchas sepsis, which need to be distinguished from com-monplace symptoms in pregnancy. 5.2. All clinical staff must also undertake regular, writ- ten, documented and audited training for:'Top ten' recommendations 10 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203The understanding, identication, initial management and referral for serious commoner medical and mental health conditions which, although unrelated to preg-nancy, may affect pregnant women or recently deliveredmothers. These may include the conditions in recom-mendation 1, although the list is not exclusiveThe early recognition and management of severely illpregnant women and impending maternal collapseThe improvement of basic, immediate and advanced life support skills. A number of courses provide additional training for staff caring for pregnant women and new-born babies. Rationale A lack of clinical knowledge and skills among some doc- tors, midwives and other health professionals, senior orjunior, was one of the leading causes of potentially avoid-able mortality this triennium. One of the commonestndings in this Report was the initial failure by manyclinical staff, including GPs, Emergency Department staff,midwives and hospital doctors, to immediately recogniseand act on the signs and symptoms of potentially life- threatening conditions. To help with this, the assessors have developed a short new section, Back to basics , which is included in this Report for the rst time. Although notexhaustive, nor designed to replace more in-depth clinicaltraining, it does contain useful checklists to act as anaide memoire. Its contents may appear simplistic or self-evident to many readers, but it nevertheless reflects thefact that these basic signs and symptoms were too often overlooked and may have contributed to some maternal deaths this triennium. As with the previous Report, even sick women who were admitted to specialist care were still failed by a lack of rec-ognition of the severity of their illness or a failure to referfor another opinion (see also Recommendation 6). There is also a need for staff to recognise their limitations and to know when, how and whom to call for assistance. Baseline and auditable standards The provision of courses and a system for ensuring all staffattend and complete the training as identied in the Clini-cal Negligence Scheme for Trusts (CNST) Training NeedsAnalysis. This is a level 1 requirement for CNST maternityservices in England. The record of attendees should be reg- ularly audited to reinforce, familiarise and update all staff with local procedures, equipment and drugs. Number and percentage of members of all cardiac arrestteams who know where the maternity unit is and whoknow the door codes for gaining immediate access to it.Target 100%.Recommendation 6: Specialist clinical care: identifying and managing verysick women 6.1. There remains an urgent need for the routine use of a national modied early obstetric warning score(MEOWS) chart in all pregnant or postpartum womenwho become unwell and require either obstetric orgynaecology services. This will help in the more timely recognition, treatment and referral of women who have, or are developing, a critical illness during or after preg-nancy. It is equally important that these charts are alsoused for pregnant or postpartum women who areunwell and are being cared for outside obstetric andgynaecology services e.g. Emergency Departments.Abnormal scores should not just be recorded but shouldalso trigger an appropriate response. 6.2. The management of pregnant or postpartum women who present with an acute severe illness, e.g. sepsis withcirculatory failure, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia with severe arterial hypertension and major haemorrhage, requires a team approach. Trainees in obstetrics and/or gynaecol-ogy must request help early from senior medical staff,including advice and help from anaesthetic and criticalcare services. In very acute situations telephoning anexperienced colleague can be very helpful. The recentRCOG guideline of the duties and responsibilities ofconsultant on call should be followed. 6.3 Pregnant or recently delivered women with unex- plained pain severe enough to require opiate analgesiarequire urgent senior assessment/review. Rationale As mentioned in the Back to basics recommendation, a lack of clinical knowledge and skills among some doctors,midwives and other health professionals, senior or junior,was one of the leading causes of potentially avoidable mortality. This was not only the case when distinguishing the signs and symptoms of potentially serious diseasefrom the commonplace symptoms of pregnancy in pri-mary care or the Emergency Department but also once awoman was admitted to hospital. There were a numberof healthcare professionals who either failed to identifythat a woman was becoming seriously ill or who failed tomanage emergency situations outside their immediate area of expertise, and did not call for advice and help. In many cases in this Report, and relevant to the issues identied in the preceding paragraph, the early warningsigns of impending maternal collapse went unrecognised.The early detection of severe illness in mothers remains achallenge to all involved in their care. The relative rarity'Top ten' recommendations \u00aa2011 Centre for BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 11of such events, combined with the normal changes in physiology associated with pregnancy and childbirth,compounds the problem. Modied early warning scoringsystems have been successfully introduced into other areasof clinical practice, and the last Report gave an example of a MEOWS chart. This is available on the CMACE website at www.cmace.org.uk. These charts should beintroduced for all pregnant or postpartum women whobecome unwell and require further treatment, includingfollowing obstetric interventions and gynaecological sur-gery. A small but important point is that a recurrent theme and recommendation throughout successive Reports, which has made no impact, is that women who have unexplained pain severe enough to require opiate analgesia have asevere problem and must be referred for specialist investi-gation and diagnosis. Women with cardiac disease,impending aortic dissection and other causes of death weremissed in this way. CNST and similar schemes in other UK countries may wish to consider whether the use of MEOWS charts should be part of the audit of notes carried out as part of the assessment process. Baseline and auditable standards The number of maternity services who have adopted a ver-sion of any existing MEOWS charts and trained all staff inits use. Baseline measurement by December 2011 and thenby the end of 2013. The number of women in hospital following caesareansection who had regular postoperative observationstaken and recorded on a MEOWS chart and had appro-priate action taken when variances occurred. This couldbe part of the suggested CNST, or similar, audit of notes. Recommendation 7: Systolic hypertension requires treatment 7.1 All pregnant women with pre-eclampsia and a systo- lic blood pressure of 150-160 mmHg or more requireurgent and effective anti-hypertensive treatment in linewith the recent guidelines from the National Institutefor Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)3. Considera-tion should also be given to initiating treatment at lower pressures if the overall clinical picture suggests rapid deterioration and/or where the development ofsevere hypertension can be anticipated. The target systo-lic blood pressure after treatment is 150 mmHg. Rationale It is disappointing that in this triennium, as flagged up in the last, the single most serious failing in the clinical care providedfor mothers with pre-eclampsia was the inadequate treatment of their systolic hypertension. In several women, this resultedin a fatal intracranial haemorrhage. Systolic hypertension wasalso a key factor in most of the deaths from aortic dissection.The last Report suggested that clinical guidelines should iden- tify a systolic pressure above which urgent and effective anti- hypertensive treatment is required. Since then, a recent NICEguideline has identied that threshold as being 150-160 mmHg. 3The guideline also recommends that pregnant women with pre-eclampsia and a systolic blood pressure of150 mmHg or more should be admitted to hospital for urgenttreatment. Clinically, it is also important to recogniseincreases in, as well as the absolute values of, systolic blood pressure. In severe and rapidly worsening pre-eclampsia, early treatment at <150-160 mmHg is advisable if the trend sug-gests that severe hypertension is likely. Auditable standards Specic local projects should be devised to audit manage-ment and treatment of severe pre-eclampsia. For example,one suggestion is to audit the number and proportion of women with very severe pre-eclampsia (a systolic blood pres- sure of 180 mmHg or more on two or more occasions) andthen who had a systolic pressure of 150 mmHg or less within2 hours of starting antihypertensive treatment. Recommendation 8: Genital tract infection/sepsis 8.1 All pregnant and recently delivered women need to be informed of the risks and signs and symptoms of genitaltract infection and how to prevent its transmission.Advice to all women should include verbal and writteninformation about its prevention, signs and symptomsand the need to seek advice early if concerned, as well asthe importance of good personal hygiene. This includes avoiding contamination of the perineum by washing hands before and after using the lavatory or changingsanitary towels. It is especially necessary when the womanor her family or close contacts have a sore throat or upperrespiratory tract infection. 8.2. All health care professionals who care for pregnant and recently delivered women should adhere to localinfection control protocols and be aware of the signs andsymptoms of sepsis in the women they care for and theneed for urgent assessment and treatment. This is parti-cularly the case for community midwives, who may bethe rst to pick up any potentially abnormal signs during their routine postnatal observations for all women, not just those who have had a caesarean section. If puerperalinfection is suspected, the woman must be referred backto the obstetric services as soon as possible.'Top ten' recommendations 12 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-2038.3 High dose intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy should be started as early as possible, as immediate antibiotic treatment may be life saving. Itshould be started within the rst hour of recognition ofseptic shock and severe sepsis without septic shock, aseach hour of delay in achieving administration of effec-tive antibiotics is associated with a measurable increasein mortality 4,5. 8.4 There is an urgent need for a national clinical guide- line to cover the identication and management of sep-sis in pregnancy, labour and the postnatal period andbeyond. This should be available to all health profes- sionals, maternity units, Emergency Departments, GPs and Community Midwives. Until such time as anational guideline is developed, the principles for themanagement of acute sepsis as detailed in Chapter 16:Critical Care of this Report should be adopted. Theseare derived from those developed and updated by theSurviving Sepsis Campaign 4. 8.5 Consideration should be given to adopting a more rational system for classifying maternal deaths fromsepsis, as suggested in Annex 7.1 in this Report. Rationale Unlike many other causes of direct maternal mortality,deaths from genital tract sepsis have risen rather thandeclined this triennium. Indeed, genital tract sepsis hasbecome the leading cause of Direct maternal death in the UK for the rst time since these Condential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths commenced in 1952. This is a real cause for concern, particularly as it has occurred against abackground of an overall decrease in maternal mortality.Many of these deaths were from community-acquiredGroup A streptococcal disease, which mirrors the increasedincidence of Streptococcus A in the general population. Although for some women, despite excellent care, the out-come was unavoidable because of the rapid course and late presentation of their illness, in others, possible opportuni- ties to save lives were missed. The number of maternaldeaths from sepsis should be reduced still further. Streptococcal sore throat is one of the most common bac- terial infections of childhood. All of the mothers who diedfrom Group A streptococcal sepsis either worked with, orhad, young children. Several mothers had a history of recentsore throat or respiratory infection, and some of these women also had family members, especially children, with sore throats, suggesting that spread from family members is afurther risk factor for developing life-threatening sepsis.Therefore, all pregnant or recently delivered women need tobe advised of the signs and symptoms of infection and howto take steps to prevent its transmisson. Women in thesecircumstances should also be encouraged to seek urgent med- ical advice from their GP or maternity services if they feel atall ill. As in previous Reports, delays in recognising sepsis, pre- scribing antibiotics and seeking consultant help were com- mon. Antibiotics were sometimes prescribed in inadequate doses, were given orally rather than intravenously, weregiven too late or were discontinued too soon. Immediateaggressive treatment in the rst 'golden hour' or so offersthe best hope of recovery, as each hour of delay in achiev-ing administration of effective antibiotics is associated witha measurable increase in mortality. 5 Sepsis is complex, incompletely understood, often dif- cult to recognise and manage, and presents a continuing challenge. Some deaths will always be unavoidable, but bet-ter training, a structured approach, good care in the com-munity, and, in hospital, prompt investigation andtreatment, particularly immediate intravenous antibiotictreatment and early involvement of senior obstetricians, an-aesthetists and critical-care consultants, may help in futureto save lives. Auditable standards The percentage of women who had an infection and whohad antibiotic therapy started within an hour of presumeddiagnosis. Target 100% within 1 hour. Until a national guideline is available, all maternity ser-vices should use existing guidelines to develop theirown clinical guideline for the identication and man- agement of pregnancy-related sepsis by the end of December 2011. See Chapter 7. The number and percentage of women who receiveroutine antibiotic prophylaxis in accordance withrecognised RCOG and NICE guidelines for inducedabortion, caesareansection and following obstetric anal sphincter repair.See Chapter 7. The frequency and completeness of routine postnatalchecks in the community compared with NICE Guide-line on Postnatal Care. Clinical governance Recommendation 9: Serious Incident Reporting and Maternal Deaths All maternal deaths must be subject to a high quality local review. In England and Wales the framework forsuch serious incidents (previously known as SeriousUntoward Incidents/SUIs) is set out in the NPSA's''National Framework for Reporting and Learning fromSerious Incidents Requiring Investigation'' issued in'Top ten' recommendations BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 13March 2010. The results of such high quality reviews must be disseminated and discussed with all maternity staff and their recommendations implemented andaudited at regular intervals. Rationale The quality of the serious incident/SUI report forms relating to maternal deaths assessed for this report was highly vari-able, with many of dubious or poor quality. These ndingsmust be taken extremely seriously. For the unacceptablereports, there was little or no evidence of critical thinking oracceptance of shortcomings, little or no self-reflective discus-sion and no evidence that obvious lessons had been identi-ed, let alone learnt. In these cases, little or no action was taken on any results, and, in many cases, staff were not involved in the process or the follow up of any of the lessonslearnt. This was a common nding throughout all the chap-ters in this Report and one which all assessors agree repre-sents unacceptable practice that must be corrected as soon aspossible. The evaluation of such reports is recommended tobe a CNST, or similar, requirement in future. Disappointingly, a similar recommendation was made in the last Report, but little if any improvement has been seen in the cases assessed this triennium; the impression israther the reverse. The recommendation drew attention to the need to highlight who was involved in such reviews\u2014they neededto include clinicians from relevant disciplines (includinganaesthetics) and must include clinicians who were notinvolved with the death. Considering unbiased expert review might assist real learning from individual deaths. Auditable standards Every maternal death should be critically reviewed as a seri-ous incident and the lessons learnt should be actively dis-seminated to all clinical staff, risk managers andadministrators. The precise educational and organisationalactions taken as a result must be recorded, audited and regularly reported to the maternity services board by the Chief Executive Ofcer. Recommendation 10: Pathology The standard of the maternal autopsy must beimproved. The numbers of locations where they are per- formed should reduce, with specialist pathologists taking them on as part of agreed job plans. More clinical dis-cretion over reporting maternal deaths to coroners isrequired, and there should be a complementary majorinput by clinicians into obtaining more consented hos-pital autopsies.Rationale Autopsy diagnoses are fundamental in the categorisation ofmaternal deaths and their subsequent reviews, locally andnationally, but, as evidenced by the ndings in this Report,this was often difcult to achieve. With the changing legis-lation ( Coroner and Justice Act 2009) and the introduction of Medical Examiners to scrutinise all proffered death cer- ticates, there will be a reduction in the number of coroni- al autopsies in England and Wales. Also, when coroners doauthorise maternal death autopsies, there will be no legalbar to transferring the autopsy away to another area wherepathological expertise is recognised. Maternal death autopsies are often complex and chal- lenging and require more expertise than the averageautopsy. They should also be performed according to an all-embracing protocol, such as that adapted from the Royal College of Pathologists recent guidance, which isannexed to Chapter 17. 6 Baseline and auditable standards A review of the quality of maternal autopsies performedand their proportion of all maternal deaths. Baseline mea-surement by December 2011 and then by end of 2013. The proportion of maternal death autopsies that areconsented versus coronial. National guidelines and research As discussed above, national guidelines are urgentlyrequired for The identication and management of sepsis in preg- nant and recently delivered women. How to undertake and act on the results of serious incident reviews in maternity services. Some key research questions also emerged during theassessment of the women who died this triennium. What effect, if any, is the reduced number of routine postnatal visits and clinical observations having on mater-nal health? What are the social, service and clinical factors that con- tribute to maternal mortality rates remaining higher inmothers from certain minority ethnic groups in the UK? What are the barriers that hinder prompt and rapid communications, referrals and urgent appointmentsbetween health providers and maternity or specialist unitsor health professionals that are required for sick pregnantwomen or recently delivered mothers, and how can these be overcome? How can maternity services, especially those providing new models of care, ensure that working systemsfor immediate referral are in place and implemented? To better determine how to reduce the number of Indi- rect causes of maternal deaths, how can the better denom- inator data required to undertake the necessary studies'Top ten' recommendations 14 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203regarding the incidence of medical problems in preg- nancy, such as sepsis, asthma, epilepsy and stroke, beobtained or collected? Why has the incidence of sepsis and Sudden Unex- pected Adult/Arrhythmic deaths (SADS) in pregnancy increased? Is it the result of chance, improved case ascer- tainment or a real increase?

Introduction Several common themes that need to be recognised by all professionals providing maternity care have emerged fromall the Chapters of this Report. To aid learning and clinicalpractice, some key overall good practice points have beenbrought together in this new section of the Report. The les-sons fall into the following main categories: improving basic medical and midwifery practice, suchas taking a history, undertaking basic observations andunderstanding normality attributing signs and symptoms of emerging seriousillness to commonplace symptoms in pregnancy improving communication and referrals. This aide memoire does not cover every eventuality and should be taken as a signpost to help identify and exclude the commoner disorders of pregnancy. It is not, however, exclusive, nor does it replace the need for all health profes-sionals to be up to date with their clinical practice and followthe relevant clinical guidelines. An in-depth discussion of allof these issues as they relate to specic causes of death can befound in the individual chapters of Report, which should beread in conjunction with this aide memoire. Common symptoms Pyrexia Although still very uncommon, deaths from sepsis, especiallycommunity-acquired streptococcal Group A, have increasedover the last 10 years. In part, this mirrors the increased inci-dence of strep A in the general population, but, whereassome maternal deaths from sepsis are unavoidable, others could still be avoided by earlier identication and treatment. Becoming life-threateningly ill from sepsis, and streptococcalsepsis in particular, shows the speed with which women canbecome sick in pregnancy, sometimes dying within 12- 24 hours of rst developing symptoms. A raised temperature during pregnancy, labour or the puerperium is usually caused by common minor ailmentssuch as a cold, 'flu' or other viral illness. But these arediagnoses by exclusion. Pyrexia can be a sign of more seri-ous infection, including puerperal sepsis, chorioamnionitisor other genital tract sepsis, wound or breast infection, pyelonephritis or pneumonia, which may lead to systemic sepsis causing signicant maternal morbidity and maternaland fetal mortality. In some of the women with sepsisdescribed in this Report, earlier recognition of the severityof the illness and recording of temperature and other vitalsigns or earlier action on abnormal results might haveallowed earlier treatment and possibly a better outcome. Sore throat Sore throat is a very common symptom in primary care. Itcan sometimes be caused by Group A streptococcal infec-tion. A throat swab should be taken when a pregnant orrecently delivered woman presents with a sore throat, andthere should be a lower threshold for antibiotic treatmentin primary care. The Centor Criteria 1are shown in the box below: Antibiotic prescribing for sore throats If three of the following criteria are positive, then anti- biotics are indicated1: history of fever tonsillar exudate no cough tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy.Oates et al. 16 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203Some of the women who died had family members, espe- cially children, with sore throats, suggesting that spreadfrom family members may be a further risk factor fordeveloping life-threatening sepsis. Therefore, all pregnant orrecently delivered women need to be advised of the risks and signs and symptoms of infection and how to take steps to prevent its transmisson. This includes the benets ofgood hygiene, such as avoiding contamination of the peri-neum by the mother washing her own hands before, as wellas after, touching her perineum, especially when the womanor her close family have a sore throat or upper respiratorytract infection. Women in these circumstances should alsobe encouraged to seek medical advice if they feel at all ill. Pyrexia in the postnatal period Postnatal observations and examinations are no longer asroutinely carried out in the community as in the past. It istherefore very important that any symptoms, even if appar-ently trivial, are noted and that appropriate clinical obser-vations and examinations are performed to exclude ordetect developing infection as early as possible. Back to basics: sepsis Associated 'red flag' signs and symptoms that shouldprompt urgent referral for hospital assessment, and, if thewomen appears seriously unwell, by emergency ambulance: pyrexia > 38 /C176C sustained tachycardia > 100 bpm breathlessness (RR > 20; a serious symptom) abdominal or chest pain diarrhoea and/or vomiting reduced or absent fetal movements, or absent fetal heart spontaneous rupture of membranes or signicant vaginal discharge uterine or renal angle pain and tenderness the woman is generally unwell or seems undulyanxious, distressed or panicky. A normal temperature does not exclude sepsis. Paraceta-mol and other analgesics may mask pyrexia, and thisshould be taken into account when assessing womenwho are unwell.Infection must also be suspected and actively ruled outwhen a recently delivered woman has persistent vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. If there is any concern, the woman must be referred back to the maternity unitas soon as possible, certainly within 24 hours. Pain All complaints of pain are potentially serious and must be investigated thoroughly. However, the assessors have been particularly concerned about neglected perineal and breastpain in the puerperium. If a woman complains of perineal pain after delivery, her perineum should be examined. If itis known that there has been signicant perineal trauma,for example multiple vaginal lacerations or third-degreetears, then the perineum should be inspected daily until satisfactory healing has taken place. Women complaining of breast pain should also be exam- ined. Mothers with mastitis that does not respond to con-servative measures or that becomes more severe within 12-24 hours of onset should also be referred immediately for amedical opinion. Breast abscesses are not obviously fluctu-ant, and a surgical opinion may also be needed. Abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting Abdominal pain and diarrhoea and vomiting (D&V) maybe common symptoms in primary care, but these symp-toms can also be suggestive of a variety of signicant dis-ease processes during pregnancy and the puerperium. Pregnancy-related causes of abdominal pain or diarrhoea andvomiting In early pregnancy (or before pregnancy is diag- nosed) Rule out an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy can occur in the absence of vaginal bleeding. Fainting anddizziness would usually not occur with gastroenteritis unless there is signicant hypovolaemia caused by dehy- dration, but may occur with a bleeding ectopic preg-nancy. All women of child-bearing age with abdominalpain presenting to the Emergency Department shouldhave a pregnancy test performed. Later in pregnancy or after delivery or end of pregnancy Rule out: pre-eclampsia, eclampsia and HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count) syn-drome, especially if the pain is epigastric or accom-panied by jaundice placental abruption sepsis This can be done by careful physical examination, tem- perature, pulse and respiration and checking all of the following: blood pressure, urine for protein, white cellcount, C-reactive protein, platelets, urea and electrolytesand liver function tests. If any of these are abnormal,then the mother must be referred to the maternity unitas soon as possible. In women who are ill, this referralshould be made before the results of laboratory investi-gations are available.Back to basics \u00aa2011 Centre for BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 17Breathlessness Breathlessness after delivery is very uncommon and needs a full investigation to rule out serious underlying disease.Although it is commoner in pregnancy, largely as the resultof physiological changes, it can also be the presentingsymptom of serious medical conditions, including cardiac disease and other causes of pulmonary oedema, pulmonary embolism and pneumonia. Anaemia has to be cause breathlessness. Back to basics: breathlessness2 Physiological breathlessness of pregnancy This is experienced by up to 75% of pregnant women.It can start in any trimester, and the onset is gradual. Itis often noticed by the woman when she is talking or atrest, although it may get worse with exercise. Asthma It is unusual for asthma to present for the rst time inpregnancy. Most women will have had the diagnosis established before pregnancy. The breathlessness in asthma is often associated with coughing, exhibits diur-nal variation and may get worse with intercurrent respi-ratory infections, hay fever and acid reflux. It improveswith bronchodilators.Never assume that wheeze on auscultation representsasthma, especially in a woman not known to haveasthma; it could be pulmonary oedema. 'Red flag' features suggesting more sinister underlying pathology include: breathlessness of sudden onset breathlessness associated with chest pain orthopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. Diagnoses to consider Pulmonary embolus Sudden onset breathlessness, may have associated pleu-ritic pain, haemoptysis, dizziness. Pneumonia May have associated cough, fever, raised inflammatorymarkers. It is important to remember that pregnantwomen are particularly susceptible to viral (influenza H1N1, varicella zoster) oedemamay be due to:fluid overload, especially in the context of pre- eclampsia mitral stenosis left ventricular failure. Pulmonary hypertension Breathlessness may be the only symptom and is worse on exercise.Investigations that should be considered are chest X-ray, echocardiography and measurement of oxygen saturations at rest and on exercise (in normal women,the oxygen saturation ranges from 96 to 100% anddoes not fall below 95% on exercise). There should bea low threshold for referral of women with breathless-ness in pregnancy from primary to secondary care,particularly if they have any of the 'red flag' featuresnoted above. Headache This is common in pregnancy, but it can be a symptom ofserious underlying illness and should be taken seriously. Back to basics: headache2 The commonest causes of headache in pregnancy are: tension headache\u2014usually bilateral migraine\u2014usually unilateral, may be preceded byaura (often visual), associated with nausea, vomit- ing and photophobia; may be new onset in preg- nancy drug-related\u2014most commonly caused by vasodila-tors and in particular nifedipine. 'Red flag' features suggesting more sinister pathologyinclude: headache of sudden onset headache associated with neck stiffness headache described by the woman as the worstheadache she has ever had headache with any abnormal signs on neurologicalexamination. Diagnoses to consider Subarachnoid haemorrhage Sudden, severe, often occipital so-called 'thunderclap' headache. Cerebral venous thrombosis Unusually severe headache which may be associated with focal signs.Oates et al. 18 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203Pre-eclamptic toxaemia/Impending eclampsia May be associated with seeing flashing lights and is usu- ally associated with other clinical features of severe pre-eclampsia, such as epigastric pain, hypertension, albu-minuria and abnormal bloods.Headache that is 'the worst that the woman has everexperienced' is an indication for urgent brain imagingin the absence of any other features because of concernabout cerebral venous thrombosis. However, less severe headaches can be so non-specic that clinical judgement should be the main guide to further referral to the neu-rological services and investigation. The index of suspi-cion should be high in pregnant women, and all seriouscauses should be considered before dismissing headacheas benign. Anxiety and distress in pregnancy and following delivery The 'Blues' is a period, lasting a few days, of tearfulness and a feeling of being overwhelmed. It occurs in themajority of mothers in the rst 2 weeks following delivery. Episodes of tearfulness, worry, anxiety and depressive symptoms are commonplace in pregnancy and the rst fewweeks after delivery, particularly in rst-time mothers.Mostly these will be mild and self-limiting. However, in some women these symptoms can be the early signs of a more serious illness. Back to basics: good mental health practice Review the woman in 2 weeks. Consider referral to psychiatric services if symptoms persist. Refer urgently to psychiatric services in following cir-cumstances: osuicidal ideation ouncharacteristic symptoms/marked change fromnormal functioning omental in late pregnancy and the rst6 weeks postpartum oassociation with panic attacks and/or intrusiveobsessional thoughts omorbid fears that are difcult to reassure oprofound low mood/ideas of guilt and worthless-ness/insomnia and weight loss opersonal or family history of serious affectivedisorder.Unexplained physical symptoms In a number of maternal deaths, symptoms of the underly-ing physical condition were attributed to psychiatric disor-der. In many women, this was because of non-specicsymptoms such as distress, agitation and loss of appetite.In others, the symptoms of an acute confusional statecaused by the underlying physical condition were misinter- preted as functional mental illness. Clinicians should be aware of the clinical features and causes of confusional states. It should be remembered thatphysical illness can present as psychiatric disorder and canco-exist with it. Unexplained physical symptoms Unexplained physical symptoms should not be attrib-uted to psychiatric disorder: unless there is a clear pathway to symptom produc-tion unless there is a known previous psychiatric history when they represent a marked change from normalfunctioning when the only psychological symptoms arebehavioural and non-specic for example, distressand agitation when the woman does not speak English or is froman ethnic minority group. Booking, history-taking and basic observations All maternity-care providers, and in particular midwives and GPs, must recognise the crucial importance of: taking a comprehensive history and making a correctrisk assessment at booking referring the woman to the obstetrician or other spe-cialist as necessary following up these referrals to ensure appropriateaction has been taken making, recording and acting upon basic observations re-assessing the woman's risk status throughout herpregnancy and in the postnatal period. The antenatal booking history One of the most important events in the woman'smaternity care is the antenatal booking history appoint-ment. It is the rst opportunity to assess her well-beingand determine her 'risk status'. The majority of mater-nity records currently use a 'tick box' format. In manyrecords of the women who died, the information docu-mented was insufcient to enable risk assessment or anBack to basics \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 19appropriate pathway of care to be planned. In other women, a full history was taken and all informationappropriately recorded, but no appropriate follow up orreferral was made. This meant that some women whohad risk factors were booked for midwifery-led care. It is vitally important that when a woman reports a 'risk fac- tor', the midwife asks for additional relevant information,records this in detail and acts upon it. Communicating with the GP Midwives must ensure that history-taking is comprehen-sive, includes two-way communication with the woman'sGP and ensures timely referral to obstetrician and/or other specialist where necessary. The importance of midwife-GP communication cannot be over-emphasised, particularly asmidwifery services are now offered in a range of locations,including Children's Centres. Communication between GPs and midwives Midwives should notify GPs that a woman is preg- nant. Midwives should seek additional information fromthe GP if risk factors are identied. GPs should inform midwives about prior medicaland mental health problems. There should be auditable robust local systems inplace to enable two-way flow of information throughout pregnancy and the postnatal period. Using basic observations to assess and act upon risk status Midwives and GPs should be alert to changes in the woman's situation and that her risk status may change several times during the course of the pregnancy and the postnatal period. If a woman complains of any symptomsthat indicate a deviation from the norm, the midwife orGP must take basic observations, which include tempera-ture, pulse and respirations. If observations are found tobe abnormal, these must be followed up by appropriatereferral to GP or hospital. Following this referral, themidwife has a duty to make sure appropriate action has been taken. In a number of women, it was clear that the women who reported pain, temperature and feeling unwellhad appropriate midwifery care, with basic observationsbeing performed and appropriate referral and follow upmade. However, there were other situations wheremidwives did not respond appropriately to these com-plaints, failing to make basic observations or act on abnormal results.Improving communications and referrals In many cases reported to the Enquiry, there were major failures of communication between healthcare workers,which undoubtedly contributed to the woman's death insome cases. Notably, these included GPs not being asked for information or being consulted about further referral and, in some cases, the GP not being informed that thewoman was pregnant. In addition, the assessors havebeen struck by the lack of further referral by hospitalobstetricians of potentially high-risk women. The reasonsfor failure to refer are likely to be multiple. However,medical care is advancing rapidly, and patterns of thedelivery of care in the UK are changing. It must be appreciated that not all maternity centres can care for pregnant women with major complications either preced-ing or developing in pregnancy. If women with underly-ing medical or psychiatric conditions are to share in theadvances in medicine, all mothers who require it shouldbe referred to specialised centres for their care in preg-nancy; this was not usually the case among the womenwho died. In many cases reported to the Enquiry, referral for spe- cialist input (for example neurological or psychiatric con-sultation) was made by a healthcare worker, including GPs,midwives and obstetricians; however, there was a subse-quent inappropriate delay in sending an appointment orthe woman was not seen. Referrals to and from any health professional, including initial GP/midwife referral letter Remember, referral is not treatment. Explain the importance of keeping the appoint- ment.

Email: gwyneth.lewis@npeu.ox.ac.uk Introduction This, the eighth Report of the United Kingdom (UK) En- quiries into Maternal Deaths, now known as Saving Moth- ers' Lives , continues the 56-year unbroken series of reviews of maternal deaths undertaken to save more mothers' livesand, more generally, to improve maternity services overall.Although the style and content of the Reports has changedover this time, the essential aims and objectives remain thesame. It is because of the sustained commitment of all health professionals who provide maternity and other ser- vices for pregnant women in the UK that this Enquiry con-tinues to be a highly respected and powerful force forimprovements in maternal health, both here in the UK andinternationally. As stated in previous Reports, and equallyvalid today, reading the Report or preparing a statementfor an individual enquiry forms a crucial part of individual,professional, self-reflective learning. As long ago as 1954, it was recognised that participating in a condential enquiry had a 'powerful secondary effect' in that 'each participantin these enquiries, however experienced he or she may be,and whether his or her work is undertaken in a teachinghospital, a local hospital, in the community or the woman'shome must have beneted from their educative effect'. 1 Personal experience is therefore recognised as a valuabletool for harnessing benecial changes in individual prac- tice. Whereas many of the earlier Reports focused mainly on clinical issues, more recent Reports, as with the very earliestones in the 1950s, have also focused on the wider public-health issues that contribute to poorer health and socialoutcomes. As a result, their ndings and recommendationshave played a major part in helping in the development ofbroader policies designed to help reduce health inequalities for the poorest of our families and for the most vulnerable and socially disadvantaged women. Particularly strikinghave been successive Governments' commitments to reducethe wide variations in maternal mortality rates between themost and least advantaged mothers as identied by theseReports. By acting on similar ndings in past Reports, thisEnquiry has also played a major part in dening the phi-losophy of our maternity services that now expect eachindividual woman and her family to be at the heart of maternity services designed to meet her own particular needs, rather than vice versa . Telling the story The methodology used by the Enquiry goes beyond count- ing numbers. Its philosophy, and that of those who partici-pate in its process, is to recognise and respect everymaternal death as a young woman who died before her time, a mother, a member of a family and of her commu- nity. It does not demote women to numbers in statisticaltables; it goes beyond counting numbers to listen and tellthe stories of the women who died so as to learn lessonsthat may save the lives of other mothers and babies, as wellas aiming to improve the standard of maternal health over-all. Consequently, its methodology and philosophy con-tinue to form a major part of the strategies of the World Health Organization (WHO) and its sister United Nations organisations and other donor agencies to reduce maternaldeaths. The WHO maternal mortality review tool kit, andprogramme, Beyond the Numbers , 2includes advice and practical steps in choosing and implementing one or moreof ve possible approaches to maternal death reviewsadaptable at any level and in any country. Theseapproaches are facility and community death reviews, Con- dential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths, near-miss reviews and clinical audit. 3This work, in modied form, is now undertaken in more than 54 countries, including many ofthose with the poorest outcomes. Learning lessons for continual improvement This Enquiry is the oldest example of the use of the mater- nal mortality and morbidity surveillance cycle, now inter-nationally adopted by the WHO programme Beyond the Numbers, which promotes the use of maternal death or morbidity reviews to make pregnancy safer. 2The cycle, shown in Figure 1, is an ongoing process of deciding which deaths to review and identifying the cases, collecting andassessing the information, using it for recommendations,Lewis 22 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203implementing these and evaluating their impact before rening and improving the next cycle. The ultimate pur-pose of the surveillance process is action, not simply the counting of cases and calculation of rates. All these steps: identication, data collection and analysis, action and eval-uation, are crucial and need to be continued to justify theeffort and to make a difference. The impact of previousndings of this Report continually demonstrate the contri-bution of such an observational study to both maternaland child health and the overall public health, and empha-sise the need for it to continue in the future. This will be particularly important as our maternity services face new challenges, such as a rising birth rate, more migrant womenwith difcult pregnancies, those who do not speak English,an increasing number of older mothers and those who havecomplex pre-existing maternal diseases and, underlyingthis, a generation of women who are not as t and healthyas their own mothers were in the past. Sentinel event reporting ''Because of the very small numbers of deaths consideredby the Enquiry, it is not always possible to demonstratestatistically signicant changes in the maternal death andother rates generated by the Reports, particularly withinsmaller causal subgroups. As history has shown, this doesnot, however, diminish the impact of its ndings. 4Never- theless, the development of 'near-miss' studies, such as those conducted through the United Kingdom ObstetricSurveillance System (UKOSS), which works closely along-side this Enquiry, means that it is now possible to conductstudies with greater statistical power and so introduce anadditional degree of statistical rigour to the ndings. 5,6 Even before this development, the observational method-ology used has always been able to generate hypotheses, show trend lines and make recommendations that have led to improvements in maternal health, as the dramaticdecline in deaths from thromboembolism reported in thisReport shows. Although the methodology, best describedas an observational and self-reflective study, cannot ever be statistically powerful for the reasons cited above, itsndings are still useful and important. The Enquiry haslong identied patterns of clinical practice, service provi-sion and public-health issues that may be causally related to maternal deaths. This method of reviewing individual deaths has been described by Rutstein et al. 7as 'sentinel event reporting'. Just as the investigation of an aeroplane accident goes beyond the immediate reasons for the crash to the impli- cations of the design, method of manufacture, mainte-nance and operation of the plane, so should the study ofunnecessary undesirable health events yield crucial infor-mation on the scientic, medical, social and personal fac-tors that could lead to better health. Moreover, theevidence collected will not be limited to the factors thatyield only to measures of medical control. If there is clear cut documented evidence that identiable social, environ- mental, ''life-style'', economic or genetic factors areresponsible for special varieties of unnecessary disease,disability, or untimely death, these factors should beidentied and eliminated whenever possible''. It is this which Saving Mothers' Lives aims to achieve. The evidence base In the past, some have questioned whether the Reports are 'evidence based'. The highest level of evidence of clinical effectiveness comes from systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials, but these are simply not possible for most ofthe questions raised in relation to a maternal death (in devel-oped countries, at least), so observational methodologies arethe only way to address them. By conducting a national study,many of the biases traditionally attributed to centre-basedobservational studies, such as case-selection bias, are elimi-nated, so producing much higher quality evidence. The most comprehensive and up-to-date systematic reviews of relevance to these Enquiries are produced by theCochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group, whose editorialstructure is funded by the NHS Central Programme forResearch and Development. The Co-ordinating Editor of theGroup is a member of the editorial board of this Enquiry. Some Cochrane reviews are of direct relevance to topics highlighted by deaths described in recent Reports and have been cited to support recommendations. These include treatments for eclampsia and pre-eclampsia and antibioticprophylaxis before caesarean section. However, many prob-lems tackled in successive Reports have not been addressedby randomised trials, including prevention of thromboem-bolic disease and treatment of amniotic fluid embolism ormassive obstetric haemorrhage.1.

The maternal mortality or morbidity surveillance cycle.Introduction: Aims, objectives and denitions used in this Report \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 23An important limitation of randomised trials is that, unless they are very large, they may provide little informa-tion about rare, but important, complications of treatments.Safety issues are, therefore, sometimes better illuminated byobservational studies than by controlled trials. Many causes of maternal death are very rare, and treat- ment options for these may never be subjected to formalscientic study. Inevitably, recommendations for care toavoid such deaths in the future rely on lesser levels of evi-dence, and frequently on 'expert opinion'. This does notmean that the Report is not evidence-based, merely that,necessarily, the evidence cannot be in the form of a rando-mised controlled trial or case-control study because of the relative rarity of the condition. The use of vignettes and recommendations The Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE) policy on the use of vignettes and the development of rec-ommendations is available on the website at www.cma- ce.org.uk. In the past, some Reports have been characterised by the use of a signicant number of detailed vignettes, stories thatbroadly describe the circumstances surrounding the deathsof individual women and the lessons that may be drawnfrom them. Recognising that ensuring that everyone, includ-ing family members and professional staff, require completereassurance about the guiding principle of maintaining con- dentiality out of respect for those who have died, the number of vignettes has been reduced, as have some of themore identiable details given in them. CMACE only usesvignettes to help in the identication of lessons learnt forthe improvement of future professional practice or overallservice delivery. The vignettes used in this Report do notinclude the full circumstances of any individual case. Theyneither provide nor imply a complete overall assessment or judgement of the totality of care provided in a case, although they may point to where general lessons may belearnt from particular aspects of care. Individual details invignettes may be changed to protect the anonymity of thewoman. CMACE cannot conrm or deny the identity ofany individual woman, aspects of whose care may beincluded within a vignette, because all records used in theEnquiry are destroyed before publication of the Report. Further details on the method of enquiry are included in Appendix 1 of this Report. Severe maternal morbidity, 'near misses' It is increasingly recognised that the study of near-miss morbidity can complement enquiries into maternal deathand provide valuable additional information to guide pre- vention and treatment of potentially life-threatening condi-tions. Maternal deaths represent the tip of the iceberg ofdisease; a much larger number of women suffer from near-miss morbidity, increasing the power of these studies to investigate risk factors for both the occurrence of disease and progression to death and other severe complications.In this Report, the latest results of two systems for severemorbidity or 'near-miss' surveillance are reported inAppendix 2 and, where relevant, in the individual Chaptersdescribing the rates of clinical causes of death. These arethe UKOSS 5,6and the Scottish Condential Audit of Severe Maternal Morbidity (SCASMM).8 The UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) Surveillance of specic near-miss maternal morbidities and other rare disorders of pregnancy has been conductedthrough the UKOSS since 2005. 1UKOSS is an active, nega- tive surveillance system. Cases are actively sought through a routine monthly mailing to nominated reporting obstetri- cians, midwives, risk management midwives and anaesthe-tists in all consultant-led maternity units in the UK. Allconsultant-led units participate in UKOSS reporting.Clinicians are asked to complete the monthly report cardindicating whether there has been a woman with one ofthe conditions under study delivered in the unit during theprevious month. They are also asked to complete a 'nil report' indicating if there have not been any cases; this allows participation to be monitored and conrmsthe denominator population for calculation of diseaseincidence. In response to a report of a case, collaborating clinicians are sent a data collection form asking for further demo-graphic and pregnancy information, as well as details of diag-nosis, management and outcomes for mother and infant. For some conditions, clinicians are also asked to supply details about a comparison woman delivered in the same unit. This system allows for a rolling programme of parallel studies to be conducted, and, because case-control andcohort studies may be carried out as well as descriptivestudies, a range of research questions can be addressed. Inaddition to estimating disease incidence or prevalence,UKOSS studies can be used to quantify risk and prognostic factors, audit national management and prevention guide- lines and describe disease management, as well as describeoutcomes for both mothers and their infants. Descriptive,case-control and cohort studies are conducted and peer-reviewed papers are published. Further details of surveil-lance of near-miss morbidities using UKOSS are includedin the relevant chapters of this report, and key points aresummarised in Appendix 2A.Lewis 24 \u00aa2011 Centre BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203Scottish Condential Audit of Severe Maternal Morbidity An audit of a range of dened severe maternal morbidities has been carried out continuously in all consultant-led maternity units in Scotland since 2003. The methodology issimilar to that of UKOSS, with a designated midwife coor-dinator in each unit who identies cases and sends com-pleted data to the Reproductive Health Programme of NHSQuality Improvement Scotland, which analyses the dataand produces an annual report. 8Particularly detailed infor- mation is collected and analysed for all cases of major obstetric haemorrhage and of eclampsia. For these two conditions, each unit also provides a self-assessment of thequality of care provided. The continuous nature of theaudit using identical criteria and case denitions over sev-eral years has allowed the identication of changes in therates of some morbidities, as well as assessment of compli-ance with guidelines and changes in clinical management. Appendix 2B is a summary of the ndings from SCASMM for the triennium 2006-2008, and some information from the audit is included in other relevant chapters. The aims and objectives of the Enquiry The overall aim is to save the lives of as many mothers and newborns as possible through the expert anonymous review of the circumstances surrounding and contributing to each maternal death in the UK. Apart from the specic issuesand learning points that may emerge from certain cases orcauses of death, the ndings from individual cases are alsoaggregated together to learn wider lessons and to formulateand disseminate more general recommendations. Its objectives are: to improve the care that pregnant and recently deliv- ered women receive and to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates still further, as well as the propor-tion of deaths caused by substandard care. to assess the main causes of and trends in maternal deaths and, where possible, severe morbidity and toidentify any avoidable, remediable or substandard fac-tors that could be changed to improve care; to promul-gate these ndings and subsequent recommendations to all relevant healthcare professionals and to ensure that their uptake is audited and monitored. to make recommendations concerning the improve- ment of clinical care and service provision, includinglocal audit, to commissioners of obstetric services andto providers and professionals involved in caring forpregnant women. to suggest directions for future areas for research and audit at a local and national level.to contribute to regular shorter reports on overall trends in maternal mortality as well as producing amore in-depth triennial Report. The Enquiry's role in the provision of high-quality clinical care Although the Enquiry has always had the support of pro- fessionals involved in caring for pregnant or recently deliv-ered women, it is also a requirement that all maternaldeaths should be subject to this condential enquiry, andall health professionals have a duty to provide the informa-tion required. In participating in this Enquiry, all health professionals are asked for two things: if they have been caring for a woman who died, to provide the Enquiry with a full, accurate and unbiasedaccount of the circumstances leading up to her death,with supporting records, and irrespective of whether they have been caring for a woman who died or not, to reflect on and take any actions that may be required, either personally or as part of their wider institution, as a result of the recom-mendations and lessons contained within this Report. At a local commissioning level, maternity healthcare commissioners, such as Primary Care Trusts and LocalHealth Boards, should commission services which meet therecommendations set out in this and previous Reports andensure that all staff participate in the Enquiry if required, as part of their contract. At service provider level, the ndings of the Enquiry should be used: to ensure that all staff are regularly updated and trained on the signs and symptoms of critical illness,such as infection, and the early identication, manage-ment and resuscitation of seriously ill women to develop and regularly update multidisciplinary guidelines for the management of complications during or after pregnancy to review and modify, where necessary, the existing arrangements for the provision of maternity or obstet-ric care to ensure that all Direct and unexpected Indirect mater- nal deaths are subject to a local review and critical inci-dent report, which is made available to the Enquiry as part of its own process of review, as well as disseminat- ing its key ndings and recommendations to all localmaternity staff to introduce an obstetric early warning system chart as recommended in this and previous Reports to promote local audit and clinical governance. At a national level\u2014in every country, the ndings of successive Reports have been used to develop nationalIntroduction: Aims, objectives and denitions used in this Report \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 25maternal and public health-policies. example, the nd- ings of the Enquiry are used: To help in developing government policy.

This means that there was both a temporal and acausal link between pregnancy and the death. When the woman died, she could have been pregnant at the time, that is, she died before delivery, or within the previous6 weeks have had a pregnancy that ended in a live birth orstillbirth, a spontaneous or induced abortion or an ectopicpregnancy. The pregnancy could have been of any gesta-tional duration. In addition, this denition means that thedeath was directly or indirectly caused by the fact that thewoman was or had recently been pregnant. Either a com- plication of pregnancy, a condition aggravated by preg- nancy or something that happened during the course ofcaring for the pregnant woman caused her death. In otherwords, if the woman had not been pregnant, she wouldnot have died at that time. Maternal deaths are subdivided into further groups as shown in Table 1. Direct maternal deaths are those result- ing from conditions or complications or their management that are unique to pregnancy, occurring during the antena- tal, intrapartum or postpartum periods. Indirect maternal deaths are those resulting from previously existing disease,or disease that develops during pregnancy not as the resultof direct obstetric causes, but which were aggravated by Table 1. Denitions of maternal deaths Maternal deaths** Deaths of women while pregnant or within 42 days of the end of the pregnancy* from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes. Direct** Deaths resulting from obstetric complications of the pregnant state (pregnancy, labour and puerperium), from interventions, omissions, incorrect treatment or from a chain of events resulting from any of the above. Indirect** Deaths resulting from previous existing disease, or disease that developed during pregnancy and which was not the result of direct obstetric causes, but which was aggravated by the physiological effects of pregnancy. Late*** Deaths occurring between 42 days and 1 year after abortion, miscarriage or delivery that are the result of Direct orIndirect maternal causes. Coincidental (Fortuitous)**** Deaths from unrelated causes which happen to occur in pregnancy or the puerperium. *This term includes delivery, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage or pregnancy. **ICD 9 ***ICD 10**** ICD 9/10 classies these deaths as Fortuitous but the Enquiry prefers to use the term Coincidental as it a more accurate description. The Enquiry also considers deaths from Late Coincidental causes.Lewis 26 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203physiological effects of pregnancy. Examples of causes of Indirect deaths include epilepsy, diabetes, cardiac disease and, in the UK only, hormone-dependent malignancies.The Enquiry also classies most deaths from suicide asIndirect deaths because they were usually the result of puer- peral mental illness, although this is not recognised in the ICD coding of such deaths. The UK Enquiry assessors alsoclassify some deaths from cancer in which the hormone-dependent effects of the malignancy could have led to itsprogress being hastened or modied by pregnancy as Indi- rect, although these also do not accord with international denitions. Only Direct and Indirect deaths are counted for statistical purposes, as discussed later in the section on measuring maternal mortality rates. Some women die of causes apparently unrelated to preg- nancy. These deaths include deaths from all causes , includ- ing accidental and incidental causes. Although the latterdeaths, which would have occurred even if the woman hadnot been pregnant, are not considered true maternaldeaths, they often contain valuable lessons for this Enquiry.For example, they provide messages and recommendations about domestic abuse or the correct use of seat belts. From the assessments of these cases, it is often possible to makeimportant recommendations. The ICD coding classiesthese cases as fortuitous maternal deaths .However, in the opinion of the UK assessors, the use of the term fortuitouscould imply a happier event, and this Report, as did thelast, names these deaths as Coincidental. Late maternal deaths are dened as the death of a woman from Direct orIndirect causes more than 42 days but <1 completed year after the end of the pregnancy.Identifying Late maternal deaths enables lessons to be learnt from those deaths in which a woman had problemsthat began with her pregnancy, even if she survived formore than 42 days after its end. However, although thiscategory has only been recently recognised in the ICD 10codes, and then only for deaths from Direct orIndirect causes, the previous four UK Enquiry Reports had already included all Late deaths notied to the assessors (includingCoincidental deaths) occurring up to 1 year after delivery or abortion. For this Report, only Late deaths from Direct causes or from suicide and cardiac disease have beenincluded, and then only up to 6 months after delivery. It isimportant to continue to track and investigate these deaths, as advances in medicine and new technologies, particularly in critical care, are already enabling very sick mothers tolive beyond the standard 42-day cutoff point. Examplesinclude cardiomyopathy and acute fatty liver of pregnancy,which may require a heart or liver transplant. As this Report goes to press, the WHO is working on developing a possible revised classication system. Detailsof this will be published in the next Report and it is likely that the UK system of including deaths from suicide will be adopted as will a larger number of categories of Indirect deaths. Maternal mortality ratios and rates Table 2 shows maternal morality denitions used in this report. The international denition of the maternal mortal- ity ratio is the number of Direct and Indirect deaths per 100 000 live births. In many countries, this is difcult tomeasure because of the lack of death certicate data(should they exist at all) as well as a lack of basic denomi-nator data, as baseline vital statistics are also not availableor are unreliable. The recent WHO publication ' Beyond The Numbers; reviewing maternal deaths and disabilities tomake pregnancy safe ', 2contains a more detailed examina- tion and evaluation of the problems in both determining a baseline maternal mortality ratio and interpreting what itactually means in helping to address the problems facingpregnant women in most developing countries. Conversely, the UK has the advantage of accurate denomi- nator data, including both live births and stillbirths, and hasdened its maternal mortality rate as the number of Direct and Indirect deaths per 100 000 maternities as a more accu- rate denominator to indicate the number of women at risk. Maternities are dened as the number of pregnancies that Table 2.

The internationally dened maternal mortality ratio: the number of Direct and Indirect deaths per 100 000 live birthsFor international comparison, although care needs to be taken in its interpretation because of the more accurate case ascertainment in the UK through the use of this Enquiry. Deaths from obstetric causes per 100 000 estimated pregnancies. Because the data from spontaneous abortions and ectopic pregnancies are unreliable, this denominator is only used when calculating rates of death in early pregnancy.Introduction: Aims, objectives and denitions used in this Report \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 27result in a live birth at any gestation or stillbirths occurring at or after 24 completed weeks of gestation and are requiredto be notied by law. This enables a more detailed picture ofmaternal mortality rates to be established and is used for thecomparison of trends over time. Furthermore, in the UK maternal mortality rate can be calculated in two ways: through ofcial death certication to the Registrars General (the Ofce for National Statistics [ONS] andits equivalents), or through deaths known to this Enquiry. The overall maternal mortality rate is calculated from the number of Direct and Indirect deaths. The ONS data are based on death certicates where the cause of death is directly or secondarily coded for a pregnancy-related condi-tion, such as postpartum haemorrhage, eclampsia etc. For the past 50 years the Enquiry has calculated its own maternal mortality rate, because the overall number ofmaternal deaths identied by the proactive case-ndingmethodology used by this Enquiry has always exceededthose ofcially reported. This is because not all maternal deaths are recorded as such on death certicates. For exam- ple, a large proportion of women known to the Enquirywho died of pre-existing medical conditions influenced bytheir pregnancy, for example cardiac disorders, epilepsyand some malignancies, were excluded from the ofcial sta-tistics. Other women excluded from ofcial data are thosewho required long-term intensive care and whose nalcause of death was registered as a nonpregnancy condition, such as multiple organ failure, even though the initiating cause was an obstetric event. Conversely, the maternaldeaths known to the Registrars General may include Late deaths because it is not possible to identify from the deathcerticate when the delivery or termination occurred. To aid the international comparison of the UK data with those from other countries calculated by using the ICD-dened Maternal Mortality Ratio, this Report has also cal- culated the overall UK maternal mortality ratio as well as the more complete Enquiry maternal mortality rate. Theseare shown in Chapter 1. However, when making such com-parisons, it is important to note two points: The criteria used by the UK assessors for Indirect deaths are far more inclusive than those used in other countries.For example, in this Enquiry all cases of cardiac disease,asthma and epilepsy are coded as Indirect, as are cases of suicide unless obviously occurring in women with a longstanding previous psychiatric history. Case ascertainment is lower in the vast majority of other countries because they do not undertake suchcomprehensive enquiries. These two facts alone increase the UK maternal mortality rate when compared with other countries, and this is dis-cussed in more detail in Chapter 1.Case ascertainment The role of the Ofce for National Statistics Since the introduction of a new ONS computer program in 1993, all conditions given anywhere on the death certicate are now coded, enabling a more extensive search of deathentry information to identify all conditions listed that sug-gest a maternal death. In the past, this has helped inimproving case ascertainment, with a number of previouslyunreported deaths being identied. Fortunately, for thisReport, the ONS record linkage study described below hasidentied very few additional cases of Direct orIndirect deaths. This is a reduction in the already small degree of under-ascertainment calculated for previous Reports. For the past 9 years, ONS has been able to match death records of women of fertile age living in England andWales with birth registrations up to 1 year previously. Theaim is to identify deaths of all women in England andWales who died within 1 year of giving birth and to seehow many additional cases can be found. The methodol- ogy, used in the past two triennia, was again applied for this Report and again shows that the majority of thesedeaths occurred Late, i.e. some months after delivery. The vast majority of these Late deaths were the result of Coinci- dental Late causes, and these are shown in Chapter14. The ONS does not service Scotland, where maternal death case ascertainment is achieved using informationfrom the General Register Ofce for Scotland, the Repro- ductive Health Programme of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and the wider clinical community. Denominator data used for calculating mortality rates Number of maternities It is impossible to know the exact number of pregnancies that occurred during this or any preceding triennium, because not all pregnancies result in a registered live birthor stillbirth. These data are unreliable because of the lackof appropriate denominators, so the most commondenominator used throughout this and previous Reports isthe number of maternities rather than the total number ofpregnancies. Maternities are the number of pregnanciesthat result in a live birth at any gestation or stillbirths occurring at or after 24 completed weeks of gestation and are required to be notied by law. The total number ofmaternities for the UK for 2006-08 was 2 291 493. Estimated pregnancies This denominator is used for calculating the rate of earlypregnancy deaths. It is a combination of the number ofmaternities, together with legal terminations, hospital admis-Lewis 28 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203sions for weeks of gesta- tion) and ectopic pregnancies with an adjustment to allowfor the period of gestation and maternal ages at conception.The estimate for the UK 2006-08 was 3 139 315. However,the resulting total is still an underestimate of the actual num- ber of pregnancies because these gures do not include other pregnancies that miscarry early, those where the woman isnot admitted to hospital, or indeed those where the womanherself may not even know she is pregnant.

Email: gwyneth.lewis@npeu.ox.ac.uk Keywords Condential Enquiry, maternal, mortality. Statistical analysis by Anna Springett 'Whose are the faces behind the numbers? What were their stories? What were their dreams? They left behindchildren and families. They also left behind clues as towhy their lives ended so early.' 1 Summary of key points The maternal mortality rate, calculated from all maternalmortality Directly orIndirectly due to pregnancy identi- ed by this Enquiry, for 2006-08 was 11.39 (95% CI 10.09-12.86) per 100 000 maternities compared with the 13.95 (95% CI 12.45-15.64) per 100 000 maternitiesreported for the previous triennium, 2003-05. There hastherefore been a statistically signicant decline in theoverall UK maternal mortality rate as calculated by thisEnquiry for the years 2006-08 compared with the 2003-05 triennium ( P= 0.02a). There has been a signicant downward trend in the maternal mortality rate among Black African women (P= 0.003) and also for women from White ethnic back- grounds ( P= 0.04) over the last three triennia (9 years). Women with partners who were unemployed or whose jobs were unclassied were nearly six times ( P< 0.001) more likely to die from maternal causes than womenwith husbands or partners in employment. Although stilla yawning gap, this measure of inequality has also signif- icantly reduced and is part of a downward trend from 2000 to 2002 when the difference was 12-fold(P< 0.001), and 2003-05 when there was a seven-fold difference ( P< 0.001). Currently it is not possible to cal- culate rates for single mothers because these data are notroutinely collected. There has also been a marked reduction in the differencein maternal mortality in relation to the area of mothers'residence. The death rate for women living in the mostdeprived quintile, dened by postcode and area depriva-tion scores, reduced since the lastReport for 2003-05 ( P= 0.01). Clinical causes of death The maternal mortality rate for mothers who died from medical conditions that could only be the result ofpregnancy, such as obstetric haemorrhage or eclampsia,and which are internationally classied as Direct deaths signicantly decreased ( P= 0.02) to 4.67 (95% CI 3.86-5.64) triennium compared with the rate of6.24 (95% CI 5.27-7.40) per 100 000 maternities for2003-05. The main reason for the decline in deaths from Direct causes is a signicant reduction in deaths from throm-boembolism and, to a lesser extent, from other Direct conditions such as haemorrhage. The prevention andmanagement of these two life-threatening conditionshas been subject to national clinical guidelines andstandards, arising in part from previous recommenda-tions in earlier Reports of this Enquiry. The case fatality rate from ectopic pregnancy hasalmost halved from an estimated 31.2 (95% CI 16.8-57.9) per 100 000 estimated ectopic pregnancies for2003-05 to 16.9 (95% CI 7.6-37.6) for this triennium(P= 0.23). These ndings, though not statistically sig- nicant, suggest that previous messages concerning theprompt diagnosis of this potentially fatal conditionmay have been heeded at last. However, there remains room for improvement. aAP-value is a measure of probability that a difference between groups happened by chance. For example, a P-value of 0.02 ( P= 0.02) means that there is a 1 in 50 chance the result occurred by chance. The lower theP-value, the less likely that the difference seen is due to chance. The statistical signicance is usually set at P= 0.05, but this is open to interpretation, as there is no hard and fast cutoff point.Lewis 30 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203Although the overall rate for Direct maternal deaths has decreased, deaths from infection of the genital tract(sepsis), largely from community-acquired Group Astreptococcal disease, have risen. The overall rate hasincreased to 1.13 deaths (95% CI 0.77-1.67) per 100 000 maternities compared CI 0.54- 1.35) for 2003-05 ( P= 0.35). Although this mirrors an increase in the background rate of this disease, thendings nevertheless cause concern. As a result, theCentre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE) hasalready published this information to enable the publichealth professionals to be aware of the risks of trans-mission of Group A Streptococcus and the importance of good hygiene to prevent transmission, early diagno- sis and timely and correct treatment. This is especiallyrelevant for pregnant and recently delivered womenwhose immune systems are more vulnerable. The mortality rate for mothers' deaths from Indirect causes, that is from pre-existing or new medical ormental health conditions aggravated by pregnancy suchas heart disease or suicide, remains largely unchanged. The rate for 2006-08, at 6.72 (95% CI 5.74-7.87) per 100 000 maternities, has not signicantly altered(P= 0.22) from the 7.71 (95% CI 6.61-8.99) per 100 000 maternities identied in the last Report. Since1994, the numbers and rates of maternal deaths fromIndirect causes have been consistently higher than those forDirect deaths. For international comparison, the UK Maternal Mortal- ity Ratio (MMR; Maternal Mortality Ratio = number ofDirect and Indirect maternal deaths divided by the number of live births [ICD 10; see Introduction chapterto this Report]) to be used for 2006-08 is 6.69 (95%CI 5.72-7.84) per 100 000 live births. This is calculatedonly from those Direct and Indirect maternal deaths notied on death certicates, the method used by allother countries. Maternal mortality rates for 2006-08 The UK maternal mortality rates can be calculated by twodifferent methods, each of which produces a different rate.One is based on the use of routine death certicate dataalone, the method used in other countries, and the other isbased on the results of this much more in-depth enquiry. Routine death certicate data and deriving the internationally comparable UK maternal mortalityratio This, the lower of the two rates that can be calculated for the UK, as shown in Table 1.1, is calculated from ofcial death certication to the Registrars General [the Ofce forNational Statistics (ONS) and its equivalents]. The totalnumber of maternal deaths that occurred in the UKbetween 2006 and 2008 ascertained from death certicate data alone was 155, giving a UK maternal mortality rate of 6.76 (95% CI 5.78-7.92) per 100 000 maternities. The numbers of maternities in the UK, shown in Table 1.1, are used as the denominator for all the tables inthis Report apart from those relating to early pregnancydeaths. This differs from international practice in which thenumber of live births is used as the denominator and is usedto calculate what is internationally dened as the MMR (See the Introduction chapter to this Report). By applying this denominator to the routine data collected through deathcerticates, the UK MMR used for international compari-sons for 2006-08 is 6.69 per 100 000 live births (95% CI5.72-7.84). From the ndings of this Report, the UK MMRremains very low. However, in some other developed coun-tries, the MMR is rising. For example, recent surveys haveestimated that the overall MMR for the USA has almost doubled over the last 20 years to between 13.1 and 24 per 100 000 live births depending on the methodology used. 2,3 The UK Maternal Mortality Rate as calculated by this Enquiry The use of routine death certicate data to identify mater- nal deaths consistently underestimates the number ofwomen who die from pregnancy-related conditions, as also evidenced by the ndings in this Report. Therefore, by far the most accurate maternal mortality rate is that obtainedfrom the deaths identied by this Enquiry. Cases includedin this Report are those identied through routine deathcertication and through record linkage as well as a signi-cant number of additional cases reported to the EnquiryTable 1.1.

In this triennium an additional 106 deaths, 41% of the total of 261 maternal deaths, were identied and reportedto this Enquiry by maternity and other health professionals and the CMACE Regional Managers. These deaths would not have been identied by use of death certicates alonebecause the death certicate did not include a mention of apregnancy-related condition, a nding consistent with ear-lier Reports. The overall maternal mortality rate for thisEnquiry is therefore calculated from the number of all ofthese deaths which are considered by the Enquiry assessorsas being the result of Direct and Indirect causes. Because of the proactive case-nding methodology of this Enquiry, described in Appendix 1, the numbers of Direct and Indi- rect deaths identied always greatly exceeds those identied by death certicate data alone. The rate calculated by thisEnquiry is the ofcial one used by the Department ofHealth for UK data and UK trends, although the UKMMR, discussed earlier, is the one to be used for interna-tional comparison because it mirrors the method used in other countries. Key ndings for 2006-08 Numbers and rates As shown in Table 1.2, 261 women died from causes directly or indirectly related to their pregnancy, out of 2 291 493mothers who gave birth in the UK during the years 2006-08. Of these, 107 mothers died of conditions that could only have arisen if they had been pregnant ( Direct deaths), and 154 died of other underlying medical or psychiatric causes,such as heart disease or suicide caused by puerperal psycho-sis aggravated by their pregnancy ( Indirect deaths; See theIntroduction chapter to this Report). A cross-check between death certicates and the ONS record linkage study,described in the Introduction of this Report, shows that, aswith the last Report, all known Direct and Indirect maternal deaths in England and Wales were identied by this Enquiry and assessed by Condential Enquiry procedures. There is no record linkage system currently in place in Scotland orNorthern Ireland, but these are small countries where mater-nal deaths are unlikely to remain unnoticed, so coverage islikely to be virtually complete in any event. As shown in Figure 1.1, the overall UK maternal mortal- ity rate for the triennium 2006-08, as calculated by thisEnquiry, that is the total number of Direct and Indirect deaths combined per 100 000 maternities, was 11.39 (95% CI 10.09-12.86) deaths per 100 000 maternities. This is lessthan the rate of 13.95 (95% for the previ-ous Report for 2003-05 ( P= 0.02). This reduction is par- ticularly welcome because it took place at a time whenthere was a rising birth rate, placing a greater pressure onmaternity services, as well as an increasing proportion ofmothers who were not born in the UK who often require additional services and support ([www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/ nugget.asp?id=369]. Accessed 24 August 2010.). Direct deaths As shown in Figure 1.2, the mortality rate for maternal deaths from Direct causes of death was 4.67 (95% CI 3.86- 5.64) for this triennium compared with the rate of 6.24(95% CI 5.37-7.40) per 100 000 maternities given for the last Report 4(P= 0.02). There has been a signicant decline in deaths from Direct causes since 1985, as shown in Fig- ure 1.2 ( P= 0.07). The limitations placed on the Enquiry by adhering to the international denition of maternal deaths, as discussed Table 1.2.

However, in this Report, nine womendied of Late Direct causes later than this, and, although these cases are not included in the overall UK maternalmortality rate, the lessons drawn from them are discussedin the relevant Chapters of this Report. Indirect deaths For this triennium, the maternal mortality rate from Indi- rect causes, that is from pre-existing or new medical or mental health conditions aggravated by pregnancy such asheart disease or suicide, is 6.72 (95% CI 5.74-7.87) per100 000 maternities. The signicantly changedfrom the 7.71 (95% CI 6.61-8.99) per 100 000 maternitiesin the last Report ( P= 0.22). The numbers of maternal deaths from Indirect causes continue to outnumber Direct deaths, as has been seen in the past four Reports (Fig-ures 1.2 and 1.3). Although there has been a signicantincrease ( P< 0.001) in mortality rates from Indirect causes since 1985, this can probably be explained by far better caseascertainment and inclusion of cases that might have beenconsidered as Coincidental in the past, such as suicides and hormone-dependent malignancies. Rolling 3-year average mortality rates To provide more timely updates on general trends and anyemerging issues that require urgent attention, in futureCMACE will, in the 2 years between the 3-yearly publica-tion of these comprehensive Saving Mothers' Lives Reports, publish a short annual summary on maternities Figure 1.1. Direct and Indirect maternal mortality rates per Test for trend over period 1985-2008: P = 0.07 Figure 1.2.

As a baseline for these annual updates, Table 1.3 provides the rst of these 3-year rolling average UK maternal mortality rates since 2003. It showsthat there has been a continuing small decline in bothDirect and Indirect deaths ( P= 0.01). Deaths in pregnant women or new mothers up to 6 months after delivery or the end of pregnancywhich were not apparently to the result of, oraffected by, pregnancy Coincidental deaths To ascertain which of the deaths in pregnant or recently delivered women were directly orindirectly related to their pregnancy, it is important to assess all the cases of mothers who died while pregnant or in the 42 days following deliv-ery. Those deaths then found to be unrelated to pregnancyand which appear to be linked only by a temporal associa-tion are classied as being Coincidental. By international convention, these do not contribute to the statistics used tocalculate the UK maternal mortality rate determined by thisEnquiry (See the Introduction chapter to this Report). The deaths of 50 women who died of such Coincidental causes were assessed this triennium. This was a similar number tothe 55 identied in the last Report. However, althoughapparently unrelated to pregnancy, these deaths often con-tain important public-health messages, for example con- cerning domestic abuse, substance misuse and the use of seat belts, and are discussed in Chapter 12. Late deaths Late maternal deaths are internationally classied as those occurring between 6 weeks and 1 year (43-365 days) afterdelivery. They can be from Direct, Indirect orCoincidental causes, but none are included in the internationally dened maternal mortality rate. For over 15 years these have been regularly notied to the Enquiry through the record linkagesystem developed by the ONS, described in detail in earlierReports, latterly also assisted by the CMACE RegionalManagers. Experience has shown that although some of these deaths continue to reveal important lessons for for trend over period 1985-2008: P < 0.001 Figure 1.3.

The exceptions are those mothers who died fromLate Direct and Late Indirect causes. Late Direct deaths are important because, however long after delivery the terminal event occurred and even though their lives may have beenprolonged through intensive care or support, there areoften lessons to be learnt from the presentation or manage-ment of these mothers precipitating pregnancy-related orchildbirth-related events. There may also be crucial lessonsto be learnt from the deaths of mothers who died fromLate Indirect causes such as cardiomyopathy and suicide, which generally tend to occur some months after delivery. Thirty-three deaths, nine from Late Direct and 24 from Late Indirect causes, which occurred within 6 months of delivery, have been included and assessed and are listed inChapter 12 of this Report. CMACE did not collect infor-mation on any other type of Late death this triennium. The children left behind In the period of this Report, it is estimated that at least 331 existing children and 147 live newborn babies lost theirmother to a reported Direct orIndirect death. Of the exist- ing children whose mothers died a Direct orIndirect death, 26 were already in the care of social services, as were 23children whose mothers died from Coincidental causes, mainly related to substance misuse or violence. Any childwhose mother dies must face a far poorer start to family life. The fact that so many of the children were already liv- ing in complex circumstances with vulnerable families, orwere in care, continues to underscore the important pub-lic-health dimension of this Enquiry. The clinical reasons why mothers died Table 1.4 gives the numbers and maternal mortality rates per 100 000 maternities by specic cause of death by trien- nium, since 1985, when the Enquiry expanded to cover the whole of the UK. Table 1.5 shows the rates and 95% con- dence intervals for the main causes of maternal death inthe last three triennia for 2000-08 and Figure 1.4 shows the leading causes of maternal deaths for this triennium inranked order. Leading causes of death Direct deaths This triennium, there has been a change in the rankings of Direct deaths by cause. Unlike in previous Reports, the leading cause of Direct deaths for 2006-08 was genital tract infection, described here as sepsis, followed by pre-eclamp-sia/eclampsia, which keeps its second place ranking. Deathsfrom thromboembolism, the leading cause of death in theUK since 1985, have now dropped into third place, fol- lowed by those from amniotic fluid embolism. Deaths fromhaemorrhage have also dropped, to sixth place, followingthose in early pregnancy. Mortality from anaesthesiaremains very low and is still the seventh Direct cause. Over- all, the total numbers of Direct deaths have declined from 132 in the last Report to 107 in this. The decline in themortality rate from thromboembolism between the 2003-05 and 2006-08 triennia is statistically signicant(P< 0.001), but the changes in other rates are small enough to be chance ndings. It will be important to see ifthese changes are sustained in the Report for 2009-11. Indirect deaths Cardiac disease was again the leading cause of deaths fromIndirect causes as well as being the leading cause of death overall. Mortality rates for deaths from Other Indirectcauses due to pre-existing medical conditions and thosefrom neurological conditions are also higher than for theleading cause of Direct death, sepsis. Deaths from suicide, the leading cause of maternal deaths in 2000-02, have dropped a little more and now equal those from amniotic fluid embolism. The care the mothers received Antenatal care Table 1.6 shows the type of antenatal care provided for the mothers who died. The women who did not come for care Forty-one women who died from Direct orIndirect causes had no antenatal care. For 27 it was because they died inearly pregnancy before their 'booking' appointment, soonly 14 (6%) women who died in later pregnancy or afterdelivery received no antenatal care at all. Six of these con-cealed their pregnancies. Another 21 (8%) booked for care after 18 weeks of gestation. For another 11 women, these data were not available. These 35 mothers (13%) who diedand who had not 'booked' by 18 weeks of gestation con-trast with the 4% of mothers found not to have 'booked'with NHS maternity services by 18 weeks of gestation in astudy undertaken by the National Perinatal EpidemiologyUnit in 2006, covering the period of this Report. 5In 2010, the latest NHS vital signs survey by the Department of Health for England6reported that 87% of mothers were now booked by 13 weeks of gestation, compared with 58%of the women who died from Direct and Indirect causes in this Report. In addition to these late bookers, another 35(14%) women were poor attenders for care, giving a totalof 26% of the mothers who died from Direct and Indirect causes who were poor or nonattenders and, as a result, hadless than optimal antenatal care.Chapter 1: The women who died and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 35Table 1.4.

Many of these women saw amember of the obstetric staff once or twice to check thatall was well, and in the main their care was managed by amidwife. Forty-three (17%) of the mothers who died wereknown to have been at higher risk of complications, and their care was provided by the consultant-led maternity team, including obstetricians and midwives. These propor-tions have not changed since the last Report. Midwifery care Fifty-two (20%) of the women for whom information isavailable had entirely midwifery-led care. For most this wasappropriate, but this is discussed further in Chapter 13. This is double the number of women who received such care in the last Report, but this would be expected becauseit is in line with the policies for NHS maternity careexpressed in Maternity Matters 7and other documents. These policies support the role of the midwife as being the expert in the provision of routine antenatal and postnatalmaternity care and normal birth for women for whomthere are no known potential risk factors or complications.As a reflection of the changing nature of maternity serviceprovision, only 4% of women had their care sharedbetween midwives and their GPs. The women who died before delivery As shown in Table 1.7, 37% of women who died from Direct or Indirect causes were undelivered at the time of their death. For Direct deaths, the largest group were women who died in early pregnancy of miscarriage, ectopicpregnancy or sepsis. The causes of deaths among the Indi- rect deaths groups were varied between medical conditions including epilepsy and diabetes, as well as cardiac disease. Eight of the 11 women who were murdered and whose deaths were classied as Coincidental died while still preg-Table 1.5.

Many women who died from substance abuse also died during pregnancy, some from apparently 'accidental overdoses' following a case pro-tection conference where it had been suggested that thebaby be taken into care after birth. Seventeen of thesewomen who either died of an 'accidental overdose' or franksuicide are discussed in Chapter 11. The majority of theother Coincidental deaths in pregnancy were from road trafc accidents. The 10th revision of the International Classication of Diseases (ICD) recommends that live births and stillbirthsat 22 or more weeks of gestation should be included inall perinatal statistics. To date, this Report has used theUK denition of stillbirth, that is deaths at 24 or morecompleted weeks of gestation, the numbers for which aregiven in Table 1.7. If the UK stillbirth denition wasreduced to 22 weeks, then the death of a woman who died from Direct causes, one woman who died from Indi- rect causes and two from Coincidental causes deliveredbetween 22 and 23 completed weeks of gestation would have been included. Place of delivery The majority, 87%, of the 165 women who died from Direct orIndirect causes and who gave birth at 24 com- pleted weeks of gestation or more, delivered in an NHSconsultant-led maternity unit. This is shown in Table 1.8. Even though more women are delivering at home or in midwifery-led birth centres, this percentage is to be expected among these women because many would havehad underlying conditions for which it would have beenunsafe to deliver at home or in an isolated 'stand alone'midwifery unit.Seventeen women who were rushed to hospital undergoingcardiopulmonary resuscitation, having collapsed at homeor having been involved in a road trafc accident, were delivered in the Emergency Department by peri-mortem caesarean section.Table 1.7.

Type of delivery As shown in Table 1.9, 59% of the women who delivered, did so by caesarean section. It is important to note how-ever, that in many instances, the operation was performedto assist the mother or her baby after signicant illness or frank collapse had occurred. Thirty-ve percent of mothers had unassisted vaginal deliveries, a 5% increase on thedeaths that were described in the last Report. Caesarean section As shown in Table 1.9 and Box 1.1, this Enquiry uses the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG)denition of caesarean section. As discussed in earlier Reports, determining the balance of maternal and fetal risks for caesarean section is difcult, and for this Report, it wasvirtually impossible to disentangle the fetal and maternalreasons for most of the operations to make a meaningfulcomparison. Only one caesarean section was performed atmaternal request. The remaining women had serious prena-tal or intrapartum complications or illness that required acaesarean section to try to save either their or their baby's life. It was therefore not possible to distinguish between cause and effect for all but a very few women. Peri- or post-mortem caesarean section Table 1.10 shows the fetal outcomes of peri-/post-mortem caesarean sections by place of delivery. As would beexpected, there were poorer outcomes for babies whosemothers were already receiving cardiopulmonary resuscita- tion on admission to the Emergency Department comparedwith those whose mothers collapsed in a well-equipped hospital or near a delivery suite or operating theatre. Insome cases, the section will have been performed in anTable 1.9.

Gesta- tional age also plays a signicant part in the likelihood ofneonatal survival. Table 1.11 shows that the nearer to term the mother is when she collapses, the greater the chancesof the baby surviving. The quality of care the women received Box 1.2 gives the denitions of substandard care used in this Report.Despite limitations caused by some incomplete case reportsor the poor quality of case notes, the assessors classied70% of Direct deaths and 55% of Indirect deaths, as shown in Table 1.12, as having some degree of substandard care. Table 1.13 gives the degree of substandard care compared with the previous four Reports. Critical incident reports and internal reviews For this triennium, it was possible to identify the number of hospital critical incident reports undertaken, and theresults are shown in Table 1.14. Although it was not possi- ble to evaluate critically the quality of these in each indi-vidual's circumstances, a recurring theme throughout thisreport was the generally poor quality of many of these reports. Improving these is one of the Key Recommenda-tions of this Report. Many of the main causes of substandard care remain unchanged from previous Reports. These are discussed in more detail in the individual Chapters in this Report and addressed in many of the Key Recommendations in thisReport. The overarching challenges include the following. Improving clinical knowledge and skills A lack of clinical knowledge and skills among some doc-tors, midwives and other health professionals, senior orjunior, was one of the leading causes of potentially avoid- able mortality this triennium. One of the commonest nd- ings in this Report was the initial failure by many clinicalstaff, including GPs, Emergency Department staff, midwivesand hospital doctors, to immediately recognise and act onthe signs and symptoms of potentially life-threatening con-ditions. To help with this, the assessors have developed ashort new section, Back to basics , which is included in this Report for the rst time. This lack of clinical knowledge and skills was not only the case when distinguishing the signs and symptoms ofpotentially serious disease from the commonplace symp-toms of pregnancy in primary care or the EmergencyDepartment but also once a woman was hospitalised. Therewere a number of healthcare professionals who either failedto identify that a woman was becoming seriously ill or whofailed to manage emergency situations outside their imme- diate area of expertise, and did not call for advice and help. Identifying very sick women In many cases in this Report, the early warning signs and symptoms of impending severe maternal illness or collapsewent unrecognised. The early detection of severe illness inmothers remains a challenge to all involved in their care.The relative rarity of such events combined with the nor- mal changes in physiology associated with pregnancy and childbirth compounds the problem. Modied early warningscoring systems have been successfully introduced intoother areas of clinical practice, and the last Report gave anexample of a Modied Early Obstetric Warning System(MEOWS) chart. This is available on the CMACE websiteat www.cmace.org.uk. Their introduction for all pregnantor postpartum women who become unwell and require further treatment, including following obstetric interven- tions and gynaecological surgery, is one of the 'Top ten'recommendations of this Report. Improving the quality of serious incident/serious untoward incident reports The quality of the serious incident/serious untoward inci- dent report forms relating to maternal deaths assessed forTable 1.11.

Box 1.2. Denitions of substandard care used in this Report Major Contributed signicantly to the death of the mother. In many, but not all cases, different treatment may have altered the outcome. Minor It was a relevant contributory factor. Differ- ent management might have made a differ- ence, but the mother's survival was unlikely in any case.Chapter 1: The women who died 2006-2008 \u00aa2011 Centre for and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 41this report was highly variable with many being of dubious quality. The assessors considered some to be not worth thepaper they were written on and a few to be actually white-washes or cover ups for unacceptable situations. For these poor reports, there was little or no evidence of critical thinking, an acceptance of shortcomings, little or no self-reflective discussions and no evidence that obvious lessonshad been identied let alone learnt. In these cases, little orno action was taken on any results, and in many cases, staffwere not involved in the process or the follow up of any of the lessons learnt. This was a common nding throughout all the Chapters in this Report and one which all assessorsagree represents unacceptable practice that must be cor-rected as soon as possible. Improving senior support As in the last Report, some women were not seen by anappropriately trained senior or consultant doctor in time, and a few never saw a consultant doctor at all, despite, inTable 1.12.

The reasons for this were, generally, a lack of awareness of the severity ofthe woman's illness by more junior or locum maternitystaff, both doctors and midwives. In a few cases, the con-sultant(s) did not attend in person until too late and relied on giving advice over the phone. It was also evident from some of these cases that junior trainees and midwives in the front line seeing womenattending as emergencies did not have proper support andback up and needed to have had clear guidelines aboutwhen to seek senior help. They should not be expected tomanage sick women alone and, if they ask for help andreview, should be supported. Trainees need to communi- cate the gravity and urgency of the situation clearly when discussing women with consultants, who should ensure thatthey have asked enough questions to enable themselves toassess the situation fully and whether they need to attendin person. It is the responsibility of the consultants to pro-vide high-quality care for their patients, especially with theEuropean Working Time Directive introducing shift workand a lack of continuity of care. So, perhaps similarly to one of the 'Top ten' Recommendations of this Report, that junior doctors and midwives should have a lower thresholdfor referring 'upwards', consultants should accept a lowerthreshold for attending a woman when on call instead ofrelying on information provided over the phone. Asoccurred in some cases in this Enquiry, it is unacceptablethat women are not seen by a consultant even when admit-ted to a Critical-Care Unit. The RCOG in 2010 published guidance on the responsi- bility of consultants on call, and when they should attend. 8 A summary of this is shown in Boxes 1.3 and 1.4. Better management of higher risk women This triennium, the assessors have been struck by the lackof appropriate referral of potentially high-risk cases, andlack of consultant involvement remains a problem in the care of women with serious medical problems. Medical care is advancing rapidly, as are changes in the way 'routine' maternity care is provided in the UK, andwomen must not be disadvantaged by this. It must beappreciated that not all maternity centres are able or equipped to care for pregnant women with major compli-cations either preceding pregnancy or developing duringpregnancy. If women with underlying medical conditionsare to share in the advances in medicine, more will require referral to tertiary or specialist medical centres for their care in pregnancy. Pre-pregnancy counselling As in previous Reports, the ndings of this triennium showthat many of the women who died from pre-existing dis-eases or conditions that may seriously affect the outcomeof their pregnancies, or may require different management or specialised services during pregnancy, did not receive any pre-pregnancy counselling or advice. As a result, theircare was less than optimal, as neither they nor their carersrealised that closer surveillance or changes to medicationswere appropriate. Better referrals There were a number of cases in this Report of women dying before they had seen the specialist to whom they had been referred because of medical or psychiatric problems.Some women received appointments weeks after the origi-nal referral, despite clearly being very ill, because the pro-gress of the referral was not followed up. One or twowomen were also refused specialist services because of localcommissioning arrangements. Improving communication or communication skills Poor communication is used as a generic term, which covers:poor or non-existent team working; inappropriate or tooshort consultations by phone; the lack of sharing of relevantinformation between health professionals, including betweenGPs and the maternity team; poor interpersonal skills. Deciencies in all of these areas featured in many cases in this Report, as demonstrated in the vignettes described in each Chapter.Box 1.3.

Notably, these included GPs not beingasked for information or not being consulted about furtherreferral and, in some cases, the GP not being informed that the woman was pregnant. The converse was also true, with the GP not passing on information relevant to the woman'shealth and well-being. In addition, the assessors have beenstruck by the lack of further referral by hospital obstetri-cians to senior specialists of potentially high-risk cases. Underlying health status Age As in previous Reports, the recognised association betweenmaternal age and risk of pregnancy-related death, as shownin Table 1.15 and Figure 1.5, remains. In this, as in previous triennia, the highest maternal mortality rates are among theolder mothers. In this Report, the youngest mother who diedwas aged 15 and the oldest was 47 years of age. Four girlswho died were aged between 15 and 16, two of whom died from Direct causes, one of which occurred later in the post- natal year. Two of these were living in the care of social ser-vices and another was well known to them. Four of the tenyoung mothers aged between 17 and 19 years were alsoknown to social services. Two were also described as being'learning disabled', two used illegal drugs and one was con-sidered to be homeless, having been recently discharged fromthe care of social services.Parity The parity of the women who died is given in Table 1.16. Because there are no reliable population denominator datafor parity, it is not possible to calculate specic maternalmortality rates. Rates are, however, available for singleton and multiple births, and these are shown in Table 1.17. These show that the increased maternal mortality rate asso-ciated with multiple births in the previous two triennia ismaintained. Women with multiple pregnancies appear tobe four times (95% CI 2.3-6.6) more likely to die of apregnancy-related complication than women expecting onlyone child, but care should be taken in interpreting thisbecause of the very small numbers involved. Assisted reproduction Eight women whose deaths are counted in this Report wereknown to have undergone assisted reproductive techniques(ART), including in vitro fertilisation, for infertility, four of whom died from Direct orIndirect causes, compared with nine in the previous Report. Because it is not possible toseparate UK citizens from visitors from overseas who under- went private in vitro fertilisation treatment, it is not possible to obtain specic denominator data and therefore provide amaternal mortality rate for UK citizens only. Furthermore, itis not possible to calculate an overall mortality rate for ART,because many of the overseas women will have gone back totheir own countries to give birth and are lost to UK followup. But, based on the ndings of earlier Reports where thedata were analysed irrespective of citizenship and place of Table 1.15.

The smallnumbers in this Report suggest that it does not seem to have been the case in this triennium either. Obesity Obesity is dened by a woman's Body Mass Index (BMI). This is calculated by the person's weight in kilogramsdivided by the square of their height in metres (kg/m 2).

In2007, it was estimated that 24% of women in the UK aged16 years or more were obese. 11This is an increase from the 16% calculated for 1993.12 The women who died From the notes available to the Enquiry, the BMI was available for 227 (87%) mothers who died from Direct or Indirect causes. It was not recorded, or was not stated, for 34 women, many of whom died earlier in pregnancy andhad not been booked for maternity care so their BMI hadnot been calculated. In a few other cases, the data weremissing. As shown in Table 1.18, in this Report 47% of mothers who died from Direct causes were either overweight or obese, as were 50% of women who died from Indirect causes. This means that overall, 49% of the women whodied and for whom the BMI was known were either over-weight or obese. When considering obesity alone, that is aBMI of 30 or more, 30% of mothers who died from Direct causes and for whom the BMI was known were obese, aswere 24% of women who died from Indirect causes; 27% overall.In terms of the impact of maternal weight on specic causes of death, it was most signicant for mortality fromthromboembolism, where 78% of the mothers who diedwere overweight or obese. The next group was mothersdying from cardiac disease, of whom 61% were either over- weight or obese. For other causes, the percentage of women dying and who were overweight or obese was around 40%,except for those from suicide, haemorrhage and sepsiswhere the rates were around the national average, that isaround 20-25%. Severe maternal morbidity A national cohort study of the most morbidly obese women (BMI 50 kg/m2or greater) was undertaken through the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS)between September 2007 and August 2008. 13This identi- ed 665 extremely obese women in an estimated 764 387maternities; an estimated prevalence of 87 per 100 000maternities. The women were at risk of a number including pre-eclampsia (adjusted oddsratio 4.46, ratio 7.01, 95% CI 3.56-13.8), and inten- sive-care unit admission (adjusted odds ratio 3.86, 95%CI 1.41-10.6). Obese women were also more likely tohave interventions which put them at risk of severe mor-bidity, including caesarean delivery (adjusted odds ratio3.50, 95% CI 2.72-4.51) and general anaesthesia (adjustedodds ratio 6.35, 95% CI 2.63-15.3). No women in thisstudy died. Impact on pregnancy Obesity in pregnancy, dened as a BMI 30 at booking, was discussed in depth in the last Report. Since then,CMACE and the RCOG have published a joint guidelineon the management of women with obesity in pregnancy, 14 which should be required reading for all maternity orobstetric health professionals.Box 1.5.

Smoking Table 1.19 shows that of the women whose smoking status was known, 65% (148) said that they had never smokedand 28% (64) were current smokers. Six percent (14) said they gave up before pregnancy. This compares with the 14.7% of women smoking in pregnancy identied in theAssociation of Public Health Observatories survey for 2007/08. 15 Vulnerability Ethnicity The ethnic groups of all women who died were reported tothe Enquiry, but the ethnic group of mothers in general isrecorded only in England and not in the other countries of the UK. Since 1995, ethnic group information has beenrecorded in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) Systemfor England, but coverage is still not complete. By thenancial year 2008/09, ethnic group was recorded for 75% of deliveries in England for the years covered by this Report. A comparison of maternity HES data for 2000/01with data about children under the age of 1 year recordedin the 2001 census showed that the ethnic group distribu-tion in HES delivery data was broadly comparable to thecensus population as long as maternities to women whoseethnic group was not stated are grouped with those towomen whose ethnic group was recorded as White. Mater- nity HES data for the nancial years 2006/07, 2007/08 and 2008/09 have been grossed up to the total numbers of reg-istered maternities in England in the 2006/08 triennium toproduce the estimated maternities in Table 1.20. These have been used to produce estimated mortality rates andrelative risks by ethnic group for England. These rates and relative risks are based on small numbers and the coding of ethnicity may be problematic so they should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, analysis of the English data suggests that for Black African women(P< 0.001) and, to a lesser extent Black Caribbean women (P< 0.001), the mortality rate is signicantly higher than that for White women. This may not only reflect the culturalfactors implied in ethnicity but their social circumstancesand the fact that some of them may have recently migratedto the UK under less than optimal circumstances. There have, however, been changes in the mortality rates among certain ethnic groups over time, as Table 1.21 shows. Since the 2000-02 triennium there has been a sig-nicant decline in the maternal mortality rate amongwomen who dene themselves to be of Black African originand of White origin. Time trends for both groups areshown in Figures 1.6 and 1.7. Note that because of small numbers and caution about accurate reporting, these g- ures are not broken down into further subcategories. Overall, 42% of Direct maternal deaths occurred in women of Black and minority ethnic groups and 24% ofIndirect deaths, giving an overall percentage of 31% of women who died of maternal causes declaring themselvesto be from nonWhite ethnic groups. The maternal mortal-ity rate for Direct causes among women from Black and other minority ethnic groups is signicantly different (P< 0.001) when compared with the White ethnic group. However, for deaths from Indirect causes, the difference is not signicantly different ( P= 0.3). Women died from all causes, and there was no relationship between ethnic groupand cause of death. Little or no engagement with maternity services has been a risk factor for maternal deaths for many years. Comparedwith women of White ethnic origin, 11% of whom wereBox 1.6. Risks related to obesity in pregnancy14 For the mother increased risks include: spontaneous rst trimester and recurrent miscarriage maternal death or severe morbidity cardiac disease pre-eclampsia dysfunctional labour gestational diabetes thromboembolism higher chance of needing a caesarean section post-caesarean wound infection postpartum haemorrhage low breastfeeding rates. For the baby increased risks include: stillbirth and neonatal death congenital abnormalities prematurity. References for these are available in the CMACE report14and the last Report of this Enquiry for 2003- 053. Table 1.19.

This is dened as booking after 22 weeks ofgestation or no antenatal care at all. There was no differ-ence, however, for women from Black African origin,implying that they were able to access maternity care morereadily than in the past. Indian women were generally goodattenders for care. The numbers of women in other catego-ries were too small for meaningful analysis. Severe maternal morbidity The impact of ethnicity on the risk of severe maternal mor-bidity was examined in a national cohort study using datacollected by the UKOSS. 16The estimated risk of specic severe maternal morbidities in White women was 80 cases per 100 000 maternities, and that in women from Black orother minority ethnic groups was 126 cases per 100 000(risk ratio 1.58, 95% CI 1.33-1.87). Black African women(188 cases per 100 000 maternities; risk ratio 2.35, 95% CI1.45-3.81) and Black Caribbean women (196 cases per100 000 maternities; risk ratio 2.45, 95% CI 1.81-3.31) hadthe highest risk compared with White women. The risk in Black or other minority ethnic women remained high after adjustment for differences in age, socioeconomic andsmoking status, BMI and parity (odds ratio 1.50, 95% CI1.15-1.96).Table 1.20.

Of the Black Africanwomen, nine were known to be UK citizens. Of the remain-der who were citizens of other countries, most were either recently arrived new immigrants, refugees or asylum seekers. Newly arrived brides Several deaths in Asian women occurred in newly arrived brides who could not speak English. Over the years, thesehave been some of the saddest stories considered by thisEnquiry, and this triennium is no exception, as manyseemed to be very badly treated by their new relatives. Latebooking is common, as is family collusion. This triennium, one young girl was murdered, and another, who died in a re in her new family's house, had all the signs of suicidefollowing a very abusive and violent relationship. Whatshocked the assessors in the latter was the ease with whichthe flimsy explanation for her death was accepted by thosewho cared for her despite evidence to the contrary. Threefurther deaths occurred in women from the Far East whomay have contracted to marry British men, and one was subject to signicant domestic abuse from her husband, who was eventually sent to jail for assault. Healthcare professionals should keep a closer eye on newly arrived brides, especially those who are unable tospeak English and without any family members in the UK.This should particularly be the case if they book late or arepoor attenders for care.020406080100120 2000-02 2003-05 100 000 maternitiesP = 0.003 Figure 1.6.

Thisreflects the experiences of the maternity services in general who report rising numbers of women from the expanded EU, many of whom do not speak English. 'Health tourism' It is not possible to identify, with total accuracy, the num-ber of women who travelled to the UK to give birth, butthere were certainly several women from Africa, mainlyNigeria, who were probably in this category. These are comparable gures to the ve known women in the last Report, also from Africa. Interpretation services Twenty-six women who died from maternal causes,another four who died from Coincidental causes and two who died some months after childbirth spoke little or noEnglish. The minority had had access to interpretation ser- vices, and in other cases family members were used as interpreters. Several of these were the woman's own chil-dren, who may have been the only family members whocould speak English, having learnt it at school. A lack of suitable interpreters is one of the key ndings running throughout this Report. The use of family mem-bers, in some cases very young school-age children of bothsexes, or members of their own, usually tight-knit commu- nity, as interpreters causes concern because: the woman may be too shy to seek help for intimate concerns it is not appropriate for a child to translate intimatedetails about his or her mother and unfair on both thewoman and child it is not clear how much correct information is conveyedto the woman, as the person who is interpreting does not have a good grasp of the language, does not under- stand the specic medical terminology or may withholdinformation some women arrive in the UK late in their pregnancy,and the absence of an interpreter means that a compre-hensive booking history cannot be obtained in some cases, the interpreter is a perpetrator of domes-tic abuse against his partner, so will not enable her to ask for advice or help healthcare staff are unable to pass back their own clinical concerns in an appropriate manner As a woman in the recent Department of Health TaskForce Report against domestic and sexual abuse 17stated, 'even if the perpetrator isn't with you, he sends one of hisfamily members with you. And in the name of honour youcan't ever talk about it. Especially if they say 'I'm going to interpret because she can't speak English''.' Socio-economic classication and employment Since 2001, the National Statistics Socio-Economic Classi- cation (NS SEC)18has been used to classify social class in all ofcial statistics in the UK. Because women's occupationsare missing from so many birth registration records, the NSSEC of the woman's husband or partner derived from hisoccupational code are used in published birth statistics forEngland and Wales. Therefore, to calculate maternal mortal-ity rates by NS SEC, the women's husbands' or partners'occupations, where available, were used, irrespective of whether the women's occupations were recorded. As num- bers were small, the three-class version of NS SEC was used.Single mothers are identied as having no partner. Table 1.22 shows that women with husbands or partners who were unemployed or unclassied, were the most vulner-able, were nearly six times more likely ( P< 0.001) to die than women with husbands or partners who are employed.For women with partners in routine or intermediate occupa- tions compared with women with partners in managerial and professional groups, the risk is increased two-fold. Todate it is not possible to calculate rates for single mothersbecause these data are not routinely collected. Figure 1.8 shows how this compares with the last two triennia. It is important to note that data for 2000-02 werecalculated according to the coding systems at the time andare not directly comparable, but it provides an idea of the apparently positive general trend. Area deprivation scores As with the last Report, maternal deaths that occurred to residents of England have been analysed using the EnglishIndices of Multiple Deprivation 2004. 19The results are shown in Table 1.23 and graphically in Figure 1.9. This shows that there is evidence of a signicant decrease (P= 0.01) in the rates for the more deprived groups com- pared with the last Report. Domestic abuse During the years 2006-08, 39 (12%) of all the womenknown to this Enquiry, and who died of any cause, hadfeatures of domestic abuse. For eight of these women,murdered by their husband or partner, the abuse was fatal. Three other women were murdered by non-family mem- bers. Many of the other women, who died from a range ofother causes, had proactively self-reported domestic abuseto a healthcare professional either before or during theirpregnancy. Overall, 38% of these mothers were poorattenders or late bookers for antenatal care, which is animprovement from the 56% reported in the last Report.Lewis 50 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203Mothers who themselves were subject to sexual abuse in childhood In a recent report from the Violence against Women and Children Task Force, 21% of girls under 16 years experiencesexual abuse during childhood. 17It is also estimated that across the UK there are upwards of ve million adultwomen who experienced some form of sexual abuse duringchildhood. 17While assessing all of the cases available to this Report, 17 mothers were identied who had declared that they had been sexually abused by a relative, usually theirfather, as a girl. Most of these women had chaotic or vul-nerable lifestyles, and three were prostitutes. Seven of themdied of Direct and Indirect causes, and the others generally died from later suicides or overdoses of drugs of addiction.Child protection issues Sixty-two of the women whose deaths were reviewed thistriennium were known to social services and/or child pro-tection services, the vast majority of whom had previouschildren in care. Between them, the mothers who died had70 children in care, in two cases the numbers being sevensiblings or higher. Thirty-four of these women died fromcomplications related to their pregnancy, that is from Direct orIndirect conditions. As shown in Table 1.24, 28% of the women who died from Direct orIndirect causes and who were known to the child protection services did not seek care at all, bookedlate or failed to maintain regular contact with the mater-nity services.

Substance misuse Fifty-three of all the women whose deaths were assessed this triennium, including from Coincidental and Latecauses, had problems with substance misuse. Of these, 31 were known drug addicts, 16 were noted to be occasional users and an additional six women were solely alcoholdependent. Ten women were both drug and alcohol depen-dent.

However, for those who did, there was increasing evi- dence of a greater emphasis on planned multidisciplinary and multi-agency care, and in some cases the care theyreceived was outstanding. Issues relating to substance mis-use and pregnancy are discussed in Chapter 11. Risk factors and barriers to care Many of the women who died found it difcult to seek, orto maintain contact with, maternity and/or other health services. The many possible reasons for this have been dis- cussed throughout this Chapter, and the main characteris-tics of the women who found it difcult to attend aresummarised in Table 1.26. As many, if not all, of these risk factors interplay with each other, it is hoped that a morerobust multivariate analysis will be undertaken in futurereports.From the ndings of this triennial Report there appears to have been a considerable improvement in women accessing and staying in touch with maternity services com-pared with the last Report, where 81% of women who haddeclared domestic abuse or who were known to the childprotection or social services were poor attenders, comparedwith 32 and 39%, respectively for this Report. Similarly,78% of known substance abusers did not have appropriatecare in the last Report, compared with 44% for this Report. Improving access to care for the most disadvantaged or vulnerable women has long been a recommendation ofthese Reports. It is therefore heartening to see this issueaddressed in the latest guideline from the National Institutefor Health and Clinical Excellence on providing models ofmaternity service provision for pregnant women with com-plex social factors. 20Table 1.24.

As part of completing the report forms for this Enquiry, all healthcare workers are asked to reflect on what went welland not so well and to describe what they learnt from thecase and if it has changed their practice. Although manyhealth professionals wrote in humbling terms, othersshowed a complete lack of understanding of what had gonewrong or were complacent in the extreme. This is an underlying reason why one of the Key Recommendations, to develop and undertake and act on the results of farmore robust serious incident/serious untoward incidentreviews, is so necessary. A few healthcare workers blamed themselves when clearly there was no reason for this, demonstrating theeffects that these generally unexpected and sudden deathsin young women can have on those who care for them, as well as on her baby, other children, family and wider com- munity. It is important that all staff, as well as familymembers, who are affected by a maternal death, be offeredsupport and counselling. Discussion and conclusions Compared with the recent Reports, the ndings for this Enquiry show a generally encouraging picture, which con- tinues to demonstrate the value of this work. The resultsshow not only welcome reductions in deaths from someclinical causes, especially thromboembolism, but also adeclining trend in the inequalities gap between well-off and more deprived women. This public health aspect is one of the key strengths of this Report. The ndings suggest thatmany of the previous lessons have been heeded and actionhas been taken on their recommendations. Certainly, mid-wives and other professionals from all around the countryhave been actively engaged in many CMACE and otherlocal training meetings based on the ndings and represen-tative cases contained in the last Report. The Department of Health in England also built the earlier recommenda- tions relating to easier access to care for the most vulnera-ble women, and early booking, into their policy formaternity services, Maternity Matters . 5Finally, although we are unable to test this association statistically, it is difcultto ignore the apparent relationship between the signicantdecline in deaths from pulmonary embolism, and to a les-ser degree, haemorrhage, and the publication and imple- mentation of guidelines for these which have been recommended in previous Reports. There were setbacks, however, particularly in the rise in deaths from community-acquired infections, although thishas occurred at a time when the background populationmortality rate had also increased. This was before theH1N1 pandemic. It is hoped that the strengthened recom-mendations made in this Report for national and local guidelines for the identication and management of sepsis, and accompanying health information for mothers andfamilies, are implemented without delay. A recommenda-tion for such a national guideline was made in the lastTable 1.26.

These relate to themanagement of systolic hypertension, the mismanagementof which again features in this Report, and to improvingthe quality of Critical Incident or Sudden Unexpected Inci- dent reviews. One of the major themes identied by all of the assessors, whatever the cause of death, was the highlyvariable nature of these reports, and urgent action isrequired to produce a national minimum standard for suchcrucial opportunities for review, self-reflective learning andpersonal and institutional change. Attention also needs tobe paid to other areas where there is room for developingeven better maternity services. These include pregnancy planning, preconception care and improving the care of vulnerable pregnant women and for those with complexmedical, social or mental health needs. Overall, however, the ndings of this Report are reassur- ing, as the overall decline in the maternal mortality ratehas taken place against a background of an increasing birthrate, sometimes stretched maternity services and a generallyolder and less healthy population of mothers. Compared with the general pregnant population, the women who died tended to be older and more obese, had lifestyles whichput them at risk of poorer health and were more sociallydisadvantaged. And, as also shown in the last Report, thereappeared to be a growing proportion of mothers with moremedically complex pregnancies. Other developed countriesare facing similar problems, and in some, for example theUSA, the maternal mortality rate appears to have doubled. 2 Maternal deaths are extremely rare in the UK, unlike many other parts of the world.21,22Internationally, the work of this Report continues to be held up as the 'GoldStandard' for maternal death audits and reviews, and itsmethodology is much in demand in developing and devel-oped countries, ranging from the poorest African states tothe USA and Japan. This has been accelerated by a renewedglobal emphasis by the United Nations and others on reducing the 358 000 mainly avoidable maternal deaths, 2 four million neonatal deaths23and over three million still- births24each year. These over seven million deaths are lar- gely the result of preventable or treatable maternalconditions. This renewed effort is in response to the woefullack of progress in relation to the Millennium DevelopmentGoal 5 relating to maternal mortality (MDG 5), 25,26where countries have pledged to reduce their maternal mortality rate by 75% by 2015. As a result, many of the resource- poor countries with very high mortality rates are startingto assess the numbers and causes of their maternal deaths,and CMACE and the Saving Mothers' Lives Director, authors and assessors are providing help and support. Theresults of these reviews are to identify remediable factorsand missed opportunities to form the basis for national orlocal guidelines and recommendations for benecialchanges to the health, maternity and neonatal services over- all, as well as clinical practice. 27,28 There is a danger that the comparatively small numbers of maternal deaths in the UK will lead to complacency, butthere is always more to be done to improve maternal and child health. As this Report has shown, new issues continue to arise, and the next Report for 2009-11 will also cover theH1N1 pandemic. The fact that a health alert concerning theprevention and earlier detection of community-acquiredGroup A streptococcal sepsis was issued before publicationof the main report shows the importance of this work to theprotection of pregnant or newly delivered mothers and thewider public health. The signicant decline in deaths from thrombosis highlights the clinical benets of this Enquiry. The reduction in inequalities demonstrates that the earlierrecommendations for changes to the way services are deliv-ered to the more vulnerable and excluded women may havehad an impact. Overall, these results continue to demon-strate what a force this Enquiry is for the continuingimprovement of maternal and child health. Disclosure of interests None.

New guidance on the management of women with obesity in pregnancy has been published by Centre for Maternal and Child Enquries (CMACE) and the RoyalCollege of weight-specic dosage advice thromboprophylaxis is now included in the revised RCOG guideline.2These should be widely disseminated and implemented. Risk assessment in early pregnancy continues to be a key factor in reducing mortality. Obese women with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more are unsuitable for midwife-only care, and should be seen in pregnancy by a consul-tant obstetrician. Women are at risk of thromboembolism from the very beginning of pregnancy until the end of the puerperium, and allhealth professionals must be aware of this. Early pregnancy units and gynaecology wards must carry out risk assessmentappropriate for pregnant women. Vulnerable women, such as those with mental illness or learning disability, may not be able to follow advice or self- administer injections, and so require particular care.

Summary of key ndings for 2006-08 The deaths of 18 women who died from thrombosis and/orthromboembolism are counted in this chapter. This gives amaternal mortality rate of 0.79 per 100 000 maternities(95% CI 0.49-1.25). Sixteen of the 18 deaths were attrib-uted to pulmonary embolism and two to cerebral veinthrombosis. Additionally, four Late deaths attributed to pul- monary embolism are counted in Chapter 12, but the les- sons to be learnt from these cases are discussed here. These 18 deaths represent a sharp, and statistically signif- icant, fall from 41 deaths in 2003-05 and, as shown in Table 2.1 and Figure 2.1, this total is by far the lowest since the UK-wide Enquiry began in 1985. The fall in deathsfrom pulmonary embolism, from 33 to 16, was mainly theresult of a reduction in antenatal deaths and deaths follow- ing vaginal delivery. Deaths after caesarean section also fell slightly. This is the rst full triennium following publica-tion of the 2004 RCOG guideline Thromboprophylaxis dur- ing pregnancy, labour and after normal vaginal delivery . 3Itseems likely that the unprecedented fall in deaths is the result of better recognition of at-risk women and more widespread thromboprophylaxis. Nevertheless, risk factors for thromboembolism were present in 16 of the 18 women who died in 2006-08. Obes-ity remains the most important of these. Fourteen womenwere overweight (BMI 25 kg/m 2), of whom 11 had a BMI30, including three who had a BMI 40. All the deaths occurred before the publication in 2009 of the updated guideline2, which now includes more extensive weight-specic dosage advice on thromboprophylaxis. Substandard care was present in 56% of women. This took the form of inadequate risk assessment, inadequate throm-boprophylaxis (by the standards at the time), failure toinvestigate chest symptoms in at-risk women, and failure toensure multidisciplinary care involving a consultant obstetri-cian or a psychiatrist for women who also had a pre-existing medical or mental health illness that affected their treatment. For the rst time since the UK-wide Enquiry began in 1985, thromboembolism is no longer the leading cause ofChapter 2: Thrombosis and thromboembolism \u00aa2011 Centre BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 57Direct death. Nonetheless, there is ample scope for a fur- ther reduction in deaths by careful adherence to the new guidelines and prompt investigation of new chest symp-toms in at-risk women. Cases counted in other Chapters Apart from the four Late deaths counted in Chapter 12, pulmonary embolism also contributed to two deaths fromother causes, which are counted and discussed elsewhere. One, in a woman who died of tuberculosis that had not been identied although she was at high risk and had allthe symptoms, is counted and discussed in Chapter 10,Indirect deaths. Another woman, whose death from sepsis is counted in Chapter 7, also had a pulmonary embolism,although it was not the underlying cause of death. Maternal morbidity from antenatal pulmonary embolism Signicant morbidity from pulmonary embolism underlies the deaths reported in this chapter. A prospective nationalcase-control study of antenatal pulmonary embolism undertaken through the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) between February 2005 and August 2006reported an incidence of 12.6 cases per 100 000 maternities(95% CI 10.6-14.9 per 100 000 maternities). 4Of the women who had an antenatal pulmonary embolism, 3.5%died, which is similar to the ndings for this Report. Nota-bly, only 70% of women had an identiable risk factor forthromboembolic disease and only 18% had two or more identiable risk factors; the main risk factors identied were 6.45). The United Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System,UKOSS, is described in detail in the Introduction Chapterof this Report. Pulmonary embolism As shown in Table 2.2, of the 16 deaths from pulmonary embolism, three occurred during the rst trimester of preg-Table 2.1.

There were also two deaths that occurred after mis- carriage. There were three deaths in the third trimester, allof which involved perimortem caesarean section. Therewere no deaths after ectopic pregnancy and no deaths dur-ing labour. There were eight postpartum deaths, two aftervaginal delivery and six after caesarean section. The women who died Risk factors for thromboembolism were identiable in 14of the 16 women, 12 of whom were overweight or obese.Five women had learning disabilities or psychiatric prob-lems, which led to lack of compliance or poor attendancefor care. Five of the six women from minority ethnicgroups were of Black African or Caribbean origin, of whomtwo did not speak English. Three women had excessive vomiting in pregnancy, and two died after prolonged immobility. The updated RCOG guideline 2lists hypereme- sis as a risk factor for thrombosis. Well-known risk factors such as a past history, or fam- ily history, of thromboembolism were conspicuous bytheir absence. There were no women in whom assistedconception was a causative factor in this triennium, andno woman died after long-distance travel. All of these have been identied as risk factors in previous Reports: their absence in 2006-08 does not mean that they are nolonger important, but does suggest that at-risk womenmay now be being identied and offered appropriateadvice. Seven of the 16 women reported chest symptoms to a doctor or midwife in the weeks before they died. Thesesymptoms were variously recorded as cough, chest pain or breathlessness, and clinical examination was negative in all women. Chest symptoms are often vague and non-specic,but when new symptoms are reported in pregnancy or thepuerperium there should be a low threshold for investiga-tion, particularly when other risk factors such as obesity are present. Risk factors Weight The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline on antenatal care recommends that every woman should have her BMI checked at the rst antenatalvisit and that those women with a BMI 35 are not suit- able for routine midwife-led care. 5This recommendation has generally been followed. For the rst time since 1985there are no cases counted in this Chapter in which thewoman's BMI was unknown, although for some womenthere was doubt about whether it had been calculated cor- rectly. Care is required with this calculation to ensure that the woman's risk is accurately assessed. Appropriate referralwas made in almost all cases, though not all womenattended their referral appointment. Nevertheless weight remains the most important risk fac- tor identied in these deaths. Of the 16 women who died,three were overweight with a BMI 25 and nine were clas- sied as obese with a BMI 30, including one who had a BMI > 40. Also, two of the women who suffered a Late Direct death, and the two women who died of cerebral vein thrombosis had a BMI 35. Overall, three women with a BMI40 died; this is less than the total of six in the last Report, but could be reduced further. After the end of the 2006-08 triennium, two new guide- lines were published, one on the management of womenwith obesity in pregnancy 1and the other a revised guide- line on thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy and the puerpe- rium.2Previous Reports had called for such guidance and for weight-specic dosage advice regarding thrombopro-phylaxis, and this is now available.

This was also reflected in the UKOSS study ofantenatal pulmonary embolism. 4The new guidance should further reduce deaths. Age The ages of the women ranged between 20 and 39 yearswith a mean of 30 years. Three of the six women who diedafter caesarean section were aged under 25. The age distri-bution of deaths from pulmonary embolism in the UKfrom 1985 to 2008 is shown in Table 2.3. Before 1991 the risk increased sharply after the age of 40 but this increase was no longer seen from 1997. The change may be the result of better recognition of at-risk women and appropri-ate thromboprophylaxis. In other age groups, there is asmall but consistent increase in risk with increasing age. Ethnicity Six of the 16 women were from minority ethnic groups,ve being Black African or Caribbean. Three of the ve antenatal deaths were in Black African or Caribbean women, all of whom died in the rst trimester. All fourLate Direct deaths were in Caucasian women. Family history None of the 16 women had a clear family history of thromboembolism. This does not mean that family historyis no longer a risk factor, but it suggests that this risk fac- tor is being recognised and women are being offered thromboprophylaxis. A family history was present in oneof the Late deaths.Previous history None of the women who died had a previous history of thromboembolism. This risk factor has also been high-lighted in previous reports and its absence from the casesin this triennium again suggest s that appropriate thrombopro- phylaxis is being offered to women with a previous history. Immobility One woman had been admitted to hospital with hypereme- sis gravidarum and died despite receiving appropriatethromboprophylaxis. Another was hospitalised and was vir-tually immobilised from a signicant illness and did notreceive thromboprophylaxis. Both the updated RCOG Green Top guideline 2and the NICE guideline for thrombo- prophylaxis for women admitted to hospital6stress the importance of immobility as a risk factor. Psychiatric illness and learning disability Five women had learning disabilities or a history of psychi-atric disorder, which then recurred, and four of themreceived substandard care. It is clear that the services link- ing maternity and psychiatric services may not be well planned in some areas. Two of the Late deaths were in women who had psychiatric disorders. The cases are alsodiscussed in Chapter 11: Psychiatric causes of death , which draws attention to the fact that antipsychotic medicationmay be associated with weight gain, which may put thewoman at increased risk of thromboembolism. Gynaecological conditions Two women had uterine broids that were known aboutbefore pregnancy, one of whom underwent laparotomy for Table 2.3.

Assisted conception was not relevant to any of the deaths in this triennium,though one woman who died during pregnancy had con-ceived after intrauterine insemination. Chest symptoms Seven of the 16 women reported chest symptoms to a doc-tor or midwife in the weeks before they died. Two of thethree women who were Late deaths had also reported chest symptoms. Antepartum deaths Of the six women who had a pulmonary embolism in their antenatal period, three died in the rst trimester (up to and including 12 weeks of gestation) and three died afterperimortem caesarean section in the third trimester. Onlyone of these six women collapsed without prior warning;the other ve complained of respiratory symptoms, one tothe Emergency Department and four to their GPs. Two ofthe three women who died in the rst trimester were obese,and all three were Black African or Caribbean. The learning points from these deaths can be summar- ised as: 1Booking, with its formal risk assessment, often takes place late in the rst trimester. Before that time,women are vulnerable. 2Dehydration is associated with increased risk of embo- lism, and hydration levels of women who are complain-ing of vomiting should be assessed. 3Chest symptoms arising for the rst time in pregnancy in an at-risk woman require investigation. 4There is still insufcient awareness that women, partic- ularly obese women, are at risk from thromboembolismin early pregnancy. 5The obstetric team should see pregnant women with chest pain. In some cases women were referred forassessment to the medical team, who were unaware of, or underestimated, the risks of embolism in pregnancy. 6Tachycardia is a critically important nding when a preg- nant woman presents with a new symptom of breathless-ness, though it is not diagnostic of pulmonary embolism(and nor does its absence rule out the diagnosis). 7Gynaecological wards should have a risk assessment form specically for women in early pregnancy, and itmust be completed. The following is a typical example: An obese woman with a history of chest pains before preg- nancy saw her GP early in her pregnancy and thereafterhad contact on several occasions by phone and in person, complaining about chest pain or shortness of breath. She also developed hyperemesis and was eventually admitted tohospital where tachycardia was noted. Investigation forthromboembolism was commenced, but she collapsed and died before treatment was initiated. When reviewing these cases the assessors took into account how difcult it is to decide whether commonsymptoms are trivial or important. For example: An obese mother consulted her GP in the third trimester with shortness of breath. No abnormality was found onclinical examination, and she was treated with an inhaler.Shortly afterwards she collapsed and died. The assessors felt that care was not substandard for this woman, but the practice itself held a rigorous enquiry andidentied several areas for possible improvement. Top oftheir list was the need to document the pulse rate. Thislocal enquiry is an example of good practice, which shouldbe more widely followed. Deaths after miscarriage or termination of preg- nancy Two women died after miscarriage, the underlying cause of which, in one woman, should have meant that thrombo-prophylaxis should have been considered. Intrapartum deaths There were no intrapartum deaths in this triennium. Deaths after vaginal delivery Two women died after vaginal delivery, both after the thirdweek of their puerperium, and there were also two Late deaths. Three of these four women had mental healthproblems and found it difcult to stay in touch with boththe maternity and psychiatric services, although they wereavailable to them. In two women care was substandard. All the cases demonstrate that there may be a long interval between delivery and death. The major lessons to be learntfrom this group of deaths are as follows. 1Action should be taken when an obese woman reports the new onset of breathlessness. 2Hospital guidelines on thromboprophylaxis should give specic advice about women. The updatedRCOG guideline 2and the CMACE/RCOG obesity guideline1both recommend that women with a BMI 40 should be considered for postnatal thromboprophy-laxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)regardless of the mode of delivery or the presence ofother risk factors. 3Psychiatric involvement is required when a woman has a history of previous postnatal mental health problemsand there is renewed concern about her mental health. The following is a typical example: A morbidly obese woman with a probable learning disabil- ity was a poor attender for antenatal care. Some weeks afterChapter 2: Thrombosis and 1), 1-203 61delivery she became breathless and called her midwife, who advised her to see her GP or go to the Emergency Depart-ment if her breathlessness did not improve. She did not doso and a few days later she collapsed and died. In contrast to the general practice enquiry mentioned above, the assessors noted that hospital internal enquiriesoften focus only on acts or omissions by their own staffand make no recommendations about how to help vulnera-ble women. The assessors are concerned that hospital Seri- ous Untoward Incident (SUI) reports they reviewed varied greatly in quality. A national audit of such serious incidentreports is recommended. Deaths after caesarean section Six women died after caesarean section; the three womenwhose antepartum collapse was followed by perimortemcaesarean section have been considered separately. They all died between 2 and 6 weeks after delivery. In addition, two women died more than 42 days after caesarean section andare classied as Late deaths. Four of the six women were obese (BMI 30), including one who had a BMI 40. Five of the six received LMWH; the remaining woman refused LMWH because of needlephobia. One woman had an underlying medical disease,which was the indication for caesarean section, but she died from pulmonary embolism. In one case it was unclear whether an obese woman had symptoms before collapsingin the late puerperium. Care was judged to be substandardfor four women. The lessons to be learned from these cases are: 1Women at risk of thromboembolism should be encour- aged to report new chest symptoms after delivery. 2Investigation is required when a woman with risk fac- tors has new chest symptoms. 3Miscalculation of the BMI at home booking can have serious consequences. It can lead to an inappropriatelack of obstetric input into antenatal care, misclassica-tion of the woman as being at moderate rather thanhigh risk of pulmonary embolism and inadequatethromboprophylaxis. The following is a typical example: An obese woman was booked for midwife-led care and referred to a consultant obstetrician after term. Labour wasinduced, but caesarean section was required for fetal dis- tress. Thromboprophylaxis consisted of Flowtron boots and anti-embolism stockings: LMWH was started 7 hours afterdelivery and continued for 4 days. Five weeks after deliveryshe saw her GP with 'chest infection and pain' and wasgiven antibiotics. She died a few days later. According tothe autopsy, pulmonary embolism had been present for sev-eral days death.The updated RCOG guidance 2recommends postnatal thromboprophylaxis with LMWH to be continued for1 week and longer if there are ongoing risk factors. The useof properly applied graduated compression stockings ofappropriate strength is recommended in pregnancy and the puerperium for those who are hospitalised after caesarean section (combined with LMWH) and considered to be atparticularly high risk for venous thromboembolism [VTE](such as previous venous thromboembolism or more thanthree risk factors). Late deaths Four Late Direct deaths related directly to pulmonary embolism are counted in Chapter 12. Three occurred 7 weeks after delivery and one much later in her postnatalyear. All the women were Caucasian; two had vaginal deliv-eries and two were delivered by caesarean section. Twowomen had normal body weight and no risk factors exceptthat one had a psychiatric disorder. Both these womenreceived good care including appropriate referral andthromboprophylaxis. Both the other two women were obese and received substandard care. An older woman with a psychiatric disorder and social problems had a family history of thromboembolism. Afterdelivery she was discharged home on 'self-administered Clexane', but lacked the skills to give herself these injections. Four weeks after delivery she attended the EmergencyDepartment with calf pain and breathlessness. She wasgiven an injection of LMWH and asked to come back nextday. Two weeks later she returned with a history of pleuriticpain, developed severe breathlessness and died. The treatment given took no account of her background, risk factors and high likelihood of not returning whenasked. The RCOG guideline on acute management ofthromboembolic disease in pregnancy and the puerperiumrecommends that any woman with signs and symptoms suggestive of VTE should have objective testing performed expeditiously and treatment with LMWH until the diagno-sis is excluded. The therapeutic dose of LMWH should beweight-related 7as shown in Table 2.4. Cerebral vein thrombosis There were two deaths from likely cerebral vein thrombo- sis, though the diagnosis was not straightforward in either woman. Both women were morbidly obese and both pre-sented with headache and neurological symptoms afterdelivery at term. They also both had previous medical com-plications that could have caused dehydration. A woman who may have had a co-existent encephalopathy developed vomiting and dizziness near term, which persistedDrife 62 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203after delivery. She then developed a headache and subse- quently was unable to walk but, as no medical cause forher symptoms was found, she was transferred to psychiatriccare. When her consciousness level deteriorated she wasreviewed by a neurologist; a computed tomography scan suggested internal cerebral vein thrombosis. The post-mor- tem report gave the cause of death as bronchopneumonia inassociation with encephalopathy. Vomiting in the third trimester is not normal and should be investigated thoroughly. It is also important to ensure review by senior doctors with experience of manag-ing complex disorders in pregnancy. Women with pro-tracted vomiting should be given thiamine because of therecognised risk of Wernicke's encephalopathy. In the other woman, although her BMI was >50, there were no other risk factors and, at the time, morbid obesitywas not by itself an indication for thromboprophylaxis with LMWH. The previous Report commented that risk factors for cerebral vein thrombosis appeared to be the same as forpulmonary thrombosis, and expressed the hope that'increasing application of thromboprophylaxis among at-risk women will reduce deaths from both forms of throm-boembolism'. 8The total of two deaths in the present Report, compared with eight in 2003-05, gives cause for optimism that this is happening and that deaths from cere- bral vein thrombosis may be further reduced by therecently published guidelines. 1,2 Substandard care overall Care was judged to be substandard in ten of the 18 cases ofthromboembolism (56%). In seven women there was inade- quate thromboprophylaxis according to the standards at the time, and in six there was a failure to investigate chestsymptoms in at-risk women, even, in some instances, after repeated presentation. Five cases involved a failure of appro-priate referral to a consultant obstetrician or psychiatrist.Compared with the previous report, however, there werefew instances of unnecessary delay in treatment and few cases in which known risks were ignored. Care was judged on the standards applicable at the time, and one reason for the large number of womenreceiving inadequate thromboprophylaxis may have been alack of clarity in the existing guidelines. It is to be hopedthat the revised guidelines will remedy this, and thatclearer advice will result in more appropriate thrombopro-phylaxis. Women with chest symptoms are likely to report these to GPs or hospital Emergency Departments, and everyeffort must be made to alert these groups of doctors to thesignicance of such symptoms in pregnant women withother risk factors. 'An accurate diagnosis of PE and timelyintervention are crucial.' 9 Concern has been expressed about the variable quality of hospital critical incident or SUI reports, and the comments of the last Report are worth repeating here. 'With the introduction of clinical governance and critical incidentreporting in hospitals, it might be expected that the identi-cation of substandard care by national reports like thisone would become less necessary. To date, this is not thecase. Although we have evidence that in many cases localclinicians have reflected with insight on the cases in thischapter, we have also noted in a few cases that lessons which seem obvious to national assessors have not been learned at local level'. 8This chapter has highlighted an example of good practice, but there are others in whichmuch effort has been expended on serious incident/SUIreports to little obvious effect. A national audit of this pro-cess may provide useful guidance.Table 2.4.

Four of the 14 are considered in other chapters,because the death was primarily the result of another co-morbidity; for example sepsis, tumour bulk and Late Coin- cidental causes. Associated predisposing causes were also often present in those classied as Direct deaths from embolus. Signicant obesity with a BMI of 35 was present in ve women, and one of these also had a family history of thrombophilia from Protein S deciency. In one woman there was preceding signicant, though not otherwise life-threatening, inflammation of the genital tract. These raisethe question of where the dividing line between Direct , Indirect and Coincidental should be drawn for this group and whether all pulmonary embolic deaths should bereclassied as Indirect . The leg and pelvic veins were not examined/mentioned in any of the six poor reports. One of these was a Late Coincidental death of a woman on antipsychotic drugs. These have been associated with deep vein thrombosis.Given that there is a greater propensity for pregnancy tobe associated with pelvic vein than deep leg vein throm-bosis, the site and location of the emboli is useful infor-mation to be derived from the autopsy if not otherwiseknown and in this case may have suggested reclassication to being from Late Direct causes. In three women, there was retrospectively a clear preceding clinical history ofdyspnoea, but in only one of these was there any attemptto search for previous embolic episodes; in the other twothere was not even any histology taken. This is particu-larly surprising in one woman, who had an enlarged anddilated right heart, but the cause was not investigated. Such examples contrast starkly with, for instance, some deaths in the rst trimester. In one, breathlessness had been attributed to asthma. As well as identifying the pulmonaryemboli, histology conrmed that several were organisedand quite possibly preceded pregnancy and, furthermore,that the features of asthma were not present. In another,emboli complicated dehydration caused by hyperemesis:the mammillary bodies were macroscopically and micro-scopically normal. Thromboembolism pathology: good practice points Examine and describe the pelvic and deep leg veins. Identify contributory co-morbid factors. Correlate the ndings and histology with the clinical history.Conclusions For many years these Reports have been suggesting thatmost deaths from thromboembolism are preventable. There is now evidence to support this. The 1995 RCOG guideline on thromboprophylaxis after caesarean section 10was fol- lowed by a sharp fall in deaths in this category, and nowthe 2004 RCOG guideline 3has been followed by a sharp fall in antenatal deaths and deaths following vaginal deliv-ery, and, perhaps unexpectedly, in deaths from cerebralvein thrombosis. The detailed advice in the 2009 revisedguideline 2should produce further improvement. Guidelines, however, are effective only when there is a widespread awareness of the risks and of the need to applythe advice. The cases reported here demonstrate that mostdeaths from thromboembolism occur in women withknown risk factors. This re-emphasises the need for carefulrisk assessment as early as possible in pregnancy andcontinuing reassessment of risk during and after pregnancy.When an at-risk woman is identied, it is not enough merely to give advice or make a referral. Some continuity is needed to check that she has been able to follow theadvice or attend the appointment. Symptoms must be interpreted in the light of the woman's background risk factors. This ought to be a state-ment of the obvious, but several cases show that this doesnot always happen. A distressing feature of this chapter isthe over-representation of vulnerable women. The many pressures on the maternity services are no excuse for pro- viding substandard service to women who require care inthe true sense of the word. Disclosure of interests None.

Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia: specic recommendations Pregnant women with a headache of sufcient severity to seek medical advice, or with new epigastric pain, should have their blood pressure measured and urine tested for protein, as a minimum. Epigastric pain in the second half ofpregnancy should be considered to be the result of pre-eclampsia until proven otherwise. Any discussion between clinical staff about a woman with pre-eclampsia should include explicit mention of the systolic pressure. Severe, life-threatening, hypertension must be treated effectively. Management protocols should recognise the need to avoid very high systolic blood pressures which are associated with an increased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage. Systolic blood pressures of 150 mmHg, or above, require effective antihypertensive treatment. If the systolic pressure is very high, >180 mmHg, this is a medical emergency that requires urgent as well as effective antihypertensive treatment. Intramuscular oxytocin, not Syntometrine, should be the routine drug for active management of the third stage oflabour. Women with severe pre-eclampsia need effective team care, based on clear communication and common under-standing. There should be early engagement of intensive care specialists where appropriate. Efforts must be made tore-engage and re-skill GPs who see women with complications during pregnancy. Women who elect to pay for pri- vate obstetric care are entitled to as good a standard of care as they would receive in the NHS. Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia: learning points Eclampsia is important because it is a marker for severe disease, but seizures also carry additional intrinsic risks. Some automated blood pressure monitoring systems sys-tematically underestimate systolic pressure in pre-eclampsia. Summary of ndings for 2006-08 Overall, the deaths of 22 women are counted and discussed in this Chapter. Nineteen were the result of eclampsia orpre-eclampsia and three were the result of acute fatty liverof pregnancy (AFLP), the values are shown in Table 3.1. In terms of deaths from eclampsia or pre-eclampsia the mortality rate for this triennium was 0.83 per 100 000maternities (95% CI 0.53-1.30) compared with 0.66 (0.39- 1.12) in the last Report. The three deaths from AFLP are included in this Chapter on the basis that this may be part of a spectrum of condi-tions related to pre-eclampsia. 1In one of these AFLP was an unexpected histopathological nding at autopsy in awoman with the clinical syndrome of pre-eclampsia andwho died because of massive intra-abdominal haemorrhage.There was only one such case in the last Report. Fourteen of the 22 women died from cerebral causes; nine from intracranial haemorrhage and ve from anoxiafollowing cardiac arrest in association with eclamptic sei-zures. Of the other causes of death, three women died fromliver complications (two from necrosis and one from sub-capsular haemorrhage), two died from multi-organ failurein intensive care units, two from complications of AFLPand one from intra-abdominal haemorrhage of uncertainNeilson 66 Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203source. There were no deaths from simple fluid overload. The causes of death are compared with values from recenttriennia in Table 3.1. Severe maternal morbidity A national study of eclampsia conducted through the UKObstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) (The United King-dom Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) is described inmore detail in the Introduction Chapter of this Report.)between February 2005 and February 2006 identied 214cases, 2giving an estimated incidence of 27.5 cases per 100 000 maternities (95% CI 23.9-31.4 per 100 000 materni-ties). This is almost a halving of the incidence of eclampsia since 1992. 3The decrease in incidence has occurred almost entirely in the group of women with diagnosed pre-eclamp-sia. No women died in the UKOSS study, but eclampsia wasassociated with signicant additional maternal morbidity,including cerebrovascular events, in ve women (2.3%).Combining the UKOSS data and the data from this Report,the case fatality rate from eclampsia is estimated to be 3.1%. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy Surveillance of AFLP through UKOSS between February2005 and August 2006 identied 57 women with AFLP inan estimated 1 132 964 maternities; 1an estimated incidence of 5.0 cases per 100 000 maternities (95% CI 3.8-6.5 per100 000 maternities). Only one died (casefatality rate 1.8%, 95% CI 0-9.4%), but 60% were admitted to a Critical Care unit. Eighteen percent of the women withAFLP had twin pregnancies. The women who died Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia The ages of the women who died from pre-eclampsia/eclampsia ranged between 19 and 39 years with a medianage of 31 years. Their gestations ranged from 21 to41 weeks. It is sometimes said that pre-eclampsia at term is a benign condition. This is not necessarily so. Early-onsetpre-eclampsia is, overall, a more aggressive condition than late-onset disease, but fulminating, ultimately fatal, pre- eclampsia also occurs at term. Four of the women were at,or after, 40 weeks of gestation. Parity ranged from 0 to 9; thirteen women were primigr- avid. Four women had twin pregnancies. Seven women hadeclamptic ts. There was evidence of HELLP (haemolysis,elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count) syndrome ineight women. The body mass index (BMI) ranged between 20 and 43 with a median of 24. Most women were not obese, but ve had BMIs 30, including one BMI 40. Ten of the women who died from pre-eclampsia/eclampsia werewhite, and, of the remaining nine, six were Black Africans.Black African women seem particularly susceptible toaggressive forms of pre-eclampsia. To establish if this isTable 3.1.

Acute fatty liver of pregnancy The ages of the women who died from AFLP rangedbetween 23 and 39 years with a median of 33 years. Onehad a BMI >40. None were from minority ethnic groups. Substandard care Disappointingly, 20 of the 22 cases demonstrated substan-dard care; in 14 cases this was classed as 'major', and therewere, undoubtedly, avoidable deaths. Deaths from intracra- nial haemorrhage, the single largest cause of death, indicate a failure of effective antihypertensive therapy. Ensuringeffective antihypertensive therapy is the priority forimproving clinical care for these women. This has been em-phasised in recent Reports and is yet again one of the 'Topten' recommendations in this Report. Substandard care occurred both in hospitals and in the community. There were four women in whom GPs made errors. These were mainly around failure to refer appropri- ately to specialist services, often because of a failure toappreciate the signicance of symptoms or signs of pre-eclampsia. In one woman, a GP started outpatient antihy-pertensive drug treatment in a woman with pre-eclampsia,instead of referring her for specialist care. Another referreda woman with heavy proteinuria for urological investiga-tion. A woman with jaundice was referred by her GP to the community midwife; it subsequently emerged that the woman had HELLP syndrome. GPs have become increas-ingly disengaged from antenatal care and consequently de-skilled, and inappropriate decision-making may be anincreasing problem. The rst port of call to a pregnantwoman with epigastric pain (an important symptom ofsevere pre-eclampsia) may well be her GP. This problemneeds to be urgently addressed. The signicance of epigastric pain in pregnancy also needs to be better understood in Emergency Departments: A woman presented to an Emergency Department in early third trimester with epigastric pain. Her blood pressure was >150/90 mmHg and she had proteinuria +++. She was diagnosed as having 'gastritis' and discharged home, whereshe collapsed and died shortly afterwards. Autopsy showeda cerebral haemorrhage and the typical histological featuresof pre-eclampsia. Treatment of systolic hypertension The single major failing in clinical care in the current trien-nium was, again, inadequate treatment of hypertension,with subsequent intracranial haemorrhage. For example:A woman presented to an Emergency Department during her second trimester with abdominal pain and vomiting.Previously normotensive at the antenatal clinic, her bloodpressure rose from 191/110 to 210/130 mmHg while in theEmergency Department. She had proteinuria +++. She developed a severe headache and pain on breathing and was transferred to the labour ward where she was given acalcium channel blocker and opiate analgesia. Following aneclamptic seizure, treatment magnesium sulphate was started. First hands-on consultantinvolvement occurred around 8-10 hours after admission,at which time her blood pressure was still extremely high(systolic pressure still >200 mmHg) and she was unrous- able. She died shortly after from a large intracranial bleed. This is illustrative of a number of cases in which there was failure to appreciate the seriousness of the situation, afailure to treat systolic hypertension effectively and a failure of involvement of senior clinicians until it was too late. It issystolic hypertension that poses the greatest risk of cere- bral haemorrhage, and very high pressures need to be trea-ted as medical emergencies. This woman, as others, hadlife-threatening systolic hypertension for several hoursbefore her stroke. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on hypertension in pregnancy recom- mend that women with moderate pre-eclampsia should be treated with oral labetalol if systolic pressure reaches 150-160 mmHg. If there is severe pre-eclampsia (with very highsystolic pressures), treatment can be with either oral or intra-venous labetalol, oral nifedipine, or intravenous hydral-azine. 4A combination of drugs may be necessary. There is little evidence of any benet associated with any individualdrug regimen. The priority is to lower the dangerously high systolic pressure. The NICE guideline recommends a target systolic pressure of 150 mmHg. 4Ideally, both consultant obstetricians and anaesthetists will be present for such emer-gencies, and consideration should be given to invasive moni-toring with an arterial line and high-dependency care. As the vignette above illustrates, it is essential that the response to therapy is monitored carefully and, if a responseis absent or inadequate, that suitable treatment is added. It is also worth re-emphasising, as in the last Reports, the observation that some automated blood pressure moni-toring systems systematically under-estimate systolic pres- sure in pre-eclampsia. Third-stage management Three women who died from cerebral haemorrhage devel-oped very high blood pressures shortly after giving birth. All had received intramuscular Syntometrine (oxytocin-erg- ometrine) for active management of the third stage oflabour. One woman had been hypertensive during labour,Neilson 68 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203one had been normotensive, and one had not had her blood pressure checked during what was a rapid labour.Syntometrine is contraindicated in hypertensive womenbecause it may exacerbate hypertension, and a previousReport has recommended that it be avoided in women who do not have their blood pressures checked in fast labours. It is now sensible to reach the conclusion that Syn-tometrine should be avoided as a routine drug completely. Intramuscular Syntocinon (oxytocin without ergometrine)provides almost as effective prophylaxis against does Syntometrine, with fewer adverseeffects, including hypertension. 5Intramuscular oxytocin is not licensed for this use simply because the manufacturers have no commercial incentive to see it licensed. The use of intramuscular oxytocin as the routine drug for active man-agement of the third stage of labour is now recommendedby two NICE guideline development panels. 4-6 Eclampsia It is unprecedented to report so many deaths in apparentlydirect association with eclamptic seizures. In three women, cardiac arrests were witnessed by clinical staff shortly after seizures: one woman, who had received no treatment, hada seizure followed by cardiac arrest in her home in thepresence of a paramedic. Another woman was in hospitaland had received nifedipine but no magnesium sulphate,because of concern about her oliguria. She too had a sei-zure followed by cardiac arrest. The third woman, also inhospital, had received both labetalol and magnesium sul- phate before seizures and cardiac arrest. In a further two women there was less certainty, as they were found col-lapsed at home, but excellent autopsies showed unequivocalhistological evidence of pre-eclampsia and no other pathol-ogy (e.g. cerebral haemorrhage), and it seems highly likelythat these deaths, too, were associated with eclampsia. It iswell recognised that cardiac arrest can occur in associationwith seizures in people with epilepsy (Sudden Unexexpect- ed Death in EPilepsy), and it seems plausible that cardiore- spiratory arrest may have a similar mechanism inassociation with eclamptic seizures. These ndings remindus that there are intrinsic risks to eclamptic seizures. Five other women had pregnancies complicated with pre-eclampsia but, because they died of other causes, arecounted elsewhere. Two women who died from cardiomy-opathy are counted in Chapter 9, two are counted as Other Indirect in Chapter 10 and one woman who died of amni- otic fluid embolism is counted in Chapter 5. Pathological overview Autopsies were performed on 14 women for whom pre-eclampsia was the clinical background to the cause ofdeath, but no report was available for two of these and in athird the report was incomplete. Five of the reports were excellent and six, including the incomplete report, werepoor or worse. Cerebral pathology was conrmed in threeand liver necrosis in one of the ve excellent reports. Inone of these cases a woman died unexpectedly in preg- nancy when normotensive but with ketonuria and oedema. The autopsy report had minimal macroscopic ndings: theclassical changes of pre-eclampsia were subsequently histo-logically demonstrated in her uterus, liver and kidneys. In the ve poor autopsies, there was failure either to address the clinical differential diagnoses or the concludingcause of death bore no apparent relation to the autopsy nd-ings, and sometimes both. No histology was taken in four of these cases. For two, the death was attributed to haemor- rhage despite the clear clinical and pathological ndings ofHELLP syndrome without a clinical history of bleeding inthe one, and a clear description of normal jugular veins (theclaimed source) in the other. The other cases have been clas-sied and discussed with the Other Indirect deaths in Chap- ter 10, though the possibility that pre-eclampsia wasinvolved cannot be excluded. In two of these there was death from cerebral haemorrhage in women with recorded preceding hypertension in pregnancy: in one this was mildand in the other it was transient, though associated withproteinuria. No adequate neuropathological examinationwas performed, and there was no histological search for pre-eclampsia in either case. The third is unascertained: A diabetic woman was started on insulin in the second tri- mester, and her last blood pressure at around 30 weeks hadrisen to 140/95 mmHg. A few weeks later she collapsed athome. A bitten tongue was the major autopsy nding: therewas no histology or toxicology. The assessors cannot classify this as a death from pre- eclampsia but feel that this possibility was not adequatelyaddressed either by direct exclusion or by the determina-tion of a clear alternative cause of death. The autopsy totally failed to address the possible clinical diagnoses and, in particular, failed to search adequately for the histologicalfeatures of pre-eclampsia. The assessors have therefore clas-sied it as unascertained. Although most deaths associated with pre-eclampsia are clear-cut, there are cases where the differential diagnosesrequire a detailed autopsy assessment, if only for exclusionof other possibilities. Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia: pathological recommendation Autopsies on women with a preceding history of pre- eclampsia should have careful histological examinationof the kidneys, liver and uterine placental bed site.Chapter 3: Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia 1-203 69Conclusion The number of deaths from pre-eclampsia/eclampsia has not fallen. The most pressing need, as before, is to treat hyperten- sion (and especially systolic hypertension) quickly and effec- tively to prevent haemorrhagic stroke. Iatrogenichypertension should be avoided by abandoning the use ofergometrine in routine third-stage management. The inci-dence of eclampsia has halved in the UK, presumably as aresult of the widespread use of magnesium sulphate, follow-ing publication of the Magpie trial. 7The UKOSS study has shown that the overall case fatality rate associated with eclampsia is low in the UK, but serious morbidity can occur.2 However, this Enquiry, albeit over a different time-scale, has identied an unprecedented number of deaths associatedwith eclamptic seizures. This is a reminder that eclampsia is aserious complication that, where possible, should be avoided. Disclosure of interests None.

Email: the decline in numbers this triennium, obstetric haemorrhage remains an important cause of maternal death. All units should have protocols in place for its identication and management, and all clinicians responsible for thecare of pregnant women, antenatally, postnatally and intrapartum, including those practicing in the community,should carry out regular skills training for such scenarios. Early senior multidisciplinary team involvement is essential in the management of major obstetric haemorrhage. All clinicians should be aware of the guidelines for management of women who refuse blood transfusion. The welcome absence of deaths in relation to elective caesarean section for placenta praevia in this Report endorsesthe recommendations in earlier Reports that senior staff should be involved in these deliveries. The recommendation in the previous Report that 'All women who have had a previous caesarean section must havetheir placental site determined. If there is any doubt, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used along with ultra-sound scanning in determining if the placenta is accreta or percreta' needs to be restated, as scans for placental locali-sation site in women with previous caesarean sections are still sometimes not being performed. Women delivered by caesarean section should have regular observations of pulse and blood pressure for the rst24 hours after delivery recorded on a Modied Early Obstetric Warning score (MEOWS) chart. Abnormal scores on MEOWS should be investigated and acted upon immediately. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) recommend that women with major placenta praevia who have previously bled should be admitted and managed as inpatients from 34 weeks of gestation. Those withmajor placenta praevia who remain asymptomatic, having never bled, require careful counselling before contemplatingoutpatient care. Women with major placenta praevia who elect to remain at home should have the risks explained tothem and ideally require close proximity with the hospital. Obstetric haemorrhage: learning points Anaemia magnies the effects of anaemia should be diagnosed and treated effectively: parenteral iron therapy should be considered antenatally for women with iron deciency anaemiawho do not respond to oral iron.Moderate or excessive traction on the cord before pla-cental separation is inappropriate. The appropriate ini-tial management of uterine inversion is attemptedreplacement.Any decision to give women blood should be made carefully, and all clinicians involved in blood transfusionshould be aware of the potential adverse effects of trans-fusion and signs and symptoms of transfusion-related complications. Women known to be at risk of major haemorrhage, e.g.those with placenta accreta and those who decline bloodand blood products, should be delivered in maternityunits with access to critical care, interventional radiol-ogy and cell salvage.Chapter 4: Haemorrhage \u00aa2011 Centre 1-203 71Background In the UK, major obstetric haemorrhage occurs in around 3.7 per 1000 births (95% CI 3.4-4.0), with uterine atony being the commonest cause.1The fact that more women do not die is a testament to good multidisciplinary man-agement in the majority of cases. However, the overall rateof postpartum haemorrhage in some developed countriesappears to be increasing. 2In less developed countries, obstetric haemorrhage remains one of the major causes ofmaternal deaths, 3with up to 50% of the estimated 500 000 maternal deaths that occur globally each year being attrib- utable to its effects. Summary of key ndings for 2006-08 In the UK, during 2006-08 there were nine Direct maternal deaths from obstetric haemorrhage, including one associ-ated with a uterine rupture. This gives an overall mortalityrate of 0.39 per 100 000 maternities (95% CI 0.20-0.75). There were also two Late Direct deaths that occurred later in the postpartum period that are not counted in the over-all death rate but that are discussed here as they containvaluable lessons nevertheless. One was the result of theconsequences of placenta accreta and the other was from acombination of postpartum haemorrhage and sepsis in awoman who was already severely anaemic. The nine Direct deaths from obstetric haemorrhage rep- resent a decline from the 14 that occurred during 2003-05, where a rate of 0.66 per 100 000 maternities (95% CI 0.39-1.12) was reported ( P= 0.2). Consequently, this triennium,obstetric haemorrhage is reduced to being the sixth leading cause of Direct maternal deaths and the mortality rate, as shown in Table 4.1, is the lowest since the UK-wide Con- dential Enquiry Reports began in 1985. It is hoped that thisdecline will be maintained in the future, as the numbers are too small to currently be able to infer a statistical trend. Although no rm conclusions about the decline can cur-rently be drawn, it is hoped that the reduction in deathmay reflect improvements in the quality and safety of care,regular drills and skills exercises, the use of guidelines andcloser multidisciplinary working, as recommended in previ-ous Reports. However, this does not mean that lessons can-not be learned from the cases discussed in this Chapter, as there remains room for further improvement. Severe maternal morbidity associated with haemorrhage Peripartum hysterectomy and second-line thera- pies for study (The United Kingdom Obstetric Surveil- lance System [UKOSS], described in the Introductory chap-ter of this Report) conducted between February 2005 andFebruary 2006 estimated the incidence of peripartum hys- terectomy to control haemorrhage to be 40.6 per 100 000 maternities (95% CI 36.3-45.4 per 100 000 maternities). 4 Fewer than 1% of the women who had a hysterectomydied. Thirty-nine percent of women had a morbidly adher-ent placenta, 5and the main documented risk factor was previous caesarean delivery (adjusted odds ratio 3.52, 95%CI 2.35-5.26). Table 4.1.

These deaths were discussed in a separate Chapter in previous reports. **Includes one very late ectopic pregnancy in the third trimester. ***Including one woman with placenta praevia/accreta and ruptured uterus. ****Genital tract tears were implicated in two women who died of postpartum haemorrhage.Norman 72 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal BJOG 118(Suppl. 1-203On requiring second-line therapies wasundertaken through UKOSS between October 2007 andMarch 2009 (Knight M et al, unpublished UKOSS data -personal communication). An estimated 24.4 women per 100 000 maternities were managed either with uterine com- pression sutures, pelvic vessel ligation or embolisation, orfactor VII to treat severe haemorrhage (95% CI 21.7-27.3per 100 000 maternities). An investigation in the group ofwomen managed with uterine compression sutures for fail-ure to control haemorrhage leading to hysterectomyshowed that delay in placement of the suture (more than2 hours between delivery and suture placement) was more frequent in women who underwent hysterectomy (adjusted odds ratio 3.86, 95% CI 1.65-8.99). This emphasises theimportance of early recognition and management of severehaemorrhage to improve outcomes. Morbidity from uterine rupture There were 111 cases of uterine rupture reported toUKOSS between April 2009 and January 2010, (Knight M et al, unpublished UKOSS data - personal communication) representing an estimated incidence of 17.4 cases per100 000 maternities (95% CI 14.3-21.0 per 100 000 mater-nities). Eighty-six percent of cases occurred in women whohad had a previous caesarean delivery. Trends in obstetric haemorrhage A fall in the rate of major obstetric haemorrhage, despite a rise in rate of postpartum haemorrhage, is also apparent from the Scottish audit of maternal morbidity publishedfor 2008, 6which is also described in Appendix 2B. These results, in combination with a fall in the number of deathsin Scotland and in the UK, also point to improved man-agement of this condition. The mothers who died The age range of the mothers who died was from 22 to36 years, with a median of 28 years. Five women were pri-miparous, and three of the other four mothers had at leastone previous caesarean section. The Body Mass Index(BMI) of eight of the nine mothers who died and whoseBMIs were known ranged between 20 and 38 with a med-ian of 23. Six women were of normal weight, one was over- weight and one was obese. Five women described themselves as White British and were regular attenders for antenatal care; a sixth concealedher pregnancy. The three women from other ethnic groupshad had three or fewer antenatal visits, but two womenappeared to have arrived in the UK later in their pregnan-cies in order to give birth here. One had little grasp of Eng-lish, and one of the Late Direct deaths also occurred in awoman from a minority ethnic background who was a poor attender for care. Substandard care Although both the number and proportion of deaths from haemorrhage has fallen in this triennium, there remains room for improvement. Substandard care was a factor insix (66%) of the deaths. For four women it was consideredthat different treatment may have altered the outcome, andin two, although the outcome would probably not havechanged, there were lessons to be learnt. Obstetricians,midwives and hospital management staff need to be vigi-lant and ensure that care is optimised through use of regu- lar drills and skills and adherence to national guidelines to further reduce haemorrhage-related maternal death. Antenatal haemorrhage Placenta praevia and accreta Two of the women whose deaths are counted in this Chap-ter and a Late death of another woman followed a placenta praevia. Two of these three women had placenta accreta as well as placenta praevia, one of whom also had a uterinerupture. A woman who had undergone a number of previous caesar- ean sections and who attended regularly for antenatal care collapsed at home in the third trimester and was moribundon arrival in the Emergency Department. At autopsy, a pla-cental percreta and uterine rupture were found. Ultrasoundhad not been performed antenatally to determine placentalsite, despite her previous caesarean sections. This illustrates the importance of following the guidelines issued in the last Report, for 2003-05, that 'all women whohave had a previous caesarean section must have their pla-cental site determined. If there is any doubt, magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI) can be used along with ultrasound scanning in determining if the placenta is accreta or percre- ta'. 7These recommendations are endorsed by the recently published 'care bundle' for the management of women withplacenta praevia after caesarean section produced by theRCOG and the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA). 8 In one of the other women: A woman whose placenta accreta had been diagnosed ante- natally was correctly delivered in a tertiary referral centrewith a Critical Care Unit (CCU). At the time of deliverythe placenta was conrmed to be morbidly adherent andwas therefore left in situ .Although she made a good recovery in the immediate postpartum period, she became unwell with probable sepsis some weeks after delivery. She was admitted to the initial booking hospital without a CCU andunderwent attempted manual removal of the placenta, atChapter 4: Centre BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 dissemi- nated intravascular coagulation and her eventual deathsome days later . Management of placenta accreta remains a challenge, with no clear evidence on how it should be best conducted.It was the principal indication for peripartum hysterectomyin around 40% of women who underwent this procedurein the UK in 2005. 4Good practice advice from the RCOG9 and the NPSA8suggests that senior multidisciplinary plan- ning is indicated, with predelivery discussion of the possi- bility of the need for hysterectomy to control bleeding. A woman who had a previous caesarean section and a diagnosis of placenta praevia made by scan later in her preg-nancy and who collapsed at home near term illustrates thedangers of outpatient management of severe placenta prae-via. Although outpatient management is now increasinglyundertaken, it is not without risk. There is only one small (<60 women) randomised trial 10and no observational stud- ies of sufcient size on which to base an estimate of the risksof outpatient versus inpatient management. In view of this, the RCOG recommends that ' women with major placenta praevia who have previously bled shouldbe admitted and managed as inpatients from 34 weeks of ges-tation. Those with major placenta praevia who remainasymptomatic, having never bled, require careful counselling before contemplating outpatient care '. 9 In a separate case, counted and discussed in Chapter 6, a woman who had had several previous caesarean sectionsdeveloped a severe haemorrhage early in pregnancy fol-lowed by chorioamnionitis. Placental abruption and other antepartum haemorrhage A woman who had presented several times throughout her pregnancy with abdominal pain and had been scanned onat least four occasions by appropriately qualied staff hadan extrauterine pregnancy that was not diagnosed until thethird trimester. This rare incident illustrates the difcultyin making this diagnosis in the second and third trimestersand also highlights the need to consider ectopic pregnancy in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain throughout pregnancy. The major learning points about scanning inearly pregnancy are discussed in Chapter 6. In another woman: A woman with signicant systemic disease presented with an intrauterine death and placental abruption in her early thirdtrimester. Despite her medical history, abdominal pain andtense abdomen, delivery was delayed by many hours andthereafter started initially with mifepristone. She becameincreasingly unwell but was managed by junior staff withoutmultidisciplinary input. She eventually arrested and under-went perimortem caesarean section over 2 days after the intrauterine death was diagnosed. The cause of death atautopsy was given as fluid overload and acute transfusion-related lung injury. Although NICE guidelines 11indicate that conservative management and/or a delay in labour induction is some-times appropriate in women with an intrauterine death,this does not apply in the presence of major abruption orinfection. In these scenarios, delivery should be expedited. Such women are at high risk of morbidity and mortality and should be managed by an experienced multidisciplin-ary team. This case also highlights the complications ofblood transfusion: acute transfusion-related lung injury isnow a leading cause of transfusion-related mortality andmorbidity. The decision to transfuse women should bemade carefully, and all clinicians involved in blood transfu-sion should be aware of the potential adverse effects of transfusion and signs and symptoms of transfusion-related complications. 12 Postpartum haemorrhage Compared with the two previous Reports, the number from postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) has halved tove. The RCOG have recently for the management of postpartum haemorrhage. 13These empha- sise the importance of active management third stagewith prophylactic oxytocic administration to prevent post-partum haemorrhage and prompt multidisciplinary man-agement in the treatment should it occur. Although there are now a wide array of therapies for postpartum haemorrhage, ranging from vessel embolisationto recombinant factor VIIa, it is disappointing that a major failure in three of the ve women who died (60%) was a lack of routine observation in the postpartum period, or afailure to appreciate that bleeding was occurring. In allthree women there was a lack of optimal postoperativemeasurement of pulse and blood pressure, or recognitionof abnormal vital signs such as oxygen saturation andrespiratory rate, even when it was known the mother hadsustained a large bleed. The use of MEOWS charts, as advocated in the last Report, 7should help to alert caregiv- ers to abnormal trends in haemodynamic measurements,but they are only useful if observations are performed andabnormal readings acted upon. Regular observations ofpulse and blood pressure should be made postdelivery.MEOWS charts enable the identication of readings thatrequire further action. Underlying, longstanding and untreated anaemia, which is often linked with maternal deaths from haemorrhage in developing countries, was also found in a few mothers whodied in this Report.Norman 74 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203A woman who died some months after delivery from multi- organ failure secondary to bacterial pneumonia also sus-tained a postpartum haemorrhage of 1-2 l during acaesarean section. Despite the fact that she was unwell atthe start of the procedure, and also had a haemoglobin of only 7.5 g/dl, senior staff were not alerted until she began to bleed excessively. Antenatal anaemia should be diagnosed and treated effectively: parenteral iron therapy should be considered antenatally for women with iron deciency anaemia who do not respond to oral iron. The case of a woman for whom the stigma of being an unmarried mother appeared too much and who thereforeconcealed her pregnancy, subsequently dying at home of acatastrophic postpartum haemorrhage, although countedhere, is discussed in Chapter 11. Women who refuse blood products The management of women who refuse blood productspresents a continuing challenge in obstetric practice. Ineach of the two previous Reports, there were two deathsfrom haemorrhage in such women; although only one isreported here, there was a further woman for whom thiswas important but who died from an unrelated cause. Suchmothers are known to be at increased risk of death if they suffer a major obstetric haemorrhage: a recent estimate from the Netherlands puts this at around three- to four-fold. 14Clear guidelines for the management of these women were contained in an earlier Enquiry Report7and in guidance from the RCOG.15Good practice advice is to ensure that women discuss their plans to avoid bloodtransfusion with both a consultant anaesthetist and anobstetrician in their antenatal period, that women enter labour with a haemoglobin >10.5 g/dl, that cell salvage is available where appropriate and that operative abdominaland vaginal deliveries are performed by senior anaestheticand obstetric staff. A further lesson is that erythropoietin isnot an effective alternative to red cell transfusion in majoracute haemorrhage because it takes 10-14 days to effect anincrease in haemoglobin levels. 16Women who refuse blood products, their families and religious advisors need to be aware of this. Management of the third stage of labour Uterine inversion occurred as a result of traction on the placenta before separation in a woman who had a retainedplacenta. This resulted in bleeding and vasovagal shock.Uterine replacement was not attempted, but Syntocinonwas given. Clinicians should be aware that developments in the treatment of major haemorrhage do not mean that elementary clinical management can be neglected. Moder-ate or excessive traction on the cord before placentalseparation is inappropriate. Attempted replacement is the appropriate initial management of uterine inversion. Births in midwife-led units or at home With increasing emphasis on the availability of births at home or in midwife-led units, caregivers should ensure that there are appropriate guidelines for management wherelabour and delivery are not straightforward. Obstetriciansand midwives should develop guidelines for the manage-ment of obstetric emergencies that may occur in the com-munity, including uterine inversion and antenatal andpostpartum haemorrhage, and all practitioners should keepup to date with emergency drills for uncommon events. Pathological overview The autopsies of ve deaths from haemorrhage werereviewed this triennium together with two further deaths,one associated with a Grade 4, major placenta praevia andanother with retained placenta. Both of these were classiedas anaesthetic deaths and are counted in Chapter 8. There were two deaths from placenta praevia or accreta and three from uterine rupture or genital tract tears during delivery.The death of one woman from a placenta praevia did notcome to autopsy, but the report on the placenta and subto-tal hysterectomy was available. Although the report con-rmed that there was no abruption, there was no mentionof the site of the placental bed; this should have been com-mented on. Three of the other reports were excellent. For instance, in one woman, cervical tears extending into the broad ligaments had been sutured, but she remained hypo-tensive. When she developed chest pain, an embolus wassuspected. The autopsy very carefully excluded both pul-monary and amniotic fluid embolism. This contrasts with avery poor report which was in 'tick box' format with mini-mal or no other description. The consultant obstetrician,who attended the autopsy, commented in his report to the coroner on discrepancies between his observations at the autopsy and those by the pathologist. These discrepanciesdid not alter the cause or mode of death but do suggestfailures of interpretation and of clinicopathological correla-tion amplied by poor report writing. Review of thesedeaths emphasises the need to address the clinical issuesand for good clinicopathological correlation. Conclusion The decline in haemorrhage-related deaths in this triennium,although not statistically signicant because of the very smallnumbers, is gratifying, and it is hoped that this can be main-tained in future. The absence of deaths in relation to electivecaesarean sections for placenta praevia endorses the previousChapter BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 75recommendations made in successive Reports that senior staff should be involved in these deliveries. Amongst the deaths, the lack of early senior multidisci- plinary involvement, the lack of close postoperative moni-toring and the failure to act on signs and symptoms that a woman is seriously unwell, including readings from MEOWS charts, remain important contributors to maternaldeath from haemorrhage. All clinicians involved in the careof pregnant women could further reduce the risk of haem-orrhage-related maternal death by improvements in theseelementary aspects of clinical care.

At autopsy: conrm the diagnosis using immunochemistry in clinically classical cases where no squames can be found, search for mucins. Amniotic fluid embolism: learning points Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) should no longer be regarded as a condition with near universal maternal mortality. High-quality supportive care can result ingood outcomes for both mother and baby dependingon the place of collapse.There were several examples of excellent practice thistriennium, including prompt peri-mortem caesareansection.AFE may be confused with other presentations, includ- ing eclampsia, septic or anaphylactic shock and pulmo- nary embolism, but ultimately the immediate actiontaken should be resuscitative and the initial treatment isunlikely to differ. Summary of key ndings for 2006-08 In this triennium, the deaths of 13 mothers who died ofAFE were reported to the Enquiry, giving a mortality rateof 0.57 per 100 000 maternities (95% CI 0.33-0.98).Although AFE continues to rank as a major cause of Direct maternal deaths, it has fallen from being the second to the fourth leading cause of Direct deaths this triennium. As shown in Table 5.1, the numbers and mortality rate for this triennium are less than the 17 deaths and mortality rateof 0.80 per 100 000 maternities (95% CI 0.50-1.29) attrib- uted to AFE for the period 2003-05. This decline is not sta- tistically signicant. Neither does it appear that there is anupwards trend, which is consistent with the ndings of thelatest morbidity study from the United Kingdom ObstetricSurveillance System (UKOSS) (A detailed description of UKObstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) can be found in theIntroduction Chapter of this Report.) discussed below. Maternal morbidity: the incidence of amniotic fluid embolism Prospective national surveillance of AFE has been under- taken through UKOSS since 2005. A recent analysis of casesreported over 4 years between February 2005 and February2009 documented an incidence of 2.0 cases per 100 000 Table 5.1. Direct deaths attributed to amniotic fluid embolism and rates per 100 000 maternities; no signicant change in incidence over the 4 years, but the authors notethat, because of small case numbers, surveillance over thisperiod has limited statistical power to detect any trends inincidence. In this series, 20% of women with AFE died (95% CI 11-32%); fatality was signicantly associated with Black or other minority ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio 11.8,95% CI 1.40-99.5). Surveillance is ongoing, and all cases ofAFE, whether the woman survived or not, should bereported to UKOSS, the details of which are given inBox 5.1. Combining the results from this Enquiry and thelatest UKOSS report gives a case fatality rate of 16.5%. His-torically, AFE has been seen as a universally fatal condition with mortality approaching 100%, but with improved approaches to resuscitation, it is possible that improve-ments in mortality from AFE are now being achieved if themother collapses in a well-equipped facility. The diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism The diagnosis of AFE has been accepted on clinical groundssince the 1991-93 Report, 2and this denition has also been used in the UKOSS methodology.1The last Report3con- tained a discussion on how this compares with classicationsin other countries, including a chart highlighting the differ-ence in clinical features in AFE compared with pulmonaryembolism, which is often where confusion may arise. In thepresent triennium, ve cases arose out of diagnostic uncer-tainty in the immediate clinical situation: possible pulmo-nary embolism, septic shock, anaphylaxis coagulation (DIC) was a fea- ture in ten of the cases (77%). In all three cases where DICwas not identied, the women died very quickly after theircollapse, a maximum of 1\u00bd hours. It seems likely that inthese cases the initial effect of the AFE was sufcient tocause cardiopulmonary collapse before DIC set in. The women who died In this triennium the ages of the mothers who died rangedbetween 31 and 42 years with a median of 36 years, slightlyolder than in the previous triennium where the median agewas 33 years. Eight of the women (62%) were parous(maximum para two), and the remainder were nulliparous. The median gestational age at death was 40 weeks, rangingbetween 31 and 41 weeks. There were two twin pregnancies(15%). Seven (54%) of the women had pre-existing medi-cal or psychiatric conditions. These cases included treated essential hypertension, diabetes and anorexia. In the UKOSS morbidity study, 1an association with increased maternal age was observed only in women from ethnicminorities in the study population. In ten women (77%), the critical event occurred at or before delivery, and, of these, six (46%) were in establishedlabour or in the process of delivery. The remainder experi-enced their critical event after delivery. The UKOSS study 1 found 55% of the AFE events that they studied, includingsevere morbidity, occurred at or before delivery, with therest occurring after birth. Of the 12 women for whom BMI data were available, seven had a BMI <30, ve were obese with a BMI 30, one of whom had a BMI >35. Six (46%) of the women were from ethnic minority groups including Black African and Asian. This compares with 29% in the previous Report. The UKOSS study 1 found that women who died were signicantly more likely to be from an ethnic minority group than those who sur-vived (adjusted odds ratio 4.64, 95% CI 1.11-19.5). The index of deprivation for the women who died was evenly distributed through the groups. Only three of thewomen were smokers, and none had any history of knownsubstance abuse. Ten of the women had booked for antena- tal care by 19 weeks of gestation. In none of the remaining three did the late booking influence the content or qualityof care relating to the death. There was considerable homogeneity in the presentation of the cases. They were all characterised by a sudden andunexpected collapse at home or in hospital. For example: An older mother had a generally uneventful pregnancy and was admitted at term in early labour. She collapsed shortlyafter admission and underwent immediate caesarean sec-tion. She suffered a massive haemorrhage after deliveryand, despite excellent emergency care, died very quickly. The clinical circumstances All of the women reported to have AFE in the current tri-ennium were declared dead after delivery, nine of whom (69%) underwent a peri-mortem caesarean section follow- ing their collapse. Four women delivered vaginally beforecollapse, two of whom had instrumental deliveries. Unlikeprevious Reports, none of the women were given Syntoci-non during labour or delivery. Four women had either arti-cial or spontaneously ruptured membranes at full cervicaldilatation and one at 7 cm. With the exclusion of two pre-term babies, the babies' weights ranged from 2870 toBox 5.1. The UK amniotic fluid embolism register All cases of AFE, whether the woman survived or not, should be reported to the AFE Register at UKOSS. Cases may be reported either through the local hospital UKOSS contact, via email toukoss@npeu.ox.ac.uk, or to: UKOSS National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit Old Road Campus Oxford OX5 3DHDawson 78 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-2034490 g with a median of 3570 g. Five of the women had total fetal weights of 4000 g or more, including one set oftwins, and a woman who had gross polyhydramnios. Of the women who died, six (46%) had been induced using prostin analogues. This appears to be an over-rep- resented proportion compared with births statistics for England, Scotland and Wales, 4-6which were a little over 20% during the present triennium (birth statistics arenot collated for Northern Ireland). In the studyfrom occurrence of amniotic odds ratio 3.86, 95% CI 2.04-7.31), althoughthere was no association between induction of labour and fatality. The babies survived delivery in all but one case where a delay in delivery was unavoidable as the mother collapsedoutside a maternity unit. The Enquiry's documentationrelates to the immediate event only, and so it is possiblethat some babies may not have survived the neonatal per-iod or may have suffered birth injury. Quality of care In ve cases there was no substandard care, and care wasconsidered to be exemplary in two of these. In the othereight cases (62%) there was some degree of substandardcare, although the outcome may have been inevitable. Thelearning points included very poor organisation of transferfacilities in a unit; communication breakdowns, includingabsence of a clear lead during resuscitation; delays in con- tacting the consultant obstetrician; delay in communicating to relatives that problems had occurred and two caseswhere documentation of care leading up to the death wasjudged to be unacceptably inadequate. Additionally, in twoof these cases there was avoidable delay in performing cae-sarean section and achieving delivery within 5 minutes ofcollapse, as recommended in the Managing Obstetric Emer-gencies and Trauma manual, 7although it seems unlikely that the outcome would have differed. It is important to remember that in these circumstances the caesarean sectionis being carried out to assist resuscitation of the motherand a delay in transferring her to the operating theatremay be unnecessary. While the role of peri-mortem caesar-ean section may not always influence the outcome in AFE,if a decision is made to carry out the procedure, it needsto be timely, especially as AFE is now regarded as a poten- tially treatable condition. A multiparous woman was induced because of polyhy- dramnios. Induction was followed by vaginal bleeding andblood-stained liquor. After a while she collapsed with no recordable blood pressure, a feeble pulse and a low Glasgow Coma Score. Collapse was accompanied by fetal bradycar-dia, and she was resuscitated in the hope this would assistthe fetal condition. She appeared to improve a little but then collapsed again and developed DIC after an emergencycaesarean section. Two cases were judged to be of sufciently substandard care that a different outcome might have resulted. In a caseof assisted delivery, the instrument was applied severaltimes before delivery was accomplished. The assessors wereunable to determine whether or not the multiple attemptshad led to access by amniotic fluid to the maternal circula- tion. In another case the assessors considered that the delay in providing resuscitative measures might have contributedto the fatal outcome. Four serious untoward incident reports and one root cause analysis report were available to the assessors. Ofthese, only one serious untoward incident report wasdeemed to be of high quality. Six other deaths werereported as having been subject to serious incident report- ing, but as these reports were not submitted to the Enquiry it was not possible to assess the quality of theselocal reviews or the effectiveness of the learning opportu-nities. Pathological overview All cases were subject to autopsy. AFE was conrmed in 11 cases and suspected in the remaining two. There appears to be less uncertainty about the cause of death in the casesclassied as AFE in this Report for 2006-08 compared withthe 2003-05 Report. 3Five autopsy reports were considered to have aspects that were substandard. A further problemin ve cases was a delay of at least 4 days between deathand the autopsy: this may have been the reason for nega-tive histology in one of the cases, though squames were found in the others. Autolysis could certainly have impaired the demonstration of other pathology in this case.In 11 cases, fetal squames were found on routine histology,and these were conrmed by immunochemistry in ve,with a sixth conrmed by histochemistry. There were still a few cases, as in previous Reports, where the assessors had to make a decision about the causeof death on clinical grounds. For example: A mother was induced with vaginal prostin because of being overdue and had a precipitate labour and birth with noimmediate problems. She was later found collapsed and, after resuscitation had been commenced, started to bleed very heavily, which was consistent with DIC. Resuscitationproved impossible. AFE could not be conrmed at autopsybut was not fully sought, as immunochemistry was notused. In another case there was a classical history of collapse in labour, but no squames were found by immunochemis-Chapter 5: Amniotic fluid embolism BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 79try despite an extensive search. This case was accepted because the quality of the autopsy report suggested thatother possible causes had been reasonably excluded. If true,it suggests that squames are a common surrogate markerfor the syndrome but not necessarily its precipitating cause. Conclusions Amniotic fluid embolism, particularly if the collapse happensin a well-equipped unit, should now be considered a treat-able and survivable event in the majority of cases. It has nowfallen to fourth place among causes of Direct maternal deaths but nevertheless continues to be a signicant factor in mater- nal mortality rates in the UK. The clinical presentation of AFE can be confused with other causes of collapse, but effec-tive resuscitation remains the essential common responseirrespective of the underlying cause for collapse. When a death does occur, a detailed prompt autopsy should be performed that includes immunochemistry orhistochemistry. All cases, fatal or not, should be reportedto UKOSS.

Death in early pregnancy: specic recommendation All women of reproductive age presenting to Emergency Departments with gastrointestinal symptoms should have a pregnancy test. Gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly diarrhoea and dizziness, in early gestation are important indicators of ectopic pregnancy. These features need to be emphasised to all clinical staff. The term 'pregnancy of unknown location' based on early pregnancy ultrasound examination should be abandoned. An early pregnancy ultrasound which fails to identify an intrauterine sac should stimulate active exclusion of tubalpregnancy, and even in the presence of a small uterine sac, ectopic pregnancy cannot be excluded. As emphasised in the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Guideline, The Care of WomenRequesting Induced Abortion, 1abortion care should include a strategy for minimising the risk of infective morbidity, at a minimum antibiotic prophylaxis. This should be applied whether the abortion is carried out medically or surgi-cally. Death in early pregnancy: learning points Abnormal placentation at the site of a previous cae- sarean scar can lead to haemorrhagic catastrophesin the mid-trimester, as well as in later pregnancy.The possibility of morbid adherence should be consid-ered when evacuation of retained placenta is under-taken following miscarriage in women who have hada previous caesarean section, and this procedure should be performed by staff of appropriate seniority. Heavy bleeding or bleeding persisting for more than2 weeks following a diagnosis of non-continuingpregnancy needs to be recognised as an indicationfor medical or gynaecological review and considerationof surgical evacuation of retained products of concep-tion.Unless 'handover' communication between hospital doc- tors is meticulous, truncated shift patterns may result in failure to appreciate a woman's deteriorating clinicalstatus.Summary of key ndings 2006-08 Although fewer women died during 2006-08 of causesdirectly resulting from complications arising from earlypregnancy (before 24 completed weeks of gestation) thanin any previous triennium, substandard aspects of carewere identiable in a majority of the 11 women discussedin this chapter. Six deaths occurred because of ruptured ectopic pregnancies and ve followed haemorrhagic com- plications of spontaneous miscarriages. Table 6.1 docu- ments the trends in early pregnancy deaths since the UKReport began in 1985. In addition, seven other early Direct deaths which occurred secondary to sepsis are counted and discussed inChapter 7. Of these, two were associated with spontaneousmiscarriages between 9 and 16 weeks of gestation, two fol- lowed pregnancy terminations, one performed medically and one surgically induced, and the rest were the result ofinfection following spontaneous premature rupture ofmembranes. Another death, attributed to cocaine interact-ing with an anaesthetic for a procedure in early pregnancy,is counted in Chapter 8. Five women died from thrombo-embolism in early pregnancy and are counted and dis-cussed in Chapter 2. In this triennium, no deaths wereChapter 6: Deaths in early pregnancy \u00aa2011 Centre for Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 81associated with either criminal abortion or uterine trauma occurring during termination of pregnancy. The women who died The ages of the women who died ranged between 21 and 41 years with a median age of 36 years. The majority lived instable circumstances and were in long-term relationships.Five were from minority ethnic groups, three of whom didnot speak English, and another woman, a migrant from a former Eastern European country, also spoke no English. In all four of these women the interpretation was provided by afamily member, in one instance by a very young daughter.This is an issue raised throughout this Report and is relatedto one of the key recommendations. Substandard care Overall, care was considered to be substandard in six of the 11 deaths counted in this chapter (54%); in all of these women earlier diagnosis and better treatment may haveresulted in a different outcome. This represents a declinefrom previous Reports but remains a concern. The reasonsare discussed in the relevant sections in this Chapter. Ectopic pregnancy The numbers and maternal mortality rates from ectopic pregnancy from this and previous triennia are shown in Table 6.2. This shows the case fatality rate of ectopic preg- nancies to be the lowest since these gures were rst esti-mated in 1988, and it is to be hoped this trend continuesin the next Report. In this triennium six women, all of whom had previously been pregnant, died from ruptured ectopic pregnanciesduring the rst trimester of their pregnancy. None of thesegestations were cornually or interstitially located. Another death following an extrauterine pregnancy identied during the third trimester is counted and discussed in Chapter 4.An eighth woman died as a consequence of cerebral infarc-tion in association with ectopic pregnancy and is consid-ered as an Indirect death. Three of the women who died were members of minor- ity ethnic groups who may have sought medical advice lateas a consequence of their unfamiliarity with the health ser- vices or because of linguistic difculties. In all women, family members acted as interpreter, which may also havedelayed the diagnosis because of the difculty of passing onsensitive information through a relative. Although the incidence of ectopic pregnancy remained unchanged in this triennium, there has been a welcomedecline in the case fatality rate in women with ectopicpregnancies, suggesting that there is better early diagnosis and treatment. This decline, however, has not reached sta- tistical signicance. One of the key lessons emphasised inprevious Reports does not appear to have been learned:four of the six women who died from early ectopic preg-nancies again complained of diarrhoea, dizziness or vomit-ing as early symptoms, without triggering anyconsideration of extrauterine pregnancy by their medicalattendants. For example: A woman was referred to hospital by her GP because of diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain, with suspectedgastroenteritis. Her haemoglobin value was 10.9 g/dl withtachycardia on admission, but a pregnancy test was not performed. She was then seen by several junior hospital doctors and, during the following few hours, received severallitres of intravenous fluids with a urinary output of lessthan 500 ml and a severe fall in haemoglobin. She diedTable 6.1.

Since 1997-99, 24 completed weeks of gesta- tion has been used as the upper limit. Hence, direct comparisons with data from previous triennia may be misleading.*A woman who died from anaesthesia for an ectopic pregnancy is counted among the anaesthetic deaths in Chapter 8. **A woman who died of a very late extrauterine pregnancy is counted in Chapter 4. ***The deaths of two women who died from sepsis following termination of pregnancy are counted in Chapter 7 and one death associated withcocaine misuse interacting with anaesthesia is counted in Chapter 8.O'Herlihy 82 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203before diagnosis. At autopsy, the abdominal cavity con- tained about nine litres of bloody fluid and clot, together with a ruptured tubal pregnancy. The majority of the women collapsed at home before a diagnosis of pregnancy was apparent and were very ill before coming to medical attention. These deaths empha- sise that even with improved diagnostic protocols andinvestigative modalities, the rst clinical evidence of extra-uterine pregnancy may be a catastrophic collapse. In thetwo other women, there was ample opportunity to suspectectopic pregnancy before collapse occurred. For example: A woman had an ultrasound examination in very early preg- nancy where a diagnosis of 'pregnancy of unknown location'was made, after which serial b-human chorionic gonadotro- phin measurements were arranged. A few weeks later she wasadmitted to another hospital because of diarrhoea, dizziness, abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Repeat ultrasound examination a few hours later queried the presence of a small(9-mm) intrauterine sac and a haemoperitoneum. It wasdecided to perform a uterine evacuation and consider lapa-roscopy if products of conception were not obtained. An evac-uation procedure alone was performed by a junior doctorunfamiliar with the woman, who was then returned to thepostoperative ward where she collapsed and died several hours later. Autopsy revealed massive intraperitoneal haem- orrhage and a ruptured tubal pregnancy. Miscarriage Nine women died as a consequence of complications ofspontaneous miscarriage, an increase compared with each ofthe ve previous triennia. Four of these deaths occurred sec-ondary to infection and are counted and discussed in Chap- ter 7. The remaining ve women died as a result of haemorrhage, in one woman in association with molar preg-nancy, and their deaths are counted here. Potentially avoid-able factors were apparent in three of these ve deaths. Inthree deaths, all occurring at 16-18 weeks of gestation, mas-sive and ultimately uncontrollable haemorrhage was associ-ated with placental localisation at the site of a previous lowersegment caesarean section scar. For example: A woman who had undergone several previous deliveries by caesarean section presented with vaginal bleeding late inher rst trimester, some days after a diagnosis of fetal deathin utero. Miscarriage did not follow treatment with miso- prostol and massive haemorrhage ensued during surgical evacuation, leading to abdominal hysterectomy. Intra-abdominal bleeding continued, associated with disseminatedintravascular coagulopathy, and the woman succumbedduring a further laparotomy. The placenta was found tohave been morbidly adherent to the old lower uterine seg-ment caesarean scar tissue. The introduction of Early Pregnancy Assessment Units has assisted the triage of women presenting with bleeding in therst trimester but has also been associated with more conser-vative and expectant management of non-continuing preg- nancies. Persistent bleeding, as was found in a number of women, needs to be recognised as an indication for promptsurgical evacuation of retained products of conception. Termination of pregnancy In this triennium there were two deaths associated withtermination of pregnancy, one related to staphylococcalTable 6.2.

Both women are counted and discussedin Chapter 7. One further death is cited in Chapter 11. Other deaths before 24 completed weeks of gesta- tion A total of 26 women died of Direct causes of maternal death at less than 24 weeks' gestation, of whom 11 arecounted in this chapter. Of the other early Direct deaths, ve were from thromboembolism and are discussed inChapter 2, two were the result of intracranial haemorrhage and fatty liver and are discussed in Chapter 3, seven were related to sepsis and are discussed in Chapter 7, and onewas caused by staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome aftersurgical termination and is discussed in Chapter 8. There were also 46 Indirect deaths at <24 weeks of gesta- tion. Twelve were from cardiac disease and are counted inChapter 9, 30 were from other Indirect causes and are counted in Chapter 10 and four had psychiatric causes and are counted and discussed in Chapter 11. Gratifyingly, no maternal deaths appeared to have occurred as a direct result of pregnant women dying ofovarian hyperstimulation syndrome following assisted fer-tility therapy this triennium, but one or two cases didoccur in nonpregnant women, which are not currently clas-sied as maternal deaths. Pathology comment Autopsy reports were available in all 11 early pregnancydeaths; all but one of these reports were conducted to ahigh standard. As a general rule, autopsies in such circum-stances should carefully detail the pathological features inthe genital tract and other identiable co-morbidity, diagnosis should be histologically conrmedwhenever possible.Conclusion The number of women dying before 24 completed weeksof gestation was gratifyingly less than in any previous trien- nium. Nevertheless, this total could have been lower still if medical attendants were aware of the potential signicanceof diarrhoea as an early symptom of ectopic pregnancy andthat evacuation of miscarriage during the mid-trimester isa potentially dangerous procedure. An early pregnancyultrasound which fails to identify an intrauterine sac shouldstimulate active exclusion of tubal pregnancy, and, even inthe presence of a small uterine sac, ectopic pregnancy can- not be excluded.

Genital tract sepsis: key message Be aware of sepsis\u2014beware of sepsis Genital tract sepsis: specic recommendations Education All pregnant and recently delivered women need to be informed about the risks and signs and symptoms of genital tract infection and how to prevent its transmisson. Advice should include verbal and written information about pre-vention, signs and symptoms, and the need to seek advice early if concerned, as well as the importance of good per-sonal hygiene. This includes avoiding contamination of the perineum by washing hands before and after using thelavatory or changing sanitary towels, and is specially necessary when the woman or her family or close contacts have asore throat or upper respiratory tract infection. All healthcare professionals who care for pregnant and recently delivered women should have regular training in theearly recognition of abnormal vital signs and serious illness. They should be aware of the signs and symptoms of severesepsis and the need for urgent assessment and treatment to avoid the often rapid progress of this condition. This is par-ticularly important for community midwives who may be the rst to pick up any potentially abnormal signs duringtheir routine postnatal checks. Identication and monitoring Sepsis is often insidious in onset, and carers need to be alert to an y changes that may indicate developing infection. In the commu- nity, vital signs should always be checked in women who have an y signs or symptoms of possible infection, and if infection is likely, the woman must be referred to the obstetric services as s oon as possible. In hospital, Modied Early Obstetric Warning Scoring system (MEOWS) charts should be used to help in the mor e timely recognition, treatment and referral of women who have, or are developing, a critical illness. Immediate antibiotic treatment may be life saving If sepsis is suspected in the community, urgent referral to hospital is indicated. In hospital, high-dose intravenousbroad-spectrum antibiotics should be started immediately without waiting for the results of investigations, as once infection becomes systemic the woman's condition can deteriorate extremely rapidly over a period of a few hours. Guidelines Guidelines for the detection, investigation and management of suspected sepsis should be available for all maternity units, Emergency Departments, GPs and community midwives. A national guideline to cover the identication andmanagement of sepsis in pregnancy, labour, the postnatal period and beyond, which should include specic informa-tion about Group A streptococcal infection, would raise awareness of sepsis, support investigations and management,and help healthcare organisations respond in a timely and consistent way. This should be a priority.Chapter 7: Sepsis \u00aa2011 Centre for learning points A b-hae- molytic streptococcus ( Streptococcus pyogenes ) infection over the past 10 years.Group A streptococcus is typically community basedand 5-30% of the population are asymptomatic carriers on skin or in throat. 1It is easily spread by person-to- person contact or by droplet spread from a person withinfection.Streptococcal sore throat is one of the most commonbacterial infections of childhood, and all of the motherswho died from Group A streptococcal sepsis eitherworked with, or had, young children. Several mothersor family members had a history of recent sore throat or respiratory infection. Contamination of the perineum is more likely when awoman or her family or close contacts have a sorethroat or upper respiratory infection as the organismmay be transferred from the throat or nose via herhands to her perineum. Antenatal education shouldraise awareness of this and the importance of good per-sonal hygiene and washing hands before and after using the lavatory or changing sanitary towels. Introduction Unlike many other causes of direct maternal mortality, deaths from genital tract sepsis have risen rather thandeclined this triennium. Indeed, genital tract sepsis hasbecome the leading cause of Direct maternal death in the UK for the rst time since these Condential Enquiriesinto Maternal Deaths commenced in 1952. This is a causefor concern, particularly as it has occurred against a back-ground of an overall decrease in maternal mortality. But, as discussed in this Chapter, many of these deaths were from community-aquired Group A streptococcal disease,mirroring an overall background increase in mortality fromthis disease in the general population. 2For many of these women, the outcome was unavoidable despite excellent carebecause of the rapid course and late presentation of the ill-ness. However, in others, possible opportunities to savelives may have been missed and lessons remain to be learnt. Sepsis should never be underestimated. Its course is often insidious and staff need to be aware that women withserious illness, especially sepsis, may appear deceptively wellbefore suddenly collapsing, often with little or no warning.Once established, sepsis may be fulminating and irreversiblewith rapid deterioration into septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation and multi-organ failure. The clin-ical course is often so short, especially in Group A strepto-coccal infection, that by the time women present tohospital, it is too late to save them. As a healthcare worker said: 'Even with modern medicine, an experienced team of doctors and midwives could not save a young pregnantwoman. The rapid deterioration caused by the overwhelm-ing sepsis, despite desperate attempts to resuscitate her, willnever be forgotten.' Sepsis is complex, incompletely understood, often dif- cult to recognise and manage, and presents a continuingchallenge. Some deaths will always be unavoidable, but bet- ter training, a structured approach, good care in the com- munity, and, in hospital, prompt investigation andtreatment, particularly immediate intravenous antibiotictreatment and early involvement of senior obstetricians, an-aesthetists and critical care consultants, may help in futureto save some lives. Further information about the patho-physiology, clinical features and management of sepsis isgiven in Chapter 16 and should be read in conjunction with this chapter. Summary of key ndings for 2006-08 The deaths of 29 women who died from genital tract sep- sis, as traditionally dened by this Report, were reportedthis triennium. Of these, 26 Direct deaths are counted in this Chapter and the remaining three, which were Late Direct deaths occurring more than 6 weeks after delivery, outside the international classication for maternal deaths,are counted in Chapter 12. One of these was also associatedwith haemorrhage. These three deaths are discussed herebecause the women concerned became ill before or soonafter delivery and they may contribute to the overall lessonsto be learnt from these cases. The mortality rate from sepsis for this triennium, 2006- 08, is 1.13 (95% CI 0.77-1.67) per 100 000 maternities, compared with 0.85 (95% CI 0.54-1.35) for the last reportand the rate of 0.65 (95% CI 0.38-1.11) for 2000-02,although this increase has not reached statistical signi-cance ( P= 0.1). These rates are shown in Table 7.1 and Figure 7.1. The main reason for the rise in maternal mortality from sepsis in this triennium is the increased number of deaths caused women had signs and symptoms of severe sepsis bythe time they presented to hospital. Although there hasbeen much concern in recent years about hospital-acquired infection with 'superbugs', there is no evidenceof this apart from one woman who was already known tobe a carrier.Harper 86 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203The women who died The ages of the women who died, including the three who died later in the postnatal period, ranged from 15 to41 years with a median age of 34 years. Most were in stablefamily relationships with no signicant social issues. Tenwere from minority ethnic groups, six of whom were asy-lum seekers or recent immigrants, including one migrantworker from a new European Union country who spoke no English. One such mother was not booked until late in her pregnancy although she had regularly attended theEmergency Department with pregnancy-related problems.Four women did not speak English, and, in all cases, closefamily members provided interpretation. The inappropri-ateness of this and lack of interpretation services is a recur-ring theme in this Report and one for which an overallrecommendation has been made.Most women had normal body mass index (BMI) or were slightly overweight with ranges between 18 and 35 with a median of 23.5, but ve had a BMI > 30. This dif-fers from the last triennium where the majority of thewomen who died from sepsis were overweight or obese.Nine were primigravid. Eight women died from sepsisbefore 24 weeks of gestation, with loss of all fetuses. Twelvewomen had a vaginal delivery, and nine had a caesareansection after 24 weeks of gestation. Sixteen of their babies survived; there were ve stillbirths. Substandard care Some mothers had excellent or outstanding care, but for others there were missed opportunities for early interven-tion. Lessons can be learnt from the management of 18 ofthe 26 (69%) mothers who died during pregnancy or withinTable 7.1.

Inmost cases, the outcome was inevitable, but for 12 it mighthave been different had the infection been diagnosed andtreated more promptly. In six others, although the outcome would not have changed, lessons remain to be learnt. There were also lessons to be learnt from the management of someof the women who died later in their postnatal period. The organisms involved The most common pathogen identied among thewomen's deaths was A ( Streptococcus pyogenes ), of which there were 13 cases. There were ve cases of Escherichia coli , one of which also grew Enterococcus faecalis ; three cases of Staphy- lococcus aureus , one of which also grew mixed coliforms; and one case each of Streptococcus pneumoniae ,Morganella morganii and Clostridium septicum. One healthcare worker, known to be a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carrier, died some days septicaemia with Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) virulent subtype. No pathogen was identied in streptococcus ( Streptococcus pyogenes ) this compared with eight in the last Report for 2003-05 and three for maternal deaths from sepsis in 2000-02. This organism should not be confused with the streptococcus Lanceeld Group occasionally causes early neonatal mortality but is a much less common cause of maternal mortality. Group A streptococcus is typically community based, and 5-30% of the population are asymptomatic carriers onskin or in throat. 1It is easily spread by person-to-person contact or by droplet spread from a person with infection. Streptococcal sore throat is one of the most common bac-terial infections of childhood, and all of the 13 womenwho died from it either worked with, or had, young chil-dren. Several mothers also had a history of recent sorethroat or respiratory infection. Contamination of the peri-neum is more likely when a woman or her family or closecontacts have sore throats or other respiratory symptoms, as the organism may be transferred from the throat or nose via her hands to her perineum. Antenatal education shouldraise awareness of this and the importance of good per-sonal hygiene and avoiding contamination of the perineumby washing hands before and after using the lavatory orchanging sanitary towels. All except one mother had intactmembranes until shortly before delivery, although severalhad offensive, smelly or infected looking liquor when theirmembranes ruptured. Studies have shown that bacteria have the ability to cross intact membranes. 3 Group A streptococcus can also cause serious illness such as scarlet fever, bacteraemia, streptococcal shock syndromeand necrotising fasciitis. Historically it is the classic organ- ism associated with puerperal sepsis and was a major cause of maternal mortality before antiseptic practice was intro-duced and antibiotics became available. Increased levels of Group A streptococcal infections tend to occur between December and April, which was true formost of the cases in this Report. Information from theHealth Protection Agency indicates that there were higherthan normal notications of scarlet fever in some regions of England from December 2007 to mid-March 2008, which coincides with many of the cases reported here. 4For most of the 13 women who died, there was no informationabout subtype, but Types M, 12, T1 emm1 and emm11were all identied. The following vignette illustrates the typical symptoms and the rapid and relentless course of Group A streptococ-cal disease despite excellent care: A woman in mid-pregnancy called an out-of-hours GP as she was feverish, shivery and unwell and had a sore throat butwas diagnosed as having a probable viral infection. A fewhours later the GP visited again as she had developed con- stant abdominal pain associated with vomiting, greenish black diarrhoea, and reduced fetal movements but no vaginalbleeding. The GP suspected placental abruption, and,although she was rapidly transferred to hospital, on admis-sion she was critically ill with marked tachycardia, breath-lessness, cyanosis and confusion. The correct diagnosis ofseptic shock was quickly recognised, fluid resuscitation wasstarted, senior consultants were called, advice was sought from haematology and microbiology consultants and appro- priate intravenous antibiotics were commenced immediately.Despite intensive life support she died a few hours afteradmission to hospital. Sickle cell disease/trait Some of the women had underlying medical conditionsthat may have increased their susceptibility to infection,including three Black African women, two of whom diedfrom coliform and one from Staphylococcus aureus infection following spontaneous preterm prelabour rupture of mem- branes (PPROM) between 17 and 23 weeks of gestation. One had sickle cell trait, and two had known sickle cell dis-ease. Women with sickle cell disease are at increased risk ofinfection because of poor splenic function as a result ofdamage from sickle cell disease, and any anaemia may alsoincrease the risk of infection. Maternal mortality in sicklecell disease is estimated to be around 1 in 220 (0.45%). 5 Sickle cell disease in pregnancy is the subject of a UKHarper 88 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) surveillance study from February 2010 until February 2011. As highlighted in Chapter 10, pregnant women with underlying disease, including sickle cell disease, should bemanaged jointly under the care of a consultant obstetrician and a specialist consultant in their underlying condition, in this case a haematologist. All immunisations, includingagainst pneumococcus, should be up to date. Any infec-tions should be treated promptly and prophylactic penicil-lin is recommended. A clear plan of management shouldbe documented in the chart early in pregnancy. A nationalguideline would also be helpful. Sepsis in early pregnancy Eight women, including seven counted in this Chapter andone Late death, died from complications of infections arising before 24 completed weeks of gestation. Two women diedfrom septic miscarriage and two after a termination of preg-nancy. Of these, one did not receive post-procedure prophy-lactic antibiotics and another died from Clostridium septicum septicaemia and necrotising fasciitis. Clostridium infection is a rare but previously reported cause of maternal death, including after termination of pregnancy. Vaginal carriagewas the most likely source of infection and the inflammatoryfocus in the uterus the most likely portal of entry. Necrotis-ing fasciitis is characterised by an overwhelming fulminantcourse with severe pain and muscle inflammation or necro-sis; the majority of patients die within 24 hours of onset. Sepsis following pregnancy loss: learning points All units should have an effective and robust system in place to ensure that peri-abortion antibiotic prophylaxis(metronidazole 1 g rectally at the time of abortion plus,commencing on the day of abortion, either doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days or azithromycin 1 g orally) is offered routinely in accordance with RCOGguidelines. 6 Infection must be suspected and actively ruled out whenwomen who have had a recent termination of pregnancyor spontaneous miscarriage have pyrexia, persistentbleeding or abdominal pain, especially if the pain isconstant and severe. Vaginal swabs, ultrasound scan to exclude retained products of conception and diagnostic evacuation of uterus (evacuation of retained products ofconception) should be considered if there is still doubt;haemoglobin, white cell count, C-reactive protein, andblood cultures be commenced immediately, withoutwaiting for microbiology results.Four women, including a Late death, died from the conse- quences of chorioamnionitis after spontaneous PPROM inthe second trimester. In one case the cause was Morganella morganii. This is a Gram-negative rod bacterium often found as part of the normal intestinal flora, but it can be a rare cause of severe invasive disease and is naturally resis- tant to many b-lactam antibiotics. Chorioamnionitis and brain abscess due to Morganella morganii have both been reported previously. 7 Sepsis before delivery Nine women, including eight counted in this Chapter andone Late death, developed sepsis before delivery after 24 weeks of gestation. Seven women had group A strepto- coccal infection, one had Escherichia coli and for one woman who was extremely unwell on admission therewas no information about whether any microbiologicalinvestigations were performed before antibiotics weregiven. Four had a caesarean section and ve deliveredvaginally. All except two were extremely unwell on admis-sion to hospital, and many received outstanding care once admitted, even though nothing more could have been done to save them. Most of these women had similar symptoms. They had a short history of feeling unwell; some had a recentsore throat, cough or flu-like illness; several had severediarrhoea; a few had vomiting; some felt hot and coldor shivery and had mild or severe pyrexia, although oth-ers had no temperature. One woman was hypothermic and several were tachycardic and hypotensive on admis- sion. All had contractions and abdominal pain that insome cases was constant, severe and not relieved by anal-gesia. Severe maternal infection also affects the fetus\u2014ve babies died in utero , and those delivered by emergency caesarean section for abnormal fetal cardiotocographsneeded resuscitation after delivery, as did a baby born vaginally to a woman who had complained of pelvic pain in late pregnancy. In her case, when the membranes rup-tured at delivery, the liquor was heavily meconium-stainedand smelt offensive. The combination of severe abdominalpain and abnormal or absent fetal heart is more usuallyassociated with placental abruption, but these cases dem-onstrate that when a woman presents with these symp-toms, genital tract sepsis must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Severe sepsis is often a cause of atonic uterine haemor- rhage, which may be further exacerbated by disseminatedintravascular coagulation. For example, one woman haduncontrollable bleeding after vaginal delivery and suffered acardiac arrest <10 hours after admission; another womanwho had an emergency caesarean section under generalanaesthesia because of abnormal fetal cardiotocograph hadChapter 7: Sepsis 118(Suppl. 1-203 89a major intrapartum cardiac arrest post- operatively. Of note, the membranes were intact almost until delivery in eight of the nine women who developed sepsis beforedelivery. Sepsis after vaginal delivery There is a tendency to regard the puerperium as a low-riskperiod compared with pregnancy and delivery, but signi-cant problems can develop during this time. Seven womendied from sepsis that developed after vaginal delivery andthey illustrate how t, healthy women with an uncompli-cated pregnancy and delivery can become critically ill and die in a very short time. Sepsis is often insidious in onset and may not reveal itself for several days postpartum, whenmost women will be at home, especially with routine earlydischarge now encouraged. Some women died from sepsisresulting from perineal infection. For example: A woman with a second-degree tear felt feverish a few days after delivery and then developed severe lower abdominalpain and diarrhoea. She was accurately and quicklyassessed as having sepsis by her community midwife andGP and rapidly transferred to the Emergency Department,whose staff as well as the maternity team had been alertedin advance. She was extremely ill on admission to hospital, and her condition deteriorated despite appropriate treat- ment including triple antibiotic therapy. Despite maximumsupport in intensive care, she died a few hours later. Bloodcultures and perineal swabs grew b-haemolytic streptococcus Lanceeld Group A. Four women died from Group A streptococcal infection shortly after postnatal admission. One had severe lowerabdominal pain and a very low temperature although herpulse and blood pressure were normal. She developedsevere diarrhoea and mottled peripheries and then col-lapsed. Despite immediate resuscitation and excellent inten- sive care, she rapidly died from streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Mastitis A woman developed septic shock from severe breast infec-tion. Women rarely die from breast infection. However,postpartum mastitis is very common, and the symptomscan mimic infection without it actually being present, mak- ing diagnosis of infection all the more difcult. When a woman complains of breast pain, the breasts should beexamined and vital signs should be recorded. If symptomsdo not settle or if they continue to deteriorate within 12-24 hours of conservative management, the woman shouldbe referred urgently to her GP or maternity unit for antibi-otic therapy (flucloxacillin 500 mg 6-hourly or erythromy-cin 500 mg 6-hourly or equivalent oral antibiotic for 10-14 days). Immediate referral to hospital is indicated if the woman is clinically unwell, if there is no response to oralantibiotics within 48 hours, if mastitis recurs, if there arevery severe or unusual symptoms or if there are any otherconcerns. Breast abscesses are not obviously fluctuant, and a surgical opinion may also be needed. Sepsis after surgery Nine women, including eight counted in this Chapter and one Late death, had a caesarean section, but in four women it was performed as a result of their pre-existingdisease. Of the ve women who developed obvious signsand symptoms of infection after the section, four had prolonged prelabour rupture of membranes and one developed septic shock afterwards. One woman who hadhad antibiotic prophylaxis after a caesarean section wasreadmitted and died some weeks later from Staphylococcus aureus wound infection and toxic shock syndrome. In another case: A woman had ruptured membranes for several days before caesarean section for failure to progress in spontaneouslabour. She had been treated with oral amoxicillin and wasgiven a single dose of co-amoxyclav 1.2 g intravenously dur-ing surgery. After delivery she had a cough and sore throatand was discharged a few days later. She then felt cold, was short of breath and was coughing up phlegm. Her commu- nity midwife arranged for her to be reviewed at the hospi-tal, but she collapsed and, even though an ambulancearrived quickly, died in the Emergency Department. Atautopsy, b-haemolytic streptococcus Lanceeld Group A was isolated from her throat, lungs and uterus. Overall learning points The cases reported here demonstrate the huge challengesin identifying and managing severe infection in pregnancyor during or after the postnatal period. Fortunately, death and serious illness from pregnancy-related sepsis are still very rare. However, this means that many healthcare work-ers will have never seen a case so awareness and the indexof suspicion can be low, and the fulminating nature ofmany of the cases is surprising and shocking when it doeshappen. Raising public and professional awareness Some women and their families did not realise how ill theywere or they did not disclose or trivialised signicantsymptoms that might have allowed earlier intervention.Some healthcare workers did not appreciate the signs andsymptoms or severity of the illness. There is therefore aclear need to raise both maternal and professional aware-ness about antenatal, intrapartum and puerperal sepsis sothat it can be prevented where possible, recognised quicklyHarper 90 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203and managed effectively and immediately. This is one of the major recommendations of this Report. In addition,local guidelines or protocols must be available in all mater-nity units, Emergency Departments and should be used byGPs and community midwives. Until national guidelines are produced, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (www.surviv- ingsepsis.org) has guidelines and care bundles that help toguide the management of severely septic women. 8This is also helpfully discussed in Chapter 16. Prophylaxis Antibiotic prophylaxis is crucial in several clinical scenar-ios, as shown in the Learning point box. In particular, there is evidence demonstrating an association between infection ascending from the lower genital tract and pro-longed rupture of membranes. This increases the risk ofchorioamnionitis and should increase alertness for othersigns of sepsis. In women with PPROM, about one-third ofpregnancies have positive amniotic fluid cultures. 3Several women who died had prolonged rupture of membranes,and the lessons to be learnt, as in other cases, are largely around the early recognition of sepsis. Sepsis prophylaxis: learning points All units should have an effective and robust system in place to ensure that peri-abortion antibiotic prophylaxis(metronidazole 1 g rectally at the time of abortion plus, commencing on the day of abortion, either doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days or azithromycin 1 gorally) is offered routinely in accordance with RCOGguidelines. 6 Routine antenatal antibiotic prophylaxis with erythro-mycin (250 mg orally 6-hourly) for 10 days is recom-mended in women who have PPROM before 37 weeksof gestation. 3 For prelabour rupture of the membranes at term (i.e.after 37 weeks of gestation), if there is evidence of infec-tion, a full course of broad-spectrum intravenous antibi-otics should be prescribed. 9 Women having a caesarean section should be offeredprophylactic antibiotics, such as a single parenteral doseof rst-generation cephalosporin or ampicillin, toreduce infections (such as endometritis and urinary tract and wound infections), which occurs in about 8% of women who have had acaesarean section. 10 Broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended followingobstetric anal sphincter repair (third- and fourth-degreetears) to reduce the incidence of postoperative infectionsand wound dehiscence. 11Early diagnosis When a woman becomes unwell, she is most likely to seekhelp from her GP, community midwife, local maternityhospital or Emergency Department, where she will proba-bly be seen rst by more junior members of the medical team. It is therefore essential that such front-line staff are fully aware of the signs and symptoms of sepsis and canrecognise critical illness. Telephone help lines have limita-tions\u2014in one case a woman sought advice on more thanone occasion because of persistent abdominal pain andbleeding, but the urgency of the situation was not recogni-sed and inappropriate advice was given. There were also failures or delays in recognising the signs and symptoms of sepsis and critical illness among hospital staff. For example: A woman who attended the maternity unit several times with abdominal pain, vaginal discharge and suspected spon- taneous rupture of membranes was never assessed by a seniordoctor. She was eventually admitted shivery and feverish,with vomiting, diarrhoea, vaginal discharge, abdominal painand contractions. Although her temperature was normal, shewas hypotensive and tachycardic. She delivered soon afteradmission, yet her observations were infrequent and noaction was taken despite her failure to improve. It was not until she collapsed several hours later that antibiotics and aggressive treatment were commenced but too late. A vaginalswab taken on admission grew Group A streptococci. A detailed history of symptoms is important to help diag- nosis. Possible signs and symptoms are given in Box 7.1. Unusual anxiety, panic and restlessness may be the result of serious underlying illness: A GP called to see a woman because of nausea, breathless- ness and severe 'after pains' a few days after postnatal dis-charge noted that she had a fast pulse and seemed 'nervousand worried' and arranged hospital admission. A doctorwho saw her some time later observed that she was generallyunwell, seemed very anxious about being in hospital, andlooked 'terried'. No one recognised how ill she really was,antibiotics were late and inadequate, and no consultant was involved in her care until she arrested a few hours later. Investigation and follow up The cases discussed here illustrate various clinical scenariosand also demonstrate that sepsis can mimic other condi- tions such as gastroenteritis, ectopic pregnancy, placentalabruption, mastitis, pulmonary infection and pulmonaryembolism and must be included in the differential diagno-sis of these conditions. The clinical picture in sepsis doesnot always reflect the severity of the underlying illness. Thisis a common problem in obstetric morbidity\u2014the onset ofChapter 7: BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 91sepsis may be insidious where young, healthy women can maintain a normal pulse and blood pressure until the latestages of an acute disease, before suddenly becomingshocked, by which time it may be too late for effectivetreatment (Box 7.2). Although a high white cell count and pyrexia are usual, sepsis is sometimes accompanied by leucopenia or hypo-thermia, which can mislead carers into underestimating theseverity of illness and losing valuable hours before startingappropriate treatment. Neutropenia, caused by bone mar-row suppression, is an ominous sign. The signicance of afalling white cell count may not be appreciated unless serialresults are reviewed. One woman had a very high C-reactive protein and falling white cell count followed by diarrhoea in the days afterdelivery. The signicance of this was not appreciated until she became very ill. Earlier recognition of sepsis and earlierconsultant involvement might have resulted in a differentoutcome by more aggressive treatment with broad-spectrumhigh-dose intravenous antibiotics. Results of investigations must be followed up promptly. If investigations are urgent, this should be made clear onthe request form and telephone contact should be made if appropriate. There should be a robust system for recording and charting investigations performed, obtaining resultsquickly, and ensuring that abnormal results are highlightedand followed up. A simple table to record all blood resultsday by day on a single page is a good way to show trendsand highlight abnormal results but is not routine practicein all units.Box 7.1. Signs and symptoms of sepsis Pyrexia is common, but a normal temperature does not exclude sepsis. Paracetamol and other analgesics may mask pyrexia, and this should be taken into account when assessing women who are unwell. Hypothermia is a signicant nding that may indicate severe infection and should not be ignored. Swinging pyrexia and failure to respond to broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics is suggestive of a persistent focus of infection or abscess. Persistent tachycardia >100 b.p.m. is an important sign which may indicate serious underlying disease and should be fully investigated. Tachypnoea is sepsis until proved otherwise\u2014persistently increased respiratory rate >20 breaths/minute is a signicant clinical nding that can also indicate other serious pathology, such as pulmonary oedema, pneumonia, thromboembolism or amniotic fluid embolism, and impending \u00b7109white blood cells/l is a signicant nding that may indicate severe infection. Diarrhoea is a common and important symptom of pelvic sepsis. Diarrhoea and/or vomiting in a woman with any evidence of sepsis is a very serious sign and an indication for commencing immediate broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy. Severe lower abdominal pain and severe 'after-pains' that require frequent analgesia or do not respond to the usual analgesia are also common important symptoms of pelvic sepsis. In some cases, very severe lower abdominal pain may be the result of the action of bacterial toxins on the bowel wall. On rare occasions overwhelming streptococcal infection can present with generalised abdominal pain in the absence of pyrexia and tachycardia. An abnormal or absent fetal heart beat with or without placental abruption may be the result of sepsis. Box 7.2. If sepsis is suspected: prompt investigation and follow up Infection must be suspected and actively ruled out when a pregnant or recently delivered woman has pyrexia, persistent bleeding or abdominal pain, especially if the pain is constant and severe, or if there is a history of prolonged rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis or any other infection. Investigations include an ultrasound scan to check for retained products of conception and diagnostic evacuation of retained products of conception considered if there is still doubt; haemoglobin, white cell count and C-reactive protein; blood cultures if pyrexia >38 /C176C; and swabs (throat, vagina), midstream urine and any other relevant samples (e.g. sputum, breast milk, stool) for microbiology. High-dose broad- spectrum intravenous antibiotics should be commenced immediately, without waiting for microbiology results. Elevated C-reactive protein is an early marker of infection that should alert carers to make regular observations of vital signs, initiate investiga - tions to locate a source of infection, and consider whether antibiotic treatment is indicated. A throat swab should be taken when a pregnant or recently delivered woman presents to healthcare with a sore throat or respiratory symp- toms, and there should be a low threshold for antibiotic treatment (see the new Back to basics section at the start of this Report). If infection is suspected during labour or delivery (e.g. pyrexia, smelly liquor, smelly baby, unexpectedly flat baby at birth), swabs for microbiol- ogy should be taken from the vagina, placenta and baby (ear, throat, skin). The placenta should be sent for histology. The paediatric team should check the baby and consider performing a septic work-up. The woman and her baby should not be discharged from hospital until the results are available, or at the very least with good arrangements for follow-up and full information, and liaison with her community carers.Harper 92 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203Early treatment As in previous Reports, delays in recognising sepsis, pre- scribing antibiotics and seeking consultant help were com-mon. Immediate aggressive treatment in the rst 'goldenhour' or so offers the best hope of recovery, as each hour of delay in achieving administration of effective antibiotics is associated with a measurable increase in mortality. 8One of the most important key recommendations for sepsis isthat adequate doses of systemic antibiotics started promptlymay prevent infection becoming established and may belife-saving. Antibiotics were sometimes prescribed in inadequate doses, were given orally rather than intravenously, were given too late or were discontinued too soon. Initial treat- ment with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics may haveprevented pelvic sepsis in some women and septicaemia in awoman admitted in the third trimester with SROM and symptoms of chorioamnionitis. In another case, attentioncentred on fetal decelerations in a woman who was hypoten-sive, tachycardic and hypothermic, and antibiotics were notcommenced for some hours after admission. Further information about the treatment of maternal sepsis is given in Box 7.3 and in Chapter 16 and should beread in conjunction with this section. Clinical issues Fluid balance and pulmonary oedema Fluid overload may have contributed to the outcome for a few women who were given large volumes of intravenous fluid over a short time and developed pulmonary oedemashortly before they died. In one example, a very sick Box 7.3. Sepsis: antibiotic therapy Surviving Sepsis Guidelines8recommend that: Intravenous antibiotic therapy be started as early as possible and within the rst hour of recognition of septic shock and severe sepsis without septic shock, as each hour of delay in achieving administration of effective antibiotics is associated with a measurable increase in mortality. Appropriate cultures should be obtained before initiating antibiotic therapy but should not prevent prompt administration of antimicrobial thera py. Initial empirical anti-infective therapy should include one or more drugs that have activity against all likely pathogens and that penetrate in adequate concentrations into the presumed source of sepsis, as failure to initiate prompt and effective treatment correlates with increased morbidity and mortality; women with severe sepsis or septic shock warrant broad-spectrum therapy until the causative organism and its antibiotic sensitivities have been dened. All women should receive a full loading dose of each antimicrobial, but as women with sepsis or septic shock often have impaired renal or hepatic function, measuring serum levels may be necessary, and advice about further doses should be sought from the critical-care team or a consultant physician. The antimicrobial regimen should be reassessed daily to optimise activity, to prevent the development of resistance, to reduce toxicity and to reduce costs. If and when a specic organism is identied, antibiotic therapy can then be modied to the most appropriate regimen. Duration of therapy should be typically 7-10 days; longer courses may be appropriate in women who have a slow clinical response, undrainable focus of infection, or immunological deciencies, including neutropenia. Blood cultures will be negative in >50% of cases of severe sepsis or septic shock, even though these cases are very likely to be caused by bacteria or fungi, so that decisions to continue, narrow, reduce or stop antimicrobial therapy must be made on the basis of clinical judgement and clinical information. Choosing the most appropriate antibiotic regimen may be complex and advice should be sought from a consultant microbiologist as soon as possible. This should never delay urgent treatment, and some suggested choices of initial empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy in genital trac t sepsis are outlined below: Where the organism is unknown and the woman is not critically ill: co-amoxiclav 1.2 g 8-hourly plus metronidazole 500 mg 8-hourly cefuroxime 1.5 plus metronidazole 500 mg or cefotaxime 1-2 g 6- to 12-hourly plus metronidazole 500 mg 8-hourly In cases of allergy to penicillin and cephalosporins, clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily or clindamycin (600 mg to 1.2 g by intravenous infusion three or four times daily) plus gentamicin to give Gram-negative cover are possible alternatives while waiting for microbiological advice. In severe sepsis or septic shock (seek urgent microbiological advice): Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g plus gentamicin (3-5 mg/kg daily in divided doses every 8 hours by slow intravenous injection). A carbapenem such as meropenem (500 mg to 1 g 8-hourly by intravenous injection over 5 minutes or by intravenous infusion) plus gentamicin may also be added. Metronidazole 500 mg 8-hourly may be considered to provide anaerobic cover. If Group A streptococcal infection is suspected, clindamycin (600 mg to 1.2 g by intravenous infusion three or four times daily) is more effective than penicillin as it inhibits exotoxin production.12 If there are risk factors for MRSA, add teicoplanin 10 mg/kg 12-hourly for three doses then mg/kg or linezolid 600 mg twice daily.Chapter 7: 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 93woman was given several litres of fluid over a few hours, after which she developed severe chest pain and breathless-ness, followed by frank pulmonary oedema and cardiacarrest. Another woman with high urea and creatinine andminimal urinary output despite two litres of fluid had acute renal failure, but dehydration was diagnosed and some additional litres of fluid over a few hours were pre-scribed inappropriately. Fluid balance is difcult to manage in septic shock. Sep- tic shock may be dened as sepsis with hypotension whichis refractory to fluid resuscitation. of vasomotor tone causing arterial vasodilationalong with reduced cardiac output because of myocardial depression, and there is also increased vascular permeability so that fluid leaks into the extravascular compartment.Renal failure and use of oxytocic drugs, which are anti-diuretic, may compound the problem. Careful monitoring of fluid balance is important. Clear, accurate records of all intravenous fluids given and urinaryoutput and any other fluid loss should be kept and chartedso that signicant fluid decit or excessive input can be easily detected. Although aggressive fluid resuscitation is usually needed in severe sepsis and septic shock, thisshould always be under close monitoring to evaluate thewoman's response and avoid the development of pulmo-nary oedema. 8Vasopressors are usually required, and a central venous pressure line may help to monitor fluid bal-ance. It is essential to involve the anaesthetic and critical-care teams as early as possible in the care of such critically ill women. Fluid balance in septic shock: learning points Septic shock is sepsis with arterial hypotension that is refractory to fluid resuscitation. Fluid overload may lead to fatal pulmonary or cerebral oedema.Clear, accurate documentation and careful monitoringof fluid balance is essential to avoid fluid overload inwomen who are unwell, especially when hourly urineoutput is low or renal function is impaired. The adviceof an anaesthetist and the critical care team should besought at an early stage. Sustained increase in respiratory rate >20 breaths/minute or low oxygen saturation despite high-flow oxygen aresignicant clinical ndings that should prompt urgentexamination of the lung elds, lower limbs (for evidenceof deep vein thrombosis), arterial blood gas measure-ment, electrocardiogram, and consideration of chest X-ray and ventilation perfusion scan to rule out problemssuch as pulmonary oedema, embolus or infection.Removing the source of sepsis The focus of infection should be identied as a priority,and, if surgery is necessary to remove the source of sepsis,it should be carried out earlier rather than later or as alast resort\u2014whether laparotomy, evacuation of suspected retained products of conception, or other procedure. Lapa- rotomies were performed in several of the women withthe aim of identifying and removing the septic focus.Deciding whether to operate is difcult, particularly whena woman is already critically ill and there is a high risk ofmassive haemorrhage. It is important to stabilise thematernal condition as far as possible before giving anaes-thesia, which may further destabilise the woman, and to ensure that adequate cross-matched blood and blood products are readily available. When there is massive ato-nic uterine haemorrhage, conservative measures such ascarboprost may be tried, but if response to initial doses ispoor, hysterectomy undertaken sooner rather than latermay be lifesaving. In most cases laparotomy was under-taken as a last resort, but in a few cases earlier interven-tion may have changed the outcome. In one woman whose uterus was clearly infected, hysterectomy was con- sidered but decided against because she was critically illand surgery was considered too risky; in retrospect itmight have offered a chance of survival. Operative intervention: learning points Persistent or swinging pyrexia and failure to respond to treatment may be the result of a persistent deep-seatedfocus of infection. Every effort should be made to locateand deal with the source of sepsis. Computed tomogra-phy is a useful investigation but may not show soft tis-sue changes clearly, so magnetic resonance imagingshould also be considered. If the uterus is the primary focus of postnatal infection, retained products should be excluded by ultrasoundscan and exploration of the uterine cavity considered ifthere is still doubt. Hysterectomy should be consideredat an early stage, even if the woman is critically ill,because it may be lifesaving.Before surgery, adequate cross-matched blood andblood products should be requested and the maternal condition should be stabilised as far as possible. Carboprost can be effective in the treatment of uterineatony but has serious adverse effects, including airwayconstriction and pulmonary oedema, so it should beused with great caution\u2014especially if multiple doses arerequired. If there is no response to one or two doses,other methods of dealing with the situation, such ashysterectomy, must be considered.Harper 94 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203Laparotomy for suspected intra-abdominal infection should involve a general surgeon as well as an obstetri- cian, as surgeons have a fundamentally different approach to laparotomy and are more likely to make amid-line incision to allow full exploration of theabdominal cavity. Leadership and continuity of care When managing complex cases, it must be clear who is incharge of the woman's care. This is particularly importantwhen an unwell pregnant woman presents to the EmergencyDepartment rather than the Maternity or GynaecologyDepartments, as there may be a tendency for everyone to assume that someone else is looking after her. In one case, although several doctors were involved in one woman's earlycare, no consultant took overall responsibility, nor were anti-biotics given, until she collapsed over 24 hours after admis-sion, by which time the outcome was inevitable. Documentation and communication Many different medical, nursing and midwifery staff may be involved in the ongoing care of an unwell woman and each may see her only once or twice. This makes the assess-ment of any changes in the woman's condition very dif-cult. In some of the cases already discussed in this Chapter,the mother's vital signs were either not recorded routinelyor their signicance was not recognised. One of the 'Topten' recommendations in the last Report was for routineuse of a MEOWS chart to help in the more timely recogni- tion, treatment and referral of women who have, or are developing, a critical illness. A MEOWS chart is the easiestway to see trends in a woman's condition and to alert staffto take appropriate action or call for help. For example: A woman in late pregnancy with a short history of sore throat, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain was tachy-cardic and hypotensive on admission. Sepsis was not diag-nosed for some hours. The severity of her condition might have been recognised sooner if a MEOWS chart had been used, and earlier antibi-otic treatment and multidisciplinary care in a high-depen-dency setting might possibly have changed the outcome. Involvement of other staff Anaesthetic and critical-care staff play a vital part in the effective management of sepsis and should be involved as early as possible, particularly when there is circulatory orrespiratory failure. For six women, also discussed in Chap-ter 8, there were signicant delays in seeking help from an-aesthetists and critical-care specialists.In some cases, hospital departments seemed to be very busy and staff were said to be overstretched, although it isnot clear if this was directly related to the outcome. Forexample, it took several hours for two ill women to be seenby a doctor or obstetric team because they were said to be very busy elsewhere. The husband of another very sick woman complained about the wait in a busy maternity unitand was told that, as his wife was not seriously ill, the doctorwas seeing other more urgent patients. She died shortly after. Apart from the women whose rapidly fulminating dis- ease meant they died at home or shortly after admission inthe Emergency Department, most other women died incritical care or operating theatres, reflecting the gravity of their condition. However, a few died in hospital wards, illustrating that seriously ill women were sometimes man-aged in inappropriate settings with inexperienced stafflooking after them. Sometimes there was a lack of co-ordinated care and lit- tle or no support from senior staff when requested, butthere were also many examples of excellent teamwork. Forexample, as the assessors noted: This woman was extremely ill on admission and could not have been saved. Her care could not have been better.Everyone, including consultants, was called and attendedextremely promptly, even though it was the middle of the night. The teamwork was excellent. For most cases, there was a critical review by the Trust, and some also invited external assessment. Some of these reviews were excellent, but, as with other cases counted in other chapters, many focused on irrelevant issues and failedto identify major elements of substandard care or to learnanything from the event.

A possible future approach to case denitions Sebastian Lucas Background In previous triennial maternal deaths reviews, as in this, almost all deaths due to Group A beta-haemolytic Strepto- coccus pyogenes (GAS), as well as other infections that can be related to pregnancy or delivery, have been discussedand counted in Chapter 7: Sepsis asDirect maternal deaths from genital tract infection. Other infections unre-lated to the genital tract but whose effects might havebeen amplied by the altered immune state of pregnancy,such as tuberculosis, pneumococcal meningitis and pneu-monia, fungal infections and HIV disease are generally considered as Indirect maternal deaths and counted in Chapter 10. Similarly, although the 2009-10 H1N1 influ-enza epidemic occurred after this triennium, such caseswill be discussed in the next Report and considered to beIndirect deaths. Under 'genital tract sepsis' in the last Report, for 2003-5, GAS and E.coli were the commonest causes of infection, and these were considered by subsets: sepsis in early preg- nancy; sepsis before delivery; sepsis after vaginal delivery (puerperal sepsis); sepsis after surgery; sepsis before or dur-ing labour. In the current Report these divisions continueto enable trend analysis, especially since the death ratesfrom GAS have increased, but this Annex explores the pos-sibility of using a new system for classifying pregnancy-related sepsis. This is based on practical experience of sep-tic deaths in pregnant and non-pregnant women, reviews of the 2006-08 cases and of the literature, as well as discus- sions with microbiologists. As a result, this Annex proposes that, under the sys- tem outlined here, about one third of the deaths in thistriennium which would currently be considered to bepregnancy-related sepsis, would be no longer classiableas due to Direct orIndirect causes .Instead, they may actually be Coincidental to pregnancy. The new system may provide a more useful way of considering remedi- able factors and of determining the source of infectionand whether it is a hospital care associated infection(HCAI) or community-acquired. Of these, the latter cate-gory of community-acquired infections are likely to bethe majority.The WHO classication of puerperal sepsis The World Health 1995 stratied and classied puerperal infections as follows: Puerperal infections - general Puerperal sepsis and urinary tract infection Infections related to the birth process, but not of thegenito-urinary tract Incidental infections Puerperal sepsis is then described as follows : Infection of the genital tract occurring at any time between rupture of membranes or labour, and the 42nd day postpartum, in which two or more of the following arepresent; Pelvic pain Fever Abnormal vaginal discharge Abnormal smell of discharge Delay in reduction of size of uterus. A proposed new pathogenetic classication of sepsis in pregnancy The WHO system is a clinical case denition, not a patho- logical classication, and mainly intended for applicationin resource-poor (ie diagnostic pathology-poor) settings.The proposed new classication system suggested here builds on the above concepts. It is based on consideration of the: timing of infection source of infection route of infection into mother role of operative interventions type of bacterial infection pathology - gross and histopathological The proposal identies ve main categories. These are shown in Table A7.1 together with an analysis of how thematernal deaths from sepsis assessed by this Enquiry in theUnited Kingdom for 2006-08 would satisfy these criteria. It is important to note the classications and numbers discussed in this Annex are only suggestions, and for thistriennium the gures quoted in Chapter 7 must be usedas they help identify trends and rates as well as containAnnex 7.1. A possible future approach to case denitions \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 97valuable lessons and recommendations. There is inevitably not an exact match between the cases considered in this Annex and the cases discussed in Chapter 7, sincethe new classication is more inclusive. However,whatever the new classication system proposes andwhatever type of death is ascribed to the case, it must benoted that valuable and important lessons remain tobe learnt from all of these deaths, irrespective of casedenition. Discussion of cases for 2006-08 by proposed category of sepsis Category 1: Unsafe abortion There were no cases in this triennium, but there was one in 2003-5. Nonetheless, this is an important cause of mor-tality in resource-poor countries. Any such deaths are obviously Direct maternal deaths. Category 2: Presenting with infection and rupture of membranes The majority of these six women had presented by 22 weeks' gestation; the others presented later in the secondtrimester or at term. They had documented chorioamnioni-tis and/or endomyometritis (CAE). The infecting organisms were gram-negative or of unknown type (n= 1); none were streptococcal. The women with positive E.coli blood cultures had the bacteraemias sampled in life, not at autopsy. The staphylococcus case was identied withautopsy uterus and spleen culture. Sickle cell disease (HbSS or SC phenotype - it was not distinguished) was probably a co-factor in one case. Another had chorio-amnionitis and fetal amniotic infection syndrome, whose placental culture grew Morganella spp .A few weeks later she presented with and died of purulentmeningitis with brain abscesses (not cultured). There wasno autopsy but, on balance, it is considered that the cere-britis related to the septic miscarriage. Another patient who presented at 41 weeks with ROM and fever (no organism identied) was given amoxicillin, to which she was allergic, and died of anaphylactic shock. The autopsy was good, with demonstration of chorio-amnionitis, and extensive neuropathology, but did notinclude mast cell tryptase analysis; evidently the pathologisthad not encountered this acute anaphylactic scenariobefore. Fortunately that blood test had been done in life toconrm the pathogenesis.Table A7.1 Proposed new categories for maternal deaths from sepsis classication system and the number of cases* that would be included using this system. United Kingdom: 2006-08 Category Number Case denition Proposed new classication of maternal deaths 1 Unsafe abortion 0 Unsafe /illegal termination of pregnancyDirect 2 Ruptured membranes (genital tract sepsis)6 Presenting with genital tract infection at time of 'spontaneous' ruptured membranesDirect 3 Post-delivery (genital tract sepsis). 14 Vaginal or caesarean delivery, or termination of pregnancy, or other intervention; a ''well interval'' - one day to weeks; with genital tract infection as evidenced by clinical, microbiological and histological features.Direct orIndirect depending on each case, timing and route of infection Direct 6 Indirect 8 4 Community acquired sepsis in pregnancy11 Membranes intact, not in labour, bacteraemic sepsisCoincidental 5 Severe post-partum sepsis related to the birth process but genital tract not involved5 Various scenarios eg spinal anaesthesia, Caesarean section wound infectionsDirect 6 Other, co-incidental infections.

Category 3: Sepsis post-delivery (genital tract sepsis). Fourteen women fall into this category. Following vaginal or caesarean delivery, termination of pregnancy (TOP) ormiscarriage, there is a ''well interval'' ranging from one dayto weeks; with genital tract infection as evidenced by clini-cal, microbiological and histological features. This category includes the 'Semmelweis scenario' of post-partum overwhelming GAS infection via the genital tract, where the agent might have come from the patient'smidwife or doctors 2. However, as will be seen, this was potentially possible in only 5 of the cases. From review ofthe circumstances, the majority of the women died ofinfections that were present in their lower gut flora (egE.coli or staphylococci) or were acquired post-partum from the community. This group is sub-divided into those women who devel- oped sepsis whilst still in hospital ( n= 2) and those who were re-admitted septic from home ( n= 12). They can also be sub-divided into those who had caesarean section(n= 3), vaginal delivery ( n= 8), miscarriage ( n= 1), or termination of pregnancy ( n= 2). The infecting agents comprise faecal flora ( n= 4), which is subcategorised as E. coli (n= 2, one of which was Staph unknown agent.The two women who died following a termination of pregnancy had accidental perineum-derived infections.Staph aureus caused a disseminated necrotising infection in one woman who presented a few days later; at autopsy, theuterus was not perforated. The other woman developed a disseminated necrotising infection due to Clostridium septi- cum several weeks after TOP. A third woman had a trau- matic vaginal delivery where a tear developed into a recto-vaginal stula and necrotising fasciitis due to the virulentESBL E. coli . Three women died after caesarean section (CS). All had ascending endomyometritis, presenting within a week ofoperation. The organisms were respectively GAS, MRSA and E.coli ; in the latter case, a serious co-morbidity was chronic brosing eosinophilic myocarditis, which doubtlessexacerbated the infection. The timing of delivery GAS ( n= 5) and and the post-CS GAS ( n= 1), infections is important. Clinical sepsis developed from 2 to35 days post-delivery, with a median of ve days, and allhad gone home. Where an autopsy had been done, all had endomyometritis, i.e. ascending genital tract sepsis. From the known rapidity of progression of GAS infection, it isthus likely that most, if not all, of these infections wereacquired in the community and not from any hospitalstaff. Two vignettes illustrate some of the problems in evaluat- ing deaths in this category: A woman had a normal vaginal delivery in hospital but collapsed at home some days later. After rapid transfer tothe Emergency Department, the initial clinical evaluationwas pulmonary embolism (PE), and she was given strepto-kinase but died shortly after. The autopsy found no embo- lism but grew Streptococcus pneumoniae in the blood. The genital tract was also inflamed, indicating ingress ofthe pneumococcus via the vagina. absence of PE, querying whether thrombolysis couldactually remove all the evidence of PE at autopsy. Consul-tation with many pathologists and reviewing the limited lit-erature strongly support the contention that up to twohours of resuscitation with thrombolysis cannot dissolve large pulmonary emboli. Another woman was treated for Group B Streptococcus colonisation of the genital tract in her second trimester. Sheseemed well and delivered vaginally at term. Some weekslater, she re-presented septic; her blood culture identiedGAS, but, despite antibiotics, she died in multi-organ fail-ure a few days later. There was no autopsy. It is not certain that pregnancy or delivery was the cause of this death, as it seems more probable that she suffered Table A7.2 The causes of the infections listed in Table A7.1. This includes all Direct deaths from Sepsis in Chapter 7 and Indirect deaths in Chapter 10 Organisms Number and percent of cases Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (39%) Not known 6 (17%) Total 36 (100%)Annex 7.1. A possible future approach to case denitions \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 99the same infection scenario as described in the next section where such deaths are considered Coincidental. Are these deaths Direct orIndirect ? For the GAS and pneumococcal infections that occurred some days aftervaginal or CS delivery, eight in all, it is arguable that these are community-acquired infections and that the genital tract, traumatised by delivery, was a moresusceptible substrate for entry of infection, i.e. they areIndirect. Category 4: Admitted with severe sepsis from the community, membranes intact, not in labour atonset of illness. These eleven women form a most interesting group of sep- sis patients, traditionally classied as Direct deaths from genital tract sepsis but, under the proposed new classica-tion system, are now considered to be Coincidental . Where the organism was known, it was GAS ( n= 6) and the pneumococcus ( n= 2). Eight of the women were in the third trimester, one in the rst, and two in the second.Only one was obese. Nine women presented in septic shock (GAS n=6 , pneumococcus n= 1, not known n= 2) and with meningitis (pneumococcus n= 1, CSF mixed growth n= 1). The clinical presentation was generally rapid: six of the eleven died either at home or within 24 hours' admis-sion to hospital. Eight of eleven were delivered (twothrough peri-mortem caesarean section). A typical case isdescribed below: A woman with small children nearing the end of pregnancy had a sore throat then presented very ill to hospital. DICand low platelets were identied, and pre-mortem bloodculture grew GAS. She died a few short hours after delivery. The autopsy found DIC, excluded AFE, and noted the absence of chorio-amnionitis. Sepsis was not considered in several of those admitted or there was delay in undertaking blood cultures to test for it. A woman with pneumococcus had the sickle HbSC pheno-type as a risk factor, which had not been recorded properlyin her medical notes as she was thought only to have sickletrait, HbAS. The autopsies ( n= 9) were mostly done adequately, and in two cases the positive microbiology came from autopsysamples. DIC was noted in four cases. In two others there was lack of examination of the genital tract, including the placenta, cord and membranes. Thus, in only ve of these eleven cases were there histo- pathological information on the presence or absence ofchorio-amnionitis, funisitis and endomyometritis (CAE)and, intriguingly, none indicated inflammation of the geni-tal tract. That placental cultures in some cases grew GASindicates infection in the blood but does not specify actualtissue inflammation. (In other cases outside this series, in the same taxonomic category and known to the author,there is also no CAE). This raises the question as to howthe infection gets into the mother. This scenario of preg-nancy-related sepsis, though dominated by GAS infection, is pathogenetically nothing to do with a category 3 type, classical 'Semmelweis syndrome' of direct peri-partuminfection of the genital tract. Five of the six women with GAS had a history of a 'sore throat', indicating the source of infection was from thecommunity (possibly from their other children at school).Whether the bacterium passes directly from the nasophar-ynx into the blood stream, or goes from nasopharynx to hand to vagina, ascending the genital tract into blood stream, is not clear. Both have been documented 3. If it goes via the latter route, it appears to happen so quickly that there is noinduction of inflammation in the genital tract. GAS is car-ried transiently in the vagina in a small proportion of thirdtrimester women (about 0.03% on cross-sectional studies) 4; the pneumococcus is also carried in some women5. The other important pathogenetic issue is whether women are susceptible to these overwhelming bacterialinfections by the nature of being pregnant, in any of thetrimesters. Whilst there is good evidence for a temporarycell-mediated immunosuppresssion due to pregnancy (andinfluencing the course of mycobacterial infections, someviruses, and listeriosis), there is none such for pyogenicbacterial infections. Central UK surveillance of GAS infec- tions indicate that in the 15-44 year age group, the rate of GAS bacteraemia is low at 1.5/100,000 women per year,and it is only in this age range that slightly more womenthan men acquire this infection. But there is currently nocollection of data on co-morbidities or status such as preg-nancy to provide more useful epidemiological informa-tion 6. In conclusion, it may be that in this signicant group of pregnant women who die of overwhelming sepsis, the preg- nancy per se has nothing to do with the infection, i.e. thedeaths are Coincidental . It is important that further epide- miological studies, in conjunction with better clinico-patho-logical investigations, be done to understand more about thisparticular, very concerning scenario of sepsis in pregnancy. Category 5: Post-partum sepsis directly related to delivery, but not involving the genital tract. Five women died of overwhelming infection that, in all but one, was acquired whilst in hospital care. Two of themwere neurological in origin: A woman delivered twins before term. Her blood pressure rose, but the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia was not immedi-ately recognised. Despite MgSO4, her hypertension contin-Lucas and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203ued. She complained of headache (but no seizure), and a scan showed intra-ventricular haemorrhage. An intra-ven-tricular drain was inserted, which became infected withGAS, and she died more than a week after delivery. Inter-estingly, the pathologist did a good autopsy, with neuro- pathological consultation, but missed the point that the fundamental cause of death was not classical post-partumGAS sepsis but eclampsia with unintended complications ofmanagement. The other case, counted in Chapter 8: Anaesthesia , was even more uncommon but reflects again on the necessityof strict aseptic technique. A mother had a caesearan section (CS) under spinal anaes- thesia, without evident entry-site infection, and was dis-charged a few days later. She retuned shortly after withheadache, photophobia and neck stiffness. Despite neurosur-gical relief and biopsy, she deteriorated and died. Atautopsy there was a spinal abscess and, in the cerebrum,acute haemorrhagic leukoencephalopathy (AHL). The AHLis probably related to the spinal infection (a rare auto- immune response to infection), and the spinal infection is probably related to the anaesthesia (ie the application ofOccam's razor). Two of the other cases had post-CS infection that resulted in fatal septic shock. In one case of a staphylococ- cal CS wound infection, the mother died some weeks aftera laparotomy which demonstrated peritonitis. As expected,the autopsy could contribute little to the analysis apartfrom conrming acute lung injury from shock. But it wasdecient in not examining well the intestines nor theuterus, and, bizarrely, the pregnancy and caesarean sectionfacts were omitted from the cause of death sequence. In the other case, a forensic autopsy on a patient who had had a complicated CS delivery and collapsed at home failedto identify the evident intra-abdominal source of infectionbeyond nding pus in the rectus muscle and subphrenicspace. A nal case is an example of rapidly progressing GAS infection presenting in an unusual fashion - post-deliverynipple infection and then necrotising mastitis - and not being sufciently rapidly appreciated by the GP. It is also discussed in the Sepsis, General Practice and Critical Carechapters. This has to be considered as a community-acquired infection, as it happened a few days after dis- charge home, and presumably the infection travelled fromthe oro-pharynx of the patient through a defect of the nip-ple skin, and into the blood. Thus all ve patients in this category undoubtedly had Direct death fatal sepsis: if they had not been pregnant they would not have died. Sepsis: Pathological good practice points for autopsy 1.Unless sepsis cannot be pertinent to the case (eg road trafc death), all maternal autopsies should have blood cultures taken before the body is opened; ifpre-mortem samples are available, the results mustbe accessed 2.Blood samples are taken from the neck and chestonly; any site below the umbilicus or within theopened body will be contaminated by faecal flora 3.Foci of sepsis within the body (eg uterus, lung, meninges) must also be sampled bacteriologically 4.A full set of histopathology samples, including bone marrow, will assist in determining the presence andpattern of sepsis present 7.

The recognition and management of severe, acute illness in a pregnant woman requires multidisciplinary teamwork.An anaesthetist and/or critical-care specialist should be involved early. Obstetric and gynaecology services, particularly those without an on-site critical-care unit, must have a dened localguideline to obtain rapid access to, and help from, critical-care specialists. Summary of cases for 2006-08 The central assessors in anaesthesia reviewed 127 cases inwhich anaesthetic services were involved in the care of awoman who died from either a Direct orIndirect cause of maternal death and for whom notes were available. Thiscomprised 49% (127 of 261 )of all the maternal deaths in this triennium. From these deaths the assessors identiedseven (3%) women who died from problems directly asso- ciated with anaesthesia and whose deaths are counted in this Chapter. The overall mortality rates from Direct deaths from anaesthesia over the past eight triennia are shown in Table 8.1. In addition to the seven women who died from Direct anaesthetic causes, the assessors considered that in a further18 deaths anaesthetic management contributed to the out-come or there were lessons to be learned. There were also 12 women with severe pregnancy-induced hypertension or sep- sis for whom obstetricians or or critical-care services early,which the assessors considered may have contributed to thedeaths. These deaths are counted in the relevant chapters ofthis Report, but the lessons to be learned are discussed below. Women with severe acute illness or signicant co-mor- bidity present a major challenge to obstetric, anaestheticand midwifery services, particularly when the maternity ser- vice is already stretched with peak activity in its normal workload. Many case reports highlighted the fact that pro-viding good high-dependency care was difcult when thematernity service was already very busy. Table 8.1.

Two of the seven women were obese. Failure to ventilate the lungs There were two deaths as a result of a failure to ventilate thelungs, one after induction of general anaesthesia and onewhen a tracheostomy tube came out in a critical-care ward. In the rst woman, the anaesthetist failed to stop trying to intubate the trachea even though oxygenation was mask airway (ILMA).Failed intubation guidelines 1were followed, to an extent, in this very stressful situation, but oesophageal intubation through the ILMA was not recognised and further hypoxia occurred. The woman was coughing but was not allowed towake up, and a second dose of thiopental and a long-actingneuromuscular-blocking drug were given even though theend-expiratory CO 2monitor indicated that the woman's lungs were not being ventilated. Cricothyrotomy was notattempted. Patients do not die from a 'failure to intubate'. They die either from failure to stop trying to intubate or from undiag-nosed oesophageal intubation. Bruce Scott 1986 2 Much of the success that these Condential Enquiries intoMaternal Deaths have had in reducing Direct deaths from anaesthesia has been from tackling airway-related deaths.In the 1967-69 triennial report for England and Wales 3 there were 32 such deaths. Striving for absence of such deaths is achievable, as in 1994-96, but requires continual efforts. Management of failed intubation/ventilation is acore anaesthetic skill that should be rehearsed and assessedregularly. 4The infrequent use of general anaesthesia in obstetrics, and hence the lack of experience, makes thisextremely important. 5In one region of the UK, during a 5-year period from 1999 to 2003, there was an incidence offailed tracheal intubation of one in 238 general anaethetics. In half of these women, there was a failure to follow an accepted protocol for failed tracheal intubation. 6Recent surveillance of failed tracheal conducted through the United KingdomObstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS which is discussedin detail in the Introductory Chapter of this Report)between April 2008 and January 2010 identied 51 womenin an estimated 1.4 million maternities, giving an estimated rate of failed intubation of 36 cases per million maternities (95% CI 27-48 per million maternities [personal commu-nication with UKOSS]).Human errors and failures in clinical practice are inevita- ble. Strategies and guidelines need to be in place when errorsor failures occur. 7Assessment of nontechnical skills, such as situation awareness, is given high priority in the aviationindustry but is also very important in medical practice. In anaesthesia, one must always consider the worst-case sce- nario, implement drills and be aware of what may happenunder stress. An anaesthetist may perceive failed intubationas failed performance, which creates pressure to persist.There is the added fear of acid aspiration, but the impor-tance of maternal oxygenation cannot be overemphasised. In managing a rare critical situation, it is important to be prepared to implement an accepted drill fully and to main- tain priorities. Drills should not be complex and must be practiced regularly. The anaesthetist must avoid blind alleysand the natural behaviour patterns of xation and denial. It is also pertinent to note that the woman discussed above had a working epidural in labour when it was decidedto perform a Category 2 caesarean section. Subsequentlythere was a sustained fetal bradycardia, which escalated theurgency of caesarean section to Category 1. The epidural had not been topped up to provide surgical anaesthesia for caesarean section because the anaesthetist planned to topthe epidural up in theatre. If the epidural had been toppedup when it was decided she was to have a caesarean section,general anaesthesia may not have been required. Epidural anaesthesia for operative delivery: learning points Epidural analgesia that has been working well in labour should be topped up to provide full surgical anaesthesiawithout delay once the decision for operational deliveryhas been made. If the woman cannot be immediatelytransferred to an operating theatre and full epiduralanaesthesia is established on the labour ward, the anaes- thetist and full resuscitation equipment should be imme- diately available and full 'epidural monitoring' provided. A second woman died in a critical-care unit from loss of the airway when her tracheostomy tube came out whilebeing turned. She had a known airway problem and knowndifculty with her tracheostomy. A clear strategy of management for this scenario was required in advance, including the use of small trachealtubes and quick referral for senior help out of hours.Autopsy revealed a very small larynx and lobular brown tis-sue obscured the tracheostomy orice. In these two cases, non-consultant anaesthetists were exposed to rare emergencies without immediate senior backup. Inexperience of rare situations is difcult toChapter 8: Anaesthesia 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 103address, but protocols, drills and simulated practice are known to help. Postoperative complications Four women died after complications in the postoperative period. One death was related to opiate toxicity in a woman receiving patient-controlled analgesia but the patient-con-trolled analgesia machine, the syringe and its contents werenot retained for inspection and analysis. A second deathfrom acute circulatory failure, may have been the result ofblood incompatibility after a blood transfusion. Anotherwoman died from cardiac arrest while recovering from gen-eral anaesthesia for a surgical abortion. After the event, it transpired that the woman was a regular substance abuser. She had been given Syntometrine /C210intravenously, which may have caused the cardiac arrest in a woman with cardiacirritability secondary to substance abuse. Serious incidents: learning points When a serious incident occurs, all equipment anddrugs should be retained in situ for inspection and anal- ysis until the cause of the incident is determined. The fourth woman probably aspirated gastric contents on emergence from general anaesthesia after an emergencycaesarean section. She was considered to need a Category 1caesarean section because of antepartum haemorrhage from aknown placenta praevia, but the bleeding had settled and she was cardiovascularly stable. She had eaten a full meal in hos- pital before the decision for a Category 1 caesarean section. General anaesthesia was a reasonable choice, but there was no documented discussion about whether a Category 1 cae- sarean section was actually indicated or time be allowed for the stomach to empty. Management of extubation may becritical in the presence of a full stomach. The obstetricpatient should be fully awake and able to protect her air-way before extubation. The stomach was presumed to con-tain gastric contents, and it had not been decompressedwith a wide-bore orogastric tube. 8 Full stomach: learning points When general anaesthesia is administered to a womanwith a potentially full stomach, she should be fullyawake and able to protect her airway before extubation.When a woman is known to have a full stomach, reduc-ing the gastric volume and pressure by gentle 'in and out' insertion of a wide-bore orogastric haemorrhagic disseminated leucoencephalitis wasfound at autopsy in a woman who died some days after anuneventful spinal anaesthetic for caesarean section. Autopsyalso revealed an empyema in the spinal canal covering thelumbar and lower thoracic spinal cord. Acute haemorrhagic leucoencephalitis, or Hurst's disease, is a very rare hyperacute and usually fatal form of acutedisseminated encephalomyelitis. The cause is unclear, but itmay be triggered by vaccination or infection. An autoim-mune pathology is likely, with immune cross-reactivitybetween myelin and infectious agent antigens. It was con- sidered that the spinal empyema triggered this very rare autoimmune disease. Although recognising that this was anidiosyncratic disease, it emphasises the necessity for strictasepsis when performing spinal or epidural anaesthesia. Substandard care The assessors considered that there was substandard anaes-thetic or perioperative care in six of the seven (86%) Direct anaesthetic deaths. Three had major and three had minor substandard care as dened in Chapter 1. Although sub-standard care may have been judged as present, it does notnecessarily mean that it caused the death. The cases illus-trate the need for working as part of a team and that allprofessionals should understand the risks of anaesthesia. Pathology Four deaths attributed to anaesthesia have been reviewed:two related to establishing or maintaining the airway, oneto aspiration and one to opiate toxicity. The detailedautopsy on the death from aspiration showed a failure ofthe autopsy to address the clinical issues: Inhalation of gastric contents on emergence from general anaesthesia in a nonstarved woman was suspected, withacute respiratory distress syndrome developing, leading todeath days later. The autopsy was very detailed and histol-ogy was extensive, but there was no mention of a search forinhaled gastric contents. Deaths to which anaesthesia contributed There were 18 further Direct orIndirect maternal deaths to which perioperative anaesthetic management contributed or from which lessons can be learned. These deaths are counted in the relevant chapters in this Report and dis-cussed here in the categories listed in Table 8.2. Failure to recognise serious acute illness Young, t, pregnant women have signicant physiologicalreserve, which disguises the early warning signs of illness.When a pathological process such as sepsis becomes over-McClure, Cooper 104 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203whelming, decompensation is acute and profound. It is emphasised that death in pregnancy or the puerperium can ensue within hours of sepsis becoming apparent. There were ten deaths as the result of a failure to recog- nise and manage major, acute, serious illness. Early recognition of serious acute illness in an otherwise t pregnant woman is a skill that only comes with experi-ence. Multidisciplinary assessment by senior medical staff isinvaluable if carried out before the situation becomes irre- trievable. There is evidence that early warning scoring sys- or more specic Modied Early Obstetric WarningsScoring systems are being used more frequentlyin maternity units and gynaecology wards, but they are notalways acted upon. Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia In eight of the 19 women who died of pre-eclampsia/ eclampsia, including HELLP syndrome, the anaesthetic management, or rather its lack, may have contributed tothe death. In six of these deaths, the assessors consideredthat senior advice or assistance from an anaesthetic or criti-cal-care specialist was requested too late. One woman was admitted with severe hypertension and +++ proteinuria. She was referred to a urologist in spite of beingvery unwell on admission. She required immediate controland regular, frequent monitoring of her blood pressure. Helpfrom an anaesthetist and high-dependency care could havehelped this woman from the outset but was not requested. The immediate postoperative management of women with severe pre-eclampsia/eclampsia is the responsibility ofboth the consultant obstetrician and the consultant anaes-thetist. It should be a joint decision whether care, treat-ment and monitoring are provided in a labour ward high- dependency unit or a critical-care ward. Another woman had eclamptic ts at home, in the ambu- lance and on the labour ward. She was treated with magne-sium sulphate and an intravenous bolus of labetalol. Herblood pressure dropped quickly, and she had a cardiac arrest. This woman warranted early involvement of the anaesthe- tist, high-dependency care and regular, frequent monitoringof her blood pressure. Frequent noninvasive measurementsof systolic arterial pressure are useful in monitoring a trend.Direct arterial pressure monitoring should be considered if amore accurate measurement of systolic and diastolic arterial pressures is required, particularly in the morbidly obese woman, but should not delay treatment. Severe pre-eclampsia: learning point Severe pre-eclampsia requires immediate control andregular, frequent monitoring of blood pressure withhigh-dependency care. Anaesthetic services and, on occasions, critical-care services should be involved in management at an early stage. Sepsis In six deaths from sepsis there were identiable delays in seeking senior help or advice and help from anaesthetists and critical-care specialists. One woman went to see her GP a week postpartum feeling very unwell. The GP sent her directly to the Emergency Department where she was found to be tachycardic and acidotic. There wasthen a signicant delay in asking for help with resuscitationfrom an anaesthetist or critical-care specialist. She died in acritical-care unit a few weeks after delivery. Puerperal sepsis can quickly become a life-threatening obstetric emergency. Sepsis: learning point Circulatory collapse can happen suddenly in sepsis, and management should be multidisciplinary. The management of circulatory collapse caused by sepsisincludes early administration of high-dose broad-spec-trum intravenous antibiotics, careful fluid resuscitation,inotropic support and cardiovascular monitoring in acritical-care environment.Early blood analysis, including blood culture, arterialgas and plasma lactate measurement, is also required (see Chapter 16). Surgery may be necessary to remove the source of thesepsis.Table 8.2. Categories under which Direct and Indirect deaths attributed to anaesthesia are discussed Number* Anaesthesia was a contributory factor or lesson to be learned Failure to recognise serious illness 10 Poor management of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia 8 Poor management of sepsis 6 Poor management of postpartum haemorrhage 5 Poor management of haemorrhage in early pregnancy 5 Others Failure to consult with an anaesthetist or critical-care specialist contributory factor.Chapter from obstetric haemorrhage represent a substantial decline from the 14 deaths reported in 2003-05.The management of both expected major haemorrhage inwomen with known placenta accreta and unexpected exces- sive intraoperative blood loss has also improved. 9However, there is evidence of poor postpartum care in which contin-ued bleeding went unrecognised in the immediate postpar-tum period, and perioperative care by anaesthetistscontributed. Skin colour and morbid obesity present majorchallenges in both diagnosis and management of hypovola-emia. The deaths of ve women who died from postpartum haemorrhage were assessed. Of these: two women had emergency caesarean sections one woman suffered an inverted uterus one woman had a secondary postpartum haemorrhage with sepsis a number of weeks after a difcult caesareansection. She was admitted to a hospital without acritical-care unit for evacuation of the products of con-ception one woman who refused blood on religious grounds diedfrom perineal bleeding after an instrumental delivery. In these cases there was evidence of a lack of apprecia- tion of the risk of postpartum haemorrhage and failure touse high-dependency care. One woman underwent a difcult caesarean section with a blood loss of more than one litre. The epidural anaestheticwas converted to a general anaesthetic because of painwhen the uterus was exteriorised. She was receiving a Synt-ocinon /C210infusion. A blood transfusion was prescribed and hourly urine measurements were requested, and sheappeared comfortable because of epidural morphine. How- ever, she did not have regular postoperative observations and died of a postpartum haemorrhage. There was a lack of appreciation of the risk of postpar- tum haemorrhage, which was not diagnosed because of a lack of monitoring in the early postpartum period. An obese woman with pre-eclampsia treated with labetalol and methyl dopa had a caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia. She died of a postpartum haemorrhage. There was failure to recognise hypovolaemia secondary to bloodloss because of pre-eclampsia and b-blockade. The signs of hypovolaemia further modied skincolour and epidural Continuing concealed intra-abdominal haemorrhage may go unnoticed in postnatal wards, but signs of ongoinghaemorrhage were also missed in labour ward high-depen-dency units. This may reflect a manpower or training issue,but MEOWS systems can only help if they trigger a response. Haemorrhage in early pregnancy Poor anaesthetic care contributed to the deaths of ve women who died from haemorrhage in early pregnancy. These cases are counted as early pregnancy deaths in Chap-ter 6. Two women died of postoperative haemorrhage after surgical evacuation of the uterus in early pregnancy, both ofwhom had at least two previous caesarean sections; one wasknown to have a low-lying placenta. Three further womendied from haemorrhage in early pregnancy and their anaes- thetic management was considered to be less than optimal. All of these women were managed by gynaecological ser-vices where there was failure to recognise the severity ofhaemorrhage or anaemia, failure to quickly control thehaemorrhage surgically and/or resuscitate under full moni-toring in an operating theatre. In one case: A woman who underwent surgical evacuation of the uterus but actually had an ectopic pregnancy died several hourspostoperatively from intra-abdominal bleeding. No routineobservations were made overnight. This woman had been anaesthetised before the operating surgeon had met her, and the opportunity to establish thatabdominal pain was a relevant presenting complaint wasmissed. Haemorrhage: learning points Women known to be at risk of major haemorrhage,e.g. women with placenta accreta or who declineblood and blood products, should be delivered inmajor maternity units with access to critical care, in-terventional radiology and cell salvage. Circulatory collapse can happen suddenly in haem- orrhage, and management should be multidisciplin- ary. The management of circulatory collapse due tohaemorrhage includes surgery, intravenous fluid,blood and blood products and cardiovascular moni-toring. Fluid resuscitation and inotropic supportshould be used cautiously before surgical control ofthe haemorrhage. The symptoms and signs of hypovolaemia are difcult to recognise if there is any of the following: language difculty obesity pre-eclampsia brown/black skin b-blockade.McClure, Cooper Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203Chronic illness or co-morbidity Pregnancy and childbirth are promoted as normal events, but maternity services are increasingly seeing older womenwith signicant co-morbidity becoming pregnant. Theassessors for this triennium saw many examples of good care of such women where they had been referred to high- risk multidisciplinary and anaesthetic clinics early, forexample: A woman who had a heart transplant was successfully delivered by caesarean section under general anaesthesia in a cardiac theatre by a multidisciplinary team with fullmonitoring and inotropic support. Unfortunately, she diedof vascular rejection some weeks after delivery. However, there were also examples of lack of forward planning: A woman with severe liver disease had an emergency cae- sarean section in her local maternity unit under general anaesthesia early in her third trimester because of fetaldistress. She was admitted to a critical-care bed postpar-tum but collapsed a few days after delivery because ofintra-abdominal bleeding. She continued to bleed and waseventually transferred to a specialist liver unit but diedthere. This high-risk woman required full multidisciplinary care from the outset and should have been delivered in amaternity unit able to provide specialist liver advice andmanagement. This is a lesson that again needs to be high- lighted. Failure to consult with an anaesthetist or critical-care spe- cialist early There were 12 deaths where referral to an anaesthetist or a critical-care specialist happened too late and supportiveorgan therapy was delayed. Anaesthetists were often notinformed of women admitted with signicant pre-eclamp- sia or sepsis because trainees in obstetrics and gynaecology did not appreciate how ill they were. Formal consultations from critical-care specialists should be encouraged before critical care is actually required.There was evidence that in consultant-led obstetric andgynaecology services without on-site critical-care beds,there was delay advice and on-site fromcritical-care specialists. Obesity Venous cannulation of the morbidly obese may present achallenge and should not be undertaken by those with littleexperience because of the risk of failure and making subse-quent attempts much more difcult. Familiarity with spe-cial beds for the morbidly obese is necessary in case awoman needs to be laid flat for resuscitation. The Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries and the Royal College ofObstetricians and Gynaecologists have recently publishedclinical guidelines for the management of obese women inpregnancy and childbirth. 10 Anaphylaxis A woman died after suffering an unexpected acute anaphy-lactic reaction to an antibiotic given during labour. She was not known to be allergic before this. The failure to initiate perimortem caesarean section on the labour ward within 4 minutes of cardiac arrest to deliver the fetus, may have contributed to the unsuccessful mater- nal resuscitation. 11Acute anaphylaxis requires an immedi- ate medical response including treatment with adrenaline.A formal anaphylaxis protocol, 12similar to a cardiopulmo- nary resuscitation chart, should be immediately availablefor all clinical staff to follow. These charts are already avail-able in every operating theatre. 13 Anaphylaxis: learning point Acute anaphylaxis management charts should be imme-diately available in all clinical areas. Thromboprophylaxis A woman had an uneventful emergency caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia but died from a pulmonary embolism a few weeks later. Thromboprophylaxis wasgiven in too low a dose and was started too late. Theremoval of the epidural catheter was inexplicably delayed,resulting in a subsequent delay in initiating thrombo-prophylaxis. This may have been contributory in thishigh-risk woman. Thromboprophylaxis guidelines after caesarean section 14 recommend the rst dose of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) be given 4 hours after spinal or epidural anaes-thesia is established or after removal of an epidural catheterto reduce the risk of a spinal canal haematoma. Epidural catheter removal should be timed to avoid delay in giving LMWH. If the epidural catheter is to remain in situ for fur- ther potential surgery or postpartum analgesia, it should beremoved 12 hours after a dose of LMWH and 4 hoursbefore the next dose. The rst dose of LMWH should not be delayed without good reason, e.g. coagulopathy, high risk of postpartumhaemorrhage or a traumatic, bloody epidural/spinal proce- dure.Chapter 1), 1-203 107Workload A number of case reports highlight that peak labour ward activity coincided with the emergency admission of a preg-nant woman with an acute, severe illness. Many notes sug-gest that the midwifery, obstetric and anaesthetic workforce was already fully committed at times of peak activity in normal workload. This produces difculties if a pregnantwoman with an acute, severe illness is admitted andrequires high-dependency care in addition. When stafnglevels are calculated on average activity, there needs to be aclear contingency plan for all disciplines to obtain furtherskilled assistance. Workload: learning point A clear contingency plan to provide additional skilledassistance should be in place if maternity staff arealready fully committed at times of peak activity, if awoman with an acute, severe illness requires high-dependency care. Serious incidents and hospital enquiries Most maternal deaths within hospital now initiate a fullserious incident or internal hospital enquiry, the reports ofwhich were available to the Regional and Central Assessors. These reports are still of variable quality and clearly com- pleted in-house and therefore open to bias. Hospital man-agers are again asked to consider whether unbiased externalinput would assist in this process and ensure greater objec-tivity.

Cardiac disease: specic recommendation Women with a known history of cardiac disease must be referred for consultant-led obstetric care in a maternity unit where there is a joint obstetric/cardiology clinic or a cardiologist with expertise in the care of women with heart dis- ease in pregnancy. Cardiac disease: learning points There must be a low threshold for further investigationof pregnant or recently delivered women who complainof chest pain that is severe, or radiates to the neck, jawor back, or is associated with other features such as agi-tation, vomiting or breathlessness, tachycardia, tachyp-noea, orthopnea or acidosis. This is especially important for women who smoke, are obese or who have hyper- tension. Appropriate investigations to rule out, orconrm, cardiac disease or aortic dissection includean electrocardiogram (ECG), a chest X-ray, cardiacenzymes (Troponin), an echocardiogram and computedtomography pulmonary angiography.Women with or epigastric pain severeenough to require opiate analgesia must be fully investi- gated for all possible causes, including cardiac disease. Wheezing can be a feature of pulmonary oedema as wellas asthma. Pulmonary oedema requires investigationwith a chest X-ray and an echocardiogram and oxygensaturation.Arterial blood gases are frequently measured wheninvestigating suspected pulmonary embolus and mayalso provide important information about underlying cardiac disease. Hypoxaemia is a feature of pulmonary oedema, and a metabolic acidosis (increased base excess,reduced bicarbonate), with or without an elevated serumlactate, is a feature of a reduced cardiac output second- ary to cardiac disease.The curriculum and training of obstetricians followingthe advanced training skills module in maternal medi- cine and maternal and fetal medicine subspecialisation should reflect the importance of heart disease as a causeof maternal death. Such training should equip theobstetrician with knowledge of when and which womenwith pre-existing or new onset heart disease to refer tospecialists. Introduction The deaths of 53 women who died from heart disease associ-ated with, or aggravated by, pregnancy were reported to theEnquiry in 2006-08. These are classied as Indirect maternal deaths. This gives a maternal mortality rate for cardiac dis- ease for 2006-08 of 2.31 per 100 000 maternities (95% CI1.77-3.03) compared with 2.27 and 2.20 per 100 000 mater-nities (95% CIs 1.67-2.96 and 1.64-2.96, respectively, for theprevious two triennia as shown in Table 9.1. It therefore remains not only the commonest cause of Indirect maternal death but the commonest cause overall. In addition to these women, lessons arising from eight other women known to the Enquiry who died from cardiac disease later after delivery are discussed and consideredhere, although they are counted as Late deaths in Chapter 12. Of these, there were six Late Indirect cardiac deathsChapter 9: Cardiac disease \u00aa2011 Centre for to secondary to from dilated that could have beenperipartum cardiomyopathy or secondary to thyrotoxicosis.There were two Late Coincidental deaths in intravenous drug users because of infective endocarditis. Three other maternal deaths to which cardiac disease con- tributed are counted and considered in other Chapters. One associated with ischaemic cardiac disease in early pregnancyis counted in Chapter 6, one with myocardial scarring fromcocaine use is counted in Chapter 8, and one from secondaryacute endocarditis is counted in Chapter 10. Summary of key ndings: 2006-08 Table 9.2 shows the overall numbers of cardiac maternal deaths by major cause for this, and previous, triennia. Theleading causes are sudden adult death syndrome (SADS),of which there has been a signicant increase; myocardialinfarction, mostly related to from pul-monary hypertension and from congenital heart disease continue to decrease. There were no deaths from rheumatic heart disease in the current triennium. Thirty of the 50 (60%) women who died from cardiac disease and for whom a body mass index (BMI) was avail-able were overweight or obese. Half of them had a BMI of30 or more. The assessors considered that some degree of substan- dard care was present in 27 of the 53 (51%) deaths counted in this Chapter. In 13 deaths, there were major les- sons to be learnt, and, if the care had been better, the out-come may have been different. For 14 women, the care they received was less than optimal and lessons can be learnt from their management, but the outcome wouldhave been inevitable. The varying reasons for this are dis-cussed throughout this Chapter. Congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension The deaths of four women who died from the complica- tions of congenital heart disease or from pulmonaryvascular disease are counted in this Chapter, and onewoman whose cardiac disease complicated her pregnancy iscounted in Chapter 4. One died following heart transplan-tation, one from a thrombosed aortic valve and two frompulmonary hypertension. Of these latter two, one wasprobably the result of complications associated with an atrial septal defect. Even though these mothers' deaths could not have been prevented, care was considered suboptimal in somewomen. This was because of a lack of pre-pregnancy coun-selling, failure to refer to the cardiologists, a lack ofcommunication between specialists and inappropriate man-agement of anticoagulation. Maternal morbidity from pulmonary vascular disease Over the 4-year period between March 2006 and February 2010, 24 conrmed cases of pulmonary vascular diseasewere reported through the United Kingdom Obstetric Sur-veillance System (UKOSS; Detailed information on theUKOSS is given in the Introductory Chapter to thisreport), giving an estimated incidence of 0.8 (95% CI 0.5- 1.2) per 100 000 maternities. 1Eleven were due to the result of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, and nineTable 9.1.

There were two related to chronic thromboembolism, one to sleep apnoea and one to connective tissue disease. Fourteen cases wereknown before pregnancy and ten were diagnosed duringpregnancy. Acquired heart disease Myocardial infarction and ischaemic heart disease Eleven women died from acute myocardial infarction (MI)or chronic ischaemic heart disease (IHD), a rate 0.48(95% CI 0.27-0.87) per 100 000 maternities compared withthe 16 whose deaths were considered in the last Report, arate of 0.76 (95% CI 0.46-1.2) per 100 000 maternities.Coronary atheroma was the underlying pathology in threeof the six women who died from MI; one of these deathswas the result of extensive coronary artery dissection, a recognised complication of pregnancy and in the two other women the cause of death was undetermined. There werealso ve deaths from IHD where no acute MI was demon-strated. Presumably death in these women related toarrhythmia or heart failure. In total, eight women died fromIHD compared with 12 in the previous triennium. The women who died Again, as shown in the last Report, the impact of lifestylefactors such as increasing maternal age, obesity and smok-ing was dramatic, and all of the women who died had iden- tiable risk factors. The mothers' ages ranged from 28 to 46 years with a median of 36 years. Eight women were 35or older, of whom ve were aged 40 years or more. All wereparous, and seven were para 4 or greater, of whom twowere of extremely high parity. Six smoked, four had knownhypertension, four were overweight and three were obese.Two had a family history of cardiac disease, one had hyper-cholesterolaemia, one had gestational diabetes and one had sickle cell disease. Three women were from black and minority ethnic groups. Three mothers also had social prob-lems: two were known to the child protection services, oneof whom had also reported domestic violence, and anotherwoman abused cannabis and alcohol. All but two of these women died postnatally, although one had collapsed antenatally near term. Maternal morbidity from acute myocardial infarction The UKOSS study of acute MI in pregnancy, undertaken between August 2005 and February 2010,1identied 23 conrmed nonfatal cases occurring antenatally, giving anestimated 0.7 (95% CI 0.4-1.0) cases per100 000 maternities. Fourteen of the women with a con-rmed MI had angiography: seven had coronary ather- oma, three had coronary artery dissection, two had coronary arterial thrombosis and two had normal coro-Table 9.2.

In view of the increasing prevalence of risk factors for IHD among women delivering in the UK andthe mortality noted in this report, this is likely to repre-sent an underestimate of the true underlying burden ofnonfatal disease. An additional 17 cases were reported that did not meet the criteria for MI during pregnancy, including four women with a postnatal MI, one womanwhose MI occurred pre-pregnancy and two women withsevere angina. Quality of care Care was considered substandard in ve of the 11 deaths(46%). As in the last Report, failure to consider acute coro- nary syndrome (MI, which is subdivided into ST elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] and non-STEMI) as a causeof chest pain\u2014i.e. neck pain, jaw pain, left arm pain, nau-sea or dizziness in women with risk factors\u2014was arepeated nding, and this led to a failure to performappropriate investigations. For example: A woman who smoked presented to the Emergency Depart- ment with chest pain and breathlessness some weeks afterdelivery. Acute coronary syndrome was not considered inthe differential diagnosis, possibly in view of a normalECG, her age and the quality of the pain. Serial ECGs andTroponin were not requested, and, even though the working diagnosis was pulmonary embolus, a V/Q scan was not per- formed. She was discharged from the Clinical Decision Unitand died shortly afterwards. Another woman with risk factors for IHD presented during pregnancy with chest pain. An ECG showed clear changesof ischaemia, and the Troponin level was raised. However,a normal echocardiogram falsely reassured the cardiologists, who did not investigate her symptoms further. Some days later she complained of heartburn, vomiting and dizzinessand died of myocardial ischaemia. ECGs can be normal between bouts of angina or chest pain. Therefore, a single normal ECG does not excludeischaemia, and serial ECGs and Troponin should form partof the investigations for chest pain. Although the absenceof regional wall abnormality on an echocardiogramexcludes a full thickness STEMI, a normal echocardiogramdoes not exclude non-STEMI. It is possible that the cardi-ologists were reluctant to perform a coronary angiogram because of the pregnancy. Myocardial infarction and ischaemic heart disease: learning points Ischaemic heart disease has now become a common car- diac cause of death in pregnancy.Current trends in lifestyle factors, including smoking, and increasing age at childbirth, are likely to be contrib- uting to this increase in incidence. All the women whodied had identiable risk factors including: obesity age >35 years parity >3 smoking diabetes pre-existing hypertension family history. Myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome canpresent with atypical features in pregnancy such asabdominal or epigastric pain and vomiting or dizziness.A single normal ECG does not exclude ischaemia, espe-cially if performed when the woman is pain-free. Thereshould be a low threshold for further investigation (such as serial ECGs and Troponin) of ischaemic-sounding chest pain, especially in women with known risk factors.There should also be a low threshold for emergency coro-nary intervention (coronary angiogram with angioplastywith or without stenting), which will allow treatment ofboth acute atheromatous coronary occlusion and the lesscommon coronary artery dissection with stenting. Aortic dissection Aortic dissection was, again, another major cause of cardiacdeath. Seven women died from aortic dissection comparedwith nine and seven in the two previous triennia, respec-tively. The ages of the women ranged between 26 and 38 years with a median of 34 years. The majority of moth- ers died within a few days after childbirth, although onehad suffered the dissection in late pregnancy, and the oth-ers during their third trimester. Two were overweight, andanother two were obese. The dissection was type A(ascending aorta) in ve women and type B (descendingaorta) in two. One woman had Ehlers-Danlos syndrometype IV with some features of Marfan syndrome, one had a bicuspid aortic valve and another had a family history of dissection. Other risk factors included pre-eclampsia, twinsand hypertension. Care was substandard in ve of the seven women (71%). In four there was failure to investigate chest pain. Forexample: A woman presented during pregnancy with what was thought to be gastritis because of vomiting and diarrhoea.She also described constant sternal pain for which sherequired opiate analgesia, but, despite the severity of thepain, no further investigations were undertaken. A few days later, after delivery, she complained of dizziness, was found to be anaemic and was transfused, again without anNelson-Piercy 112 \u00aa2011 Centre Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203underlying diagnosis being made. She then complained of chest tightness and collapsed with an asystolic arrest, pre-sumably when the dissection she had suffered late in preg-nancy extended. Another woman who complained of sudden onset chest pain was not investigated further or referred to a physician.After delivery, she was nursed in a low-dependency areadespite severe ongoing symptoms, and the midwife noted adelay of more than 2 hours before medical staff attended to reassess her after her condition had deteriorated. Her cardio- megaly was missed on the chest X-ray, and, despite the rec-ommendations in the last Report, a woman with severechest pain caused by dissection was given repeated doses ofopiates without further urgent investigation. As recommended in several earlier Reports, and reinforced here, chest pain severe enough to require opiate analgesiamandates further investigation for an underlying cause. Aortic dissection: learning points Not all chest pain in pregnancy is the result of pulmo-nary emboli.Aortic dissection is a rare but potentially fatal cause ofchest or interscapular pain in pregnancy, particularly in the presence of systolic hypertension, and must be con- sidered as part of the differential diagnosis of chestpain.Women with Marfan syndrome are at high risk of aorticdissection, but previously apparently normal pregnantwomen may also suffer this complication, most com-monly at or near term, or postnatally.Women with severe chest or abdominal pain requiring opiate analgesia must be investigated. Appropriate imaging includes a computed tomography chest scanor magnetic resonance imaging, or a transthoracic ortransoesophageal echocardiogram. Other acquired cardiac disease Cardiomyopathy Thirteen women died from cardiomyopathy. In six of themthis was attributed to peripartum cardiomyopathy, and afurther three deaths were stated to have been the result ofdilated cardiomyopathy where the diagnosis could have been peripartum cardiomyopathy. In addition to these nine probable deaths from peripartum cardiomyopathy, fourother women died from cardiomyopathy from another right ventricularcardiomyopathy (ARVC). Risk factors included pre- eclampsia, obesity and hypertension. An additional six women are classied as having died of Late Indirect peripartum cardiomyopathy some weeks after delivery. These deaths are counted in Chapter 12. Although these women are classied as Late deaths, two presented antenatally with a known diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, oneshortly after delivery and the other three several weekspostpartum. Two died from cardiomyopathy related toacute immune diseases, and another suffered a dilated car-diomyopathy secondary to chemotherapy. There was onefurther Late death from ARVC. It is important to remember that peripartum cardiomy- opathy may present up to 5-6 months postpartum but is still directly related to the pregnancy. Similarly, it maypresent antenatally or in the puerperium, but death mayoccur many months later. A recent US study 2of over 14 million pregnancy hospi- talisations in 2004-06, found a prevalence of hospitalisa-tions with of 0.46 per 1000 deliveries (0.18for apparent peripartum cardiomyopathy and 0.28 for other cardiomyopathies). The women who died The age range of the women who died was between 17 and 38 years with a median of 26 years. Ten of the 11 women,nine Indirect and two Late, who died of denite or proba- ble peripartum cardiomyopathy were parous. Five womenwere overweight, of whom one was obese. Of these 11 women, four presented antenatally, three in the third tri- mester and one who died in early pregnancy and who hadhad another child only a few months earlier. Most women had risk factors, including two with previ- ous peripartum cardiomyopathy. Three were over the ageof 35, ve had hypertension (pre-existing, pregnancy-induced hypertension or pre-eclampsia), six were smokersand three were from Black ethnic backgrounds. In total, the assessors regarded the care of seven of the 13 (54%) women who died from cardiomyopathy as sub-standard. For example: A woman with a previous history of peripartum cardiomy- opathy was not counselled by her cardiologists about the risk of recurrence. In her next pregnancy, despite numerousmentions of palpitations, she was not referred back to a car-diologist. When she was eventually referred as a matter ofurgency, near term, the consultant cardiologist refused tosee her and said in the maternal death reporting form thatthe obstetric registrar did not mention the previous left ven-tricular dysfunction. She then self-referred to an Emergency Department, where she was eventually seen by a cardiology registrar. The registrar misinterpreted the echocardiogramas showing no signicant dysfunction, not realising that aChapter 9: Cardiac disease \u00aa2011 Centre for in late preg- nancy. A consultant cardiologist who reviewed the echocar-diogram after her death said it showed 'at least moderate'left ventricular dysfunction. A young woman who booked very late, and was a smoker, complained of breathlessness in the third trimester, whichher obstetrician assumed to be the result of anaemia. Shewas also very breathless, tachypnoeic and tachycardic whenshe presented a few weeks later in preterm labour. When shewas examined, her wheeze was not recognised as a possiblesign of pulmonary oedema and no investigations wereundertaken nor any thought given to alternative diagnoses other than chest infection. All attention was focused on the management of her labour, despite the fact that sheremained tachycardic and tachypnoeic. Following a periodof loss of consciousness, arterial blood gases were measured,but the very abnormal base excess was not recognised ornoticed or appreciated as abnormal or signicant. She deliv-ered normally and then collapsed, but this was a gradualdemise as the result of worsening acidosis and unrecognised heart failure. Autopsy showed a large heart. Women with known cardiomyopathy need pre-preg- nancy counselling about the risk of recurrence/deteriora-tion. It is crucial to refer women with previous cardiomyopathy to specialist units with joint clinics where both the obstetricians and cardiologists are familiar withthe expected changes of pregnancy. These mothers needserial echocardiograms in pregnancy, especially if theirbaseline echocardiograms in early pregnancy are abnormal. In some women who died from cardiomyopathy, there was a failure to diagnose pulmonary oedema, failure tomonitor women in a high-dependency area, failure to repeat echocardiograms and failure to provide a cardiac review to women who should have had one. There weredelays recognising worsening heart failure postpartum. Inseveral women, symptoms and signs were wrongly attrib-uted to asthma (because of wheeze), anaemia, panic attacksor chest infection. Missing pulmonary oedema and missing acidosis because of ignoring tachypnoea and a large base excess are common mistakes in maternal cardiac deaths. Peripartum cardiomyopathy: learning points Women in late pregnancy or within 6 months of delivery with symptoms of breathlessness, oedema or orthopnoea and the signs of tachypnoea and tachycardia may have peripartum cardiomyopathy, and investigation with achest X-ray and an echocardiogram are indicated.Women with peripartum cardiomyopathy should be managed by cardiologists with expertise in this condi- tion and their care should be discussed, if appropriate,with the regional cardiac transplant centre.Women with pre-existing cardiomyopathy of whateverorigin must, like all women with heart disease, haveexpert and informed pre-pregnancy counselling. Deaths from other causes Four women died from myocarditis. In two women themyocarditis was thought to be viral and in one it wasrelated to an autoimmune disease. In a case of essentialhypertension: A morbidly obese woman who lived between several coun- tries booked late despite a very poor obstetric history andknown hypertension. She was poorly compliant with hermedications as well as attending for care. She only had two antenatal visits, neither of which was in a hospital antena- tal clinic. Her antihypertensive medications were changedby doctors in different countries. She collapsed and died inher third trimester after coughing up blood and foaming atthe mouth. The autopsy was substandard, but her heartwas dilated. In this context of poorly controlled severehypertension, the likely diagnosis was of 'flash' pulmonaryoedema and hypertensive heart failure, perhaps related to diastolic dysfunction. This difcult case represents many of the challenges fac- ing those who work in maternity services. This mother wasextremely high risk, highly mobile and difcult to engage in care. It highlights the need for every effort to be made to ensure that women at risk are assessed urgently by anobstetrician providing care for high-risk mothers and thattheir hypertension is controlled, if necessary by admissionto hospital. Infective endocarditis Two women died from infective endocarditis, and a further two died Late Coincidental deaths much later after delivery. All were known to abuse drugs, three of the four intrave-nously. In one woman the organism was a staphylococcus , in one it was Streptococcus mutans , in one it was a Gram- positive coccus and in the fourth no organism was identi-ed. The following is a representative case: A known intravenous drug user presented to the Emergency Department with a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT)during pregnancy. She was allowed home after promising toreturn but did not do so until a week later with worseningsymptoms. She was not admitted but referred to an outpa- tient DVT clinic, and the results of her arterial blood gases, showing acidosis and increased lactate, were missed. SheNelson-Piercy 114 \u00aa2011 Centre Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203returned later the same day with chest pain and eventually was diagnosed as having sepsis and infective endocarditis,from which she died. Her autopsy showed tricuspid valvevegetations caused by a Gram-positive coccus, but no men-tion was made of a DVT. A pregnant intravenous drug user in these circumstances should have been admitted to establish the presumed diag-nosis of DVT and to commence treatment. Arterial bloodgases are performed when looking for hypoxia if monary embolism is suspected, but a metabolic acidosis signies underlying pathology and should raise the suspi-cion of underlying sepsis. Thrombosed mechanical valves Two women died from thrombosed mechanical valves, arare cause of cardiac death. One was a known intrave-nous drug user and the other had a congenital cardiac condition. Both women were converted to low-molecu- lar-weight heparin (LMWH) in their pregnancies, andthere were issues with compliance. Recent data highlightthe importance of adequate doses of LMWH and theneed for good compliance and anti-Xa monitoring whenmanaging women with mechanical heart valves inpregnancy. 3 Sudden adult/arrhythmic death syndrome The deaths of ten women who died from SADS are dis-cussed from a pathological point of view in the Annex tothis Chapter on the pathological overview of maternaldeaths. This is because SADS is a pathological diagnosisand extra attention needs to be paid to these women giventhe rise in the number of deaths from this cause in this tri-ennium. Conclusion Deaths from heart disease remain the leading cause ofmaternal death. The commonest causes are cardiomyopa-thy, myocardial infarction/ischaemic heart disease and aor- tic dissection. Regrettably, clinicians are still failing toconsider heart disease as a possible cause for symptomsand signs in pregnancy and therefore fail to perform theappropriate investigations. Some women with known heart disease before pregnancy are not offered or referred to appropriate multidisciplinary care in specialist units.

Email: sebastian.lucas@kcl.ac.uk Cardiac deaths: pathology good practice points Do the heart examination well, with full dissection of the coronary arteries, accurate weight of the heart, measurement of the ventricle thicknesses and carefulevaluation of the valves. Correlate these data with the woman's body weight and body mass index (BMI). Do histology on a standard mid-horizontal slice of heart muscle, to examine the right and left ventricles. Look at the lung histopathology for clues (e.g. pul- monary hypertension). Retain a blood sample in case cocaine and other stimulant drug analysis is necessary. Consider consulting a cardiac pathologist to gain advice and support for the diagnosis. If the diagnosis is going to be SADS, make sure all other reasonable cardiac diagnoses, as well as preg-nancy-related diagnoses (such as amniotic fluid embolism), are excluded. If SADS or a standard cardiomyopathy seems to be the diagnosis, retain a sample of frozen spleen forpossible later genetic evaluation; the coroner will notbe expected to resource such investigations, but theNHS cardiac genetic clinics will. The main trends in cardiovascular pathology for this trien- nium are the reduction in deaths associated with congenitalheart disease and the apparent rise in incidence ofSADS. This is better described as sudden arrhythmic death syndrome where unexpected and unpredicted cardiac arrest occurs and it is discussed later. Cardiac pathology is what pathologists should do well, as it is the commonest scenario of death they encounter in routine practice in the UK. Broadly, for coronary ischaemicheart disease, infective endocarditis, pulmonary hyperten- sion and congenital heart disease and for dissection ofaorta and other vessels, this was true in the maternal deathsreviewed this triennium. But it was not the case for dif-cult, non-obvious cases where acute cardiac failure was thescenario. Ischaemic heart disease In the deaths examined, the usual patterns were seen ofcoronary artery atheroma, with or without acute thrombo-sis, and cardiac muscle damage, as either acute infarctionor chronic brotic ischaemic damage. Two women had different specic causes of coronary artery occlusion. One had postpartum dissection of the left anterior coronary artery causing myocardial infarction. It isremarkable that pregnancy is the major risk factor for suchdissection, albeit uncommon. It is presumed that thehormonal effect on arterial muscle tone interacts on anin-built medial damage to cause it. From the practical per-spective, pathologists should note that, without very closegross inspection, a dissection of a coronary artery can look very like an acute thrombosis; histology is useful here to conrm the process. The other woman was an adolescent who presented sev- eral months after pregnancy with myocardial infarction.The aetiology was a rare autoimmune disease (Kawasakidisease) with vasculitis of the coronary arteries and second-ary stenosis and occlusion. Dissection of the aorta The seven women who died from dissection of the aorta hadautopsies. Not surprisingly, most were well done, althoughthree reports had no height or weight (therefore no autopsyBMI was calculable). Although the gross pathology is self-evident, it is arguable whether histopathology is required toLucas 116 Centre and Child Enquiries degener- ation, but best practice is that it should be done. Moreimportant are co-pathologies relevant to the nal dissection:two of the seven women had clinical pre-eclampsia, but therenal histopathology (glomerular endotheliosis) was not documented to conrm this. None of the autopsy reports indicated whether genetic studies of the brillin connective tissue gene were per-formed to demonstrate Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos syn-dromes if they had not already been evaluated. Essentially,in the age-range of pregnant women with dissection ofthe aorta, the pathogeneses three-fold: inherited con-nective valve association (no brillin abnormality); and idiopathic. Best practice is to reserve spleen material in the freezer forlater DNA studies in all women with dissection of theaorta who have normal aortic valves. Importantly, it isnot for coroners' and scals' local authorities to fundsuch studies of potentially inheritable disease, it is for theNHS. Myocarditis and systemic lupus erythematosus In the women for whom an autopsy took place, the actual aetiology of the myocarditis was not established.The causes include infection (usually enteroviral), drugallergy (e.g. antibiotics), named immunopathological con-ditions such as eosinophilic or giant cell myocarditis and sarcoidosis, and idiopathic. Inevitably, there is potential for overlap with peripartum cardiomyopathy, because insome of those cases there is a myocarditis, and the clini-cal and pathological case denitions need to be closelyobserved. For myocarditis pathology, the Dallas criteriaapply: chronic inflammation (T-cell) in the myocardiumwith active destruction of myobres, i.e. not just aninterstitial inflammation which can happen in many sys- temic inflammatory response states. A further difculty for pathologists is that the diagnosis of myocarditis isnot usually entertained until the xed tissue histopathol-ogy is available, by which time the opportunity for tak-ing unxed heart and blood samples for virology andserodiagnosis is usually lost. Perhaps polymerase chainreaction technology will become more available for theretrospective diagnosis of viral myocarditis on xed tis- sue. Peripartum and other cardiomyopathies This is a confusing area of cardiac pathology, where only a full cardiac examination protocol, in conjunction with clin-ical data and family history, will produce the correct diag-noses. Of the non-peripartum cardiomyopathies (PPCM), two were arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy(ARVCM). There is no known aetiological association ofARVCM, which is partly inherited, with pregnancy. Onewoman with myotonic dystrophy died of heart failure immediately postpartum; again only an experienced cardiac pathologist can really interpret the positive and negativendings. Only six of the nine women who died from PPCM had an autopsy. The case denition of PPCM is the onset ofleft ventricular systolic dysfunction and symptoms of heartfailure during the last month of pregnancy or the rst5 months postpartum. Sudden unexpected cardiac death without previous heart failure is usually excluded. There are characteristic features pathologically\u2014enlarged heart,dilated absence of an alternative diagnosis. This is ahigh-stringency denition and for autopsy pathologists pre-sents the problem of how far to investigate cases of acuteor chronic heart failure during and after pregnancy, to sup- port or exclude a clinical diagnosis of PPCM. In two autopsies, the pathologists referred the case to a cardiac pathologist for opinion, and drug screens (mainlyfor stimulant drugs such as cocaine) were performed inanother two. One pathologist evidently had never heard ofthe entity and, following a good autopsy that clearly sup-ported PPCM, declared the 'cause of the cardiac enlarge-ment and failure' to be 'obscure'. The pathogenesis of PPCM unknown, although a non- infective pregnancy-associated immune activation myocar-ditis with destruction of myobres is the current leadinghypothesis. 1The role of cardiac biopsy in diagnosing and managing possible PPCM is underdeveloped; none of thenine women in this triennium had one, although in mostcases there was the opportunity in hospitalised women toattempt it. Sudden adult/arrhythmic death syndrome Ten women died of SADS during this triennium compared with three in the last Report. This is greater than in anyprevious Report. Six of them were obese, with bookingBMI ranging from 30 to 45. The case denition for SADS is a sudden unexpected cardiac death (i.e. presumed fatal arrhythmia) where allother causes of sudden collapse are excluded, including adrug screen for stimulant drugs such as cocaine. Theseare exacting criteria. The UK Cardiac Pathology Network(www.cpn.org.uk) is encouraging fuller autopsy examina-tions (and reporting to a central database) and provides acomprehensive list of possible diagnoses for sudden car-Annex 9.1: Pathological overview of cardiac deaths \u00aa2011 Centre Child Enquiries (CMACE), degener-ation) in causation. The classication is divided intothose where the death is explained on gross and histologi-cal criteria and those where it remains unexplained at our current state of knowledge. PPCM, ARVCM, myocarditis, left ventricular hypertrophy and are 'explained'; unexplained cardiac death inepilepsy, alcohol abuse, obesity and diabetes are 'unex-plained'. Under the SADS label come those unexplained cases with a morphologically normal heart by gross examinationand histology. A proportion can be demonstrated by elect- rographic examination of relatives (and sometimes of the woman before death) to have a conduction defect, a chan-nelopathy, e.g. long QT syndrome. In this triennium, nodeaths were ascribed to a specic arrhythmia, but thatprobably reflects the imperfect evaluation of them. SADS, cardiac hypertrophy and obesity in pregnancy This is the area of cardiac death evaluated least well histori- cally. In Chapters 10 and 17, the sections on unascertainedcauses of death indicate that some of these might be SADSif better clinicopathological information had been forth-coming. Further, in Chapter 9, the cases described as beingthe result of 'other causes, hypertrophy and brosis' areprobably SADS cases, of which there are up to six. In these cases, the autopsy was not comprehensive enough to enable the assessors to allocate the case to a particular cardiac cat-egory. Four of the women had a BMI 30. Here we group together the women who died of sudden unexpected cardiac death who were not hypertensive duringpregnancy (or who were well treated) and did not have oneof the 'explained' cardiac pathologies. It includes those whowere obese and those with otherwise unexplained left ven- tricular hypertrophy. The reason for this grouping is to high- light: the likelihood that pregnancy presents this scenario more frequently than is seen in the general population due tothe physiological stresses of pregnancy and delivery bring-ing out an underlying potential cardiac arrhythmia the crucial need for more comprehensive data collection and better categorisation to improve knowledge of the epidemiology of SADS. It is established that obesity and cardiac hypertrophy are associated in the absence of concurrent hypertension, andthat obesity and cardiac hypertrophy are both risk factorsfor arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Recently, thenotion of 'obesity cardiomyopathy' is gaining ground, 2and it applies particularly to those with a central versus aperipheral pattern of obesity. Such women have largehearts, and in the ten women with SADS, the median heartweight was 390 g (range 270-585 g). Of the heart to body weight ratios, seven of the ten were >0.42% of body weight, compared with the normal mean of 0.40% (range0.38-0.42). 3 In future, pathologists reviewing such cases must docu- ment optimally the morphology of the body (height,weight, BMI, pattern of obesity) as well as that of the heartso that closer analysis can be undertaken. The heart mor-phology required is listed in Best Practice points (above). The published European guidelines on examination of the heart provide the necessary information. 4 The fact that pregnancy makes the obesity-heart issue complicated, because of the greatly altered vascular physiol-ogy and the introduction of novel pathologies such as pre-eclampsia, is shown by the following case study. An obese woman, previously normotensive, was admitted during her third trimester with a blood pressure of 170/108 mmHg and proteinuria. Despite antihypertensive treat-ment, her blood pressure rose further, and she developedflash pulmonary oedema with breathlessness, followed bycardiac arrest. A peri-mortem caesarean section resulted in a live birth. At autopsy, her heart weighed 585 g, with left ventricular hypertrophy of 2.5 cm lateral wall thickness.Histopathology of pre-eclampsia. The conclusion on causa-tion was a combination of obesity-related heart hypertrophyplus pre-eclampsia. Ultimately, these deaths are individually unpredictable, and obesity needs to be addressed as a public health issueif the fatalities are not to rise further in the next report. j References 1Silwa K, Fett J, Elkayam U.

Other Indirect deaths: specic recommendations All women who are planning pregnancies that are likely to be complicated by potentially serious medical conditions should have pre-pregnancy counselling. Women whose pregnancies are complicated by potentially serious medical conditions should be referred to appropri-ate specialist centres of expertise where both care for their medical condition and their obstetric care can be opti-mised. Lack of consultant involvement remains a problem in the care of women with serious medical problems. Maternityunits should consider developing protocols to specify which medical conditions mandate consultant review. Health workers who are caring for women in pregnancy with conditions with which they are unfamiliar should con-sult experts. If necessary this consultation can be by telephone and most experts are only too pleased to help. Medical conditions that may be the cause of symptoms that are more commonly seen by obstetricians should not beignored, e.g. seizures can be caused by epilepsy as well as eclampsia. Multiple admissions or attendances for emergency care demand further investigation and are often an indication forreferral to specialists in other disciplines. Undiagnosed pain requiring opiates demands immediate consultant involvement and investigation. The need remains for physicians who do not work directly with pregnant women to know more about the interaction between the conditions that they are treating and pregnancy. Appropriate and professional interpretation services must be made available to women who do not speak English. Other Indirect deaths: learning points Most women with epilepsy require an increased lamotri- gine dose in pregnancy to maintain good seizure con- trol. Clinicians should adjust their management protocols accordingly.Women with epilepsy or undiagnosed syncope are stillunaware of the very rare but real risk of drowning whilebathing unattended. A shower is preferable and thebathroom door should remain unlocked.There should be no hesitation in arranging a chest X-ray for women with signicant chest symptoms. Simi- larly, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography of the brain can be used to exclude cerebralpathology.Clinicians should be aware that haemoglobin SC disease can cause sickle cell crisis and is as dangerous as haemo-globin SS disease.Women should be given advice about sexual intercourse in the postnatal period as fatal air embolism has been reported as a result of this. The medical assessors to thisEnquiry recommend abstinence for 6 weeks, or gentleintercourse and avoidance of positions where excess aircould be forced into the vagina. Introduction Indirect maternal deaths are dened as deaths resulting from previously existing disease or diseases that developduring pregnancy and which do not have direct obstetricChapter 10: Other Indirect deaths \u00aa2011 Centre for Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 119causes but are aggravated by the physiological effects of pregnancy.1 Examples of Indirect deaths include deaths from neuro- logical conditions, diabetes and HIV infection. Cardiaccauses of death are also classied as Indirect but, such is their prevalence, they are given their own chapter in this Report; Chapter 9. The international denition of maternaldeaths excludes deaths from suicide linked to perinatalmental illness and those from hormone-dependent malig-nancies, both of which the UK Assessors consider to belinked to the woman's pregnancy. Indirect malignancies are therefore counted and discussed in this chapter and psychi-atric deaths are counted in Chapter 11. The remaining deaths due to Indirect causes are counted and discussed in this chapter and are classied as Other Indirect . However, all these causes of death also contribute to the overall Indi- rect mortality rate calculated for this Report. Summary of key ndings for 2006-08 Table 10.1 shows that in 2006-08, the deaths of 88 women who died from Other Indirect maternal causes were reported to this Enquiry, including three Indirect malignan- cies, similar to the numbers for the previous two triennia.However, because of a rising number of births the actualrate is a little lower, as shown in Figure 10.1. All Indirect deaths still account for the majority (59%) of all maternalmortalities. Many of the Other Indirect deaths relate to the manage- ment and relevance in pregnancy of common symptoms such as breathlessness and headache. These topics are dis-cussed in the new section Back to basics . Substandard care Eleven of the 36 women who died from neurological condi- tions were deemed to have had major substandard care inthat different treatment might have altered the outcomeand from another 12 women lessons could be learnt although the outcome would not have altered. For the other 52 deaths from other Indirect causes, 17 women had major substandard care and 11 had minor substandard care. Thisgives an overall percentage of 58% cases with substandardcare (32% major and 26% minor as dened in Chapter 1). Specic causes of Indirect deaths Diseases of the central nervous system In this triennium 36 women died from diseases of the cen- tral nervous system. The overall number of deaths is simi-lar to previous years, and the proportion with epilepsy hasnot changed. However, there is a trend to slightly fewerwomen dying from subarachnoid haemorrhage than in pre-vious years.Epilepsy Fourteen women died of epilepsy, a rate of 0.61 per100 000 maternities. In the majority of cases the motherwas not referred for review by a neurologist despite aknown history of epilepsy. Only six women were referredfor neurology review, and in one woman, the neurologist'sadvice was not followed. It is likely that this resulted infailure to consider adjusting the anticonvulsant dose orchecking drug levels if necessary. This failure to refer to a specialist with experience of managing epilepsy represents substandard care. One additional woman with epilepsy isTable 10.1.

Nine women with epilepsy were treated with lamotrigine. Seven were treated with lamotrigine alone and two womenreceived polytherapy. One woman took lamotrigine andlevetiracetam and another took drug in combinationwith carbamazepine, antipsychotic and antidepressant med- ication. One woman stopped taking lamotrigine before conception. The other anticonvulsants used were carbamaz-epine in two women and phenytoin and sodium valproateas monotherapy each in one woman. Lamotrigine use in pregnancy There are specic considerations relating to lamotriginetreatment in pregnant women. It is clearly established that blood levels of the drug fall in all three trimesters of preg- nancy and that an increase in lamotrigine dose is required inthe majority of women. 2-5Blood levels were not checked during pregnancy for any of the nine women being treatedwith lamotrigine in this Report, although the lamotriginedose was increased in three women. Five women had druglevels checked at autopsy and of these, three were subthera-peutic and the other two were at the low end of the normal range. In two women, death occurred in the rst trimester, indicating that women with known epilepsy should haveearly review to ensure their lamotrigine dose and/or druglevels are reviewed. The National Institute for Health andClinical Excellence recommendations regarding the treat-ment of epilepsy 6advise that routine monitoring of anticon- vulsant levels is not recommended in pregnancy, but withthe important caveat that monitoring of anticonvulsant drug levels may be useful for dose adjustment if seizures increase or are likely to increase. The assessors consider that all thosecaring for women with epilepsy in pregnancy should be aware of the likely fall in lamotrigine levels in pregnancy and that they should take account of this in their managementplans. A management strategy that aims to reduce the doseof anticonvulsant in pregnancy to reduce effects on the fetusshould be tempered by the knowledge that a pregnancy-induced reduction in blood levels of some anticonvulsantdrugs will increase the risk of seizure. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy The actual cause of death in 11 of the 14 women with epi-lepsy was categorised as sudden unexpected death in and nondrowningdeath in a patient with epilepsy, with or without evidencefor a seizure, and excluding documented status epilepticus,where the autopsy examination does not reveal a toxicolog- ical or anatomical cause of death'. This is the commonest cause of death in epileptics and epidemiological studiesshow that it occurs most commonly in chronic epilepticswith poorly controlled seizures. The women that were notdiagnosed as dying of SUDEP had seizure-related deaths.One had hypoxic brain damage following a prolonged sei-zure, one sustained chest trauma following a seizure andthis resulted in empyema with subsequent intracranial abscess, endocarditis and multi-organ failure. The third woman died while bathing, which emphasises the impor-tance of women with epilepsy receiving advice about therisks of bathing themselves and their babies while unat-tended. This woman had received pre-pregnancy counsel-ling from a neurologist, but there is no documentation toindicate that this specic risk was mentioned. Nine of the 14 women with epilepsy died while pregnant. One died approximately 4 weeks after a miscarriage and four women died in the postpartum period. maternities Figure 10.1. Total Indirect maternal mortality rates for all causes of Indirect deaths combined; cardiac, psychiatric and Other Indirect ; UK: 1985-2008.Chapter 10: Other Indirect deaths \u00aa2011 Centre (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 121died of was aware that she was preg- nant. Of the 11 women who had sought antenatal care,only six were referred to a healthcare provider with aninterest in epilepsy. It is of paramount importance thatwomen with epilepsy are seen by healthcare providers with expertise in the management of the condition. The reasons for not referring varied. In some cases the obstetric andmidwifery team do not appear to have perceived maternalepilepsy as a high-risk condition. This attitude is inappro-priate given the large number of deaths from epilepsy inpregnancy. For example: One woman with a known history of epilepsy was taking lamotrigine and had a seizure a few days after delivery. Shewas treated as having eclampsia despite having no hyper-tension, nor proteinuria, and the only biochemical abnor-mality was raised serum urate. She was not referred to aneurologist at any stage during pregnancy or the postnatal period and lamotrigine levels were never checked. Even at the incident review after her death there was no mention ofthe need for referral to a neurologist or physician with expe-rience in managing epilepsy. In another case the neurology service did not make an appointment until nearly 5 months after receiving an initialreferral. Failure of the neurology service to review thiswoman despite an urgent referral represents substandardcare. Only six of the 14 women with epilepsy had received pre-pregnancy counselling. Several women might not have died if they had been advised about the maternal risks in pregnancies complicated by epilepsy, hence the key recom-mendation at the beginning of this chapter. One-third of the epileptic women who died in this report had difcult social circumstances that were likely tocause them to be excluded from mainstream healthcareprovision. Two had a history of domestic abuse necessitat-ing involvement of the police or social services, another had suffered physical abuse from her stepmother before marriage at an early age and there was subsequent evidenceof bullying from her mother-in-law. Another woman hadparanoid schizophrenia. Healthcare providers should beaware that women with epilepsy who also live in difcultsocial circumstances are at particular risk of poor seizurecontrol and require additional effort to ensure their diseaseis well controlled. Cerebral artery thrombosis Four women died of cerebral thrombosis, a rate of 0.17 per100 000 maternities. Two deaths occurred in the rst tri-mester. In the rst, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) wasinappropriately withheld because of unwarranted fearsabout its use during pregnancy and in the other womanectopic pregnancy was not considered:An older woman with learning difculties who had a his- tory of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) was admitted withnew symptoms of hemiparesis on the opposite side. Shedeveloped right iliac fossa tenderness as an inpatient andwas subsequently found to have a ruptured ectopic preg- nancy. There was a delay in gynaecological assessment and it is likely that the resultant blood loss and cerebral hypop-erfusion exacerbated her CVA. There are also two women with likely cerebral vein throm- bosis in this Report, counted in Chapter 2, but the diagno- sis was not straightforward in either of them. Bothpresented with headache and neurological symptoms afterdelivery at term. They also both had previous medical com-plications that could have caused dehydration. In additionthey were obese, which has become recognised as a for 000 maternities. Six had subarachnoid haemorrhageand ve had intracerebral bleeds. None of the bleeds wereassociated with labour and only two women died undeliv-ered. Six of the women presented with sudden collapse or severe headache with rapid deterioration and subsequent death. Four women had no previous symptoms to alert thehealthcare providers that they were at risk of an intracra-nial bleed. Of those that presented with symptoms, one woman complained of headache several times while pregnant andanother had eye pain with blurred vision. The two womenwho did not present with rapid deterioration of their men- tal state both complained of headache at the time of pre- sentation. Two women had antenatal hypertension and inone woman this was not adequately monitored. Fivewomen had substandard care. The reasons ranged fromobstruction to obtaining MRI scans and failure of the clini-cal team to think of the diagnosis, to inappropriate contin-uation of medication that would exacerbate pre-existinghypertension. The case described below illustrates the importance of referral to senior clinicians with experience in managing neurological disease in pregnancy. If thiswoman had been investigated thoroughly the diagnosismight have been made at a time when intervention waspossible: An asylum seeker was treated with labetalol for hyperten- sion at booking which subsequently settled and treatmentwas stopped. She complained of episodic headache through-out pregnancy and presented at term with frontal headacheand hypertension but no investigations were performed andshe was discharged home after delivery. A few days laterde Swiet et al. 122 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203she complained of severe headaches, pain and visual distur- bance and altered facial sensation and although she wasreviewed by junior medical, neurological and obstetric staff,there is no evidence of senior review. An MRI was per-formed to exclude cerebral vein thrombosis and arterial dis- section; however, the possibility of cerebral haemorrhage is not mentioned in the notes and computed tomography (CT;the imaging modality most likely to demonstrate an acutecerebral bleed) was not requested at this time. She was dis-charged and re-admitted 2 weeks after delivery having col-lapsed at home. A CT scan showed subarachnoidhaemorrhage. Four of the women who died from subarachnoid haemor- rhage had difcult social circumstances. One was an asy-lum seeker and another was a refugee. Two were known tosocial services through drug use, violence or both.Although this is unlikely to have been a cause of the sub- arachnoid haemorrhages, it is possible that these women had more barriers to obtaining rapid antenatal/medicalassessment than women who do not have adverse socialcircumstances. This in turn may have led to delayed diag-nosis and therefore to worse clinical outcomes. Smoking isa recognised risk factor for aneurysmal subarachnoidhaemorrhage and two of the women in this group weresmokers. There were ve women with intracerebral haemorrhage. In one woman the symptoms occurred almost immediatelyafter delivery and another two presented several days post-natally. For example: A woman saw her GP in early pregnancy complaining of several episodes of numbness, tingling and inability to lifther arm over the past year or so. She was referred to a neu-rologist and she received an appointment for 3 monthslater. She then mentioned these episodes in the antenatalclinic and was also referred for a neurology opinion. Theneurologist associate specialist who saw her shortly after- wards recommended an MRI after delivery. She was admit- ted near term with slurred speech, headache, visualsymptoms and numbness on one side and referred to themedical team. The medical specialist registrar did not feelthat the woman needed an urgent review and suggested aneurology review the following week but the obstetric teamre-requested a review to exclude remediable neurologicaldisease, clearly stating that they were happy for her to have an MRI in pregnancy and recommended expediting the scan but this was not performed. A few days after anuneventful delivery she was found dead at home and anautopsy revealed a large intracerebral haemorrhage. In another case, a woman had a rare hereditary condition that predisposed to intracranial haemorrhage. Neither herGP nor her obstetric team appeared to realise that thiswoman was at high-risk, further underlining the impor- tance of communication and the need to refer to specialistsif the healthcare providers are not experienced at managingcomplex medical disorders. Other lessons to be learnt from these cases are that women with new and potentially serious neurological symptoms in pregnancy must be seen promptly by a spe-cialist who also understands that all imaging modalities canbe used in pregnancy if necessary, and the implications ofheadache and unilateral weakness or numbness. Further-more, neurological symptoms late in pregnancy mandatean urgent review and cerebral imaging if indicated. Meningitis/infection Three women died of central nervous system infection ofwhom two had pneumococcal meningitis. Both of thesewomen had complained of headache the day before death,but there were no specic clinical features to suggest men-ingitis or sepsis. Both women deteriorated rapidly and diedthe next day. In the third woman meningitis was part ofthe differential diagnosis but no senior staff were involved in her care and no antibiotics were given. She had a respi- ratory arrest while being investigated and died soon after. Other neurological deaths Other women died from a spectrum of rare or difcult toexplain neurological diseases. For example, one had arecurrent carotid artery dissection despite excellent man-agement by a multidisciplinary team that included neurolo- gists, obstetricians and neurosurgeons. Another pregnant mother, who had an unremarkable medical history and aprevious uncomplicated pregnancy, collapsed and died athome after a 2-week history of nausea and vomiting. Herautopsy showed a colloid cyst adjacent to the foramen ofMonro and other features consistent with raised intracra-nial pressure that was thought to be the cause of death. Afurther woman was found dead in the bath close to the time of delivery. She had a history of undiagnosed absence seizures and had been given an opiate for pain relief inlabour. Women with seizures should not bathe unsuper-vised. Showering is preferable. While the opiate treatmentis unlikely to have caused her death alone, it would haveincreased her risk of death should she have had a seizureor syncopal attack. Infectious diseases The deaths of seven women are discussed here. Bacterial infection There has been concern about the increasing number ofdeaths from acute streptococcal infections, which has alsobeen raised in Chapter 7. For this report the majority ofthe streptococcal infections presenting in pregnancy andChapter 10: Other Indirect deaths \u00aa2011 Centre for Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 123for 6 weeks after delivery continue to be counted as Direct deaths even if there was no evidence of genital tract infec-tion. In future, these deaths may be classied differentlyand considered elsewhere as discussed in the Annex toChapter 7. However, one woman who died from strepto- coccal disease also had HIV infection and is counted here. In another case: A pregnant woman died from staphylococcal pneumonia and septicaemia in association with Influenza group B. She also had mild bronchial asthma for which she had attended the Emergency Department a few days previously. Her carein the Emergency Department was good. Her asthma wasnot severe at the time and the advice to increase her salbu-tamol inhalation and take a short course of oral steroidswas appropriate. Data from previous pandemics suggestthat women are more likely to die from influenza whenpregnant. A further woman died in the puerperium from a Gram- negative infection and liver abscesses having been admit-tedin extremis with an acute abdomen. She had attended her GP with back pain several times after delivery and was reassured each time without investigation. Althoughbackache is common in the puerperium, multiple atten-dances must be taken seriously and demand further inves-tigation. Viral infection: human immunodeciency virus One woman with known HIV infection was not responding to treatment, perhaps because of failures of compliance. She was admitted with overwhelming streptococcal pneu-monia, had an inevitable miscarriage and died a few hourslater. In another case: A woman with a complex social history refused admission for a chest infection in pregnancy because she was con-cerned her children would be taken into care and she onlysaw a midwife a few weeks later. She was not fully bookedfor several more weeks because she missed a scan appoint-ment which was not followed up. She was eventually admit-ted with pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii and adiagnosis of HIV infection was made. She was discharged home and her midwives were not informed. Her HIV ther- apy was delayed for several more weeks and none was givenwhen she went into preterm labour because there was noHIV protocol on the delivery suite and no advice could beobtained after hours. She was delivered by caesarean sectionfor fetal distress and died later from overwhelming sepsisand colitis. There is no evidence that the HIV team was involved in her care. In newly diagnosed cases of HIV infection a con-sultant obstetrician should be involved as soon as the diag-nosis is made. HIV/AIDS is now a treatable disease.Tuberculosis Two women from the Indian subcontinent died of tuber-culosis (TB) but were diagnosed late. In one this wasbecause her chest symptoms were rst ascribed to pulmo-nary embolus. The other woman was initially thought to be suffering from anorexia nervosa, an erroneous diagno- sis conrmed by a consultant psychiatrist because ofweight loss in the rst half of pregnancy. When TB wassuspected it was impossible to perform an immunologicalTB skin test because the test was only available on certaindays of the week. She died shortly afterwards and herautopsy showed miliary TB with nodules over lungs andperitoneum. Anorexia is exceedingly uncommon in preg- nancy, if only because such women do not ovulate, and all underlying causes for weight loss should be excludedbefore considering a psychiatric referral. Immunologicaltests for TB should be readily available for high-riskwomen, especially as TB is becoming more prevalent. A UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) prospective, national study of TB in pregnancy between August 2005 andAugust 2006 reported an estimated annual incidence of 42 cases per million maternities (95% condence interval 29-59 per million maternities 7). The disease was limited to women from ethnic minorities as in the two women described here.Extrapulmonary disease was as common as pulmonary inthe UKOSS study but only women with pulmonary diseasedied. From these gures the estimated total number of casesof TB in the triennium was 266 (95% CI 184-374). As twopregnant women died from TB in this triennium, the esti- mated case fatality rate of TB in pregnancy in 2006-08 is 1:133 known cases (95% CI 1:92 to 1:187). Respiratory diseases Bronchial asthma Five women died from asthma this triennium, 0.22 per100 000 maternities, a similar number to those in the two previous Reports. None had specialist care in pregnancy even though three had had many hospital admissions orhad brittle asthma that was particularly difcult to treat.For example: A woman who had asthma since childhood had at least 20 referrals for hospital care within the previous few years,including some episodes where she had a cardiac arrest.During her pregnancy she was cared for entirely within thecommunity and had no specialist referral. Asthma was notmentioned in her GP's referral letter. Although asthma does not of itself deteriorate in preg- nancy, women often withhold or decrease asthma medica-tion because of the unfounded fear that it will harm thefetus. They need specialist care in pregnancy if only to reas-de Swiet et al. 124 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203sure them that this is not so. Fears that medication for women with asthma will harm the fetus extends to theirmedical attendants, as in the case of another young womanwith brittle asthma who was incorrectly told by her GP tostop prednisolone in early pregnancy. In the case of a woman who died from acute severe asthma after a medical termination of pregnancy: A woman was known to be atopic and to suffer from asthma. The nature of the drugs used for the termination was not available to the assessors but they are likely to have been Mifepristone, a progesterone and glucocorticoid antag-onist, followed by misoprostol a prostaglandin of the E ser-ies. The procedure took 2 days, as usual, but on dischargeshe became breathless and she was reluctant to use herasthma medications because she thought they might interactwith the drugs given for her termination. She died a fewhours after discharge. There has been concern about the use of Mifepristone in women with asthma because progesterone is a bronchodila-tor and a progesterone antagonist might cause bronchocon- striction. Also glucocorticoid antagonist has the potential to antagonise endogenous cortisol and steroids used for thetreatment of asthma. But the British National Formulary(BNF) advises against the use of Mifepristone only insevere and uncontrolled asthma, which this woman did nothave. With regard to misoprostol there has also been con-cern about the use of prostaglandins in women withasthma and the BNF also has a specic warning about this. However, the evidence for prostaglandin-induced broncho- constriction is only clear for prostaglandins of the F2 aser- ies such as Carboprost, not those of the E series such asMisoprostol. Many women with known asthma have beengive prostaglandin E for induction of labour withoutadverse outcome. It seems unlikely that this was a case ofMifepristone-induced or misoprostol-induced bronchocon-striction. However, this incident should be noted in case of further occurrences. Bronchial asthma is not a contraindi- cation to medical termination of pregnancy. Respiratory infectious disease Four women died of pneumonia this triennium, most ofwhom had underlying social factors such as severe depriva-tion. For example: A pregnant woman who spoke no English died after admis- sion from pneumonia without any causative organism beingfound. According to the relative who acted as her inter-preter, she had been breathless for a week but had notreported this because she thought it normal for pregnancy. Her condition deteriorated and she required ventilation on the Critical-Care Unit until she was delivered. She died afew days later.This woman's medical care was good once she was admit- ted. The problem was the delay. It will never be known ifher breathlessness was trivial; but maternity services mustmake efforts to make their services accessible to deprivedimmigrants who do not speak English. Endocrine, metabolic and immune diseases Endocrine Three women died from diabetes mellitus, 0.13 per 100 000maternities, all probably because of hypoglycaemia. In atypical example: A woman with known insulin-dependant diabetes went to see her GP very early in pregnancy but was asked to comeback some weeks later for booking bloods and to be referredto the antenatal clinic. A month later and a wasted 6 weeksafter she rst saw her GP, the booking bloods showed a high glycosylated haemoglobin indicating poor diabetic control. The booking midwife consulted the diabetic specialist nurseand arranged for her to be seen in the obstetrician's anddiabetologist's separate clinics. She saw a diabetic specialistnurse who planned 2-weekly review. The diabetic nursenoted several episodes of dangerously severe hypoglycaemia.She rst saw the consultant diabetologist a few months fol-lowing her rst visit to the GP and died of a hypoglycaemic attack soon after. All women with pre-existing diabetes should have pre-preg- nancy counselling and this woman's complicated diabetes should have been under consultant care whether she was pregnant or not. This woman should have been seen in acombined diabetic/obstetric clinic much earlier in preg-nancy, which could have been organised by telephoneimmediately after she saw her GP given the importance ofgood diabetic control in early pregnancy. Her own obstetriccentre itself was too small for a combined diabetic/obstetricclinic and there was a lack of communication between the 'diabetic centre' and the obstetric-midwifery team; the woman was not advised to take her hand-held notes to thediabetic centre. Her partner did not seem to have beeninstructed on how to give glucagon. This was a case of hypoglycaemic death in a woman trying desperately to control diabetes in early pregnancy, asoccurred in the other two deaths from diabetes. This is aproblem noted in previous Reports. A ne balance has to be drawn between correctly encouraging women to optimise their diabetic control and frightening them so much thatthey risk serious and sometimes fatal problems from hypo-glycaemia. In addition, as noted in the Key recommenda-tions, women whose pregnancies are complicated bypotentially serious medical conditions should be referred toappropriate specialist centres of expertise where both care fortheir medical condition and their obstetric care can be opti-Chapter 10: Other Indirect deaths \u00aa2011 Centre for (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 125mised. The obstetric centre where this woman was managed was too small to have a proper combined diabetic andobstetric clinic. She should have been referred elsewhere. Immunological disorders Four women, 0.17 per 100 000 maternities, died eitherfrom systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or from othercauses where lupus was a factor. Another case associatedwith SLE is counted in the Haematology section becausethrombotic thrombocytopoenic purpura was her primarycause of death. For some of these women there were,again, failures of communication. For example one recentimmigrant spoke little English and her relative, who tried to translate, spoke even less. No history was recorded by the GP at booking in early pregnancy and no examinationwas performed. Three months later she complained ofmultiple joint pains and soon after she was admitted des-perately ill with polyarthralgia due to SLE. She was trans-ferred to a tertiary centre but died 3 weeks later of multi-organ failure. The need for interpreters in the communityis still not being met. Under these circumstances, consid- eration should be given to referral to hospital where inter- preters are usually more easily available, if only for asingle consultation.In another case, also discussed in Chapter 11: A woman was incorrectly told to stop hydroxychloroquine when she became pregnant and when the equally impor-tant problem of positive extractable nuclear antigens(ENA) antibodies, which may cause congenital heartblock, was ignored. She was admitted several times inpregnancy feeling unwell and was eventually seen by theliaison psychiatrist. She became very disorientated afterdelivery when she was found to have lupus nephritis. She died soon after delivery from multiple organ failure. The need remains for physicians who do not work directly with pregnant women to know more about the interaction between the conditions that they are treating and preg- nancy. One further woman died from anaphylaxis following intravenous Augmentin given for pyrexia in labour. Shehad been asked about drug allergy in pregnancy and beforethe Augmentin was given. There was no substandard care.Women still die from anaphylaxis. Metabolic disease Failure of communication and unavailability of hospitalnotes were the principal reasons why a woman died with, arare inborn error of metabolism, which predisposes to hyp-oglycaemia and lactic acidosis. She attended a physician in an obstetric clinic where her previous pregnancy had been managed successfully. Shetoo spoke little English. Her hospital notes were unavail- able and there was no booking letter but fortunately thephysician remembered her. She complained of nausea andvomiting but was reluctant to be admitted. The physicianadvised on outpatient treatment and told the woman how she/he could be contacted. Her vomiting got much worse and she was admitted to a gynaecology ward via theEmergency Department. Her notes still could not befound. The physician was not called despite a requestfrom her relatives who said that she had hypoglycaemiaand needed a central line. There were difculties obtain-ing intravenous access. She was eventually found to begrossly acidotic and was admitted to the intensive-care unit where she died some weeks later from septicaemia and multi-organ failure. The failures were that the junior staff did not listen to the woman or her relatives and that her notes should also have been available. Another woman died from an extremely rare autosomal recessive condition associated with other physical problemsleading to mild or fatal disease. Her consultant obstetricianappears to have made no attempt to read or consult aboutthis condition, which has never been described in preg-nancy before. Health workers who are caring for women inpregnancy with conditions that they are not familiar with should take the trouble to consult experts, if only by tele- phone. Diseases of the gastrointestinal tract There were nine deaths from disease of the gastrointestinaltract, of which two were from complications of duodenalulcers. In both women, the diagnosis was made too late.One woman was admitted on several occasions in late pregnancy with increasingly severe epigastric pain eventu- ally requiring opiates. She delivered and went home withno clinical observations recorded. She was readmitted a fewdays later with a fatal haematemesis. Another womandeveloped abdominal pain in mid-pregnancy which wasthought to be the result of her intercurrent pre-eclampsia.After delivery the pain worsened with a tense abdomen andguarding. After more than 24 hours she eventually saw a consultant obstetrician and she died in surgery from a per- forated duodenal ulcer. In both of these women the clini-cians did not think beyond the possibility of pregnancy-related complications soon enough. Consultants wereinvolved too late in the second woman, where steroidsgiven for fetal lung maturation may also have contributedto the perforation. Several women died from complications of cirrhosis or liver disease and one from hyperlipidaemia. In these and several other women the responsible cliniciansseemed to be unaware of the high-risk nature of thede Swiet et al. 126 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203women's pregnancies. They were managed at different hospitals for their medical conditions and there was alack of communication between services. They wereoften treated inappropriately by junior staff. Womenwith rare conditions and high-risk pregnancies such as these need pre-pregnancy counselling and then to be managed jointly at tertiary centres by the relevant spe-cialist and obstetric services. They are likely to requirean anaesthetic assessment before delivery and any opera-tive interventions must be undertaken by fully trainedconsultants. There were no deaths this triennium from Ogilvie syn- drome. There was, however, one death from pseudomem- branous colitis and two from Crohn's disease. One of these two women was admitted many times in preg- nancy before she was found to be obstructed. She was dis-charged severely anaemic following surgery and readmitted moribund 3 weeks later. She could not be resuscitated and died from complications of the original surgery. There hadbeen no communication between the surgeons and theobstetric team. She had never been seen by a gastroenterolo-gist despite her multiple admissions. As indicated in the Key recommendations above: multiple admissions or attendances for emergency care demand fur-ther investigation and are often a reason for referral to spe-cialists in other disciplines. Diseases of the blood Two women died from thrombotic thrombocytopoenicpurpura (TTP) (one per million maternities), a rare hae-mangiopathic haemolytic anaemia which is relatively morecommon in pregnancy. One of these women died from amyocardial infarct. Infarction is common in TTP becauseof small-vessel coronary thrombosis. One woman withknown connective tissue disease went to an EmergencyDepartment with chest pain and was triaged by nursing staff to the Obstetric Day Unit where she only ever saw a junior doctor. Although her blood tests showed florid redcell fragmentation, a main diagnostic feature of TTP, thiswas not reported or transmitted to the specialist unit towhich she was referred the next day. She died with multiplethrombi in the heart. Here again there was lack of referralin early pregnancy to a specialist unit of a highly complexcase at very high risk. A woman with haemoglobin SC disease developed a urinary tract infection that was ignored and led to Strep- tococcus pneumoniae sepsis and death from septicaemia. She had been labelled as having sickle cell trait despitehaving had previous sickle cell crisis and documentedhaemoglobin SC disease on the hospital computer. Shehad no pre-pregnancy counselling and no referral to aspecialist haematologist until the day that she died. Previ-ous reports have emphasised the risk of haemoglobin SC disease. Clinicians are unaware that it is a sickling condi-tion and are misled by the relatively high haemoglobinconcentration. Circulatory conditions One woman died of a spontaneous ruptured splenic artery.Splenic artery rupture is relatively more common in preg-nancy, whether an aneurysm is present or not. Anotherwoman died of a ruptured spleen, which is very uncom-mon in pregnancy. In a further case of ruptured spleen itis possible that this woman's spleen ruptured during theparamedics' attempts at resuscitation, particularly as she was morbidly obese. Air embolus One or two deaths from air embolus usually occur in each triennium. In this case: A woman who died from air embolus collapsed with breathlessness during sexual intercourse about 2 weeks aftervaginal delivery. At autopsy there was frothy blood in thepulmonary trunk and exuding from the myometrium andthere were gaping vessels in the uterus. In this form of air embolus, air is forced from the vagina into the uterus and enters the venous circulation throughthe vessels of the raw vascular bed. The resultant froth inthe right ventricle effectively causes a cardiac arrest becauseof lack of cardiac output. This is a recognised but rare cause of maternal death. Couples are advised to preferably abstain from sexual intercourse for 6 weeks postnatally orhave only gentle intercourse and to avoid positions/prac-tices where excessive air could be forced into the vagina. Rare conditions A previously t woman had a cyanotic attack in the night.She was dead by the time she arrived in hospital. At autopsy the larynx and epiglottis were oedematous. Because of high immunoglobulin E tryptase levels and followingdiscussion with a clinical immunologist the cause of deathwas given as idiopathic angio-oedema. One woman died from benign leiomyoma- tosis and another from congenital muscular dystrophy ofunknown type and severe kyphoscoliosis. They are bothcounted in the other respiratory conditions section of respiratory disease. Both had been advised against preg- nancy but they elected to continue, despite medical advice.Women with very serious medical complications, particu-larly respiratory and cardiac, may die in pregnancy evenwith the very good care that these women received. Oncefully informed of the situation, if they choose to continuewith pregnancy they should be allowed to do so withdignity.Chapter 10: Other Indirect deaths \u00aa2011 Centre for Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 127Cancer Pregnancy does not alter the incidence or prognosis of most malignancies compared with similar cancers diag-nosed at the same stage in nonpregnant women. Pregnancymay, however, accelerate the growth of some cancers, par- ticularly those which are hormone-dependent such as can- cers of the breast and reproductive tract, or those whichoccur in the blood, brain or skin. Choriocarcinoma, ofwhich there were two reported cases this triennium, is theonly malignancy directly linked to pregnancy. Deaths from cancer and other tumours have had a chapter to themselves in the last two Reports. As fewerCoincidental deaths were reviewed this triennium, and also because the general lessons do not change very much, the lessons from these women have been included in thischapter for this Report. Earlier Reports contain muchmore detail on cancer in pregnancy and are still relevanttoday. The Enquiry assessors considered the deaths of 14 women who died of cancer during 2006-08, the details ofwhich are shown in Table 10.2. The deaths of two women who died from choriocarcinoma were classied as Direct orLate Direct and three related to hormone-dependent tumours were classied as Indirect. The case of a woman who died from an infection related to cancer of the cervixis not counted here but is counted and discussed inChapter 7. The deaths of three women with longstand-ing breast cancer before pregnancy were assessed to beCoincidental. For the rst time in the continuing series of these Reports, the majority of the women reported to theEnquiry who died from cancer received a good, if notexcellent, standard of care. There was ample evidence ofjoint care plans being developed with oncologists, paedia- tricians, anaesthetists and others and those who cared forthem gave sensitive statements to the Enquiry. From thecases assessed for this triennium, in only two could it besaid that the diagnosis was delayed, but in one by only a few days. In the other case however: A very young girl with a complex social history was unwell for a year or so with vomiting and severe loss of weight.Her symptoms were ascribed to an eating disorder although she did not seem to have been referred for psychiatric care. Early in her illness she attended the local EmergencyDepartment with a history of vomiting, abdominal painand irregular periods and a positive pregnancy test wasoverlooked and not followed up. During the succeedingmonths, she repeatedly returned to the Emergency Depart-ment with similar symptoms but no pregnancy test was per-formed, perhaps because of her age. Her symptoms were either ascribed to an eating disorder or gastritis. Nearly a year after her positive pregnancy test she was admitted anddied of a cerebrovascular accident because of disseminatedchoriocarcinoma. The care this girl received was substandard in many ways. First, she was not told of her positive pregnancy test andit was not followed up. This was particularly importantbecause she was a very young and vulnerable girl whowould have needed intense support during her pregnancyin any event. The pregnancy test was never repeateddespite numerous attendances with similar symptoms, which were always ascribed to an 'eating disorder' although this diagnosis was never recorded in her GP'snotes nor had she received a psychiatric assessment.Numerous opportunities were missed to investigate hersymptoms further although she did have an extremely rarecondition. Pathological commentary These Other Indirect deaths were very heterogeneous. Not all had autopsies and where the quality of the autopsyreport was deemed substandard there were the usual issuesof not taking enough or any samples for histopathologyand not thinking through the diagnostic possibilities inher-ent in the death. As the Royal College of Pathologistsguidelines emphasise, consultation with relevant clinicianscan be invaluable in complex cases, and these autopsy reports contain little or no evidence of such deliberations taking place. 8 Neurology Epilepsy Of the 14 women with epilepsy, all had autopsies, and thestandard overall was good, in that they addressed the criti-Table 10.2.

Thebasic mechanism of SUDEP is thought to be an arrhythmiaoccurring during an epileptic seizure, stopping the heart beat. Cerebral thrombosis Autopsies were performed in the minority of women with ischaemic stroke because imaging pre-mortem usuallyidenties the pathology. Thrombophilia was a factoralready known in one woman. The pathologist cannotidentify an inherited thrombophilic state post-mortem because functional blood clotting tests cannot be performed on autopsy blood. Genetic studies of DNA forknown prothrombotic conditions have not been validatedon autopsy material. Not all of the cases of stroke were aetiologically resolved. In one woman, who died of a thrombotic stroke in thepuerperium and did not have an autopsy, the diagnosiscould have been arterial occlusion, possibly from paradoxi- cal vein thrombosis, or tuberculous meningitis. Obviously, knowingwhich was the case, would have informed clinical audit, aswell as categorising the case better as a Direct ,Indirect or Coincidental death. Cerebral haemorrhage Subarachnoid haemorrhage Of the six women who died with a subarachnoid haemor- rhage, only one had an autopsy. The others were diagnosedat CT scan and/or craniotomy, with the aneurysm identi-ed the subarachnoid and intracerebral haemor-rhage. With a condent clinical cause of death there wasno requirement for a medico-legal autopsy. The singleautopsy exemplies some of the problems in specifying thecause of death when women present as 'death in the com- munity': An obese woman collapsed in a car park toward the end of pregnancy and was dead on arrival at the EmergencyDepartment. Her booking blood pressure was 110/ 80 mmHg. The neuropathological autopsy found a ruptured berry aneurysm and subarachnoid haemorrhage; but theheart weighed 411 g, denitely enlarged with left ventricularhypertrophy. The kidney was not scrutinised for glomerularendotheliosis (the histological marker for pre-eclampsia), sothe questions regarding the underlying predisposition foraneurysm rupture remain open: was this essential hyperten-sion despite the booking blood pressure, acute pre-eclampsia with rise in blood pressure, obesity cardiomyopathy and coincidental ruptured aneurysm or idiopathic left ventricu-lar hypertrophy with ruptured aneurysm?Infection The women with apparently primary bacterial pneumoniaswere not well evaluated at autopsy apart from a womenwho died in her second trimester from staphylococcalpneumonia complicating type B influenza. For the other women, no attempt at lung microbiology was made, which is disappointing given the importance of the epide-miology of community-acquired pneumonia in this agegroup. In neither of the two HIV-positive women was acoronial autopsy necessary, but in one woman it was per-formed. However, the pathologist showed little insightinto the complex pathologies encountered in late-stageHIV disease, and the report would have helped neither the HIV doctors nor the obstetricians in their clinical audit. Diabetes All the women who died of diabetic hypoglycaemia hadautopsies, which were not all well done. In two of thethree women the characteristic red neurone change inthe brain was not documented histologically and nor were the glucose and insulin levels measured in blood and vitreous fluids. The associated dead-in-bed syndrome is worth mention- ing as a relatively new entity. The basic mechanism of SU-DEP is thought to be an arrhythmia occurring during anepileptic seizure, stopping the heart beat. Similarly withunexplained deaths in diabetes, the so-called diabetic'dead-in-bed syndrome'. This was documented twice in this triennium in women who had been insulin-dependent dia- betics for more than 10 years. For example: A woman with longstanding type 1 diabetes for many years and who had had many hypoglycaemic episodes, was found dead in bed in mid-pregnancy. The post-mortem biochemis-try for glucose and insulin was ambiguous, as is often thecase but the brain histopathology showed hypoglycaemic-type neuronal necrosis. The diabetologist consulted on thecase proposed the sudden nocturnal death in diabetes sce-nario, which comprises a diabetic autonomic a long QT interval\u2014leading to fatal hypoglycaemia causing death; hyp- oglycaemia is critically associated with cardiac electricalinstability. Liver disease Two women died as a result of bleeding from cirrhoticportal hypertension. The deaths of two other womenhighlight how complicated medicine can be, because whatactually happened was not nally resolved despite goodautopsies. In a woman who had liver abscesses and peri-tonitis, the route of infection was not ascertained, despiteChapter 10: Other Indirect deaths \u00aa2011 Centre Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 'negatives'. Pos- sibilities include the throat, though this should have beenclinically obvious from severe local pain, the vagina andthe faecal flora. In the second difcult case, with focalnodular hyperplasia of the liver and then fatal intra- abdominal bleeding, the combination of the laparotomy and autopsy ndings concluded that there was probablyspontaneous tearing of liver-spleen adhesions. Focal nodu-lar hyperplasia is to be associated with preg-nancy. Thrombotic thrombocytopoenic purpura TTP is rare, and in both women it was diagnosed or sug- gested before death. Rapid death, as in these women, results from cardiac thrombotic microangiopathy withischaemic cardiac failure. The laboratory data of low plate-lets with normal clotting factors is distinctive. The autopsyhistopathology is similarly characteristic, with thromboticmicroangiopathy in the renal glomeruli as well. One candistinguish the two aetiological patterns of thromboticmicroangiopathy with immunohistochemistry: in TTP, the thrombi are nearly pure platelets (stained well with anti- bodies to CD61), whereas in disseminated intravascularcoagulation, the thrombi contain more brin (demonstra-ble with anti-brin antibodies) than platelets. Sickle cell disease The pathology of the sickle cell deaths from sepsis is dis-cussed in Chapter 7. In another death from sickling, a woman with haemoglobin SS disease was being investigated for chest pain in hospital when she collapsed and died. Theautopsy reportedly showed 'myocardial ischaemia'. But cor-onary artery disease at this age is rare, venous thromboem-bolism is unlikely in haemoglobin SS disease, and the acutesickle chest syndrome is a more likely pathology. Sickleautopsies, like HIV and maternal autopsies, can be compli-cated, and need consideration and a full protocol procedure as described in the Royal College of Pathologists Autopsy Guidelines on Sickle cell disease, 2005. 10 Air embolism Here the autopsy is critical. Ideally, imaging with CT scanwill identify the gas in the heart before the body is opened,but routine CT scanning of cadavers has yet to become thenorm. In this woman, the heart was correctly opened under water in situ in the pericardium and gas bubbles burst from the right ventricle; there was also frothy blood in the myome-trium. It is important to note that the presence of gas bub-bles in the meningeal vessels, once thought to indicate airembolism, is an artefact that arises from the vacuum tempo-rarily created within the cranium when the skull bone isremoved. In all peripartum death autopsies, the heart should,as a matter of protocol, be opened under water.Unascertained causes of death There were six women for whom the cause of death wasuncertain, often because the autopsy was inadequate. Thesedeaths are distinguished from sudden adult death syn-drome (SADS), where an adequate autopsy has shown no other cause for death as discussed in Chapter 9. For one woman a phaeochromocytoma may have been the cause ofdeath. Another woman had been ill for some weeks beforedeath with breathlessness and vomiting. She clearly had amajor metabolic problem with grossly elevated blood ureaand serum creatinine and low serum sodium but no othercause of death could be identied at autopsy. A thirdwoman with type 2 diabetes taking insulin had a cardiac arrest. Her death was recorded as being the result of eclampsia although there was no evidence to support thisother than modest hypertension and a bitten tongue. Herautopsy was decient and lacking many details. This deathcould have been diabetes related; it could have been cardiacrelating to diabetes or hypertension; it could have been asudden adult cardiac death; but because of the other possi-bilities, it has been classied as unascertained rather than sudden adult death syndrome. Conclusion This triennium the assessors have been struck by the lack of referral of potentially high-risk women. The reasons forfailure to refer are likely to be multiple. However, medicalcare is advancing rapidly and patterns of the delivery of care in the UK are changing. It must be appreciated that not all maternity centres can care for pregnant womenwith major complications either preceding or developingin pregnancy. If women with underlying medical condi-tions are to share in the advances in medicine, many moremust be referred to tertiary medical centres for their carein pregnancy. Disclosure of interests None.

Psychiatric deaths: specic recommendations As has been recommended before, but re-emphasised here, all women should be asked at their antenatal booking visit about a previous history of psychiatric disorder as well as their current mental health. Women with a previous historyof serious affective disorder or other psychoses should be referred in pregnancy for psychiatric assessment and man-agement even if they are well. A minimum requirement for management should be regular monitoring and supportfor at least 3 months following delivery. Psychiatric services should have priority care pathways for pregnant and postpartum women. These will include a low- ered threshold for referral and intervention, including admission and a rapid response time, for women in late pregnancy and the rst 6 weeks following delivery. Care by multiple psychiatric teams should be avoided. Risk assessments of preg-nant or postpartum women should be modied to take account of risk associated with previous history, the distinctiveclinical picture of perinatal disorders and the violent method of suicide. All mental health trusts should have specialised community perinatal mental teams to care for pregnant and postpartumwomen. These should be closely integrated with regional mother and baby units so that all women requiring psychiatricadmission in late pregnancy and the postpartum period can be admitted together with their infants. Caution needs to be exercised when diagnosing psychiatric disorder if the only symptoms are either unexplained phys- ical symptoms or distress and agitation. This is particularly so when the woman has no prior psychiatric history or when she does not speak English or comes from an ethnic minority. Introduction and background As in previous Reports, this chapter describes the keyfeatures of, and derives lessons from, those maternaldeaths arising directly from a psychiatric condition, sui-cide or accidental overdose of drugs of abuse, as well asdeaths from medical or other causes closely related to apsychiatric disorder. These latter deaths include those from the physical consequences of substance misuse and delays in diagnosis and treatment because of the presenceor assumption of a psychiatric disorder, accidents andviolence. Perinatal psychiatric disorder Psychiatric disorder during pregnancy and following deliv- ery is common, both new episodes and recurrences of pre-existing conditions. Ten percent of new mothers are likely to develop a depressive illness,1of whom between a third and a half will be suffering from a severe depressive illness.2 At least 2% of new mothers will be referred to a psychiatricteam during this time, and two per thousand will sufferfrom a puerperal psychosis. 3 The majority of women who develop mental health problems during pregnancy or following delivery sufferfrom mild depressive illness, often with accompanying anx- iety. Such conditions are probably no more common than at other times. In contrast, the risk of developing a seriousmental illness (bipolar disorder, other affective psychosesand severe depressive illness) is reduced during pregnancybut markedly elevated following childbirth, particularlyduring the rst 3 months. 4 The prevalence of all psychiatric disorders, including substance misuse, schizophrenia and obsessive compulsiveOates, Cantwell 132 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203disorder, is the same at conception as in the nonpregnant female population. Pregnancy is not protective againstrelapses of pre-existing serious mental illness, particularly ifthe woman has stopped her usual medication at the begin-ning of pregnancy. Women who have had a previous episode of a serious mental illness, either following childbirth or at other times,are at an increased risk of developing a postpartum onsetillness, even if they have been well during pregnancy andfor many years previously. This risk is estimated as at leastone in two, that is these women have a 50% chance of itrecurring in a subsequent pergnancy. 5,6The last three Reports7-9also found that over half of the women who died from suicide had a previous history of serious mental illness. It is also known that a family history of bipolar dis-order increases the risk of a woman developing puerperalpsychosis following childbirth. 6 Specialist perinatal psychiatric services Serious psychiatric illnesses in the last few weeks of pregnancy and the rst few weeks following childbirth have a number ofdistinctive clinical features including, importantly, the ten-dency for sudden onset and rapid deterioration. Half of allwomen with puerperal psychoses will have presented by dayseven postnatally, and 90% by 3 months postpartum, 4as highlighted in the last three Reports. This, together withother distinctive symptoms 10and the special needs of women and their infants at this time, has led to national and interna- tional acceptance of the need for special services for perinatalpsychiatric disorder. 11,12This includes the recommendation that new mothers who require admission to a psychiatric unitfollowing birth should be admitted together with their infantto a specialised mother and baby unit and that specialisedcommunity teams are available for those managed at home.The ndings of the last three Enquiries underpin the impor- tance of this strategy, as, with few exceptions, the women who died had been cared for by non-specialised psychiatricteams unfamiliar with these conditions. Maternal suicide Until recently, it had been thought that the maternal sui-cide rate in pregnancy was lower than would be expected, 13 with pregnancy exerting a so-called 'protective effect'. Thelast three Enquiry Reports found that maternal suicide wasmore common than previously thought and was a leadingoverall cause of maternal death. However, suicide duringpregnancy remains relatively uncommon, and the majorityof suicides associated with pregnancy occur following child-birth. Overall, the suicide rate following delivery is little dif-ferent to that among women in the general population, butit may be that for a subgroup of women, those suffering from serious mental illness, the suicide rate is substantiallyelevated. 14One of the reasons for the misunderstanding about maternal suicide is that research over the last40 years has consistently shown that rates based upon coro- ners' verdicts alone are underestimates. For the last four tri- ennia, the Ofce for National Statistics (ONS) has beenable to link mothers' deaths up to 1 year after delivery withrecorded births. This revealed that until 2002, around halfof all maternal suicides had not been reported directly tothis Enquiry. Once this under-reporting was corrected, amore realistic estimate of maternal suicide was possible. Impact of previous enquiries The ndings and recommendations of the last three Enqui-ries 7-9have influenced national policy and guidelines, including the New Horizons Vision for Mental Health ,11The National Service Framework for Children, Young People andMaternity Services , 15and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) Guidelines for antenatal and postnatal mental health .12All recommend that women should be asked at their early pregnancy assessment abouttheir current mental health and a previous history of psychi-atric disorder. Those at risk of developing a serious mentalillness following delivery should be proactively managed.They also recommend that sufcient mother and baby unitsand specialised community perinatal teams should be estab-lished to manage women whose pregnancy or postpartum year is complicated by serious mental illness. The recom- mendations for screening at booking have been widelyimplemented but by no means universally. Specialisedmother and baby units and perinatal psychiatric services arestill not available to women in many parts of the UK. Key ndings 2006-08 Psychiatric disorder is common in pregnancy and afterdelivery, and this is reflected in this Report. Not all of thedeaths described in this Chapter are counted as Indirect deaths due to psychiatric illness. As internationally denedand discussed in Chapter 1, the only deaths which t intothis category are those women who committed suicide dur-ing pregnancy or within 42 days (6 weeks) of the end oftheir pregnancy. There were 13 such women this trien- nium. Deaths from suicide after this time are classied as Late Indirect . This triennial Report includes only those deaths that occurred after 6 weeks and within 6 months(43-182 days) of delivery, of which there were 16. In previ-ous Reports these deaths were followed up for a calendaryear after delivery, which makes a direct comparison withearlier Reports difcult. However, it has been possible todeduce some trends, and these are discussed later.Chapter 11: Deaths from psychiatric causes \u00aa2011 Centre for Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 133Deaths from accidental abuse of substances are classied as Coincidental orLate Coincidental, depending on the timing. There were ten such cases in the trienniumwhich are counted in Chapter 12, one being also associatedwith epilepsy, but the lessons to be derived from them are discussed here. Psychiatric disorder was also associated with a number of deaths from other causes found in many otherChapters of this Report, and these are also discussed here. A total of 67 deaths as the result of, or associated with, psychiatric disorder are discussed in this Chapter but maybe counted elsewhere in this Report if the underlying causeof death was not directly the result of their psychiatric con-dition. These are shown in Table 11.1. Suicide The deaths of 29 women from suicide during their preg-nancy or within the rst 6 months of the end of their preg-nancy were reported to the Enquiry. Thirteen took place inpregnancy or within 42 days of the end of pregnancy andare counted as Indirect deaths by international denition. There were an additional 16 deaths between 43 days and 6 months following delivery, Late Indirect deaths. Table 11.2compares the timing of suicides during pregnancy and the rst 6 months after birth with the previous Enquiries as faras possible. From Table 11.2 it can be seen that there has been an increase in the numbers of suicides before six completed postnatal months since the last two Enquiries, but this is not statistically signicant. The decrease in suicides during pregnancy and the year following delivery reported in 2003-05 was largelyaccounted for by the fall in the numbers of suicides from6 months to 1 year. The numbers of suicides in this cate-gory are not available to the current Enquiry. The women who died The ages of the 29 women who died from suicide rangedfrom 16 to 43 years with a median of 30 years. The major-ity of women (76%) were married or in stable cohabita-tion, and seven were single or living alone. Most women, 22 of the 29 (76%), were either employed or, in four women, housewives with employed partners.Five of the seven who were unemployed were living alone. Of the 22 who were employed, nine (41%) had beenTable 11.1. Timing of deaths from, or associated with, psychiatric causes.

Overall 28% of all women who commit- ted suicide were in professional occupations. Three of the 29women were socially excluded, two of whom were youngsubstance misusers and one an African asylum seeker. The majority, 26 (90%), were White with the others being of Black African, Indian or Pakistani parentage. Around half, 15 of 29 women, died during or after their rst pregnancy,the others having older children. Of the nine suicides whowere substance misusers, seven women were single, ve wereunemployed and three were under the age of 21. Suicides: learning point Over half of the maternal suicides were White, married,employed, living in comfortable circumstances and aged30 years or older. In contrast, suicides associated withsubstance misuse were mostly young, single and unem-ployed.Care needs to be taken not to equate risk of suicidewith socio-economic deprivation. Method of death As in previous Enquiries, the majority of the women diedviolently, 87%. Over half died from hanging or multipleinjuries from jumping from a height, as shown in Table 11.3. The method of suicide across this and the three previous Enquiries for which these data were available iscomparable. Diagnosis For all women, there was sufcient information to make adenite or probable psychiatric diagnosis. These are shownin Table 11.4. A diagnosis of serious mental illness, affec- tive psychoses or severe depressive illness was present in 17 (59%) of the women, in keeping with the ndings of previ-ous Enquiries. Nine (31%) had a primary diagnosis of drugmisuse. The range of psychiatric disorders was less thanpreviously described. There were three suicides with a diag- nosis of severe grief reaction, two of which followed the loss of early pregnancy and one the death of a partner. For eight of the women, their clinicians made the wrong initial psychiatric diagnosis; in three women the GP and inve the psychiatric teams. In these eight women, there wasevidence in the notes of signs and symptoms of a severedepressive illness with psychotic features or, for twowomen, of mixed affective psychosis. However, the diagno- ses made were of anxiety or moderate depression, as well as one occurrence of puerperal psychosis, adjustment disor-der. These initial diagnoses had consequences for the leveland intensity of psychiatric care. For some women, thecommunity mental health team turned down the referralbecause it had been presented as anxiety. For example: A woman died from violent causes some weeks after deliv- ery. Throughout her normal pregnancy she became increas-ingly anxious and, by the end of pregnancy, had bizarredelusional beliefs about her health. At no point was psychi-atric referral considered. Following delivery, her mental state deteriorated, and she self-presented to the Emergency Department agitated and expressing bizarre beliefs abouther health. Her symptoms were clearly documented at herpsychiatric assessment but a diagnosis was made of an anx-iety state. The community mental health team to whom shewas referred declined to accept her. She died shortly after-wards. Previous history As shown in Table 11.5, 19 (66%) of the women who com- mitted suicide had a psychiatric history, of whom six had ahistory of bipolar or schizo-affective disorder. Three women who died in pregnancy were not booked, so there was no opportunity to identify this risk. Only nine (47%)of those at risk of a recurrence of their disorder followingdelivery were identied, and in only four (21%) was thereevidence that a plan was in place to manage the risk ofpostpartum recurrence. These ndings, as in previous Enquiries, show that the identication of risk and its management remains a prob- lem. For example:Table 11.3.

Althoughshe was being treated for depression by her GP, this infor-mation was not passed on to her midwife. In later preg- nancy she became acutely depressed and required admission to a psychiatric unit. She failed to attend for follow up afterdischarge, and it seems that no attempts were made toreach her in the community. Her community midwife wasunaware that she was not receiving psychiatric care afterdelivery. She died by violent means. Women with a signicant past history face a 50% risk of recurrence. This should be identied at booking andappropriate management plans should be put in placeeven though the women may be well at the time. Theyalso require close support and monitoring following delivery. There is still an apparent lack of understanding by general psychiatric services of the high risk of post-partum relapse and the need for continuing care in suchwomen. Previous psychiatric history and suicide: learning points The majority of women who suffer maternal deaths from suicide have a past history of serious affective dis-order. Women with previous bipolar disorder, otheraffective psychoses and severe depressive illness face asubstantial risk of recurrence following delivery even ifthey have been well during pregnancy.Previous psychiatric history must be identied in earlypregnancy. Psychiatrists should proactively manage this risk and, at the very least, frequently monitor and sup- port these women in the early weeks following delivery. The psychiatric services provided Eighteen (62%) of the women had been involved with psy-chiatric services during their last maternity as shown in Table 11.6.Of the eight women admitted to psychiatric units, one was admitted to a general adult psychiatric unit during pregnancy and one was admitted following a terminationof pregnancy. Six of the women who delivered, includingtwo who were eventually admitted to a mother and babyunit, had been admitted to a general psychiatric unit andseparated from their babies. For three of the motherswho had delivered, there was no evidence that admissionto a mother and baby unit had been considered. In one woman with an early onset puerperal psychosis, following the admission to an adult psychiatric unit without herbaby, the request for transfer to an out-of-area motherand baby unit was turned down by her Primary CareTrust. Some of these cases demonstrate the problems with aftercare by non-specialised community care services thatdid not seem to appreciate the continued risks of relapse in these mothers. They also provide examples of the impor- tance of GPs communicating with midwives and the needfor direct admission to a mother and baby unit of womenwith a puerperal psychosis. The involvement of a specia-lised perinatal service might have improved their engage-ment with psychiatric care. Eleven women, including the two who were admitted to mother and baby units, were cared for in the community by general psychiatric teams rather than specialised com- munity perinatal teams. There was evidence of delay inobtaining admission to mother and baby units whenrequired, whether through local availability, appreciation ofseverity or, as has been mentioned, a refusal to fund suchcare. All of these cases demonstrate the importance of hav-ing both specialised perinatal community teams as well asprompt access to mother and baby units with whom they have close working links. Substandard care For the majority of women (69%) known to be involved with psychiatric services in their current maternity, psychiatricTable 11.5.

Eleven women weremanaged by general adult psychiatric services and had beentreated by multiple psychiatric teams and/or had an inade-quate risk assessment. In four women, both areas of concern were found. Another four women had a mistaken initial diagnosis. In most women there was also evidence to suggest that psychiatric teams caring for the women had not appreci-ated the severity of the women's illness, as indicated by theinitial diagnosis and the speed, level and frequency of psy-chiatric intervention. For example: A woman had a past history of schizo-affective psychosis, and all her previous episodes were clearly related to reduc-tions in her medication. She had also had a previous post-partum episode, during which she made a life-threateningsuicide attempt. She had been well on medication for many years, and the history was identied in early pregnancy. Although she remained in close contact with psychiatric ser-vices throughout her pregnancy, the maternity servicesappeared not to know how serious her past illnesses hadbeen. Following delivery she was seen frequently by a gen-eral adult community mental health team. A few daysbefore her death, she became acutely unwell with bizarrebehaviour, delusional ideas and a preoccupation with her previous suicide attempt. She deteriorated on a daily basis, and two more psychiatric teams were introduced into hercare. She was then seen very frequently, but the stated aimof her management was 'to keep her at home'. She diedfrom self immolation within a few hours of the last visit byher community nurse. This woman had a previous history of a puerperal psy- chosis and a very serious suicide attempt. Her risk of recur-rence was high. Both her previous attempt and her currentpreoccupation with suicide placed her at high risk,increased by the rapid onset and deterioration of her con- dition and a recent change in her medication. Admission to a psychiatric unit at the onset of her illness might havealtered the outcome. This is also an example of the involve-ment of multiple psychiatric teams and the lack of bothlocal specialised community perinatal mental health teamsand a mother and baby unit. Puerperal psychosis: learning points Puerperal psychosis (including recurrence of bipolar dis-order and other affective psychoses) is relatively uncom-mon in daily psychiatric practice. The distinctive clinicalfeatures, including sudden onset and rapid deteriora-tion, may be unfamiliar to nonspecialists.Psychiatric services should have a lowered threshold to intervention including admission. They should ensure continuity and avoid care by multiple psychiatric teams.Specialised perinatal psychiatric services, both inpatientand community, should be available. Safeguarding (child protection) social service involvement Nine of the 29 women (31%) who committed suicide had been referred to social services during their pregnancy,including eight of the 18 receiving psychiatric care. In vewomen, the referral was made because the woman was apsychiatric patient rather than because of specic concernsabout the welfare of the infant. It was apparent from their notes that fear that the child would be removed was a prominent feature of the women's condition and probablyled them to have difculties in engaging with psychiatriccare: A mother who died some weeks after delivery had had contested custody disputes over her older children. Shehad a previous history of reactive depression related toher circumstances, which had been treated by the GP.Her psychological and social problems were identied inearly pregnancy, and she received excellent care from hermidwife throughout. Following delivery her midwife iden- tied a depressive illness, and the GP reacted promptly and prescribed an antidepressant. She would not take thisbecause she was concerned about breastfeeding, despitethe midwife reassuring her with information from theDrug Information Service. There was excellent communi-cation between the midwife, GP and health visitor. Someweeks later she deteriorated, and the GP urgently referredher to mental health services. At the same time she was also referred to the child protection service, which was 'routine in that area'. The general adult home treatmentteam found her reluctant to engage, and she was fright-ened that her children would be removed. Admission wasrecommended but declined. Shortly afterwards, she pre-sented to the Emergency Department having swallowed acorrosive substance but did not reveal that she had alsotaken paracetamol. She was admitted to a general psychi- atric unit but physically deteriorated, revealing that she had taken an overdose of paracetamol, from which shedied shortly afterwards. This woman received excellent care from her midwife and GP. However, it is obvious that this woman was terried of losing the care of her children. This fearinfluenced her cooperation with the treatments whichmight have prevented her death. A specialised communityperinatal team might have been more sensitive to theseissues.Chapter 11: Deaths from psychiatric causes \u00aa2011 Centre for Enquiries (CMACE), 1-203 137Child protection issues: learning points Morbid ideas of maternal incompetence and danger to the infant are a common feature of maternal mental ill-ness, as is a fear that their children will be removed.Referral to safeguarding teams should not be routinewhen mothers develop a mental illness but should takeplace as the result of a risk assessment. When referral to the safeguarding team is necessary because the infant has or is likely to suffer from harm,then extra vigilance and care are required. Referral tosocial services may otherwise result in avoidance of careand necessary treatment and may increase the risk ofdeterioration in the mother's mental health and suicide. Internal reviews In only ve of these women was an internal review by psy-chiatric services made available to the Enquiry. Theserevealed a lack of understanding of the risk factors presentand the points of intervention that might have altered the outcome. For example, in a woman who set re to her- self the review was inadequate. She had a history of affec-tive psychosis including a postpartum near-fatal suicideattempt, and, during her nal illness, she deterioratedrapidly and was preoccupied with her previous suicideattempt. The internal review found no evidence that thiswoman was at risk of suicide, that nothing further couldhave been done to have prevented her death and that her death had nothing to do with her pregnancy. Substance misuse Substance misuse has increased substantially among women over the past 30 years, with 2-3% of children in Englandand Wales having a parent with drug or alcohol problems. 16 Almost two-thirds of drug-using women entering treatmentare parents, but only half have custody of their children. 17 Women who are substance users and who attend treatmentprogrammes are likely to have better antenatal care and bet-ter general health than those who do not. 18 Findings for 2006-08 Thirty-ve deaths which occurred in women who wereknown to be substance misusers in pregnancy and/or therst 6 months following delivery were considered by the psychiatric assessors. The causes of their deaths are sum- marised in Table 11.7. Nine of these women are counted above in the section on suicide. In addition, ten womendied from an accidental overdose of drugs of addiction;although they are discussed here, they are counted as Coin- cidental orLate Coincidental deaths in Chapter 12.A further 13 women died from medical conditions caused by or attributed to their drug problem. They are counted in the relevant chapters but further discussed here.Three more women died from accidents caused by theirdrug addiction. At least two-thirds of the women weresocially excluded, and a substantial number were latebookers. Some had received no antenatal care. There areexamples of outstanding care with strenuous efforts atengagement by health professionals. However, in a number of women, there was evidence of poor information sharing and lack of recognition of continued use. Heroin was themost commonly used drug, but polysubstance misuse wasalso common. Suicide in drug-dependent women Nine drug-dependent women committed suicide; this hasalso been discussed above. Three women died during preg- nancy, two after delivery within 42 days and four later than this. Six of these women had co-morbid conditions: ve hadadjustment or grief reactions, and one, a woman who wasabusing over the counter analgesia, had a somatoform paindisorder (persistent medically unexplained pain). Five hadchild protection case conferences, and in three cases, the sui-cide occurred shortly after a decision to remove the childinto care. In contrast to nonsubstance users who died by suicide, these women were younger, and ve were in their teens. All of these teenage deaths were by violent means. Eight out of the nine had a clearly documented past his- tory of substance misuse, but in only three women was thisidentied in early pregnancy and only two women weremanaged by drug services. In the remainder, women weremanaged by drug liaison midwives alone or with the GP. Accidental overdose of recreational drugs There were ten deaths in this category. Two women diedduring pregnancy, three between delivery and 42 days andanother ve within 43 days and 6 months. All had estab-lished histories of substance misuse, but in only ve wasthis identied in early pregnancy. In four women, the rele-vant information was either not passed to or not sought bythe midwife, by the GP or social services, and the lastTable 11.7.

In only three women was a specia- lised drug team involved in the maternity care. Child protection case conferences were held in eight of the cases: in four of these antenatal care was then avoidedafter the case conference, and three women died very shortly after a decision was made to remove the baby. For example: A young woman died from butane inhalation later after delivery. She had a long history of heroin addiction, andher partner was also a heroin addict. Her substance misuse had been implicated in the premature delivery and neonatal death of an older child. She was involved with a specialistmidwife and the drug addiction team during the indexpregnancy and was referred to social services. She had onlyhad a very few antenatal visits before giving birth to a sickbaby who spent some months on a neonatal unit. Themother received frequent visits from the specialised midwifefollowing delivery, but there was no evidence of increased contact from the drug addiction services. Shortly before her death a decision was made to remove the child into fostercare, and she then increased both her street drug and meth-adone consumption. There was no evidence of any commu-nication between social services and the drug addictionteam. It is evident that this woman felt guilty and upset that her addiction had led to the death of one child and the dis-ability of a second. It demonstrates the need for extra sur-veillance and support for women with substance misusewho are involved with childcare proceedings. Medical complications of substance misuse In addition, there were 13 women whose deaths werereported to the Enquiry and in which substance misuseplayed a signicant contribution to the cause of death\u2014two in pregnancy, nine between delivery and 42 days andtwo later. Substance misuse was not only implicated in theaetiology of the fatal condition but also influenced the care the women received. These deaths are counted in the rele- vant Chapters. There were three from bacterial endocardi-tis, two from cardiomyopathy, one from myocardialinfarction related to recent heavy cocaine use and one fromSudden Adult Death Syndrome counted in Chapter 9.Three deaths from bronchopneumonia and three related tothe physical consequences of alcohol, including liver diseaseand bleeding oesophageal varices are counted in Chapter 10. Ten of the 13 women were heroin abusers, two were alcohol dependent and one was a cocaine user. In a few instances, symptoms of the terminal illness were misattributed to those of drug withdrawal, for examplefrom cardiomyopathy or cerebral haemorrhage. It was evi-dent that this misattribution led to delayed diagnosis andtreatment, but it is uncertain whether this affected the out-come. For example:A mother died after delivery from a cerebral aneurysm. She had been an intravenous heroin user for many years butwas not treated by a drug addiction team, obtaining herheroin and methadone from friends. At booking she activelydenied problems with drug misuse, but later in the preg- nancy her GP told the midwife of her intravenous heroin and methadone use, at which point she was referred tosocial services. Following this, she avoided antenatal care.She presented to maternity services as an emergency inmid-pregnancy with a history of collapse and dizziness,which was attributed to her substance misuse and she wassent home. A few weeks later she presented again with ahistory of collapse and severe headache. It is clear from the notes that initially this was thought to be related to her drug abuse. The full extent of her substance misuse onlybecame clear after an assessment by an addiction specialist.Within a few hours, after an epileptic t, she was found tohave a bleeding aneurysm but died following neurosurgery. This demonstrates the problem in assuming physical symptoms are the result of substance misuse. With thiswoman, the diagnosis was delayed for some weeks, but it isunclear whether an earlier diagnosis would have affectedthe outcome. This is also an example of the avoidance ofantenatal care following referral to social services. In all but two (85%) of these 13 women there was evi- dence of avoiding maternity care. Two women were un- booked, and the remainder either booked very late oravoided the majority of their antenatal contacts. Forseven, a child protection case conference had been held,and four women died shortly after their child had beenremoved. Road trafc accidents and house re There were three further deaths in pregnancy, in two ofwhich the death occurred shortly after a decision was madeto initiate childcare proceedings. Two were from road traf-c accidents while intoxicated from either alcohol and can-nabis or with heroin. The third death, from smokeinhalation in a house re, took place towards the end ofpregnancy in a woman who had a history of depression,domestic violence and alcohol misuse. Substance misuse: learning points Women may conceal or minimise the nature and extentof their substance use, often fearing a censoriousapproach or child protection involvement. Early infor-mation sharing between the GP, maternity and addic- tion services is essential. Management should include drug monitoring measures, such as regular urine screen-ing, particularly where substitute prescribing is used.Chapter 11: Deaths from psychiatric causes \u00aa2011 Centre Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 139All women who are substance users should have inte- grated specialist care. Women should not be managed solely by their GP or midwife. Integrated care shouldinclude addictions professionals, child safeguarding, andspecialist midwifery and obstetrics. Other deaths from medical conditions associated with psychiatric disorder In addition to the 13 women who died from medical condi- tions associated with their substance abuse, a further 12women died who had an underlying psychiatric disorder thatmay have contributed to their terminal condition or influ-enced the care received. Two of these occurred during preg-nancy, seven after delivery and there were three Late cases. The deaths of three women from venous thromboembo- lism are counted and discussed in Chapter 2. One motherhad a needle phobia which led to her refusing blood testsand thrombo-prophylaxis and another, who had an emo-tionally unstable personality disorder, was unable to self-administer thrombo-prophylaxis and avoided postnatal careafter her child was removed by social services. A womanwith a diagnosis of schizophrenia died while receiving inpa- tient psychiatric care: her antipsychotic medication was associated with weight gain and she was a heavy smoker.In a fourth case, the developing symptoms of physical dis-ease were misattributed to psychiatric causes. In somecases, these women also failed to attend for regular antena-tal care. Four deaths were from neurological causes and are counted in Chapter 10. The rst was from sudden unex- plained death in epilepsy in a woman who had an emo- tionally unstable personality disorder and poor compliancewith care and anti-epileptic medication. The second died inlate pregnancy following an epileptic t. She had paranoidschizophrenia. Both her epilepsy and schizophrenia haddeteriorated during pregnancy. Her epilepsy was managedby her psychiatrist. The third death involved a subarach-noid haemorrhage in a distressed asylum seeker with post- traumatic stress disorder whose developing symptoms were misattributed to psychiatric causes. In the fourth, a womandied from encephalopathy whose symptoms were misattrib-uted to psychiatric causes over a prolonged period of time. Also counted in the Other Indirect deaths chapter is a death in pregnancy of a woman who died from miliarytuberculosis but whose anorexia and weight loss was misat-tributed to psychiatric causes. A further death from pneu- monia secondary to autoimmune disorder occurred. For many weeks this woman's symptoms were misattributed todepression. There were two Direct deaths. The rst, counted in Chapter 3, was in a woman with mild learning disabilityand epilepsy whose early symptoms were misattributed to anxiety and agitation, and another woman died from post-partum haemorrhage and is counted in Chapter 4. Thisdeath, which received media coverage, was associated withneonaticide in a woman without any previous psychiatric history: An older, religious, single professional woman with no apparent social problems or previous psychiatric history diedfrom exsanguination as the result of postpartum haemor- rhage. She had concealed her pregnancy and delivered unassisted at home. She died of haemorrhage and a deadinfant was found at home. This woman demonstrates the classical features of neona- ticide: previously good character, no psychiatric history, nosocial services involvement and a stable occupation. Shehad a concealed pregnancy and unassisted delivery, andthere was a lack of awareness of close family members,work colleagues and health professionals that she was preg-nant. In these cases, the infant is either abandoned or diesshortly after delivery. The lack of a psychiatric diagnosis is also typical, but it is likely that at the time she was suffer- ing from an acute dissociative state. If she had survived,she would have been charged with infanticide (neonati-cide). This is the only record of infanticide in this Enquiry. Misattribution of cause In six of these 12 examples of physical disease there was adelay in diagnosis and appropriate treatment being given, sometimes over prolonged periods of time. This was because of misattribution of the signs and symptoms of amedical condition to a psychiatric disorder. In two women,an acute confusional state, a symptom of the underlyingmedical condition, was misattributed to a functional psy-chiatric disorder leading to repeated requests for psychiatricassessment and a delay in diagnosis and appropriate treat-ment. In four others there was no signicant psychiatric disorder, but initial difculties in making a substantive physical diagnosis had led to an assumption that the symp-toms must be of psychological origin. Difculties in eatingwere described as 'food avoidance' and 'refusing to eat' andwere thought to be an eating disorder. Difculties in hold-ing a conversation were described as 'refusing to speak'and thought to be depression. Distress and agitation weredescribed as 'behavioural'. As an example of this: A woman died of an autoimmune disorder that had been diagnosed before pregnancy. Her medical diagnosis initiallypresented with lethargy and malaise. Despite this, and herlack of a psychiatric history, her complaints of feeling increasingly unwell were attributed by the GP to depression in mid-pregnancy, and she was referred to a psychiatrist.She deteriorated and, when admitted to a maternityOates, Cantwell 140 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203hospital, was described as 'known to be suffering from depression'. She was quiet and withdrawn, not eating ordrinking. This was described as 'depression' and 'oddbehaviour'. She was seen by a psychiatric nurse who notedher to be profoundly physically unwell with no evidence of depression. Nonetheless, the view of her suffering from a psychiatric condition continued. Following delivery therewas evidence from the notes that she developed an acuteconfusional state. Again this was attributed to depression.Shortly afterwards she collapsed and died. From the symptoms described by the psychiatric nurse and in her obstetric records, it seems unlikely that she wassuffering from a depressive illness. Her symptoms were theresult of her deteriorating physical state and perhaps tocerebral involvement of her autoimmune disease. The mi-sattribution of her symptoms and the preoccupation withher psychiatric diagnosis over a number of weeks led to a delay in diagnosis and effective treatment. These deaths involving misattribution of physical symp- toms to psychological causes are, sadly, in keeping with thendings of previous Reports. Misattribution of physical symptoms to psychiatric illness: learning points The misattribution of physical symptoms and of distress and agitation to psychiatric disorder has led to a failureto investigate and delays in diagnosis and treatment ofserious underlying medical conditions in a number ofdeaths.Caution needs to be exercised when diagnosing psychi-atric disorder if the only symptoms are either unex- plained physical symptoms or distress and agitation. This is particularly so when the woman has no priorpsychiatric history or when she does not speak Englishor comes from an ethnic minority. Conclusion There has been no signicant reduction in maternal suicidewithin 6 months of delivery since 1997. As in previous En-quiries, over half of the women who died from suicidewere older, married women in comfortable circumstanceswith a previous psychiatric history who were well during pregnancy. Despite the fact that they faced a substantial risk of a recurrence of their condition following delivery,they did not receive preconception counselling, their riskwas not identied at booking nor was it actively managed.Again in line with the ndings of the previous Enquiries,women in contact with psychiatric services were beingmanaged by general services who appeared not to befamiliar with the importance of previous history, nor with the distinctive clinical features of serious postpartummental illness. Also sadly, in line with the ndings ofprevious Enquiries, the majority of maternal suicides diedviolently. The characteristics of women who are substance misus- ers who died either from suicide or other causes con-trasted with the other psychiatric maternal deaths. Theywere, in the main, young, single, unemployed and sociallydeprived. A new nding of this Enquiry, reflecting the recent changes in the delivery of psychiatric services, was theinvolvement of multiple psychiatric teams in the short per- iod between the onset of the woman's condition and her suicide. The lack of continuity of care, further complicatedby the criteria and protocols involved in each differentteam's acceptance of a patient, seems in some cases to havecontributed to the outcome. This, together with other nd-ings, lends further support for the establishment of specia-lised perinatal services, both inpatient and community, forthe care of women whose pregnancy or postpartum period is complicated by serious mental illness. If the ndings of this and the last three Enquiries were to be implemented, not only would some mothers' lives besaved, but the care of those who live would be improved.

Deaths apparently unrelated to pregnancy: specic recommendations This Enquiry continues to recommend that routine enquiry, 'Asking the question', should be made about domestic abuse, either when taking a social history at booking or at another opportune point during a woman's antenatalperiod. Midwives should give high priority to 'Asking the question' and to giving information to all women about domestic abuse. The antenatal booking appointment may be the appropriate time to 'ask the question' or the mid- wife may decide to delay until the following appointment when a relationship has already been established. All women should be seen alone at least once during the antenatal period to facilitate disclosure of domestic abuse.Any member of the maternity team who notices that a woman has an injury, for example a black eye, should asksympathetically, but directly, about how this occurred and be prepared to follow up this enquiry with information,advice and support as needed. All women should be advised to wear a three-point seat belt throughout pregnancy, with the lap strap placed as lowas possible beneath the 'bump' lying across the thighs and the diagonal shoulder strap above the 'bump' lying between the breasts. The seat belt should be adjusted to t as snugly and comfortably as possible, and if necessary the seat should be adjusted. Introduction This chapter considers those deaths reported to the Enquirythat occurred in pregnant or recently delivered mothers from causes apparently unrelated to their pregnancy. Such deaths, which occur during pregnancy or up to 42 com-pleted days (6 weeks) after the end of pregnancy are inter-nationally dened as fortuitous, although this Report usesthe term Coincidental. Deaths occurring between 43 and 364 completed days after the end of the pregnancy are clas-sied as Late maternal deaths and are not included in the calculations of mortality rates or ratios (For full denitions see the Introduction to this Report). Late deaths can be subdivided into those from Late Direct ,Late Indirect and Late Coincidental causes. These denitions are discussed further in the Introductory section to this Report. As heralded in the last Report, this Enquiry for 2006-08 has focused its efforts on assessing Direct and Indirectdeaths occurring within 42 days of delivery, and not all Coincidental deaths will have been identied and assessed. Certainly, most Late Coincidental deaths are not included because they were excluded from assessment this trien-nium. However, all nine Late Direct deaths from preg- nancy-related causes were identied and assessed, as were24Late Indirect deaths, largely from suicide and cardiomy- opathy, which occurred up to 6 months after delivery.These deaths are important to include in this Report because they can be the result of often identiable and treatable conditions aggravated or induced by pregnancy.Indeed, in the next update on international denitions formaternal mortality, it is possible that these two causes ofdeath will be classied as being the result of Direct causes. Although Coincidental orLate deaths, in international terms, are not considered as true maternal deaths and donot contribute to the calculations for any internationalChapter 12: Deaths apparently unrelated to pregnancy \u00aa2011 Centre for and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 143maternal mortality rates or ratios, they may contain impor- tant messages for the providers of maternity care. Clini-cally, the lessons may include basic principles for themanagement of pregnant or recently delivered women withunderlying medical or psychiatric conditions. From a pub- lic-health perspective, the continuing assessment of such deaths re-enforces the need for information on the correctuse of seat belts in pregnancy, and, perhaps most impor-tantly, the identication and management of pregnantwomen who suffer from physical, verbal or emotionalabuse. Issues related to domestic abuse, recommendationsand suggested guidelines have been fully described in spe-cic chapters in the previous two Reports of this Enquiry. The main ndings for this triennium, which remain largely unchanged, are discussed at the end of this Chapter (inAnnex 12.1), and readers are referred to previous Reportsand other references for more detailed information. Summary of key ndings for 2006-08 Coincidental deaths In this triennium, the deaths of 50 women who died of Coincidental causes either during their pregnancy or within 42 days of delivery were reported to this Enquiry, com-pared with 55 for the previous triennium. As in previousReports, and as shown in Table 12.1, the largest overall cat- egory were deaths due to 'unnatural' causes, largely roadtrafc accidents, murder or unintentional overdoses ofstreet drugs. Some women who died from other medical causes such as pneumonia are included in this section, as their pregnancies (invariably at an extremely early gesta-tion) were only discovered during the autopsy. The deathsof nine women who died from Coincidental malignancies are discussed in Chapter 10 and those associated with sub-stance abuse are discussed in Chapter 11. By chance, andnot representative of the number of women who died fromLate Coincidental causes, the Enquiry was notied of nine such deaths this triennium; seven were the result of over-doses of street drugs and two were from medical condi-tions. These are not used in statistical calculations. As with previous Reports, and other causes of death, many of the women whose deaths are counted here were vulnerable and socially excluded. The general lessons to be drawn fromthis group of mothers have been discussed in Chapter 1. Road trafc accidents The Enquiry received reports on the deaths of 17 womenwho died as the result of road trafc accidents during preg-nancy or within 6 weeks of delivery during this triennium. In two deaths, the women were under the influence of drugs or alcohol, in one of which the mother had recentlyhad her baby taken into care. In the opinion of the asses-sors, there is the possibility that this accident may havebeen intentional. In another example where suicide mightalso have been a possibility, a mother in mid-pregnancywas suffering from depression and had required hospitalisa-tion following assaults from her violent partner, who had recently given her a sexually transmitted disease. She had also had a number of previous terminations, all signs ofhaving a violent, controlling partner. Two pregnant women were pedestrians hit by motor vehicles. One, who was hit on a motorway, had a chaoticlifestyle, was addicted to street drugs and had all her previ-ous children taken into care. She was approaching anotherchild protection conference when she died. Here, too, the question remains about why she was walking on a motor- way in the rst place. All but two of the women were still pregnant when they died, and in only one woman was there clear evidence thatshe was not wearing a seat belt. In four women, a peri-mortem caesarean section was performed in the EmergencyDepartment. The gestations ranged from 24 to 41 weeks;none of the babies survived. The advice for the use of seat belts in pregnancy is given in the overall recommendations at the start of this chapter. Late deaths As previously discussed, apart from all nine Late Direct and 24Late Indirect deaths assessed as having been related to pregnancy, notably because of puerperal psychosis and car-diomyopathy, from which important lessons for maternity care can still be drawn, other deaths in women in their rst postnatal year have not generally been assessed this trien-nium. There were, however, nine examples of such Late Coincidental deaths for which assessments were made, lar- gely to exclude them being assessed as the result of Late Indirect causes. Therefore, apart from Direct and certain Indirect Late deaths, due to the more limited assessment of most other later deaths this triennium, these numbers andTable 12.1.

The Late Direct and Indirect deaths known to the Enquiry are shown in Table 12.2. Late Direct deaths In this Report, nine mothers died later than 42 days after delivery from Direct causes or from complications arising from the initial direct obstetric event. According to interna-tional convention and International Classication of Dis-eases 10th edition coding, these deaths are not counted asDirect deaths in maternal mortality statistics, but, because they contain important lessons for clinical care, the Enquiryassessors review such cases, and the lessons to be learnt from them are discussed in the appropriate clinical chapter.Table 12.2.

Domestic abuse Domestic abuse: new and existing learning points from 2006 to 2008 This Enquiry continues to recommend that routine enquiry, 'Asking the question', should be made about domestic abuse, either when taking a social history at booking or at another opportune point during a woman's antenatalperiod. Midwives should give high priority to 'Asking the question' and to giving information to all women aboutdomestic abuse. The antenatal booking appointment may be the appropriate time to 'ask the question' or the mid-wife may decide to delay until the following appointment when a relationship has already been established.All women should be seen alone at least once during the antenatal period to facilitate disclosure of domestic abuse.Any member of the maternity team who notices that a woman has an injury, for example a black eye, should ask sympathetically, but directly, about how this occurred and be prepared to follow up this enquiry with information, advice and support as needed.The recent report Responding to Violence against Women and Children recommended, as does this Report, that health service providers and purchasers should have clear policies on the use of interpretation services that ensure thatwomen and children are able to disclose violence and abuse condently and condentially. 1 When routine questioning is introduced, this must be accompanied by: The establishment of an appropriate method of recording the response on the woman's records, in such a way thatprotects her from further harm from the perpetrator, if abuse is disclosed. The development of local strategies for referral to a local multidisciplinary support network to which the woman canbe referred if necessary. Information about local sources of help and emergency help lines, such as those provided by Women's Aid, should bedisplayed in suitable places in antenatal clinics, for example in the women's toilets, or printed as a routine at the bottomof hand-held maternity notes or cooperation cards.Women who are known to suffer domestic abuse should not be regarded as 'low risk'. They should be offered care thatinvolves other agencies and disciplines as needed for the individual's situation, within a supportive environment. If theychoose midwifery-led care, the midwife should receive support and advice from an experienced colleague, for example the Named Midwife for Safeguarding or a Supervisor of Midwives. It must be remembered that health professionals, too, are victims of abuse and that domestic abuse occurs across allsocial classes and within all ethnic groups. Background Domestic abuse has been the subject of separate chapters intwo previous Reports, 2,3and readers are referred to them for a more detailed background information as well as the other,more recent, documents that are referenced in this Chapter. Domestic abuse has been dened as: Any incident of threatening behaviour or abuse (psychologi- cal, physical, sexual, nancial or emotional) between adultswho are or have been intimate partners or family members,regardless of gender or sexuality. 4 The term 'domestic abuse' is used in preference to 'domestic violence' because the latter could be interpretedas relating to physical abuse alone. It also covers issues thatmainly concern women from minority ethnic backgrounds,such as forced marriage, female genital mutilation/cutting and so-called 'honour crimes'. Previous Reports have highlighted the issue of domestic abuse, and even murder, in pregnancy or after delivery. Asa result, a number of local and national initiatives wereintroduced, including sensitive routine questioning aboutexisting abuse during the antenatal period. One publica-tion, Responding to Domestic Abuse, a Handbook for Health Professionals , 4arose directly from these recommendations. The mothers affected by abuse: 2006-08 During the 3 years 2006-08, 34 of the women who died from any cause had features of domestic abuse. It is impor-tant to remember that although the perpetrator is mostoften the woman's partner, it may also be other familymembers. This was the case for the majority of the 11women who were murdered, the abuse was fatal. Many ofAnnex 12.1. Domestic abuse 146 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203the other women who died from a range of other causes had proactively self-reported domestic abuse to a healthcareprofessional either before or during their pregnancy. Over-all, 38% of these mothers were poor attenders or late book-ers for antenatal care as shown in Table 12.3. This is an improvement of the 56% reported in the last Report. Mothers who themselves were subject to sexual abuse in childhood In a recent report from the Violence against Women and Children Task Force, 21% of girls under 16 experience sex-ual abuse during childhood. 1It is estimated that across the UK there are upwards of ve million adult women who experienced some form of sexual abuse during childhood.1 While assessing all of the deaths available to this Report, 17 mothers were identied who had declared that they hadbeen sexually abused by a relative, usually their father, inchildhood. Most of these women had chaotic or vulnerablelifestyles and two, maybe three, were prostitutes. Seven ofthese died of Direct and Indirect causes, and the others gen- erally died from later suicides or overdoses of drugs of addiction. The mothers who were murdered The 11 deaths of murdered women known to this Enquiry must be regarded as a minimum, because in this trienniumthe case ascertainment was mainly focused on identifyingDirect and Indirect deaths. However, the general lessons to be learnt from the cases that were available for assessment underline the need for vigilance, especially when there may be a high index of suspicion. All but three of the women were killed while still preg- nant. One, a prostitute, died at the hands of a serial killer,and another was killed by a neighbour following a domesticdispute. A third, a recently arrived young school-age bridewho spoke no English, was stabbed by her husband's girl- friend. Seven other women were killed by their partners,one of whom then took his own life in prison. In anothercase, the circumstances surrounding the death of a motherwho was alleged to have died in a house re were highly suspicious and suggestive of murder by the known, violent husband. Of these women, ve died early in pregnancy andhad not yet been 'booked' by the midwife so did not havean opportunity to disclose domestic abuse. One of thesewomen was in a known violent relationship. Two of thesewomen had already been referred for maternity care bytheir GPs, neither of whom mentioned their known poorsocial circumstances and past histories of abuse in the referral letter. None of the women who were booked for care disclosed abuse, and one was not asked. Five of theseven women killed by their partners were from minorityethnic groups, of which two had recently arrived in the UKand their husbands or family members acted as their trans-lators. For example: A newly arrived young bride who spoke no English and whose own relatives lived on another continent had no fam-ily support at all. She booked late, but her midwives wereaware that her husband was extremely violent because shewas already known to social services. She repeatedlyattended the Emergency Department with abdominal pains and vague symptoms, but these were not taken seriously. A few weeks after she delivered by caesarean section, she wasfound at home with extremely severe burns and died shortlyafterwards. Her husband's relatives, who seem to have col-luded with him throughout, stated that this was the resultof an accident in the kitchen, a fact that those reporting hercase to this Enquiry seem to have accepted at face value. In the opinion of the assessors, this woman was either murdered by her husband or committed suicide becauseTable 12.3.

Domestic abuseshe could no longer live in an intolerable situation. The lack of understanding of this possibility by the healthcarestaff who completed the report form shows that few, if any,lessons appear to have been learnt from this tragic case. In another case where the woman did not speak English: An asylum seeker who also spoke no English and whose husband was her interpreter was stabbed by him whilepregnant. She had repeatedly failed to attend for care andhad had only one antenatal visit. Her nonattendances were not followed up. She had, however, attended the local Emergency Department complaining of constant vaginalirritation and discharge. These are classic signs of abuse. A lack of suitable interpreters is one of the key ndings of this Report. All health services should have clear policieson the use of interpretation services that ensure womenand children are able to disclose violence and abuse con-dently and condentially. As a woman said in the TaskForce Report 1'Even if the perpetrator isn't with you, he sends one of his family members with you. And in thename of honour you can't even talk about it. Especially if they say, ''I'm going to interpret because she can't speak English''.' Abused women who died from other causes Thirty-four women were known or declared themselves tobe subject to domestic abuse, three of whom were living inrefuges for abused women. Many exhibited one or more ofthe classic signs of abuse, but all too often these appear to have been missed or glossed over with little support pro- vided. For example: Among the cases of abuse was a woman who had been brought to this country as a foreign bride and had nowhere to turn, despite disclosing her problems to the midwives car- ing for her and having the courage to report the assaults tothe police, who subsequently arrested her husband; he wasconvicted and imprisoned. She eventually made it throughher own efforts to a refuge, where she died of an underlyingmedical condition. As shown in earlier Reports 2,3and repeated here, the fea- tures of domestic abuse are shown in Box 12.2. Disclosure of interests None.

Provide pregnant women and new mothers with information about the prevention and signs and symptoms of possi-ble genital tract sepsis and the need to seek advice early if concerned, as well as the importance of good personal hygiene. Assess the mother's risk adequately throughout the continuum of pregnancy and the postnatal period, re-assessing as needed if circumstances change. Refer and escalate concerns to a medical colleague of appropriate seniority. Make early referral to psychiatric services of women with serious mental health problems in line with the advice inBack to basics . Ensure the availability and use of professional interpreting services for women who need them. Provide continuity of care for vulnerable women to promote engagement with the service. Some key research questions also emerged during the assessment of the women who died this triennium. These are listed in the Recommendations section of this Report but include research on assessing, what effect, if any, is thereduced number of routine postnatal visits and clinical observations having on maternal health. Introduction This chapter identies and highlights the key practice issuesfor midwives raised by review of the circumstances and careof the 261 women who died either of Direct orIndirect causes of maternal death. There were many instances ofexemplary care but also others where lessons can be learned.It is the aim of this Chapter to highlight both. Midwives should read this Chapter in the context of the Report as a whole and with particular reference to the newsection Back to basics . The nature of the midwife's role, as described below, means that midwifery care cannot be sep-arated from the care provided by other members of thematernity team. Many of the key issues raised in thisReport relate to effective team-working or multidisciplinary care, as well as issues of clinical importance, so there is much to be learnt from these other Chapters. The role of the midwife Every pregnant woman has care provided by a midwife.This places the midwife rmly by her side, as her compan-ion throughout the childbearing continuum and the pro-vider of care, advice, support and information appropriate to her circumstances. The midwife is also her advocate in ensuring that she receives the care best suited to meetingher health and social needs. It was evident from some of thesituations reviewed for this Report that midwives need todevelop clear boundaries between advocacy and collusion.There were instances where midwives should have taken aChapter 13: Midwifery \u00aa2011 Centre 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 149supportive but challenging approach to ensure that women received appropriate care that was in the best interests ofthemselves and their babies. As examples: A woman with a raised Body Mass Index (BMI) declined to be weighed and, although she was booked for consultant-led care, did not attend the appointments to see her obste-trician. There was no evidence that her midwife hadexplained the risks of her raised BMI or provided furtheradvice, information or support. She did not have thrombo- prophylactic measures prescribed following a complicated delivery requiring a caesarean section, and basic postnatalobservations were missed . Although the deciencies in her midwifery care cannot be directly linked to her death from pulmonary embolism,there is nevertheless no evidence that midwives addressedthe issue appropriately at the beginning of pregnancy, insuch a way that could have enabled a management plan tobe put into place. A high-risk woman with learning disabilities and very high levels of anxiety developed symptoms of pre-eclampsia, inspite of which she continued to be inappropriately managedin the community. Following the birth, she left hospitalagainst medical advice and, during the postnatal period,became increasingly unwell. She died from disseminating intravascular coagulation some days after birth . Although her midwifery care was kind and supportive, the midwives' acceptance of her anxiety appeared to influ- ence their decision to offer midwife-led care, which for this woman was not appropriate. An alternative approach toher care would have been to work with her to help herovercome her anxieties, involving support from psychologyand/or learning disability services. This could have enabledthe woman to access the care she needed. As illustrated by the vignettes above, the role of the mid- wife is to become the woman's 'care navigator' 1working within the context of the maternity team and other agen- cies, providing both the continuity and the communicationlinks that will protect and ensure the mother's health andwellbeing. Similar lessons can be learned from some of the25Indirect deaths where the women were booked for mid- wife-led care. Some of these women who died had co-mor-bidities that were either missed by the midwife or deemedto be unimportant. The public-health role of the midwife Midwives have the opportunity to make a substantial con-tribution to the public-health agenda and to maximisinghealth gain and reducing general health inequalities. Theopening Chapter of this Report highlights yet again thatthe most vulnerable mothers in society are at far higherrisk of maternal death, and it is imperative that they can readily access maternity care which should, where possible,be a positive experience. Women disadvantaged by socialdeprivation, unemployment and minority ethnic status, forexample, are doubly disadvantaged by the fact that they tend to book later for antenatal care. For some of the women who died, earlier access to care could have made adifference. The National Institute for Health and ClinicalExcellence (NICE) have recently issued a guideline on theorganisation of services for women with complex socialissues that may affect their pregnancy 2as a result of recommendations made in several earlier Reports of thisEnquiry. Chapter 1 highlights the key issue of obesity, a major risk factor for maternal deaths and disability; helping andsupporting obese pregnant women requires urgent and co-ordinated action. A systematic and pro-active approach toaddressing the problems associated with raised BMI is akey priority for maternity services, and midwives are cen-tral to implementing these approaches. Learning from the mothers who died: issues for midwifery practice Learning from substandard care One of the main aims of this Enquiry is to learn lessons from the management of the women who died toimprove care in future. The rst step in doing this is toidentify any avoidable and substandard factors in the care they received. This is done by both regional and central Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries midwifery asses-sors. The detailed process is discussed in Appendix 1 ofthis Report. At each stage, the case notes are reviewed bymidwives who specically focus on the appropriateness ofthe midwifery care throughout the continuum of care.The factors identied by the assessors clearly demonstratethat, in a small number of women, midwifery care was not provided within the midwife's contractual or statutory requirements and has fallen outside the sphere of safepractice. It is also worth noting that some of the internalreviews considered for this Report demonstrated a failureby midwives to recognise that care had been substandard. During this triennium, a total of 261 women died from Direct orIndirect causes. In 31 of the 107 Direct deaths (29%), the midwifery assessors considered midwifery care to be substandard, as well as in 27 of the 154 (16%) Indi- rect deaths. This gives a rate of 22% overall for the 261 women who died of Direct and Indirect causes and whose deaths comprise the numerator for the reported maternalmortality rate. In a further seven women who wereexcluded from the statistics because their deaths wereeither unrelated to pregnancy or happened late in thepostnatal year, care was also less than optimal. IssuesGarrod et al. 150 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203relating to substandard care can be broadly grouped into poor midwifery care, failure to ensure appropriate seniorpresence and input to care and failure to recognise, andact on, high risk. In a majority of women, more than oneof these factors was present. Poor general midwifery care The poor care identied by the midwifery assessors was theresult of a number and combination of factors including: poor communication inadequate documentation failure to perform observations failure to follow up observations or to follow up the woman reporting feeling unwell failure to visit or re-visit during the postnatal period. Some high-risk women were not being correctly identi- ed and managed in their antenatal period: there wereexamples of delays in performing and acting on ndingssuch as proteinuria. In a case in the postnatal period, acommunity midwife noted that a woman was experiencingrigors; however, she failed to record the woman's tempera- ture and respiratory rate and to palpate the uterus, although she did arrange a GP appointment. Failure to ensure appropriate senior presence and input to care In 20 women there was a failure to ensure an appropriate senior presence or referral. This was either a failure to referto specialist or obstetric care during the pregnancy or a fail- ure to escalate concerns to a senior person, either medical or senior midwifery staff, when ominous signs of illnesswere evident. In addition to these, there were 11 women forwhom there was a failure by midwives to recognise and acton obvious risk. For example, a delay in getting an urgentappointment with a neurologist should not have just beennoted, it should also have been followed up. Similarly,where a woman failed to attend for such specialist care, fur- ther advice should have been sought. Failure to recognise, and act on, high risk There were several examples of midwives failing to act appropriately on warning signs/risk factors: A woman in the postnatal period saw a midwife for a postnatal examination and reported having felt unwell fora week with symptoms of breathlessness and pain onbreathing; she also had swelling in one leg and calf andthigh pain. She was advised by the midwife to attend hos-pital or a walk-in centre. Some hours later she arrived atthe Emergency Department where she collapsed, was intu- bated, ventilated and transferred to the Intensive-Care Unit. A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism/deep veinthrombosis was made. She went on to have several cardiacarrests later that day. She continued to deteriorate and died some days later . The midwife who saw this woman failed to recognise the potential severity of her symptoms: she should have takenurgent action to expedite her transfer to hospital via ambu-lance. The fact that there was a delay of several hoursbefore she went to hospital could have made a differenceto the outcome. Holistic care The Encarta English Dictionary3denes 'holistic' as 'taking into account all of somebody's physical, mental, and socialconditions in the treatment of illness'. Within the Enquiry, there were instances where midwives did not provide such care; for example, situations in whichphysical illness was attributed to a past history of mentalhealth problems: A woman with a history of chronic physical illness and panic attacks died as the result of a severe and undiagnosedinfection. Her symptoms and behaviour were attributed to her past history of mental health issues, and, by the time investigations were made and treatment was commenced, itwas too late. The key message is that midwives must listen to women and use their knowledge and clinical skills to identify and meet all needs. This woman had repeatedly told the mid-wives both in hospital and at home that she felt very illand was in considerable pain, but her concerns about phys-ical symptoms were not heard or acted on. When a womanvoices concern about abnormal symptoms, basic observa-tions must be taken, documented and, if abnormal, actedon by appropriate referral. There was also evidence of the converse. The care for a woman whose death was associated with epilepsy placedgreat emphasis on meeting her social and psychological,but not clinical, needs. This meant that the midwifeneglected to ensure that she had appropriate care in placeto address the risk factors associated with her epilepsy. Good midwifery practice: over-arching themes The over-arching themes for midwifery practice, based on the stories of the women who died over the past 3 years,are as follows: Provision of 'basic' midwifery care: the fundamentals of practice Team work: referral pathways, communication, and clear care planning Recognition of risk factors and serious illness and act- ing on theseChapter 13: Midwifery 1), 1-203 151Culture and systems within organisations, and new patterns of care Public health issues These ve over-arching themes are explored within the framework of the different 'phases' of the childbearing con- tinuum: antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care. In its guidance the Nursing and Midwifery Coun-cil 4highlights that: Childbirth is more than the act of giving birth. For a woman it is a continuous process from conception, through pregnancy, labour, birth and beyond. It is essen-tial that anyone providing midwifery care during thistime has the appropriate skills, knowledge and compe-tence to do so. 4 Antenatal care Antenatal booking The importance of the antenatal booking interview cannotbe overemphasised. It is at this point that midwives play a key role in ensuring an appropriate pattern of care is agreed with the woman and communicated clearly to her,making referral to other services and agencies for care andsupport. Poor risk assessment and inappropriate referralpathways for care can and do increase poor outcomes, bothmortality and morbidity. Key issues identied are: When women present for care, they must be seen promptly. There were multiple examples of long delays between women seeing their GP at 6 weeks and then having no contact with a midwife until 12 weeks orlater. Balancing the woman's physical, social, psychological, emotional and spiritual needs enables the midwife totake into account the woman's life circumstances,which may impact on her pregnancy. For example,there were instances of women experiencing signicant bereavement (loss of partners by suicide) and loss (removal of previous children into the care of theLocal Authority), which should have been acknowl-edged and appropriate support offered. As highlighted in Chapter 11, women must be asked about previous history of psychiatric disorder as wellas their current mental health. Women with a historyof a serious mental illness should be referred for psy- chiatric assessment and for a management plan to be developed for the management of any acute postnatalepisode even if they are currently well. The question of domestic abuse should be raised at booking or soon afterwards if the midwife is unable tospeak to the woman alone at booking. This issue isdiscussed in Chapter 12.The denition of risk at booking and the ongoing review of risk status are key in ensuring safe andappropriate care. This includes the need to calculatean accurate BMI at booking, which is of crucialimportance: midwives must not rely on mothers self- reporting their weight or guessing their height. The current organisation of maternity care means that in many areas women do not see their GP for antena-tal care. Good communication systems between mid-wife and GP are essential to ensure that information isappropriately shared. Women should be advised totake their hand-held records to GP appointments,regardless of the reason for the consultation. Lack of interpreters Failure in the provision of professional interpreting servicesemerges as a signicant theme, which recurs throughout allof the chapters of this Report. It should be highlighted herethat there were too many examples of inappropriate use offamily members to interpret. Consequently, in these cases,the midwife was unable to obtain a comprehensive booking history, and some women were denied access to support for domestic abuse. A further issue in relation to languagebarriers was identied for those women who arrived in theUK from abroad later in pregnancy: without interpretingservices, it was impossible to obtain a full booking historyand make an assessment of risk factors. Ongoing antenatal care The importance of performing basic observations, record-ing these and acting on the ndings is a key message formidwives to take from this Report. In particular, there werenumerous instances of midwives failing to perform urinaly-sis, sometimes with potentially disastrous consequences. Ofequal importance is the responsibility to make appropriatereferral when a deviation from the norm is detected. Therewere examples of women with abnormal ndings during an antenatal examination (for example raised blood pres- sure and glycosuria) being advised to see a practice nursefor re-assessment. This is entirely inappropriate, as it isoutside the scope of their practice. The provision of written information is crucial. When a potential or actual problem is detected, clear written infor-mation in the woman's rst language is of vital importanceto enable her to seek further help if 'warning signs' of a worsening condition develop. The provision of this infor- mation, in addition to verbal advice, should be docu-mented. A woman who booked late for antenatal care had symp- toms of pre-eclampsia identied at a community antenatal appointment in the third trimester. She was referred to theobstetric unit the following day, reviewed and communityGarrod et al. 152 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203midwife follow up was arranged. This did not take place as planned, and some days later she self-referred to the hospi-tal, arriving with a blood pressure of 215/115 mmHg. Herblood pressure proved impossible to control; she had anemergency caesarean section and died within a week as a result of a brain haemorrhage. There was no evidence that she had been given written information about the signs ofpre-eclampsia. As highlighted in Chapter 2, women are at risk of thromboembolism from the very beginning of pregnancy until the end of the puerperium. Midwives must be awareof this risk, carry out risk assessments, and act on them. When obstetric input is indicated, midwives have a responsibility to ensure that this input is at the correct levelof seniority. For example, a pregnant woman admitted tohospital with complications and the potential for seriousillness requires early assessment by a senior obstetrician. In at least one organisation where women died, the admission policy was for all women to be reviewed by a senior houseofcer before a registrar or above was called. This isentirely inappropriate. Women who have long-term co-existing medical condi- tions need appropriate and consistent advice on managingthese: for example, women with epilepsy should beadvised against bathing or bathing their baby unattended; women with asthma should continue with their medica- tion if required. Midwives are advised to read Chapter 10which considers issues relating to 'Other Indirect deaths.' Women who do not attend antenatal appointments are at risk of developing complications that go undetected untiltheir condition becomes serious or life-threatening. Thesewomen are also more likely to be socially vulnerable, inpoorer physical health and to have mental health problems, as outlined in Chapter 1. All these factors increase their vulnerability. There are many examples of midwives goingto great lengths to support these women and to providecare tailored to meet their complex needs. For example: A grand multiparous woman had a long history of drug and alcohol abuse and chaotic lifestyle. She booked early inher pregnancy and had appropriate referral to all relevantagencies and services, some of which she accessed. She hadregular antenatal care, facilitated by the midwife's efforts tofollow up when she did not attend. Despite this, she died ofa drug overdose. Her midwife should be commended for her recognition of this woman's extreme vulnerability and her perseverancein providing her with appropriate care. However, alongsidethe positive examples of good practice such as this, there were also instances where there was a lack of robust sys- tems to follow up women who failed to attend for care.The failure to record this, and so enable follow up, furtherincreased the likelihood of these women suffering severe pregnancy-related complications or death. Where there are safeguarding issues and social care involvement, the decision may be taken to remove a babyat birth to the care of the Local Authority. The period of time 'pre and post case conference' should be recognised as one of high vulnerability for women where vigilance isvital. Support should be embedded into the system; multi-agency liaison is essential to address the woman's needs.However, a midwife whom the woman knows and trustshas a particular role to play in providing ongoing support,and a follow-up visit or appointment should be plannedfollowing the case conference decision. Intrapartum care The basics: communicating with women Listening carefully to women and assessing their physicaland emotional needs is a fundamental part of good mid-wifery care. Good communication involves giving clearexplanations and checking that the woman has understood, as well as listening. There were several examples in which there was no evidence of women having been involved indecisions that set in motion the chain of events that led totheir deaths. These include decisions to induce labour withno clear indication. For example: A multiparous woman was induced with prostaglandins for 'post maturity'. Her rst labour had been short, and thistime labour lasted for less than an hour. Following a nor-mal delivery, she was transferred to the postnatal wardwhere she collapsed and died a few hours after the birth ofa massive haemorrhage. In this case, there was no clear rationale given for the induction of labour and no evidence that the risks andbenets of induction had been discussed with the mother. Women of minority ethnic groups who have no or poor use of English are particularly vulnerable during labour. As in the antenatal period, the use of family members fortranslation is not appropriate. Commissioners and provid-ers of maternity services must ensure the 24-hour availabil-ity of language support services to reduce women'svulnerability at this time. There were several exampleswhere the use of an interpreter would have greatly assistedthe mother during labour. For example: A non-English-speaking woman planned a vaginal birth following a previous caesarean section. Although she rstpresented to her GP at 12 weeks, she failed to attend forbooking until her third trimester. At this stage, the mid- wife she saw was unable to undertake her booking because of pressure of work so this was carried out some weekslater. At term she had an assisted delivery for delay inChapter 13: Midwifery \u00aa2011 Centre 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 153the second stage and suspected fetal compromise. She col- lapsed and died of a haemorrhage some hours later. Theonly mention of an interpreter was when the woman wasin extremis and the staff wished to explain events to herhusband. Basic observations and assessment There were many examples of failure to make or actupon basic observations. For instance, a woman with sev- eral risk factors for pre-eclampsia arrived at hospital with a fully dilated cervix and promptly gave birth. She wasgiven Syntometrine and, over the next few hours, wasobserved to have at least four abnormal features symp-tomatic of pre-eclampsia. These were not acted uponuntil she suffered a cerebral haemorrhage as a result anddied. Appropriate risk assessment must be performed for all women and risk status reviewed as necessary. For example: A morbidly obese woman with additional risk factors for hypertension had neither obstetric nor anaesthetic review in either pregnancy or labour and so had no plan for delivery care. She was induced at term, having had prelabourrupture of membranes; the syntocinon rate was increased,on the instruction of the senior midwife, when the cardioto-cograph was already pathological. An emergency caesareansection was carried out for suspected fetal compromise, andthis was followed by a fatal postpartum haemorrhage. Another woman had a retained placenta following a nor- mal delivery. There seemed to be no appreciation of thechange in her risk status, which led to failure to performappropriate observations and monitoring. It was severalhours before she was transferred to theatre. She suffered amassive haemorrhage and underwent a hysterectomy butdied. In these, and other cases, there seemed to be no recognition that a further risk assessment needed to bemade in the light of an unforeseen complication andthat delay in responding might exacerbate the woman'scondition. Recognition of risk factors/signs of serious illness and team working Women with risk factors need clear multidisciplinary care plans for labour and birth. On occasion, midwives' failureto call for senior medical help illustrated that this is associ-ated with a lack of recognition of the seriousness of thecondition or with an inadequate response, including poor or no planning. For example: A woman with severe pre-eclampsia was admitted to the labour ward by an Senior House Ofcer but was not seenby a registrar for some hours. Treatment eventually com- menced but was inadequate, and by the time a consultantwas involved (several hours after admission), the womanhad sustained an intracerebral haemorrhage. She died thefollowing day. The midwife should have escalated this woman's referral to the consultant obstetrician. Stafng and Supervision For some women, documentation in case notes indicatedthat the unit was very busy. However, it was apparent inalmost every case that escalation policies were not activatedappropriately, including involvement of the Supervisor ofMidwives. 4There were, however, some examples of exem- plary practice: A woman expecting her rst baby was an inpatient at term; she collapsed and required resuscitation, during which anemergency caesarean was undertaken. Despite excellent care,she did not survive. The clinicians involved in this event responded in a prompt, efcient and energetic manner, and excellentteamwork was evident. The standard of the statement writ-ing is such that a clear audit trail can be seen. In particular,there was thorough support from the Supervisor of Mid- wives, who was present for the emergency and also arranged extensive support for the midwives during thedays and weeks following. Postnatal care Midwives should be aware that the postnatal period ispotentially a time of higher risk than pregnancy or labour. As shown in Chapter 1, 63% of the 261 women who died from Direct and Indirect causes did so following the birth of their babies. There is a concern that the growing reduc-tion in the frequency of direct postnatal visits and the driveto replace direct contact with telephone communicationmay be leading to less than optimal care. This is a researchrecommendation in this Report. Getting the basics right Assessment of the woman's health and wellbeing willreduce the risk of the midwife focusing on emotional/men-tal health issues that may be masking signs of physical ill-ness. Having made an overall assessment of wellbeing, themidwife should ensure that basic observations are per-formed and recorded, acting on abnormal ndings. Therewere examples in the report of midwives failing in these basic responsibilities, following both normal and operative deliveries.Garrod et al. 154 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203Beware sepsis It is of crucial importance for midwives to recognise that this Report identies sepsis as the leading cause of Direct mortality and to act on the 'take home messages' fromChapter 7. Despite the increase noted in this Report, sep- sis remains a rare event, and addressing issues relating to sepsis is a challenge for midwives and for mothers. Thereis an urgent need for an awareness campaign for staff andparents, backed up by clear written information on thewarning signs and symptoms for parents with instructionson what to do if they are concerned. Midwives must beaware of the potential sites of infection, including the gen-ital tract and the breast, and also that women with other infections (for example, a sore throat) are potentially at risk of the infection becoming systemic. Carrying out basic care and observations is of essential importance, as is acting promptly on abnormal ndings. Asa result of these repeated ndings, a new section has beenadded to this Report, Back to basics , which should be read and acted on by all maternity staff. As an example of wherethis might have made a difference: A healthy young woman with a history of normal births had a straightforward labour and birth at term. She wasdischarged from hospital the following day and received postnatal visits from her midwife. Within the rst week, on two occasions her midwife recorded that she was pyrexialand feeling unwell; she advised the woman to see her GP ifshe continued to feel ill. The midwife visited again 2 dayslater but did not make any basic observations. The follow-ing day, the woman saw her GP, who referred her immedi-ately to hospital where she was admitted with abdominalpain and septic shock. Her condition worsened rapidly, and, despite excellent inpatient care, she suffered complete organ failure and died shortly afterwards.As illustrated above, a previously healthy woman can unexpectedly become seriously ill and die extremelyquickly. The midwife did not follow up her abnormal nd-ings with a telephone call or visit the next day. When shedid visit again, she failed to make basic observations. Mid- wives must recognise signs of infection which are discussed in detail in both the new Back to basics section of this Report and in Chapter 7, which are summarised in thelearning points Box 13.1. To reduce the risks of infection during the postnatal per- iod, midwives and others should: Take a full history from a woman who has pyrexia and feels unwell. Check if she or a family member had a sore throat. A 'strep A throat' can rapidly become a generalised streptococcus A infection. Midwives shouldbe aware of the potential for 'mouth to genital tracttransmission' and, for example, advise all women,including those who have, or whose close contactshave, a sore throat to adopt simple hygiene measuressuch as washing her hands before as well as after usingthe lavatory and changing her sanitary pads. Women should be given written information about what to expect in the postnatal period, together withwhat to look out for in terms of developing problems.This should include symptoms of infection, of pre-eclampsia and pulmonary embolism/deep vein throm-bosis. This information must also make clear who tocontact for help and advice on a 24-hour basis. Air embolism In most of the previous Reports of this Enquiry, as wellas in this one, a few deaths of women from air embolismfollowing sexual intercourse in the postnatal period havebeen reported. It is hypothesised that this is the result ofair being forced into the mother's circulatory system Box 13.1. Signs and symptoms of sepsis Pyrexia is common, but a normal temperature does not exclude sepsis. Paracetamol and other analgesics may mask pyrexia, and this should be taken into account when assessing women who are unwell. Hypothermia is a signicant nding that may indicate severe infection and should not be ignored. Swinging pyrexia and failure to respond to broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics is suggestive of a persistent focus of infection or abscess. Persistent tachycardia >100 beats/minute is an important sign that may indicate serious underlying disease and should be fully investigated. Tachypnoea is sepsis until proved otherwise - persistently increased respiratory rate >20 breaths/minute is a signicant clinical nding that can a lso indicate other serious pathology, such as pulmonary oedema, pneumonia, thromboembolism or amniotic fluid embolism, and impending cardiac arrest. Neutropenia \u00b7109white blood cells per litre is a signicant nding that may indicate severe infection. Diarrhoea is a common and important symptom of pelvic sepsis. Diarrhoea and/or vomiting in a woman with any evidence of sepsis is a very serious sign and an indication for commencing immediate broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy. Severe lower abdominal pain and severe 'after-pains' that require frequent analgesia or do not respond to usual analgesia are also common important symptoms of pelvic sepsis. In some women, very severe lower abdominal pain may be the result of the action of bacterial toxins on the bowel wall. On rare occasions, overwhelming streptococcal infection can present with generalised abdominal pain in the absence of pyrexia and tachycardia. Abnormal or absent fetal heart with or without placental abruption may be the result of sepsis.Chapter 13: 1), 1-203 155through therefore rec- ommended that: Midwives' discussion of contraception and sexual health issues after delivery should include clear adviceabout sexual intercourse. The medical assessors to this Enquiry recommend abstinence for 6 weeks, or gentle intercourse and avoidance of positions where excessair could be forced into the vagina. Team work and care planning Low-risk women who are planning early discharge fromhospital or who have given birth at home need a thoroughand thoughtful rst postnatal assessment, with awareness that serious complications can develop rapidly in the early postnatal period. Midwives should be aware that common problems in the postnatal period can occasionally become life threatening.There is no room for complacency. High-risk women need clear discharge planning with appropriate senior obstetric input. Women who have hadproblem-free pregnancies and births but who develop post- natal complications should have senior obstetric review and discharge care planning before going home. It is essential to plan ongoing care and support for the most vulnerable women, with documented pathways estab-lished for transfer of care to the health visitor. For exam-ple: A woman with an unplanned rst pregnancy booked late for care. No assessment of her mental health was made atbooking or during the pregnancy. She had an emergencycaesarean section and expressed feelings of disappointmentand failure. She struggled with breastfeeding, and this com-pounded her feelings of inadequacy. Although the midwife recorded the woman's emotional distress, she did not communicate this to the GP or thehealth visitor. There was no co-ordinated plan recorded for her ongoing care and support. This woman committed sui- cide some weeks after birth. As highlighted in the previous section on antenatal care, women with mental health problems and those whosebabies have been removed into the care of the LocalAuthority for safeguarding reasons may be particularly vul-nerable and must be offered ongoing support. Organisational issues Organisational issues relating to postnatal care are of para-mount importance, in particular full and timely communi-cation of information and ensuring that there are clearpathways for cross-boundary hand-over. New patterns of postnatal care, for example the reduc- tion in the number of routine home visits, additional clin-ics/'drop-in' sessions in Children's Centres, and the use ofMidwifery Support Workers or other staff must have the same rigorous follow up and recording systems for womanwho did not attend as should be in place for the antenatalperiod. Failure to ensure such systems in place can meanthat women 'slip through the net': for example, a woman did not attend her Children's Centre postnatal appoint- ment and was subsequently not seen for a signicant per-iod, during which time she had become seriously ill anddied as a result. Timely intervention from a midwife whenshe became symptomatic might have saved her life. Overall summary: take home messages Quality of internal reviews A woman dying is fortunately a rare event within any sin- gle organisation. It merits a thorough multidisciplinaryreview, conducted in a spirit of open enquiry, to learn anylessons that may help to save mothers' lives in the future.There was evidence of some thorough and excellentreviews being carried out by Trusts; however, the converse is also true. Given the rarity of the event, it was surprising that some reviews were so cursory; others did not haveinput from senior midwives into round-table discussions.All such reviews must include input from the Head ofMidwifery and Supervisors of Midwives. If the arrange-ments within individual Trusts do not support this, thenadvice must be sought from the Local Supervisory Author-ity. 5 Supervision of midwives Midwifery supervision has a central role to play in enablingevery midwife to reflect on her professional practice and tolearn from those situations where care has been wellplanned and delivered as well as those where there havebeen adverse outcomes. Supervision is therefore a key toolin implementing the lessons learned from this Report. 5 Final reflections As described at the beginning of this Chapter, midwives inthe UK are in a unique position in relation to childbearingwomen and their families, both in terms of their statutoryresponsibilities and their ongoing relationship with women.They are the healthcare professionals who can take the overview of the woman's health and wellbeing throughout the childbearing continuum. It is imperative that the oper-ational management of maternity services, as well as indi-vidual midwives, recognise that ensuring continuity of careand carer wherever possible plays a vital role in protectingthe wellbeing of women and their babies. Midwives are the experts in the care of healthy, low-risk women. They have a clear duty, however, to be equallyGarrod et al. 156 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203skilled in the recognition of early signs of problems and to make prompt referral for appropriate senior medical input. Midwives accompany women at all stages of the journey through pregnancy, birth and into new parenthood. Theongoing nature of this relationship between midwives and women means that midwives have a clear role as advo- cates for women, particularly those vulnerable womenmost in need of holistic support. However, at times, amidwife may be the woman's best advocate by challengingher and helping her to see that the course of action she issuggesting, although not the woman's choice, is in herbest interest. If there is a single 'take-home' message formidwives it is this: listen to the woman and act on what she tells you. Disclosure of interests None.

General practice (GP): specic recommendations All GPs should make themselves aware of the following guidelines: Venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolus GPs should know the risk factors and warning signs of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and pulmonary embolus(PE) in pregnancy and the puerperium. 1Risk factors include a past history of embolism, obesity or hyperemesis, and warning signs include breathlessness. Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia GPs need to ensure that they are up to date with guidelines for the detection and the referral indications for pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. 2This should be actively excluded in women presenting with epigastric pain in pregnancy. Asthma GP care should be consistent with recent guidelines.3Steroids and beta-agonists are safe in pregnancy. Mental health GPs are the lynch pin for multidisciplinary communication with the local perinatal mental health and general mental health services and should follow the perinatal mental health guideline produced by the National Institute for Healthand Clinical Excellence (NICE). 4 Obesity There are recent guidelines about the management of obesity in pregnancy, and all GPs should be aware of them.5 Information sharing: specic recommendations Whenever possible, a GP should give a named community midwife condential access to the woman's full written and electronic records, with the woman's consent. If thisis not possible, the GP should supply a named commu-nity midwife with a summary of the women's past medi-cal history, with the woman's consent. Introduction This chapter identies and highlights the key issues forGPs raised by the 64 cases of maternal death that wereassessed for this chapter in this triennium. It should be read in the context of the whole Report, especially the 'Top ten' recommendations and the Back to basics sections. In this chapter, the key clinical issues are addressed in the same order as the chapters in the Report, with someadditional GP-specic issues. The cases examined had sig-nicant involvement of a GP in the care of the womenwho died, or they were representative of a number of simi-lar cases. For many women, the GP care was exemplary, but, by the very nature of this Report, there were some where the care was less than optimal. An assessment ofwhether the care was substandard was a judgement madein the light of the prevailing standards for good care at thetime of the death as described in Good Medical Practice for GPs. 6In 45 of these 64 women, GP care was assessed asShakespeare 158 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203substandard; in 37 women this was judged to be a major factor, meaning that better care may have changed theeventual outcome. In the other eight women it was judgedto be a minor factor, meaning that although lessons couldbe learned, the care probably did not affect the eventual outcome. A signicant cross-cutting and recurrent theme is obes- ity. Obesity in pregnancy is an increasing problem and isassociated with adverse pregnancy outcomes for thewoman. Its prevalence and outcomes are discussed in moredetail in Chapter 1. There are recent guidelines about themanagement of obesity in pregnancy. 5 Clinical causes of death Venous thromboembolism Two of the seven women assessed for this section had sub-standard GP care. For example, the following case of deepvein thrombosis (DVT) with a subsequent PE was missedby two GPs: An obese woman with recognised needle phobia refused all blood tests in pregnancy and declined enoxaparin (Clex-ane) after a caesarean section. She discussed this with amidwife, who gave her TED stockings and told her tomove her legs, but there was no discussion with a doctor and no record of her refusal of thromboprophylaxis in the discharge letter. She saw her GP some days later withswollen legs but no pain, and her GP stated 'not a DVT'.Another GP reviewed her a few days later and prescribedanalgesics for severe leg pain. Some days later she diedfrom a PE. This woman had several risk factors for a DVT: a recent pregnancy, operative delivery and signicant obesity. DVTscannot be excluded by looking at the legs. The second GPshould also have recognised the classic signs and symp-toms. Her needle phobia could have been treated by psy- chological help during pregnancy. It was mentioned in the GP referral letter, but no action was taken. There shouldalso have been a discussion in pregnancy about her risk ofVTE, the importance of possible prophylaxis after deliveryand clear documentation in the hospital discharge letterabout her refusal of prophylaxis. Breathlessness is a common symptom in pregnancy, but it can be a symptom of PE, and premonitory symptoms sometimes occur: A woman with no known risk factors died in her third trimester from a massive PE having seen her GP a fewdays earlier complaining of shortness of breath. She had a careful examination, including a peak flow and oximetry, but her pulse was not recorded. A diagnosis of asthmawas made, and she was treated with a salbutamol inhaler. A signicant event analysis was completed in the prac- tice and returned to the Enquiry. The practice reflectedon the importance of observing the pulse rate and theopportunity for the GP involved to be supported by col-leagues. Three other women who died of PE had also presented to their GP with breathlessness shortly before their death. It can be difcult to distinguish signicant causes from trivial ones, and this is discussed in more detail in the Back to basics section of this Report. The inclusion of the signi- cant event analysis report was unique, and the GP practiceis to be commended for this. Hyperemesis and PE Hyperemesis is a recognised risk factor for VTE, and two cases of PE associated with severe hyperemesis gravidarum were assessed. These women had been treated with antie-metics but had not been monitored for dehydration. Earlieradmission for rehydration and thromboprophylaxis mighthave prevented their deaths. VTE: learning points Making, or excluding, a diagnosis of DVT requireshospital-based investigations. Shortness of breath may be the result of a PE, espe-cially if a woman has risk factors. Women with severe hyperemesis are at higher risk ofVTE; they require close monitoring for dehydrationand should be admitted to hospital if they fail to respond adequately to antiemetics. Needle phobic women can benet from psychological treatment during pregnancy to avoid compromisingtheir obstetric or emergency care. Eclampsia The cases of several of the 19 mothers who died fromeclampsia were reviewed for this chapter, although they arecounted and discussed in Chapter 3. In all cases, the GPcare was substandard. The main failings were a failure toundertake routine observations of blood pressure and pro-teinuria and a failure to understand the signicance of, andact on, signicant abnormalities. For example: A healthy primiparous woman developed proteinuria +++ in her third trimester, but her GP recorded a normal bloodpressure. She was referred urgently to a urology clinic. Afew weeks later she was admitted by a midwife with epigas- tric pain, irritability and reduced fetal movements with a blood pressure of >200/110 mmHg. She required anChapter 14: General practice (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 159emergency caesarean section after becoming confused and drowsy. She died the next day from a cerebralhaemorrhage. Her GP had failed to recognise the signicance of new onset proteinuria in pregnancy, and she should have beenurgently referred to the obstetric services, not urology. In a further case a GP started treatment for pre-eclamp- sia without hospital referral: A woman with hypertension appropriately stopped her enalapril at the start of pregnancy, but the midwifebooked for low-risk care, although the GP had mentionedher hypertension in the referral letter. In the second trimester, her blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg, and her GP started methyldopa; her urine was not checked forprotein until some days later, when proteinuria was pres-ent. A few days later she was admitted with epigastricpain, catastrophic hypertension and heavy proteinuria. Shedied of multi-organ failure and HELLP (haemolysis, ele-vated liver enzymes and low platelet count) syndrome. GPs should never start treatment for hypertension in pri- mary care without specialist support. If this woman hadbeen referred immediately when her blood pressure wasraised, she would probably have survived. The communitymanagement of hypertension in pregnancy has been addressed in guidelines, and GPs should be aware of these. 7 HELLP syndrome is part of the spectrum of pre-eclampsia: A woman who developed gestational diabetes during preg- nancy was under the care of the diabetic antenatal unit (DAU). In her third trimester, she complained aboutreduced fetal movements, generalised itching, oedema andhaematemesis. The DAU failed to recognise the signicanceof these symptoms and recommended that she see her GP.By now she also complained of smelly faeces, tiredness, slug-gish fetal movements and belching. Her GP recorded thatshe was jaundiced, with abdominal pain and bilateral leg oedema; her blood pressure was normal. The GP performed no investigations but advised her to see the midwife thenext day. By the next morning she was severely ill, withhypertension, proteinuria +++ and deep jaundice. Despiteimmediate delivery, she developed disseminated intravascu-lar coagulation and died. At autopsy, the diagnosis wasHELLP syndrome. HELLP syndrome may present before the other symp- toms of pre-eclampsia. It has a poor prognosis andrequires immediate delivery to prevent rapid deteriorationof maternal liver function. Her specialist care was sub-standard in failing to recognise the early symptoms of HELLP syndrome. However, her GP should also have recognised that severe jaundice in late pregnancy was sig-nicant, even if she/he did not recognise HELLP syn-drome, and should have referred her to hospital immediately. This GP had no other contact with thiswoman during pregnancy, was no longer carrying out anyroutine antenatal care and was unaware of the serious sig-nicance of her symptoms. Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia: learning points Epigastric pain is a common symptom of signicant pre-eclampsia. Routine observation of urine and blood pressure should be checked every time a pregnant woman is seen by a GP, especially if she is feeling unwell. Jaundice in a pregnant woman requires immediateinvestigation and admission. GPs should always refer a woman with pre-eclampsiafor specialist care and should only start antihyperten-sives in primary care if a woman is severely unwell,before her emergency admission; in this situation the treatment of choice is oral labetolol. Bleeding or abdominal pain in pregnancy Deaths in early pregnancy are counted and discussed in Chapter 6. Unlike earlier reports, misdiagnosed womenwho died from ectopic pregnancies were uncommon, but they continue to occur: A woman, unaware of her pregnancy, developed diarrhoea and vomiting and spoke to an out-of-hours GP. A provi- sional diagnosis of gastroenteritis was made. Her own GP visited the next morning and admitted her to hospitalunder the physicians, where the junior doctors continued totreat her for gastroenteritis until she was in extremis. Atautopsy, a ruptured ectopic pregnancy was found. The GP care was appropriate, but the diagnosis of a pos- sible ectopic pregnancy was not considered either by theGP or the hospital doctors. This presentation with diar-rhoea and vomiting and abdominal pain but withoutbleeding is typical of cases reported in the last few Reports.If an ectopic had been considered, the outcome may havebeen different. A higher level of suspicion and pregnancy testing could make a difference. A woman who spoke no English died after a miscarriage: A woman went to see a practice nurse for a routine immunisation and took her young daughter as an inter- preter. The nurse elicited that her period was overdue anddeclined to give the immunisation. It appeared from laternotes that she had been bleeding vaginally for some timebefore this consultation. Later that night she collapsed. Atautopsy, there was evidence of chronic vaginal blood lossand severe anaemia from an incomplete miscarriage.Shakespeare 160 \u00aa2011 Centre Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203If the nurse had asked more questions about the preg- nancy, she may have discovered the history of bleeding.The use of relatives, especially young children, as interpret-ers is a recurring issue throughout this Report and is dis-cussed in more detail under the key recommendations in Chapter 1. GPs and practice staff need to know how to access translating services rapidly within their area. Pain and bleeding in early pregnancy: learning points GPs should ask all women of reproductive age with diarrhoea and vomiting and abdominal pain about the risk of pregnancy. If there is any doubt, theyshould carry out a pregnancy test in the surgery; theyshould consider carrying a pregnancy test in theiremergency bags. GPs and practice staff should know how to accessprofessional translation services rapidly. This is amajor recommendation in this Report. Sepsis Deaths from sepsis are discussed in detail in Chapter 7. Inthe last Report, the GP chapter warned that 'puerperal feveris not a disease of the past'. Deaths from genital tract sepsishave risen rather than declined in this triennium. Genital tract sepsis has become the leading cause of Direct maternal deaths in the UK for the rst time since these CondentialEnquiries into Maternal Deaths commenced in 1952. Manyof these deaths were from community-aquired Group Astreptococcal disease, mirroring an overall backgroundincrease in mortality from this disease in the general popula-tion. For many of these women, the outcome was unavoid-able despite excellent care because of the rapid course and late presentation of the illness. However, in others, pos- sible opportunities to save lives may have been missed andlessons remain to be learnt. Many women were in contactwith primary care, of which the following case is typical: A woman developed a temperature and tachycardia a few days after delivery, and her midwife suggested that she speakto her GP if she did not start to feel better, which she didnot do. The midwife saw her a few days later but did noroutine observations or examinations. The GP visited a dayor so later because of abdominal pain, by which time shewas very ill and breathless with signs of peripheral shut down. The GP made the correct diagnosis of puerperal sep- sis, spoke to the Emergency Department and faxed a letterbecause of his concern, but arranged a nonurgent ambulancetransfer. In hospital, she developed disseminated intravascu-lar coagulation and multiple organ failure, from which shesubsequently died. Blood culture was positive for group Ab-haemolytic streptococcus.Although her GP care was generally good, her hospital transfer should have been quicker. This was not the onlycase of septicaemia where a GP did not arrange emer-gency hospital transfer. The current management of sus-pected meningococcal septicaemia is to give parenteral penicillin before blue-light transfer. In puerperal sepsis, the group A b-haemolytic streptococcus is the usual pathogen and is sensitive to penicillin, so suspected casescould also be managed in the same way. The shockingspeed with which this illness progressed from earlysymptoms to death in a number of women cannot beoveremphasised. There were cases when septicaemia developed after a sore throat and upper respiratory tract infection. These women had all seen their GP or practice nurse about thesymptoms, and none had been prescribed antibiotics, incommon with routine practice. The GP care was good,but it may be that the threshold for taking a throat swaband treating with antibiotics should be lowered in preg-nancy. The Centor Criteria may be helpful in decidingwhich women are more likely to be suffering from Group A streptococcal infection. 8If any three of the fol- lowing criteria are positive, then antibiotic prescribing isindicated: history of fever tonsillar exudate no cough tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy There were two cases when women became septicaemic after mastitis. In such cases, an antibiotic should be com- menced immediately; oral flucloxacillin 500 mg four timesdaily for 10-14 days is the treatment of choice. 9The man- agement of sepsis is discussed in more detail in the Back to basics section of this Report. Sepsis: learning points All pregnant and recently delivered women should be informed about the risks and signs and symptoms ofinfection and how to take steps to prevent its trans-misson (see Back to basics section). All healthcare professionals should be aware of the classic signs and symptoms, and sepsis must be con-sidered in all recently delivered women who feel unwell and/or have pyrexia. Sepsis is often insidious in onset. In the community, vital signs should always be checked in women whohave any signs or symptoms of possible infection. Women with sepsis can deteriorate and die rapidly.Abdominal pain, fever and tachycardia are indicationsfor emergency admission by blue-light ambulance forintravenous antibiotics.Chapter 14: General (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 161Cardiac disease Deaths from cardiac conditions are discussed in more detail in Chapter 9. Ischaemic heart disease is becomingmore common in pregnancy because of later motherhood,less healthy lifestyles and obesity. However, even with clas-sic symptoms, two GPs failed to recognise the signicanceof this woman's pain: An older mother who smoked with a strong family history of heart disease developed pain in her left arm some weeksafter delivery. Her GP diagnosed muscular pain, but somedays later she woke with retrosternal chest pain radiating to her left arm and vomiting. The out-of-hours doctor recom- mended paracetamol. She died at home shortly afterwardsof a myocardial infarction Her GP and the out-of-hours GP both failed to consider the diagnosis, despite a classic history, and there was a fail-ure to make an adequate risk assessment because of inade-quate telephone triage. Other mothers with cardiac disease presented with chest pain and/or breathlessness. Signicant cardiac dis-ease needs to be distinguished from trivial breathlessnessand investigated urgently as an inpatient. This is dis- cussed in more detail in the Back to basics section of this Report. Cardiac disease: learning points Not all chest pain in pregnancy is heartburn: it maybe ischaemic, especially if a woman has risk factors. Breathlessness in pregnancy may be caused by cardiacconditions and needs to be carefully assessed. Epilepsy Deaths from neurological conditions are counted and dis-cussed in Chapter 10. Several deaths from epilepsy were reviewed for this Chapter, of whom three had substandard GP care. For example: A woman with well-controlled epilepsy had tailed off her sodium valproate before a planned pregnancy on the advice of a neurologist. When she had a t, her GP referred herback to neurology requesting an immediate appointment;this was given over a month later. The neurologist recom-mended starting lamotrigine and wrote to the GP but gaveno specic advice about how to introduce or monitor treat-ment. The woman did not see her GP following the neurol-ogy appointment. She was later found drowned in the bath. At post-mortem her lamotrigine level was <1 mg/l, suggest- ing that she had not taken the medication. Here the GP provided good care by referring her urgently to a neurologist. The neurologist should havecommunicated with the GP by fax or telephone and given explicit instructions about doses and monitoring of medi-cation. There are specic issues about fluctuations of lamo-trigine levels in pregnancy, as mentioned in Chapter 10; itshould be common practice to monitor these during preg- nancy. The GP made no attempt to initiate the recom- mended treatment. This lady was clearly ambivalent aboutmedication, perhaps because of worries of adverse effectson the baby, but both her GP and neurologist should haveexplored this with her in more detail. Risks of bathing alone As has been seen in earlier Reports, and in this, women still drown in the bath having had an epileptic seizure, some- times with the door locked. This risk is generally not wellrecognised, and all epileptic women should be advised toshower, rather than bathe, and not to lock the bathroomdoor. A safety leaflet from Epilepsy Action is available at www.epilepsy.org.uk/info/safety. Every epileptic woman of child-bearing age needs to understand the need for pre-pregnancy counselling and high-risk care during pregnancy. This is discussed in more detail under 'Managing pre-existing diseases'. Epilepsy in pregnancy: learning points Epileptic women of child-bearing age need to be informed of the risks of epilepsy in pregnancy before conception. If ts increase or recur in pregnancy, a woman shouldbe referred to a neurologist who should see themwithin a week. Lamotrigine levels need monitoring during pregnancy. Pregnant women should be advised to shower, ratherthan bathe, and not to lock the bathroom door. Asthma Three women dying from asthma received substandard GPcare. They were all women with severe asthma who shouldhave been under the care of respiratory physicians duringpregnancy. For example: A mother with severe asthma (history of several respiratory arrests) stopped her inhaled corticosteroid, possibly on med-ical advice, at the start of pregnancy. The GP included the diagnosis of asthma, but not the severity, in his obstetric referral letter. She was booked for low-risk maternity care.She requested and obtained many repeat prescriptions forsalbutamol during pregnancy. A few days after delivery shedeveloped a chest infection and was treated with antibiotics;her peak flow (PF) was 200 l/minute (44% of her predictedShakespeare 162 Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203PF 450 l/minute). She was subsequently treated with prednisolone, but her PF, pulse and respiratory rate werenot recorded and no follow up was arranged. A few weekslater, she suddenly became breathless, collapsed and died ofasthma. She was inaccurately advised about stopping her inhaled corticosteroid in pregnancy and was clearly requestingexcessive repeat prescriptions of salbutamol without the GPnoticing. Postnatally, the severity of her asthma was unrec- ognised, inadequate observations were taken and no follow up was arranged. If she had been treated using nationalguidelines, her death may have been avoided. 3Short- and long-acting beta agonists and inhaled corticosteroids aresafe in pregnancy. In a review of the effects of pregnancy on asthma, 10 increased hospital admission was associated with a lack ofuse of inhaled corticosteroids. In general, the effect of preg- nancy on known asthma was one-third improved, one- third worse and one-third unchanged. Most women withasthma have mild disease and require primary care duringpregnancy. GPs need to provide adequate detail about theseverity of asthma, so that maternity services can assesswomen who need specialist care (see learning points). Asthma: learning points GPs must inform maternity services about the severityof pregnant women's asthma. Most pregnant women with asthma can be cared forin primary care. Only women with persistent poorcontrol, a history of hospital admission as an adult,respiratory arrest or continuous or frequent courses of oral steroids would usually require specialist refer- ral to a chest physician during pregnancy. Psychiatry and substance misuse Deaths from psychiatric causes are counted and discussed in Chapter 11. As in the last Report, there were cases where known previous psychiatric history and family history didnot prompt early psychiatric referral and care planning toanticipate problems after delivery. It appears that GPs arestill not aware that the risk of recurrence of puerperal psy-chosis is about 50% with a previous history. 11With plan- ning, some of these deaths might have been prevented: A pregnant woman had a history of severe postnatal depres- sion that required hospital admission after her previouspregnancy and a family history of psychotic illness. She wastaking venlafaxine before and during pregnancy. She wasbooked for low-risk care because the midwife did not obtain her mental health history at booking. In the third trimester, she was admitted with severe depression but dischargedherself and failed to attend follow-up appointments. After delivery, the midwife, as instructed, telephoned the psychia-trist to say she had delivered, but no follow up wasarranged. She did not see her GP after delivery and died ofviolent means some weeks later. She should not have taken venlafaxine in pregnancy. With her history, she should have been referred to a peri-natal psychiatrist at the start of pregnancy to develop amanagement plan. Following her admission for severe depression in pregnancy and after delivery, the GP should have contacted her. The GP did not communicate with themidwife at any stage. As a result of strategic policy changes,this GP and midwife were no longer working on the samesite and did not share computer systems; this was a barrierto good communication. In another case, despite a detailed postnatal mental- health care plan, as recommended in previous Reports, when the woman became psychotic she was treated at home inappropriately rather than being admitted to hospi-tal as stated in the agreed plan. A care plan needs to be apractical document, rather than a 'tick box' exercise, other-wise it is not worth the paper it is written on. In three other cases where there was no specialist perina- tal service, ill women were not accepted by psychiatric ser-vices because they did not meet the local referral criteria, having been labelled incorrectly as 'anxious'. If specialist perinatal services had been available, they may have beenmore sensitive to the early symptoms of severe depressionor psychosis, and the outcome may have been different. Vulnerable women can pose a challenge for health pro- fessionals: A woman with a history of domestic abuse and a chaotic lifestyle had a previous partner who had died from a heroinoverdose. No personal history of drug use was obtained atbooking. She was referred to social services by the police,having reported abuse. She attended the Emergency Depart- ment in mid-pregnancy after an assault, intoxicated with crack cocaine, but the letter to the GP recorded only theassault. Several safeguarding conferences were held; drugmisuse was recorded in all the reports. The baby was placedon the child protection register from birth. The GP startedher on citalopram for depression shortly after delivery, buthe did not arrange any follow up and did not inform thehealth visitor, who worked on a different site. The woman died of an overdose of alcohol and cocaine a few weeks later. The GP failed to consider the possibility of drug misuse, despite clues from the history. This is a recurring theme of cases examined, probably because women are afraid of the consequences of disclosure. Maintenance treatment duringpregnancy by an addictions team or specialist GP mayChapter 14: General practice \u00aa2011 Centre for (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 163reduce the risks to the woman and her child. The GP did not attend or contribute to the safeguarding meetings orread the reports that clearly mentioned drug misuse. GPsneed to be aware of their responsibilities in safeguardingchildren. 12Finally, he did not arrange follow up or inform the health visitor when he prescribed antidepressants. All the health professionals involved in this woman's careworked from different sites, they had no meetings or mech-anisms for communication and they were all overstretched.This is a reflection of the current fragmentation of care. As in the last Report, a number of deaths from overdoses or suicide occurred around the time of a child protectioncase conference. In this Report, ten women died in such circumstances. Women are afraid of these meetings and avoid services for fear that their child will be removed.They need additional support and surveillance throughthese difcult times, especially if the child is removed. Mental health: learning points Women with a history of psychosis have at least a50% risk of perinatal recurrence. A family history ofpsychosis also increases the risk of puerperal psycho-sis. Women with severe and enduring mental illnessshould be referred by their GP to a mental healthteam, preferably a perinatal service, for care planningearly in pregnancy. GPs need to have established channels of easy com- munication with midwives, health visitors and mental health teams. GPs should be proactive in maintaining contact withwomen with signicant mental health problems, rec-ognising that the women may not initiate contactthemselves. GPs need a higher level of awareness for women whomay be misusing drugs. Managing pre-existing disease Of the 64 cases examined for this chapter, 47 mothers(73%) had pre-existing conditions. This included epilepsy,diabetes, obesity and psychiatric conditions as well as rarediseases. All these women, by denition, should receive consultant-led care, although this may be shared with the midwife and GP. A key recommendation in the last Report, as in this, is that women with pre-existing conditions should haveaccess to pre-conception care. 13While specialist consultants have a responsibility for ensuring this happens, it is the GPwho should be central to coordination. This has been hap-pening for conditions like bipolar disorder, but it seems less likely to happen in conditions such as autoimmune or cardiac disease and very rare conditions.A woman with a rare form of autoimmune disease became pregnant, and her GP referred her immediately to the localobstetric and secondary-care services. He also wrote to thetertiary centre responsible for her care asking for guidanceon management during pregnancy. The tertiary centre failed to provide this. She developed signicant and predict- able complications in the third trimester and died as aresult. This GP provided excellent anticipatory care, by making specialist referrals at the same time as referring to an obste- trician. The outcome from the tertiary referral should havebeen a care plan available in her hand-held records antic-ipating predictable clinical problems with advice aboutappropriate action to take if problems arose. If this womanhad been delivered at the tertiary centre, she may have sur-vived. No one except the GP considered this possibility. GPs may need to make urgent referrals for these women if their condition changes. There was evidence that consul- tants did not always read the letters or make appropriatelyrequested urgent appointments. Choose and Book anddemand management systems to reduce GP referrals andrestrictions on inter-consultant referral should not compro-mise referrals for the care of these women. Written communications and urgent appointments Inadequate written communication was again an issue. GPreferral letters did not always include signicant detailsabout past medical history, such as a diagnosis of hyperten-sion or an accurate record of severity of asthma. There were instances where midwives failed to record signicant past medical history, such as severe mental ill-ness or hypertension, even though the GP referral letterwas clear. Letters to GPs were sometimes inaccurate or incomplete and directly contributed to some deaths; exam- ples include a lack of instructions about blood pressuremonitoring after discharge in a woman with pre-eclampsia,a diagnosis of 'worsening peripheral oedema' rather thanheart failure and vague instructions for starting antiepilep-tics with no recommendation to monitor blood levels. Consultants did not appear to read referral letters and did not always respond to requests for urgent appoint- ments; there were cases of a delay of 4 weeks with a history of hypertension and subarachnoid haemorrhage, a delay of6 weeks after a t in pregnancy and a delay of 5 weeks fora diabetic woman. This may be because this task is nowdelegated to administrative staff. In some situations, a phone call backed up by a letter would be more appropriate; for example, in one case afterthe death of a baby from sepsis, the GP might have been more aware of the risk to the mother if the consultant had spoken to him directly. Phone calls between GPs and con-sultants and vice versa seem to be a disappearing feature ofShakespeare 164 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203the modern health service. Conversations take place between GPs and junior staff, who may have insufcientexperience to offer adequate advice. Telephone communi-cation needs encouragement in both directions; to facilitatethis, GPs need to be prepared to accept consultant calls during surgery. Referrals: learning points Remember, referral is not treatment. If you are concerned or think that an urgent response is required, telephone a senior clinician. Always back up a fax, email or phone call with a writ-ten letter (remember to copy in the midwife). Include in the referral letter details of: scurrent problem and reason for referral sdetails of any past medical history, including mentalhealth history, even if not directly relevant to thepresenting problem sall medications she is currently on or has recently stopped sinvestigations so far. Changes in service delivery GPs are now rarely involved in routine maternity care. Only three (5%) of the 64 women whose deaths were examined for this chapter were in shared care between the midwife and GP. However, GPs were often consulted in sit-uations that led to death. It is worrying that some GPslacked basic knowledge about identifying and managingcertain conditions, such as DVT, PE or pre-eclampsia. GPsare experts at dealing with uncertainty, especially withcomplex problems. They are also the 'experts' in conditionslike upper respiratory tract infections and asthma and should provide this care in pregnancy. The separation between routine maternity care and routine primary caremay lead to de-skilling of GPs in obstetrics and put moth-ers at risk. In addition, midwives are working increasingly from other premises, such as Children's Centres. This makes itmore difcult to maintain good communication. Therewere examples of this affecting care for the women who died: for example, a woman failed to disclose a history of severe depression to her midwife. Midwives in Children'sCentres do not have access to GP computer records, whichgive details of relevant past medical history, recent consul-tations and results. In the last Report, we recommendedthat 'Whenever possible, a GP should give a named com-munity midwife condential access to the woman's fullwritten and electronic records' (preferably with the woman's consent). This recommendation should be endorsed, but we need to recognise that this has becomemore difcult since the last report because of geographical separation. In this situation, formal ways of communicatingand sharing information need to be developed locally. Information sharing: specic recommendation Whenever possible, a GP should give a named commu- nity midwife condential access to the woman's full writ-ten and electronic records, with the woman's consent. Ifthis is not possible, the GP should supply a named com-munity midwife with a summary of the women's past medical history, with the woman's consent. The impact of a maternal death Dealing with a maternal death is one of the most difcult and upsetting situations that any healthcare worker, includ-ing GPs, may face in the course of a professional life. There may be extreme feelings of guilt, fear of anger from the family and worry about blame from external investigationsor litigation. Sometimes these fears are borne out. It is good practice (and encouraged by Quality and Out- comes Framework) to conduct signicant event auditswithin practice after a maternal death; one example isfound among the vignettes about VTE. But there were alsoexamples where GPs were blamed in Trust enquiries, some- times with justication. This should not happen unless the GP has been invited to contribute and attend. Where a GPwho provided exemplary care was involved in a Trustenquiry, it built understanding. For example: A woman with presumed puerperal psychosis died in violent circumstances a few days after her delivery. There were noapparent risk factors, and her care had been excellent.Excellent care was provided to her husband and familyafter her death, with effective communication between theGP and midwife. The GP was invited to attend the seriousuntoward incident review meeting. All parties welcomed the opportunity to reflect on the death and to ensure that path- ways of communication and support were available for allprofessionals. Following a maternal death, a GP will be approached to provide condential information to the Enquiry. They are expected to provide an extract of the clinical record, theoutcome from a signicant event meeting and some per-sonal reflection about their learning. In 34 cases, the GPhad provided adequate information, but in 15 there wasminimal information and in 15 there was nothing. Thisdoes not seem adequate. Good Medical Practice for GPs 6 states that an exemplary GP 'co-operates with any investi- gation arising from a complaint, and when appropriate instigates changes to prevent any recurrence'.Chapter 14: General practice \u00aa2011 Centre for (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 165Managing a maternal death in general practice: learning points A maternal death should always be regarded as a sig- nicant event within a practice. A GP should engage fully in any Trust enquiry into amaternal death. GPs should forward to the Enquiry an anonymisedfull copy of the woman's pregnancy record, any rele- vant past medical history, the results of a signicant event analysis for any maternal death and any otherreflections on the death. Conclusion GPs remain an important part of the teams that care forpregnant women. This Report focused on tragic situationswhen women died. There are many situations when deathsare unavoidable and where GPs have provided exemplarycare and support. Most GPs are committed to providingexcellent care; they are the experts in managing uncertainty in medicine. However, there are also cases contained in this chapter where care has been less than good, and thereis real concern that GPs are becoming de-skilled in mater-nity care. GPs need to demonstrate that they are compe-tent in maternity care by updating their knowledge andskills so as to manage the emergency situations they mayhave to face. Disclosure of interests None.

Emergency Department: specic recommendations Emergency medicine clinicians should be trained in the identication and management of seriously ill pregnant or recently delivered women, especially those with atypical presentations. They should be able to recognise obstetric emer-gencies and to understand the physiological differences in pregnant women and how these interact with disease processes.They should have a full knowledge of the obstetric aspects of emergency medicine. Emergency medicine clinicians should be aware of the signs and symptoms of the commoner obstetric conditions which might be misattributed to other causes. These messages are contained in the Back to basics section of this Report. The fol- lowing symptoms are important presenting features of potentially serious illness in pregnant and postpartum women: Pyrexia Chest pain Shortness of breath Proteinuria Headache Hypertension Diarrhoea Abdominal pain Vomiting Tachycardia Epigastric pain Pregnancy testing should be carried out in women of childbearing age who present to the Emergency Department (ED) with unexplained symptoms that could be the result of pregnancy-related illness, including gastrointestinalsymptoms. The results must be communicated to the woman and acted upon if necessary. Women who attend the ED frequently should be seen by a senior clinician. A discharge summary should be sent to the woman's GP following every ED attendance and particular issues shouldbe highlighted. These include women with multiple attendances for apparently minor complaints, which can indicatedomestic abuse. The woman's handheld maternity notes should be written in following every ED attendance wherever possible. Equipment and drugs used in the ED should be familiar to all who use them, up to date and t for purpose. Introduction This is the second Report in which a summary chapter hasbeen written especially for emergency medicine clinicians.Once again, a consultant in emergency medicine hasreviewed the relevant maternal deaths where an EmergencyDepartment (ED) was involved and from which lessonsmight be learnt. Although the specic recommendationsand learning points in this chapter are for emergency medi-cine clinicians, all of the key recommendations, most of the learning points in the other chapters and the new summary of common clinical signs and symptoms which may beoverlooked as signs of signicant maternal disease, Back to basics , are also relevant to clinicians practising emergency medicine. This chapter also endorses the recommendationsin the previous Report. 1 Although in many instances the care provided for sick pregnant or recently delivered women by members of staffChapter 15: Emergency medicine \u00aa2011 Centre for (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 167in the ED was of a high quality, issues of concern still remain. In particular, these include the recognition of theseverity of illness and the management of women whoattend one or several EDs on a number of occasions. Background Emergency medicine services Urgent and emergency care in the UK is currently providedby primary care, EDs, minor injury units, urgent care cen-tres, walk-in centres and polyclinics. This multiplication ofpoints of access to the service tends to confuse patients.The majority of patients attend the ED and primary care for their emergency care. Out of hours and at weekends, EDs are open and staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,whereas the other types of services tend to be open a vari-able number of hours and days of the week and are incon-sistently available. Local information about services, theiropening hours and what each can provide therefore needsto be widely available. In the future, it may well be that asingle point of access is the most suitable model for patients and clinicians. During the period of this Report, 2006-08, in England, the 4-hour emergency care operational standard stated that98% of patients must be admitted, transferred or dis-charged within 4 hours of their arrival at the ED. 2This put tremendous pressure on already busy departments, but itwas crucial that safety was not compromised by a need toget the patient through the system to full the operational standard. Even though it may appear that a patient's care is likely to fail to meet an operational target, they must betreated in a timely and appropriate manner and referredcorrectly, rather than discharged too early or sent to thewrong ward just to tick a box. Fortunately, this did notapply to many of the women in this Report. In April 2010,the A & E Clinical Quality Indicators came into force. Early pregnancy assessment units A number of hospitals now have dedicated early pregnancyassessment units (EPAUs), which can assess potential prob-lems in early pregnancy, such as bleeding, that used to beperformed by the ED staff. However, EPAUs are rarelyoperational 24 hours a day, and it is extremely importantthat women with problems know where to go, and when,so that they do not end up in the wrong place at the wrong time because of confusion. This is particularly the case if those EPAUs which see women who are able to self-referare closed. There needs to be clear information for allwomen about the alternative services available to them ifthe unit is closed. These should be matched by protocolsbetween hospital units, EDs and EPAUs, which enable therapid transfer of any woman to the most appropriate placefor her care.An additional issue is that many EDs do not see women with pain or bleeding in early pregnancy, and sothis cohort of women, and the lessons they can provide,is lost to many clinicians. An early pregnancy service thatis available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and that pro- vides a consistent and high-quality service to women is vital. Ambulances and paramedics: prehospital medicine When a pregnant or recently delivered woman collapses inthe community and someone calls 999, an ambulance has aspecic dispatch time target depending on the call category.The ambulance will be staffed by at least one paramedic and possibly an ambulance technician. In addition, in some parts of the UK, rapid response vehicles can be deployedthat also carry paramedics, and there are also now someservices that offer rst-response helicopters, with or with-out doctors on board. Another growing trend has been theemployment of Emergency Care Practitioners\u2014often para-medics with extended clinical skills. These personnel workautonomously and are able to keep a patient at home by following certain protocols. Training for doctors in 'pre- hospital' medicine is becoming more formalised, and thereis now a Faculty of PreHospital Medicine set up by theCollege of Emergency Medicine in conjunction with theRoyal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and the otherRoyal Colleges. The Advanced Life Support Group have setup a Prehospital Obstetric Emergencies Training Course(POET), which is well-established in the UK and is also being successfully used abroad. Summary of key ndings for 2006-08 The main causes of death for the pregnant or recently delivered women who died and had contact with the EDthis triennium were thromboembolism, pre-eclampsia,ectopic pregnancy and cardiac disease. Many of these women received excellent care and moved swiftly through the ED to other specialties. Twenty-seven women died in the ED or shortly after transfer to another critical-care area, the vast majority ofwhom had suffered a cardiac arrest before arrival. Theremaining few arrested in the ED. In all women, cardiopul-monary resuscitation took place. Ten women were thenmoved to other critical-care areas following their successful initial resuscitation, but, for the other 17, resuscitation was discontinued while they were still in the ED. In general,resuscitation guidelines were efciently followed, eventhough outcomes from prehospital arrests are universallypoor. It is undoubtedly the case that attempting to resusci-tate a pregnant woman, with or without an associated peri-mortem caesarean section, is extremely distressing for allstaff involved, partly because it happens so rarely. It isHulbert 168 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203important that support and feedback are given to allow for learning and reflection. All the 17 women who died in the ED also underwent a peri-mortem caesarean section. Most were already under-going cardiopulmonary resuscitation on arrival, and the chance of their own or their baby's survival was already poor. However, of the peri-mortem sections, there was onelive birth, ve early neonatal deaths and the rest were still-born. The gestational ages ranged between 20 and39 weeks. As shown in Chapter 1 of this Report, no babythis triennium survived a peri-mortem caesarean sectionperformed at 28 gestational weeks or less. However, sur-vival rates increase with gestational maturity, and 47% of babies born this way at 36 weeks of gestation or more sur- vived this triennium. However, all but one of these fol-lowed a collapse while the mother was already admitted tohospital. The care the women received All the women who were transferred from the ED following their emergency admission came into contact with critical- care teams or general physicians, in addition to obstetri-cians. In general, the care that they received in the ED wasof a high standard; nevertheless, there are some generalclinical and organisational themes. Clinical practice One of the most important skills of an emergency medicine clinician is the ability to recognise a sick woman at an early stage, as once a woman is in extremis , their chances of sur- vival are much lower. This skill is one which is repeatedlytaught to doctors in training in emergency medicine,whether they are on an Acute Care Common Stem rotationas junior doctors or undergoing higher specialist trainingas a registrar. Basic skills in history-taking, examinationand the appropriate use of special investigations are the building blocks of the recognition of the sick woman. In addition, the management of these women should be basedon regular observations, modied early obstetric warningscores (e.g. MEOWS) and, most importantly, the ability toact on abnormalities in basic parameters such as heart rate,respiratory rate, Glasgow Coma Score, temperature andcapillary rell. Parameters such as blood pressure can bedeceptive and should always be reviewed in context. Thromboembolism In both pregnant and nonpregnant women, the diagnosis ofpulmonary embolism continues to be challenging. Addi-tional tests such as D-dimer measurement may help in cer-tain cases. It is important not to place too much emphasis onspecialist investigations when the trigger to diagnose pulmo-nary embolism is essentially a clinical one. Breathlessness is avery signicant presenting symptom, as also discussed in the Back to basics section of this Report. Signicant breathless- ness of sudden onset in pregnant women, especially in thepresence of tachycardia, mandates that diagnosis of pulmo-nary embolism must be high on the differential diagnosis and excluded. 3 Once pulmonary embolism is part of the differential diagnosis, urgent referral to the physicians and the obstetri-cians is indicated. Similarly, an urgent referral must also bemade if signicant breathlessness is present. It is also extre-mely important that any treatment takes account of awoman's individual circumstances. For example: A woman with a psychiatric disorder and social problems had a family history of thromboembolism. After delivery,she was discharged home on 'self-administered Clexane' butlacked the skills to give herself these injections. Four weeksafter delivery, she attended the ED with calf pain and breathlessness. She was given an injection of low-molecular- weight heparin and was asked to come back next day. Shefailed to do so and 2 weeks later returned with a history ofpleuritic pain, developed severe breathlessness and died. Venous Symptoms of venous thromboembolism include: breath- lessness, tachycardia and leg pain and early obstetricreferral should be considered. Pre-eclampsia Women rarely present to the ED with pre-eclampsia, andit may therefore be hard to recognise. Essentially, anypregnant woman who presents with a headache or abdom-inal pain (particularly epigastric pain) should have theirblood pressure recorded and urine tested for protein.Raised blood pressure or proteinuria mandates a referral to obstetric colleagues, as does the nding of abnormal liver function or haematological tests. Once diagnosed,careful fluid balance and judicious use of anti-hyperten-sives is required. All pregnant women with pre-eclampsia and a systolic blood pressure of 150-160 mmHg or more require anti-hypertensive treatment in line with the recent guidelinesfrom the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). 4If systolic hypertension is very severe (e.g. 160 mmHg or more), treatment needs to be urgent.Consideration should also be given to initiating treatmentat lower pressures if the overall clinical picture suggestsrapid deterioration or where the development of severehypertension can be anticipated. The target systolic bloodpressure after treatment is 150 mmHg.Chapter 15: Emergency medicine Centre for BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 169Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia: learning points Obstetric referral is recommended if any of the follow- ing are present: hypertension proteinurea epigastric pain vomiting. Ectopic pregnancy When the classical triad of symptoms (abdominal pain,vaginal bleeding and syncope) is present, ectopic pregnancy can still be difcult to diagnose. This is mainly because these symptoms can be attributed to other less serious con-ditions, including pregnancy itself. Furthermore, as hasbeen repeatedly stressed in earlier Enquiry reports, ectopicpregnancy often presents with nonspecic symptomssuch as diarrhoea. Unless ectopic pregnancy is high onthe differential diagnosis list, it can be easily missed. Forexample: A woman was referred to hospital by her GP because of diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain, with suspectedgastroenteritis. Her haemoglobin value was 10.9 g/dl with tachycardia on admission, but a pregnancy test was not performed. She was then seen by several junior hospitaldoctors and, during the following few hours, received severallitres of intravenous fluids with a urinary output of lessthan 500 ml and a severe fall in haemoglobin. She diedbefore diagnosis. At autopsy, her abdominal cavity con-tained about nine litres of bloody fluid and clot, togetherwith a ruptured tubal pregnancy. In addition to the classical symptoms of vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain and amenorrhoea, diarrhoea, vomiting andfainting should all be taken seriously with a view to ectopicpregnancy as part of the differential diagnosis. Ultrasound scanning is now part of the curriculum for higher specialist trainees in Emergency Medicine. However,this is Focused Assessment Sonographic Trauma (FAST)scanning, which will simply reveal free fluid in the abdo-men, and not specialised abdominal or indeed transvaginalscanning, which should only be carried out by a clinicianskilled in this diagnostic imaging technique. Women who present with ectopic pregnancy-related symptoms occasionally do not know their pregnant state, and estimation of urine and serum levels of b-human chori- onic gonadotrophin is required. Many departments includepregnancy testing in all women of childbearing age whopresent with abdominal and other nonspecic symptoms.The Early Pregnancy deaths chapter of this Report, Chapter6, also suggests that all women with gastrointestinal symp- toms should be tested. Although this may result in manynegative results, it may well reveal previously unknownpositives. In some cases in this triennium, extremely youngand much older women were not tested and their preg- nancy was missed as a result. In a few other cases, the women were not informed of their pregnancy test results,which may have contributed to their fatal outcome. Therewere also cases of women who did not know that they werepregnant even though this information was entered in thenotes. It is of crucial importance that, once a pregnancy testhas been found to be positive, action results: A very young girl with a complex social history was unwell for a year or so with vomiting and severe loss of weight.Her symptoms were ascribed to an eating disorder, althoughshe did not seem to have been referred for psychiatric care.Early in her illness, she attended the local ED with a history of vomiting, abdominal pain and irregular periods. Her positive pregnancy test at the ED was overlooked and notfollowed up. During the succeeding months, she repeatedlyreturned to the ED with similar symptoms, but no furtherpregnancy test was done, perhaps because of her age. Hersymptoms were either ascribed to an eating disorder or gas-tritis. Nearly a year after her positive pregnancy test, shewas admitted and died of a cerebrovascular accident as the result of a disseminated choriocarcinoma. Ectopic pregnancy: learning points In addition to the classical symptoms of vaginal bleed- ing, abdominal pain and amenorrhoea, the symptoms ofdiarrhoea, vomiting and fainting should all be taken seriously with a view to ectopic pregnancy as part of the differential diagnosis. These features need to be emphas-ised to all clinical staff.All positive pregnancy tests carried out in the EDshould be followed up and acted upon by the relevantclinician. Cardiorespiratory disease The diagnosis of pneumonia in pregnancy can also be chal-lenging, as once again, breathlessness was too often wronglyperceived to be a normal state in pregnancy. Tachycardia is seen in both pneumonia and in other forms of sepsis and may be ignored when other parameters are stable. Tachycardia is particularly relevant in emergencymedicine and should never be allowed to exist in theabsence of a diagnosis. Women who are pregnant but have a co-existing diagno- sis of asthma should be carefully managed, as breathlessnessand wheeze are so often attributed to mild asthma when,Hulbert 170 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203in fact, these symptoms can be forerunners of moderate and severe asthma. In this triennium, wheezing was also asymptom of some women with pulmonary oedema, whichwas missed, as the wheezing was wrongly attributed toasthma. This is a key learning point in Chapter 9. Early referral to the obstetricians is recommended for unex- plained symptoms of wheeze and shortness of breath. A woman who smoked presented to the ED with chest pain and breathlessness some weeks after delivery. Acute coro- nary syndrome was not considered in the differential diag- nosis, possibly in view of a normal electrocardiogram(ECG), her age and the quality of the pain. Serial ECGsand Troponin were not requested and, even though theworking diagnosis was pulmonary embolus, a V/Q scan wasnot performed either. She was discharged from the ClinicalDecision Unit and died shortly afterwards. Cardiorespiratory disease: learning point Wheeze can also mean cardiac disease. In general, as with all other women, abnormal physical ndings in pregnant or recently delivered women should not be ignored. A cause and source must be found to explain all of these before discharge from the ED. Domestic abuse The ED is a clinical area where many women present hav-ing been subject to domestic abuse. Repeated attendanceswith apparently trivial conditions should arouse suspicion,as should an inconsistent or variable history. This subject, including the use of open questioning, is discussed in the Annex to Chapter 12 of this Report. All clinicians, especially those working in the ED, must be trained in recognising undisclosed domestic abuse andunderstand how to offer to help the woman if she is notadmitted. They should also appreciate the increased riskof domestic abuse for pregnant and recently deliveredwomen. Domestic abuse: learning point Women are at increased risk of domestic abuse in preg-nancy. Women who frequently attend the ED with minor inju- ries or apparently trivial complaints should be discussedwith their GP and midwife because these are classicsigns of domestic abuse.Training It is increasingly recognised that in secondary care there ismuch subspecialisation. The only true hospital generalistsare emergency medicine clinicians. It is a huge challenge toinclude teaching on all possible presenting complaints that may come to EDs. Emergency physicians need to be able to recognise a sick woman, pregnant or not. They also need to understand themain presenting features of pregnancy-related illness, howto resuscitate a pregnant woman and carry out caesareansection, if necessary. One of the most important thingsabout teaching in EDs is its multidisciplinary nature, andcertainly nurses and nurse practitioners are highly valued in this environment. In addition, there have to be robust measures to ensure that locum and agency staff can recog-nise sick women, use the appropriate IT systems andadhere to the highest clinical governance rules. Service provision Stafng In addition to providing excellent training and teaching,ED consultants bring high-level senior decision-makingskills to their departments. The College of Emergency Med-icine has recently recommended a minimum of ten whole-time-equivalent consultants in each Department, and thiswill allow for extended hours of consultant shop-floor pres-ence 7 days a week. 5However, to ensure 24-hour consul- tant presence, the need is a minimum of 18 whole-time- equivalent consultants. This is rare in the UK. Some departments have 24-hour middle grade cover. It is crucialthat the junior doctors and nurses know who to call, howto call and when to call if they are concerned about awoman in their care. All EDs should have protocols to ensure that certain groups of pregnant women are always seen by an obstetri-cian. These may include women in any trimester with spec- ied symptoms, those in active labour and those who are clearly unwell. The delivery suite can be some distance from the ED, and, although obstetric consultants may be available on thelabour ward, it is unusual to see an obstetric consultant inthe ED unless a peri-mortem caesarean section is being car-ried out. Hence, EDs rely on the middle grade cover thattheir obstetric unit can provide. This can be problematic in a busy obstetric unit, especially if they are simultaneously supposed to be in the delivery suite and on-call. Isolated stand-alone obstetric units are unpopular with ED clinicians, who believe that safe and high-quality care isoptimised by co-location of specialties. This may notalways be applicable for historical, organisational and cul-tural reasons.Chapter 15: Emergency medicine BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 171Transfers When the obstetric unit is geographically separate from the ED, the woman will need to be transferred at some stage.There is no doubt that the safest environment for thewoman who needs resuscitation, either pregnant or non- pregnant, is the resuscitation room of a well-staffed ED. Junior obstetricians may have fewer general resuscitationskills than clinicians in the ED. Tragedies do occasionally occur when a woman is trans- ferred inappropriately. There is no point in transferring awoman from a general ED to a specialist ward where eitherthere will be a delay in being seen or she will be seen bysomeone less senior. It is much more important to keep her in the ED resuscitation room and have a specialist obstetrician come to her. It is also crucial that paramediccrews know where to take pregnant women on arrival athospital and also to alert the hospital to the incomingpatient wherever possible. Equipment A number of the cases reviewed suggested that either the wrong equipment was present, not enough equipment was present or that the multidisciplinary team were not wellversed in the use of the equipment in the resuscitationroom. There is no point in having resuscitation equipmentthat is unfamiliar, out of date or difcult to use, and this isa failure of the system which can be easily overcome bymeticulous checking. The obstetric team and the ED teamshould agree on the equipment which is required, and this should be maintained at all times. In addition, any member of the multidisciplinary team who is going to use theequipment should be trained in its use. Conclusions Many of the maternal deaths that occurred in the ED wereunavoidable or untreatable, even with the best of care. These were the result of sudden catastrophic cerebral haemorrhage, massive pulmonary embolism or sudden car-diac collapse. However, some other mothers had treatableconditions, the early recognition of which was crucial tothe outcome. Over the past 6 years, since these Reports have involved the specialty of Emergency Medicine, it has becomeincreasingly clear that emergency medicine clinicians need to be trained in the identication and management of obstetric emergencies and to understand the physiologicaldifferences in pregnant women and how these interact with disease processes. They should also have greater knowledgeof obstetric medicine. In addition, protocols should bedeveloped, understood and acted on to enable clear lines ofreferral to senior clinicians, both in their specialty and that of obstetrics. And, to learn from past mistakes, all serious incidents should be reviewed by the whole ED staff on aregular basis. ED staff should also participate in audit andresearch and organise or attend not only their own but alsothe obstetric department mortality and morbidity meetingsif involved in the case. All of these measures will improvethe clinical practice of Emergency Medicine still further. Disclosure of interests None.

Critical care: specic recommendations Early protocol-driven care should be adopted in the management of severe sepsis. The management of severe obstetric haemorrhage is complex and requires multidisciplinary input. Guidelines for the rate and composition of fluid administration should be reviewed. Simulation training should be explored further as a method of improving performance in the management of life-threatening emergencies. Introduction Over half of the all the woman who die each trienniumspend some time in a critical care unit, and many of thosewill die there. Critical care makes advances year on year; some of these really only applicable to critical care medi- cine itself, while others are much more widely applicableand should be adopted in the management of a variety oflife-threatening illnesses in mothers.Critical care is, however, good at being critical 'of' careprovided to patients before admission. This may be appro-priate, and examples of substandard care are regrettablynot hard to nd. It must, however, be cautious; much of the criticism is delivered with hindsight and is directed only at patients who, almost by denition, have failed con-ventional treatment. Seldom, if ever, does critical care lookat patients who, despite being very sick on the ward, havemade a recovery.Critical care units are also a very privileged clinical envi-ronment; few clinical areas can achieve the 1:1 ratio ofhighly trained nursing staff to patients that level III care provides. Critical care must therefore recognise the limita- tions that inevitably restrict the care that can be providedto sick mothers on the ward. Early referral and involve-ment of senior staff from medicine, surgery, anaesthesia,critical care and other specialties is essential, and there ismuch that still can be done to improve maternal survival.A recent survey by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre 1shows that 11.4% of all women aged between 16 and 50 years admitted to critical care wereobstetric patients; over 80% were reported as 'recently'pregnant rather than 'currently' pregnant. Just under two-thirds of obstetric patients were admitted for obstetricreasons. Nearly 90% of 'currently' pregnant women wereadmitted for non-obstetric 20% of these withpneumonia. The most common pregnancy-related diagno- sis was haemorrhage, which was the reason for 34% of such admissions. The survey conrms previous ndingsthat overall obstetric patients admitted to critical carehave a much lower mortality than matched controls.In slight contrast to critical care chapters in previousReports, this one selects some of the greatest challenges fac-ing those caring for acutely sick mothers and explores howadvances in critical care can be more generally applied. Sepsis Sepsis has, for the rst time, become the leading cause ofDirect maternal deaths and remains an important cause of deaths in critical care outside obstetrics. This raises severalimportant questions. Does pregnancy have a particularimpact on the susceptibility to severe sepsis? If severe sepsisoccurs, then does pregnancy influence the chances of sur- vival? Can pregnancy mask the signs of impending sepsis and so lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment? Or is itChapter 16: Critical care \u00aa2011 Centre (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 173simply the case that severe sepsis has a high mortality whether associated with pregnancy or not?A survey of critical care admissions between 1995 and 2000conducted by the Intensive Care National Audit andResearch Centre recorded 21 000 people with sepsis admit- ted to critical care units each year with a mortality rate of between 30 and 50%. This gure continues to rise, andestimates of over 35 000 cases a year in 2009 and 2010 havebeen proposed. In the USA, it is estimated that there willbe 934 000 new cases of sepsis in 2010. The estimated inci-dence of bacteraemia in obstetric patients in the USA hasbeen quoted as around 7.5 per 1000, with approximately8-10% of these going on to develop sepsis. The incidence of septic shock, again from US gures, is quoted at 2.3 per 100 000 maternities. 2The maternal mortality rate from sepsis in 2006-08 is 1.13 per 100 000 maternities (95% CI0.77-1.67), as discussed in Chapter 7. For example: A previously t young mother had a normal vaginal deliv- ery at term. She presented a few days later to her GP witha sore and cracked nipple and was pyrexial and had atachycardia. She was prescribed oral flucloxacillin butrequired admission to a ward tachycardic andhypotensive. She was given intravenous co-amoxiclav andmetronidazole, but hours later she collapsed very hypoten-sive and tachycardic. A few hours after that, she was admitted to the critical care unit and required endotracheal intubation. Following extensive surgery, including a mastec-tomy, she developed renal failure, acute respiratory distresssyndrome (ARDS) and was heavily vasopressor dependent.She died some days later having had maximal critical caretreatment. Subsequent cultures grew Group A b-haemolytic streptococcus. The majority of sepsis seen in an obstetric population is bacterial and typically from organisms sensitive to widelyavailable antibiotics. (Although penicillin would have beena better choice in the case above, the organism was almost certainly sensitive to co-amoxiclav). Why, then, does sepsis present such a challenge to modern critical care both forobstetric and non-obstetric admissions? Answering thisrequires some exploration of both what is meant by sepsisand the complex pathophysiology associated with the moresevere forms. This is necessarily a brief overview, and thewhole subject is one of rapidly changing theories asresearch continues. Over the last 20 years, our understanding of sepsis has been helped by a clearer denition of the various stages encoun-tered as the disease progresses. 3Bacteraemia occurs when viable bacteria are present in the blood stream (fungaemiaor viraemia may be alternatives); this progresses to aSystemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) whenthe host mounts an acute inflammatory response. Sepsis per seoccurs when SIRS is present along with an identiablepathogenic organism. Sepsis progresses to Severe Sepsis when organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion or hypotension ispresent. Finally, the most severe form of sepsis, SepticShock, is dened as sepsis with refractory arterial hypoten-sion despite adequate fluid resuscitation. SIRS is dened as the presence of two or more of the fol- lowing: body temperature <36 /C176C or >38 /C176C heart rate >90 beats per minute respiratory rate >20 breaths per minute white blood cell count <4 \u00b7109cells/l or >12\u00b7109cells/l in nonpregnant patients The speed and intensity of progression through the various stages is determined by a complex balance between the vir- ulence and pathogenicity of the infecting organisms, thenature of the host inflammatory response, co-existing clini-cal conditions (which must include pregnancy), age andthe polymorphism in immune effector molecules and theirreceptors. In bacterial sepsis, cell wall components of Gram-positive bacteria and components of outer cell membranes in Gram-negative bacteria (lipopolysaccharides) bind to car- rier proteins, which in turn bind to monocyte receptors(CD14/TLR4/MD2 complex). This leads to transcription ofpro-inflammatory genes and to the subsequent secretion ofpro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis fac-tor-a(TNF- a) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Cytokines have a wide range of effects on cells and phys- iological processes. The TNF- ais a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils, helping them to stick to endothelial cells (already upregulated in sepsis) to aid migration; it alsostimulates the liver to an acute-phase response withincreased C-reactive protein production. TNF- aalso has effects on the clotting cascade and downregulates the endo-thelial expression of thrombomodulin, which in turn leadsto a reduction in activated protein C (a naturally occurringanticoagulant). The net effect is procoagulant and leads to the formation of microvascular clots, cell damage and dis- ruption of mitochondrial function. Given the unpleasant and widespread nature of such a cytokine 'storm', it is perhaps not surprising that almost allthe organ systems are affected to a greater or lesser extent. Cardiovascular In mild or early sepsis, the cardiovascular changes are very similar to those seen later in pregnancy and in the early puerperium with a rise in heart rate and cardiacoutput and a modest fall in systemic vascular resistance.As sepsis becomes severe, there is a loss of vasomotortone as large amounts of nitric oxide are produced fromthe upregulation of the inducible form of nitric oxidesynthase. Myocardial depression also occurs with a reduc-tion in both right and left ventricular ejection fractionsClutton-Brock 174 \u00aa2011 Centre for 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203and ventricular dilatation; a fall in preload secondary to vasodilatation, can lead to dramaticfalls in cardiac output in severe sepsis. The damage to themicrocirculation probably combines with a direct toxiceffect from higher oxides of nitrogen to seriously impair mitochondrial function, with a metabolic and lactic acido- sis as the result. Respiratory The adhesion of neutrophils to the pulmonary capillaryendothelium increases permeability and leads to interstitialoedema and an increase in extravascular lung water. Preg-nancy is known to reduce the colloid oncotic pressure of blood, and this will further exacerbate the leakage of fluid from the circulation. The effect of the oedema is to pro-duce alveolar collapse leading to V:Q mismatch from intra-pulmonary shunting and subsequent arterial hypoxaemia.This process is commonly termed Acute Respiratory Dis-tress Syndrome and, when severe in its own right, has amortality of between 30 and 60%. Renal Acute renal failure is present in over 20% of patients withsevere sepsis and in almost all patients with septic shock.The cause is usually attributed to acute tubular necrosissecondary to renal hypoperfusion combined with increasedrenal sympathetic activity and cytokine mediated renal cellinjury. Recently, the role of acute tubular necrosis has beenquestioned; what is without doubt is that renal failure is common in severe sepsis. Clotting Thrombocytopenia and a consumptive coagulopathy are common in severe sepsis but are counterbalanced by thehyper-coagulable state described above. The overall result isa picture of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Treatment of maternal sepsis The increasing use of modied early obstetric warningscoring systems (MEOWs) and collaboration between out-reach and maternity teams will go some way to improvingearlier detection, although this remains a challenge for bothobstetric and non-obstetric patients. The complex andwidespread effects of sepsis described above hopefully go some way to explain why effective treatments have proved so elusive. The concept of 'Care Bundles' was mentionedbriefly in the previous report with a description of the Sur-viving Sepsis Campaign (http://www.survivingsepsis.org). 4 This remains the best evidenced package of treatment forsepsis, but, despite its relative simplicity, uptake has beenslow. As is apparent from the more detailed descriptionbelow, time is of the essence in initiating treatment, andthe early stages should start before admission to critical care. Clinical staff caring for mothers who demonstrate thesigns of sepsis should be aware of the recommended stepsand should be able to start treatment. Early and promptreferral to critical care is paramount, and patient manage- ment should be discussed at a senior clinical level even if immediate admission is either not yet required or impossi-ble because of bed availability. The details and the evidence supporting the Surviving Sepsis Campaign were extensively reviewed in 2008, andInternational guidelines for the management of severe sep-sis and septic shock derived from a consensus approachwere described in detail. 5 There is increasing evidence that early protocol-based resuscitation improves outcome;6the currently recom- mended steps are listed below and should be initiated whenthe diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock has beenmade, or is strongly suspected. Here septic shock is dened as tissue hypoperfusion (hypotension persisting after initial fluid challenge or ablood lactate concentration equal to or >4 mmol/l). Initial access and take bloods cultureand lactate intravenous antibiotics within 1 hour fluid resuscitation call for help from Critical Care/anaesthesia early For the rst 6 hours of resuscitation, attempts should be made to achieve all of the following goals: central venous pressure (CVP): 8-12 mmHg mean arterial pressure (MAP) 65 mmHg urine output 0.5 ml/kg per hour 1 central venous (superior vena cava) or mixed venous (superior venous oxygen saturation etc Central venous saturations are increasingly being used as a surrogate for true mixed venous saturations sampledfrom the pulmonary artery. They are easy to perform: asample of blood is taken from a central venous catheterinto a heparinised blood gas syringe and analysed in ablood gas analyser. More accurate results are obtained ifthe blood gas analyser incorporates a CO-oximeter ratherthan calculating the The central venous satura- tion typically around 5% higher than the mixed venous saturation and represents the balance between global oxy-gen delivery and consumption. Global oxygen delivery isthe product of haemoglobin concentration, arterial satura-tion and cardiac output. Central venous saturationtherefore gives an insight into whole body cardiovascularstatus.Chapter 16: Critical care \u00aa2011 Centre for (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 175Diagnosis of sepsis Take blood cultures (preferably two), ideally before the rst dose of antibiotics is given, provided that this does notdelay antibiotic administration. Take cultures from other sites such as vaginal swabs, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, wounds, respiratory secretions, or other body fluids that may be the source of infectionbefore antibiotic therapy, again provided that this does notdelay antibiotic administration. Appropriate imaging should be arranged as early as pos- sible; this may include chest X-rays, ultrasound and com-puted tomography as appropriate. Rapid antigen detection tests for urine are available for a number of bacteria and have been described for group A b-haemolytic streptococcus . These may prove useful in adjusting antibiotic therapy in the future, but treatmentshould not be delayed for test results to be available. Antibiotic therapy Intravenous antibiotic therapy should be started as early as possible and certainly within the rst hour of recognition of septic shock or severe sepsis without septic shock. As described above, appropriate cultures should be obtainedbefore giving antibiotics, if possible, but should not delayadministration. Microbiology input should be sought as amatter of urgency, and antibiotic regimens should beadjusted as advised. Source control Identifying and removing the source of the sepsis is a pri-ority and ideally should be achieved within 6 hours of pre-sentation. The genital tract is clearly an important siteduring pregnancy and the puerperium, but other sites suchas chest or intra-abdominal area may be culprits. Line-related sepsis is an important source in patients already incritical care units. Fluid therapy There is no evidence to support the use of a particular typeof fluid in the resuscitation of sepsis (with the exception ofdextrose solutions, which should not be used). Severalstudies have failed to show signicant differences betweencrystalloid solutions (Hartmann's saline solutionsetc.) and colloids (human albumin solution, starch solu-tions, gelatin solutions, etc.). Concerns have been raised about the effects of starch solutions on renal function, and crystalloid solutions are universally cheaper. Intravenous fluids should be given rapidly to achieve a target central venous pressure of at least 8 mmHg(12 mmHg in ventilated patients). Infusion rates of atleast 1000 ml of crystalloid or 300-500 ml of colloidsshould be given over 30 minutes and continued providedthere is haemodynamic improvement. In the event thatthe central venous pressure (or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, if measured) increases without signicant haemo-dynamic improvement, then fluid administration shouldbe slowed. Vasopressors In many sick patients, the target mean arterial pressure of65 mmHg cannot be achieved by fluid infusion alone, probably because of the extensive collapse in vascular tonecaused by nitric oxide release. Noradrenaline or dopamineshould be used as soon as central venous access has beenestablished. (As a guide, diluting 4 mg of noradrenaline to50 ml with 5% dextrose and starting at an infusion rate of 5 ml/hour is equivalent to 0.1 lg/kg per minute in a 63-kg woman and is a reasonable starting point. Similarly, dilut-ing 200 mg of dopamine to 50 ml and starting at 5 ml/hour is equivalent to 5 lg/kg per minute in a 63-kg woman). Inotropes Dobutamine is recommended as the inotrope of choice where there is evidence of a reduced cardiac output in the presence of elevated cardiac lling pressures. There is noevidence to support the practice of trying to increase thecardiac index to supranormal levels. Corticosteroids The use of high-dose corticosteroid therapy no longer hasa place in the management of sepsis, however severe. There is, however, some evidence to support the use of low-dose (<300 mg/day hydrocortisone) treatment in septic womenwho are unresponsive to fluid and vasopressors. Therapyshould be weaned off as soon as vasopressors are no longerrequired. Recombinant human activated protein C The role of giving activated protein C in sepsis to address the reduction from the downregulation of the endothelial expression of thrombomodulin has been extensively investi-gated by large randomised controlled trials. The current rec-ommendations are that it should be reserved for patientswith a high risk of death (Acute Physiology and ChronicHealth Evaluation II [APACHE II] scores of 25). The risks of bleeding outweigh its benets in less seriously ill groupsand are of particular concern in postoperative sepsis. Blood products What evidence there is supports keeping the haemoglobinbetween 7 and 9 g/dl. Platelets should be administered tokeep the count above 5 \u00b710 9/l at all times, at 5-30 \u00b7109/l if there is a signicant risk of bleeding and at 50\u00b7109/l if surgery is required. There is no evidence to support the useof fresh frozen plasma in the absence of bleeding.Clutton-Brock 176 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203Respiratory support Acute lung injury (ALI) or ARDS are commonly present in patients with severe sepsis. Because they are also features ofseveral other conditions that bring mothers to critical care,they are dealt with in a separate section. Glucose control Considerable excitement resulted from the publication in2001 of an apparent reduction in mortality in surgical criti-cal care patients following tight glucose control by insulininfusions. Subsequent studies have not found such an effectand indeed have shown a signicant rise in hypoglycaemicepisodes in patient with tight glycaemic control. Currently, maintaining levels between 6 and 8 mmol/l is widely prac- ticed. The guidelines also contain advice about renal replace- ment therapy, stress ulcer prophylaxis, prevention of deepvein thrombosis and selective decontamination of the gas-trointestinal tract. These, however, are part of longer-termcritical care management and so are not discussed in detail. Many of the above treatment steps can be carried out before admission to critical care; all could be carried out in the emergency department, an obstetric high-dependencyunit or in the operating theatre. Time is of the essence: the2005 SSC guidelines estimated that each hour's delay inappropriate antibiotic administration reduces the chance ofsurvival by 7.9%. Exactly what the future holds for the management of sepsis in mothers is unclear; research into trying to block or impede the cytokine storm at several points, including anti-TNF- adrugs and Toll-like receptor 4 antagonists, con- tinues. In what may be a permanent absence of 'wonder'drugs, doing relatively simple things well and promptly willsave lives. Acute respiratory syndrome The development of ARDS is a feature of many of themothers admitted to critical care. ARDS is another complexcondition that is most easily described as the lungs'response to systemic inflammation. The changes seen insevere maternal sepsis have been described above,but ARDS can also be a consequence of major haemorrhage,blood product administration and amniotic fluid embolus. The essentials of management remain the removal of the triggering factor(s) and supportive treatments principally centred around mechanical ventilation. ARDS and its lesssevere form acute lung injury are now well dened. Theyare both diseases with an acute onset, bilateral inltrates onchest X-ray, typically with sparing of the costophrenicangles, and either a capillary wedge pressure of <18 mmHgor other evidence of good cardiac function. If the Pa O2:- FiO2ratio is <40 kPa (300 Pulmonary oedema from capillary endothelial damage occurs as described above and is accompanied by dysfunc-tion of type II alveolar epithelial cells with a concomitant reduction in surfactant production. The extent of the development of pulmonary brosis is a variable featureand, unlike other forms of pulmonary brosis, appears tobe largely reversible. Eradication of secondary pulmonary sepsis is essential but can be challenging, and the major changes of the lastfew years have centred around reducing the damagecaused by mechanical ventilation. The use of lower tidal volumes, careful recruitment manoeuvres, high frequency oscillation and a resurgence of interest in extracorporealsupport are all under investigation. As with sepsis, preg-nancy has been an exclusion criterion for most of theARDS trials, including the important National Institutesof Health (NIH) study from the USA, 7which led to the adoption of the 6 ml/kg tidal volume. The reduction inchest wall compliance seen in late pregnancy has led to the suggestion that higher airway pressures may be better tolerated, but, as the reduction in compliance has pulmo-nary components as well, it seems safer to err on theside of caution and adopt the same tidal volumes as fornon-pregnant patients. Many patients requiring prolonged ventilation will have a tracheostomy performed during their critical care stay,typically performed by percutaneous dilatation; the opti- mum timing is still undergoing considerable investigation. Tracheostomy is not without its own hazards, however: A young mother had a massive postpartum haemorrhage following the removal of a retained placenta. She developed ARDS in critical care and was managed with a range of ventilatory strategies, including prone ventilation. Followinga trial of extubation, she had a surgical tracheostomy day 7: laryngeal and tracheal oedema were this time. The following day, the tracheostomy tubebecame dislodged and was replaced with difculty, only tobe dislodged again within 24 hours. This time, not onlycould the tracheostomy not be replaced but oral endotra- cheal intubation proved impossible as well, and she died from a hypoxic cardiac arrest. The tragedy is all the more poignant here because it appears that she had made an almost complete recovery from her ARDS. Amniotic fluid embolism An older mother was delivered by ventouse and was apparentlywell after delivery. However, she had a cardiac arrest withinhalf an hour and underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation forChapter 16: Critical care \u00aa2011 Centre (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 177pulseless electrical activity for 20 minutes, receiving both boluses and an infusion of adrenaline. She began to bleedtorrentially and was transferred to the operating theatre where,despite extensive transfusion, she developed a severe metabolicacidosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. A trans- oesophageal echocardiogram showed good right ventricular function, and she was transferred to the critical care unit.Despite external iliac balloon occlusion, it proved impossible tocontrol the bleeding, and she died. Post-mortem examinationconrmed the diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) anddisseminated intravascular coagulation. Although rare, AFE is of interest to the critical care community because it contains many of the features com- mon to other acute life-threatening illnesses. The incidence quoted for AFE varies greatly, and gures between 1.2 and12.5 per 100 000 maternities come out of the USA. TheUK gure for this triennium is close to 2 per 100 000maternities. Case fatality rates vary between 61 and 86% inthe US literature, 34% being the gure from the UK inthis report. Typically, AFE presents with acute shortness of breath fol- lowed by cardiovascular collapse, so making the alternative diagnosis of massive pulmonary embolus a common one.There appears to be an acute ventilation-perfusion mismatchwith subsequent hypoxaemia presumed secondary to the em-bolisation of material into the lungs. The respiratory effectsare accompanied by an acute reduction in left ventricularfunction, often accompanied by cardiac arrhythmias. Animalmodels show a transient rise in pulmonary artery pressures followed by severe left ventricular dysfunction. This is in contrast to massive pulmonary embolus where the right ven-tricle is primarily affected. Isolated human case reports havedescribed acute right ventricular dysfunction as well. If themother survives the acute phase, then a condition similar tosevere sepsis ensues with an elevated cardiac output andhypotension from a loss of vasomotor tone. Disseminatedintravascular coagulation is present in up to 83% of cases and undoubtedly played a major role in the death of the mother described above. Convulsions are also seen in theacute phase of the illness. The condition, then, has features of both anaphylaxis and severe sepsis. Why this may be is still unclear, but ara-chidonic acid metabolites are present in amniotic fluid andmay be the culprits. Haemorrhage Major obstetric haemorrhage (>1000 ml) occurs in approx-imately 40 per 100 000 births in the UK, but the mortalityhas fallen to just over 0.35 per 100 000 maternities (95%CI 0.17-0.70), as discussed in Chapter 4. This success ismost likely to be a result of better multidisciplinary care,better surgical intervention and the introduction of inter-ventional radiology. Despite this, the management of the acute and serious bleed remains a concern: A mother had a normal vaginal delivery complicated by a retained placenta. She had the placenta removed in the oper-ating theatre under spinal anaesthesia, followed by brisk vagi-nal bleeding. She returned to theatre for a secondexamination, followed by a laparotomy under general anaes-thesia. Eventually a hysterectomy was performed, the wholeprocedure lasting more than 3\u00bd hours. During the procedure, she received 3.5 l gelatine-based colloids, 1 l starch-based col- loids, 10 units of re-suspended red cells, 2.8 l of crystalloidsand 10 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). At the end of theoperation, her blood results showed: haemoglobin 5.0 g/dl,ionised calcium 0.87 mmol/l, Base excess Ratio (INR) 5.5; her platelet count isnot recorded. She went on to develop ARDS which largelyresolved. She died from airway obstruction after displacement of her tracheostomy (described above). Her low haemoglobin would suggest that either the blood loss had been underestimated or that some difculty had been experienced in obtaining red cells. The Interna- tional Normalised Ratio of 5.5 demonstrates just howmuch FFP is required to correct the dilutional coagulopa-thy that inevitably occurs when such large amounts of syn-thetic colloids and crystalloid are given. No mention ismade of her platelet count: if platelets had not been given,then this will have fallen precipitously as well. In November 2009, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists published a revised Green-top Guide- line 8on the prevention and management of postpartum haemorrhage. This proposes a useful division of majorhaemorrhage into moderate (1000-2000 ml) and severe(>2000 ml). The guideline also stresses the importanceof obtaining senior obstetric and anaesthetic help early,as well as communication with blood transfusion andportering. The guideline also supports a structured approach to resuscitation and the need to obtain good intravenousaccess quickly while at the same time cross-matchingblood. The recommendation to cross-match just 4 unitsinitially is adequate for a major haemorrhage that is rapidlycontrolled but will be inadequate for the magnitude ofbleeds typically reported to the Condential Enquiry. Blood can be cross-matched very quickly with modern technology, particularly if the patient's blood group is already known (as it typically is), but signicant delays canbe introduced during transport. The best approach is to beasking for what will be required in 45 minutes time; youshould already have what you need now! The guideline also recommends the widely accepted pro- cedure of giving up to 3.5 l warmed crystalloid followed bya maximum of 1.5 l warmed colloid if blood is still notClutton-Brock 178 \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203available. Even taking account of the increase in blood vol- ume at term pregnancy by up to 50%, 5 l 'clear' fluids willproduce extreme fluid resuscitation during major haemorrhage continues to be controversial. The concept of 'hypotensive resuscitation' has been widely accepted in trauma but lessso for other causes of major haemorrhage. Fluid resuscitation in major haemorrhage should take into account an understanding of the physiologicalprocesses involved. The body's natural response to blood loss includes a rise in heart rate, a fall in blood pressure and vasoconstriction with diversion of cardiac output to vital organs. Clearly if the blood pressure is allowed to fall too low, then organdamage will result, but it is certainly unnecessary to restoreblood pressure levels to normal to prevent this. Indeed,doing so will simply cause further bleeding unless thesource of the bleeding has been controlled. Stopping thebleeding must therefore always be the priority once the cir-culation has been restored to life-sustaining levels. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guide- lines for fluid resuscitation in trauma dene this as thepresence of a radial pulse. 9Equally important is the under- standing that fluid in the sucker bottle and on the swabs iswhole blood whereas the 'blood' being transfused is simply a suspension of red cells in saline. FFP, cryoprecipitate andplatelets will all be needed to restore coagulation in severehaemorrhage. The mother who is bleeding is losing whole blood; we no longer have fresh whole blood to give back and so must instead give back a suitable mix of compo-nents if oxygen-carrying capacity and coagulation are to bemaintained. The move towards 1:1 red cells, FFP transfu-sion both in the battle eld and when massive transfusionis expected, is a signicant advance. Our haematology colleagues are correctly protective of blood products, because they are a nite and valuable resource; however, preventing further whole blood loss from extreme coagulopathy will reduce the overall usage ofblood products. Perhaps we should stop calling re-sus-pended red cells 'blood'? Simulation Simulation training in a variety of forms has been men-tioned in previous Reports, so why discuss it again? It is without doubt that simulation training is on the increase across multiple specialties; most, if not all, medical studentshave been exposed to more or less sophisticated simulationduring their training and increasingly it is being used inthe training of junior doctors. The word 'simulation' coversa large range of very different activities, from 'skills &drills' (Basic Life Support being a good example) rightthrough to very complex multidisciplinary team training in purpose-built simulation suites. Very high levels of realismcan be achieved with high delity simulators, and theextensive use of de-brieng is commonplace. The detractors from simulation ask for level 1 evidence that it improves clinical performance and saves lives; there is little to say in reply. One suspects, though, that the gen-eral public will need less convincing; the proposal that weshould all demonstrate prociency in managing rare butlife-threatening emergencies relevant to our clinical practicewould seem to require little justication. The expense of building and maintaining purpose-built simulation facilities is considerable, and, more recently, a new generation of medium-delity manikins have been developed. These are highly transportable and make theprospect of delivering simulation training in existing clini-cal facilities much more feasible. As all the professionalbodies make the standards they expect their members toperform clearer, and revalidation for doctors has nowarrived, there are opportunities to influence the minimumstandards to which all staff should perform. Conclusions Mothers still die every year in this country. Some diedespite having received the very best care we can offer;some could no doubt have been saved if the care theyreceived had been delivered more promptly, in a morestructured fashion and by better trained staff. There is evi- dence that some of the lessons from previous enquiries have been put into practice, the use of the MEOWS chartsand outreach teams being good examples. There remain,however, many signicant challenges, the management ofsevere sepsis and severe postpartum haemorrhage to namejust two. There are lessons to be learnt from advances in critical care medicine by caring for all mothers; in particular, the delivery of protocol-driven treatment for life-threatening illnesses can save lives but frequently needs to be startedbefore admission to a critical care unit.

The number of locations where they are performed should be reduced, with specialist pathologists taking them on as part of agreed job plans. More clinical discretion overreporting maternal deaths to coroners is required, and there should be a complementary major input by clinicians into obtaining more consented hospital autopsies. Introduction The Royal Colleges of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and of Pathologists both recommend that an autopsy be per-formed on as many maternal deaths as possible to learnfrom the results. In this triennial report, the discussion of the pathology of maternal death and autopsy issues is presented in a new for-mat. This chapter gives a generic overview of the issues andproblems in providing optimum accounts, from the autopsy process, of what happened when a mother died. The pathol- ogy of maternal deaths may be varied but is not especiallydifcult, and even those with minimal experience in thisarea could produce a good quality report by following theRoyal College of Pathologists guidelines. These have justbeen updated and are available online 1but for convenience are included in part here at Annex 17.1. Maternal deathpathology has also been recently reviewed. 2,3 The specic conditions of maternal morbidity and mor- tality that are presented in the earlier chapters on Direct and Indirect maternal deaths now have their own accompa- nying pathological commentaries and pathological learningpoints. These focus on the autopsy evaluation and changingconcepts of the clinical pathology and epidemiology. In par-ticular, there are advances in the consideration of twonumerically increasing clinical pathologies: deaths from sep- sis, and deaths from cardiac disease. They receive a more detailed consideration than hitherto in these Reports, andfor sepsis, a new pathogenetic classication is presented tostimulate new thinking on how these deaths might be pre- vented. This is annexed to Chapter 7. Cases reviewed There were autopsies on 221 of the 261 (85%) Direct and Indirect deaths that occurred in this 3-year period for 2006- 08. The pathology assessors have reviewed the Centre forMaternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE) case les, the sum- maries of the regional pathology assessors and the other clinical assessors and the autopsy reports, with the intent todetermine the precise cause of death and the events that ledto the death. In a minority of cases, this involves disagreeingwith the diagnosis presented by the original pathologist andconcluding that a different cause of death was denitely rel-evant or more likely. In nine cases, we concluded that thecause of death is unascertained and so cannot be categorised with certainty into any of the sections of this report except as 'Unresolved deaths'. Such failures of the autopsy diagnostic process are regret- table. Some follow from dreadfully inadequate autopsieswhere not even the simplest observations and considerationof events have been made and presented in the autopsyreport. But there are also cases where the scenario of death isunclear and the clinical pathology is evidently difcult to evaluate, and, despite doing an overall good job, the patholo- gist has failed to test for or exclude a specic critical diagno-sis that could alter the whole view of the case. For example: A woman with type 2 diabetes was started on insulin in her second trimester when her blood pressure was 145/Chapter 17: Pathology overview \u00aa2011 Centre for BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 18195 mmHg. This was not checked over the next few weeks, and there was no testing for proteinuria. She died suddenlyat home: a bitten tongue and subcutaneous oedema were theonly ndings at autopsy, but no toxicology or biochemicalanalyses were performed and there was no search for pre- eclampsia or eclampsia on histology. The cause of death was given as unascertained. The medico-legal autopsy The great majority of maternal death autopsies areperformed under the instruction of a coroner (England,Wales and Northern Ireland) or Procurator Fiscal (Scotland). In this triennium, only 10% were consented autopsies where the only intent is to provide a fullexplanation of the death, rather than satisfy a morelimited medico-legal inquiry. Under current coronial legislation and regulations, a death is reported to a coroner when it is suspected to beunnatural (which includes iatrogenic factors), occurs incustody or a doctor cannot compose a medical certicate of cause of death 'to the best of his knowledge and belief', that is the cause of death is not known. If the cause ofdeath is 'natural', as most maternal deaths are, then it isnot a legal requirement of the current coronial system thatthe autopsy cause of death be accurate and true. And it isnot an expectation that such autopsy reports will be scruti-nised in detail by numerous peers, as occurs in theseCMACE triennial reviews. Another factor that militates against universal good prac- tice is the enhanced coronial control over tissue samplingand other analyses that take place after the gross autopsy.The events of Alder Hey and Bristol at the turn of the mil-lennium led to the subsequent Human Tissue Act 2004 4and the institution of the Human Tissue Authority (in 2006)5 with its compendious regulations on the working of thepost-mortem sector. As a result, there has been documented increasing pressure on pathologists not to take tissue sam- ples from dead people. That said, it is gratifying that mater-nal autopsies defy that trend: the proportion of medico-legal autopsies on Direct and Indirect maternal deaths that had at least some histopathology performed was 191 of 219(87%)\u2014and in Scotland, the sampling rate was 100%.These are signicantly greater than the overall 19% ratedocumented by the National Condential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death for all coronial autopsies sam- pled in England and Wales in 2005. 6 Another adverse factor that could affect the assessment is a long delay between death and the autopsy. In sevenof the Direct deaths (9%), there was a delay of 4 days or more. Autolysis probably adversely affected the assessmentin two deaths clinically attributed to amniotic fluid embo-lism. In one with a 6-day delay, 'squames' were foundnot only in pulmonary vessels but also in glomeruli. No immunocytochemistry was performed. Because of the clin-ical presentation, we accept that this death was the resultof amniotic fluid embolus but are concerned that a pro-longed delay leading to misinterpretation of desquamating endothelium can be a critical issue. In the second exam- ple, following a 5-day delay and where the clinical diag-nosis also was amniotic fluid embolus, macroscopicallythere was a mottled liver and kidneys, and no squameswere found on routine microscopy. Unfortunately, therewas no immunocytochemical search for squames and norenal histology. The assessors regard the cause as unascer-tained. Maternal autopsy quality in the past The 5th Condential Enquiry Report for 1997-997was the rst of these triennial Enquiries to assess the quality ofautopsies in any great depth. It identied a high proportionof very bad or appalling autopsy reports from the Londonarea, with many seemingly being conducted in public mortuaries by forensic pathologists and, as such, isolated from clinical information and from ready access to addi-tional facilities such as microbiology. Since then, there hasbeen a steady but recently rapid improvement. 8The most probable explanation is that most maternal death autopsiesfrom this area are now conducted in one hospital mortuaryby a team of pathologists, with a noticeable increase in thequality as a consequence. The number of maternal deaths in the UK is small: Direct ,Indirect and Coincidental together total around 150 a year, so that experience inmaternal death pathology is difcult to attain. Conse-quently, having a small cadre of pathologists for eachregion or area in the UK who are prepared to undertakethis work to a high standard would be helpful. The Direct deaths covered all the major groups, but a noticeable feature was the increase in deaths from sepsis and, as noted in Chapter 2, fewer deaths from thromboem- bolism. The reports in 18 of the 75 deaths (24%) were con-sidered to be poor or worse, but there was a markedincrease to 61% in the good or excellent reports. Theremaining 14% of autopsies reviewed were considered ade-quate. Across the spectrum of the different disorders, mostof the poor autopsy reports were in deaths from pulmo-nary embolism (six of 14) and pre-eclampsia (six of 12). In the deaths from pulmonary embolism, the most common failings were a lack of clinico-pathological correlation andno search for the source of the emboli in four cases each.There were usually other deciencies present: in two therewas no mention of the body habitus in morbidly obeseindividuals, and there was even a totally inaccurate andmisleading clinical history given in one. Although not nec-essarily a criterion for assessing the quality of the report,Lucas, Millward-Sadler 182 \u00aa2011 Centre for BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203no histology was taken in any of those of poor quality. For example: A woman died of a massive pulmonary embolus with a his- tory of intermittent chest pains over a period of severalweeks and recurrent vomiting that had been diagnosed ashyperemesis. The autopsy report claimed a history of hyper-tension although her recorded systolic pressure was<110 mmHg. The source of the emboli was not identied,and there was no search for evidence of previous embolic episodes. Despite the history of hyperemesis, the brain was not examined, although it was claimed that the pituitarywas normal, and there was no clinico-pathological correla-tion or comment. In another report, the pathologist described the uterus and cervix in situ in the pelvis despite clinical data clearly stat-ing that the woman had had an emergency hysterectomy days earlier. The taking of histological samples has been contentious since the introduction of the Human Tissue Act . In this Report, there was no histology taken in 14 of 75 (19%) Direct deaths, suggesting that quality is adversely affected. However, analysis of the macroscopic descriptions showsthat, even without considering the desirability of histology,nine of these 14 cases were poor. The implication is thatthe Human Tissue Act is or can be used as an excuse fornot conducting an adequate autopsy.Maternal autopsies in the future? The medico-legal system for England and Wales and theprocess of death certication will change signicantly after the recent passing of the Coroner and Justice Act 2009 .I ti s likely that fewer deaths, including maternal deaths, will beaccepted for coronial autopsy, which is logical as most arenatural deaths, and in most cases there is a reasonableunderstanding of how and why the mother died. The intro-duction of Medical Examiners to scrutinise deaths willfacilitate this. And to replace those that may not have coro-ner-instigated examinations, clinical colleagues should request consented autopsies wherever possible. Where a co- ronial autopsy is needed, however, the body can be takenaway to a different area for more expert examination, andit is a recommendation that such centres of expertise bedeveloped nationally. Another development will be an enhanced role for imag- ing of cadavers, particularly with computed tomographyscans, to identify pathology related to cause of death. In maternal death, from the nature of the possible causes, this will probably have little impact outside consideration ofstroke, intracranial haemorrhage, aneurysm and (poten-tially) air embolism. Unresolved cases In the great majority of the maternal deaths where clinical and autopsy pathology information is available, there was Table 17.1.

However in a small number, the nal diagnosis and type could not be resolveddespite evaluation by many regional and central assessors in the different specialties. The problems lie in (1) inade- quate or inconclusive clinical data, (2) poor autopsy qual-ity, and (3) the intractable nature of some deaths. Table 17.1 highlights the main features of nine such cases, combining the clinical and pathological data. The possible diagnoses in these unresolved cases encompass all the types of maternal death, and theabsence of conclusive diagnoses biases the calculated rates of some important entities. The two most signicant of these are sepsis and sudden adult/arrythmic death syn-drome; the current report has identied an increase inthese clinical pathologies, so it is unfortunate that the truerates might be even higher if there had been better caseascertainment. Some deaths are never resolved at autopsy despite a full examination and ancillary tests. One reason is that a week or more of post-event intensive care can obliterate the pathological evidence of what that critical event was. Butthe main message from these deaths is that the maternalautopsy deserves a full protocol approach. This includessepsis screen, retaining blood for later tests (e.g. mast celltryptase to prove or exclude anaphylaxis), careful evalua-tion of the heart, full histopathology and, above all, think-ing about the possible range of clinico-pathological correlations.

In many cases, there may be a combined Direct +Indi- rect pathogenesis, and the deaths are multifactorial. Specic scenarios and important entities This is a summary aide memoire for pathologists encoun- tering certain potentially confusing clinical and pathologicalscenarios following a maternal death. 1 Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (dened as tonic- clonic inthe community between antenatal visits so brain, kid- ney and liver histopathology can be critical in making the diagnosis at autopsy 2 Sepsis This is complicated, and the previous tendency to includeall the scenarios under 'puerperal sepsis' oversimplies theissues of pathogenesis. A proportion of Group strepto-coccal sepsis is community-acquired infection via the respi- ratory tract, with pregnancy possibly making the infection more virulent. The following are the main clinico-patho-logical entities: a.Preterm spontaneous rupture of membranes andascending infection b.Direct infection of the genital tract during or shortlyafter the deliveryc.Nasopharyngeal tract (community-acquired) infection,with possible transfer vagina, ascend-ing infection and bacteraemia d.Necrotising fasciitis following a genital tract tear e.Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection acquired in hospital f.Sepsis from an organ not related directly to the genital tract, that is pneumonia, breast (mastitis), heart valveendocarditis 3 Intra-abdominal haemorrhage a.Uterine rupture b.Ectopic pregnancy c.Tear of an abdominal artery during or after cae-sarean section d.Ruptured aortic aneurysm or dissection e.Rupture of aneurysm f.Rupture of liver or spleen capsules g.Haemorrhage from liver in HELLP syndrome 4 Deaths related to anaesthesia e.Other anaesthetic complications such as anaphylaxis,hyperthermia 5 Termination of pregnancy a.Criminal (unsafe) abortion (i)Infection (ii) Air embolism (iii) Perforation of uterus b.Medical or surgical termination (i)Uterus rupture from prostaglandin induction (ii) Trauma to genital tract and perforation of uterus (iii) Infection and air embolism 6 Sudden unexpected cardiac death An area of growing concern where detailed depiction of theheart is essential 9,10 a.Sudden arrhythmic cardiac death (SADS) with mor-phologically in a hypertrophied heart (i)Cause of hypertrophy known\u2014that is hypertrophy (iii) cardiomyopathy') c.One b.Hypertensive and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203Annex 17.1.

Email: alison.miller@cmace.org.uk Background The UK Maternal Death Enquiry 2006-08 has been the responsibility of the Condential Enquiry into Maternaland Child Health (CEMACH) until 1 July 2009, followedby its successor organisation, the Centre for Maternal andChild Enquiries (CMACE), to completion. CMACE is a registered charity and company limited by guarantee governed by its own Board of Trustees. The Maternal Death Enquiry is part of the National Conden-tial Enquiry programme commissioned by the NationalPatient Safety Agency (NPSA) for England and Wales, theNorthern Ireland Department of Health and NHS QualityImprovement Scotland (NHSQIS) for their respective par-ticipation in the Enquiry. The Enquiry is carried out regionally through four CMACE ofces and two subcontracted ofces in England, the Public Health Agency team in Northern Ireland andthe Reproductive Health Programme team in Scotland. Thecentral coordination is carried out by the CMACE centralofce, which is based in London. Notication, surveillance and enquiry processes It is a government requirement that all maternal deaths should be subject to this Condential Enquiry, and allhealth professionals have a duty to provide the informationrequired. Additionally, the Clinical Negligence Scheme forTrusts (CNST) in England includes contribution to theenquiry within its criteria of standards. In participating in the Maternal Death Enquiry, profes- sionals concerned are asked for two things: 1To provide a full and accurate account of the circum- stances leading to the woman's death, with supportingrecords. 2To reflect on any clinical or other lessons that have been learned, either personally or as part of thewider context. The responsibility for initiating an enquiry into maternal death lies with the CMACE regional manager or lead within each ofce. Following a pregnancy-associated mater-nal death, a notication is usually made by one of thehealth professionals involved in the care of the woman tothe relevant CMACE regional manager. Cases are also reported by coroners, Local Supervising Authority Mid-wifery Ofcers (LSAMO) and others. This is followed upwith a request from the regional ofce for more detailedsurveillance data. The Enquiry is then initiated by the regional ofce using a standard data collection form (Maternal Death Report[MDR1] pro forma ), which is completed by obstetricians, anaesthetists, pathologists, GPs, midwives and any other professionals who were involved in the care of the woman.Copies of case notes are obtained, and where relevant,autopsy reports, internal reviews and, in some cases, addi-tional written statements are supplied. Each case is then prepared for a two-stage review and assessment process, the rst occurring at a regional level,and the second occurring at a central level. Regional assessment Each CMACE region has one or more sets of regionalassessors, depending on requirements. Each set includes anobstetric assessor, a midwifery assessor, a a perinatal psychiatry asses-sor. Nominations for medical assessors are sought from the presidents of the Royal Colleges, and nominations for mid- wives are sought from the LSAMO. Regional assessors must be an active clinical practitioner in the NHS, in the relevant specialty. If medical, the regio-nal assessor should be at consultant level, or, if a midwife,must be at supervisory or management level. The regionalassessors should have knowledge and experience of organi-sation of care, as well as commanding the respect of their peers. It is important that the regional assessor is able to realistically commit enough time to assess and returnenquiry forms in a timely manner. The role of the regional assessor is to review the infor- mation reported in the MDR1 form and any other docu-ments that have been assembled by the CMACE regionalmanager. Every attempt is made to obtain full details ofany autopsy and pathological investigations. Following collection of all the relevant information, the records are anonymised and circulated by the CMACEregional manager to regional assessors. The obstetric andmidwifery assessors review all cases. Anaesthesia and Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203Millerperinatal psychiatry assessors review all cases where there was involvement of an anaesthetic or intensive care or a his-tory of psychiatric illness, respectively. Cases where anautopsy has been obtained are assessed by the regionalpathology assessor. The assessors review the cases taking into account the case history, the results of pathological investigations and nd-ings of autopsy that may have been conducted. They thensummarise in a short report, which includes their commentsand opinions, regarding the cause or causes of death and theresources of the organisation responsible for the care of thewoman. The assessor is also asked to make a judgement as towhether the care was substandard and, if so, if this was a contributing factor in the death of the mother. The com- pleted form is then returned to the regional ofce. In Northern Ireland and Scotland, consensus case assess- ment is made and the report is written within a meeting ofthe regional assessors on a periodic basis within the trien-nium. Following regional assessment, the cases are sent from the regional ofce to the CMACE central ofce for central assessment. Central assessment The Director of the Maternal Death Enquiry reviews all cases and allocates the cases for central assessment asnecessary. The central assessors cover a broad range ofspecialties which include: obstetrics and gynaecology, midwifery, anaesthesia, psychiatry, obstetric medicine and cardiology, emergency medicine, general practice andpathology. The Director will make a decision as to whichare the most appropriate central assessors to review eachcase. The central assessors review cases and provide a central report, taking into account the regional assessors' reports.Following this detailed investigation, each case is allocated to a specic chapter in the nal report. All details regarding the death, including the agreed clinical cause of death, arerecorded in a database. In a small number of cases, the cause of death is assessed to vary from the underlying cause of death as given on thedeath certicate and classied by the registrars generalusing the International Classication of Diseases 10th revi-sion (ICD10). This is because a death may be coded for a specic cause of death, but the pathogenesis of this condi- tion may have been precipitated by an obstetric event. Forexample, although a given death may be coded as multiple-organ failure as the terminal event, it could have beenprecipitated by an obstetric event such as septicaemia froman infected caesarean section. Although each pregnancy-associated maternal death reported to this Enquiry is onlycounted once and assigned to one chapter, it may bereferred to in additional chapters. For example, a death assigned to 'hypertensive disorder of pregnancy', in whichhaemorrhage and anaesthesia also played a part, may bediscussed in all three chapters. Authors Chapters are initially drafted by individual central assessorsand then discussed in detail by the writing panel before thereport is nalised. Other acknowledged professionals, whohave a particular and expert interest in specic diseases orareas of practice, will be asked to provide peer review andcomment on the content and recommendations made in the chapter relevant to their expertise before publication. Statistical analysis and data presentation advice is pro- vided to each author by both an independent statisticaladvisor and data analysts at CMACE. These processes are summarised in Figure 1. Verication of ascertainment Ascertainment is checked with reference to data suppliedby the Ofce for National Statistics (ONS) for England andWales' data. These data are supplied in two forms: 1Direct notications \u2014these are deaths of women where 'pregnancy' is mentioned anywhere on the ONS deathregistration. These cases are coded as a maternal deathaccording to the ICD10. This identies all womenwhere pregnancy may have been a contributing factor to their death. 2Linkage notications \u2014these are deaths of women where the name of the woman appeared on the regis-tration of a birth in the current or preceding calendaryear. This allows for the identication of women whohave died up to 364 days following delivery. These data are cross-matched with the data that have been directly acquired by CMACE. Any cases that have been identied by one organisation but not the other would then be established. These outstanding cases are thenfurther investigated to ensure that they are pregnancy-asso-ciated deaths and warrant inclusion in the Enquiry. Theenquiry process is then initiated as above using the stan-dard data collection form. Condentiality All data and databases are held in accordance withCMACE information governance and security procedures(not applicable in Scotland). These ensure anonymity atdifferent stages of the Enquiry process, guarantee con-dentiality and safeguard any identiable information forthe duration it is held. These procedures meet with therequirements set out by Cabinet Ofce Guidance onAppendix 1: The method of Enquiry \u00aa2011 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 189managing information risk. In addition, the Maternal Death Enquiry has Section 251 approval from the National Information Governance Board (NIGB). This permits thecommon law duty of condentiality to be set aside sothat information that identies patients can be used with-out next-of-kin consent. After preparation of the Report and before its publica- tion, all maternal death report forms, related documentsand les relating to the period of the Report are destroyed, and all electronic data are irreversibly anonymised.Denominator data Denominator data and other relevant statistical data are supplied by organisations such as ONS, the Scotland Gen- eral Registrar Ofce (GRO), Northern Ireland Statistical Research Agency (NISRA) and Hospital Episode Statistics(HES).

Email: marian.knight@npeu.ox.ac.uk Surveillance of near-miss maternal morbidity The UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) was set up to study rare disorders of pregnancy1on a national basis throughout the UK. This has enabled serial surveillance ofa number of near-miss morbidities. It is increasingly beingrecognised that study of near-miss morbidity can comple-ment enquiries into maternal death and provide additional information to guide prevention and treatment of poten- tially life-threatening conditions. 2Maternal deaths represent the tip of the iceberg of disease; a much larger number ofwomen suffer from near-miss morbidity, increasing thepower of these studies to investigate risk factors both forthe occurrence of disease and progression to death or othersevere complications. This summary presents the key nd-ings from UK surveillance of near-miss maternal morbidi- ties and related conditions undertaken during the period of the maternal death surveillance of this report and describesongoing studies of near-miss conditions. Further details areavailable at www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/ukoss. Surveillance methods The UKOSS methods are described in detail in the Intro-duction to this Report. Each month, reporting cards with a tick-box list of conditions are sent to nominated reporting clinicians (midwives, obstetricians, risk management mid-wives and anaesthetists) in all consultant-led maternityunits in the UK. Inclusion of all consultant-led maternityunits enables UKOSS near-miss surveillance to cover theentire cohort of women giving birth in the UK, as womenwho experience these events at home or in a non-consul-tant unit will be transferred to a consultant unit. The sys- tem, however, does not allow for detailed surveillance of near-miss conditions occurring in early pregnancy, such asectopic pregnancy, when women will be cared for in gynae-cology units. Similarly, conditions which present later in the postnatal period, for example puerperal psychosis, are not surveyed, because presenting women are most likely tobe cared for in settings other than obstetric units. UKOSS is an active, negative surveillance system, that is, zero reports are sought in addition to reports of cases.Hence, all participating hospitals will return a report cardeach month, whether or not there have been any cases,enabling continual monitoring of response rates and conr- mation of the denominator number of women for the calcu- lation of disease incidence. In response to a report of a case,clinicians are sent a data collection form requesting furtherdetails of a woman's demographic, pregnancy and othercharacteristics, as well as management and pregnancy out-comes. All information collected is anonymous. In addition,for some studies, collaborating clinicians may be asked toprovide similar details for a comparison woman. This allows UKOSS to conduct case-control and cohort studies as well as descriptive studies and this considerably widens the rangeof research questions that can be addressed using the system. Examples of questions that can be addressed using UKOSS studies include: estimating disease incidence; for of eclampsia demonstrated a 45% reductionin incidence between 1992 and 2005 3 describing the prevalence of factors associated with near-miss maternal morbidity; for example a UKOSSstudy estimated that more than one in every 1200women delivering in the UK is extremely obese (bodymass index [BMI] 50 kg/m 2)4 showed a signicant associa- tion with previous delivery by caesarean section 5 auditing of national guidelines; for example UKOSS surveillance of antenatal pulmonary embolism showedthat very few women were not receiving thrombopro-phylaxis according to Royal College of Obstetriciansand Gynaecologists guidelines 6,7 *Head of the United Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System, National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit.Appendix 2A: Summary of United Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) Report on near-miss studies \u00aa2011 Centre 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 191investigating different management example the use of total versus subtotal hysterectomywas examined in the UKOSS study of peripartum hys-terectomy for severe haemorrhage, but no signicantdifferences in complication rates between the two techniques were found 8 describing the outcomes of severe morbidity; for example UKOSS surveillance of acute fatty liver ofpregnancy showed that both maternal and infant out-comes were better than suggested by previous hospi-tal-based historical studies 9 UKOSS can, in addition, be used to conduct studies rap- idly in response to emerging public health issues; hence, in response to the influenza A/H1N1v ('swine flu') pandemic, surveillance of women admitted to hospital with conrmedinfection was initiated to inform ongoing clinical guidanceduring the course of the pandemic. 10 Surveillance of specic near-miss morbidities\u2014key points fromcompleted UKOSS studies hysterectomy The incidence of peripartum hysterectomy in the UK is 4.1 cases per 10 000 maternities (95% CI 3.6-4.5) 0-1.5%). Peripartum is strongly associated with previous delivery by cae- sarean section (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.52, 95% CI 2.35-5.26), and the risk rises with increasing number ofprevious caesarean section deliveries (aOR 2.14 with oneprevious delivery, CI 1.37-3.33; 18.6 with two ormore, 95% CI 7.67-45.4)). Maternal age and parity are alsoimportant risk factors. 5 The majority of cases occur in association with either uterine atony or a morbidly adherent placenta (placenta ac- creta). The associated haemorrhage is managed in a variety of ways and not universally according to existing guide-lines; some women who have a hysterectomy for haemor-rhage caused solely by uterine atony are not fully treatedwith uterotonic drugs to control the haemorrhage. Veryfew women were reported to have had a hysterectomy fol-lowing treatment with some of the more innovative thera-pies for control of haemorrhage, including uterine artery embolisation and factor VII. 8However, this study did not collect information on women who had a postpartumhaemorrhage successfully controlled using these therapies,and therefore further surveillance was undertaken speci-cally to describe all women managed with specic second-line therapies to fully describe outcomes following their use(see below).Management with specic second-line therapies for postpartum haemorrhage Information was collected on all women in the UK man- aged with uterine compression sutures, pelvic vessel em-bolisation or ligation or factor VII for severe postpartum haemorrhage between September 2007 and March 2009. An estimated 2.6 women per 10 000 maternities weremanaged with these therapies. 11Almost a quarter of women subsequently underwent a hysterectomy followingfailure of control of the haemorrhage. Uterine compres-sion sutures were the most frequently used of these spe-cic second-line therapies; the compression sutures failedto control 29% of cases (95% CI 26- 36%). Treatment with uterine artery embolisation failed to control haemorrhage in 21% of cases (95% CI 6-46%), surgical ligation of pelvic vessels was performed ina very small number of cases and was associated with afailure rate of 68% (95% CI 43-87%) and factor VII,used in 12% of cases, unsuccessfully controlled for 71% of women (95% CI 52-85%). Womenwhose haemorrhage was not successfully controlled with a uterine compression suture were signicantly more likely to have had a later placement of the suture (more than2 hours following delivery) than women whose haemor-rhage was controlled (aOR 3.86, 95% CI 1.65-8.99), high-lighting the importance of early recognition andtreatment of postpartum haemorrhage to improve out-comes for women. Hypertension and related disorders Eclampsia The incidence of eclampsia has decreased signicantly inthe UK from 4.9 per 10 000 maternities in 1992 12to 2.7 cases per 10 000 maternities (95% CI 2.4-3.1)3in 2005. The majority of women in the UK are managed with mag-nesium sulphate according to national protocols, and com- parison between the 1992 and 2005 data suggest that maternal morbidity has been signicantly reduced as a con-sequence. No women in the study died (case fatality 0%,95% CI 0-1.7%). Fifty-four (26%) had recurrent ts.Twenty-two women (10%) were reported to have othersevere morbidity after the eclamptic episode. Outcomeswere known for 222 infants (204 singletons, 18 twins).Eight infants were stillborn, and ve died in the neonatal period (perinatal mortality 59 per 1000 births, 95% CI 32-98). This study showed the practical benets of theincorporation of research evidence into practice, improvingoutcomes for women through the widespread use ofevidence-based guidelines.Knight 192 \u00aa2011 Centre for BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203Acute fatty liver of pregnancy Nationally acute fatty liver of pregnancy is rare, with an estimated incidence of 5.0 cases per 100 000 maternities(95% CI 3.8-6.5/100 000) or 1 in 20 000 maternities. 9The 'Swansea' diagnostic criteria previously proposed agree sub- stantially with clinical diagnosis.13Eighteen percent of women had twin pregnancies, and 20% were underweight(BMI < 20 kg/m 2). This suggests that women with twin pregnancies appear to be at higher risk, but further studiesare needed to investigate the risk associated with low BMI.One woman out of 57 received a liver transplant. Onewoman died (case fatality rate 1.8%, 95% CI 0-9.4%).There were seven deaths among 67 infants (perinatal mor- tality rate 104 per 1000 births, 95% CI 43-203). The inci- dence estimate from this study is lower than documentedby earlier hospital-based studies, but maternal and neonataloutcomes are better than previously reported, possiblyrelated to improved ascertainment. Thrombosis and thromboembolism Antenatal pulmonary embolism A total of 143 women with antenatal pulmonary embolismwere reported, representing an estimated incidence of 1.3per 10 000 maternities (95% CI 1.1-1.5). 6There were a few cases where thromboprophylaxis was not provided accord-ing to national guidelines, and there may be scope for fur-ther work on guideline implementation. The main riskfactors for pulmonary embolism were multiparity 95% CI 1.09-6.45); however, without additionalstudies of cost-effectiveness, we are unable to recommendany changes to current guidelines which would aid preven-tion of this serious condition. Nearly a third of womenwith antenatal pulmonary embolism had no classical riskfactors, and only nine women with classical risk factorswere eligible for prophylaxis under 2007 guidelines. Further work is needed to assess how information about these risk factors may be used to guide prophylaxis. Two women hadrecurrent pulmonary emboli (1.4%, 1.1-8.0%).Hence, signicant severe morbidity maternal deaths from antenatal pul-monary embolism reported in the UK, with approximately30 women diagnosed with the condition for each woman who died. Amniotic fluid embolism Analysis of data reported over 4 years to UKOSS shows an estimated incidence of amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) of2.0 cases per 100 000 maternities (95% CI 1.5-2.5/100 000). 14Occurrence of AFE was signicantly with induction of labour (aOR 3.86, 95% CI 2.04-7.31)and multiple pregnancy (aOR 10.9, 95% CI 2.81-42.7); an increased risk was also noted in older women from ethnicminorities (aOR 9.85, 95% CI embolism(aOR (case fatality 20%, 95% CI 11-32%); ve of 37 infants of women with antenatal AFE died (perinatal mortality 135/1000 totalbirths, 95% CI 45-288). Women who died were signi-cantly more likely to be from ethnic minority groups (aOR11.8, 95% CI 1.40-99.5). In view of the extreme rarity ofthis condition and the signicant associated mortality, sur-veillance through UKOSS is ongoing to further investigaterisk factors and describe outcomes following the use of dif- ferent management techniques. Ongoing surveillance Ongoing surveillance of near-miss maternal morbidity is clearly important to complement the comprehensive studiesof maternal death as presented in this report. The followingstudies are ongoing (2010 onwards); additional studies willbe introduced as part of the UK National Maternal Near- miss Surveillance Programme funded by the National Insti- tute for Health Research. Uterine rupture Uterine rupture is associated with signicant maternaland fetal morbidity, and a decrease in the number ofwomen attempting vaginal birth after caesarean sectionmay be the result of concerns about the risk of uterine rupture. There are, however, no systematic data available at a population level to quantify the incidence of uterinerupture and to assess the risks associated with inductionand augmentation of labour in women who have had aprevious caesarean delivery. This study will investigate theincidence, risk factors and outcomes of uterine rupture inthe UK. Placenta accreta Placenta accreta is thought to be becoming more commonfor a number of reasons, including rising maternal age atdelivery and an increasing proportion of deliveries by cae-sarean section. There is at the same time a debate aboutthe optimal diagnostic and management techniques. Thisstudy will describe the current management of placenta ac-creta in the UK and associated outcomes for women and their infants. In addition, this study will estimate the national incidence of placenta accreta in the UK and iden-tify the extent to which previous caesarean section andolder maternal age are risk factors in this population. Thiswill enable appropriate future service planning, provideaccurate information, which can be used when counsellingwomen about the risks associated with caesarean sectionand developing management guidelines, and provide aAppendix 2A: Summary of United Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) Report on near-miss studies \u00aa2011 Centre Enquiries (CMACE), BJOG 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203 193baseline incidence against which future trends can be mon- itored if caesarean delivery rates continue to rise nationally. Antenatal stroke Stroke is an important cause of severe maternal morbidity and mortality in the UK. The increasing age of women at childbirth, along with other risk factors, may lead to anincrease in the incidence of stroke associated with preg-nancy. There have to date been no prospective nationalstudies to estimate the incidence or outcomes of this con-dition. This study will investigate the incidence, risk fac-tors, management and outcomes of stroke in pregnancy inthe UK to inform future guidelines for prevention and treatment. Myocardial infarction Myocardial infarction in pregnancy is known to be associ- ated with signicant maternal and fetal mortality. The cur-rent incidence estimate is based on a study from 1970.Current trends in lifestyle factors and increasing age atchildbirth are likely to be leading to an increase in inci- dence. This study will provide an estimate of the incidence of the disease, its epidemiology and its management. Pulmonary vascular disease Pulmonary vascular disease in pregnancy is widely consid-ered to pose an extreme risk of maternal death, but therehave been no recent prospective case series to assess thisrisk. Novel methods of management may also impact on outcomes. This study will provide a national picture of the incidence of the disease, its epidemiology and management. Aortic dissection Aortic dissection in pregnancy is a signicant cause ofmaternal morbidity and mortality. Changes in birth pat-terns, with a rise in older mothers and increased prevalenceof obesity, may contribute to an increased occurrence of aortic dissection in the UK. There have been no prospective studies to estimate the incidence of this disease and itsinvestigation and management during pregnancy. Thisstudy will estimate the national incidence of aortic dissec-tion in the pregnant population in the UK and use thesenational data to investigate and quantify risk factors foraortic dissection in pregnancy. Failed intubation Although anaesthetic-related maternal deaths havedecreased in number in recent years, hypoxia related tofailed intubation remains a consistent cause of mortality.The incidence of failed intubation in the obstetric popula-tion is thought to be higher than in the nonpregnant popu-lation, but the reasons for this higher incidence in theobstetric population are thought to be multiple. This studywill investigate the incidence, risk factors, management and outcomes of failed intubation in the obstetric populationin the UK to inform future guidelines for prevention andtreatment. Conclusions National studies of near-miss maternal morbidity con-ducted through UKOSS provide a range of information tocomplement the national Condential Enquiries intoMaternal Death contained in this report. The UKOSSnetwork of collaborating clinicians in all consultant-ledmaternity units allows for ongoing surveillance of specic near-miss conditions as well as rapidly responsive studies where there is an urgent public-health need. The UK Con-dential Enquiries into Maternal Death are cited worldwidefor their role in improving maternity care and pregnancyoutcomes for women, and the model has been adopted inmany countries. In a similar manner, the UKOSS model isnow being adopted internationally 15,16with the potential for multinational collaborative surveillance studies giving added benet to women and their families.

Email: Christopher.lennox@nhs.net Background and methods Since 2003, following a successful pilot,1a continuous audit of severe maternal morbidity in Scotland has been con-ducted, collecting data on consistently dened events in allconsultant-led maternity units in Scotland. The includedevents and their denitions are based on pilot work by Man-tel et al. 2The audit is administered by the Reproductive Health Programme of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS), and an annual report is produced. The reportfor 2008 3includes denitions of events, a detailed descrip- tion of the methodology, an analysis of trends over the6 years of the audit to date and web links to previous annualreports. The main ndings for the triennium 2006-08 arepresented here, with reference to earlier years where appro-priate. It can be downloaded from www.nhshealthquali- ty.org/nhsqis/les/SCASMM_REP_APR10.pdf. In each consultant-led maternity unit, a designated mid- wife coordinator noties the NHS QIS Reproductive HealthProgramme of all women meeting one or more of thesevere morbidity denitions. Minimum data are collectedfor all categories of morbidity, and detailed information isrecorded for cases of major obstetric haemorrhage and ofeclampsia, including a detailed within-unit assessment of the quality of care. No named patient data are submitted to NHS QIS. Rates of morbidity in this summary are calculated from birth statistics published by the General Register Ofce forScotland 4and include all live births and stillbirths. Stan- dards of care are derived from guidelines 5,6 Results During the triennium 2006-08, 1025 the condential audit, experiencing a total of1237 morbidities. The rate of severe maternal morbiditywas 5.88 per 1000 births (95% CI 5.52-6.25) based on174 430 births in Scotland. 4Most women (832) had a single morbidity, but 177 suffered two, 12 had three and four women had four identied morbidities. In the sametime period, there were 13 Direct and Indirect maternal deaths in Scotland, giving a mortality/morbidity ratio of 1in 79. The ratio in the previous triennium was 1 in 56.The distribution of reported morbidities in each categoryis shown in Table 1. Since the audit commenced in 2003, the rate of reported morbidity has varied from a low of 4.50 per 1000 births(95% CI 3.96-5.09) in 2004 to a high of 6.25 per 1000 births (95% CI 5.63-6.94) in 2006. Almost all of this variation has been the result of changes in the reported rate of majorobstetric haemorrhage (MOH), which has always been themost frequent cause of morbidity. The combined rates of allother causes reported to the audit have changed little overthe years ( Figure 1). An apparent rise in the rate of MOH in the middle of the decade appears to have halted. An analysis of intensive-care unit (ICU) admissions was not carried out until 2008. In that year, only 29 (8%) women were admitted to ICU for reasons not otherwisewithin the audit criteria. The most frequent reason overallfor ICU admission was for MOH (47% of ICU admis-sions, 16% of all cases of MOH), and the most frequent'uncategorised' reason for admission was for a cardiaccondition, both congenital and acquired (12% of ICUadmissions). The perinatal mortality rate among women suffering severe morbidity is high. In 2006-08, the rate was 57.2 per1000 births (95% CI 41.7-77.0) compared with a perinatalmortality rate of 7.6 per 1000 (95% CI 7.2-8.0) for allbirths in Scotland in the same period. 7 The most frequent cause of MOH is uterine atony (46.9% of all cases of MOH in 2006-08). Although theincidence of a morbidly adherent placenta as a cause is rel- atively low (40 cases, 5.5% of MOH in 2006-08), the audit conrmed its association with a previous caesarean section.Also conrmed was the association between MOH and cae-sarean section delivery: 44.3% of cases of MOH were deliv-ered by emergency caesarean section, rising to 55.2% whenelective caesarean sections are included. In 2006-08 inScotland, the overall emergency caesarean section rate was16%, rising to 26% when all caesarean sections were included. 8One in ve (21.8%) emergency caesareanLennox 196 118(Suppl. 1), 1-203sections resulting in MOH were performed at full dilata- tion. The proportion of all emergency caesarean sections in Scotland performed at full dilatation is unknown but it isalmost certainly lower than this. The surgical management of MOH has undergone a sig- nicant change since the audit commenced in 2003, with asteady increase in conservative surgical techniques. Intra-uterine balloon tamponade was used in only six cases in2003, but this rose steadily to 53 (21% of all women with MOH) in 2008. The use of uterine brace sutures similarly increased from 10 in 2003 to 25 in 2007. This has beenassociated with a statistically signicant decline in the peri-partum hysterectomy rate ( P= 0.032), as shown in Figure 2. The overall standard of care for both MOH and eclamp- sia in 2006-08 was high, with most units complying withover 90% of auditable standards taken from current guide-lines. 5,6Units' self assessments found, however, that care was entirely optimal in only 65% of cases of MOH and inonly 48% of cases of eclampsia. Major occurred (17 women, eclampsia cases (four women). Prob- lems identied included lack of senior medical involvement (especially for eclampsia) and delayed recognition of theserious nature of the problem. Discussion The Scottish Condential Audit of Severe Maternal Mor-bidity has provided information and assessments of the quality of care for six continuous years. The technique of prospective collection and notication of a wide range ofmorbidities with case assessment by unit-based staff andanalysis by a single national body appears unique. Otheraudits of maternal morbidity have been time or locationlimited, dependent on nationally collected information orinvolved certain specic morbidities. The subject is bedev-illed by a lack of consistent denitions and by difculties with case identication and comprehensive data collection. Although, for example, all studies have found that MOH isthe most common cause of morbidity, there is no uniformagreement on the amount of estimated blood loss thatshould be considered 'major', and the Scottish inclusioncriterion of loss of 2500 ml or more is higher than moststudies. Using consistent denitions and methods over a number of years, however, encourages reliable reporting and allows an analysis of trends. Most of the variation from year toyear in the rate of morbidity has been as a result of fluctu-ations in reported MOH. This appeared to be rising everyyear until a gradual reduction in the past 2 years. In thelight of reported rising rates of all postpartum haemorrhagein the western world, 9including Scotland (Chalmers J, personal communication), the recent decline in MOH is encouraging and suggests that prevention of MOH may be proving effective. On the other hand, the reported declinein eclampsia in the UK as a whole 10has not been seen in Scotland, although the numbers remain small.Table 1.

All of the women studied in this audit survived episodes of severe morbidity, and it is, therefore, unsurprising thattheir care was, in general, good. Although major subopti-mal care of cases of MOH was uncommon, minor or inci- dental problems were frequent, occurring in over one-third of cases. Even units caring for 1000 births per year canexpect four or ve episodes of MOH annually. Practicedrills including education in the recognition of risk factorsmay help, and the early involvement of senior medical staffwhen MOH is anticipated (for example where placenta ac-creta is suspected or emergency caesarean section at fulldilatation is performed) or occurs should be encouraged. Direct consultant involvement in the immediate care of women experiencing eclampsia was particularly lacking.With a mean of only 16 cases annually of eclampsia inScotland in 2006-08, some units may see no cases for sev-eral years. This is reflected in the reported failure to recog-nise prodromal signs and symptoms. Despite thesereported deciencies, the severe morbidity/maternal mortal-ity ratio in Scotland in 2006-08 improved to 1/79 from 1/ 56 in 2003-05, although the small numbers of maternal deaths make it difcult to form rm conclusions. In addi-tion, although there were two deaths from MOH in Scot-land in 2006, there were none in 2007 or 2008, and nodeaths from eclampsia occurred in the triennium. Thevalue of measuring morbidity and its care is clear.
