We now are in the Era of Psychobiology and Biophysics, and it is widely accepted that our body can affect our mind, and our mind can affect our physical body. Today, meditation is considered a type of mind-body-soul complementary/integrative medicine. It is a treasure for us and for our world and, as such, I believe it should be part of any base educational curriculum. Meditation is part of many different ancient spiritual systems (Holistic Health). Its origin is probably from Tantra (approximately 5000 years ago), which refers to scriptures pertaining to esoteric traditions rooted in Hindu and Buddhist philosophy. Those ancient traditions were passed from teachers/mentors/gurus to disciples/students as life-learning experience. We can find meditation traditions in different spiritual systems and/or religions. Amazing technological advances have allowed medicine and science to progress and improve quality of life. In spite of this, something seems missing: there is an increased demand in our society for a different vision of life, one that is less materialistic and more compassionate. We are human beings, but most of us live like \"human doings\". People are outwardly focused from morning until night. This causes stress and can, over time, compromise health. Shouldn't health and illness prevention be a priority in our lives? Meditation can take us in that direction. I believe human beings and their surroundings are expressions of different forms of energy (see Book Ref.s #1), with their own specific vibration (frequency=f). The relation between the energy of a photon and its frequency can be expressed by the famous formula E=Plank's constant x f and the frequency of electromagnetic waves can be written as following f=velocity/wavelength. Interestingly enough, modern physics string theory (see Book Ref.s #2), where everything is a form of energy in more than three dimensions, and ancient Buddhist principles seem to have more in common than we could have imagined. The world seems to be a perception of our mind and the quantum entanglement seems to be part of our world as well. Energy channels and points (see Book Ref.s #2) are part of our \"invisible or subtle\" body. You too might have experienced the feeling of different energy fields around you at some time in your life, but the point is that we are not used to pay attention to it. It takes practice to go back to our original nature, and to connect again with our deeper natural/instinctual feelings (see Book Ref.s #1). This concept is shared by several cultures where spiritual energies take different names, for example Chi/Qi in the Chinese tradition, Ki in the Japanese tradition, and Prana/Kundalini/vital life energy in Yoga. The meridians and acupuncture points in TCM, are related to the Nadis and Chakras in Yoga (see Book Ref.s #2). How good are the observations in our materialistic world? It depends on our five senses or how good the instruments used by the observer are. We have an anatomical nervous system that is not physiologically designed to perceive everything or every dimension in our environment, as it can process only information from a limited part of reality. Indeed, our five senses can only perceive a small part of the physical reality: for example our eyes are limited in the range of electromagnetic frequencies they can see, and so are our ears when it comes to sound (similarly, other animals have different ranges of perception). What are the actual space and time boundaries of the Universe? How do particles acquire a mass? Is the new Higgs-Boson theory trying to answer this never-ending question? Can we try to widen the reach of our limited sensorial perception? My belief is that the practice of meditation (see Book Ref.s #1), along with an open and curious mind, can help us to reach this goal. This might encompass various spiritual systems and techniques aimed at similar goals, such as enlightenment in Buddhism, or union with the divine and higher consciousness in Yoga (see Book Ref.s #1). Finally, I am convinced that, by bringing forth the best of each individual's soul and consciousness, meditation techniques and the practice of compassion can serve the dual role of improving the quality of life for both the individual (Integrative and Preventive Medicine), and society at large (Healthier Environment and Public Safety).
