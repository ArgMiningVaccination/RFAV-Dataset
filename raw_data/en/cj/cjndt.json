Both of these practices are designed to correct imbalances with the body structural and supportive systems as well as prompt natural healing which leads to optimum health. These practices have a long history of helping patients improve their overall quality of life and overcoming physical difficulties. Why Should You Use Chiropractic and Acupuncture as a Dual Treatment? Rather than using these treatments sequentially, using chiropractic and acupuncture as a dual modality treatment allows you to get the greatest benefit at one time. Chiropractic works to correct subluxations based within the nervous system by using targeted manual adjustments to the spine. This treatment allows the central nervous system to send messages throughout the body to promote healing. On the other hand, acupuncture works to remove blockages that may interfere with the body's internal balance. By using these treatments as a dual treatment, they work together to remove all blockages from your body which improves energy flow, speeds up healing, and promotes balance in the body. Using these techniques together may be the most efficient form of treatment available to you. What Conditions Chiropractic and Acupuncture Treat? When our bodies are out of balance and our natural ability to heal is disrupted, disease takes root. Acupuncture and chiropractic can be used together to treat almost any condition that they are used to treat alone, including: - Neck pain - Headache - Lower back pain - Sports injury - Arthritis - Sciatica - Insomnia - Chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or allergies If you have any questions about how chiropractic and acupuncture work together to promote healing, make an appointment with our Naperville Chiropractor, Dr. Timothy Erickson, for a consultation. Dr. Erickson would be happy to discuss these treatments with you and how they may help you. Please Contact Symmetry Chiropractic & Acupuncture at 630-984-5503 for more information.
