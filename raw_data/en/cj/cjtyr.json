If you need further support, please reach out to the Dean of Students office at [deanofstudents@keene.edu](mailto:deanofstudents@keene.edu). The Wellness Center is unable to provide documentation of illness unless you are seen. Isolation is hard. What can I do to support my mental health while in isolation? College can be hard and isolation can be an added stressor. While you are in isolation, try some of the following to reduce stress: - Meditation and Yoga- there are many online resources (Youtube alone has a ton, such as the very popular Yoga with Adriene) , and the following apps can connect you with 1000's of guided meditations or yoga: - Insight Timer (free!! With access to thousands of guided meditations, music, and yoga) - Headspace - Calm - Breathe2Relax (also free! With guidance to breathing meditation) - Stay connected: reach out to friends and family. Text, call, message, video chat, whatever way you like to communicate! Connect with others daily. - Rest: take time to nap, read books, color, draw. Enjoy the opportunity to take it easy! - Gentle activity: if you are feeling up to it, some gentle movement can help reduce stress while in isolation. Take breaks every hour to get up and walk around. - Dance! This is a great way to move a little, release tension and feel better. Put on your favorite tunes and get moving! - Get outside: If you are isolating at home and can be away from others, take some time for short walks or even just sitting outside can help one feel better. If you need more support for your mental health, please do not hesitate to reach out to the counselors at the Wellness Center by calling 603-358-2200.
