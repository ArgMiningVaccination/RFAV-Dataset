Just before Halloween, Frankie stayed home from school with a bit of a head cold - nothing serious. But within a cou - ple of days, Frankie was having trouble breathing and was rushed to the hospital. From there it was a whirlwind of terrifying events - a spinal tap, a heartbreaking diagnosis, and then an iron lung. The claustrophobic feeling of being caged in an 84-inch tube and being paralyzed, un- able t o breat he, must have been t errify- ing for the seven-year-old. Frankie' s terror would be short-lived because he would never leave the iron lung. Sixty-one hours after admission to the hospital, Frankie died from polio. The evening of Frankie' s burial, Janice was also diag- nosed with polio. She survived but had to learn to walk again. The heartbreaking epilogue to this story is that six months after Frankie 's death, the first polio vaccine trial would take place. Only 17 months after Frankie' s death, the polio vaccine was available in the U.S. While it saved millions of lives, it came too late for Frankie 's family . Frankie' s twin, Janice, now a wife, mothe r, grandmothe r, and polio survivo r, still misses her brothe r. We've had a safe and e ffective vaccine to prevent polio for almost 70 years, and we are on the brink of eradicating polio from the face of the earth due t o vaccines. Yet, Janic e feels she c annot celebrat e, \"As more and more parents question the necessity and safety of vaccina - -Introduction: Why this matters Page 5waves and the Internet), I must confess that I am worried.\"1 Most of us have never seen polio and frankly don't really worry about it. This is the double-edged sword of vaccines; they work so well t hat people forget vaccine-preventable diseases are dangerous and still a threat. We could replace Janice 's story with one about meningitis, whooping cough, common denominator is that these diseases still threaten our children. And this is why we all need to be active advocates for vaccines. Because these dangerous diseases didn't go awa y. Vaccines keep them awa y. If we stop vaccinating, they will come back. That' s not speculation - that is a certainty . And the way we keep them away is to be vocal vaccine champions. To vaccines. And to quash dangerous misinformation so it can't harm those we love. That' s what this toolkit does: provides you with the facts and tools to start We have long t aken vaccines for grant ed. If we do not start being v ocal about our support for them, the diseases vaccines prevent will again begin to rob children like Frankie Flood of a future. We know keeping a child safe starts with parents but includes all of us. So that 's why we're focused on families. Because whether you're a mom, a grandparent, auntie, family friend - we all have a role and a job to do in keeping the children we love safe! 1 Based on Janice Flood Nichols ' story told to the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia. Watch Janice tell her story: I Am a Polio Survivor The V accine Makers ProjectPage 6Too frequent ly we hear dangerous disinf ormat ion like t he diseas es that vaccines prevent aren't that serious. So we think it 's to take a moment to provide some numbers to disabuse people of this dangerous myth. Here are the facts: Vaccines prevent 4-5 million deaths every year! That means that vaccines save a population equivalent to all of Los Ange - les. EVER Y. YEAR. (source: WHO) Vaccines helped reduce measles deaths 2008).

Roald Dahl, author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and James and the Giant Peach, on the last conversation he had with his daughter Olivia who Page 7Vaccines are so commonplace today that we sometimes forget the awesomeness that is immunization. Fear not, we are going to give you the lowdown on the history of vaccines. Most of us think about vaccines as a 20th Century science but it' s been around for thousands of years. Did you know that variolation was recorded as early as the 11th Century in China. The Egyptians were using variolation to protect people by the 13th Century and West and North Africa started More than 100 years of science Immunization, as we know it, is more than 100 years old. Louis Pastue r, the grand- father of microbiology , also created the prevent a disease called chicken cholera. But it was Edward Jenner who really advanced how we thought about vaccines. Jenner realized that exposure to cowpox (a virus similar smallpox but not serious) could protect someone from getting smallpox. During Jenne r's of the population. History: A short but spectacular history of vaccines Variola tion used a small- pox scab from an infected person to help pr otect other s from smallpo x. This w as the ear liest f orm of imm uniza tion. Thankfully oday's vac- cines ar e much saf er and mor e effectiv e than variola tion. Page 8Successes that r ocked our world! Almost 150 years after Jenne r's discovery , vaccines have changed the world as we know it including: Eradicating smallpox from the face of the earth. Smallpox was killing people as early as 1100 BC and remained a fright - years before it was eradic ated, smallpox k illed an estiamt ed 300 million people. Thanks to the smallpox vaccine, smallpox is no longer a threa t! Decreasing the number of children who die before their 5th birthday . In 2015 researchers looked at 149 national level health surveys that included 1 million children from 62 countries to see if vaccines reduced childhood death. What they found is one of the strongest cases f or vaccines: when the children in a community are fully vaccinated, that community Preventing deadly diseases, EVEN cancer! We often talk about the advances that medicine has made in treating cancer but what about preventing it altogether? Did you know that there are vaccines that do just that? The HPV vaccine targets high-risk human papillomavirus strains that are responsible for almost all cervical cancers and linked to some throat, anal, and other cancers. Hepatitis B vaccines help prevent infections that lead to liver cance r. Some parents are reluctant to give their child a vaccine for a sexually transmitted infection so young. But the vaccine works best when given before someone is sexually active, specifically between 11 - 13 years old. Page 9Many people have questions about how v accines are developed. This more and more t rue as emergency va ccines c ome on the market. Here' s what you need t o know about vaccine development . Vaccine Development Vaccine development is a closely monitored and rigorous process. All vaccines, even accelerated vaccines, must adhere to all the safety and ethical protocols. Important things to know about vaccine development: Vaccines have been studied for more than 100 years. Vaccine development is NO T started from scratch - it builds on a strong foun - dation of what is already known to work and be safe Scientists understand short and long term side ef fects because: in several weeks of vaccination Most long term side e ffects are found in ~45 days of vaccination Vaccines are literally the most researched and monitored health interventions in med - - tiveness in preventing dangerous diseases AND their safety . Vaccine Overview: Development & Safety Lorem ipsumPage 10Vaccine Ef fectiveness Vaccines have single handedly saved billions of lives. Need proof? Consider measles, one of the most conta - gious disease on earth. Measles is so contagious that if one person with measles is in a room with 10 unvaccinated people, 9 of them will get sick. Before the vaccine, in the US alone, there were between 3 and 4 million cases of measles each year.. In 2019, there were over 200,000 deaths from measles worldwide in areas with low vaccine rates. The good news? The measles vaccine works! When children get both measles. The bad news? The U.S. actually eliminated measles in 2000 but because of vaccine hesitanc y, cases have been increasing year by yea r. During the US 2018-19 measles outbreak, there were over 1,200 cases across 31 states. Most cases were in people who were not vacinated. Measles is not the only disease that can be brought under control by vac - later COVID-19 made t he world stand still. As of August 2021, 203 million people in the world have gotten COVID-19 - but vaccines are on the scene and as more people get va ccinat ed, fewer are dying from COVID . Did you know ... Vaccines prevented at least 10 million deaths between 2010 and 2015 and save about 42,000 lives in the U.S. every year . I'm super effective! Page 11Vaccine Safety Vaccines are some of the most researched medical interventions on earth. We have been researching vaccines for more than 100 years. And billions of children have been safely protected from serious diseases in that 100 years. By the time a vaccine is approved and is at your doctor or pharmacy it has gone through a rigorous process to make sure it works and is safe. This includes: Clinical Trial Data: There are usually thousands of people enrolled in clinical trials so there is a LO T of data focused COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. FDA Review and Liscen sure / Emerg ency Use Authorization: If a vaccine is found to be safe and e ffective during the clinical development phase, it is reviewed by the Food and Drug Ad- ministration (FDA) for use in the general public. The FDA will outweigh any risks. Almost every country in the world has an equivalent to the United State 's FDA, which means vaccine data are reviewed by dozens of regulatory bodies around the world for safety and ef fectiveness. ACIP Review and Guidance: Once a vaccine is licensed and approved for use, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviews all the data and provides guidance on how a vaccine should be used. Page 12family advocac y. We think of family advocacy as human-t o-human, personal engagement. It' s not abstract, sta tistics-driv en data but real v oices with real stories working to help real people make the best choic es to keep our c hildren safe. You don't need t o be a vaccine expert (we have scient ists and public health professionals f or that). You just need t o be part of a family and want th e best for all families. When t hinking about advocating for vaccines, remember t hat there are a lot of ways to do it. So if one does n't seem like your c up of tea, you c an still be an effective advoc ate another way. The four main types of family-based advocacy are: Peer-to-Peer Community- Based Online Legis lator Education Let's take a brief look at how t o make each work f or you. Peer-to-Peer This is probably the most common f orm of advoc acy. It's essentially just a con- easy because we talk with each other all the time. And hard because conver- sations with people who are hesitant about vaccines can be tricky. But Peer-t o- Peer advocacy is crucial because it provides a trustwort hy place for people with questions about vaccines to talk about them with someone t hey trust. Types of family advocacy Page 13But some helpful hints can make these conversations much easier and much more effective. Some t hings to remember ... Don't let the perfect b e the enemy o f the good. Yes, you are going t o make mista kes. You might be frustrat ed or worried you've misstepped. It' s What you think of as \"convincing\" can seem like \" coercion\" to the other person. So tread lightly. Listen c arefully, Assure people you are not trying t o make their decisions for t hem but are trying to give them accurat e informat ion to help t hem make t heir own decisions. Encourag e questions! Many people f eel like they are not \"allowed\" t o ask questions because \"the scienc e is settled. \" And while t he scienc e is settled about va ccines, it doesn't mean we can ask questions t o better understand it. Behaviors change attitudes faster than attitudes change behaviors. People make unconscious decisions to trust us (or not) based on how we say somet hing, more t han what we say. So be a role model f or trustwort hy behav ior. Listen - no serious ly, really listen. You're having a conversation, not giving a speec h. Be informed and s upport ive. Be an ally. It's a journey, not a destination. Not every vacc ine-hesit ant person is a refuser - in f act, most are not. They have quest ions t hat need answers and that can t ake time. Conv ersat ions about va ccines are not a \"one and done. \" It takes time, so be patient, have realisti c expecta tions, and don't push t oo hard. Page 14How to frame the conversation When t alking with a vaccine-hesit ant person, here' s our \"4-A Approach.\" This approach helps families f eel respect ed and heard, and empowers them to make positive health decisions Four steps. Easy to remember . Winner winne r, chicken dinner! Here it is your main concern?\" their hesitanc y.\"What is the thing that concerns you most...can you tell me more about it?\" ACKNOWLEDGE: Recognize that the person you're talking to already knows. \"It' s clear you've really looked into this.\" AFFIRM: Make sure people k now t hat it's ok to have questions. \"That' s a great question, I heard that too so I looked into it.\" ANSWER: Get permission to share some facts. \"Can I share with you the facts...\" O R \"Can I get you some credible sourc es so your researc h helps you make an in- formed decision.\"Page 15Community-based Community-bas ed advocacy is a great type of advocacy for people who are natural networkers and are involved in, or want to be better c onnected t o, their c ommunit y. While P eer-to-Peer advocacy is about that personal connection, commu - nity-bas ed advocacy is about creat ing and reinforcing social norms. Com- munity-bas ed advocacy normaliz es vaccination by ensuring it is positively presented in all aspects of a communit y. And it import antly ensures t hat th e majority of us (because most of us do support va ccinat ion) have the loudes t voices. So how t o be effective at Community-bas ed advocacy? Here are s ome great activities: Ensure y our library has c redible v accine books. Work with your library to create a vaccine highlight table Work with your school and P TA on vaccine educ ation Ask community groups t o host va ccine-relat ed events, partners may be: 4H: This is a natural partner because v accination is very import ant in animal husbandry Faith-bas ed organizat ions: Another natural becaus e most fait h leaders believe spiritual and physical health are tied together. And protecting their congre - gants is part of their job. Rotary Parent groups or neighborhood organiz ations Write an O pEd for your local paper Volunteer with your state or local immunizat ion coalit ion Coordinat e an \"ask the expert \" table during back to school nights clinic f or their employ ees Engaging community partners Most community partners are willing to support ac - community at large. Ask for things that are easy to say yes to: A Girl Scout Science Badge that focuses on vaccination A talk with 4H clubs that draw parallels between keeping herds and humans healthy through vaccination Messages in bulletins and newsletters of places of worship on the importance of the Page 16Online Social media. Ugh. Unfortunately, this is where a lot of the \"convers ations\" happen. They can be challenging and f rustrating because s omet imes all the rules around polite discourse seem t o go down t he tubes. Bu t there are things you c an do. Join pro-v ax groups to be informed about the f acts as well as connect with other like-minded people Post pro-v ax memes/ Report misinformat ion Some t hings to remember about online engagement . - whether it's trolling or bullying. Don't fall down t he rabbit hole: Some anti-vaxxers will continue t o try to engage y ou with no intention of have meaningf ul dialogue. Don't . If someone is so far down t he anti-vax rabbit hole, you're not going t o change t heir mind, espec ially online. Polit ely bow out. Legislator Educ ation Learn to be compelling storytellers! Being a storyteller involves both art and science. And we've all seen the di fference between a great sto - ryteller and a mediocre presente r. Look in the V oicesForV accines.org resources section for some great storytelling tools and trainings, and resources. Our resource section also has s ome t ools t o help y ou write letters to your legislators and local news outlets. Page 17The r ole of storytelling in advocacy Show don' t tell! Storytelling is critically important in talking with people about things like vaccines. That' s for a number of reasons: Most of us are not scientists so we don't connect with the data. In fact, sometimes the data can be confusing or even scary We are emotional beings - our decision-making is based on the heart and the head. W e need stories to help our emotional decision-making process It helps people relate. It's personal. It' s real. It' s not a bunc h of numbers Frankly , it's just more interesting Storytelling best practices Tailor it to your audience: what will resonate most with them Identify the purpose of the story: what is the message you want to get across Describe what happened instead of explaining the main lesson Keep it short and focused Make it personal: use your own experiences Use emotion and empathy Don't be the hero of the story (\"and then I saved the day...\") Practice!Page 18Common social media \"debate\" tactics It's important to correct false information, whether it 's in a conversation or online. But with social media, the e ffort can feel daunting because anti-vaxxers use a variety of tactics to frustrate you so they can have the last word. Here are some common social media \"debate\" tactics and how to address them: Appeal to emotion: Emotions can often be seen in a logical argu - ment, but often we will see arguments without logic trying to overcome this weakness by making people feel fea r, hatred, or revulsion. Acknowledge the emotion but circle back to the facts: I understand that hearing such things is frightening. We need to make sure we rely on facts, not emotions. Here are the facts. Special pleading (moving the goalposts): What does a person do when their claim is proven wrong? They claim that their actual claim was dif ferent or that there is a special exception for their claim. The goals will keep moving as you prove the other person incorrect. I noticed that you have changed the topic. Before we move on, can we please come to some sort of agreement about the earlier topic? Burden of proof: Here, a person making a claim will ask you to prove them wrong. But that' s not how it works. If you make the claim, then you'd better bring the proof. I know it is frustrating to be doubted, but if you make this claim, you should expect that you will need t o provide the facts to support your claim. Please provide your evidence. Advocacy on Social Media Page 19 Black-or-white thinking: In this world of thinking, there are only two options. Howeve r, truth has many shades. So just because vaccines safe. Use common activities to help people better understand risk. \"It 's true, vaccines are not 100% safe, but nothing is. You are more likely to choke to death eating than suffer a serious adverse event from a vac - cine. Yet we all still eat. W e need to understand the real risk of things to be able to make informed decisions. Anecdotal argument: An anecdotal argument is really a study with only one test subject and no peer revie w. The stories people tell need to be supported by what we know about science, or they should likely be dismissed. I appreciate this story is emotional, but we need to rely on facts when making decisions. In this case, the facts do not support that this story could have happened the way it has been told. Here are the facts. Page 20 Texas sharpshooter (cherry-picking): This logical fallacy starts with a conclusion and then picks the evidence to try to support it. that supports it. I noticed that some of your evidence supports your beliefs, but when we look at evidence, we need to consider all of the evidence, not just the pieces we think support our beliefs. When experts look at all the studies and take into account their strengths and weaknesses, their conclusion is very different. In-group bias: People are often biased toward those they see as part of their group. Accepting arguments from our in-group, without critically evaluating, can lead to incorrect thinking. It's true that the strongest predictor of whether or not we vaccinate is the number of people around us who vaccinate. I put my trust in experts who, instead, rely on facts and evidence. Here are their con - clusions on this topic. Belief bias: This bias begins with what you already believe and ac - cepts anything that supports that belief without taking a good, critical look at the evidence. Can I ask you to do a thought experiment? If you were arguing the opposite point of vie w, what would you say to someone? Page 21 Often, when people are shown evidence that their deeply held beliefs are incorrect, rather than accepting the new evi - dence, they hold onto their old beliefs even harde r. Because of this bias, it' s best to try to help people reach correct conclusions on their own. I see that you have done a lot of searching on this topic, and I agree with you on this point. How do you think scientists go from that point to supporting vaccination in this case? The Dunning-Kruger effect: The more you kno w, the more you know you don't know as much as you thought you kne w. In other words, peo - than they should be. I respect that you have done a lot of reading in this area. Can you respect that the experts have done considerably more study and re - search and I trust their statements over yours?Page 22 Gish Gallop: In this argument, someone will throw everything and the kitchen sink and the neighbo r's sink at you. It 's a list of arguments so long that you would have no way of addressing them all. So don't. Ask the person to focus on one argument and discuss that. I see that you have laid out more points that I could reasonably answer at this time. What is your one biggest concern that you'd like to discuss with me? False Balance: This fallacy gives equal weight to the opinions of ex - perts and complete amateurs. Most often seen in journalism, it gives equal time and weight to two people whose knowledge is not at all equal. Similarl y, it might also overemphasize an opinion held by a tee - ny, tiny minority of people. It's important that we not give equal weight to an expert and a non-ex - pert as though science were a matter of debate. Please stick to the facts and do not give voice to non-expert extremists. The shill gambit: This argument assumes that the opponent is only making their arguments because they are paid to do so. This conversation is not about employment or personalities, but about facts and evidence. Let 's please return to discussing those. Just Asking Questions: This tactic works to instill uncertainty by ask - ing a lot of troubling questions. A person using this tactic is not looking for answers, but trying to make people feel doubtful about what they thought they knew . It sounds as though you have many questions. Which of these ques - tions is the most important to you? Can you tell me more about why that question concerns you? Page 23 Appeal to nature: This fallacy assumes that what is natural is best, even though all sorts of natural things try to kill us. I understand that it is comforting to rely on nature over science, but the truth of the matter is that vaccination is a combination of both. Vaccines dangerous in nature. Appeal to conspiracy theory: This fallacy relies on people 's sense of powerlessness by reinforcing the idea that a nefarious group is out to get them. It 's notable that large conspiracies are always outed fairly quickl y. See: W atergate. and monitored by many sources, including governments all over the world, universities, and non-government organizations.Page 24A word of warning, there very often is no reaching someone who is so far down the rabbit hole. They will switch from one tactic to the next as you quash them. You need to decide if you want to engage in what could be - come a \"whack-a-mole\" online debate. Some guidance if you do want to engage: Be polite...to a point. If someone is bullying, it 's okay to call them out and to report them on social media. If someone is of fensive, you should call them on it. Some anti-vaxxers have equated some pro-vaccine people to Nazis. If something like this them know in no uncertain terms that equating genocide and vaccines is insensitive to victims of the Holocust, ill-informed, and outrageous. Use we, not me or I. Generally speaking, regardless of what you're talking about or who you're talking to (business associates, friends, or online) this approach is bette r. It's more inclusive, assumes buy-in on certain things, and doesn't seem like you are presuming you are the end all, be all. We don't have to agree but let 's agree to keep this polite. We all want what 's best for our children... Don't escalate, don't engage. Regardless of what someone says, don't sink to their level. Call them on their behavior (politely) and disengage. Know when enough is enough. Porloning the conversation may ultimately be harmful as it provides more opportunities for the sharing of misinformation. Page 25Let people know you are done. Oftentimes if you just disengage, the person will sa y, \"see, they had no come back so they left. Just shows you I'm right.\" So before you disengage, say so. \"This isn't productive so I'm not continuing this conversation any longe r, but if you do want credible information in the future, please let me kno w. Report mis-, dis-, and malinformation. Studies show that Facebook has a great amount of mis-, dis, and malinfor - mation but all social media is susceptible. And all platforms have the ability for you to report it. The only way we are going to get a handle on false infor - mation is to report it when you see it. Look for the 3 dots in the upper right or report post\" or \"report tweet\" depending upon if you are using Facebook or Twitter . It's ok, to disengage politely saying, \"I'm sorry you're not in a place to learn the facts. But if things change in the future and you want credible information, please know I am for you.\" And leave it at that.
