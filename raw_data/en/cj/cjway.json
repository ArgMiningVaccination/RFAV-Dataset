Enter with a mindset for conversation, not debate. Research it. Sometimes the risk outweighs the benefits. A lot of those diseases have gone away due to improved hygiene and clean water supplies. Look at what some of the vaccines are made of and cultured in. I don't think those things were ever intended to be directly in our blood streams. What disease do you naturally catch directly into your blood stream? Doesn't mean they don't work, sometimes they do. But for some people, the question is: \"At what cost?\" A child before 2 years of age, before the immune system is fully developed, is subjected to 46 different vaccines (diseases), many at the same time when we have never researched how these things interact with each other, how can you expect there not to be any side effects at all? That's putting a lot of trust in flawed and incomplete human thinking. A delayed vaccination schedule and informed consent would be good places to start in regards to this issue. "}
