With immunity of everyone's lips lately, we're sure you'll be happy to know that acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) are very beneficial in assisting immune function. While focusing on hand hygiene and coughing/sneezing etiquette is extremely important, having a strong immune system and a healthy lifestyle shouldn't be underestimated. If you feel your immune system could use some support, we offer a range of acupuncture and TCM treatments and can help you to understand where there may be gaps in your overall health. Your immune system according to TCM Picture your body as a town. Your digestive system is the farmers, your liver and gall bladder are the generals, your heart is in charge and your pericardium is their advisor. Your kidneys are the doctors, and your bladder and colon are the cleaners. All of your organs have an important role to play in keeping your body functioning optimally. Then you have your lungs. They are in charge of distributing Qi (your energy) through your body. In the town analogy, they are in charge of the town's wealth and ensuring the town has strong defences to protect its money. In your body, these defences are your skin, your body hair, your immunity and the defensive Wei Qi, which battle pathogens and keep your body's borders safe. If you breathe clean air, exercise regularly and have balanced emotions, you are more likely to have a healthy immunity. You are also less likely to allow pathogens to enter your body. However, if start getting a runny nose, chills and fever, etc, this is a sign that they have passed the first wall. How to strengthen your lungs There are many things you can do to keep your lungs and immune system strong to prevent falling ill or recover quickly if you do happen to fall ill: - - Exercise daily Move, dance, walk, run or play for half an hour every day - Breathe clean air Get out in nature and sit among the trees - Breathe deeply Use your tummy muscles to draw each breath deep inside - Eat more fresh fruits and veggies Particularly white veggies like cauliflower, parsnips, turnips and swedes - Eat pungent spices Curry and cardamom are great options - Get acupuncture regularly It helps to reduce stress and inflammation, which weaken your immunity.
