Our primary mission remains to provide outstanding care for the patients for whom we are privileged to serve. But, in addition, we have developed strong programs in research and education. Indeed, we are increasingly recognized not only for clinical care, but also as one of the leading academic Departments of Surgery in the nation. The Department consists of 10 Divisions led by distinguished Division Chiefs who are recognized leaders in their respective fields. As demonstated in the accompanying graphs, our outpatient clinic volume has continued to increase steadily. Although our surgical volume has plateaued over the past three years, this reflects the increasingly complex nature of surgical cases being performed. Indeed, we continue to pioneer innovative minimally invasive surgical proce-dures, including in the past year trans- apically delivered mitral valve replacement and hypoglossal nerve implantation for the treatment of sleep apnea. We closely monitor and strive to contin - ually improve care through our Quality and Safety Initative led by John Howington, MD. Among other significant accomplishments, Chairman's Letter Mark Talamonti, MD Chairman of Surgery, Stanton and Margaret Rogers Palmer Chair of Surgery Comprised of 10 Divisions, the NorthShore Department of Surgery is supported by a strong team of Vice Chairs and administrative leadership, all focused on four pillars of excellence: research, education, quality improvement and patients' clinical experience. this initiative has resulted in both our hospi- tal readmission and surgical site infection rates decreasing significantly over the past five years. In 2015, we launched a new Surgical Outcomes Research Program lead by Katharine Yao, MD, through which we are analyzing and comparing our surgical outcomes to those reported in national health databases. Dr. Yao works with a team of our surgeons, surgical research fellows and biostatisticians to analyze treatment outcomes, identify areas for improvement, and design and implement clinical trials to enhance patient care. Our Departmental research encom - passes broad clinical and translational research initiatives. All of our clinical research is facilitated, supported and overseen by our Surgical Research Office (SRO). The SRO is led by Agnes Brugger, RN, who supervises a dedicated team of 30 nurses, research managers and research coordinators located in our core and nine satellite research offices. Our number of clinical trials has nearly tripled over the past eight years; currently, our Department has more than 150 active clinical studies, many of which have resulted in improved patient care and significant academic productivity. Our translational research focuses on our new Program for Personalized Cancer Care (PPCC). This genomic-based program is led by Charles Brendler, MD, Vice Chairman of Surgery and Executive Director of the PPCC. The PPCC is com-posed of five cores led by distinguished scientists who have recently been recruited to NorthShore University HealthSystem (NorthShore), including Jianfeng Xu, MD, DrPH, Director of Cancer Genomics; Simon Hayward, PhD, Director of Cancer Biology; Yuan Ji, PhD, Director of Computational Genomics and Medicine; Susan Crawford, DO, Director of Experimental Pathology and Imaging; and Chi-Hsiung Wang, Director of Biostatistics. All of these scientists have their faculty appointments through the Department of Surgery, and they and other Departmental investigators had 15 external grants funded in 2015. The Department also has become a recognized leader in surgical education. University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine surgical trainees consistently rate NorthShore as their top educational experience, and our faculty continue to be recognized for their teaching contributions, with seven awarded individual recognition by the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine in 2015. Our educa-tional initiatives are led by Nancy Schindler, MD, MHPE, Vice Chairman of Surgery and the E. Stephen Kurtides, MD, Chair of Medical Education, who oversees and coordinates all of our postgraduate educa-tional programs. Dr. Schindler also recently developed a Faculty Mentoring Initiative and works individually and tirelessly with our NorthShore surgical faculty members to help guide their career development and academic promotion. The Grainger Center for Simulation and Innovation (GCSI), led by Michael Ujiki, MD, has become recognized as one of the leading surgical simulation centers in the nation. The GCSI has implemented a comprehensive surgical skills curriculum, and its numerous training courses all attract a large number of attendees from across the United States and Canada who almost universally rate their experiences as outstanding.

Grainger Center for Simulation and Innovation One of the country's leading surgical simulation training centers, the Grainger Center for Simulation and Innovation (GCSI), led by Michael Ujiki, MD, continues to offer a broad range of educational programs attracting a growing number of students and physicians. A fully implemented curriculum for surgery residents has been exceptionally well- received by both residents and faculty. A postgraduate two-week full-time rotation incorporates pretesting for surgical skills, mentoring and teaching by NorthShore faculty, and post-testing to measure improvement in specific surgical skills. Surgical residents report that simulator time is extremely valuable, and research has shown that simulation skills improve performance in the operating room. Curricula for medical students and physician assistant students include fundamentals such as basic laparoscopic camera holding and suturing skills. Every University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine resident practices weekly in the simulation lab. Advanced surgical training programs in 2015 included two peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) courses. NorthShore was an early adapt-er of this innovative procedure. Dr Ujiki, a recognized expert in minimally invasive technique, was joined by POEM originator Haruhiro Inoue, MD, as instructors for the sold-out session that drew physicians from across the country and Canada. NorthShore was one of three labs in the country to host training on the advanced trauma procedure resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA). The GCSI also serves as a destination site for industry testing of new surgical instruments and design. changing and increasingly competitive healthcare environment. We must strive to continually improve clinical care through quality initiatives, outcomes analyses, and clinical and translational research, and we must continue to share our discoveries with our colleagues and maintain our dedication to educating future surgeons. We look for-ward to the year ahead and the opportunity to build on our tradition of excellence. The Grainger Center for Simulation and Innovation attracts students and physicians from around the country for a growing number of innovative training programs.Surgery residents continue to praise the skills training at the Grainger Center for Simulation and Innovation as an incredibly valuable resource critical to their education and developing expertise.2 NorthShore University HealthSystem Medical GroupProgram for Personalized Cancer Care Over the past year, we have recruited a team of distinguished scien- tists and support staff, and purchased scientific equipment needed to perform complex genomic analyses. We have launched clinical trials for personalized cancer care in prostate cancer, as well as in breast and colorectal cancer, and we have begun to commercialize our proprietary genomic tests with the goal of making these tests widely available to the public. We recently opened a personalized prostate health clinic that provides genomic-based prostate cancer risk assessment and care. Preliminary data have formed the basis of 14 federal grants submitted over the past year, four of which have already been funded. We have entered into scientific collaborations with major medical institutions, including Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm and Fudan University in Shanghai, and we have shared our discoveries with the international scientific community through 75 publications.Unique Approach Our approach to cancer care for prostate (as well as other cancers) differs from other medical institutions that are primarily focused on late-stage disease and the analysis of the genetic changes in an individual patient's cancer (somatic) DNA to deter-mine the most effective chemotherapy. In contrast, our program is based fundamentally on the genetic pattern of an individual's hereditary (genomic) DNA to derive a personalized cancer risk assessment profile. Based on the inherited risk of developing a given cancer, individualized preventive screening and diagnostic cancer care strategies can be implemented; and, for individuals who develop cancer, analysis of both genomic and somatic DNA alterations can help identify optimal treatment. Thus, as shown in figure 1 below, rather than focusing only on advanced cancers, our approach encompasses the entire spectrum of cancer care. Genetic Risk Score Our unique approach is made possible by our proprietary genetic risk score (GRS), a panel of genetic alterations specific for each type of cancer that has been developed and validated by our scientific team. The GRS supplements family history, which can be helpful but is often unknown or incomplete in assessing inherited risk of disease. Because the GRS is based on hereditary genomic DNA that does not change over an individual's lifetime, the GRS needs to be done only once and can be performed on a small sample of blood or saliva. The panel of genetic alterations used to calculate the GRS varies with the type of cancer and can be applied to assess an individual's risk of developing many types of cancers. Genetic risk scores can be determined for multiple cancers, as shown in figure 2 to the left in a hypothetical male patient. With the average population risk of developing a given cancer being 1.0, this individual has an average or below average hereditary risk for eight cancers (blue bars) and an increased risk for six differ-ent cancers (red bars), with the highest risk being for developing lung cancer. Knowledge of inherited risk early in life could be very impactful and beneficial; for example, a 30-year-old man with an increased inherited risk for lung cancer might be further motivated to quit smoking. Conversely, a woman with a low GRS for breast cancer might not need to undergo mammography as early in life or as often as usually recommended in \"one size fits all\" cancer screening guidelines.

Hospitals and physicians will soon be held accountable for clinical outcomes of their patients in a more transparent and stringent way than in the past. In line with efforts to provide high-quality care, the Department of Surgery has formed the Surgical Outcomes Research Program (SORP) co-directed by Katharine Yao, MD, and Mihir Bhayani, MD. A multidisciplinary program of surgeons, research fellows and statisticians, SORP performs clinical outcomes research on large national databases to examine trends in surgical care, compliance with national guidelines, and clinical trials and survival outcomes. We are currently working with the National Cancer Data Base, the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, and the Surveillance Epidemiology End Results (SEER) and SEER Medicare databases. Surgeons work closely with research fellows who are recent college graduates, along with surgical residents and fellows, to develop research ideas, query the databases and analyze the data. Biostatisticians from the NorthShore Research Institute work directly with the research fellows and surgeons to perform trend and survival analyses. The outcomes of these studies help inform future clinical trial design involving surgical procedures and identify gaps in compliance with accepted clinical guidelines. Our intention is for hospitals and physicians to use our findings to improve the care they provide patients and ultimately the quality of care across the country. Faculty Mentoring Initiative Recognizing the importance of mentoring in faculty growth and development, a new Faculty Mentoring Initiative, led by Nancy Schindler, MD, MHPE, the E. Stephen Kurtides, MD, Chair of Medical Education, was established in 2015. Throughout the year, our Division Chiefs met individually with each of their respective faculty members to provide mentorship and help develop specific career goals. As part of the new process, each Surgical Outcomes Research Program Dr. Nancy Schindler, pictured here with Dr. Seth Krantz, leads the new Faculty Mentoring Initiative, designed to help each member of the Department reach personal goals related to clinical success and leadership development.faculty member set three personal goals, which were aligned with Department goals for clinical success, leadership development, and research and education. Ongoing mentoring focused on individual development required to achieve specific goals. The Department achieved 100 percent participation, a major success for a new initiative and a reflection of the shared belief in the importance of mentoring. In coming years, Dr. Schindler will continue to work with our Division Chiefs to further develop and expand this major initiative. Quality and Safety Initiatives The Department of Surgery works with a \"Patient First\" imperative that follows a long-standing culture focused on quality and patient safety. As the Director of Surgical Quality, John Howington, MD, leads a program that has served as a model for other departments across NorthShore and includes a fully engaged team that participates in formal peer-review of actual cases. As one of 12 sites nationally that participated in the ProvenCare Lung Cancer Collaborative, NorthShore held itself accountable and adhered to 38 best-practice indicators associated with improved outcomes for surgical treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. In the last three years, NorthShore went from 60 percent to 90 percent adherence and decreased its median length of hospital stay to 2.0 days, which is significantly below a national expected stay of 4.3 days. NorthShore also participates in the Illinois Surgical Quality Improvement Collaborative, which uses national quality improve-ment data and benchmarks that allow hospitals to compare outcomes and use data to drive quality improvement efforts. Among the many quality improvements NorthShore has demon- strated in recent years is a decrease in surgical site infection from 1.2 percent in 2011 to its current level of 0.45 percent. A steady decline in hospital readmission rate within 30 days is another quality marker in which the Department of Surgery has significantly improved from 11.7 percent in 2011 to 10 percent in 2015. 4 NorthShore University HealthSystem Medical GroupSurgical Research and Clinical Trials Surgical Research The Surgical Research Office supports members of the Department of Surgery in research endeavors with staff trained and certified in clinical research.

Our group\u2014consisting of statisticians, bioinformaticians and computer scientists\u2014focuses on the development of computational methods, software tools\u2014and resources for big-data and precision medicine. Our research concen - trates on three major areas of translational genomic cancer research: 1) We have developed a comprehensive information system of cancer genomic interactions, named Zodiac. Zodiac presents a whole- genome molecular interaction landscape of cancer by performing massive big-data computation on the most comprehensive cancer genomics database yet developed, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We have analyzed about 200 million gene pairs in the genome and produced a large database and search engine, publically available atcompgenome.org/zodiac. Zodiac provides in-depth and vertical knowledge about functional interactions between molecular entities such as DNA and RNA in the whole genome. It is expected to help identify novel drug targets and support real-time clinical care. 2) Cancer development is an evolutionary process generating multiple subclones of cells marked by distinct somatic mutations. Traditional one-size-fits-all types of cancer treatments ignore the subclonal structure of cancers and cannot effectively kill all the tumor subclones. Understanding the genetic landscape of tumor subclones is crucial in successful cancer treatment. Using next-generation sequencing data, we are now able to develop computational methods and tools to identify the signals of individual subclones and reveal subclone- specific mutation profiles. Our work has recently been featured in many press releases, such as the Science Daily News: (sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/08/150809170251.htm). 3) Our group is a leader in developing novel designs for cancer clinical trials. We host a next-generation dose-finding design at compgenome.org/NGDF, which has now attracted pharmaceutical companies and cancer research institutions worldwide to design their trials. We also lead the field in finding subgroups in the patient popu - lation, another important and challenging problem in personalized precision medicine. Experimental Pathology and Imaging Core Susan Crawford, DO, Director The goal of this core is to provide to the PPCC and other investigators pathology- and histology-related services, including pathological analy - sis of human and murine tissue, immunohistochemical staining and microdissection of tumor tissue from biopsy samples. In addition, we analyze histological and cytological samples using various imaging modalities such as immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. In 2015, the core facility has participated in the following projects: Cancer and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Biology Principal Investigators: Simon Hayward, PhD, and Omar Franco, MD, PhD, NorthShore Research Institute 1) Expression of androgen receptor variant (ARV) in human prostate samples 2) Stromal and inflammatory changes in a murine model of prostate cancer 3) Pathological evaluation of human samples of BPH for a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded studyTranslational Research Our goal is to bring together a multidisciplinary group of scientists focusing on early-stage prostate cancer (PCa) development and to facilitate the discovery of new treatments. Recent evidence supports the concept that the large majority of patients with early-stage PCa would be best served by avoiding surgery with its associated complica - tions. However, other than active surveillance (AS), we currently lack nonsurgical alternatives to offer patients. Due to the understandable concern over silent disease progression to an incurable stage, the decision to enter an AS program can be exceptionally difficult. PCa is composed of cancer cells and a cast of supporting actors including immune/inflammatory cells, nerves, muscle cells and a collection of connective tissue cells known as fibroblasts. This complex milieu is known as the tumor microenvironment and is a major focus of research. Increasing our understanding of the PCa microenvironment will have significant implications for the management of PCa and other cancers. Normal organs engage in continuous crosstalk between their component tissues to maintain a stable and tumor-free state. In cancer, the \"volume\" of this crosstalk increases. Over the past few years, many new drugs that target the molecules involved in this communication afford us novel approaches to bring this \"noise level\" down. Our goal is to develop medical approaches to stabilize low-volume PCa with mini - mal side effects, such that patients will be comfortable participating in AS and be able to lead healthy lives without undergoing major surgery. Cancer Genomics Core Jianfeng Xu, MD, DrPH, Director We have established a strong team of scientists in genomic translational medicine by recruiting experienced investigators with expertise in DNA sequencing and genotyping (S. Lilly Zheng, MD, and Jishan Sun, PhD), tumor genomics (Wennuan Liu, PhD), genetic epidemiology and evi - dence-based outcomes research (Deke Jiang, PhD, and Yung Na, MD), and research coordination (Carly Conran, BS, and Hannah Eck, BS). This team is critical to implementing the pyramid model of personalized cancer care, the centerpiece of the NorthShore PPCC (see figure 1, page 2). In 2015, our major accomplishments include:1) Developed and optimized a proprietary genetic risk score (GRS) that can be used clinically for genetic risk assessment of various types of cancer 2) Using our GRS, initiated the first clinical trial in the country for genomic-based targeted cancer screening for prostate, breast and colorectal cancer 3) Developed and optimized a proprietary genetic test for measuring tumor DNA copy number alterations in prostate biopsy samples to predict disease progression in AS patients 4) Initiated genomic studies in prostate, breast, pancreatic, colorectal and thyroid cancer 5) Published more than 25 peer-reviewed papersNorthShore focuses its scientific inquiry on the direct improvement of clinical care and patient outcomes. Our physicians, scientists and researchers have built our reputation on this translational approach to research. The Department of Surgery actively participates in a variety of important research studies involving several major cancers, which are highlighted below. Cancer Biology Core Simon Hayward, PhD, DirectorDepartment of Surgery 2015 Annual Report 7 Principal Investigators: Vadim Bachman, PhD, (Northwestern University) and Charles Brendler, MD1) Assist in pathological assessment of tissue in an NIH-funded study which aims to apply an innovative optical imaging technique, partial wave spectroscopy (PWS), to assist in risk stratification of patients with low-grade prostate cancer enrolled in an active surveillance program 2) Provide lectures and training to Dr. Bachman's biomedical engineer Principal Investigator: Prem Seth, PhD Provide histological evaluation for a murine model of breast cancer and metastases and assess immunohistochemical stains Principal Investigator: Joshua Meeks, MD, PhD, Northwestern University Provide histological assessment of a murine model of bladder cancer Principal Investigators: Wennuan Liu, PhD, and Jianfeng Xu, MD, DrPH Micro-dissect prostate cancer biopsy samples for a study evaluating PTEN and MYC DNA copy number alterations to assist in risk stratifica - tion of patients with low-grade prostate cancer Biostatistics Core Chi-Hsiung Wang, PhD, Director The Biostatistics Core facilitates the PPCC by supporting both clinical and translational research. This core oversees data quality assurance and provides advice and guidance on protocol design, sample size calculation, data analyses, and any other aspects of statistical consulta - tion related to specific PPCC study aims. The group has a great deal of expertise and experience in conducting complex clinical trials and has served as co-investigators for many inter - nally and externally funded studies employing a large range of innovative and advanced statistical methodologies. Recent research involves developing predictive models for personalized cancer care by using big data from our institutional electronic data warehouse, regional public health data and national cancer registries. We are developing statistical algorithms to improve the odds that a certain treatment will result in a favorable outcome for an individual cancer patient. The ultimate goal is to develop a multilevel statistical model that can predict the most advantageous personalized cancer care strategy for all patients. Using high-confidence statistical algorithms, we will be able to predict actionable treatments or interventions to better improve long-term health outcomes Individual PPCC Initiatives Breast Cancer (BCa) Principal Investigator: Katharine Yao, MD Collaborators: Catherine Pesce, MD, Jianfeng Xu, MD, DrPH, and S. Lilly Zheng, MD1) Personalized Screening for BCa: To address a controversial issue, we are launching a combined retrospective and prospective study that will help determine at what age individual women should start screening mammography. These studies will use our unique and proprietary genetic risk score (GRS) to risk-stratify women and allow us to develop personalized screening strategies, rather than the current \"one size fits all\" screening guidelines. 2) Genomic Risk Factors for Contralateral BCa: Women often choose to undergo bilateral mastectomy because they overestimate their risk of developing cancer in the other breast. However, few studies have examined the genetic risk factors for contralateral BCa. We are using recently discovered contralateral BCa risk genes to provide individualized risk assessment and personalized care recommendations. Head and Neck Cancer (H&NCa) Principal Investigator: Mihir Bhayani, MD Collaborators: Project 1\u2014Wennuan Liu, PhD, and Bruce Brockstein, MD Project 2\u2014Yitan Zhu, PhD, Yuan Ji, PhD, and Omar Franco, MD, PhD Project 3\u2014 Bruce Brockstein, MD, and Chi-Hsiung Wang, PhD 1) Genomic Profile of Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC): The total number of new cSCC cases outnumbers all other cancers combined. Although most patients are surgically cured, a small but significant percentage of patients develop and eventually succumb to recurrent disease. Our objective is to use advanced sequencing technologies to create a risk profile predictive of cSCC aggressive behavior and to implement earlier adjuvant treatment. 2) MicroRNA Dysregulation in H&NCa: To improve survival in patients with non-human papilloma virus (HPV)-related H&NCa, we are employing a computational approach using genomic data from tumor tissue by interrogating The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Using these computational models, we have identified miRNA signatures that predict for poor prognosis. Our goal is to assess the functional effects of these miRNAs and their subsequent therapeutic potential in H&NCa. 3) Outcomes Research: We are participating in the Surgical Outcomes Research Program and investigating national cancer regis - tries to identify disparities in presentation and treatment of H&NCa. These studies have resulted in numerous presentations at national meetings. We also have begun an analysis of the effectiveness of post-treatment imaging in H&NCa surveillance using the NorthShore Enterprise Data Warehouse to address the cost-effectiveness of imaging in these patients. Prostate Cancer (PCa) Principal Investigators: Projects 1 and 2\u2014Brian Helfand, MD, PhD, and Jianfeng Xu, MD, DrPH Project 3\u2014Simon Hayward, PhD Collaborators: Projects 1 and 2\u2014Deke Jiang, PhD, Yung Na, MD, and S. Lilly Zheng, MD Project 3\u2014Omar Franco, MD, PhD 1) Addressing PCa Screening Controversy: The recent controversy over prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening has resulted in fewer men undergoing PSA screening and being diagnosed with PCa. While decreased PSA screening has undoubtedly spared many men with non-life-threatening PCa unnecessary treatment, it is likely that men who harbor potentially lethal prostate cancer may escape early diagnosis and subsequently die of their disease. We have developed a smarter screening approach based on inherited PCa risk to identify which men are likely to develop aggressive PCa and, therefore, stand to benefit the most from PSA screening and subsequent diagnosis and treatment. 2) Distinguishing Indolent from Aggressive PCa: While most prostate cancers are non-life-threatening, others are rapidly progressive and fatal. In collaboration with Johns Hopkins University, we have recently analyzed genomic DNA from the blood of 96 men who died of PCa. We found that 20 percent of these men share a panel of inherited genetic alterations that are only rarely found in men with non-life-threatening PCa. We are now analyzing blood from 1,000 additional PCa patients to confirm this finding. In a second collaboration with Johns Hopkins University, we have identified two major chromosomal abnormalities that are predictive of To learn more about ongoing inquiry and discovery at NorthShore, please visit northshore.org/research continued8 NorthShore University HealthSystem Medical GroupPCa mortality. These two studies have significant implications for men with PCa; if men harbor either the lethal gene panel or one or both of these two chromosomal abnormalities, we would recommend that they be treated immediately following diagnosis. 3) Stabilization of PCa \u2014Our cancer biologists are developing a novel strategy to stabilize early PCa. Typically, to prevent a cancer from growing, a patient is treated with high-dose chemotherapy. While this treatment may slow the growth of the cancer, it often results in serious side effects. Our approach (see figure below) is to use a combination of nontoxic biological agents in low doses to stabilize early PCa and prevent it from growing, producing minimal, if any, side effects.Translational Research Gene Therapy Program Principal Investigator: Prem Seth, PhD Collaborators: Yuefeng Yang, Weidong Xu and Charles Brendler, MD Systemic Delivery of an Oncolytic Adenovirus Expressing Decorin for the Treatment of Breast Cancer (BCa) Bone Metastases There is an urgent need to develop novel therapies for BCa bone metastases. We have constructed an oncolytic adenovirus Ad.dcn a nonreplicating adenovirus Ad(E1-).dcn, both containing human decorin gene. Our in-vitro studies showed that Ad.dcn produced high levels of viral replication and decorin protein in BCa cells. Ad(E1-).dcn-mediated decorin expression in MDA-MB-231 down-regulated of Met, -catenin and vascular endo - thelial growth factor A, all of which are recognized decorin targets and play pivotal roles in the progression of BCa growth and metastasis. Adenoviral-mediated decorin expression inhibited cell migration and induced mitochondrial autophagy in MDA-MB-231 cells. Mice bearing MDA-MB-231-luc skeletal metastases were systemically administered the viral vectors, and skeletal tumor growth was moni - tored over time. The results of bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and X-ray radiography indicated that Ad.dcn and Ad(E1-).dcn significantly inhibited the progression of bone metastases. At the terminal time point, histomorphometric analysis, micro-computed tomography and bone destruction biomarkers showed that Ad.dcn and Ad(E1-).dcn reduced tumor burden and inhibited bone destruction. A nonreplicating adenovirus Ad(E1-).luc expressing luciferase 2 gene had no significant effect on inhibiting bone metastases, and, in several assays, Ad.dcn and Ad(E1-).dcn were better than Ad.luc, a replicating virus expressing the luciferase 2 gene. Our data suggest that adenoviral replication coupled with decorin expression could produce effective antitumor responses in an MDA-MB-231 bone metastasis model of BCa. Thus, Ad.dcn could potentially be developed as a candidate gene therapy vector for treating BCa bone metastases.

The program and patients are supported by our shared Nurse Navigator Gail Ronkoske, BSN, OCN. The thoracic research teams also meet weekly to review local and national clinical trials as well as investigator-initiated studies. Illinois Surgical Quality Improvement Collaborative: Dr. Howington serves as the Surgeon Champion for NorthShore in this collaborative that consists of more than 40 leading Illinois hospitals working together to improve quality and safety and lower costs of surgical care. The objective is to obtain rapid, meaningful and sustained improvement in surgical quality by facilitating engagement in mentored and targeted quality improvement and performance improvement initiatives. Thoracic Tumor Data Registry and Biorepository: These resources contain clinical data for more than 3,000 subjects and 960 thoracic tumor samples. In 2015, NorthShore collaborated with the University of Chicago and West Virginia University on two studies: Fifty non-small cell lung cancer tissue samples were stratified in the patient cohort. This pilot study was completed in 2014, and a larger cohort of 100 samples were analyzed in 2015. As part of The Chicago Thoracic Oncology Database Consortium (CTODC), which was created to standardize data collection and facilitate the pooling and sharing of data at institutions throughout Chicago and across the world, we shared de-identified data with the University of Chicago from lung cancer patients treated with Tarceva. A resulting manuscript was submitted for publication to BMJ Open.Division of Thoracic Surgery Thoracic Surgical Oncology Structured Clinical Documentation System (SCDS) Project: After successfully implementing an SCDS clinical note, the thoracic team worked with the SCDS team at our Center for Biomedical Research Informatics to develop distinct structured operative notes for lung cancers, esophageal cancers and thymic tumors. Ki Wan Kim, MD, is the physician leader in SCDS devel- opment for our Division. Teaching and Educational Highlights The Division of Thoracic Surgery, in collaboration with the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine Thoracic Surgery fellowship program, helped train fellows Diego Avella Patino, MD, and Brian Mitzman, MD. With the assistance of our three certified Physician Assistants (PA-C) Amy Call, Kaitlin Bryzinski and Alison Glinski, the Division also helped train Physician Assistant students from Rush University Medical Center and Rosalind Franklin University. Our two summer premedical undergraduate research interns, Zari Watts from the University of Chicago and Kendall Elue from Hampton University, presented individual quality improve-ment projects at our annual Thoracic Oncology Research Conference. This summer internship and our research efforts are well-supported by our Research Coordinator, Ujala Bokhary, MBBS.

Collaboration with biomedical engineering students from Northwestern University in con-junction with the Grainger Center for Simulation and Innovation (GCSI) at Evanston Hospital con-tinues. We are developing innovative products to be used in trauma and acute care surgery. The aim is to develop working prototypes that can be submitted for Internal Review Board approval and tested at our NorthShore hospitals. The trauma team has been trained on a new technique for traumatic non-compressible hemorrhagic shock called REBOA (Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occulsion of the Aorta). Honors, Awards and Academic Recognition Dr. Agos contributed to book chapters in the Atlas of Clinical Emergency Medicine on cervical and lumbar spine fractures. He was recognized by Gift of Hope as a Lifesaving Partner, and he has been named a member of the Critical Care Advisory Committee for Gift of Hope. Dr. Ortega has participated as an instructor in this year's Advanced Trauma Life Support course hosted at the GCSI, and attended the annual Trauma/Acute Care Surgery meeting in Las Vegas. Philip Theodoropoulos, MD, has shifted his clinical practice to Skokie Hospital where he is an inte-gral part of teaching residents and students from Rush Medical College. He is currently pursuing training in robotic surgery for the general surgeon. Our Trauma Nurse Coordinators are currently conducting a study to assess management of pain in trauma patients. Department of Surgery 2015 Annual Report 17James Boffa, MD Division Chief Andrew Agos, MD Carlos Ortega, MDPhilip Theodoropoulos, MDClinical Program Highlights The Division was established in February 2012 to care for critically ill surgical patients promptly to improve outcomes. NorthShore has four Trauma Centers. The Level 1 Trauma Center at Evanston Hospital has a trauma surgeon immediately available at all times for patients arriving in the Emergency Department. Evanston Hospital also has an operating room and staff available within minutes of arrival. The Level 1 designation also ensures that crucial specialists are available within one hour. NorthShore Glenbrook, Skokie and Highland Park Hospitals are designated as Level 2 Trauma Centers, meaning a trauma surgeon is available within 30 minutes. Evanston Hospital serves as a resource for these Level 2 Trauma Centers. If patients require a higher level of care, the Evanston trauma team helps coordinate a safe and prompt transfer to its Level 1 Trauma Center. All Division physicians are boar-certified with Andrew Agos, MD, and Carlos Ortega, MD, having additional board certification in surgical critical care. The Division's Trauma Nurse Coordinator is June Smith, RN. Clinical Innovations and Research Highlights The Division works closely with colleagues in the Emergency Department, the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the Operating Room to provide expert surgical care. Trauma surgeons care for surgical emergencies such as hemorrhage, airway issues Division of Trauma/Acute Care Surgery/ Surgical Critical Care Division Surgeons Dr. James Boffa leads the Division of Trauma/Acute Care Surgery/Surgical Critical Care, which includes trauma centers at all four NorthShore Hospitals.18 NorthShore University HealthSystem Medical GroupClinical Program Highlights New Faculty In the last year, we have added two new faculty members: Jaclyn Milose, MD, and Sandi Tenfelde, PhD, APN. Dr. Milose is a urologist who provides comprehensive urological care and specializes in urogenital reconstructive surgery. She sees both male and female patients at Glenbrook, Evanston and Highland Park Hospitals. Dr. Tenfelde is a sexual health expert who sees primarily female patients with sexual health issues at the John and Carol Walter Center for Urological Health (Walter Center) at the Glenbrook Hospital campus. Division Growth The Division of Urology continues to grow in all areas of urological care. The core of urology at NorthShore is the Walter Center. Additionally, patients are seen in our Vernon Hills, Gurnee, Highland Park and Evanston offices. Surgical procedures are done at all four NorthShore Hospitals. Wherever they practice, our urological healthcare providers are tasked with the guiding principle of the Walter Center, which is to \"treat the patient, not just the disease.\" Clinical Innovations and Research Highlights The Division of Urology and the Walter Center are intimately associated with the Program for Personalized Cancer Care at NorthShore. Our urologists, in combination with world-class scien-tists, are working to determine the genetic basis of urologic diseases such as prostate cancer. The Division has opened the first personalized, genomic-based prostate health clinic in the country. In this clinic, we use a proprietary genomic DNA testing to assess prostate cancer risk and develop individualized screening, diagnostic and treatment strategies. Teaching and Education Highlights The Division faculty remain actively involved in helping educate the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine urology residents. All members are actively involved in formal didactic programs, as well as teaching in the clinic, hospital, and Operating Room. Sangtae Park, MD, has mentored many summer medical students on research projects, the results of which have been presented at national meetings. The University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine residents complete multiple research projects with NorthShore faculty. For example, at least six different residents have submitted abstracts to the 2016 national urology meeting.Division of Urology Michael McGuire, MD Division Chief Faculty and Accomplishments All our urologists diagnose and treat all aspects of urological diseases. However, many of our faculty members have special interests. Urologists Michael McGuire, MD, (Division Chief) is a fellow-ship-trained urologic oncologist whose practice emphasizes bladder cancer (especially continent urinary diversions) and advanced prostate cancer detection by MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy. Michael Blum, MD, a NorthShore native, has provided exceptional urologic care for 30 years including open prostate cancer surgery, as well as treatment of kidney stones and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Peter Colegrove, MD, has a special interest in erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence.Brian Helfand MD, PhD, a true physician- scientist, specializes in cutting-edge, genomic- based prostate cancer care. Additionally he performs the most robotic radical prostatectomies in our system. Thomas Keeler, MD, another almost 30-year member of the Division, supplies supreme quality care in all aspects of urology. Jaclyn Milose, MD, the newest member of the Division, is specialty-trained in urological reconstruction and advanced surgical treatment of erectile dysfunction and incontinence. She is also available to treat those women with other urological diseases who wish to see a female healthcare provider. Kristian Novakovic, MD, another fellowship- trained urological oncologist, specializes in organ-preserving kidney cancer surgery and leads the prostate cancer active surveillance study. Sangtae Park MD, MPH, leads our programs in minimally invasive surgery for kidney and prostate surgery. Additionally, he is the director of the metabolic stone clinic for the evaluation and man-agement of recurrent and complicated urological stone disease. Clinical PhDs Jeffrey Albaugh, PhD, APN, CUCNS, a renowned worldwide authority on sexual health, treats both men and women and has been an invited lecturer both nationally and internationally on numerous occasions. Sandi Tenfelde PhD, APN, the other new member of our faculty, focuses her practice on women with sexual health issues who, understand-ably, often prefer to discuss these problems with a female healthcare provider.Division Surgeons For more information, visit northshore.org/urologyDepartment of Surgery 2015 Annual Report 19 Clinical Program Highlights New Faculty In 2015, the Division welcomed Alfonso Tafur, MD, a specialist in vascular medicine. Dr. Tafur treats diseases of the vascular system that do not require surgical intervention. Division Growth The Division is anchored in its new clinic space at the Skokie Ambulatory Care Center as a component of the multidisciplinary NorthShore Cardiovascular Institute. Our vascular surgeons provide comprehensive vascular surgery services at all four NorthShore Hospitals as well as clinics in Cook and Lake counties. Clinical Innovations and Research HighlightsThe Division recently acquired a state-of-the-art laser for treatment of spider veins which can be used in conjunction with, or in place of, traditional injection therapy. The Division, along with our Center for Biomedical Research Informatics (CBRI), designed and imple-mented a comprehensive Epic toolkit that improves clinical workflow, improves patient care by reducing omissions and errors in documentation, and allows information to be stored discretely for future quality and research projects. The Division participates in a variety of research projects ranging from retrospective reviews of our patient experience to clinical trials sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. We also collaborate with the Department of Radiology on studies aimed at improving magnetic resonance imaging. We continue to participate in the national Vascular Quality Initiative, allowing our surgeons to track outcomes and focus on quality improvement. Teaching and Educational Highlights NavYash Gupta, MD, Omar Morcos, MD, Benjamin Lind, MD, and Nancy Schindler, MD, MHPE, participated in the Open Surgical Skills Course at Evanston Hospital. Dr. Lind and Tina Desai, MD, mentored a resident research project that culminated in a presentation at the Strandness Symposium and Vascular Care. Dr. Lind, along with Hector Ferral, MD, presented results of their research, \"Complications of arterial and venous catheter-directed thrombolysis,\" at the annual meeting of the Society for Interventional Radiology. Honors, Awards and Academic Recognition Drs. Gupta, Lind and Morcos received Excellence in Teaching Awards from the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. Dr. Lind received a NorthShore Excellence in Nurse-Physician Relationship Award.Division of Vascular Surgery NavYash Gupta, MD Joseph MD Benjamin Lind, MDOmar Morcos, MDNancy Schindler, MD, MHPEDr. Gupta was invited to contribute several video-recorded courses for the Vascular Surgery Comprehensive Review offered by the American Physician Institute for Advanced Professional Studies. Other Accomplishments Dr. Gupta was interviewed on Fox News Chicago's Conversations in Health on topics related to the diagnosis and treatment of vascular disease. Dr. Gupta published the results of an international trial of a dry-powder fibrin sealant. He served as the Principal Investigator for the vascular surgery portion of the trial. The results were presented at the annual meeting of the Society of Academic and Research Surgery. Joseph Caprini, MD, was invited to speak at numerous national and international venues on topics related to venous thromboembolism and anticoagulation. Dr. Lind is completing the NorthShore University HealthSystem Fellowship in Quality and Safety, focusing on reducing postoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Dr. Morcos was named to the Perioperative Planning Committee and is spearheading the rede-sign of our pre- and postoperative care algorithms. Dr. Schindler was promoted to Clinical Professor of Surgery at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine and to Vice President of Physician Development for NorthShore Medical Group. Division Surgeons For more information, visit northshore.org/vascularsurgery Dr. Omar Morcos has expertise in abdominal aortic and thoracic aneurismal disease, peripheral vascular disease and carotid artery disease, and was one of three Division surgeons who received an Excellence in Teaching Award from the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine.20 NorthShore University HealthSystem Medical GroupLast year, the faculty of NorthShore Department of Surgery performed close to 22,000 surgical procedures. In addition, they saw more than 161,000 patients in clinics and conducted 157 clinical trials. These achievements position this Department among the leading surgery providers in our region, offering our patients a wide array of innovative and effective patient care services. In addition to the high proportion of favorable outcomes this surgical volume delivers, it also testifies to our growing diversity of expertise available at NorthShore. But while quantity has a quality of its own, our continued progress as a leading academic center for surgical innovation and personal - ized patient care continues to move upwards because of the philanthropic vision of our corporate and Foundation partners and the generosity of our grateful patients. These sponsors and donors have chosen to invest in our transformative initiatives and collaborative projects that have brought us national recognition and established our faculty as opinion leaders. We continue to experience the dramatic multiplier effect of philanthropy in many areas: Our Program for Personalized Cancer Care, generously seeded by the Walter and Rappeport families, continues to attract funding from other donors who wish to advance our study of cancer genomics and improve our ability to detect and treat earlier at-risk patients and educate their families about future susceptibilities. At the Grainger Center for Simulation and Innovation, our interdisciplinary team has increased the number of workshops offered in minimally invasive surgery, grown corporate sponsorship and exhibitions, developed new procedures to train Operating Room teams and simulate surgical crises, and expanded NorthShore's presence at national conferences, while increasing their production of leading presentations, articles and book chapters in the academic realm. Thanks to the support of the North Suburban Healthcare Foundation, our High-Risk Breast Cancer Program has been launched to much acclaim and has attracted additional support for genomics research and comparative outcomes research. Additional research on breast cancer risk stratification, personal - ized surgical planning, and the racial disparities in breast cancer screening and treatment have all been underwritten by generous donors, some of whom are themselves breast cancer survivors. Our patients can benefit significantly from new insights into genomics, cancer biology and medical informatics funded thanks to philanthropy. All these and other philanthropic gifts have enabled our surgeons and scientists to improve the evidentiary basis for new diagnostic tests, personalized surgical strategies and planning tools for the timing, targeting and delivery of safer, surer and more com - passionate care. This same evidence will help validate expanded insurance coverage and provide the access and affordability for these new patient-centered services so many need. We thank all of you whose generosity will help others.2015 Report on Philanthropy 2015 annual dinner celebrating the Rob Brooks Fund for Personalized Prostate Cancer Care.
