For more information about the difference between homeopathy and allopathy, read the article below.", "sitename": "Icliniq", "date": "2018-08-20", "cleaned_text": "are two different branches of medical science. Both focus on the same goal, which is to treat the disease, but both use different ways of treating it. Usually, there is a perception that some diseases are cured best by homeopathy, and some are with allopathy. However, this is not true. Both of them can cure all types of diseases but with different approaches. What Is Homeopathy? In the word [homeopathy](https://www.icliniq.com/articles/alternative-medicine/homeopathy-myths-and-facts), homeo means same, and pathy means suffering, which means \"similar suffering\". Therefore, homeopathy literally translates to \"similar suffering.\" The concept behind the treatment modality of homeopathy is that a substance that causes particular symptoms can also serve to relieve those symptoms. The basis of homeopathy is the idea that by diluting the same drugs, they can be used to treat similar symptoms that have distinct root causes. In addition, homeopathic doctors believe that the more a substance is diluted, the more effective it is at treating symptoms. Homeopathic remedies are known for increasing the immune system rather than going after microorganisms to fight disease-causing causes. Homeopathic medicines can improve the patient's psychological, emotional, and physical well-being, which is a crucial component of treatment and strengthens the body's immunity. What Is Allopathy? Unlike homeopathy, which focuses on the root cause of the disease rather than symptoms, allopathy focuses on treating the symptoms of the disease instead of the root cause. Allopathic treatment targets the body's immunity system to relieve the symptoms. The word allopathic is derived from the Greek \"allos,\" which means opposite, and the word \"pathos\" meaning \"to suffer.\" Therefore, allopathy means correcting symptoms with its opposite. Allopathic medicines can cure a variety of diseases. The most common medicines used in allopathy are listed below: Allopathic medicines also replace deficiencies of some of the hormones of the body, such as: - [Insulin](https://www.icliniq.com/articles/drug-and-supplements/insulin). - Thyroid hormone. - Estrogen. - Testosterone. In addition, allopathy includes treatment by surgical methods and radiation therapy. Preventive care is also included in this branch of medical science, like vaccinations and prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of infections post-surgical procedures. How Are Diseases Treated Using Allopathy and Homeopathy? - Homeopathic medicines are believed to be the opposite of allopathic medicines because it works on the concept that whatever has caused the illness in the first place can also become the solution for the treatment. In contrast to allopathy, it uses small dosages of diluted substances. - Allopathy medicines include drugs and surgeries to treat the disease; however, homeopathy improves the body's response to the disease to cure it. - In allopathy, the particular affected organ or body part is targeted and associated with the risk and side effects. There are chances of the spread of infection to the surrounding tissues. On the contrary, homeopathic treatment is not associated with any risks or side effects. In addition, homeopathic treatment focuses on treating the whole body and is not restricted to treating the affected body part only. - The homeopathic practitioner gives a very low dosage of medicines to boost immunity which then fights the disease. In addition, the person who is suffering from any disease is exposed to other similar diseases in a weaker form to help the immune system develop antibodies to fight the disease. - There is a difference in the preparation of medicines in homeopathic and allopathic treatment. Homeopathic medicines undergo repeated dilution and shaking, known as potentisation. The practitioner believes that this potentisation can boost the body's natural defense and healing. What Are the Importance of Homeopathic and Allopathic Treatment? - Homeopathic treatment depends on the case in which disease diagnosis has comparatively less importance than the person's individuality. Therefore, a well-taken case history is very necessary for homeopathy. Still, there are so many homeopaths treating it like allopathy, but both treatment modalities have different principles, rules, and outcomes. - Both of them have some advantages and disadvantages. The difference is that both have their own role in the well-being of patients. However, if an individual is taking homeopathic treatment, one should know the basic concept of homeopathy. Many people prefer to self-medicate with the help of the internet or books and suggest their medicines to others. However, this is not beneficial for patients. Therefore, patients should understand that homeopathy is totally different from other fields of medicine like allopathy, Ayurveda, Unani, etc. - Every field of medicine is different, and homeopathy is a complete science in itself. The major difference in homeopathy is that there is no need for a \"material dose.\" One of the fundamental principles is the \"law of the minimum,\" which means there is no need to take a bag full of medicines throughout life. - An individual just needs the correctly chosen medicine after a well-taken case history with a minimum dose and in the simplest form. There are so many examples of successful treatment which are no less than any miracle by itself. Many long-standing chronic diseases of many years have been treated with a single dose of homeopathy. - On the contrary, allopathic medicines can not cure chronic diseases like blood pressure, thyroid problems, diabetes, etc., but they treat the diseases by controlling the symptoms with medicines. In addition, medicines for treating chronic diseases possess side effects. To treat the side effects, another medication has to be taken. However, allopathic medicines cure the symptoms instantly; for example, a running nose can be instantly stopped by taking Levocetirizine medicine. Conclusion: Homeopathy and allopathy are effective in treating various illnesses. Both treatment modalities have their own advantages and disadvantages, and both work on different principles for treating illness. Individuals can choose any of them and should be aware of their mechanism of action for treating illness. "}
