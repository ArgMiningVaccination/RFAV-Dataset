Although the technical results ofourefforts aredirected toabroad cross section ofscientists and engineers charged with environmental measurements, NBSdevotes nearly 30man-years of effort toassisting other Federal agencies with special environmental measurement problems related toeach agency's mission. Theobjectives oftheAirandWater Measurement Program asStandard todevelop methods tosupport these standards, andtoprovide andevaluate chemical needed ourselves asenvironmental concerned with thereliability ofall measurements andparticularly with those measurements which affect national policies. Theeffectiveness oftheNBSprogram inairandwater measurement depends critically upon those needs. Thus, symposium associated with air andwater measurements. Thetopics chosen forinclusion intheSymposium ranged from the role ofStandard Reference Materials inEnvironmental Measurement totheApplication of Laser Technology toAirPollution Measurement. These topics were chosen either because there isnotyet aconsensus regarding theapplicability ofliving inharmony with ournatural resources.

Analytical results indicated excessive suspended solids intheeffluent, yetwhen compared toaneighboring domestic sewage one-half thesuspended solids levels, theturbidities were equivalent. Alittle detective work showed that each installation wasusing adifferent fiberglass filter. Both types offilters were evaluated onboth filter obtained bytheother type offiberglass filter. Incidentally, both types offiberglass filters are acceptable according totheEPAManual. Bythis change from onetype toanother type of suspended solids suspended solids were metandfinal filtration was notrequired. Theestimated capital cost forfinal filtration forthis installation would have been $900,000. That expenditure wasnotmade. Variability reduction isanother example. Much waste treatment design isbased ona maximum load. Oneoftheresults ofananalytical quality control program isareduction in variability. Much oftheeffluent variability turns outtobeanalytical rather than process. Itisaknown fact that equipment costs for50to70percent reductions aremuch less than that required is realized while still meeting effluent limits. Thelast case inpoint involves cyanide. Theproposed effluents regulations were issued cyanide. Since that time, theproposed toxic effluent regulations have been withdrawn. Inconclusion, accuracy isexpensive, butworth it. Amillion dollar lab, with allthe fancy equipment, andhighly educated people, with allthecredentials, does notmean that their analytical result isright. Only theright answer isaccurate. Theright answer isassured with anAnalytical Quality Assurance program. 8 NATIONAL BUREAU OFSTANDARDS SPECIAL PUBLICATION 464.

Park Ridge, Illinois 60068, USA 1.Introduction Atmosphere monitoring forcontaminant gases andvapors using thecharcoal tube sampling technique isbecoming more widespread, particularly because oftheincreased activity of OSHA inrecent years ingenerating technique ofawide variety theNIOSH recommended design ofcharcoal tube isemployed together with asmall battery operated personal sampling pump, avariety ofwhich areavailable from different manufacturers (figure 1). Theuseofanadsorbent material such ascharcoal provides aconvenient andcompact system forpersonnel exposure and avariety of other adsorbents arealso coming into useforother applications where charcoal isnotthe most suitable adsorbent. Intheabsence ofmore specific monitoring techniques, itcanbe expected that this sampling method will remain inwidespread useformany years despite the known limitations andscope forinaccuracies, many ofwhich have been documented from thefinal inthe report butwhich serve toindicate that gross inaccuracies canoccur even also theprecision ofresults ismarkedly inferior atlowcontaminant concentrations.

ACHIEVING ACCURACY INENVIRONMENTAL MEASUREMENTS USING ACTIVATION ANALYSIS Donald A.Becker Institute forMaterials Research National Bureau ofStandards Washington, DC20234, USA 1.Introduction Theanalytical technique ofactivation analysis hasfound acceptance trace element measurements. Inparticular, thecapability for multielement determinations, high sensitivity, andnon-destructive analyses have been important inthis regard. However, toconsistently achieve accuracy inenvironmental analyses requires careful attention todetail anduseofwell facilities. canbest bedescribed byseparation andcounting. Each ofthese component parts should beoptimized considering theenduseforthedata obtained. Once avalid sample isobtained, itmust usually bestored, processed, orsub-sampled. Each process undertaken before irradiation increases thepossibility ofcontamination. Thestatement that activation analysis isgenerally free from \"blanks\" primarily refers to reagent blanks. ablank-free system isthe canbeirradiated asasingle integral piece, etched toeliminate surface contamination andcontamination beneath thesurface duetorecoil from nuclear reactions occurring from surface contaminants. (Treatment several different etchants isrecommended bemade under clean conditions using noncontaminating implements andcontainers. Contami- nation isaparticularly difficult problem forphysical processing ofsolid samples {e.g.^ grinding, cutting, pulverizing, eta.), orforliquid samples. There aremany papers intheliterature which indicate that some types ofenvironmental samples undergo changes instructure andchemical state even when dried atroom temperature. This should nothave agreat effect onthetotal trace element content inmost cases, but 43 ifspeciation, organic extractable trace elements, etc., extensive survey oftheliterature onsampling, sample handling andlong term storage goes into much greater detail onthetechniques and problems involved [1]^. part indetermining thefinal oftheactivation analysis. Several factors which affect theaccuracy andprecision ofreactor activation analysis arediscussed below. Most irradiation facilities have asignificant variation intheneutron fluxwithin a single irradiation this andiron (for long irradiations) have been found towork well. Other problems during irradiation include variations intheneutron energy spectrum, production ofinterfering nuclear reactions, andneutron self shielding. Themethods and problems inreactor characterization have been addressed more completely elsewhere [2]. C.Radiochemical separations Thejudicious useofanappropriate radiochemical separation canoften change a marginal trace element determination into asimple andeffective one, often with greatly improved accuracy andprecision. While separations does require theservices ofachemist, andusually onewith insuch the arewell worth theincreased time andeffort needed. Theuseof modern semiconductor detectors hasalso made group radiochemical separations animportant tool inactivation analysis, especially forvery lowlevel trace analysis. Some oftheproblems affecting accuracy andprecision inradiochemical separations include sample dissolution difficulties (incomplete dissolution andlosses during dis- solution); inadequate carrier exchange with thesample trace element(s); volatilization losses (during preirradiation processing, during theactual irradiation, when opened after irradiation, andespecially during sample dissolution before carrier exchange); adsorption effects oncontainers (irradiation container, dissolution container, orseparation con- tainer); quality oftheseparation procedure itself (single element, multiple element, complicated procedures, etc.); andfinally, chemical yield measurements (reproducibility, with quantitative yields highly desirable). Each oftheabove aspects canintroduce orsystematic bias into accepted reproducible procedure. Figures inbrackets indicate theliterature references attheendofthis paper. 44 However, even with allofthecautions mentioned above, theuseofradiochemical separations intheactivation analysis program affords thecapability foralmost allelements, rather than must beaccurately determined. Basically, most activation systems consist ofasingle photon detector [Ge(Li), Ge,orNal(Tl)] andassoci- ated ofsome such asystem, a variety ofsample radioactivity levels andsizes canbecounted rather easily. The requirements foranalytical accuracy andprecision foreach individual determination will toacertain systems. What isoften notrealized is that even relatively small differences between sample andstandard, orfrom sample to sample, inanyoneofmany variables canresult inasignificant bias count rates. Inaprevious publication, thesystematic biases photon counting in activation analysis [3]wasdescribed indetail. Forpurposes ofdiscussion, these biases were separated sample sample configuration, isboth rather important andoften ignored, itwill bediscussed briefly here also. Differences insource configuration between samples orbetween sample andstandard canbeasignificant source ofanalytical Most a13percent connected totheanalysis, both andsystematic. These errors aremuch greater when useofreference materials. These reference materials areusually carefully studied materials which have documented homogeniety andelemental composition. There arevarying levels ofintegrity associated material which hasbeen analyzed foroneormore characteristics, and isissued bya recognized standards organization oranational laboratory, toasa certified of theanalytical system. When independent replicates ofthereference been analyzed, ofvalues obtained indicates oftheanalytical system, while thedeviation oftheaverage value from the\"true\" value indicates the accuracy ofthesystem. Ifthevalue obtained issignificantly different value errors. Evaluation ofthefirst component, sampling sample handling, ismuch more difficult todetect andevaluate, since inmost cases each environmental sample isunique andcannot bereproduced. However, rather than assume complete acceptance ortotal confidence intheir results, theactivation analyst should continually strive forthebest methods andtechniques possible, consistent with the required costs.

B.Instrumental background correction methods Theinstrumental background correction methods which have been developed foratomic absorption aredesigned toeliminate only interferences exhibiting broadband spectral character.

Lists ofspectral lines lying close tocommonly used analytical lines have been compiled for those transitions which have been observed [13]. More complete wavelength tables [14] show thatmost analytically useful resonance lines fall quite close tonumerous lines frommany commonly encountered elements. Thepresence ofthese lines must betaken into account when attempting ofsamples with complex matrices byAALBC roCEWMAA. Theadvent ofmore sensitivities andhigh atomization efficiencies, make thepresence ofnonanalyte absorbing lines more likely.

Marple andWillike [1]^ have established design criteria efficiency asafunction ofnozzle-to-plate spacing, Reynolds Number ,(etc, ),which facilitates cascade design. Thecontrolling relationship between the50percent cutoff particle diameter Dr must include some combination ofreduced nozzle diameters andhigh volume flow with theimplied high nozzle velocity, Vq,andattendant large pressure drop, aP. Thehigh particle velocity canlead toparticle bounce andreduced collection using these design criteria inaten- stage arrangement with calculated collection efficiency curves, shown infigure 2.The50 percent cutoff points cover theparticle whoformulated perturbation analysis byStockbridge [5]correctly accounted for theaddition ofdiscrete mass increments andapplies more directly totheuseoftheQCM in Theambient rate inml/min.

Once this volume flow waschosen, theseparate stage nozzles were designed forthedesired particle sizes purposes must itself becharacterized astoconcentration andsize generators. Thealternate approach ofcorrelation with similar instruments is questionable since completely different collection techniques areused. Theprimary area ofconcern isparticle collection efficiency, particularly inthe submicron range where high nozzle flow velocities exist.

This would result inabroadening oftherange ofparticle sizes collected ina stage and agreater uncertainty intheactual size distribution.

Thedetachable chamber unit wasconstructed entirely of autoclavable polycarbonate topermit steam sterilization for15minutes at15lbs. psi. A small Teflon coated stirring pellet placed inside thechamber prior tosterilization pro- vided thenecessary internal movement when plastic guide fins and anose cone were attached tothesupportive base unit. 3.Discussion Workers inthepast have utilized dialysis cellophane, andother dialysis have given way torigid chambers andrings that support microporous filter membranes (ormembrane filters) fabricated from mixed cellulose esters, asbestos, orplastic. During evaluation ofthechamber diffusion, experiments were conducted using avariety membranes. cellulosic membranes tested provided rapid diffusion butwere toofragile tocompare thesolute permeability andglucose astest substances. Standard concentrations ofboth substances were injected into thechambers with asyringe andwithdrawn similarly at12hour intervals. Results showed that were superior tocellulosic membranes with regard tosolute requiring less time toachieve agiven percent exchange between thechamber contents and outside environment. Internal agitation lessened thetime necessary forthis exchange. In addition, after 10days exposure toseawater, thecellulosic membranes became exceedingly brittle andcrumbled easily upon finger contact. Since then, other investigators have confirmed that cellulosic membranes experiments were conducted with eight representative species ofbacteria allrecently isolated from environmental sources. These included five opportunistic indi- cators longer than between these over aseven temperature. 246 4.Conclusion thelife thecold winter months would seem inadvisable formany coastal regions.

Table 1 Baseline concentrations ofsome trace metals inopen-ocean waters reported inthelast 35years Reference Units Cu Pb Compiled Data 0.110 3 0.5-4 1971 [28] yg/5, indicate paper. 249 This reviews briefly themethods used bytheOcean Chemistry Division inobtain- ingtrace analysis data andputs particular emphasis shipboard clean laboratories, which webelieve tobethefirst for marine oftheextremely lowconcentrations involved. 2.AUnified Approach toUltra-Trace Analysis inSeaWater Although workers have published fairly detailed information onspecific aspects of ultra-trace analysis such assampling, storage, orclean laboratory techniques, very few meaningful seawater forultra-trace analysis, onemust keep inmind that contamination lurks inevery corner sewage, for along time oceanographers didnotseriously concern themselves with such problems, even though many ofthem hadbeen pointed outtwenty years ago[31]. Thus, sampling andshipboard handling techniques have been theweakest links inmarine ultra- trace analysis. Improved techniques have been designed inrecent years inorder tocurb contamination. 250 1)Sampling techniques Wehave employed anumber ofhand collection methods using small launches away from themother ship. These methods minimize thecontamination, butthey cannot beused unless theseaisvery calm. These methods moreover yield only shallow samples andarenotwell suited forcollecting large numbers ofsamples. forultra-trace hydrocarbons than forultra-trace metals. a.Ultra-trace forultra-trace metal sampling aretoocontaminated [5]andthe clean ones, such asthose using peristaltic pumps andacid-cleaned Teflon tubing, cannot be used toobtain very deep samples. Wehave been using PVC^ Niskin bottles coated ofmetals [6]. steel hydrowire, messengers andweights. These andthenewer models astheTop-Drop Niskin [5]andtheGo-Flo Sampling Bottle [7], arenotentirely satisfactory because open and/or they aremade ofPVC, apossible source ofzinc samplers which penetrate thesurface oftheocean ina closed position should soon beavailable forultra-trace metal analysis. Patterson andco- workers have been testing have been used successfully fordissolved hydrocarbon gases [12] but their utility hasnotbeen demonstrated hydrocarbons orother molecular should beperformed operations include subsampling, acidification, spiking, filtration, preconcentration, extraction, etc. Traditionally, these operations have been carried outinthewetlaboratories ofoceanographic vessels, thus being subjected tocontamination asdiscussed earlier. contamination atthis stage ithasbeen suggested that seawater behandled inplastic enclosures away from other activities. Asimilar approach hydrocarbon work. Instead, seagoing laboratory modules, complete with andbolted vessels. butonly involved portable wetlaboratories rather than clean laboratories.

Special attention wasdevoted totheaquatic ecosystem controlling most ofitscomponents (water, suspended material, periphyton, benthic organisms, bottom sediments, fish). This investigation required adetailed sampling program with respect tothechoice ofthesampling sites andtothesampling frequency. Thestretch under investigation ofthePoriver; the pollution load brought byeffluents isvery high, this area being downstream from themajor pollution sources (industrial, agricultural, andurban) ofnorthern Italy. This stretch maybedistinguished into 2zones: thefirst, upstream from thedamofa hydroelectric power station, characterized byadecreasing river current, and asecond one, downstream, with aswift river current. Despite these unfavorable conditions, thewater quality isgenerally satisfactory, thus indicating theefficacy oftheself-purifying power oftheriver. This paper deals mainly with problems associated with thesampling andanalysis ofthe most significant components (water, suspended material andbottom sediments) ofariverine ecosystem affected bydifferent pollution sources. Theinvestigated stretch 20Km) covers eight sampling stations (fig. 1),sixupstream andtwodownstream ofthedam.

However, comparison ofPQUandPQDB2 sulfate data indicate removal of20-50 percent ofthesulfate mass inthediffusion battery, demonstrating clearly that forthese rural ambient aerosol samples, 1/5to1/2ofthesulfate mass ispresent inthesuboptical size range (<0.3ym). Comparison oftheanalytical data with thevolume shows that most ofthe mass foracid andammonium during thesampling period have also been compared with that forsulfate. Qualitatively different temporal patterns were observed foracidity compared with sulfate. Sulfate episodes during the7/22-23 and7/26-27 periods were notaccompanied bylarge acid concentrations whereas during the7/29-30 period large acid concentrations were present andshowed diurnal variation. During daytime samples for 7/29 during the7/29-30 night sample itwasmuch reduced and associated with larger particles. This contrasts with thediurnal behavior ofammonium (figure 3)which principally with optical -sized particles.

These pollutant measuring methods have been based onmany principles ranging from manual toautomatic, (exclusive ofvisible emissions bytrained observers) instationary source enforcement programs based onaconsideration ofthepossible program applications and their scope. Inthis process, advantages anddisadvantages ofremote monitoring technology will bedefined techniques. Major elements agency's program andinventory towhich thestandards apply, notification ofaffected sources, conduct ofsurveil- lance activities and, finally, administrative orjudicial enforcement ofstandards, if necessary, toensure compliance. 2.Discussion source monitoring areto locate affected sources; determine their compliance status; where necessary, develop compliance schedules; monitor increments incompliance schedules; andmonitor toensure final compliance. Aspecial obtained infield surveillance procedures employing pollutant emission measurement techniques such asremote monitoring. Remote techniques maybeused therefore, inmonitoring activities directly related to enforcement ofFederal andstate/local agency regulations including: (a)Determination ofstationary source asource (presently orpreviously onacompliance schedule) iscomplying with emission 1imitations; (b) Case development activities, i.e., collection ofdata specifically tosupport administrative orjudicial actions; and 387 (c)Enforcement surveillance i.e., screening studies toevaluate unknown status ofsources. There aremany enforcement related activities inwhich remote monitoring techniques mayprove tobevaluable; these include, butarenotlimited to,thefollowing: modeling procedures. Control agency enforcement monitoring activities potentially encompass literally hundreds ofthousands ofsources. Thus theneed foraccurate, precise, cost-effective monitoring onapproxi- mately 22,000 major sources which represent 85percent oftotal stationary source pollution. Under \u00a7111, standards ofperformance fornewstationary sources. Federal standards (some delegated tocertain states) have been promulgated for24source categories. Todate, approximately 350sources have been monitored anditcanbeexpected that atleast 1,500 sources peryear will come under regulations. Finally, \u00a7112 provides foremission standards forhazardous airpollutants. Under promulgated rules, approximately 800fixed sources and3,300/year transitory sources require enforcement monitoring ona routine basis. Remote monitoring techniques offer anumber ofoperational ofmore sources andareas inashorter period oftime than manual test lessmanpower intensive inasmuch assome engineers. Unannounced andNon-interference Monitoring -Remote Monitoring techniques provide a most effective tool forcompliance monitoring, even atnight with active systems, without entry into thepremises ofthesource. Inaddition, remote monitoring interferes with normal plant operations toalesser degree than monitoring with manual methods. Rapid Response -Inemergency episodes involving environmental pollutants, thehighly mobile andflexible remote monitors canbeused toassess thedocument theextent ofthe emergency more rapidly than stationary iwsitu monitors. Enforcement countermeasures can, therefore, beinstituted more rapidly. Anumber ofdisadvantages totheuseofremote monitors canbeidentified. Rates -Most regulations arewritten intheform of mass emission limitations. Therefore, documentation ofviolation requires determina- tion ofmass emissions rates for aparticular facility. Most remote monitors will provide measurements inrelative concentration terms. Conversion tomass emission rates requires asecond measurement, in-situ orremote, using instrumentation such as alaser Doppler velocimeter. 388 High Initial Costs -Remote monitoring instruments aregenerally more costly than theextractive orin-situ system. Similarly, active remote systems aremore expensive than passive systems. Itcanbeassumed, however, that cost ofinstrumentation would bereduced asmore areproduced andused inthefield.

Collaborative testing stationary source emission test methods presents asetofparticularly difficult problems. Itis enormously expensive tomeasure source emissions inreplicate, thesampling portion of emission test methods are amajor part ofthetotal method anditisphysically difficult toobtain adequate replicate measurements.

Thepreferred procedure istogather site andthen make simultaneous measurements ofambient airorastack emission using the method under test, Areport describing thetest anditsresults isessential. From the information method canbeprepared andrecommended hasevolved time simple andnaive approach used earlier. Inearlier efforts atstandardizing airpollution methods, particularly those specified inFederal regulations, theassumption wasmade that these were well written, fully described andadequately researched methods needing nofurther evaluation. Forthis reason pre-collaborative test evaluations were allbuteliminated andplans made collaborative testing after only alimited amount ofevaluation. Experience hasshown this was apoor assumption. While itistrue that themethods arebased on sound measurement principles, occasionally procedural details were toosketchy toensure that different users would usethemethodology inthesame way. Toomany options were sometimes permitted andfaulty orincorrect instructions were sometimes encountered. The effort invested inpre-collaborative testing evaluation ofmethods hasdone much toeliminate these introduced program through pre-collaborative test aremuch theessential statistical results from thecollaborative collaborative testing ofambient airmethods A. High-volume procedure fortotal suspended particulate matter [3] This test wascarried outbyhaving twelve laboratories simultaneously sample the ambient airatacommon site over afour dayperiod.

Inthis method, Method ofPerformance theconcentration ofparticulate matter concurrently made which permit thedetermination ofthetotal volumetric flow rate from the stack andappropriate Wehave tested Method 5atseveral different kinds ofemission sources such ascoal fired power plants, municipal incinerators and aPortland cement plant. Earlier collaborative tests ofMethod 5made some severe compromises which likely sufficient forbetween-laboratory variation estimation. Blocking ofthesamples into units when emissions were constant also proved tobe difficult because process conditions varied somewhat inspite ofefforts tokeep them constant. Theresults from theearlier tests Method 5suffered from poor precision. Forexample, within- andbetween-laboratory standard deviations, asapercent of mean values, and38.7%, respectively, from tests atamunicipal incincerator [20]. However, single-laboratory studies showed that Method 5iscapable of considerably better precision under carefully controlled conditions, using aspecial multiple probe assembly execute itinaproper andreproducible manner. Forthis reason, test participants were allowed tousethemethod inaccordance with their interpretation ofthemethod's instructions. However, itisnowapparent that themethod lacked sufficient clarity insome critical areas anditwasrevised tomake it clearer, remove some options andgive more explicit Therevised version incinerator made useofaspecially designed sampling system and aunique test design which permitted unambiguous replicates tobeobtained even iftheprocess changed during the test. Thesecond test permitted eight samples tobetaken simultaneously, thus strengthening thestatistical conclusions made from test results. Also, weassured ourselves that only competent sampling teams were accepted astest participants andthat thetest coordinator exercised sufficient theearlier results. acknowledged with appreciation fortheir assistance in planning andcoordinating thecollaborative tests under contracts with theEnvironmental Protection Agency.

Sources ofasbestos intheenvironment include asbestos andother mineral mining andbeneficiation operations, manufacturing ofasbestos-containing consumer products, fugitive dust sources, such asunpaved roads, consumer useofasbestos-containing products, andnatural weathering andtoalarge percentage oftheearth's crust. Although many varieties ofasbestos minerals exist, only sixaregenerally ashaving commercial chrysotile. Chrysotile constitutes about 95percent oftheworld's production ofasbestos. Analytical techniques that have been andother methods which donotprovide fiber size information. The methods which provide size information areoptical, scanning electron andtransmission electron microscopy. Because fibers indiameter information ontoxicity with fiber technique forasbestos fiber concentration determi- nation must beable toprovide reliable fiber species identification andaccurate size measurements. This limits themethods ofexamination toelectron microscopy. These transmission electron microscopy (TEM) andscanning electron microscopy (SEM). Thescanning electron microscope (SEM) energy dispersive (ED) x-ray microanalysis hasbeen suggested asameans ofidentifying electron sources, however, maybeable toproduce adequate x-ray spectra from smaller fibers. Ambiguities ofasbestos fiber identification mayalso arise from x-rays produced by adjacent oradhering particles, from uncertainties indetermining theexact chemical many researchers consider thetransmission electron microscope (TEM) coupled with selected area electron diffraction (SAED) theonly reliable method for identifying asbestos fibers.

THENATIONAL VOLUNTARY LABORATORY ACCREDITATION PROGRAM T.R.Young ofStandards Washington, DC20234, USA 1.Introduction Program that mayneed consideration affected parties instate andFederal government andintheprivate sector. NVLAP provides a national voluntary system whereby laboratory accreditation programs canbeestablished for specific product areas having need. Thepurpose ofsuch programs istoexamine andaccredit theprofessional andtechnical competence serve regulatory and non-regulatory product evaluation andcertification requirements. Detailed procedures and definitions utilized byNVLAP arecontained inTitle 15,Code ofFederal Regulations, Part 7[1]-^. Additional NVLAP including background, areview of procedures anddiscussion ofNBS's supporting technical role iscontained Proposed Federal Register inMay1975 [3]. Thepublic review period that followed, including two public hearings, provided over 150substantive critiques from Federal andstate agencies, professional andtrade organizations, industries, testing laboratories andindividuals. This public review raised principle issues resulting insignificant revisions ofthe proposed procedures. Theproposed procedures provided forappointment bytheSecretary products within the Thepublic review oftheproposed procedures indicated that this assumption isnot generally valid. Needs forlaboratory accreditation tend tovary with theproduct that is tested. Thus needs forlaboratory overall toclasses oftechnol- ogyortechnical disciplines maybedifficult toassess Therefore, separate services that might result from this approach, therevised procedures allow thegrouping ofsimilar orrelated products when initiating accreditation services. Inaddition, theprocedures forreview ofapplications for accreditation with inbrackets indicate literature references attheendofthis paper. 675 Thesecond principle issue that arose during public review oftheproposed NVLAP concerned participation oftheprivate sector foreach board ofaccreditation. Aboard, consisting ofFederal employees, would be required toconsult with itsadvisory committee when developing accreditation criteria. However, only theboard would make final recommendations regarding accreditation criteria andoperational aspects oftheprogram. Many comments received during public review indicated that avoluntary program should provide formore direct andequal involvement of theprivate sector, particularly committees inlieu ofseparate boards andadvisory committees. These criteria committees, composed of government andprivate sector members, develop andrecommend accreditation criteria tobe promulgated bytheprogram. Thethird significant issue concerned coordination with other laboratory examination andaccreditation programs intheprivate andgovernment sectors. Although, theproposed procedures vaguely referred tosupport ofcoordination efforts, they lacked general or specific provisions regarding promotion orarrangement ofcoordination with other programs thatmayexist orbeindevelopment. Many comments, during public review, addressed this deficiency. They considered amajor benefit ofNVLAP tobeitsfocus forcoordination of laboratory examination andaccreditation programs. Such coordination could work toreduce theduplication oflaboratory examination efforts, reduce confusion regarding thecriteria used andpromote reciprocal recognition oflaboratory assessment programs, domestically and internationally. Inresponse, theprocedures were revised toinclude such coordination as agoal oftheprogram. Forinitiation oflaboratory accreditation programs under NVLAP, provisions were added requiring consideration ofexisting programs inthepublic orprivate sectors. These provisions include consultation with government agencies that maybe impacted byprograms established under NVLAP. Inparticular. Federal regulatory agencies mayhalt, theestablishment ofprograms thatwould adversely affect their existing ordeveloping laboratory accreditation programs. Other revisions intheprogram's procedures resulted from NVLAP's exposure topublic review.

LESSONS TOBELEARNED FROM CLINICAL LABORATORY ACCREDITATION William F,Vincent Director, Cyto Medical Laboratory Bloomfield, Connecticut 06002, USA Consultant onLaboratory Quality Control Laboratory Division Connecticut State Department ofHealth Hartford, Connecticut 06101, USA 1.Introduction Thequestion oflaboratory accreditation, bygovernmental officials andanalysts This decade hasoften been consumer demands forbetter andservices, a rising interest hasdeveloped byconsumer groups, professional andtrade organizations and governmental agencies atalllevels inestablishing programs which will effectively monitor thequality oftheproducts andservices Additionally, as increased emphasis isplaced onlaboratory data tobeused asamonitoring device, it becomes obvious that hastobeareasonable waytoassure that laboratory analyses areapproximately areseveral or Federal), private professional associations orcombinations ofthose. Third, towhat degree allpersonnel inthe laboratory, whoareperforming analyses meet minimal requirements. Fourth, should accreditation bevoluntary analyses. Itwasnotunreasonable laboratory bethefirst under close ofthe quality ofwork analysis (notably physician performing tests onhisorherownpatients,) almost every clinical laboratory inthe nation isregulated byastate agency, theFederal government (Medicare orInterstate) or both. Inrecent years, relatively good programs have been developed forlaboratory analysts from sitdown totalk about laboratory accreditation, accreditation procedures such asproficiency testing, inspections, personnel evaluation, quality assurance programs, etc. long before theaverage environmental analyst knewwhat thewords meant. Rather than trying to\"reinvent thewheel,\" wewould bewell advised to take avery close look attheclinical field. Insome cases, there areprograms which can beadapted ofproficiency testing aswasused forevaluating theproficiency ofclinical laboratories performing clinical chemistry. TheFederal Safe Water Drinking Actauthorizes theEnvironmental Protection Agency to establish guidelines forthecertification oflaboratories performing bacteriological, chemical, organic, andradiological analyses insupport bytheFederal act. TheEPAWork thelessons accreditation. stress that theprogram should beconducted bythestate agency, that is,thestate have \"primacy.\" Asaconsequence, state will beactively certification theEPAguidelines, theFederal forclinical gives very programs. TheFederal reluctance tosurrender licensure tothestates between many ofthestates andtheCenter forDisease Control. TheEPAguidelines, while they place agencies hopeful- lywill play, donotprovide forequivalency status accreditation asitmaylead toamuch better Federal /State relationship. Inthecase oftheFederal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Actof1967 governing laboratories engaged ininterstate commerce, very little encouragement wasgiven tostate agencies. However, theactcontained aseparate section dealing with private which made subject, while has notbeen asgreat asthat involving state agency Thebiggest problem hasbeen--just qualification regulations into anaccrediting program? Fortheclinical laboratory, there have been almost asmany different asthere have been programs! Some Aprogram notconsider andeducation personnel including laboratory trainees. Many persons feel that this isthebesL approach andshould beconducted toanother asjob opportunities present themselves. While certain minimal requirements with regard topersonnel education, training and experience appear tobedesirable andnecessary, there hastobeareasonable andgradual approach ifone istoprevent basically well qualified laboratory personnel being excluded from thefield orseverely limited interms ofjobopportunities. Oneofthe biggest problems that laboratory certification hasbeen precisely this type ofsituation. Forexample, under Federal Medicare regulations, certain minimal requirements have been setformedical technologists. Individuals notmeeting those requirements must pass anexamination bytheendof1977. While this appears tobean equitable approach atfirst glance, ithascreated many problems with theconsequence attheendof1977. about theother clinical laboratory specialties. TheFederal regulations, however, require that they pass anexamination inallareas which formany will bevirtually impossible. Consequently, asaccreditation programs aredeveloped for environmental Thebest societies whowill andpersonnel qualification criteria favoring their membership. 3.Conclusion Nowthatmandatory laboratory accreditation isaround thecorner, thanks totheSafe Water Drinking Act, government agencies andprofessionals must begin tolook closely atthe problem.
