Some are even added to soft drinks and other foods. But there's little or no scientific evidence that energy boosters like ginseng, guarana, and chromium picolinate actually work. Thankfully, there are things you can do to enhance your own natural energy levels. Here are nine tips: 1. Control stress Stress-induced emotions consume huge amounts of energy. Talking with a friend or relative, joining a support group, or seeing a psychotherapist can all help diffuse stress. Relaxation therapies like meditation, self-hypnosis, [yoga](/staying-healthy/the-physical-benefits-of-yoga), and [tai chi](/staying-healthy/the-active-ingredients-of-tai-chi) are also effective tools for reducing stress. 2. Lighten your load One of the main reasons for fatigue is overwork. Overwork can include professional, family, and social obligations. Try to streamline your list of \"must-do\" activities. Set your priorities in terms of the most important tasks. Pare down those that are less important. Consider asking for extra help at work, if necessary. 3. Exercise Exercise almost guarantees that you'll sleep more soundly. It also gives your cells more energy to burn and circulates oxygen. And exercising can lead to higher brain dopamine levels, which helps elevate mood. When walking, pick up the pace periodically to get extra health benefits. 4. Avoid smoking You know smoking threatens your health. But you may not know that smoking actually siphons off your energy by causing insomnia. The nicotine in tobacco is a stimulant, so it speeds the heart rate, raises blood pressure, and stimulates brain-wave activity associated with wakefulness, making it harder to fall asleep. And once you do fall asleep, its addictive power can kick in and awaken you with cravings. 5. Restrict your sleep If you think you may be sleep-deprived, try getting less sleep. This advice may sound odd but determining how much sleep you actually need can reduce the time you spend in bed not sleeping. This process makes it easier to fall asleep and promotes more restful sleep in the long run. Here's how to do it: - Avoid napping during the day. - The first night, go to bed later than normal and get just four hours of sleep. - If you feel that you slept well during that four-hour period, add another 15-30 minutes of sleep the next night. - As long as you're sleeping soundly the entire time you're in bed, slowly keep adding sleep on successive nights. 6. Eat for energy Eating [foods with a low glycemic index](/staying-healthy/4-ways-to-boost-your-energy-naturally-with-breakfast) \u2014 whose sugars are absorbed slowly \u2014 may help you avoid the lag in energy that typically occurs after eating quickly absorbed sugars or refined starches. Foods with a low glycemic index include whole grains, high-fiber vegetables, nuts, and healthy oils such as olive oil. In general, high-carbohydrate foods have the highest glycemic indexes. Proteins and fats have glycemic indexes that are close to zero. 7. Use caffeine to your advantage [Caffeine](/staying-healthy/the-buzz-about-caffeine-and-health) does help increase alertness, so having a cup of coffee can help sharpen your mind. But to get the energizing effects of caffeine, you have to use it judiciously. It can cause insomnia, especially when consumed in large amounts or after 2 p.m. 8. Limit alcohol One of the best hedges against the midafternoon slump is to avoid [drinking alcohol](/mind-and-mood/alcohol-and-fatigue) at lunch. The sedative effect of alcohol is especially strong at midday. Similarly, avoid a five o'clock cocktail if you want to have energy in the evening. If you're going to drink, do so in moderation at a time when you don't mind having your energy wind down. 9. Drink water What's the only nutrient that has been shown to enhance performance for all but the most demanding endurance activities? It's not some pricey sports drink. It's [water](/staying-healthy/how-much-water-should-you-drink). If your body is short of fluids, one of the first signs is a feeling of fatigue.
