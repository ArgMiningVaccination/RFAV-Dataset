In addition to providing detailed diagnostic data, these methods have the potential to simulate patient-speci c interventions and to predict their outcome. Our objective was to evaluate to which extent patient-speci c modelling in fluences treatment decisions in coarctation of the aorta (CoA), a common congenital heart disease. We selected three cases with CoA, two of which had borderline indications for intervention according to current clinical guidelines. The third case was not indicated for intervention according to guidelines. Foreach case, we generated two separate datasets. First dataset included conventional diagnostic parameters (echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging). In the second, we added modelled parameters (pressure elds). For the two cases with borderline indications for intervention, the second dataset also included pressure elds after virtual stenting simulations. All parameters were computed by modelling methods that were previously validated. In an online-administered, invitation-only survey, we randomized178 paediatric cardiologists to view (control) or add-on modelling (experimental) datasets. Primary endpoint was the proportion of participants recommending different therapeutic options: (1) surgery or catheter lab (collectively, \"intervention \") or (2) no intervention (follow-up with or without medication).

For the remaining case, there was no difference between the experimental and control group and the majority of participants recommended intervention. In sub-group analyses, ndings were not affected by the experience level of participating cardiologists. Despite existing clinical guidelines, the therapy recommendations of the participating physicians were heterogeneous. Validated patient-speci c computational modelling has the potential to in fluence treatment decisions. Future studies in broader areas are needed to evaluate whether differences in decisions result in improved outcomes (Trial Registration: NCT02700737). npj Digital Medicine (2019) 2:17 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-019-0085-1 INTRODUCTION Health systems are increasingly aiming to adopt precision medicine to better account for the well-characterized hetero-geneity among patient populations. 1In line with these goals, diagnostic methods, such as imaging, have improved substantiallyover the past years and are able to characterize patients at an everincreasing granularity. At the same time, recommendations inclinical practice guidelines led to major advances in evidence-based medicine. 2However, such guidelines are often inadequate to facilitate patient-centred care as they primarily aim tostandardize treatment and therefore account only partially forinter-individual variability. 3This often leaves clinicians with signi cant uncertainty when choosing the optimal treatment strategy. In coarctation of the aorta (CoA), a relatively common congenital heart disease, decisions on the timing and type oftreatment (wait vs. pharmacological treatment vs. intervention) are crucial to prevent long-term sequalae such as persistent arterial hypertension and end-organ damage.4However, recom- mendations do not always agree across different guidelines andthus leave room for debate, especially in clinically borderline cases. For example, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend intervention for primaryCoA or restenosis if invasive peak-to-peak pressure gradients across the CoA exceed 20 mmHg with or without signi cant narrowing. 5On the other hand, the European Society of Cardiology recommends interventional treatment if pressure gradients are higher than 20 mmHg based on cuff pressuresbetween upper and lower limbs in the presence of arterial hypertension. 6 Patient-speci c modelling has the potential to support indivi- dual therapy decisions and improve the success rate of Received: 24 October 2018 Accepted: 1 February 2019 1LSE Health, Department of Health Policy, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK;2German Heart Institute Berlin (DHZB), Berlin, Germany;3Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Pediatric Cardiology, Berlin, Germany;4DZHK (German Centre for Cardiovascular Research), partner site Berlin, Berlin, Germany;5Institute for Computational and Imaging Science in Cardiovascular Medicine, Charit\u00e9 -Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany;6Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London, London, UK;7Department of Sociology, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden and8Department of Methodology, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK Correspondence: Huseyin Naci (h.naci@lse.ac.uk)www.nature.com/npjdigitalmed Scripps Research Translational Instituteinterventions. For the evaluation of CoA, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) methods are of particular interest as they provide valuable information about hemodynamics such as pressure elds andflow pro les.7,8In addition, they can be coupled with virtual intervention tools such as stenting of the CoA or aortic valvereplacement which allow to predict the immediate hemodynamic effects of a given intervention.9,10Therefore, such models can provide diagnostic as well as prognostic information concerningthe hemodynamics before or after the simulated intervention. Inturn, availability of patient-speci c modelling data can reduce two key sources of uncertainty for clinical decision-making \u2014diagnosis and prognosis \u2014potentially in fluencing treatment recommendations. 11 Despite recent advances of such patient-speci c computational modelling concepts, the potential for clinical translation has not been subject to extensive evaluation. In recent years, there have been repeated calls to evaluate the effectiveness and cost- effectiveness of these approaches in larger populations.12,13 However, an important rst step is to evaluate their potential impact on clinician behaviour and decision making. Without demonstrable changes in clinicians 'treatment decisions as a result of improved information garnered through computational model- ling, subsequent changes in patient outcomes are unlikely. Our objective was to design and implement a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether and to what extent patient- speci c computational modelling in fluences clinical treatment decisions in a common congenital heart condition (CoA). To do so,we designed an experiment with different levels of data presented to cardiologists to assess whether viewing image-based, patient- speci c modelling altered the recommended course of action in hypothetical treatment scenarios. RESULTS Participant characteristicsFigure 1shows the flow of participants in the study. Of 2235 eligible clinicians invited to participate, 2039 did not respond; 15 did not meet the inclusion criteria (either participated in CARDIOPROOF or had no experience treating patients withcoarctation of the aorta over the past 6 months); and three did not give consent. A total of 178 cardiologists participated; 90 were randomly allocated to receive patient-speci c computational modelling data for the rst case (experimental) and 88 received conventional imaging parameters (control). After completing the questionnaire for the rst case, 6 participants left the study, leaving 172 participants for the second case. Another participant left the survey after completing the questionnaire for the second case. A total of 171 participants were randomized to the third case:92 and 79 participants were randomized to experimental and control groups, respectively. Participants in experimental and control arms of the trial had similar baseline characteristics. For the rst two cases, there were no detectable differences between the groups (Table 1). There were only a few statistically signi cant between-group differences for the third case. For example, 87.3% of participants in the controlgroup had over ve years of experience with decision making in congenital heart disease as compared to 71.4% of those in the experimental group ( p=0.01). Similarly, 88.8% of the participants in the control group had treatment experience on more than ve coarctation of the aorta cases in the past year as compared to 76.7% of those in the experimental group ( p=0.04). Outcomes Figure 2shows the recommended course of action for each case. For the rst case, overall, there was a statistically signi cant association between group assignment and recommended course of action ( p=0.00). For example, 70.5% of participants who were presented with patient-speci c modelling data in addition to conventional parameters recommended referring the patient to the catheter lab as compared to 36.7% of participants who were given conventional parameters alone. Fewer participants in theexperimental group recommended surgery compared to those inthe control group (23.9% vs. 35.6%, respectively). In addition, fewer participants in the experimental group recommended no intervention (leave untreated and follow-up, 2.3%; follow-up withmedication, 2.4%) compared to those in the control group (leave untreated and follow-up, 15.6%; follow-up with medication, 12.2%). For the second case, there was no discernible differencebetween the groups in terms of their recommended course ofaction ( p=0.92). A similar proportion of participants recom- mended referring the patient to the catheter lab (77.1% in treatment vs. 73.0% in control). A marginally statistically signi cant difference was observed between the two groups for the third case ( p=0.05). Findings of the primary analysis are shown in Table 2. A higher proportion of participants recommended an intervention (either surgery or catheter lab) when presented with patient-speci c modelling data in addition to conventional parameters for the rst case (borderline) and third case (non-borderline). For the rst case, 94.3% of participants in the experimental group recommended an intervention as opposed to 72.2% of those in the control group(relative risk, RR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.50, p=0.00); for the third case, 18.5% of participants in the experimental group and 5.1% of participants in the control group recommended an intervention (RR: 3.09, 95% CI: 1.17, 8.18, p=0.01). There was no statistically signi cant difference between the participants who were and were not presented with patient-speci c computational modelling data for the second case; 95.2% vs. 94.4% of those in theexperimental group recommended an intervention (RR: 1.00, 95%CI: 0.94, 1.07, p=0.82). Differences in the proportions of participants recommending either surgical intervention or catheter lab as opposed to no intervention (follow-up with or without medication) in experi- mental vs. control groups did not differ according to experiencelevel (Table 3). For example, more participants recommended an intervention for the rst case when they were presented with patient-speci c modelling data in addition to conventional parameters compared to participants presented with onlyconventional imaging data, regardless of whether they had more than 5 years of experience in congenital heart disease (RR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.49) or less than 5 years of experience (RR: 1.47, 95%CI: 1.10, 1.95).Eligible decision makers invited to participate (n=2,235)ExcludedDid not respond to invitation (n=2,039)Did not meet inclusion criteria (n=15) Did not give consent (n=3) Randomized to Case 1 (n=178) Allocation to treatment: 90 to control: 88 (analyzed) ExcludedLeft the survey Randomized Case 2 (n=172)Allocation to treatment: 83 (analyzed)Allocation to control: 91 (analyzed) Randomized Case (n=171)Allocation to treatment: 92 (analyzed)Allocation to control: 79 (analyzed)ExcludedLeft the survey (n=1) Fig. 1 Flow of participants in the trialH. Naci et al. 2 npj Digital Medicine (2019) 17 Scripps Research Translational Institute1234567890():,;DISCUSSION In this randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the treatment recommendations of physicians that were either based on currentstate-of-the-art diagnostic information or additional informationfrom patient-speci c computational models. We observed that despite existing clinical guidelines, the therapy recommendations of the participating physicians were quite heterogeneous for theindividual patients when based on \"conventional \"diagnostic information. Patient-speci c models appear to in fluence therecommended course of action. Cardiologists who were presented with computational modelling data in addition to conventionalechocardiography and MRI data were more likely to recommendsurgery or catheter intervention for two cases (one borderline andnon-borderline). These ndings were not affected by the experience level of the participating cardiologists. Research on the development of integrated computer models of the mechanical, physical and biochemical functions of a livinghuman body has drawn signi cant attention and has drivenTable 1.

Naci et al. 3 Scripps Research Translational Institute npj Digital Medicine (2019) 17 investment for the past decade.14-16This investment has been warranted on the premise that individualized risk prediction and virtual treatment planning have the potential to improve patient outcomes in many diseases.17Indeed, previous models raised signi cant expectations to make decision support tools available for early diagnosis, disease prediction and outcome optimization. Recent studies increasingly provide supporting evidence on the clinical reliability and validity of models emanating from theseresearch efforts.18-21 The applied models in our study were validated in previous work.7,8,10Uncertainties were addressed and it was shown that they can provide diagnostic information about pressure maps thatare equivalent to invasive cardiac catheterization.22,23In addition, it was shown that haemodynamic models after virtual treatment procedures can predict the hemodynamic effects of interven-tion.10In the present study, for both cases that received stent placement there was good agreement between predicted pressure drop and pressure drop measured by catheter post- intervention. However, investigated modelling methods are notmeant to replace evidence-based guidelines that are based uponmid- or long-term outcome data. Instead, the modelling methods allow simulating the immediate hemodynamic effects of an intervention and thus may help answering whether a givenintervention will provide hemodynamically meaningful results. This a-priori knowledge can be of clinical value, but such novel methods must be introduced into the clinical setting cautiously. It not only requires methods to be validated, but also to obtain knowledge about the impact of computational models on clinical decision-making process. This is what our trial starts to address. Currently, little is known about how clinicians comprehend and utilize new patient-speci c data, and whether this in fluences their treatment decisions. 24-26In this trial, we show that physicians who have access to patient-speci c modeling data make different treatment recommendations. These ndings are important to establish the decision impact of modelling data before investing in sizeable outcome trials in large patient populations. Future large trials should evaluate the appropriateness of making different treatment recommendations by mapping treatment decisions to mid-term and to long-term clinical outcomes. The design and ndings of our scenario-based randomized experi- ment can offer insights for future evaluations of computational modelling approaches. In accordance with what is widely known in clinical practice, we noted signi cant heterogeneity in decision making within each of the clinical cases. This result highlights the limitations of clinical guidelines in this area, despite their indisputable role in evidence- based medicine. In contrast, the use of the patient-speci c models can result in distinctive shifts in decisions. This underscores thepromises as well as the risks of computational models for personalized medicine. One can assume that it will be dif cult for a user to deviate from the recommendation of a model-based decision support system if it predicts a given effect of an intervention. Advocates of patient-speci c computational model- ling often argue that individualizing treatment strategies would optimize the type and timing of interventions, which in turn reduce unnecessary or inappropriate invasive procedures, and help realize substantial cost savings.27,28 How did patient-speci c modelling data in fluence treatment recommendations?

In our trial, we presented computational modelling data on both the diagnosis and prognosis for twocases (Cases 1 and 2), and only on the diagnosis for one case (Case3). Statistically signi cantly different recommendations were observed for Cases 1 and 3, indicating that it was reduced uncertainty \u2014irrespective of its source \u2014that was responsible for influencing treatment recommendations. In addition to the effect of reduced uncertainty, clinical decision making processes couldbe in fluenced by several other factors. These factors include participants 'experience, hospital-speci c practice, framing, search satiscing or even very subtle factors such as the scaling of the axes of graphs that have been extensively studied previously. 29-31 In our study we have presented the participants primarily CFD- based models since hemodynamic parameters such as the distribution of pressure gradients are particularly important for CoA. The CFD models have also the advantage that the results arerelatively easy to visualize for the user which is important for thestraightforward implementation of the trial. In addition, the CFDmodels can also be used together with tools that allow performingvirtual interventions. 9In the current study, we focused on virtual stent implantation to keep the experimental setup simple. Therepresentation of surgical interventions is technically also possible, 10but would have increased the complexity of the trial set-up. In contrast, models that allow to assess the patient-speci c response to pharmacological treatment are still under develop-ment and thus were also not used in our trial.Providing the participants of our study with simulations obtained after virtual stenting for the rst two cases may have primed them to consider the potential effects of stenting as opposed to other treatment alternatives. However, the proportionof participants who recommended referring patients to thecatheter lab was not higher for Case 2 despite the availability of virtual stenting information. In addition, more participants recommended intervention for Case 3 despite no virtual stentingdata presented for this case. These suggest that the priming effect of presenting virtual stenting data may be modest. Moreover, we cannot exclude that the presentation style of the pre-interventional hemodynamic results could have in fluenced the participants. For Case 3, the graph of the pre-interventional hemodynamics shows a sharp pressure drop across the stenosis. In addition, the x-axes had a limited range which could have implied a relatively large pressure drop. These could be reasonswhy participants with model-based information (compared to participants provided only with conventional information) recom- mended an intervention in this case, despite the fact that thepatient had no formal indication for intervention according to existing clinical guidelines. However, these explanations remain speculative. Therefore, future studies should be conducted thatassess systematically how speci c factors of modelling (including the presentation of modelling results) can shift decision in a given direction.Table 3.

Naci et al. 5 Scripps Research Translational Institute npj Digital Medicine (2019) 17 Thendings of our study should be interpreted in light of its limitations. We used data from three cases. Although a small number, these cases were carefully selected by experienced clinicians to demonstrate heterogeneity in clinical presentationand indication for intervention. Second, clearly this is an experimental study and we only considered hypothetical treat- ment decisions. It is conceivable that our study participantsdeviated from the types of decisions that they would have made in actual clinical settings. However, the extent to which their responses were affected by the hypothetical nature of ourexperiment should be similar in both the treatment and controlgroups, and therefore should not in fluence our ndings. In addition, generalizability of our ndings should be investigated further. Of 2235 cardiologists invited to take part in this study,2039 did not respond. Another key limitation of our study is its sample. Cardiologists who agreed to participate represent a selected sample of potential users of patient-speci c modelling approaches and may have a higher degree of knowledge and curiosity about modeling approaches. It is possible, therefore, participants of this trial had different attitudes towards innovativetechnologies (and hence treatment recommendations) than those who declined to take part. In conclusion, our randomized experiment provides insights into the potential feasibility and clinical utility of novel modelling approaches aimed at individualizing treatment decisions forcongenital heart conditions. This evaluation, despite focusing on a small number of cases, is nonetheless supportive of the use of individual patient computational modeling in arriving at a clinicaldecision. Whether observed differences in treatment decisionswould ultimately improve patient outcomes must be investigated in future studies. Larger randomized controlled trials are therefore needed to test the impact of using novel modelling approaches inreal-world clinical settings. METHODS Experimental and control groups We designed a randomized trial focused on CoA to examine the treatment decision impact on practicing cardiologists with experience in treating this condition when they were presented with additional data generated bypatient-speci c computational modelling. We generated two separate datasets for three actual clinical cases. The cases were selected by the clinical project partners in order to re flect clinical heterogeneity, amongst others with respect to age, vessel stenosis (location, degree and length) or presence of associated bicuspid aorticvalve. In addition, the selected cases represented differing levels ofborderline indication for intervention. Clinical details of the cases are shown in Fig. 3. We created two datasets for each case. In the rst dataset (control), we included conventional parameters (echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) currently recommended as standard diagnosticwork-up in clinical practice guidelines (see Table 4). In the second dataset (experimental), in addition to the parameters in the rst dataset, we included parameters obtained from clinically validated 7,8CFD-based patient-speci c modelling. The additional parameters included information about anatomy (geometry, vessel diameter and radius along the centre line) and function (aortic floweld and pressure drop along the centre line). The anatomy of the aorta was segmented using ZIB-Amira (ZuseInstitute Berlin, Germany). CFD simulations were based on four-dimensional phase contrast MRI data using Fluent (Version 14.5, ANSYS Inc., Canonsburg, PA, USA). A non-Newtonian blood model was used based on an adapted power law, while turbulence was accounted for by a k- SST turbulence model. For spatial discretization, high quality unstructuredvolume meshes were generated producing approximately one million cells for each patient. Results from flow simulations were validated against catheter measured pressure drop and flowelds measured by four- dimensional phase contrast MRI. We also presented virtual stenting data for the cases that had borderline indication for intervention. Virtual stenting was performed using a previously introduced interactive tool. 9Modelling parameters were presented for the pre-interventional state and a virtual post-interventional state (stenting of the aorta). In addition, applied models were veri ed to correctly predict pressure drop post-intervention. There was good agreement between modelled and invasive catheter- ization after stent placement for the two cases for which intervention was Fig. 3 Detailed presentation of casesH. Naci et al. 6 npj Digital Medicine (2019) 17 Scripps Research Translational Instituteindicated according to guidelines (10 vs 12 mmHg and 12 vs. 11 mmHg). The implanted stents did not vary in location, length or diametercompared to the virtual stents used within the simulations shown to theparticipants (Fig. 4). The remaining case did not receive any intervention, as formal guideline-based treatment indication was not ful lled. Only modelling information, but no clinical post-treatment images, were presented to the participants for this case. Clinicians who agreed to participate in the study received information about patient demographic characteristics (age, weight, height), history,symptoms, and clinical status (arterial blood pressure for all fourextremities, signs of heart failure, and exercise capacity) for each of thethree cases (see Supplementary Information for details). Whether studyparticipants received the rst or second dataset was dependent on their group allocation, as described below, as is the recruitment of participants. Trial design The randomized controlled trial design was used to minimise the potentialthreats to the internal validity of the study. We used a web-based surveyplatform (Qualtrics) to generate the random allocation sequence (qualtrics. com). Randomized allocation was therefore completed centrally andinvestigators could not foresee assignment. 32,33Given the nature of the intervention, participants were aware of experimental vs. control assign- ment. However, investigators remained unaware of group allocation untilafter trial completion. Randomization was at the case-level and was therefore repeated three times for each participant (i.e., each participant completed three randomized trials by the end of the study). Thus, it was possible for a trial participant to be randomized to the experimental group for one caseand the control group for another. It was also possible for a participant to be repeatedly randomized to the experimental or control group three times. This design ensured that most participants had an opportunity toview CFD simulations at least for some cases. Trial design is shown in Fig. 5. The target sample size was 118 (59 in each group) on the basis of an anticipated (hypothesized) effect size of 25% difference between the two groups in terms of the primary endpoint. Given the lack of similar evaluations in the literature, our hypothesized effect size was not based onprevious empirical studies. We anticipated that an estimated 40% of clinicians presented with the conventional set of parameters (control) as compared to an estimated 65% of clinicians presented with patient-speci c modelling parameters (experimental) would decide to recommend either surgery or catheter lab as opposed to follow-up with or without medication, giving an estimated effect size of 25%.Table 4.

Naci et al. 7 Scripps Research Translational Institute npj Digital Medicine (2019) 17 Practicing congenital, pediatric or interventional cardiologists were eligible for inclusion in the study if they had treated patients withcoarctation of the aorta during the past 6 months. Clinicians were noteligible to take part in the trial if they were af liated with the project team running the experiment, (the CARDIOPROOF consortium), or if they hadpilot-tested the questionnaire in its previous iterations. Pilot-testing wasconducted by cardiologist members of the CARDIOPROOF consortiumproject non-consortium members from partner institutions to ensurereadability and interpretability of the case summaries and accompanying questions. We considered participants to have more experience if they had >5 years of experience with decision making in congenital heart disease; >5coarctation of the aorta cases in the past year; and >5 catheterinterventions per year. Our recruitment strategy had two key elements. First, we manually searched and identi ed a list of practicing congenital, paediatric and interventional cardiologists in centres with experience in congenital heartdisease in Europe and North America. When then contacted them via e-mail. We also obtained access to the member lists of prominentorganizations including the Association for European Paediatric andCongenital Cardiology (AEPC). Second, we attended the AEPC Conferenceand invited eligible clinicians to participate in the experiment usinglaptops provided by the study team. To incentivize recruitment on site,participants were eligible to voluntarily enter a lottery to win a tablet device, and the CARDIOPROOF consortium made a donation of 10 Euros per participant to a charity organisation (Save the Children). We did notprovide any other remuneration to study participants. Survey implementation For the survey, the platform Qualtrics was used to administer the web-based questionnaire. 34Therst part of the questionnaire presented the clinicians with the study information sheet and asked for their informedconsent to take part in the experiment. The second part included a seriesof questions about participants 'experience level with decision making in congenital heart disease in general, and CoA in particular. Participantsindicating that they had no experience with treating patients with CoA were excluded at this stage. Remaining participants were then presented with the three cases, and depending on their group allocation, had accessto either the conventional parameters or patient-speci c computational modelling parameters. Questions pertaining to study endpoints thenfollowed (see below). At the end of the questionnaire, all participants wereasked about their demographic characteristics and geographic region ofpractice. In total, participants were able to complete the study inapproximately 20 min. Study questions were devised to explore participants 'willingness to recommend intervention in the presented cases depending on the typeof information presented to them (experimental vs. control). Partici-pants were r s ta s k e df o rt h e i rr e c o m m e n d e dc o u r s eo fa c t i o n . Available options were treating the patient with medication andfollow-up, leaving the patient untreated and following up, referringthe patient to the catheter lab, and referring the patient to surgery.The primary endpoint was \"decision to intervene \", referring to a clinician decision to recommend either surgery or catheter lab (collectively, \"intervention \") as opposed to follow-up with or without medication ( \"no intervention \"). Statistical analysis Werst used descriptive statistics to compare the experimental and control groups at baseline. Differences between study groups in terms ofoutcomes were then evaluated using Fisher 's exact test for proportions, and chi square analysis with categories adjusted to avoid cells with <5expected values. Statistical signi cance was de ned as a Pvalue of <0.05 assuming a two-tailed hypothesis. All analyzes were repeated for sub-groups according to experience level of participants. Statistical analyzeswere performed in STATA (version 14.2; STATA Corp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). The study was conducted in compliance with the London School of Economics and Political Science Research Ethics Policy and Code ofResearch Conduct. Due to the hypothetical nature of treatment decisionsmade as part of this experiment, the study was exempt from ethicsreview from the London School of Economics and Political ScienceResearch Ethics Committee through the self-certi cation pathway, andapproved by LSE Health. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. DATA AVAILABILITY The datasets generated during the current study are available from the correspond- ing author on reasonable request.
