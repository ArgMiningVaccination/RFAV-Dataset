As SG9R possesses an intact Salmonella plasmid with virulence genes, it exhibits dormant pathogenicity and can cause fowl typhoid in young chicks and stressed or immunocompromised brown egg-laying hens. To tackle these issues, we knocked out the rfaJ gene of SG9R (named Safe-9R) to eliminate the reversion risk and generated detoxified strains of Safe-9R by knocking out lpxL, lpxM, pagP, and phoP/phoQ genes to attenuate the virulence. Among the knockout strains, live lpxL- (Dtx-9RL) and lpxM-9R (Dtx-9RM) strains induced remarkably less expression of inflammatory cytokines in chicken macrophage cells, and oil emulsion (OE) Dtx-9RL did not cause body weight loss in chicks. Live Dtx-9RM exhibited efficacy against field strain challenge in one week without any bacterial re-isolation, while the un-detoxified strains showed the development of severe liver lesions and re-isolation of challenged strains. Thus, SG9R was optimally detoxified by knockout of lpxL and lpxM, and Dtx-9RL and Dtx-9RM might be applicable as OE and live vaccines, respectively, to prevent fowl typhoid irrespective of the age of chickens.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-02-03", "cleaned_text": "Optimized Detoxification of a Live Attenuated Vaccine Strain (SG9R) to Improve Vaccine Strategy against Fowl Typhoid [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9020122](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9020122) [Analysis and Modification of Existing Vaccines for the Vaccines]( /journal/vaccines/special_issues/Next-Generation_vaccines )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00122), [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00122)]. SG9R was transformed into a rough strain by a nonsense mutation in the rfaJ gene [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00122)]. However, the fact that the attenuation is attributable to only a single point mutation continues to raise concerns regarding pathogenic reversion. Previous studies have demonstrated that the field-isolated SG from SG9R inoculated farms exhibits the same DNA fingerprint as SG9R, and several SG9R-like rough strains have been reported [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00122), [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00122), [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00122)]. SG9R not only has the potential to restore pathogenicity, but also has residual pathogenicity of its own. It can be transmitted vertically, and mortality and re-isolation can occur if there is immune suppression by insufficient nutrition or infection by immunosuppressive pathogens [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00122), [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00122)]. As SG9R inoculation decreases the growth rate in young chicks, SG9R vaccination has usually been recommended after 6 weeks of age, resulting in the lack of implementation of proper measures to protect against FT during the most susceptible period [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00122), [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00122)]. [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00122)]. Presence of the Salmonella endotoxin decreases body weight in broiler chickens, and lipid A is at the core of the toxic moiety [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00122), [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00122)]. To detoxify lipid A, multiple enzymes involved in the modification of a lipid A precursor, lipid IVA, have been targeted in Escherichia coli and Salmonella serovar Typhimurium [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00122), [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00122)]. When the lpxL or lpxM gene is removed, the penta-acyl chain is generated, and the double mutant of lpxL and lpxM harbors tetra-acylated lipid A of lpxL and lpxM mutants express reduced toxicity of LPS, resulting in the attenuation of virulence. These attenuated bacteria showed potential as vaccine candidates [ [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00122), [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00122)]. It is challenging to achieve an optimal attenuation of the SG vaccine, for induction of sufficient protection efficacy against the fatal field strain, and to circumvent mortality and persistent infection in young chicks and immunocompromised chickens. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Bacteria and Experimental Birds [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00122)]. The bacteria were cultured in Luria Bertani (LB) broth (Duchefa Biochemie, Groot Bijgaarden, Belgium) by incubating under shaking conditions (250 rpm) at 37 \u00b0C overnight aerobically. 2.2. Generation of Knockout Mutant Strains [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00122)]. Briefly, for homologous recombination, the homology arms were amplified via PCR by attaching oligonucleotides to target the genes ( [Supplementary Table S1](#app1-vaccines-09-00122)). The Red/ET plasmid and amplified homology SG9R or Safe-9R using an GenePulser Xcell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at 2500 V, 10 F, and 600 with 1 mm slit Gene Pulser cuvettes (Bio-Rad). Transformed bacteria were selected using extracted DNA was sequenced using the HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and the filtered data were mapped using BWA version 0.7.12 to NC_011274.1) in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. The genes that differed between Safe-9R and SG9R were identified. 2.4. Detection of Pro-Inflammatory levels each pro-inflammatory cytokine were compared using the 2 -Ct method. 2.5. Growth Temperature Sensitivity Test 2.6. Analysis of Protective Efficacy and Toxicity of Safe-9R [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00122)]. 2.7. Assessment of Humoral Immunity and Weight Gain after Administration of OE Vaccines of Detoxified Strains [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00122)]. OE vaccines were inoculated into 1 and 2 week-old chicks, and the body weight was measured weekly for 2 weeks after vaccination. 2.8. Evaluation of Protection Efficacy and Pathogenicity of Live Detoxified Vaccines [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00122)]. 2.9. Assessment of T-Cell Stimulation by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting 2.10. Statistical Analysis 3. Results 3.1. Generation of Safe-9R [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00122-f001)A). We named the rfaJ knockout strain Safe-9R and compared its genome sequences with those of SG9R by re-sequencing. There were no differences except for the rfaJ gene (data not shown). 3.2. Generation and Characterization of Gene Knockout Strains for Detoxification [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00122-f001)B). The toxic effects of the knockout strains were compared using reverse transcription quantitative PCR of IL-1, IL-18, levels were not significantly different between the knockout strain-infected HD-11 cells and uninfected HD-11 cells. However, the and iNOS mRNA levels of phoP/Q- and pagP-knockout strains, and Safe-9R were significantly higher than those of lpxL- and lpxM-knockout strains (named Dtx9RL and Dtx-9RM, respectively), and the negative control. Only Safe-9R showed significantly higher TLR-4 mRNA levels than the negative control ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-09-00122-f002)). Therefore, live Dtx9RL and Dtx-9RM were successfully detoxified and did not induce the transcription of IL-1, IL-18, iNOS, and TLR-4 genes. Immunogenicity of Safe-9R [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00122-t001)). Although the survival rate of one out of the three experiments confirmed significance, the OE Safe-9R vaccination in 1 week-old chicks protected against mortality in fatal challenge at 2 wpv. However, the OE Safe-9R vaccination did not protect from mortality at 7 wpv and even showed lower survival rates in vaccinated than unvaccinated groups in two (50 versus 90 and 70 versus 90) out of the three experiments ( [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00122-t001)). Interestingly, anti-OmpA and anti-OmpX antibody levels in the vaccinated group at 2 wpv were significantly higher than those of the unvaccinated group, similar to the anti-OMP antibody levels ( [Figure 3](#vaccines-09-00122-f003)). However, only the anti-OMP antibody level in the vaccinated group at 7 wpv was significantly higher than that of the negative control group ( [Figure 3](#vaccines-09-00122-f003)). 3.4. In Vivo Verification of Detoxification [Figure 4](#vaccines-09-00122-f004)B). To differentiate body weight changes between detoxified strains, we performed the same experiment using 1 w-o chicks and including SG9R. The body weight of Dtx-9RL-vaccinated chicks was not significantly different from that of the negative control, but body weights of chicks vaccinated with Dtx-9RM, Safe-9R, and SG9R were significantly less than those of the negative control. Therefore, detoxification of Dtx-9RL was apparent in the 1 w-o chick body weight model ( [Figure 4](#vaccines-09-00122-f004)A). [Figure 5](#vaccines-09-00122-f005)). 3.6. Evaluation of Residual Pathogenicity and Efficacy Live Detoxified Strains [Table 2](#vaccines-09-00122-t002)). [Table 3](#vaccines-09-00122-t003)). The lesion is demonstrated in [Figure S1](#app1-vaccines-09-00122). When the field strain was challenged at 1 wpv, bacteria were re-isolated from all the groups except Dtx-9RM-vaccinated group and they were identified to be the smooth challenge strain. When challenged at 2 wpv, only the rough vaccine strain was re-isolated showed significantly higher percentage of CD8+ T cells in PBMCs collected at 1 wpv compared to those observed in the negative control. Safe-9R-vaccinated, and Dtx-9RM- and SG9R-vaccinated groups showed significantly higher percentages of CD8+ T cells than those of the negative group at 1week post-challenge (wpc) and 2 wpc, respectively ( [Figure of the vaccinated groups, and SG9R- and Dtx-9RM-vaccinated groups showed a significantly higher percentage of CD4+ T cells than the negative control group at 1 wpc and 2 wpc, respectively ( [Figure 7](#vaccines-09-00122-f007)B). 4. Discussion [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00122), [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00122)]. The underlying reason for SG vaccines showing cross-protective efficacy to SE may be attributed to the intimate genetic relationship between SG and SE, and the competitive exclusion of SE by SG [ [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00122), [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00122)]. Since SG9R was permitted for use in commercial layer farms in 2001, food poisoning cases caused by SE have decreased gradually in Korea. In broiler chickens which are not permitted for vaccination, frequent FT outbreaks and SE isolation have been reported [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00122), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00122)]. In the EU, SG9R was used to reduce food poisoning cases caused by SE, until FT outbreaks were reported in SG9R-vaccinated layer farms [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00122)]. Although field pathogenic isolates originating from SG9R due to a single point mutation in rfaJ has never been reported, SG9R has been shown to cause FT in immunocompromised flocks [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00122), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00122)]. Therefore, removal of this reversion risk and maintenance of protective efficacy without residual pathogenicity are crucial for successful SG9R vaccination. [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00122)]. However, these specific antibodies disappeared at 7 wpv ( [Figure 3](#vaccines-09-00122-f003)). The correlation of higher anti-OmpA and anti-OmpX antibodies with protective efficacy may highlight their immunoprotective roles. Even though significantly high anti-OMP antibody levels were apparent at 7 wpv, this observation did not highlight efficacy or showed even worse outcomes than the control group. This observation may be reminiscent of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), which is defined as the suppression of host defense by the immune complex composed of specific IgG and antigen, and the possibility of ADE in Salmonella has been reported [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00122)]. Therefore, further studies on the protective efficacy of subunit vaccines composed of OmpA and OmpX epitopes and the relation of OMP antibodies against ADE should be conducted. The negative effect of OE Safe-9R on the body weight of young chicks necessitates the development of increased detoxified vaccine strains. [Figure 2](#vaccines-09-00122-f002)). The detoxification levels of Dtx-9RL and Dtx-9RM and body weight of 2 week-old chicks were indistinguishable in the in vitro model, but they were clearly differentiated by the body weight in 1 week-old chicks ( [Figure 4](#vaccines-09-00122-f004)). To date, endotoxins are known to cause reductions in the body weight of chickens, and we demonstrated that knockout of lpxL was the best strategy to eliminate these side effects [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00122)]. [Table 4](#vaccines-09-00122-t004)). This was an unexpected result and might be attributed to early infection by the field strain after the vaccination. Our previous study demonstrated that competition between field strains with different pathogenicity might result in the dominant isolation of more pathogenic strains over time [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00122)]. Therefore, the pathogenicity of Safe-9R and SG9R may not be overcome by the host immunity within 1 wpv and subsequent challenge may result in the development of more severe lesions and predominant persistent infection by more pathogenic challenge strains. Considering no re-isolation of challenged smooth strains from Safe-9R- and SG9R-vaccinated groups when challenged at 2 wpv, they may require a longer length of time for full protection. However, the protective efficacy of live Dtx-9RM was demonstrated in terms of the bacterial re-isolation rate and the severity of lesions, and the priming of mucosal immunity by Dtx-9RM\u2014similar to that observed with and SG9R\u2014was also demonstrated ( [Figure 6](#vaccines-09-00122-f006)) [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00122)]. Additionally, the better protective efficacy of live Dtx-9RM vaccine can be supported by the significantly higher CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses after vaccination and challenge ( [Figure 7](#vaccines-09-00122-f007)). The protective efficacy of the live Dtx-9RL vaccine was not enough, showing similar mortality to the negative control and Dtx-9RL seemed to be over attenuated. [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00122), [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00122)]. Therefore, different chemical structures may be variably sensed by the innate and acquired immune systems of chickens. According to previous reports, in contrast to lpxM, defects in lpxL resulted in reduced phagocyte resistance and detoxified reaction [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00122), [32](#B32-vaccines-09-00122)]. Therefore, the in vivo tests performed in this study may be useful strategies to differentiate lpxL- and lpxM-knockout mutants. The attenuation of Dtx-9RL and Dtx-9RM can also be explained by the reduced growth rate at the normal body temperature of chickens at 42 \u00b0C. The vulnerability of the lpxL mutant to high growth temperatures has already been reported in E. coli and Salmonella serovar Typhimurium, but we observed a similar effect of the lpxM-knockout mutation in SG [ [33](#B33-vaccines-09-00122), [34](#B34-vaccines-09-00122)]. 5.
