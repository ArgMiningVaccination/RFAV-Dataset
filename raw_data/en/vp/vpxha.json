Office of Patient Centered Ca re & Cultural Transformation March 2020 WELCOME Welcome to the Whole Health for Mental Health course! This course is brought to you by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation (OPCC&CT), which was established in 2011 to lead one of the most massive changes in the philosophy and process for care delivery ever undertaken by an organized health care system . Whole Health is included within VA's strategic goals for 2019 -2024, and Whole Health Systems are now under development in all 18 VISNs, with rapid and successful spread to all VA sites being the ultimate goal. The Whole Health approach for any given Veteran is built around his or her values. What matters most? Why do they want to be healthy in the first place? Focusing on someone's mission, aspiration, and purpose engages them. Teams can empower and equip Veterans with the tools they need to reach their goals. The Whole Health approach builds on the successes of other programs and offers an overarching philosophy that can inform any type of patient care. It applies to inpatient and outpatient, for acute and chronic conditions. This is true whether those conditions are considered \"mental\" or \"physical\"; in fact, this course focuses on how that divide may not be useful when it comes to optimally taking care of people. Incorporating the Whole Health framework requires a paradigm shift from problem -based, disease- focused care to Whole Health Care, which is a more expansive and inclusive model. This course is designed to help you, someone who participates in mental health care for Veterans, to take part in that paradigm shift. VA defines Whole Health as patient- centered care that affirms the importance of the partnership between the clinician and the patient. The focus is on the whole person. It involves co -creating a personalized, proactive, and patient- driven experience. It is informed by evidence and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, health care professionals, and disciplines to achieve optimal health and well -being. As they move through the Whole Health System, Veterans are encouraged to complete a Personal Health Inventory (PHI), a tool that helps them reflect on their values, priorities, self-care goals, and their vision of what it means to live life fully. Using information from the PHI and other assessment tools, and based on shared patient and clinician goals, a Personal Health Plan (PHP) is co -created by the Veteran and their care team. The plan is evidence- based. It is built upon self -care and empowerment for the individual; it enlists both conventional and complementary approaches as appropriate; and it leverages support systems inside VA and in the community. The PHP follows Veterans through the system and, ideally, can draw Whole Health into every aspect of their care. We wish you well as you explore how the Whole Health approach can support you in your practice, your broader team, your department, your facility, and even the health care system in general. The intent is that this course can also support you with your own self - care and connect you back to why you chose to be a health care professional in the first place. Thank you for joining us! WHOLE HEALTH FOR MENTAL HEALTH \u2014PARTICIPANT WORKBOOK 4 VA Office of Patient Centered C are & Cultural Transf ormation March 2020 ABOUT THE COURSE Whole Health for Mental Health explores how Whole Health can support mental health care in the VA. This two -day course shifts the perspective away from mind -body dualism and toward a system of care where mental health is seamlessly incorporated as a core aspect of whole -person care. The course highlights the connections between mental health (and Power of the Mind) and each of the components of the Circle of Health, including mindful awareness and the various aspects of self -care (e.g. Food and Drink, Moving the Body, Surroundings, Spirit and Soul, Personal Development, Recharge, and Family, Friends, and Co-Workers). It focuses on the importance of professional care provided by well -informed, carefully -coordinated transdisciplinary teams. Course participants discuss the latest research in complementary and integrative health (CIH) related to mental health care within a broader context. They learn about resources that can inform \"Whole Mental Health,\" and they explore how to overcome the stigma that often surrounds mental health conditions and their treatment. In short, this course is designed to help clinicians bridge mental health care with every other aspect of Veterans' lives. Whole Health for Mental Health is designed for clinicians who support Veterans who have mental health conditions. It is intended to support anyone who would like to focus more on \"Power of the Mind\" as they are helping Veterans create PHPs, including Whole Health Partner s. The course focuses on prevention of mental health problems as well as their treatment. Whole Health for Mental Health draws from the group wisdom of participants and gives them the opportunity to network, share their successes and challenges, and explore how to make care in VA even better. The course is built upon innovative approaches that are already being used by some clinicians to support mental health and health in general. An individualized approach to care that is based on a person's core values is central, and the course draws in positive psycholog y, the recovery model, psychotherapeutic approaches, posttraumatic growth, and the best that conventional care and CIH have to offer. During this course, y ou are invited to: Help lead the charge with advancing Whole Health Care in VA. See why VA is specially suited to advancing Whole Mental Health in ways that will inform future directions for the entire U.S. health care system. Explore how you can make the care of Veterans even better, in terms of preventing and addressing mental health conditions, and in terms of whole -person care. Bridge, and perhaps even reconcile, the mind -body divide, exploring how care can shift if we reframe our perspectives on the interconnections between mental and other aspects of health. Receive evidence- based tools and information related to Whole Health for yourself, your patients, and your co -workers. Share your experiences and your wisdom with your colleagues as you join the ranks of your local\u2014and national \u2014Whole Health community. WHOLE HEALTH FOR MENTAL HEALTH \u2014PARTICIPANT WORKBOOK 5 VA Office of Patient Centered Ca re & Cultural Transformation March 2020 Take time to pause and focus on what you need to take care of yourself and others. What do you need for your Whole Health? How are you doing in terms of resilience, emotional well -being, and addressing stress? What would support your own mental health? Course Learning Objectives Explore the pow er of the Whole Health approach when it comes to working with mental health conditions, moving beyond models that treat mind and body as separate. Demonstrate how all the areas of the Circle of Health are relevant for mental health. This may include preventing mental health challenges, building mental health skills, and addressing mental health conditions, such as PTSD, depression and other mood disorders, substance use, psychoses, suicide, and other mental health -related conditions. Focus on the importance of transdisciplinary teams for supporting mental health, including programs that integrate mental health professionals into primary care and other teams. Explore evidence- informed use of integrative care to support mental health. Gain familiarity with a number of tools and skills that can support Whole Mental Health. Explore how what you learn about Whole Health can benefit your own self -care and mental well -being. Confidently incorporate Whole Health into your clinical work, as appropriate for your sc ope of practice. Empower Veterans to build or elaborate upon their PHPs, both in relation to their mental health concerns as well as their overall health. Make care more values -driven, honoring what really matters to each Veteran and engaging them in their care as fully as possible.

WHOLE HEALTH FOR MENTAL HEALTH \u2014PARTICIPANT WORKBOOK 17 VA Office of Patient Centered Ca re & Cultural Transformation March 2020 Where You Are and Where You Would Like to Be For each area below, consider \"Where you are\" and \"Where you want to be.\" Write in a number between 1 (low) and 5 (high) that best represents where you are and where you want to be. You do not need to be a \"5\" in any of the areas now, nor even wish to be a \"5\" in the future. Areas of Whole Health Where I am Now (1-5) Where I Want to Be (1-5) Moving the Body: Our physical, mental, and emotional health are impacted by the amount and kind of movement we do. Moving the body can take many forms such as dancing, walking, gardening, yoga, and exercise. 3 5 Recharge: Our bodies and minds must rest and recharge in order to optimize our health. Getting a good night's rest as well as recharging our mental and physical energy throughout the day are vital to well-being. Taking short breaks or doing something you enjoy or feels good for moments throughout the day are examples of ways to refresh. 1 3 Food and Drink: What we eat and drink can have a huge effect on how we experience life, both physically and mentally. Energy, mood, weight, how long we live, and overall health are all impacted by what and how we choose to eat and drink. 2 5 Personal Development: Our health is impacted by how we choose to spend our time. Aligning our work and personal activities with what really matters to us, or what brings us joy, can have a big effect on our health and outlook on life. 2 4 Family, Friends, and Co -Workers: Our r elationships, including those with pets, have as significant an effect on our physical and emotional health as any other factor associated with well-being. Spending more time in relationships that 'fuel' us and less in relationships that 'drain' us is one potential option. Improving our relationship skills or creating new relationships through community activities are other options to consider. 4 5 Spirit and Soul: Connecting with something greater than ourselves may provide a sense of meaning and purpose, peace, or comfort. Connecting and aligning spiritually is very individual and may take the form of religious affiliation, connection to nature, or engaging in things like music or art. 2 5 Surroundings: Our surroundings, both at work and where we live, indoors and out, can affect our health and outlook on life. Changes within our control such as organizing, decluttering, adding a plant or artwork can improve mood and health. 3 5 Power of the Mind: Our thoughts are powerful and can affect our physical, m ental, and emotional health. Changing our mindset can aid in healing and coping. Breathing techniques, guided imagery, Tai Chi, yoga, or gratitude can buffer the impact of stress and other emotions 0 5 Professional Care: \"Prevention and Clinical Care\" Staying up to date on prevention and understanding your health concerns, care options, treatment plan, and their role in your health 3 4 Reflections Now that you have thought about what matters to you in all of these areas, what is your vision of your bes t possible self? What would your life look like? What kind of activities would you be doing? I have a hard time just getting through the day and night sometimes. I would be happier and able to relax. I would take better care of myself. I would have a job I like. No nightmares. Clear thinking. Would like to go back to school some day to get an MBA, but there is no way I could handle that right now. Are there any areas you would like to work on? Where might you start? With the pain and everything, it is hard. I hate my job. I want to get the spark back with my wife and exercise more. I stress eat. I smoke too much. I'd just like to feel good, for once. After completing the Personal Health Inventory, talk to a friend, a family member, your health coach, a peer, or someone on your healthcare team about areas you would like to explore further.

I would be able to sleep instead of waking up worrying. I would have a dog, or maybe even a boyfriend. I would h ave \"Power of my Mind\" - don't know what that is. I have wondered about getting more spiritual, but I don't want to be kidnapped by a cult. I love to be active, but it is hard in my little a partment. Are there any areas you would like to work on? Where m ight you start? I want to reach a point where I can feel brave enough to go see my nieces in person instead of just Skyping. I would be in control of my fear and be able to trust that my body is as healthy as my nurse practitioner keeps saying it is. I would driv e. I would leave the house to go shopping, inst ead of ordering everything online .

You do not need to be a \"5\" in any of the areas now, nor even wish to be a \"5\" in the fu ture. Areas of Whole Health Where I am Now (1-5) Where I Want to Be (1-5) Moving the Body: Our physical, mental, and emotional health are impacted by the amount and kind of movement we do. Moving the body can take many forms such as dancing, walking, gardening, yoga, and exercise. Recharge: Our bodies and minds must rest and recharge in order to optimize our health. Getting a good night's rest as well as recharging our mental and physical energy throughout the day are vital to well-being. Taking short breaks or doing something you enjoy or feels good for moments throughout the day are examples of ways to refresh. Food and Drink: What we eat and drink can have a huge effect on how we experience life, both physically and mentally. Energy, mood, weight, how long we live, and overall health are all impacted by what and how we choose to eat and drink. Personal Development: Our health is impacted by how we choose to spend our time. Aligning our work and personal activities with what really matters to us, or what brings us joy, can have a big effect on our health and outlook on life. Family, Friends, and Co -Workers: Our relationships, including those with pets, have as significant an effect on our physical and emotional health as any other factor associated with well-being. Spending more time in relationships that 'fuel' us and less in relationships that 'drain' us is one potential option. Improving our relationship skills or creating new relationships through community activities are other options to consider. Spirit and Soul: Connecting with something greater than ourselves may provide a sense of meaning and purpose, peace, or comfort. Connecting and aligning spiritually is very individual and may take the form of religious affiliation, connect ion to nature, or engaging in things like music or art. Surroundings: Our surroundings, both at work and where we live, indoors and out, can affect our health and outlook on life. Changes within our control such as organizing, decluttering, adding a plant or artwork can improve mood and health. Power of the Mind: Our thoughts are powerful and can affect our physical, mental, and emotional health. Changing our mindset can aid in healing and coping. Breathing techniques, guided imagery, Tai Chi, yoga, or gratitude can buffer the impact of stress and other emotions Professional Care: \"Prevention and Clinical Care\" Staying up to date on prevention and understanding your health concerns, care options, treatment plan, and their role in your health Reflections Now that you have thought about what matters to you in all of these areas, what is your vision of your best possible self? What would your life look like? What kind of activities would you be doing? _________________________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________________ Are t here any areas you would like to work on? Where might you start? _________________________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________________ After completing the Personal Health Inventory, talk to a friend, a family member, your health coach, a peer, or someone on your healthcare team about areas you would like to explore further.
