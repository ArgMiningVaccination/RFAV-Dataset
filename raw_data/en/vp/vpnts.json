As an MIT student, you can use most of the services at MIT Medical with no out-of-pocket cost \u2014 services like Urgent Care, Primary Care, Mental Health & Counseling, and many more are included with tuition. This guide provides the basic information you need to know to start getting your healthcare at MIT Medical. You can find more detailed information on our website at medical.mit.edu . 1. Remember: Healthcare at MIT Medical is included with tuition. It doesn't matter if you waived MIT's Student Health Insurance Plan (MIT SHIP) or have MIT SHIP coverage. Either way, you can get your care at MIT Medical with no copays or unexpected bills. You don't have to pay for the care you receive from most services including Urgent Care, Primary Care, Sports Medicine, or other specialty services. You will have no fee for laboratory tests analyzed in our lab or for X-rays. In other cases, such as acupuncture, you will only need to pay $10 per visit. 2. You can get same-day care if you are sick or hurt. MIT Medical's Urgent Care Service is on the first floor of MIT Medical and does not require an appointment. You can walk in, check in at the front desk, and wait for an available clinician. Or you can use the online form (medical.mit.edu/reserve) to reserve a time to come in and be seen. Urgent Care is open from 8 a.m.-8 p.m. Monday-Friday and 8 a.m.-4 p.m. on weekends and most holidays. All of MIT Medical \u2014 including Urgent Care \u2014 will be closed on January 1, July 4, Thanksgiving Day, and December 25. Instead of Urgent Care, you might also be able to have a same-day appointment in Primary Care or a telehealth appointment. If you prefer one of those options, call 617-253-4481 to speak with a nurse. The nurse will give you advice about what to do next. 3. Make an appointment to get other kinds of care. Except for Urgent Care, you will need an appointment to see a clinician at MIT Medical. For example, if you need a check-up, a vaccine, or a prescription, or if you have a medical concern that is not urgent, you should make an appointment to see a provider in Primary Care. We will always make sure you can see a clinician quickly if you have an urgent need, but you may need to wait some weeks to see a clinician for routine, non-urgent care \u2014 so plan ahead. To make a Primary Care appointment, call 617-258-9355 and tell us what you need. We will help you make the right kind of appointment with the right clinician. You can also make appointments directly with other services at MIT Medical \u2014 like Sports Medicine & Orthopedics, OB/Gyn, or Student Mental Health & Counseling. 4. Sign up for HealthELife . HealthELife is MIT Medical's online patient portal. You can use HealthELife to request appointments, send messages to your healthcare providers, have a video visit with a clinician, or view your test results and medical records. Sign up with the online form (mitmedical.iqhealth.com/self- enroll) or ask one of our staff members to send you an invitation by email. 5. Stop by MedStop to get over-the-counter medications at lower prices. Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are medications you can purchase without a prescription, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, allergy medications, and more. The least expensive option for OTC medications is at the MedStop kiosk on the first floor of MIT Medical, next to the Urgent Care check-in desk. You can buy lots of different medications at MedStop, and the prices are lower than in a pharmacy or supermarket.QUICKSTART GUIDE: THE BASICS OF GETTING YOUR CARE AT MIT MEDICAL4 MIT MEDICAL SERVICES AND OTHER RESOURCES Urgent Care MIT Medical's Urgent Care Service, on the first floor of MIT Medical, provides same-day care when you are sick or hurt but it is not a life-threatening emergency. Urgent Care is the place to go for things like minor burns or small cuts, rashes, headaches, fever, nausea and vomiting, urinary tract infections, sprains or possible minor fractures, and other medical concerns that need quick attention. You do not need an appointment to be seen in Urgent Care. You can walk in, check in at the front desk, and wait for an available clinician. Or you can use the online form (medical.mit.edu/reserve) to reserve a time to come in and be seen. Urgent Care is open from 8 a.m.-8 p.m. Monday-Friday and 8 a.m.-4 p.m. on weekends and most holidays. All of MIT Medical \u2014 including Urgent Care \u2014 will be closed on January 1, July 4, Thanksgiving Day, and December 25. WHAT IF IT'S AN EMERGENCY? If you have a life-threatening medical emergency \u2014 like a very bad injury, a serious allergic reaction, or trouble breathing \u2014 do not call MIT Medical or come to Urgent Care. If you are on campus, call the MIT Police at 617-253-1212 . They can send an ambulance or other help faster than if you call 911. If you are not on campus, dial 911.7. We will provide an interpreter when you need one . We provide interpreter services for more than 150 spoken languages and American Sign Language (ASL). When you visit MIT Medical, you can use a remote interpreter through an iPad or the telephone. For a regular, weekday appointment: Use our online form (medical.mit.edu/interpreter) to request an interpreter in advance. The interpreter will be ready to begin when you arrive. You can also ask for an interpreter when you check in or at any time during your appointment. For an Urgent Care visit: Ask for an interpreter at the desk when you check in. For a phone call: When you call, just say, \"I need an interpreter, \" and tell us the language you need. We will put you on hold while we add an interpreter to the call. 5 Primary Care MIT Medical's primary care providers (PCPs) offer routine healthcare to patients of all ages. The Primary Care Service is where you'll go if you want to schedule a physical exam, need a vaccine, or have a non-urgent health problem or concern. Our PCPs can order lab tests, write prescriptions, and help you manage chronic conditions, like seasonal allergies or diabetes. You can choose a nurse practitioner or physician in our Primary Care Service to be your campus care provider, or personal clinician, while you are here at MIT . But you can use Primary Care even if you haven't chosen a PCP . You can make an appointment with any PCP who is available. Sometimes, you might be able to have your appointment, or part of your appointment, via telehealth. During a telehealth visit, the clinician can discuss your symptoms with you and evaluate visible conditions like rashes or minor injuries. They can also prescribe medications or order bloodwork or other tests. In some cases, you may follow up with a clinician in person for a physical examination. If you have chosen a PCP , you can request an appointment through our online portal, HealthELife. Otherwise, call the Primary Care Service at 617-258-9355. Tell us as much as you can about why you are making the appointment, so we can make sure to schedule an appointment of the right length and determine if a telehealth appointment is a possibility. Student Mental Health & Counseling Services Life at MIT can be fast paced and demanding. Many students find that it helps to talk with someone about relationship challenges, feeling overwhelmed by school, issues at home, loneliness, anxiety, depression, or other concerns. MIT Medical's Student Mental Health & Counseling Services can help. You can choose to talk privately with a clinician in person or via telehealth, or, if appropriate, join one of our support or therapy groups. To get started, use our online form (medical.mit.edu/SMHCSappt) to schedule an initial call with a clinician. During that call, the provider will ask you about your concerns, so we can schedule you for an appointment with a clinician that will meet your needs. If you have an urgent concern, call us at 617-253-2916. When you call, you can speak with a clinician who will help you to figure out what to do next. Clinicians are on call and available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for urgent consultations. GETTING THE MOST OUT OF YOUR APPOINTMENT Here are a few tips to make your in-person or telehealth appointment go smoothly: If you have a specific health concern, it might help to keep a record of your symptoms and bring it with you to the appointment. Prepare a list of questions ahead of time, so you can remember everything you want to ask. Talk about your most important concerns first. Ask questions if you don't understand something. It's important that you understand any plans for treatment or follow-up. If you think of a question after your appointment, you can call, or send your clinician a message through HealthELife. Be honest. Clinicians won't be shocked or surprised by anything you say or ask. And remember, they may have to ask personal questions to give you the right kind of care. Be prepared to make a follow-up appointment if necessary. Remember that you can ask for an interpreter at any time during an appointment .6 Eye Service The Eye Service is available for eye exams and can also diagnose and treat eye injuries or other urgent eye issues.

What if I don't? Your visits to MIT Medical and the information you share with our providers are confidential. That means that every part of every visit is kept private. Unless you give us permission, we won't share any of your health information with your parents, professors, or friends. Exceptions to this policy would be life-threatening situations, or if you are under the age of 18. If you do want your parents involved in your care at some point, just tell us. Speak with your provider directly, and give them permission to speak with your parents about that specific episode of care. You can only give permission for a specific episode of care \u2014 it's not blanket permission to discuss any of your other visits or medical issues. This permission expires when the specific episode of care is resolved or in six months if the episode of care is ongoing. If you want your parents involved again, you'll need to provide permission again. I'm on my parent's insurance plan. Does this affect the confidentiality of my care? Not at MIT Medical, but maybe elsewhere. We don't send information to your parents about your visits at MIT Medical. But if you use your parent's insurance plan for services outside MIT Medical, like filling prescriptions or seeing outside specialists, your parents might get a bill. Even if an outside visit is fully covered by your parents' insurance, and there is no bill, your parents may see any notices or claim summaries the insurance company sends to your home address.PRIVACY AT MIT MEDICAL LGBTQ+ health services include hormonal therapy for transgender students, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and comprehensive primary care from knowledgeable and caring providers.

To find your resident MedLink , visit medlinks.mit.edu.8 USING YOUR INSURANCE We can care for many of your medical needs on campus, and visits to most specialists at MIT Medical are also covered as part of your tuition. This coverage is not the same thing as an insurance policy. If you need to go to the emergency room or visit an outside specialist or facility, that visit will be billed to your comprehensive insurance plan. Keep your insurance ID card with you at all times. If you have MIT SHIP , you can download your insurance card to your smartphone. If you waived the MIT Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) If you have comprehensive insurance through another insurance company, you will need to find out if the specialist you want to see is part of your insurance company's network and make sure your insurance will cover the visit. Sometimes you may need a referral from your doctor at home or authorization from the insurance company before your visit. You can enroll in MIT SHIP if you experience a \"qualifying event. \" For example, if you turn 26 and become ineligible for your parent's plan, you can enroll in MIT SHIP immediately. You can also enroll in MIT SHIP if you lose your other health insurance coverage involuntarily \u2014 for example, if your parent loses their job and health insurance.Sometimes MIT Medical needs to send private information to you. This will be addressed to you and will go to the address you have on file with us. Unless you have given MIT Medical your campus mailing address, we will send this information to your home address. If you want to change your mailing address, call us at 617-253-4481. Can I access my health records from MIT Medical? Yes. We can provide a copy of your medical record if you need it. We can also provide copies of certain parts of your record \u2014 for example, just your immunization record if you need it for international travel. To get a copy of your whole medical record or just specific information from your record, you'll need to fill out and sign an authorization form. You can find this form and others at medical.mit.edu/medicalrecord . How will MIT Medical communicate with me? Through HealthELife: Your providers will communicate with you through our online patient portal, HealthELife. By text: Before an appointment, you may get texts on your phone. The texts will remind you about the appointment and allow you to cancel and reschedule the appointment if you need to. You can use your phone to complete registration information and health forms. That way, you do not need to fill out forms on paper when you arrive for your appointment. You might also get a text asking you to fill out a survey following a visit to MIT Medical's Mental Health & Counseling Services. By email: After an appointment, you might get an email asking you to fill out a survey. The survey is anonymous. It will ask questions about your experience at your appointment. In addition, you will sometimes get a patient newsletter by email. DID YOU KNOW? If you have questions or concerns about your care at MIT Medical, you can contact MIT Medical's patient relations coordinator. Just send an email to patientrelations@med.mit.edu. The patient relations coordinator will help you explore possible ways to resolve the issue.9 Getting your care off campus with MIT SHIP When you go to an off-campus, in-network provider, your insurance will pay for all or most of the cost. If you go to a doctor or hospital that is not in the BCBSMA PPO network, your insurance will pay less of the cost, and you will pay more \u2014 sometimes a lot more. For example, you will not have to pay any of the cost for your annual physical exam and lab tests if you go to an off-campus, in-network provider. But if you get your annual physical exam and lab tests from an out-of-network provider, you may have to pay between $100 and $500, depending on how much you have already spent for other healthcare services that year. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts (BCBSMA) can help you find an in-network provider: You can call BCBSMA at 1-800-810-BLUE (2583), or You can go to the Blue Cross Blue Shield website (https://www.bluecrossma.org/) and use the \"Find a doctor\" option. From the \"Select a Network\" drop-down menu, choose \"PPO or EPO. \" Your medical benefits (Summary of Benefits and Coverage) The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires all insurance plans to provide you with a Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) document. This document lists many, but not all, of the benefits that come with your health insurance plan and can help you understand when you will have out-of-pocket costs and how much you might have to pay. On the following pages, we will show you some information from the SBC for MIT SHIP , along with some definitions. You can view the SBC for MIT SHIP by visiting medical.mit.edu/forms-documents/students . MIT SHIP covers the off-campus healthcare services you need but you may still have some out-of-pocket costs. When we say that insurance \"covers\" a particular healthcare service, that means it will pay for at least part of the cost. MIT SHIP may cover some healthcare services \"in full. \" That means that once you have purchased MIT SHIP , you will pay nothing extra for that service. But you will have to pay part of the cost for other healthcare services. For example, if you get sick or injured and go to a hospital emergency room, you will pay $100, and MIT SHIP will pay for the rest. One hundred dollars may seem like a lot of money, but without insurance, an emergency room visit could cost $3,000 or more. Health insurance only covers the healthcare services you need. MIT SHIP pays for the usual tests you have every year as part of your annual physical exam, but if you are healthy and don't have symptoms of any illness or medical condition, MIT SHIP will not pay for extra tests or screening procedures. MIT SHIP will pay for diagnostic testing if you have symptoms of a specific illness or medical condition or if your healthcare provider agrees that you may be at risk for a certain condition and recommends those tests. MIT SHIP is a \"preferred provider organization, \" often called a \"PPO\" for short. A PPO is an insurance plan that lets you choose from a network of doctors and hospitals that have agreed to work with the insurance company. For MIT SHIP , this network is the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts (BCBSMA) PPO. With MIT SHIP , you can get your healthcare: At MIT Medical \u2014 You pay nothing extra for most services. At an off-campus, in-network provider \u2014 You will pay some of the cost for most services. At an off-campus, out-of-network provider \u2014 You will pay more of the cost for all services.About the MIT Student Health Insurance Plan (MIT SHIP)10 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts is an Independent Licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association Page 1 of 8 Summary of Benefits and Coverage: What this Plan Covers & What You Pay for Covered Services Coverage Period: on or after 0 9/01/2022 Blue Care Elect MIT Student Health Insurance Plan (MIT SHIP): MIT SHIP Students Coverage for: Individual and Family | Plan Type : PPO The Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) document will help you choose a health plan.

Important Questions Answers Why This Matters: What is the overall deductible ? $100 member / $100 family in-network ; $500 member out-of-network . Generally, you must pay all of the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this plan begins to pay. Are there services covered before you meet your deductible ? Yes. In-network preven tive and prenatal care, most office visits, prescription drugs , diagnostic tests and imaging, inpatient admissions, mental health services, home health care, hospice services , durable medical equipment ; emergency room, emergency transportation. This plan covers some items and services even if you haven't yet met the deductible amount. But a copayment or coinsurance may apply. For example, this plan covers certain preventive services without cost sharing and before you meet your deductible. See a list of c overed preventive services at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive- care-benefits/ . Are there other deductibles for specific services? Yes. For pediatric essential dental, $50 member (no more than $150 for three or more eligible members per family). There are no other specific deductibles . You must pay all of the costs for these services up to the specific deductible amount before this plan begins to pay for these services. What is the out -of-pocket limit for this plan? For medical benefits, $4,000 member / $8,000 family in -network ; $4,000 member / $8,000 family out-of-network ; for prescription drug benefits, $ 2,000 member / $4,000 family ; and for pediatric essential dental, $350 member (no more than $700 for two or more eligible members per family). The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered services. If you have other family members in this plan, they h ave to meet their own out-of-pocket limits until the overall family out -of- pocket limit has been met. Out-of-pocket limit The out-of-pocket limit is the maximum amount of money you will have to pay for your covered healthcare services during each year that you are covered (for MIT SHIP , from September 1-August 31). This does not include the plan's premium (the money you pay to buy the insurance plan in the first place). When you have spent enough of your own money to reach the out-of-pocket limit for the year, any other healthcare services you receive for that year will be covered in full. \"Covered in full\" means that the insurance company will pay the entire cost of those services. But if you use out-of-network services after reaching your out-of-pocket maximum, you may still need to pay the difference between the amount of money the insurance company agreed to pay for a service and the actual charge. MIT SHIP has two different out-of-pocket limits: 1. For medical services: $4,000 per individual per calendar year. 2. For prescriptions: $2,000 per individual per calendar year.Deductible A deductible is the total amount of your own money that you must pay for certain covered services during each year that you are covered (for MIT SHIP , from September 1-August 31). After you have paid that deductible, your insurance will begin paying for these services. MIT SHIP has two different deductibles: 1. For in-network services: $100 per individual per calendar year for outpatient services received outside of MIT Medical (except for mental health care, which has no deductible). 2. For out-of-network services: $500 per individual per calendar year for all services except emergency care.11 Page 2 of 8 Important Questions Answers Why This Matters: What is not included in the out-of-pocket limit ?

You will pay the most if you use an out-of-network provider, and you might receive a bill from a provider for the difference between the provider 's charge and what your plan pays ( balance billing).

Do you need a referral to see a specialist ? No. You can see the specialist you choose without a referral . All copayment and coinsurance costs shown in this chart are after your deductible has been met, if a deductible applies .

In-network provider An in-network provider for MIT SHIP is any healthcare provider (physician, hospital, urgent care, or other facility) that belongs to your Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) of Massachusetts PPO (preferred provider organization) network. The network for MIT SHIP is called the \"Blue Cross PPO/EPO\" network. You will almost always pay less if you use an in- network provider. You can find in-network providers for MIT SHIP on the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusett website on the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts website at bluecrossma.com or by calling 1-800-810-BLUE (2583) .Out-of-network provider An out-of-network provider is any healthcare provider that does not belong to your insurance company's preferred provider network (the \"Blue Cross PPO/EPO\" network for MIT SHIP). You can use out-of-network providers, but if you do, you will almost always have to pay more. If an out-of- network provider charges more for a service than your insurance company agrees to pay, you will need to pay the difference, and that payment will not count toward your out-of-pocket limit. Primary care visit Primary care is what most people think of when they talk about \"going to the doctor. \" Primary care includes routine check-ups or seeing a doctor when you feel sick. You'd also visit a primary care provider if you need regular, ongoing care for a chronic condition like asthma or diabetes or if you need lab tests or vaccines.Preventive services The Affordable Care Act, a US law that went into effect in 2010, requires healthcare providers and facilities to offer preventive services at no cost to patients. Preventive services are meant to prevent illness or disease and include services like check-ups, some lab tests, vaccinations, and some special healthcare services for women, like certain kinds of birth control and pregnancy care.Specialist visit Specialists are clinicians who treat specific medical conditions. For example, a dermatologist is a specialist who treats skin problems. An orthopedist is a specialist who treats patients with bone injuries or diseases. If you see a specialist at MIT Medical, you will not have a copay or other out-of-pocket cost. If you visit a specialist outside of MIT Medical, you will probably have to pay part of the cost of the visit. Your insurance may only cover a certain number of visits each year for some kinds of specialists, like chiropractors.12 Page 3 of 8 Common Medical Event Services You May Need What You Will Pay Limitations, Exceptions, & Other Important Information In-Network (You will pay the least) Out-of-Network (You will pay the most) If you have a test Diagnostic test (x-ray, blood work) No charge 20% coinsurance Deductible applies first for out-of- network ; pre-authorization be required Imaging (CT/PET scans, MRIs) $50 20% coinsurance Deductible applies first for out-of- network ; copayment applies per category of test / day; pre- authorization may be required If you need drugs to treat your illness or condition More information about prescription drug coverage is available at bluecrossma.org/medicatio n Generic drugs $20 / retail supply or $40 / designated retail or mail order supply Not covered Up to 30- day retail (90- day designated retail or mail order) supply; cost share may be waived for certain covered drugs and supplies; pre-authorization required for certain drugs Preferred brand drugs $30 / retail supply or $60 / designated retail or mail order supply Not covered Non-preferred brand drugs $40 / retail supply or $80 / designated retail or mail order supply Not covered Specialty drugs Applicable cost share (generic, preferred, non-preferred) Not covered When obtained from a designated specialty pharmacy; pre-authorization required for certain drugs If you have outpatient surgery Facility fee (e.g., ambulatory surgery center) No charge; 10% coinsurance for infertility technologies 20% coinsurance Deductible applies first ; pre- authorization required for certain services Physician/surgeon fees No charge; 10% coinsurance for infertility technologies 20% coinsurance Deductible applies first ; pre- authorization required for certain services Copay or Copayment A copay or copayment is a fixed dollar amount you must pay for a covered healthcare service. If a service has a copay, you will usually pay it when you go to that appointment. Copayments do not count toward your annual deductible.Coinsurance Coinsurance is a percentage of the bill for a specific service that you must pay with your own money. The insurance company decides how much they will pay for any particular service, and your coinsurance percentage is based on this price. If you go to an out- of-network provider who charges more than the price your insurance company has agreed to pay for that service, you may have to pay the coinsurance amount PLUS the price difference. Drugs Different types of prescription drugs cost different amounts. When a generic drug is available, it will usually be the least expensive. Generic drugs are drugs that are created to be the same as a brand-name drug. They work the same way and are an equal substitute for a more expensive brand-name drug. 13 Page 3 of 8 Common Medical Event Services You May Need What You Will Pay Limitations, Exceptions, & Other Important Information In-Network (You will pay the least) Out-of-Network (You will pay the most) If you have a test Diagnostic test (x-ray, blood work) No charge 20% coinsurance Deductible applies first for out-of- network ;
