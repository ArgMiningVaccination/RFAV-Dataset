We all want to live long and happy lives to be able to enjoy work, hobbies, family, and friends. Healthy aging and longevity start with a healthy body. Unfortunately, we live in a toxic world and all those toxins enter our bodies through breathing, eating, and touching. We don't know what toxins we have unless we do proper laboratory tests and analyses. The autonomic nervous system plays a major role in the regulation of bodily functions such as digestion, heart rate, and respiratory rate among others. Thus, proper functioning of the autonomic nervous system is very important for homeostasis and overall health. Here at Natural Medicine & Detox, we feel it is important to have a baseline of where you are when you come in so we can measure the progress you are making. These baselines help us create a unique treatment plan for each individual's needs. The goal is to get the best and fastest results. To properly and effectively diagnose your specific medical condition, we require certain lab tests or questionnaires... Call us for an appointment today: (602)307-0888 Fax (602)307-1002 Heavy Metal Test Heavy metals have a direct impact on disease, specifically the carcinogenic potential inducing cancer in humans. A heavy metal test checks for irregular levels of toxic or potentially harmful metals that have accumulated in the tissues of the body. We live in a toxic world and toxic metals can be found in the air, food, and water we consume. We do encourage urine testing. It involves the administration of a chelating (heavy metal-binding) agent intravenously. After the IV, you go home and collect your urine for the next 6 hours. We give you everything you need to send it off to the lab. Toxic Metals tested for at Natural Medicine and Detox includes... - Aluminum - Antimony - Arsenic - Barium - Beryllium - Bismuth - Cadmium - Cesium - Gadolinium - Lead - Mercury - Nickel - Palladium - Platinum - Tellurium - Thallium - Thorium - Tin - Tungsten - Uranium Exposure to heavy metals including arsenic, lead, cadmium, and copper is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease. Calcification of the coronary arteries also plays a key role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Coronary artery calcification correlates highly with plaque burden, it is an excellent disease marker for atherosclerosis. Calcification is present in 55% of men and women under 40 years; all hearts show some calcification by age 50 in men, and by age 60 in women. A calcium score of zero is associated with a very low prevalence of any coronary atherosclerotic plaque. [Chelation](https://naturalmedicineanddetox.com/services-at-natural-medicine-detox/services-iv-therapies/services-chelation-iv-therapy/) can safely reduce calcification levels in your blood vessels. More information: HRV Evaluate Your Stress Levels with HRV testing... At Natural Medicine and Detox, we perform HRV Scan testing to evaluate your Heart Rate Variability, Pulse, and Physical and Emotional Health. Data Pulse Analysis & Heart rate variability (HRV) are measurable reflections of the balance between the two branches of the autonomic nervous system: the sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. Sympathetic is your \"fight-or-flight\" response. It manages increases in heart rate and blood pressure in emergency situations. Parasympathetic is what helps balance out the sympathetic nervous system and slows down the heart rate and lowers blood pressure, especially after a fight-or-flight situation. Heart rate variability (HRV) testing has also been extensively used as a marker for cardiac status and general health. Heart rate variability (HRV) is where the amount of time between your heartbeats fluctuates slightly. It takes special devices to register and analyze the heartbeat; but the results can indicate current or future health problems, including heart conditions and mental health issues like anxiety and depression. What is your biological age? Find out what your actual age is compared to your biological age. We all want to be younger than our actual age. This is a clear indication of anti-aging. Are you experiencing adrenal fatigue? You may want to test your autonomic regulation properties. See how the relationships of your sympathetic, parasympathetic, and Neurohormonal nervous systems work together and what you can do to avoid the disastrous effects of adrenal fatigue. Find out your stress levels, and test your Stress Index to find out how hard your nervous system has to work to achieve balance. How well does your body regulate energy & metabolism? The normal range is between 50-100 and this represents how well chemical messengers or hormones can communicate at the right time. These chemical messengers are responsible for your energy production and metabolism. You can boost these hormones through deep restful sleep, exercise, and BrainTap. More information...
