Our booking system will open in a new window About Lisa Lewis Lisa's background is working on the trading floor in a very highly stressful environment. Eventually after 10 years this led to office-based work, once the financial markets closed their live trading pits and turned to online screen trading. This environment led Lisa to gain an interest in how stress of any kind be it, work, long hours, mental fatigue, poor posture and emotional stress can affect the body. This can then lead to many dysfunctions within the body and can lead to many disruptions within our equilibrium. Lisa qualified in, Anatomy, Physiology and Body Massage in 1998, followed by Aromatherapy and Sports Massage in 2001. Reflexology and Indian Head Massage followed in 2002 and finally Lisa studied for a degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine and Cupping qualifying in 2007 with a BSc. Complementary Therapy is not just for stress, sports injuries or poor posture. Regular treatments are preventative and can allow your body, mind and spirit to be much calmer enabling us to cope with our daily lives and needs in a more balanced way.
