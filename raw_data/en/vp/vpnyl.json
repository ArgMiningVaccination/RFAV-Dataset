It is anticipated that 42,000 veteri-narians will be needed to meet the demands from retirement and industry growth in the U.S. small animal sector by 2030. This total doesn't even factor in the 25% of practitio-ners reportedly contemplating leaving the profession soon if nothing changes. Just how is that shortfall going to be covered? Equine practice is no different and, unfortunately, perhaps worse off. Our shortage is not just projected, it is already here. It is estimated that by 2030 equine practice will require 5,300 veterinarians to meet growth and retirement demands (there are currently 3,645 practicing equine vets). Now remember that only 1.3% of all U.S. veterinary graduates enter equine practice directly, 4.5% enter internships and, during the first five years, 50% of them leave the profession. Currently, 30% of AAEP members are age 59 or older. The reality is that equine practice is a fraction of small animal practice but with a much larger problem. It was against that backdrop that my presidential year began at the 2021 convention. At that board of directors meeting, the Retention Task Force shared data from months of interviews with practice owners, students, new graduates and early associates. The pain points they identified were clear, and our colleagues were suffering. Practice owners were struggling to hire and retain employees, while younger colleagues were having trouble finding a space where they felt like they belonged and could thrive. Turning data into action At our January board meeting, we formed an operational plan. The AAEP would focus on sustainability in equine practice as our No. 1 strategic priority and, over the next few years, change would be realized, collectively envisioned and developed by the members themselves. The ambitious plan included the following broad strokes: By convention in 2022, we wanted to leave no doubt that this issue had reached a critical level of importance and needed immediate action; gather colleagues together to target key areas and strategize possible solutions; and \"come clean\" by sharing the findings of the task force beyond veterinarians (i.e., with other organizations, horse owners and industry partners). #Z DPOWFOUJPO JO 2023 XF XBOUFE UP IBWF NFNCFST working on identified areas by developing solutions and programs to address core issues affecting sustainability. #Z DPOWFOUJPO JO 2024 XF XBOUFE UP DIBNQJPO solutions that make a difference and show positive impact; encourage others to take action so we can scale up across the organization (and profession); change the tone of equine practice; and most of all CHANGE THE NUMBERS (e.g., see more students entering equine practice, see a rise in students identi-fying their internship program as a positive educa-tional experience, and see a decrease in the number of new graduates leaving in the first five years). We also envisioned that changes which need to be made will have a positive effect on practice culture and life balance for all of us. By the end of the January meeting, we had convened two different task forces. The first, an internship task force, was asked to reimagine a true educational experience for new graduates and not one that simply capitalized on \"cheap labor.\" The second task force focused on organizing a practitioner summit meeting, which was held in May in Dallas, Texas, with 20 practice owners from across the U.S. representing various backgrounds and sectors. Focusing on five key areas The themes identified at that summit meeting led to the formation of the Commission on Sustainability in Equine Practice, approved by the board in July. In August, the Member Engagement Committee and the officers estab-lished five subcommittees focused on compensation, emergency coverage, practice culture, internships, and veterinary students. The compensation subcommittee's first task was to establish a reliable number for salary and benefits and a demonstrated pathway that new graduates could trust. A survey completed by more than 1,300 colleagues captured accurate information specific to equine practice in all sectors. The internship task force became the internship subcom- mittee as they continued their work to transform the Avenues program into AAEP Grow. Their vision is to establish guidelines for best practices, a set of educational outcomes for all internships to offer, additional tools to help practices work with young colleagues, and a system to give interns finishing their program the opportunity to provide feedback to encourage other young vets to enter this intense period of preparation. The veterinary student subcommittee was asked to scrutinize the relationship between AAEP members and students. What messaging do students receive and how AAEP News December 2022 III ASSOCIA TION ASSOCIA TION From the president: Making the work fit the workforce By Emma Read, DVM, MVSc, DACVS Dr. Emma Read continued on next page 5:33 PMIV AAEP News December 2022ASSOCIA TION ASSOCIA TION can members play a more active role in sharing all the great things equine has to offer? How can practitioners provide skills opportunities and support for the next generation? The emergency coverage subcommittee was tasked with identifying and culti-vating alternative models to manage emergency work and sharing these more broadly with members. Meanwhile, the practice culture subcommittee was tasked with defining what makes up the \"culture\" of equine practice and how best to empower practice owners to prioritize health and welfare of all staff without compromising client care or the economics of the practice. How can we do what we do, but do it smarter and in a way that looks after everybody? In addition to the Commission, the board has established funding to assist young colleagues wanting to participate in mentorship programs like Decade One or MentorVet. The board has also created a Horse Owner Education Committee, and I wrote a couple articles targeting horse owners and the industry at large. Contributing in your own way We are already one year into our efforts and one year closer to the 2030 projections, which feels unsettling except for the fact we are starting to make change. I have been extremely honored to serve as your president and to play a small part in getting this very large rock rolling down the hill. Now as we are picking up momentum, we will need all of you. This problem is not going to be fixed by AAEP leaders creating the solutions and pushing them from the \"top down.\" The solutions to our problems lay within each of us and within our practices, and it is reaching for ways to do things differently that will help even in the smallest of ways. It will be the innovation and dedication of each person in wanting to change the numbers and build beyond what we already have. Just as equine seemingly led the way into the abyss, I am positive that we will be the ones to effectively lead the way out. We can do this but we will have to work together\u2014a tough order for a bunch of hard working, fiercely independent, and really busy people! I leave you with this thought that I heard while attending the British Equine Veterinary Association Congress in September as your representative. During a discussion among roughly 30 presidents and executive directors from many of the global equine associations, every single one noted that sustainability is their top strategic priority. BEVA President Dr. Huw Griffiths summed it up well when he said that this was all about \"making the work fit the workforce, rather than making the workforce fit the work.\" If every member starts there, we can transform the numbers and change the headlines associated with our profession. Thank you for the opportunity of a lifetime. From the president, continued This problem is not going to be fixed by AAEP leaders creating the solutions and pushing them from the \"top down.\" The solutions to our problems lay within each of us and within our practices, and it is reaching for ways to do things differ - ently that will help even in the smallest of ways.

EVE_December22_Text_Print.pdf 5 22/11/22 5:33 PMVI AAEP News December 2022 Ethical equine practice begins with a strong foundation and training By Ernie Martinez II, DVM, MBA Practicing high-quality equine medicine can be a challenging career path. After completing veterinary school and successfully passing boards, young vet-erinarians are eager to get out into the world and practice medicine, diagnose cases, devise treatment plans, and consult with mentors and specialists. Added unwanted challenges can arise when veterinari- ans are placed in complex scenarios that may confront their ethics. To prepare new graduates and young doctors on how to handle ethically challenging situations, an equine veterinary ethics program introduced from day one can provide the training and tools to set the foundation for a career in ethical equine practice. An equine veterinary ethics program should include defined written standards, training programs, reporting mechanisms and violations policy, and a strategy for periodic assessment. Defined written standards will clarify and educate all employees\u2014practitioners and support staff\u2014on the ethics and values of the practice as well as employee expectations. The ethics of a practice are the principles, norms and standards that govern a group. Practice ethics can be found in mission and value statements commonly presented in employee handbooks. Often these go hand-in-hand with the morals, principles and rules we follow as individuals. Practice ethics are defined by practice leadership and have a huge impact on determining the culture of an organization. Once defined, written standards of ethical conduct should be shared during the onboarding and orientation of new veterinarians and staff. Successful ethical practices should utilize an ethics training program to further educate and train the individ-uals in a practice most likely to face complex ethical challenges. An internal assessment can help identify ethical dilemmas and those most likely to be challenged. In most cases, this is likely to be a doctor asked to provide unethical treatments or procedures, but a staff member may also be challenged ethically with regard to records, invoices, client communications or by assisting in unethical treatments or procedures. The training program and educational materials should be shared with doctors and staff on a regular basis, such as annual reviews or performance evaluations. By providing tools such as an ethical decision-making model, ethics and ethical practice will remain on the minds of all team members. A key component of an ethics training program is high- lighting and clearly defining the proper reporting mechanisms doctors and staff should take when faced with ethical issues or challenges. Young veterinarians may rely on a mentor or senior clinician, but in certain cir - cumstances, a non-veterinarian resource may be better. This may include a practice manager or medical director, but the most appropriate resource is a human resources specialist trained to address these issues. If the practice size or model does not include an HR specialist, there are resources available through the AAEP and the AVMA that can provide the proper channel for a young practi-tioner to seek help with an ethical challenge. These resources may serve as an ombudsman and facilitate a fair resolution acting in the capacity of a neutral third party. When ethical violations are identified, a violation policy ensures that punish-ments are handed down fairly. Punishments may include internal fines, loss of titles, decreased leadership roles and possible repercussions from veterinary licensing bodies. A strategic schedule for an annual review of the ethical compliance of an organiza-tion should be created to assess the performance and success of an ethical training program. Ethical challenges will arise in equine medicine. Successful leadership presents a forceful tone from the top to define the ethical standards of the practice. Those who incorporate an equine veterinary ethics program into the culture of their practice will best prepare their doctors and staff for ethical challenges. An ethics program with defined values, guidelines, penalties and open discussions about veterinary ethics will enhance the reputation and goodwill of the practice and, ultimately, make it a more successful and welcoming place to practice.

EVE_December22_Text_Print.pdf 6 22/11/22 5:33 PMAAEP News December 2022 VII Vet Direct Safety Net provides the gift of a peaceful passing The Foundation-AAEP-ASPCA partnership can support a humane end to a dire situation Dr. Shannon Subasi, owner of Los Alamos Equine Veterinary Services in northern New Mexico, enjoys seeing horses throughout their various life stages. At least one reunion with a former patient, however, was anything but a joyous occasion. Dakota had been a valued companion at a local therapeu-tic riding program while under Dr. Subasi's care before joining the Luffel family to teach their children the ropes of riding. Although they were not regular clients, the Luffels contacted Dr. Subasi months later\u2014in December 2021\u2014requesting emergency care for Dakota. The gelding had fallen and remained down when Dr. Subasi arrived. The family was deeply distressed and hopeful for a positive outcome. \"We tried to diagnose what was wrong with him and, understandably, the owners wanted a clear diagnosis, which is sometimes hard,\" said Dr. Subasi. \"We tried taking radiographs of his distal femur and stifle to see if there might be a fracture there.\" Dr. Subasi doesn't have an ultrasound\u2014she refers more- intense cases that may need treatments and modalities that are difficult to complete in the field. Sending Dakota to the clinic, however, was not an option financially for the Luffels. \"With a 1,000-pound horse, there are limitations to [what] radiographs [can show] in the field. The owners wanted to give him a chance and he was willing to try to stand, so we stood him up,\" Dr. Subasi explained. \"I tried to palpate him rectally and could not find an obvious step. I said it was possible that he slipped and had nerve damage that was resulting in the way he was holding his leg and unable to bear weight, but that a fracture was likely.\" To make Dakota more comfortable while locating a field ultrasound, Dr. Subasi administered nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories for a few days. The reprieve\u2014for both Dakota and his owners\u2014was desperately needed as the Luffels had rushed their 3-year-old child to the emergency room with a brain mass the same day Dakota went down. Searching for a way to financially assist the family, Dr. Subasi came across the Vet Direct Safety Net program while reading Equine Veterinary Education. She immedi-ately emailed the AAEP for more information on the program. After a 15-minute onboarding and minimal paperwork, she knew she could alleviate at least some of the family's financial concerns.\"Unfortunately, Dakota deteriorated after a few days and went down again,\" said Dr. Subasi. \"At this point, he was unwilling to rise and the owners agreed to euthanize him.\" Though a heartbreaking decision to make, the availability of Vet Direct Safety Net funds allowed the Luffels the financial flexibility to see if Dakota could heal before making the decision to euthanize him. Designed to reduce the number of horses relinquished to rescues or sent to auction, the program reimburses up to $600 worth of free veterinary services per horse to assist owners with horses in need of emergency stabilization procedures, euthanasia or disposal. \"I would absolutely recommend this program to other vets,\" she said. \"I do feel the program helped the Luffels enormously. We all are in this because we want to help horses\u2014money should not be the reason that horses don't get the care they need. Life happens sometimes and the money isn't there when you need it, especially in times of emergency.\" Though unable to save Dakota, the Luffels appreciated the availability of Vet Direct Safety Net funds to offer their beloved gelding a chance and, eventually, relieve him of his suffering. They even hired Dr. Subasi as veterinarian for their pony.

Over the last four years, The Foundation has provided $436,675 to support meaningful equine research by up-and-coming investigators as it continues to help pioneer medical advances in equine health. For the third consecutive year, The Foundation was joined by the Thoroughbred Education and Research Foundation in helping make these research projects possible. This year TERF, whose mission is to make racing safer through research and education, increased its support by funding three important research projects with the potential to impact the health and safety of Thoroughbred athletes. The supported research projects with researcher names and brief summaries follow: Dual licensing of mesenchymal stem cells to enhance tendon healing (TERF sponsored) Dr. Drew W. Koch, North Carolina State University Utilize in vitro co-culture assays to determine if IL-1b and/or TGF-b2 licensed mesenchymal (MSC) positively affect equine superficial digital flexor tendon tenocyte growth, function, and expression of tendon-relevant genes and proteins to support future in vivo studies examining licensed MSC therapy for equine tendon injury. In vitro analysis of the optimization of stem cell therapy for the treatment of osteoarthritis using equine synovial fluid derived from mesenchymal stem cells with a soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor (TERF sponsored) Dr. Alexandra Carlson, University of Tennessee To determine if using soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (sEHi) with stem cell therapy can improve stem cell activity by reducing inflammation in the joint while also eliminating adverse effects on the stem cells that typical anti-inflammatory treatment can have. Clinical evaluation of a rapid test strip, PCR, and enriched-aerobic culture for the detection of salmonella enterica in equine feces Dr. Emily Herring, University of GeorgiaEvaluate the rapid test's performance, compared to culture and PCR, for the detection of salmonella in equine fecal samples by performing all three tests in parallel on the same samples to assess their ability to determine whether a horse is infected with salmonella correctly.Short-term oil dietary supplemen- tation affects oocyte and cumulus cell metabolism in old mares Dr. Giovana Di Donato Catandi, Colorado State UniversityInvestigate how oils rich in omega-6 or omega-3 fatty acids affect the metabolic function of the oocyte and ovarian follicle cells and determine if additional dietary supplements can optimize fatty acid use in the ovarian follicle while reducing potential side effects. A pilot study on an experimental model for Palmar Osteochondral Disease (POD) in horses (TERF sponsored) Dr. Lauren Smanik, Colorado State University To develop an experimental model of Palmar Osteochondral Disease (POD) that would allow research-ers to study the progression in a controlled, prospective manner that will allow for future studies on variables that may affect lesion severity and facilitate the development of an optimized treatment plan. Investigation of MARCKS protein as a novel therapeutic target to decreased neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in equine asthma Dr. Bethanie L. Cooper, North Carolina State UniversityTo identify novel treatment alternatives to steroid therapy for horses with equine asthma through neutrophil extracellular traps, released by airway neutrophils, as potential therapeutic targets.

This retrospective study by Fleur Whitlock and co- workers in the UK and South Africa described the epidemiology of this epidemic within Great Britain . Epidemiological data were obtained from veterinary surgeons referring samples for EI virus testing. Where available, data on con rmed cases and their wider resident population on EI-infected premises were collated anddescribed. On a national level, spatial and temporal representations, consisting of choropleth maps and epidemic curves, described the spread of EI. EI-infected premises-level factors associated with the rst of two epidemic phases were investigated using ordinary logistic regression analysis. There were 412 con rmed cases and 234 EI-infected premises, with the rst of two epidemic phases occurring between January and April, followed by a second phasethrough to August. The median age of con rmed cases was 5 years, and sports horses (24%) and Cobs (16%) made upthe highest proportions by general horse type and breed. Among con rmed cases, 72% were unvaccinated and 18% were vaccinated against EI. New horses arriving within2 weeks of a con rmed case were reported by 42% of EI- infected premises. Investigation of EI-infected premises'biosecurity measures indicated that 23% quarantined new arrivals, 37% had isolation facilities and 57% of resident horses were vaccinated. EI-infected premises were more likely in the rst than second epidemic phase to be classi ed as professional, have a vaccinated con rmed case and EI con rmed in a newly arrived animal. EI-infected premises generally had low levels of population vaccine coverageand implemented limited preventive biosecurity measures, particularly linked to horse movements. Gut health in horses The conventional feeding management of horses is still characterised by high-starch and low- bre diets, which can negatively affect gastrointestinal health. The aim of this studyby Elena Colombino and co-workers in Italy and Germany was to compare the effects of a high-starch (HS) vs. a high- bre (HF) diet on gut health in horses . A total of 19 Bardigiano horses destined for slaughter (aged 14.3 /C60.7 months) were randomly allotted to two dietary groups: HS (5 llies and 4 colts) and HF group (7 llies and 3 colts). They received the same rst-cut meadow hay but different complementary feeds for 72 days: HS group wasfed 8 kg/animal/day of a starch-rich complementary feed while HF group was fed 3.5 kg/animal/day of a bre-rich complementary feed. At slaughter, stomachs were separatedand washed for the evaluation of the glandular and squamous regions. Also, duodenum, rectum and liver were excised and submitted tohistomorphometrical evaluation. The glandular region of the HS group presented more severe gastric mucosa lesions compared with the HF group. A statistical tendency was also found for the squamous region,presenting a higher score in the HS than HF diet. Regarding morphometry, in jejunum villus height to crypt depth (Cd) ratio was in fluenced by sex, being greater in males than in females while in ileum Cd depended on interaction betweensex and diet, being greater in the HS group males. In addition, in the duodenum and right dorsal colon, the severity of the in flammation depended on sex, being greater in females than in males. In contrast, in the jejunum and inthe pelvic flexure, in flammation was in fluenced by diet, being more severe in the HS than in the HF group. These results suggested that HS diet provoked more severe mucosa lesions in the glandular region of the stomachand a higher in flammation both in the jejunum and pelvic flexure. The authors concluded that this study could represent a starting point for further investigations on gut health in horses. Subpalpebral lavage treatment systems This retrospective study by Emilie Qu /C19er/C19e and Sabine Chahory, based in France, described the outcomes and complicationsassociated with the location of subpalpebral lavage (SPL) treatment systems, in the superior or inferior eyelid in horses . Clinical records of all horses admitted to the National Veterinary School of Alfort over an 18-year period, in which a SPL treatment system was used to administer topical ophthalmic medications, were reviewed. Sixty horses were included in the study representing 61 SPL treatment systems. Uneventful outcomes occurred in 53 cases (86.9%), and complications were recorded in 8 cases (13.1%). Seven complications were reported for upper eyelid systems (23.3%) and one complication for lower eyelid systems (4.2%). The complication rates were not signi cantly different between these two locations. The complications identi were iatrogenic corneal Median duration of SPL treatment system use was 7.5 days. The easier placement and removal and the lower incidence of complications identi ed in this study has encouraged the authors to favour the lower fornix for subpalpebral lavage treatment systemswithin their equine hospital. Vitamin D status in horses The aim of this cross-sectional cohort study by Miranda Dosi and co-workers in the UK was to determine the relationship between management, season and endocrine disease and vitamin D status in horses . Plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 2(25[OH] D2) and D 3(25[OH]D 3) were measured by liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry in 34 healthy unsupplemented grazing ponies, and 22 stabled Thoroughbreds receiving supplementary vitamin D 3in feed. A nested group of 18 grazing ponies were sampled on longand short days ( >12 and <12 h of light/day) to determine the effect of sunlight exposure. Additionally, the relationshipsbetween age, sex, adiposity, serum insulin, adrenocorticotropic hormone and vitamin status in a mixed group of 107 horses using a linear regression model. All animals had measurable levels of 25(OH)D 2(median 10.7 nmol/L) while 25(OH)D 3was only detected in Thoroughbreds receiving D 3supplementation. Thoroughbreds had lower concentrations of 25(OH)D 2than ponies (7.4 L 25(OH)D 2concentrations were signi cantly higher on long days compared with short days (14.4 nmol/L vs. 8.7 nmol/L), while 25(OH)D 3was undetectable. Measures of increased adiposity, but not basal insulin, were associated with higher 25(OH)D 2concentrations, conversely to humans. Increasing ACTH was associated withlower 25(OH)D 2. In horses, 25(OH)D 2is the predominant vitamin D metabolite, and there is an apparent lack of endogenous vitamin D 3production. The relationship between vitamin D and endocrine disorders in horses does not re flect that of other species. Venous lactate after colic surgery This prospective clinical study by Lauren Smanik and co- workers in the United States evaluated venous lactate measurements in horses following colic surgery and aimed to determine whether lactate concentrations were signi cantly higher in horses that developed postoperative complicationsor did not survive to hospital discharge . Horses >1 year of age undergoing surgery for colic and recovered from general anaesthesia were sampled. A portable lactate meter was used to measure venous samples collected immediately following anaesthetic recovery and daily throughout hospitalisation. Complications arising during hospitalisation and survival to hospital discharge were recorded. Fifty-one horses were enrolled, aged from 2 to 29 years. Lactate concentration immediately following anaesthetic recovery was higher in horses that developed complications during hospitalisation. The odds of developing complications postoperatively were doubled for horses with a venous lactate mmol/L. Lactate measurements in non-survivors were cantly higher with survivors by 96 h postoperatively. Higher venous lactate concentrations in the postoperative colic period were associated with an increased risk of complications and death. Results suggest horses with higher venous lactate measurements in recovery are more likely tohave postoperative complications, with the odds of developing complications doubled for horses with a venous lactate >5 mmol/L. Evaluation of venous lactate could provide information on prognosis in the postoperative periodfor horses with surgical colic. CT of the intervertebral foramina The aims of this retrospective, analytical study by Tibor Roveland co-workers in Belgium were to describe a quantifying computed tomographic (CT) cervicothoracicintervertebral of IF size measures; test associations between IF size and adjacent articular process (AP) size, ventral extent, and anatomic location; and determine the proportion of IF with narrowing. Computed tomographic images were acquired in 20 Warmblood horses that presented with forelimb lameness and/or neck pain. All IF between C5 and T2 ( n= 160) were evaluated. IF cross-sectional area (CSA), APCSA and APventral extent were measured. The repeatability of IFCSA measurement was calculated. Possible associations between IFCSA and APCSA, ventral extent, side or location were assessed. IF narrowing was de ned as more than 50% of reduction in IF height when compared to its widest part(s). The repeatability of IFCSA measurement was excellent. There was a signi cant association between IFCSA and APCSA, ventral extent and location (higher values betweenC7 and T2). The association between IFCSA and ventral extent was small. Narrowing was identi ed in 61 (38.1%) IF. Maximum degree of narrowing was most common at thecranial (26.3%) and middle (68.8%) third of the IF. Narrowing was not identi ed at T1-T2. The authors concluded that CT cervicothoracic IF size can be measured with excellentrepeatability, and associations were found between IF size and AP size, ventral extent and location. S.

Marcatili* , F. Cantatore , G. Riley and J. Withers Crown Inn Farm, Pool House Equine Clinic, A 9-year-old 390-kg games pony presented with acute onset of grade 5/5 (AAEP) right hindlimb (RH) lameness. During the clinical examination, the source of lameness was localised to the tarsal region. Radiographical examination identi ed a closed, simple, non-displaced, incomplete fracture of thecalcaneal shaft. The pony was initially treated with box rest and oral phenylbutazone (2.2 mg/kg bwt s.i.d.). Despite an initial good response, horse re-presented with a grade 5/5 (AAEP) RH lameness, 2 weeks after initial presentation. The decision was made to treat the fracture using a tarsal sleevecast extending from the mid-third of the tibia/crus to the level of distal metatarsus. The cast was replaced every 2 weeks and maintained for a total of 8 weeks. After cast removal, the horse was kept on strict box rest for 3 weeks. After discharge from the hospital, in-hand walking exercise from the stable was commenced and gradually increased over a 4-week period. The horse was then gradually reintroduced to a small paddock turnout exercise for eight further weeks. The horse was able to return to full athletic function. Conservativetreatment using a tarsal sleeve cast should be considered only in horses presenting with an incomplete non-displaced fracture of the calcaneal shaft ( Figs 1 and 2). Key points Incomplete non-displaced fractures of the calcaneal shaft that do not respond to stall rest can be treated with a tarsal sleeve cast. The use of a tarsal sleeve cast avoids the need forgeneral anaesthesia, improves the horse 's comfort and reduces the risk of complications associated with fulllimb casts. After successful treatment, horses can resume theirprevious level of activity. Fig 2: DLPMO radiographic projection of the right tarsus taken 12 weeks after discharge from the hospital.

Kelly\u00a7 The Philip Leverhulme Equine Hospital, University of Liverpool, Neston;Alan Ritchie Equine Veterinary Dentistry, Kingsley; and\u00a7The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, UK *Corresponding author email: pony mare, 60 days in foal, was presented for investigation of low-grade colic of 24-hours duration. On rectal examination, the left ovary was enlarged and painful. Rectal ultrasonography showed an abnormal, 7- cm-diameter, well-circumscribed, encapsulated structure with a reticular pattern within the left ovary ( Fig 1 ). A unilateral ovarian haematoma was suspected. Repeat ultrasound 72 h laterrevealed an increase in size (9 cm diameter). Transcutaneous ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen revealed swirling, mixed echogenicity fluid (6 -7 cm), compatible with haemoperitoneum (HP) and con rmed by mmol/L). Transrectal ultrasonographic examination 6 days after admission revealed the right ovary had developed a similar lesion. Conservative management was advised, and the mare was discharged 9 days after admission. Within 24 h, the mare represented with acute tachycardia (90 beats/min), pale mucous membranes and increased capillary re ll >3 Ultrasonographic examination revealed PCV (24%), severe hypoproteinaemia (TP 36 g/L) and elevated systemic lactate concentration (2.3 mmol/L), consistent with acute haemorrhage. Over the following 12 h, the tachycardia worsened (100 beats/min), and PCV decreased (11%) with hypoproteinaemia profound hypoxaemia developed (25.5 mmHg despite oxygen supplementation), and she developed an intermittent cough. Haemodynamicsupportive therapy was implemented, and the mare underwent a standing bilateral laparoscopic-assisted ovariectomy. Both ovaries were removed through an extended left-sided incision. The ovaries were enlarged (approximately 20 925 cm) with hyperaemic and irregular marginated surfaces with tearing of the serosa ( Fig 2 ). The mare received further haemodynamic supplementation (whole blood, plasma, colloids and hypertonicsaline) in the postoperative period. Minor self-limiting complications occurred (incisional oedema) and the HP resolved. Histopathology of the ovaries con rmed bilateral granulosa theca cell tumours. The surgical sites healed with nocomplication. At 335 days, the mare delivered a healthy lly foal. Parturition was unassisted and normal. Key points Granulosa cell tumours should be considered a rarebut possible case of haemoperitoneum in mares and ultrasonographic evaluation of the ovaries should be undertaken. Granulosa cell tumours (bilateral) can develop inpregnant mares. Bilateral ovariectomy in a pregnant mare after 70 daysof gestation can result in successful delivery of a live foal.

M. Beachler Veterinary Diagnostic and Production Animal Medicine, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, USA Corresponding author email: beachler@iastate.edu Keywords: horse; pregnancy; abortion; maternal disease; progestin Introduction Systemic disease occurring in the pregnant mare presents many unique challenges and complications to routine case management, including the limitations on surgical interventions and pharmaceutical choices, as well as the inherent need to support fetoplacental health to prevent pregnancy loss. The Case Report by Sinovich and colleagues in this issue exempli es some of these challenges (Sinovich et al., 2022). Cases of maternal medical disease affecting almost allbody systems can have profound effects on fetoplacental health, fetal viability and pregnancy maintenance due to the presence of severe stress, endotoxaemia or endogenous prostaglandin production (Giles et al., 1993; Perkins, 1999; Bucca, 2006). Therefore, treatment and expedited resolution of the primary disease process when possible is paramount. Due to the varied nature of diseases affecting the vast number of possible body systems, an investigation into individualised pregnancy support measures is impractical, and treatments used in cases of reproductive disease such as ascending placentitis are frequently applied as ancillary measures to support fetoplacental health and to promote pregnancy maintenance. Progestins Progestins are the clinical rst-line defence to assist the maintenance of pregnancy in cases of maternal medicaldisease. While progestins have been used to promote uterine quiescence in horses for the last 30 years, most of the evidence supporting their use in preventing pregnancy loss was documented in the early stages of pregnancy. Altrenogest, a synthetic oral progestin, was shown to prevent pregnancy loss in 100% of mares treated with the synthetic prostaglandin, cloprostenol, while all cloprostenol only treated control mares aborted (Daels et al., 1996). Additionally, in a model of experimental endotoxaemia, mares between 21 and 35 days of gestation, who were administered 44 mg of daily altrenogest in the face of systemic endotoxin to stimulate endogenous prostaglandin production and pregnancy loss, were able to remain pregnant until Day 70 of gestation (Daels et al., 1991a). Therefore, these studies, and the study by Bailey and co-workers (2010) demonstrating improved outcomes when altrenogest was used as multimodal therapy in experimental placentitis, have supported altrenogest use in any mare at risk for abortion or experiencing systemic illness in mid-to-late pregnancy. The standard labelled or 'single 'dose of altrenogest for suppressing oestrus is 0.044 mg/kg bwt per os q. 24 h. In casesof severe maternal disease, most practitioners initiate a'double dose 'of 0.088 mg/kg bwt per os q. 24 h as used in the study by Daels et al. (1996). The length of treatment required varies on a case-by-case basis. Many practitioners administer a double dose of altrenogest before decreasing to a single dose in mid- to late-term pregnant mares whose medical disease has resolved and in which the pregnancy appears stable (Lu, 2012). Injectable altrenogest and long- acting progesterone in oil (1500 mg i.m. q. 7-14 days) formulations are also available that may be administered intramuscularly on a weekly to biweekly basis, providing an avenue of administration in mares who are unable to receive oral medications whether due to administrator preference, mare cooperation or concurrent maternal disease (McKinnon et al., 2000; Vanderwall et al., 2007). A recent study also examined the pharmacokinetics of rectally administered altrenogest and found that due to rectal bioavailability, administration of 0.088 mg/kg bwt every 4 -8 h would be required to reach acceptable therapeutic levels (Ellis et al.,2019). The question of whether and when to discontinue progestin therapy remains a challenging discussion amongst practitioners and owners alike. In the face of continued systemic or reproductive insult, progestin therapy is often continued until parturition. In cases of elective administration, or cases of maternal medical disease, many practitioners recommend performing a gradual taper of the amount administered over the course of at least 10 -14 days to allow the endogenous endocrine system to adapt; however, no studies have shown a direct adverse effect to sudden progestin drop (Kelleman, 2013; Perkins, 1999). As altrenogest does not cross-react with progesterone assays, endogenous progesterone or total progestogen concentration, depending on the stage of gestation, may be assessed on routine progesterone assays prior to discontinuation (Jackson et al., 1986). This is contrary to injectable progesterone formulations, as both endogenous and exogenous progesterone would be detected on assay analysis, limiting its usefulness. Timing of a gradual taper may be performed after con rmation of acceptable endogenous progesterone levels in stablepregnancies as discussed above, after the fetoplacental unit becomes functional at 100 -120 days of gestation, or at approximately 320 days of gestation due to possible sideeffects of chronic administration (Conley & Ball, 2019; Kelleman, 2013; Lu, 2012). Mares treated with altrenogest after 280 days of gestation until foaling displayed prolonged stage II of parturition, and foals exhibited lower respiratory rates, higher blood pH, altered neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and possible increased need for advanced supportive care (Neuhauser et al., 2008, 2009).

Anti-in flammatories Nonsteroidal anti-in flammatories are commonly used to assist in pregnancy maintenance in addition to their use as therapy for many underlying primary disease processes. Anti- inflammatory therapy aims at reducing and halting the pro- inflammatory response and production of in flammatory cytokines and prostaglandins, as each has been implicated in preterm labour and abortion in horses as well as a multitudeof other species (LeBlanc et al., 2012). Anti-in flammatory therapy may also serve as an anti-endotoxic agent oranalgesic in appropriate cases. meglumine (1.1 mg/kg bwt i.v. or h) or phenylbutazone (2.2 mg/kg bwt i.v. or per os q. 12 h).Supporting administration in cases of maternal medical disease, the nonsteroidal cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor flunixin meglumine has been shown in early gestation to maintainprogesterone levels and promote pregnancy maintenance in an experimental model of endotoxaemia (Daels et al., 1991a, b). When flunixin meglumine was administered to mares between 21 and 44 days of gestation before endotoxinadministration, all mares (7/7) maintained pregnancy. When administered following endotoxin administration, systemic progesterone declined, and pregnancy was lost in 1/3 mares at one hour and 3/3 mares at two hours respectively (Daels et al., 1991b). Recently, the primarily COX-2-selective anti-in flammatory rocoxib has been investigated in the pregnant (Gigu /C18ere et al., 2016; Macpherson et al., 2021) as rocoxib ideally has less deleterious effects on the gastrointestinal and renal systems. Initial work illustrated no adverse effects in mares treated with daily oral rocoxib at 0.1 mg/kg bwt, but the maximum concentration of the drug was signi cantly lower in pregnant mares (Gigu /C18ere et al., 2016). As rocoxib has a long half-life, the authors proposed that a steady statein pregnant mares could be reached by using a loading dose of 0.3 mg/kg bwt followed by 0.1 mg/kg bwt by mouth every 24 h akin to the practice performed in other musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal conditions in the horse (Cox et al., 2013; Gigu /C18ere et al., 2016). Macpherson and colleagues (2021) followed this work by using the loadingdose of 0.3 mg/kg bwt per os q. 24 h, followed by 0.1 mg/kgbwt per os q. 24 h in an experimental model of ascending placentitis. Compared with untreated infected animals, mares who received rocoxib demonstrated reduced concentrations of multiple in flammatory cytokines and prostaglandins within the allantoic fluid (Macpherson et 2021). Therefore, rocoxib may serve as a bene cial therapeutic in mares requiring prolonged anti-in flammatory therapy for the treatment of their primary disease process. Pentoxifylline is an immune modulator that is believed to have multifactorial actions, including preventing the releaseof in flammatory cytokines, enhancing uterine blood flow and diminishing adhesion (Heller et al., 1999; Lauterbach& Zemballa, 1996; Ousey et al., 2010). However, a recent study by Bailey and colleagues was unable to detect any improvement in uterine arterial blood flow through Doppler ultrasonography in pregnant mares when treated with pentoxifylline at 17 mg/kg bwt per os q. 24 h daily (Baileyet al., 2012). Regardless of the mechanism of action, in aseparate ef cacy study, an improved pregnancy outcome occurred in an experimental model of placentitis, whencombination therapy of pentoxifylline was used in conjunction with trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole and altrenogest (Bailey et al., 2010). Therefore, pentoxifylline continues to be used inmany cases of ascending placentitis and may serve a similar purpose in cases of maternal medical disease. Finally, acetylsalicylic acid or aspirin is another anti- inflammatory agent (50 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h) that is clinically gaining favour with some practitioners for use inpregnancy maintenance. In women, acetylsalicylic acid is known to inhibit platelet aggregation, thereby increasing blood flow, and is used to prevent pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growthrestriction (Meher et al., 2017; Sibai et al., 1989; Vainio et al., 2002). Akin to pentoxifylline, recent investigations have examined its effects as a rheostatic agent via Doppler ultrasonography and found that in late pregnancy, the total arterial blood flow was signi cantly higher in mares receiving acetylsalicylic acid compared with controls (Sielhorst et al.,2018). Its use has also been investigated in a single ef cacy study, where Christiansen and co-workers (2010) administeredacetylsalicylic acid, trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole and altrenogest in an experimental model of ascending placentitisand produced 9 out of 12 viable foals in treated mares. Tocolytics The use of tocolytics such as b-sympathomimetics, calcium channel blockers, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors andmagnesium sulphate to suppress uterine contractions are a crucial part of multimodal therapy to treat preterm labour in women (Rundell & Panchal, 2017). In pregnant mares, limited research has been performed with varied results. To date, the b- sympathomimetic clenbuterol has received the most attention.Card and Wood (1995) rst illustrated that administration of 300\u00b5g of intravenous clenbuterol at varied gestational stages decreased appreciated transrectal uterine tone for up to 120 min alongside maternal and fetal heart rate elevations. However, when administered at multiple dosages prior to foaling in another study, clenbuterol could not prolong natural parturition and potentially even caused treated mares to foal earlier than untreated controls (Palmer et al., 2002). This contrary effect was hypothesised to be due to cervical dilation following relaxation of the cervical smooth musculature that may haveresulted in a hastening of parturition. Therefore, due to the varied and possible detrimental results against pregnancy maintenance, tocolytic use remains limited in the clinical setting. Nutrition Nutritional support is as a critical part of supporting apregnant mare and addressing the primary disease process (Dolente, 2004). Nutritional requirements of the pregnant broodmare increase dramatically during late gestation, where mares require up to 1.3 -1.5 times the adult maintenance requirements for energy and protein (NationalResearch Council, 2007; Robles et al., 2021). Additionally, in a study by Silver and colleagues, experimental fasting in the pregnant mare was shown to increase the concentration of a prostaglandin metabolite along with possible premature delivery (Silver, 1982). Nutritional supplementation, therefore, \u00a92022 The Authors.

Acupuncture and acupressure Acupuncture is gaining interest amongst veterinary cliniciansand owners alike for its potential to serve as adjunctive therapy for pregnancy maintenance. While to date, no controlled studies have been performed in pregnant mares, the use of both acupuncture and acupressure has been investigated as methods to both stimulate and inhibit labour in women in addition to its use as a source of nonpharmaceutical analgesia during parturition (Gentz, 2001; Tseui et al., 1977). In pregnant rats, a study by Pak et al. (2000) illustrated signi cant suppression of oxytocin-induced uterine contractions following stimulation of the acupoint LI-4.While speci c studies have not shown a direct link between its performance and iatrogenic abortion, due to the dualityof possible points to cause both the induction of labour and promotion of uterine quiescence, caution is recommended with its performance only by experienced and trained practitioners (Scho eld, 2008; Shmalberg & Xie, 2011). Conclusions In conclusion, multiple ancillary measures may be initiated to support gestational health in cases of maternal medical disease. Regardless of the ongoing disease process and supportive measures elected, frequent assessment of fetoplacental health should be performed to assess response to treatment and prevent maintenance of a nonviable pregnancy.

During assessment, one infrequently encounters a triangular-shaped articular indentation of the articular surface of the distal phalanx (P3). To the authors 'knowledge, there are no detailed radiographic or MRI descriptions of this speci c articular indentation in the literature so far. Objectives: The main purpose of this study was to give a detailed morphological description of this radiographicalidenti ed articular indentation. study. Methods: All LM and DP radiographs of the feet of horses presented at our hospital between August 2016 and August2019 were retrospectively reviewed for presence of an articular indentation. Following selection, patient information, patient history, clinical ndings, MRI- nding and surgical details were retrieved. In total, 30 horses were included of which 12 underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Radiographs and MRI results were evaluated for the precise location, shape and extent of the articular indentation and for signs of degenerative joint disease of the DIPJ. Results: Four different indentation types were identi ed radiographically. Concomitant low eld MRI proved to be a useful and excellent imaging modality for evaluation of this rare articular indentation and its surrounding subchondral bone. MRI ndings were various and ranged from slight subchondral contour deviations to obvious OCLL(Osseous Cyst Like Lesions). Furthermore, MRI identi ed some additional indentation related OCLLs that were notnoted on plain radiographs. Main limitations: The limited number of horses that were included and the absence of complementaryhistopathology. Conclusions: Articular indentations are typically identi ed in the third quarter of the articular margin of P3 and may haveunderlying OCLLs. Since OCLLs are known to be a potential cause of future unsoundness, careful radiographic assessment is advised if an indentation is encountered. If needed, Standing Low-Field MRI can give additional and detailed information.Clinical relevance This study describes the infrequently encountered triangular-shaped articular indentation of the articular surface of the distal phalanx on the LM view of the foot. Articular indentations may communicate withunderlying osseous cyst like lesions, therefore careful assessment of both LM and DP views is strongly advised. Long-term prognosis still needs to be determined. Introduction In equine veterinary practice lateromedial (LM) radiographs of the distal phalanx (P3) are routinely obtained for lameness diagnostics and pre-purchase purposes. Multiple pathological conditions affecting the distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ) have been described, such as extensor process fragments, sepsis, osteoarthritis and osseous cyst-like lesions (OCLLs) (Butler et al., 2008). OCLLs, also referred to as subchondral cystic lesions or subchondral bone cysts, are common in horses (F \u20acurst et al., 1997; Garcia-Lopez & Kirker-Head, 2004). Butler et al. (2008) reported the presence of a smoothly outlined V-shaped notch ( Fig 1 ) in the middle of the articular margin of P3 on standard LM radiographs that clearly differed from the articular irregularity which is commonly seen with extensor process OCLLs. This speci c V-shaped notch, also referred to as an articular indentation, was reported to be acoincidental nding with presumably minimal clinical signi cance. Recently, Peter et al. (2018) assessed the association of radiographically identi ed OCLLs of P3 with lameness and racing performance in Thoroughbredracehorses. In some (36%) of these horses, the radiographic identi ed OCLL was associated with an articular indentation of the distal phalanx. However, since detailed information about the exact location and speci c morphology of the articular indentation is lacking, its clinical signi cance remains unknown. Osseous cyst-like lesions usually arise in the subchondral bone of the main weight-bearing surface of the joint and maycause future lameness (Baxter, 1996; Dyson et al., 2005; (26.2%) are the second most commonly affected (von Rechenberg et al., 1998). Radiographically, OCLLs of the weight-bearing surface of the DIPJ are most easily visualised on dorsopalmar or dorsoproximal -palmarodistal oblique views (Butler et al., 2008; Peter et al., 2018). However, multiple factors impede theradiographic identi cation of small or early-stage OCLLs. First, bone mineral density must change by approximately 30 -50% before osseous lesions become radiologically apparent (Butleret al., 2008; Konde, 1998). Second, signi cant superposition (as a result of irregular joint contours, anatomic variation anddifferent bone densities) may further complicate correct identi cation. Finally, the centre of the frog may create a lucency that mimics the presence of an OCLL (Butler et al.,2008; Story & Bramlage, 2004; Trotter & Dyson, 2003; Von Suntum & Hartung, 1989). Therefore, recognition of early stage or small OCLLs remains challenging when radiography alone is used. For subtle and complicated cases, complementary techniques, such as MRI and computed tomography (CT), are warranted (Dyson et al., 2003; Mair & Sherlock, 2008; Sch \u20acon et al., 2017; Young et al., 2012). Our purpose was to 1) describe the different shapes and precise location of the infrequent indentation of the articularmargin of the DIPJ on plain LM radiographs of the equine foot; 2) to describe correlating MR imaging ndings of this speci c indentation and 3) to try to elucidate the clinical importance of this rare radiographic nding. Materials and methods Study population and study design For this study, all radiographs of the feet of horses presentedat our hospital between August 2016 and August 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Radiographs were obtained using two different digital radiographic systems, a Konica Minolta DR-system (Veterinary Solutions), using standard settings of 70 kV/4 mAs for the LM views and 60 kV/20 mAsfor dorsopalmar views. 1683 LM radiographs of 1041 horses were retrospectively reviewed. Horses were only selected for inclusion if (1) a distinct subchondral indentation of the articular margin of the distal (DIPJ) was observed on the LM radiographs ( Fig 1 ) and if (2) the radiographs were of suf cient diagnostic quality that allowed accurate measurement taking. Finally, 30 horses met the selection criteria. Images were stored and reviewed in DICOM format. Following selection, case information, case history, clinical ndings, MRI ndings (if present) and surgical details were retrieved ( Table 1 ). Twelve of the 30 horses underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance ndings ofve horses were retrospectively reviewed as MRI was performed as part of the lameness examination. The remaining seven horses underwent a prospective MRI using a speci c study-based protocol. Four horses had both feet examined (16 feet scanned in total). Radiographic assessment All radiographs were reviewed by one specialist radiologist(N.H.) and one surgical resident (S.F.). Radiographs were evaluated for extent and shape of the articular indentation of the articular surface of P3 and for signs of degenerative joint disease of the DIPJ. Once consensus was reached, radiographic identi ed indentations were classi ed into four different types: Type 1: a small or broad, shallow or deep,angulated to curved or triangular articular indentation without fragmentation; Type 2: a small or broad, shallow or deep, angulated to curved or triangular articular indentation with fragmentation; Type 3: a small or triangular articular indentation with a subchondral osseous cyst-like lesion; Type 4: small or triangular articular indentation with a Table 1 ). Subsequently, the degree of DIPJ osteoarthritis was subjectively assessed and classi ed into four different categories ( Table 2 ). Once all LM radiographs were reviewed, all available and correspondingdorsopalmar/dorsoplantar views were evaluated for presence of any radiolucency potentially related to the articular indentation. Following identi cation on the dorsopalmar views, the position of the articular indentation in thelateromedial plane was determined. Next, using the LM view, the exact position of the articular indentation in the sagittal plane was determined. Measurements were taken and processed by one author (S.F.), using a geometric program, Geogebra Classic (GeoGebra GmbH). First, the distance from the extensor process until thearticular indentation was measured (Distance 1 (D1)) followed by the total length of the articular margin of P3 (Distance 2 (D2)) ( Fig 3 ). Next, the exact location of the articular indentation was calculated using a D1:D2 ratio ( Table 1 ). Magnetic resonance imaging and assessment MRI was performed under sedation using a 0.27 Tesla standing MRI unit (Hallmarq Veterinary Imaging) with a dedicated extremity radiofrequency coil. Five horses underwent MRI examination because of unrelated foot Fig 1: Type 1 articular indentation of the distal phalanx. \u00a92022 22/11/22 5:33 PMTABLE 1: Clinical, radiographic and MRI ndings in 30 horses.

This protocol consisted of a T2 *W sagittal, T2 *W transverse in digital flexor tendon (DDFT) proximal to the navicular bone, STIR sagittal, T2* W frontal on a right angle to the distal DDFT, T2W FSE transverse parallel to the floor, STIR transverse parallel to the floor, T2W FSE frontal parallel to the axis of the foot, T2W FSE frontal on a right-angle to the bone, parallel to thedorsal border of P3 and T1W frontal High Resolution or T1W 3D GRE frontal parallel to the flexor cortex of the navicular bone. In three of these ve cases, additional sequences were conducted to investigate the articular indentation, T1W 3D sagittal and T1W 3D sagittal ISO. Seven horses underwent prospective MRI using a speci c designed study protocol that consisted of the following T2 *W both parallel to the articular indentation. When possible, the frontal plane sequences were speci cally aligned to be parallel to the defect to best assess the depth of the defect. In cases where the defectcon guration was less distinct, a standard frontal plane orientation parallel to the axis of the foot was obtained. Following MR scanning, the images were evaluated using a DICOM viewing software (RadiAnt DICOM Viewer). The sizeof the articular indentation was de ned on the sagittal images of the T1W 3D ISO, which typically has a small slice thickness and separation (0.9 mm and 0.9 mm) combined with a high lesion contrast. In two retrospective cases, in a total of three feet the T1W 3D ISO was not performed, and the measurements were performed on the T2 *W sagittal with a slice thickness of 0.77 mm and separation of 0.77 mm. Thesubchondral bone was subjectively evaluated for sclerosis and the presence of a concomitant cyst-like lesion with or without connection to the articular indentation. Results In total, 30 horses ( Table 1 ) were included with a mean age of 8.5 years old (range: 1 -21 years). Articular indentationswere identi ed in only 2.9% (30/1041) of the investigated horses and in only 2.7% (45/1683) of all reviewed LMradiographs. The included study population consisted of 16 Warmbloods, 12 Friesians, 1 Ha flinger horse and 1 Appaloosa horse. Friesians were clearly overrepresented as the standardhospital 's population consists of only 13% Friesians. The remaining breeds, however, mimicked the hospital 's (59% Warmbloods, 2% Ha flinger horses and 11 geldings, 7 stallions and 12mares. In 50% of the horses (15/30), the articular indentation was identi ed in only one front limb. In the remaining 50% of the horses (15/30), the articular indentations were identi ed in both front (14/15) and hindlimbs (1/15). Based on the nature of this study, no reliable comparison between limbs could be made. Male horses were slightly overrepresented with 18/30 (60%). A total of 17/30 horses were presented with variable degrees of lameness. Following diagnostic anaesthesia, lameness was localised to the foot in 12 horses. Seven horses had signi cant pathology affecting the DIPJ which rendered additional intra-articular anaesthesia unnecessary, such aslarge extensor process fragmentation (3/7), process fragmentation (1/7), III P3 fracture (1/7), Type VI P3 fracture (1/7) and severe osteoarthritis of the DIPJ (1/7). Other causes of foot lameness unrelated to the DIPJ were various and consisted of canker, impar severe pododermatitis. Lameness unrelated to the foot were caused by osteoarthritis of the proximointerphalangealjoint (PIPJ), osteoarthritis of the radiocarpal joint (RCJ) and septic tenosynovitis of the carpal sheath. The cause of lameness remained unde ned in two horses. The remaining 13 horses were presented for complete pre-purchaseexamination and were all sound during the clinical examination. All 45 articular indentations, identi ed on the reviewed lateromedial radiographs, were categorised into four different indentation types Fig 2a-d ,Table 1 ). Thirty- six were classi ed as Type 1, 1 as Type 2, 6 as Type 3 and 2 as Type 4. A total of 12/15 cases that had bilateral indentations were diagnosed with a similar indentation type in the contralateral foot. Only 3/15 cases (Nr. 9, Nr. 21, Nr. 28) were diagnosed with different indentation types in the contralateral foot. Distribution differed slightly between breeds ( Fig 4 ). Type 1 articular indentations were more frequently identi ed in Friesian horses, while Types 2, 3 and 4 were only seen inWarmbloods. Interestingly, 6/7 horses with a Type 3 or Type 4 indentation were presented for general pre-purchase examination and were all sound. The Type 3 indentation in the remaining horse (Case Nr. 21, septic carpal tenosynovitis) was identi ed during standard clinical work-up. Furthermore, none of the corresponding radiographs (of the horses with aType 3 or Type 4 indentation) showed any signs of degenerative joint disease. It is worthy to note, however, that all horses with a Type 3 and/or Type 4 were young horses (range 2 -7 years), most of them at the beginning of their athletic career. In total, 36 corresponding dorsopalmar (DP)views were available for radiographic assessment. On only 23/36 DP views, a poorly de ned and sagittal located lucency, potentially related to the articular indentation, was identi ed within the articular margin of the distal phalanx. All Type 3 and Type 4 indentations were consistently found onTABLE 2: Categorisation of DIP joint osteoarthritis.

Spryng with OsteoCushion Technology is a veterinary medical device by PetVivo, Inc. With a single injection of Spryng with OsteoCushion Technology, you have the power to simply, effectively and economically manage lameness and joint issues. Spryng with OsteoCushion Technology is an innovative veterinary medical device that takes the treatment of lameness issues into a new arena by addressing the root cause of the conditions \u2014 missing and damaged cartilage. Spryng aids in the management of joint pain from the loss of cartilage or tissue-bone mechanical malfunction caused by joint disfunction. When injected into the joint, Spryng creates a sponge-like, shock-absorbing matrix \u2014 that works with synovial fluid to mimic the protective form and function of natural, healthy joint cartilage. When a horse jumps, runs or performs any movement with joint impact, Spryng absorbs and releases synovial fluid in response, with elastic stiffness that complements natural synovial fluid and cartilage dynamics. Spryng also provides a natural scaffold, potentially protecting the joint from further injury, unlike other lameness management options that may only mask symptoms.SIMPLE Single injection with rapid results LONG LASTING Long duration of joint protection INNOVATIVE Address the affliction \u2014 helps to restore proper joint mechanics Manage lameness and joint issues with issues with A VETERINARY MEDICAL DEVICELONG LASTING Long duration of joint protection Learn more and order SpryngHealth.com Also available at EVE_December22_Text_Print.pdf 30 22/11/22 5:33 PMboth LM and DP views. The remaining types, however, were inconsistently identi ed on the DP view. Osteoarthritic changes of the DIPJ were found in only 12/ 45 (26.7%) LM radiographs of the feet that were diagnosed with an articular indentation of the distal phalanx. Severity of changes varied between mild (7/12), moderate (3/12) and severe (2/12) ( Table 2 ). The mean distance (D1:D2) from process until articular of Mean differed slightly between breeds, namely, 65.7% in the Friesianhorse group, 64.2% in the Warmblood horse group, 73% in the Haflinger horse group and 57% in the Appaloosa horse group. Mean distance also differed slightly between indentationtypes, namely, 63.3% for Type 1 indentations, 62.0% for Type 2indentations, 63.2% for Type 3 indentations and 68.5% for Type 4 indentations. Following assessment of the prospective and retrospective retrieved MRI images, the articular indentation was found to be consistently located in the mid-sagittal (medial to lateral) plane and in the centre (from dorsal to palmar and medial to lateral) of the ( Fig 2a-d ).

The lateromedial size of the articular indentations ranged from 0.8 mm to 9.0 mm. Assessment of the surrounding sclerosis subjectively varied from mild to severe, with severe sclerosisonly visible in combination with the larger articular indentations. All radiographic types were evaluated by MRI scanning. Low- eld MRI was able to identify several indentations related OCLLs that were not visible on the standard lateromedialradiographs of the foot. In total, six OCLLs were identi ed of which only three (Nr. 25, Nr. 27 and Nr. 28) wereradiographically classi ed as a Type 3. The remaining three were radiographically scored as a Type 1 (Nr. 4, Nr. 16 andNr. 18). Five were located in the middle of the articular surface on the sagittal image and had a clear communication with the radiographically visible articular indentation (Type 3). In one foot (Nr. 16), the OCLL was located dorsal to the indentation, but low- eld MRI failed to identify a clear communication with the DIPJ. One horse (Nr.4) had a rounded region in the sclerotic bone adjacent to the indentation in the subchondral bone. On T1 W, T2 *W and T2 FSE, it consisted of a hypointense rim with a centreisointense to the medullary bone without an increased signal on STIR images. This was evaluated as an OCLL because of its shape and location, without a central fluid content. Moreover, none of the corresponding STIR images showedevidence of bone oedema surrounding the OCLL. The cartilage layer overlying the indentation was mainly evaluated with the anatomical T1 GRE sagittal weightedsequence and was interpreted as abnormal in seven cases, i.e., having an irregular cartilage surface (Nr. 10, Nr. 14b and Nr. 16) or a decreased signal (Nr. 1, Nr. 25, Nr. 27 and Nr. 28) (Table 3 ). The small fragment overlying the articular indentation in Type 4 articular indentations was identi ed in one horse (Nr. 28) using the T1W 3D sagittal ISO sequence. In two horses (Nr. 4 and Nr. 18), however, no cartilage abnormalities were found despite the presence of an OCLL. MRI evaluation generally indicated the presence of more severe signs of joint disease in most cases than what was identi ed radiographically ( Table 3 ). However, in three cases (Nr. 1, Nr. 14 and Nr. 15), the degree of joint disease wasfound to be similar to the radiographic OA grade. Additional joint pathologies identi ed were an extensor process fracture, Type III P3 fracture, an OCLL in the opposing subchondralbone of the second phalanx. Discussion This article describes the exact location of a relatively rare indentation of the articular margin of P3 seen on plain LM radiographs of the equine foot. Articular indentations were typically identi ed in the third quarter (from dorsal to palmar/plantar, range 54% -76%) of P3. Radiographically, only eight articular indentations (Types mild-to-moderate subchondral i.e., subchondral cystic lesions (OCLLs). One Type 3 (Nr. 25) and two Type 4 (Nr. 27 and Nr. 28) radiographic identi ed indentations underwent complementary MRI examination. MRI con rmed the presence of the three radiographically diagnosed OCLLs and identi ed the presence of three additional OCLLs in cases where thearticular indentation was radiographically categorised with the radiographicallyvisible articular indentation. The main purpose of this study was to give a detailed morphological description of the articular indentation of the articular margin of the distal phalanx. Therefore, the exact aetiopathogenesis of this speci c radiographic identi able articular indentation remains unclear. Based on its consistentintra-articular localisation and potential communication with underlying OCLLs (Type 3 and Type 4), a similar etiopathogenesis as opted for true OCLLs seems likely. Common reported hypotheses for OCLLs are developmental diseases (such as osteochondrosis), local trauma and focal osteolysis as a result of sepsis (Sherlock & Mair, 2011; Von Rechenberg et al., 1998). In this study, however, by using case 's history, local trauma and sepsis was excluded as possible inciting causes for the development of articulardamage. Therefore, the authors believe that developmental diseases, such as osteochondrosis, could form a possible explanation for the development of the indentation. However, as the number of horses and breeds included in this study were small and no histopathology was performed in any of these cases, this merely remains a hypothesis that still needs to be proven. Histopathology is necessary to differentiate between the different inciting causes. The articular indentations investigated in this study were encountered equally in Warmbloods and Friesian horses. In the Netherlands, around 7% of the horse population are Friesians (Van Vliet & Back, 2006), and even though ourhospital 's caseload comprises a higher percentage of Friesian horses (13%), the Friesian breed seemed clearlyoverrepresented in this study (40%). Furthermore, it is noteworthy to mention that all Type 3 and Type 4 articular indentations were identi ed in Warmblood horses only. In Literature, Thoroughbreds and Warmblood horses havefrequently been reported to be overrepresented for the development of phalangeal cysts (Haack et al., 1983; Story & Bramlage, 2004; al., 1998). The vast majority (43/45) of articular indentations were identi ed in the front-feet. This unequal distribution could be partially explained by the inclusion of multiple pre-purchaseexaminations, as radiographic screening of the hind feet was not standard in our clinic. Additionally, 17 of the 30 horses were referred for lameness work-up of which 16 were diagnosed having a front limb lameness. To date, the exact clinical signi cance of the different articular indentation types remains unclear. True OCLLs of P3, on the other hand, are frequently associated with variable lameness degrees (Butler et al., 2008; McIlwraith, 1990; Trotter & Dyson, 2003). Lameness has been attributed to persistent synovitis and degenerative joint disease (Butler et al., 2008), an increased pressure in the subchondral bone or cyst, or a combination of one of these (Kold & Hickman, 1986). Furthermore, subsequent cavitation of the surrounding bone could potentially lead to a pathological fracture (Scott et al., 1991). Recently, Peter and colleagues (2018) reported on DIPJ lameness in Thoroughbred racehorses caused by an OCLL of P3. In eight cases, an associated indentation in the articular surface of P3 could be identi ed on the lateromedial or oblique projections. In contrast to Peter et al. (2018), noclear relationship between the indentation and lameness was found in this study, as 43% (13/30) of the horses wereadmitted for standard prepurchase examinations and were sound at presentation. Interestingly, all horses with a \u00a92022 EVJ Ltd632 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION articular indentation and concomitant OCLL (Type 3 and Type 4) were sound (6/7 horses) or had pathology unrelated to the foot (1/7 horses). Lameness in the remaining 17 horses was reported to be caused by a variety of pathologic conditions other than the articular indentation. However, as no intra-articular anaesthesia was performed in any of these cases, no de nitive conclusions regarding the clinical relevance could be made. Multiple studies have reported on the use of MRI and CT for assessment of OCLLs of P3 (Mair & Sherlock, 2008; Sch \u20acon et al., 2017; Sherlock & Mair, 2011). To the author 's knowledge, however, none have speci cally focused on the articular indentation which is described in this paper. Despitethe superior image resolution of high- eld MR scanners, low- eld MR imaging has been used for the detection of full thickness and severe cartilage alterations in the DIPJ (Olive, 2010). Subtle and partial thickness defects, on the other hand, are dif cult or even impossible to detect with low- eld MR systems (Van Zadelhoff et al., 2019). By using a low- eld MR scanner, cartilage abnormalities were found in only 41% of the cases scanned in this study. Besides the detection of cartilage abnormalities, low- eld MR was capable to identify subchondral bone sclerosis surrounding the articularindentation in all cases. In this study, cartilage abnormalities were most frequently identi ed on T1W 3D ISO and T1 GRE sagittal weighted sequences. This study provides a detailed radiographic description with correlating MRI ndings of a rare indentation of the articular surface of P3. Four different indentation types were identi ed radiographically. Concomitant MRI ndings were varied and ranged from slight subchondral contourdeviations to clear articular indentations with related OCLLs. Low- eld MRI has, despite its limitations, proven to be a useful and excellent imaging modality for evaluation of this rarearticular indentation and its surrounding subchondral and trabecular bone. Although none of the lamenesses seemed directly related with the articular indentation, the true clinical relevance remains unclear at this time as no intra-articularanaesthesia or long-term follow-up was performed. Nevertheless, intra-articular fragmentation and OCLLs, whether or not communicating with the synovial cavity, are known to potentially initiate synovitis, osteoarthritis and future lameness. Therefore, it seems rational, however, to assume that horses with a radiological visible OCLLs (Type 3 and Type 4) or an indentation in combination with a fragment (Type 2) are at an increased risk for future unsoundness. Theauthors of this study, therefore, do recommend careful assessment of the LM and upright pedal view when articular indentations are encountered. Since OCLLs are easily missed with radiography alone, additional MRI is advised in horses with a radiographic visible articular indentation and proven DIPJ lameness. Additional studies are necessary to investigate the exact aetiology of the articular indentation, the risk for progression of one type into another and its potential for initiating osteoarthritis and subsequent lameness.

M. Nieman* and D. S. Chan WinStar Farm, Versailles, Kentucky, USA; andEpona Biotech Institute of Technology Campus, Sligo, Ireland *Corresponding author email: nniemandvm@winstarfarm.com N. M. Nieman Present address: WinStar Farm, Versailles, Kentucky, USA D. S. Chan Present address: Epona Biotech, Institute of Technology Campus, Sligo, serum amyloid cell count; immunoglobulin G Summary Background Acute-phase proteins (APPs) have diagnostic value as nonspeci c, early indicators of in flammation and infectious disease. Objectives To assess the ability of serum amyloid A (SAA) testing to distinguish between healthy and nonhealthy newborn foals, and to compare the diagnostic predictability of SAA with white blood cell (WBC) counts and serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration. Study design Three-year prospective clinical evaluation and diagnostic sample collection from newborn foals. Methods Following an examination, a blood sample was obtainedfrom each foal and tested for SAA and IgG concentrations, complete blood count (CBC) and standard biochemistry values. Foals were categorised as healthy or nonhealthy based on the clinical examination. The presence of clinical signs of infectious origin or certain noninfectious morbidities with a pro-in flammatory component was suf cient nonhealthy designation. Serum amyloid A, IgG and WBC testresults were determined and compared for healthy and nonhealthy foals. Results A total of 24 (13.7%) foals were diagnosed as clinically sick and 151 (86.3%) as normal based on physical examinationsperformed within 24 h after parturition. Mean SAA values were 27.7 /C6129.0 mg/L and 247.2 mg/L a signi cant ( p<0.05) difference indicating that elevated SAA values are associated with a nonhealthy diagnosis. Using a positive threshold of 100 mg/L, the SAA test had a positive predictive value (PPV) of55.6% and IgG had the lowest PPV (16.7%) followed by WBC count (23.3%). Main limitations A larger number of clinically nonhealthy foals with SAA levels>100 would have given the study greater statistical power. Conclusions Equine practitioners can consider SAA testing to be a reliablenewborn examination diagnostic tool for detecting early- onset, acute-phase infection or noninfectious morbidities with an in flammatory component. Clinical relevance Serum amyloid A screening functioned as a sensitive interpretive marker of infectious and other inflammatory morbidities in neonatal foals, a high-risk equine population that potentially bene ts from early therapeutic intervention.

Dantino's present address: Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine, Knoxville, Tennessee, USA Keywords: horse; anaesthesia; pulse oximetry; oxygen saturation; accuracy Summary Background Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive method for continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation (SpO 2) and pulse rate (PR) used in equine anaesthesia. Despite species differences inthe oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve, pulse oximeters validated for humans are commonly used in veterinary medicine. These devices are expensive and at an increased risk for damage when used for equine anaesthesia. Human ngertip pulse oximeters (FPO) may be useful as an inexpensive alternative to standard devices. Objectives Evaluate accuracy and repeatability of FPOs applied to tongues of anaesthetised horses breathing >90% oxygen. Study design Prospective clinical study. Methods Duplicate SpO 2and PR measurements from eight pulse oximeters (PO; seven FPOs and reference PO) placed in random order on tongues of horses under inhalational anaesthesia were recorded. A standard portable PO (RPO) was used as reference SpO 2and invasive blood pressure trace or manual pulse palpation as reference PR. Non-parametric Bland-Altman analysis was performed. Acceptable coef cient of repeatability value was 6% SpO 2. Agreements were accepted if limits of agreement were /C63% difference in SpO 2and /C610% relative difference in PR. Only PR values between 25 and 50 beats per minute andtheir corresponding SpO 2measurements were used for agreement analysis.Results SpO 2repeatability and agreement were unacceptable for all devices. The agreement of PR measurements was acceptable for one FPO and the RPO. Main limitations Utilisation of devices designed for the humanoxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve, high number of absent or erroneous readings, use of healthy horses, small sample size, unavailability of co-oximetry, lack of a desaturation protocol and dif culty with proper placement of FPOs on horse tongues are all considered limitations in this study. Conclusions Accuracy of FPOs used in anaesthe tised horses was poor. Their use in equine anaesthesia for SpO 2monitoring is not recommended, but some models may be considered for continuous PRmonitoring in conjunction with intermittent manual con rmation. Clinical relevance SpO 2and pulse rate should be monitored in horses during general anaesthesia and the recovery period,especially in eld settings when oxygen supplementation is not typically provided. Pulse oximeters are expensive, and a clinician may notchoose to use one due to risk of damage of equipment. A lower cost option may reduce the concern for damage. This study demonstrates that human FPOs placed onhorse tongues do not accurately measure SpO 2but certain models may be suitable to monitor pulse rate.Based on ndings in this study, their use as a monitor in horses under inhalant anaesthesia is limited. Article In vitro flow rates through ve different catheters intended for intravenous use in horses at two different heights S. Lord,*, J. Duncan, M. Gozalo-Marcillaand K. Woodhouse Veterinary Clinical Sciences, The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies and The Roslin Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Midlothian; andSchool of Medicine, Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK *Corresponding author email: slord@ed.ac.uk Keywords: horse; fluid therapy; colic; anaesthesia Background Fluid therapy is an important component of equine practice. The choice of intravenous catheter is likely to impact fluid flow rates which is of relevance in clinical cases. Objectives (i) To assess fluid flow rates through ve different equine catheters; (ii) to evaluate the impact of height on fluid flow rates and (iii) to compare agreement of flow rates achieved through identical catheters. Study design In vitro experimental study. Methods Flow rates were measured through ve different equine catheters (2 914, 13, 12 and 10-gauge) at 150 and 200 cm from ground level. Each catheter was attached to astandardised fluid administration system, and time taken to reach 1000 g of fluids was measured. Three of each catheter were used to assess the agreement between identical catheters. Statistical analysis: (i) one-way ANOVA assessed whether catheter type in fluenced flow rate and a post hoc Tukey 's test compared mean flow rates to all other flow rates; (ii) two-way ANOVA assessed whether height and catheter type in fluenced the flow rate. Finally, (iii) an intraclass correlation assessed how closely flow rates from identical catheters resembled each other. Results (i) The fastest mean flow rates were achieved through the 10- gauge catheter at 150 (14.1 L/h) and 200 cm (17.8 L/h). (ii)Mean flow rates through all ve catheters increased by a range of 25.4 -28.6% at 200 vs. 150 cm. (iii) There was excellent agreement between mean fluid rates through identical catheters (intraclass correlation 0.994 -0.998). Main limitations Flow rates achievable in vivo are likely to be lower. We used water which may have a different viscosity compared with fluids used commonly in equine practice. Conclusions Fluid flow rates can be increased using wider bore catheters and increasing the height of the fluid bag. There is an excellent agreement between fluid flow rates through identical catheters. Clinical relevance This article may assist the equine practitioner to choose an appropriate catheter when rapid fluid administration is required. This in vitro study will provide information on other ways to increase fluid flow rates, for example by elevating the height of the fluid bag. The results presented here will reassure equine veterinary practitioners that flow rates between identical catheters intended for use in horses are veryclosely correlated. of faecal shedding in at-risk hospitalised cases in an equine hospital in New Zealand: A pilot study H. Lambe and B. W. Sykes* School of Veterinary Science, Massey University, Palmerston diarrhoea; is an important veterinary pathogen contributing to gastrointestinal disease in horses and foals. Hospital biosecurity is an important consideration in preventing transmission between patients, and zoonotic transmission. The prevalence of salmonella in horses in equine hospitals has previously been reported in the USA and Australia. However, to date, it has not been reported in New Zealand. Objective The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of salmonella faecal shedding in at-risk patients undergoing testing by repeated faecal culture or faecal PCR in an equine hospital in New Zealand. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Medical records from a 2-year period (July 2018 -June 2020) were reviewed. Patients identi ed by the treating clinician as at-risk of salmonella, and subsequently tested with repeatedfaecal culture (at least three samples) or faecal PCR were included for analysis. Descriptive analysis was used, and prevalence data reported with 95% con dence intervals. Results Twenty-eight horses were included in the nal analysis. The overall prevalence of salmonella in the study population was 10.7% ( n=3/28, 95% CI 3.1 -25.9%).Main limitations Small sample size ( n=28) and retrospective study design provide support for further investigation. Conclusions The prevalence of salmonella in the study population iscomparable to previous reports from the USA. Further research into the prevalence and risk factors associated with faecal shedding of salmonella in hospitalised horses in New Zealand is warranted. Clinical relevance Salmonella represents a signi cant veterinary pathogen due to its contribution to potential severe gastrointestinal disease in equine patients, human health and safety concerns through zoonotic transmission, and resulting impacts to patient care and business nances. Prevalence of salmonella faecal shedding inhospitalisation is important in guiding biosecurity practices and standard operating procedures within equine hospitals. Regular audits are an essential tool to ensurecompliance with hospital biosecurity policies. s i t w w w .

W. Ramey,*and Chatsworth, California; Background Clinical and anecdotal evidence exists for the use of orally administered prednisolone in the treatment of osteoarthritis in humans; however, prednisolone is not commonly prescribed by this route of administration in horses for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Objectives This preliminary study tested the hypothesis that orally administered prednisolone could be detected in equine synovial fluid 3 h after administration. Study design Pre/post study. Methods Six horses were used in this study. Blood was drawn pre-prednisolone administration to assure that all horses were prednisolone free. Three hours after being given 400 mg prednisolone per os, an additional blood sample was taken, as well as samples from the radiocarpal (RC) and tibiotarsal (TT) joints. Samples were frozen and sent to the laboratory for determination of the presence of prednisolone using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results Prednisolone appeared in concentrations =20.33; SD =15.67 ng/ml) of all horses when tested 3 h after administration. Main limitations This study did not test for any possible therapeutic effects oforal prednisolone in osteoarthritis. It did not attempt to establish a therapeutic dosage for the medication, nor did itattempt to establish the pharmacokinetics of the medication. Conclusions Orally administered prednisolone appears in equine bloodand synovial fluid at 3 h post-administration. Since it appears in joint fluid at concentrations that have been shown to be therapeutic for other corticosteroids, orally administered prednisolone could possibly have potential value as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of equine osteoarthritis, however further studies are required to investigate this. Clinical relevance Orally administered prednisolone can be detected inequine synovial fluid 3 h after administration. Orally administered prednisolone has been shown tobe an effective treatment in human osteoarthritis.

Simon's present address: School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences Equine Health and Performance Centre, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia Keywords: horse; intussusception; outcome; retrospective; small intestine Summary Background Intussusception is an infrequent cause of equine colic, most commonly encountered in young horses. This condition occurs due to abnormalities of motility and frequently includes the caecum. Objectives The purpose of this study was to review cases of equine small intestinal (SI) intussusception excluding those with caecal involvement. Study design Case series analytical retrospective study. Methods Medical records of all horses that had SI intussusception, notinvolving the caecum, from three equine clinics between 2009 and 2020 were reviewed. Information obtained included the following: clinical parameters, surgical or necropsy ndings, complications and outcome. The Mann -Whitney U- test was used to compare outcome and complications withvarious parameters. Fisher 's exact test was used to compare short-term survival with categorical variables. Signi cance was set at p0.05. Results Twenty-six horses met the inclusion criteria. The median ageof horses was 9 months (interquartile range 2.8 months- 6.5 years). Relevant history included diarrhoea and general anaesthesia. Twenty-two out of 26 horses were diagnosed during surgery, and 4 at necropsy. During surgery, 5 horses were subjected to euthanasia, 9 underwent manual reduction, and 8 underwent resection and anastomosis. The post-operative complication rate was high at 47% and included ileus, diarrhoea and colic. The prognosis decreasedwhen the involved segment was longer ( p=0.032), lactate levels were higher ( p=0.024), and re flux was present before admission ( p=0.024). Of all horses, 53% survived to discharge; 92% of these survived for >1 year post-operatively (one case was lost to follow-up). Main limitation The retrospective nature of the study and the low number of cases included. Conclusions Small intestinal intussusception was diagnosed in horses of a variety of breeds and ages. Alterations in motility can predispose to intussusception, not only due to hypermotility (diarrhoea) but also due to hypomotility (anaesthesia). The prognosis for hospital discharge was fair; however, following hospital discharge, the long-term survival rate is high, and complications are rare. Clinical relevance This study describes the clinical presentation,signalment and aetiology of horses suffering from arare pathology, which could aid clinicians in diagnosing small intestinal intussusceptions more rapidly. High complication rates after surgical correction ofsmall intestinal intussusceptions should be expected, and those horses should be treated accordingly. Long-term prognosis found in this study is good, andlong-term complications are rare. This fact may help clinicians and owners in decision-making.

Coleridge, M. D. Klopfenstein-Breggerand C. Koch Department of Clinical Veterinary Science, Vetsuisse Faculty, Swiss Institute of Equine Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland; of a bander castration device (Callicrate Bander) to perform partial phallectomy in combination with a perineal urethrostomy (PU) has previously been described to be an effective and well-tolerated procedure in standing sedated horses. Objectives To share our experiences with the combined CallicrateBander phallectomy (CBP) and PU (CBP/PU) focusing on potential complications, outcome and owner satisfaction. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Medical records of 14 male equids that underwent CBP/PU attwo different equine referral hospitals between 2012 and 2020 were reviewed. A long-term follow-up was conducted by telephone interview with the owners using a standardised questionnaire. Results Equids underwent CBP/PU (1/ 14). Early postoperative mild and included transient post-urination haemorrhage, perineal orpreputial oedema and partial dehiscence of the PU. Complications that required further veterinary care in the immediate postoperative period occurred in one animal, which had haemorrhage at the amputation site with subsequent haematoma and oedema formation, causing moderate signs of postoperative pain. Complications encountered after discharge from the clinic comprised transient urine leakage at the amputation site, transient purulent preputial discharge, abscessation of the penileremnant and urine staining of the hind legs, tail and/or perineum. Four equids were euthanased because of tumour recurrence. Main limitations Variable case details provided in the medical records and information regarding the postoperative healing process were mainly based on owner-assessment. Conclusions CBP/PU is a well-tolerated salvage procedure for male equidswith debilitating conditions of the penis and prepuce. Severe postoperative complications are rare. If advanced stages of penile SCC are expected, careful case selection based on a rigorous preoperative examination is mandatory. Owner satisfaction with the postoperative result is high. Clinical relevance The combination of a Callicrate Bander phallectomy and a perineal urethrostomy is well tolerated in equids and allows for the removal of penile and preputial tissues up to the level of the external preputial ori ce in the standing animal. While transient mild postoperative complications at the amputation and perineal urethrostomy site are not infrequent, severe intra- and postoperative complications are rare. Owner acceptance and satisfaction with thecombined Callicrate Bander phallectomy and perineal urethrostomy procedure is high, but owners must be aware that urine staining of the hind legs and perineum is a frequent consequence of the perineal urethrostomy that may require daily cleaning to prevent urine scalding. \u00a92022 The Authors.

However, studies regarding the levels of POPs in horses are limited. Objectives To study the concentration of organochlorine pesticides(OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organophosphate pesticides (OPs) in hair samples collected from 52 sport horses in Turkey; and to investigate the possible relationship among current exposure situation, age, and sex of horses. Study design Original article. Methods Hair samples were collected from 52 sport horses, which weredivided into three groups according to age: Group 1, <5 years ( n=17); Group 2, 5 -10 years ( n=16); and Group 3, >10 years ( n=19). In addition to age, the samples were also analysed by location and sex. Thirty environmental pollutants (2 OPs, 7 OCPs, 15 PCBs and 6 PAHs) were analysed using a sensitive GC-MS method. Results All samples contained a minimum of one pollutant, and 23 of the 30 measured pollutants were identi ed in at least one sample. The number of positive samples and concentrationsof POPs were higher in Group 2 and Group 3 than in Group 1 (p<0.05). Females and males presented similar results. Interms of location, concentrations of almost all chemicalswere higher in Sanliurfa than in Ankara ( p<0.05). Main limitations Feed, drinking water, and the other related environmental samples were not analysed to evaluate the relationship between those sources and POP levels in hair samples collected from sport horses. Conclusions The concentration of POPs in the hair and other tissues ofsport horses should be monitored periodically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst report to investigate levels of the POPs in hair samples from sport horses in Turkey. Clinical relevance The presence of POPs in animals could be a causative factor in a variety of diseases, including cancer, metabolic disorders, immune suppression, growth failures, cardiovascular diseases and congenital abnormalities, even at very low concentrations. In the present study, the levels of POPs in horsehairwere generally higher than previous studies conducted in humans and other animals. These ndings may indicate the extent of environmental contaminationand the importance of POPs as an external factor responsible for health problems in sport horses. In future, determining any relationships between thelevels of POPs in biological fluids and race performance of sport horses could be worthwhile. \u00a92022 EVJ Ltd642 formulas are only available from your licensed equine veterinarian or direct from Platinum Performance\u00ae.Complete Joint Support To Maintain Soundness & Longevity Platinum Performance\u00ae CJ The Only Formula of Its Kind As the most comprehensive combination of joint supporting ingredients available, Platinum Performance\u00ae CJ contains omega-3 Boswellia serrata and mo re to help maintain soundness.

Young, Inc, East Summary Background Herbal supplements containing curcumin and other ingredients are used for pain management in horses with osteoarthritis (OA). Objectives To test the effects of a herbal supplement containingcurcumin and other ingredients in horses with lameness due to naturally occurring OA. Study design Two-period randomised crossover design. Methods Ten Thoroughbreds with naturally occurring chronic OA wererandomly assigned to the treatment (BLP; Buteless /C226 Performance) or control (CTR, no supplement) groups andfed daily for 30 days. On Days -1 (before treatment), 15 and 30, lameness examination, range of motion, pain on palpation and force platform data were collected. Plasma curcumin concentration and its metabolites were measured on Days 1 and 14. Gastroscopy, a complete blood count (CBC) and a serum biochemistry panel were performed on each horse before treatment on Day -1 and Day 31. Gastric lesions (ulcers) were scored in real time by a masked investigator. Results Mean peak vertical force (PVF), measured by the forceplatform, signi cantly increased in the lame limb of the BLP- treated horses on Days 15 (0.40 /C60.13 N/Kg, p=0.0025) 30 (0.63 /C60.14 N/Kg, p<0.0001) the CTR group. In addition, the mean normalised PVF was higher in the BLP group on Day 15 ( p=0.0438) and on Day 30(p=0.0003) when compared to CTR horses for the same days. The PVF signi cantly improved ( 5%; range, 5.2% to 33%) 9 individual BLP-treated horses and did notimprove ( <5%; range, 0 to 3.4%) in 3 of BLP-treated horses. Also, PVF improved ( 5%; range, 7.6% to 15.4%) in 3 of 9 horses in the CRT group. Squamous gastric lesion scores signi cantly decreased in both groups by Day 31. Plasma curcumin-O-sulfate concentrations (1.2 to 3.3 ng/ml) werepresent in 9 of 10 BLP-treated horses by Day 14. Main limitations Small sample size and the absence of a positive treatment (NSAID) control. Conclusion The BLP supplement containing curcumin achieved plasmaconcentrations and improved weightbearing in some treated horses with naturally occurring OA. Clinical relevance A supplement containing curcumin and other ingredients fed daily for 30 days improved weightbearing in some of the horses with osteoarthritis by Days 15 and 30 of administration. Curcumin or other ingredients within the supplementdid not cause or worsen nonglandular gastric ulcers. Curcumin and its metabolite (curcumin-O-sulfate,desmethoxycurcumin) were not present in plasma 2 hours after feeding on Day 1; however, plasma concentrations were found in 9/10 horses after feeding the supplement on Day 14. \u00a92022 equine anaesthesia C. Dagnall,*, L. Khenissiand E. Love Faculty of Health Sciences, The University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; andLangford Vets, The anaesthetist aims to preserve normal physiology of the horse notwithstanding the use of general anaesthetic drugs and pre-existing pathological changes. Provision of analgesia and maintaining an adequate plane of anaesthesia are important alongside monitoring cardiorespiratory performance, response to noxious stimuli and temperature. There are a variety of techniques that subjectively or objectively assess physiological variables, and the results should be interpreted in the context of the anaesthetic protocol. Basic 'hands-on 'monitoring of anaesthesia requires no equipment and is a core skill for every anaesthetist.However, as technology advances, many more electronic monitoring options have become available. This reviewdescribes how to use speci c monitoring techniques, discusses the evidence underpinning them and evaluatestheir place in clinical practice. Where appropriate, normal and abnormal values are highlighted, although evaluation of trends may be more important in some cases. Regular documentation of variables enables trends to be identi ed and is key to appropriate early intervention. All basicmonitoring techniques that require no equipment, such as ocular and mucous membrane assessment and pulse palpation, are recommended for every general anaesthetic procedure. The use of capnography, pulse oximetry, electrocardiography and blood pressure monitoring devices is recommended where indicated (Martinez et al., 2008), recognising that anaesthesia in horses is performed in a variety of places with different facilities and using various drug combinations. Introduction The anaesthetist aims to preserve normal physiology of the horse notwithstanding the use of general anaesthetic drugs and pathological changes. An adequate plane of anaesthesia and appropriate analgesia are important to facilitate the procedure being performed. Continuous patient assessment must be carried out to achieve this, with documentation of parameters at least every 5 minutes. A knowledge of what parameters to monitor and how tomonitor them is essential, along with rapid interpretation. Anaesthetic mortality in horses is relatively high with rates up to 1.9% (Johnston et al., 2002; Bidwell et al., 2007; Senior et al., 2007; Jago et al., 2015; Dugdale and Taylor, 2016; Nicolaisen al., 2022). The Con dential Enquiry into Perioperative Equine Fatalities 4 (CEPEF 4) has recently beenlaunched and, in due course, will provide data relating to current anaesthetic practices in horses (Gozalo-Marcilla et al., 2020). It is timely to revisit and discuss anaesthetic monitoring because of perceived high mortality rates.Plane of anaesthesia The concepts of stages and planes of anaesthesia originate from Guedel 's classi cation, which whenadministering ether (Guedel, 1927). Anaesthetic practice has since advanced dramatically, yet reference to the plane of anaesthesia remains relevant during patient monitoring. Maintaining an adequate plane of general anaesthesia in horses is essential for safety and welfare reasons. This is primarily achieved through 'hands-on 'clinical evaluation of the animal although objective measurement usingelectroencephalography (EEG) and bispectral index (BIS) has been investigated (see 'Electroencephalography '). The adverse effects of awareness are well documented inhumans (Kotsovolis & Komninos, 2009) though conversely, relative overdoses of anaesthetic agent are also undesirable and can signi cantly compromise cardiovascular and respiratory function as well as contributing to anaestheticrelated morbidity and mortality. Reflexes and patient characteristics Observation of ocular movements and re flexes are monitored in most equine anaesthetic procedures (Hubbell et al., 2010).Observation is quick and easy except when surgical access to the head is required. The palpebral re flex is triggered by stroking the cilia although if performed repeatedly this re flex will fatigue. The corneal re flex is elicited by corneal pressure though may risk corneal damage so routine evaluation is notrecommended. Commonly used drugs in fluence the consistency of ocular observations that indicate the plane of anaesthesia (Taylor & Clarke, 2007a; Trim, 1998). Ketamine produces spontaneous blinking, a brisk palpebral re flex and some nystagmus with a variable eye position (Trim, 1998). In contrast, nystagmusduring anaesthesia with volatile agents is indicative of insuf cient anaesthetic plane and ocular re flexes become slower as the plane of anaesthesia deepens (Taylor & Clarke,2007b). Absence of a corneal re flex and/or a central dry eye with any drug protocol should raise concern of overdose ofanaesthetic agent (Hubbell & Muir, 2009; Taylor & Clarke, 2007b). Most anaesthetic and sedative agents reduce tear production (Brightman et al., 1983; Leonardi et al., 2020), and administration of arti cial ocular lubrication will assist with corneal protection. Other indicators of anaesthetic plane include the anal reflex. A reduction in anal contraction on stimulation is associated with increasing anaesthetic plane (Hubbell & Muir, 2009). Shivering and increased muscle tension (particularlynoticeable in the neck and legs if the horse is in dorsal \u00a92021 often useful indicators of an inadequate plane of anaesthesia for surgical stimulus, although impending conscious or unconscious movement remains challenging to predict. Monitoring re flexes and patient characteristics using a 'hand-on 'approach is a crucial and fundamental skill for the equine anaesthetist in both 'eld' and hospital settings. Cardiovascular performance and oxygenation Adequate tissue perfusion is important for ensuring oxygen delivery to the tissues. The driving force for tissue perfusion is the mean arterial pressure (MAP), which is a product ofcardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance. Cardiac output can be de ned as the product of stroke volume (SV) and heart rate (HR), and the SV depends upon the afterload,preload and cardiac contractility. Objective measurements of perfusion of tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract and muscle are possible with spectrophotometry (Reichert et al., 2014), surface oximetry (Snyder et al., 1994) and LASER Doppler flowmetry (Edner et al., 2005). However, their use is currently limited to research work and further work is requiredto establish their clinical utility in practice. Maintaining delivery of oxygen to tissues is critical for aerobic respiration and long-term tissue survival. Fig 1 demonstrates the dependence of oxygen delivery on bothcardiovascular function and oxygen transfer, the latter of which also depends on ventilation (see 'Ventilation '). Oxygen delivery (DO 2) is calculated by: DO 2\u00bcCaO 2/C2CO : Where CaO 2=arterial blood oxygen content. CaO 2is the amount of oxygen carried per 100 ml of arterial blood, representing the sum of the oxygen bound to haemoglobin and dissolved in blood. Compromised cardiopulmonary function during anaesthesia caused by hypoventilation, ventilation-perfusion al., 1968; Nyman & Hedenstierna, 1989). Hypoxaemia is de ned as an arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2)<8.0 kPa (60 mmHg), values <10.7 kPa considered suboptimal (Pascoe et al., 1983). Hypoxaemia is challenging to equine general anaesthesia (Auckburally & Nyman, 2017; Nyman et al., 2012; Trim & Wan, 1990), although the resultant negative effects are unclear (Trim & Wan, 1990). Haemoglobin saturation in arterial blood (SaO 2) depends on the PaO 2, as illustrated by the oxy-haemoglobin dissociation curve. This curve is shifted to the left for horsescompared to humans, meaning equine haemoglobin is 50% saturated at a PaO 2of approximately 3.3 kPa (25 mmHg) whereas human haemoglobin requires a PaO 2of 3.6 kPa (27 mmHg) for 50% haemoglobin saturation (Cambier et al., 2005; Clerbaux et al., 1986). The clinical relevance of this 0.3 kPa (2 mmHg) difference is unclear. The most common cause of fatality associated with anaesthesia in noncolic cases is reported as cardiovascular collapse, followed by fractures (Johnston et al., 2002). Poor perfusion resulting from nonfatal cardiovascular compromise is linked to the development of myopathy (Grandy et al., 1987) which contributes to weakness in recovery. This may increase the likelihood of fractures. Thorough evaluation of the cardiovascular system during anaesthesia is essential to reduce associated morbidity and mortality. Basic cardiovascular monitoring Mucous membranes can be evaluated to subjectively assess tissue perfusion. Both sluggish capillary re ll times (over 2 s) and pale pink or greyish colouration (sometimes seen withhalothane) may indicate poor perfusion from either reduced CO or vasoconstriction which is common after alpha-2 agonist administration (Taylor & Clarke, 2007b).

This is occasionally seen with hypercapnia but, more commonly, in cases of septic shock. Congested mucous membranes can also be appreciated with over- zealous dobutamine administration resulting in increased cardiac output and possible vasodilation. Visual evaluation of mucous membrane colour is a poor indicator of haemoglobin desaturation, with observers failing to identify cyanosis in humans with saturations of <75% (Medd et al., 1959). Anaemia further impedes visual assessment. Mucousmembrane colour should not be relied upon for assessment of oxygenation status and rather, used as a prompt for further investigation. Objective measurements of oxygenation status (e.g. pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis) will yield more accurate results and help guide anaesthetic management. The pulse rate can be measured by peripheral pulse palpation, and although this can identify irregularities in rhythm, additional objective monitoring (e.g. electrocardiogram [ECG]) is recommended. The normal HR for anaesthetised horses is 30 -45 beats/min, but 35-60 beats/ min should be expected in anaesthetised foals (Hubbell &Muir, 2009), as their resting heart rate is 100 beats/min at birth (Robertson, 2005). Pulse quality can provide an indication of pulse pressure, which represents the difference between systolic (SAP) and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP). However, there is no evidence to suggest whether palpation of peripheral pulses provides an accurate assessment of pulse pressure in horses. Pulse pressure is further discussed in'Invasive Blood Pressure Measurement '. Objective measurement of blood pressure alongside integration withother parameters such as HR is recommended if there is concern about abnormal pulse quality or for prolonged general anaesthesia. Pulse oximetry The pulse oximeter provides continuous estimation of theSaO 2(SpO 2). Values of 93% approximate to a PaO 2=8.0 kPa (60 mmHg) in horses (Cambier et al., 2005; Smale et al.,1994), so the anaesthetist should strive for SpO 2values equal to or above this. Pulse oximetry also indicates the presence ofpulsatile flow to tissues and displays the pulse rate. Devices also have the advantage of providing a continuous audibleoutput which is often accompanied by a pitch change, warning of decreasing SpO 2. The device is noninvasive, and its portable nature makes it useful for eld anaesthesia. Patient contact is made with a cutaneous or muco-cutaneous probe/clip often placed on the tongue or lip. There are a variety of clips ( Fig 2 ) with the larger sizes more suitable for equine use. There is no consistently reportedsuperior location (Chaf n et al., 1996; Gigu `ere et 2014). Oxy-haemoglobin and deoxy-haemoglobin are differentially detected using infra-red and near infra-red radiation (wavelengths 660 nm and 940 nm respectively). Radiation is emitted from two light emitting diodes embedded within the probe and either transmitted through or re flected off tissues to a photodiode detector. The infra-red radiation is predominantly absorbed by oxy-haemoglobinand near infra-red by deoxy-haemoglobin. The ratio of infra- red and near infra-red absorption is used to calculate the SpO 2based on an experimental calibration curve, where SaO 2was measured in healthy human volunteers (Kelleher, 1989).The gold standard of arterial oxygenation measurement is ABG analysis, but the bene t of continuous monitoring with pulse oximetry should not be underestimated. However, thedevice also has limitations. Devices are reliable for tracking changes in equine SaO 2but tend towards inaccuracy as SaO 2drops below 90% (Chaf n et al., 1996; Koenig et al., 2003; Martinez et al., 1999; Matthews et al., 1994; Zoff et al., 2019). They also depend on pulsatile flow in the arteries, so any disruption in perfusion or venous pulsations will limitdevice accuracy. Other molecules absorbing near infra-red or infra-red wavelengths also cause spurious SpO 2readings. For example, methaemoglobin absorbs red and infra-redradiation equally well, resulting in an SpO 285% (Chan et al., 2013). Although pulse oximetry can detect hypoxaemia,there is a time delay between this and the initiation of hypoxic event. Oxygen analysers may be able to warn of this risk prior to patient insult if an inadequate fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) is administered. This is because they sample the inspired gas from the breathing circuit (see 'Fraction of Inspired Oxygen Analysers '). The electrocardiogram The depolarisation and repolarisation of a large mass of cardiac myocytes that occurs during the spread of electrical impulses through the cardiac muscle can be detected and ampli ed at the surface of the skin. A minimum of three electrode contact points with crocodile clips or adhesive gelelectrodes can be con gured in a 'base-apex orientation 'if access to the left and right of the horse is possible (Fig 3a ) (Mitchell, 2019), although any orientation of pairs of electrodes will produce a waveform if they span the heart (Taylor & Clarke, 2007b). Electrode contact can be enhanced using isopropyl alcohol or additional gel depending on electrode type to improve trace quality. The potential difference is measured between paired electrodes referred to as 'leads '(Fig 3b ). Waves of depolarisation that travel towards the positive electrode result in an upwarddeflection and waves that travel away result in a downward deflection on the ECG trace producing the characteristic waveform shown in Fig 3c (Mitchell, 2019). The normal electrical path of the wave of depolarisation begins at thesinus node, spreading through the atria then the atrioventricular node. From here, the wave is directed via the Bundle of His and then throughout the ventricular myocardium via Purkinji bres. Additional waveforms that may or may not be present in the equine ECG include the T a waveform which is a de flection after the P wave representing atrial repolarisation and the U wave which follows the T wave. The source of the U wave may represent Purkinji bre repolarisation ( Fig 3c ). Heart rate variability describes the variable duration of the R intervals of the ECG governed by the autonomicnervous system. It represents an emerging eld of equine monitoring which may assist in postoperative prognosticassessment (McConachie et al., 2016). Noninvasive blood pressure The minimum acceptable value for blood pressure duringequine anaesthesia is controversial. Deleterious effects of maintaining MAP >60 mmHg have not been demonstrated (Duke et al., 2006; Franci et al., 2006) yet maintaining \u00a92021 EVJ EDUCATION may be in avoiding or reducing the severity of postanaesthetic myopathy which may be caused by reduced tissue perfusion (Duke et al., 2006; Peek, 1993). Noninvasive blood pressure measurement (NIBP) can be performed using oscillometry. An in flatable cuff that is one fth of the tail circumference is placed over the middle coccygeal artery in adult horses and foals (Gent et al., 2015; Gigu `ere et et al., 2002; Tearney et al., 2016). Cuff placement over the dorsalmetatarsal artery is also acceptable in anaesthetised foals when using the Cardell Veterinary Monitor 9402 (CAS Medical Systems) and Dinamap Pro 100 (GE Medical Systems) (Gigu `ere et al., 2005). The cuff in flates until arterial flow is occluded and then gradually de flated until arterial flow resumes, giving the SAP (Haskins, 2015). MAP corresponds to the maximum of the pulsations and DAP when the pulsations decrease (Haskins, 2015). Detection of pulsations is via a pressure sensor within the cuff. An alternative pulsation detection method is a Doppler probe placed distal to the cuff over the artery.NIBP devices have been compared to invasive blood pressure (IBP) monitoring which is considered the goldstandard for monitoring blood pressure. There is much variability in NIBP device performance which could result in inappropriate management of hypotension (Branson, 1997; Hatz et al., 2015; Rousseau-Blass et al., 2020). Their reliability is questionable in hyper- and hypotensive states in adult anaesthetised horses (T \u00a8unsmeyer et al., 2015). NIBP lacks beat-to-beat monitoring but provides a noninvasive option oftrend assessment (Heliczer et al., 2016). Inappropriately large or small cuffs can cause incorrect systematically low or high readings, respectively, (Latshaw et al., 1979) and the differing cuff sizes used in various studies complicate the interpretation of results (Gent et al., 2015; Tearney et al., 2016). Invasive blood pressure Arterial catheterisation is required for IBP measurement. Strict asepsis should be practised for catheter placement and the transducer set-up to avoid infection, as consequences can be catastrophic (Barr et al., 2005).

Furthermore, ampli cation of the pulse wave occurs towards the periphery causes overestimation of the systolic pressures (Gent et al.,2015; Muir et al., 1983). The catheter is connected to a column of pressurised fluid and a transducer. Most pressure transducers comprise of one or two diaphragms that areexposed to pressure changes within the fluid column because of arterial pulsations. A 'fast flush' lever or pull system is usually located near the pressure transducer (Fig 4a ). Strain gauges transduce this pressure change into an electrical signal which is digital depiction of an arterialpressure wave ( Fig 4b ) (Walton & Wilson, 2017). Prior to use, equipment should be inspected for damage (Chevallier &Oostrom, 2020), the transducer placed at the level of the right atrium (Trim, 1998) and the system zeroed to atmospheric pressure. The arterial waveform represents vascular distension in response to the ejection of the SV and therefore depends on the artery cannulated. Peripheral artery waveforms have an increased gradient on the systolic upstroke, a delayed or absent dichrotic notch and a more obvious, lower diastolic wave than their central counterpart (O 'Rourke & Yaginuma, 1984). The dichrotic notch represents wave re flection from the closure of the aortic valve. Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic pressure and depends uponSV and arterial compliance. It may give an indication of CO (Hubbell & Muir, 2009). Narrow pulse pressure can be a result of reduced SV or vasoconstriction. A reduced SV may manifest as hypotension and require intervention; however, vasoconstriction secondary to alpha-2 agonist administration may not and hypertension is common. Wide pulse pressure palpated as hyperdynamic pulses can indicate increased CO and vasodilatation, which is sometimes present in the early stages of septic shock. Hyperdynamic pulses may also be appreciated after dobutamine administration. The pressurised fluid column used for IBP measurement will oscillate independent of any external energy input. The rate of the oscillations is described as the natural frequency. If the frequency of arterial blood flow oscillations approaches the fluid column 's natural frequency, the waves summate in a phenomenon called resonance. To assess the degree of resonance within the system, a square wave test can be employed ( Fig 4c ). Damping is introduced to reduce resonance (Walton & Wilson, 2017). Under-damping results inan erroneously high SAP and jagged waveform ( Fig 4d ) and can be recti ed by changing tubing so it has a slightly wider bore or more compliance to increase damping (Moxham, 2003). Over-damping results in erroneously low SAP, high DAP and a flattened waveform ( Fig 4e ). It can be caused by air bubbles, blood clots, narrow catheters or compliant tubing(Moxham, 2003).

Urine production Urinary catheters are placed during most equine anaestheticsin a theatre setting to minimise urine contamination in the operating theatre. They also enable monitoring of urine production and avoid excessive urination in the recovery box resulting in a wet, slippery floor. Alpha-2 agonists are commonly used as part of general anaesthetic protocols andincrease urine production in horses (Gasthuys et al., 1996; Nu nez et al., 2004; Watson et al., 2002). This can manifest as a reduced circulating volume and should be considered when troubleshooting causes of hypotension. Ventilation Spontaneous ventilation is possible during equineanaesthesia, but recumbency and most anaesthetic drugs induce hypoventilation (Benson et al., 1982; Day et al., 1995; Sorenson & Robinson, 1980). Hypoventilation is de ned as ventilation which is unable to match the metabolic rate ofthe body and is characterised by a rising partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) (McDonell & Kerr, 2015). Normal PaCO 2values for awake horses are 4.7 -6 kPa (35 - 45 mmHg), and values greater than this are referred to as hypercapnia. Anaesthetised horses often have PaCO 2values up to 8 kPa (60 mmHg) as a result of reduced minuteventilation, which can be due to either reduced TV, respiratory rate or both (McDonell & Kerr, 2015). A TV of 14 - 18 ml/kg in adult horses and 12-14 ml/kg in foals is recommended during mechanical ventilation (Hubbell, 2010). Along with the function of the cardiovascular system, ventilation plays a critical role in tissue oxygen delivery ( Fig 1 ) (see 'Cardiovascular Performance and Oxygenation '). Basic monitoring of ventilation Contrary to most mammals, adult horses have active and passive components to both inspiratory and expiratory phases (Koterba et al., 1985). Contraction of respiratory muscles assists the end of expiration and beginning of inspiration (Koterba et al., 1985), and these active phases of ventilation can become more pronounced during light planes of anaesthesia. They can also be observed as spontaneous ventilation attempts during mechanical ventilation if the plane of anaesthesia is light. In dorsal recumbency, upwards abdominal movements can be seen during inhalation, corresponding to the caudal movement of the dependent diaphragm (Mosing et al., 2017) andoutwards chest wall movement. Similar diaphragmatic and thoracic excursions occur in lateral recumbency (Benson et al., 1982). It is not possible to estimate tidal volumes from visual assessment of thoracic excursion, but life-threatening patterns such as agonal breathing or marked airway obstruction can be identi ed along with patient -ventilator asynchrony. Counting respiratory rate from thoracic andabdominal movements, subjectively assessing effort and depth of ventilation by observing the patient and ventilator bellows or reservoir bag movements are examples of basic ventilation monitoring. Capnography and spirometry canprovide an objective guide as to when to instigate and howto deliver mechanical ventilation. Capnography and capnometry Capnometry is the measurement of end tidal CO 2partial pressure (EtCO 2) from the gases in the breathing circuit sampled close to the patient ( Fig 5 ), and capnography produces a continuous waveform of CO 2partial pressure (Fig 6 ). Measurement of EtCO 2is useful when it provides a close estimation of PaCO 2because it allows continuous monitoring. Hypercapnia produces detrimental andseemingly desirable effects, most of which are secondary tosympathetic stimulation ( Table 1 ). It is these desirable effects that lead some authors to suggest moderate levels ofhypercapnia can be tolerated (Hubbell & Muir, 2009; Moens, 2013). Capnography can provide evidence that the circulatory system is capable of CO 2transport as a fall in CO results in a reduced EtCO 2when ventilation is constant. Capnography is also useful for con rming endotracheal intubation, identi es gas leakages and reveals abnormal patterns(Fig 6 ). Marked differences between alveolar and arterial CO 2 partial pressures (A-a PCO 2) have been demonstrated during anaesthesia in horses, in fluenced by anaesthetic protocol, patient health status, bodyweight, ventilation strategy and recumbency (Geiser & Rohrbach, 1992; Koenig 1989; Neto et Rainger et al., PCO 2is of 2analysis alongside continuous EtCO 2trend analysis represents a sensible Fig 5: Gas sampling port at the 'Y'piece in the equine breathing circuit. \u00a92021 EVJ 57 22/11/22 5:33 PMmonitoring strategy (see 'Blood al., 1997; Cribb, & Rohrbach, 1992; et al., 2000). The optimal frequency of PaCO 2 analysis has not been established because it is unclear if theA-a PCO 2is in fluenced by the duration of to measure EtCO 2in clinical practice. Most capnography monitors used for equine anaesthesia are side stream, as they sample gasfrom the breathing circuit close to the patient and analyse the sample distant from the patient. Mainstream capnographs analyse CO 2concentrations directly within the breathing circuit. They are not usually suitable for equineanaesthesia as most connections are not compatible with the large diameter equine endotracheal tubes (Bednarski & Muir, 2009). Owing to the time taken for sampling and analysis, there is a slight delay in the EtCO 2readings with side stream capnographs compared to the ventilation phase ofthe patient.Additional expiratory gas analysis Alveolar concentration of volatile agents When general anaesthesia is maintained with volatileanaesthetics, measurement of the alveolar concentration of the volatile agent may assist in approximating anaesthetic plane, reducing the likelihood of inadvertent patient movement (Parviainen & Trim, 2000). In rebreathing systems, the vaporiser setting can be different to the volatile concentration within the breathing circuit (Trim, 1998) making gas analysers useful. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is de ned as the minimum value of the end tidal volatile agent percentage that prevents movement in response to a nociceptive stimulus in 50% of patients (Merkel & Eger, 1963). The end tidal volatile agent percentage is assumed to be in equilibrium with the volatile concentration at the brain, which is their target site. This enables a quantitative measure of the plane of anaesthesia achieved with volatile agents compared to that described by Guedel (1927). MAC values PCO2 (mmHg)a) (s) Time (s)ABCD E waveforms; b-c beginning of expiration, C-D expiratory plateau, D point of end tidal carbon dioxide measurement, D-E inspiration; (b) expiratory obstruction; (c) rebreathing gases; (f) hypoventilation; (g) ventilation during \u00a92021 EDUCATION 58 22/11/22 5:33 PMfor volatile anaesthetics in adult horses are shown in Table 2 although variable concentrations may be required depending on: adjunctive drugs administered; age; physiological state of the patient (Brosnan, 2013); and atmospheric pressure. Foals generally have a reduced MAC compared to adult horses, although there is limited literature demonstrating this. For example, the MAC for iso flurane in foals is approximately 0.84% (Dunlop et al., 1989), whereas inadult horses it is approximately 1.3% (Steffey et al., 1977) (Table 2 ). It should be noted that market authorisations for use of volatile agents vary depending on country. Most modern anaesthetic monitors quantify volatile anaesthetic agent concentration from gas samples from thebreathing circuit ( Fig 5 ) and analyse them using infra-red absorption spectroscopy. Molecules absorb radiation atvarying wavelengths, allowing differentiation between various volatile anaesthetic agents. The absorbance peaks of different anaesthetic agents vary between 3 and 13 \u00b5m, but there is overlap within this range (Anaesthesia GasMonitoring: Evolution of a de facto Standard of Care, 2009; Seavell, 2005). The light absorption is proportional to the gas concentration, obeying the Beer -Lambert Law: A\u00bclC: Where A =absorption, =molar extraction coef cient, l = optical path length and C =concentration.Methane absorbs light at 3.3 \u00b5m and is excreted via the lungs in horses (Sasaki et al., 1999). Infra-red analysers, such as the Datex Capnomac Ultima (Datex Instrumentarium Corp.), that utilise the lower end of the absorption spectra for volatile agents are subject to interference from methane (Dujardin et al., 2005; Moens et al., 1991; Turner et al., 2008). This renders their output value for end tidal volatile concentration erroneously increased for halothane and decreased for isoflurane and sevo flurane (Dujardin et al., 2005; al., 2008). Photoacoustic 1025 utilise pulsed wavelengths of 10.3 -13\u00b5m and can circumvent this problem (Dujardin et al., 2005; Walder et al., 1993). Fraction of inspired oxygen analysers Hypoxaemia in anaesthetised horses can occur despite using 100% oxygen as a carrier gas (Hall et al., 1968). Lowering the FiO 2is not recommended as it may not reduce absorption atelectasis during anaesthesia in mechanically ventilated horses (Taylor & Seymour, 2016) and reduces muscle oxygenation (Portier et al., 2009). Absorption atelectasis is the collapse of alveoli secondary to rapid diffusion of oxygen into the pulmonary capillaries, leaving no gas remaining within the alveoli to assist in keeping them in flated. Monitoring FiO 2 allows con rmation the percentage of oxygen in the breathing circuit ( Fig 7 ) and is performed by analysing gas samples close to the endotracheal tube ( Fig 5 ). Low FiO 2 values can result from low flow rates (e.g. if there is inadequate de-nitrogenation of breathing circuits, or leakingequipment) or dysfunction of gas delivery (Otteni, 1993). Oxygen analysers can alert the anaesthetist to low oxygen percentages in the breathing circuit, yielding the potential to avoid hypoxaemic insult. Modern gas oxygen analysers utilise the paramagnetic properties of oxygen. An electromagnetic eld generates a pressure difference between the sample gas and a reference gas, depending on the sample gasoxygen concentration (Langton & Hutton, 2009). This is detected by a transducer and converted into an electrical signal. Analysers must contain a water trap as water vapour can cause erroneous readings (Garg & Gupta, 2013). Fuel cells can also be used and are like the Clark electrode (See 'Blood Gas Analysis '), except the reaction of oxygen with the lead anode generates the electrical current (Garg & Gupta,2013). Fuel cells should be replaced regularly as the lead is oxidised but are not vulnerable to water vapour interference. Temperature In humans, hypothermia increases surgical site infections, intraoperative blood loss (Xu et al., 2020) and cardiac complications (Frank et al., 1997) and impairs immunological function (Qadan et al., 2009). Adverse effects of hypothermia in horses are unclear, although it may prolong recovery times and increase the number of attempts to stand (Mayerhofer et al., 2005; Voulgaris & Hofmeister, 2009). It is logical to maintain normothermia (36.5 -38\u00b0C) to preserve normal physiological function (Hubbell & Muir, 2009). Factorscontributing to hypothermia during anaesthesia include environmental conditions, duration of anaesthesia, wetting of the patient (e.g. surgical preparation, profuse sweating) and contact with cold surfaces (Mayerhofer et al., 2005; Tomasic, 1999). Direct measurement of core body temperature by cannulation of the pulmonary artery is reserved for clinicalTABLE 1: Advantages and disadvantages of hypercapnia during general anaesthesia in horses Disadvantages Advantages Summative effect on decreasing pH if metabolic acidaemia is present (Moens,2013).Maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressure duringanaesthesia (Brosnan et al.,2003). The reduced minute volume that results in hypercapnia may impair the uptake of volatile agent, risking patientmovement (Trim, 1998).Increase in cardiac index and blood pressure (PaCO 2> 7.3 kPa (55 mmhg)) (Khannaet al., 1995).

Estimation of core temperature can be achieved by measuring rectal temperatures (Tomasic & Nann, 1999). Equine oesophageal temperature probes are commercially available (Vetronic Services Ltd.), but their accuracy is unknown. Neuromuscular blockade Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) confer musclerelaxation secondary to paralysis. It is not possible to monitor reflex activity (e.g. palpebral re flex) or muscle tone during neuromuscular blockade, making the assessment of plane ofanaesthesia challenging. Sympathetic stimulation seen as an increase in HR or blood pressure could provide a nonspeci c indication of nociception and/or inadequate anaestheticplane. Ensuring adequate hypnosis and analgesia before andduring the use of NMBA use is essential for welfare. The use of nondepolarising agents (such as rocuronium or cis-atacurium) in horses has been described in ophthalmological surgery to achieve a central eye position and to facilitate orthopaedic procedures (Auer & Moens, 2011; Tutunaru et al., 2019). Monitoring the degree of neuromuscular block should always be performed to avoid residual neuromuscular block on recovery and to assist in decision making regarding the use of reversal agents (Bechara et al., 1999). Assessing the corresponding muscular response to stimulation of a motor nerve provides information on thedegree of neuromuscular blockade. This is because communication between the motor neuron and muscle end plate is blocked by NMBAs binding to motor end-plate acetylcholine receptors. The motor nerve selected depends on available access, but the super cial peroneal or radial nerve represent sensible choices (Martin-Flores, 2013; Mosinget al., 2010; Taylor & Clarke, 2007b; Tutunaru et al., 2019). The facial nerve may be a suboptimal choice due to the relative insensitivity of the corresponding muscles to NMBAs (Mosing et al., 2010). Positive and negative electrodes are connected directly over the nerve to be stimulated (Mosing et al., 2010). Correct placement should be veri ed prior to administration of NMBAs by observation of correct muscle activity inresponse to an electrical stimulus. Super cial peroneal nerve stimulation elicits pelvic limb digit extension, and radial nervestimulation fore-limb digit extension. There are a variety of nerve stimulation patterns that can be used (Martin-Flores, 2013), but a sequence of four supramaximal stimulating currents over 2 s is the most common and referred to as a 'train of four '(TOF). In the absence of paralysis, it elicits four sequential muscle twitches.Other stimulation patterns include a double-burst, single twitch and tetanic stimulation (Martin-Flores, 2013). Acceleromyography is the best described method for quanti cation of twitch activity and facilitates accurate assessment of the presence of residual neuromuscularblockade (Marly et al., 2013; Martin-Flores et al., 2008). An accelerometer is xed to the hoof and the magnitude of the rst twitch is compared to the fourth and a 'TOF ratio ' Fig 7: Anaesthetic monitor displaying electrocardiography, invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry and capnography traces. Heart rates are shown for both the electrocardiography and arterial blood pressure traces. The gas analyser display shows oxygen, nitrogenoxide and sevo flurane analysis. Noninvasive blood pressure and dual site temperature monitoring is also possible, but not performed in this example. ET, end tidal; FI, fraction inspired; HR, heart rate; 22/11/22 5:33 PMcalculated. Incomplete nondepolarising neuromuscular blockade exhibits a fade phenomenon, shown as decreasing twitch magnitudes in the TOF. This is observed during the onset and offset of the neuromuscular blockade. Complete neuromuscular blockade is characterised by no twitch activity, whilst the absence of neuromuscular blockade is characterised by a TOF ratio >0.9 (Martin-Flores, 2013; McGrath & Hunter, 2006). In horses, the ocular muscles aremore sensitive to NMBA action than skeletal muscle, with the onset of a central globe occurring before a loss of TOF and persisting beyond the absence of skeletal muscle blockade (Auer & Moens, 2011). Advanced methods of monitoring Blood gas analysis Patient-side, portable devices for ABG analysis facilitate rapid, direct, intermittent measurements of PaCO 2and PaO 2 and calculated values for SaO 2. Acid -base balance, electrolytes, lactate, urea and creatinine may also the 'point-of-care 'testing during anaesthesia (Langdon, 2018). Arterial sampling is an invasiveprocedure, and aseptic technique should be used. Dissolved oxygen is measured using a Clarke electrode by amperometry, as described by Langton and Hutton (2009). Samples drawn into plastic syringes should be analysed within 10 min to ensure accuracy (Picandet et al., 2007). Continuous intra-arterial monitoring of patient oxygenation may become available for clinical use in equine patients. The technology is already available for humans and utilises miniature intra-arterial sensors (Ganter & Zollinger, 2003). PaCO using a Severinghaus electrode, utilising the acidic property of dissolved CO 2. Only CO 2diffuses from the blood over a Teflon membrane into a bicarbonate buffer solution, which bathes an electrode that detects changes in pH (Langton & Hutton, 2009). The relationship between pH and PaCO 2is linear between 1.2 and 12.0 kPa (9 -90 mmHg) (Langton & Hutton, 2009), meaning ventilation should be considered when derangement in pH is present. However, mixed acid - base abnormalities may be present, so anion gap,bicarbonate and base excess should be carefully evaluated. Further detail on the use of acid -base analysis alongside ABG analysis is described by Alonso (2018). Various patient-side analysers EPOC II Medical Inc.])have been evaluated for the measurement of equine PaO 2, pH and P aCO 2in a clinical setting but they should not be used interchangeably (Bardell et al., 2016; Klein et al., 1999; Peir \u00b4o et al., 2010). More recently, reference intervals for equine arterial blood gas, acid -base and electrolyte analysis have also been determined using the ABL 77 series (Radiometer Medical) (Hughes & Bardell, 2019). Evaluating ABG and pH is recommended in cases where hypoxaemia and/or hypercapnia is suspected or likely tooccur. However, it is not usually necessary in healthy, routine cases and is not usually performed in the eld. Cardiac output Monitoring CO during equine anaesthesia is mainly reservedfor research (Kutter et al., 2016). Despite this, CO measurement may enable guided fluid resuscitation andchoice of cardiac support drugs during general anaesthesia(Corley et al., 2003) yet is rarely done in practice. Pulmonary thermodilution requires catheterisation of a pulmonary artery via the jugular vein with a Swan-Ganz catheter. Cold saline is injected and exits the catheter proximal to a thermistor, which senses a change in temperature allowing calculation of CO (Corley et al., 2003). This technique is not suitable for clinical practice due to inaccuracies and the morbidity associated with pulmonary artery catheterisation (Corley & Marr, 2003). The lithium dilution technique has been advocated as more suitable for clinical use (Corley & Marr, 2003). This technique requires central venous and peripheral arterial catheterisation, injection of lithium into the venous system and continuous arterial sampling at 4 ml/min during measurements (Corley et al., 2003; Shih, 2013). This generates a lithium concentration -time curve, from which the CO is calculated (Corley et al., 2003). Lithium dilution is expensive,produces intermittent measures of CO, and the concurrent use of drugs such as atacurium and xylazine interferes with measurements (Ambrisko & Moens, 2014; Shih, 2013). For experienced users, each measurement should require no more than 8 ml of blood to be sampled (Corley et al., 2003), but signi cant blood loss could occur with excessive measurements in very small patients such as neonates.Although considered an invasive technique, appropriate arterial and venous access may already be in place for IBP measurements and fluid therapy. Pulse contour analysis represents a continuous, less invasive method for CO monitoring. It calculates CO from thearterial waveform produced by IBP measurements. Most devices require repeated calibration with lithium dilution or thermodilution techniques (Bendjelid, 2009). Con flicting evidence exists regarding the accuracy of devices inanaesthetised horses and foals (Hallowell & Corley, 2005; Schauvliege et al., 2009; Shih et al., 2009) with noncalibrated devices proving inaccurate (Kutter et al., 2016). Routine clinical use of pulse contour analysis cannot currently be recommended. Measurement of lung volumes, gas pressures and flow Spirometry is the objective, direct measurement of TV used toassess pulmonary function. Compliance is the change in lung volume per unit change in pressure and can also be calculated using spirometry. During mechanical ventilation, peak inspiratory pressure of the normal lung is between 20 and 35 cmH 20 (Mosing & Senior, 2018). Spirometry monitoring during equine anaesthesia most commonly requires a pitottube within the breathing circuit and side stream sensing technology (Herholz, 2010; Moens et al., 2009). Breath-by- breath pressure -volume and flow-volume loops are generated for interpretation (Moens, 2010). The Tafonius(Vetronic Services Ltd) is an example of a large-animalanaesthetic machine with integrated spirometry measurement. Monitoring ventilation volumes can assist in early identi cation of anaesthetic machine and/or ventilator malfunction and obstructions within the airway (Moens, 2010).It can also allow informed decision making regarding mechanical ventilation, particularly where large changes in lung compliance are anticipated (e.g. severe abdominal distension) (Moens, 2013). Volumetric capnography is a technique that combines EtCO 2and ventilation volumes using \u00a92021 EVJ EVE_December22_Text_Print.pdf 61 22/11/22 5:33 PMcapnography and flow sensors enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of expired CO 2kinetics. Exhaled CO 2depends on both airway perfusion and ventilation. Changes in these parameters in fluence the partial pressure of CO 2from gases exhaled from various areas of the lungs (Blankman et al., 2016). This allows identi cation of the functional components of airway volume and measurement of dead space (lung areas that are ventilated but poorly perfused). Both flow and CO 2sensors must be mainstream to facilitate simultaneous measurement (Mosing et al., 2018a;Schramel et al., 2014), and this may increase both resistance and dead space within the anaesthetic equipment. Volumetric capnography is not a common monitoring technique in equine anaesthesia but has been used to diagnose venous air embolism (Sacks & Mosing, 2016) and changes in airway volumes after recruitment manoeuvres in the anaesthetised horse (Ambrisko et al., 2014). Emerging indirect, noninvasive methods to monitor ventilation that are not yet in routine use include electrical impedance tomography and ultrasonic plethysmography. Electrical impedance tomography correlates changes in electrical impedance across the thorax with changes in volumes across different lung regions (Mosing et al., 2017, 2019; Secombe et al., 2019). Ultrasonic plethysmography measures sound wave velocity across the thorax. Measurement bias and the requirement for sensors to be situated on the abdomen so they potentially obstruct surgical access make this method unlikely to replace spirometry inclinical practice (Russold et al., 2013). Electroencephalography Electroencephalography (EEG) is the recording of biologicalelectrical activity from the cerebral cortex using surface electrodes placed on the head. There is a link between EEG activity and anaesthesia in humans and extensive patient data to characterise this (Barnard et al., 2007; Kearse et al., 1994; Kreuer & Wilhelm, 2006; Schneider et al., 2003). Monitoring EEG activity during equine anaesthesia is not common practice due to a lack of supporting evidence demonstrating its usefulness for interpreting plane of anaesthesia (Williams et al., 2016). Bispectral index (BIS) is a numerical scale based on analysis of human EEG data that reflects arousal level. BIS may be able to approximate consciousness in horses and represents a useful indicator ofawakening when horses were anaesthetised with propofol infusions (Yamashita et al., 2009). However, during volatile anaesthesia, BIS has not been demonstrated as a reliable predictor for patient movement (Beldao et al., 2010; Haga & Dolvik, 2002). EEG monitoring and its calculated indices have shown more promise in evaluating nociception under anaesthesia in horses (Johnson et al., 1999, 2000; Murrell et al., 2003, 2005). Drewnowska et al. (2019) has comprehensively reviewed EEG monitoring during equineanaesthesia. Concluding remarks Monitoring the cardiorespiratory system and anaestheticplane form the cornerstones of safe anaesthesia. Monitoring methodologies and associated technology range from simplistic to complex and trends in multiple parameters should be observed. It is recommended to utilise all basic monitoring techniques that require no equipment duringgeneral anaesthesia, such as ocular and mucous membraneassessment and pulse palpation, and document ndings at least every ve minutes. Capnography, pulse oximetry, electrocardiography and blood pressure monitoring (as shown in Fig 7 ) are to be considered as the most appropriate modalities alongside this basic monitoring as a minimumstandard. During prolonged periods of general anaesthesia periods or for sick, high-risk patients, expired gas partial pressures, ABG analysis, temperature and invasive blood pressure assessment is also suggested. If NMBAs are used, a peripheral nerve stimulator is advised to assess depth of blockade in addition to the recommendations as above. These suggestions are similar to the guidelines produced by the American College of Veterinary Anaesthesia Equine Standards Committee (Hubbell & Werner, 2008; Martinez et al., 2008) with the additional consideration of NMBAs. If advanced monitoring such as EEG and spirometry is used, it is essential to understand the theory and limitations of such equipment.

The agent of disease causation that must be present for the condition to occur is strenuous exercise, producing substantial quantities of metabolic heat. This is stored during racing but must be dissipated rapidly in the post-race period to prevent core body temperature rising to a critical level and causing the clinical manifestations of EHI. Environmental factors are next in the epidemiological triad, and it is a common misconception that these are the direct cause of EHI. In fact, environmental conditions enable EHI by either diminishing the evaporative capacity of the environment or promoting internal heat gain. This article deals with the speci c effects of the four thermal elements, separately and in combination, on individual thermo-effectormechanisms. The nal component in the epidemiological triad is individual host factors. A critical premise ofepidemiology is that conditions such as EHI may not occur randomly in a population but may be more likely to occur in some individuals due to the presence of certain factors thatpredispose them to the condition. For the purpose of assessing risk, it is not feasible to examine the balance between metabolic heat production and the intrinsic and extrinsic factors, which collectively determine each individual 's heat stress response. Therefore, the measurement of environmental factors remains the only practical way ofobtaining a credible risk assessment for EHI, so that effective countermeasures can be instigated and the welfare of our racehorses ensured. Introduction The simplest model of disease causation is the epidemiological triad, presented here as a model for EHI to make the understanding of this complex medical condition easier (see Fig 1 ). The agent of causation, which must be presented in all cases for the disease to manifest, is strenuous exercise, typi ed by the intense activity of racing. It generates substantial metabolic heat (Hodgson et al., 1990, 1993), which is stored (Geor et al., 2000) but must be dissipated to the environment in the immediate post-race period by physical heat exchange mechanisms to halt the potential rise in core temperature to critical levels. Although the horse has a superlative thermoregulatory capacity and can dissipate heat mostefciently by evaporation of sweat from the skin and secretions from the upper respiratory tract, certain environmental conditions impair this process, increasing the risk of EHI (Brownlow & Mizzi, 2022a, 2022b; Hodgson et al., 1990, 1993). Individual EHI susceptibility documented in human subjects is considered multifactorial, the risk being greatest when multiple factors combine (Westwood et al., 2020). It is proposed here that environmental conditions act as a catalyst or an enabler to precipitate EHI. Note, however, that it also occurs in certain individuals on cooler days, so that extreme levels of heat and humidity are not an absolute prerequisite for EHI to occur. The question as to why some horses are affected and not others warrants further investigation. The aim of this article was to describe the potential impact of each thermal element in isolation, then to consider their various combinations and how they might collectively impact individual thermo-effector mechanisms, thereby contributing to an understanding of how the weather imposes heat stress conditions. Exertional heat illness is a signi cant welfare issue because the clinical manifestations can be severe, constituting a risk to handlers and horses. Thoroughbred racehorses would appear to be particularly at risk because of the extreme intensity of their exercise activity (Brownlow & Mizzi, 2022a; Hodgson et al., 1993). The only way to prepare for such events is to predict the likelihood of their occurrence by monitoring the weather conditions and putting in placemitigation strategies as required. Prevalence rates for EHI vary greatly. In a retrospective study from South Africa over a period of 21 years there was an overall prevalence of 0.13% in 375,701 horses, but this increased to 1.1% when records of individual horses were examined, with 16% of horses showing more than one episode (MacDonald et al., 2008). Nomura et al. (2019) reported a 20-year retrospective prevalence rate of 0.04% with an upward trend of 0.08% between 2015 and 2018 amongst 975,247 starters. These researchers suggested that the increase in number of horses diagnosed with EHI may have resulted from increased levels of awareness, rather than an actual increase in case numbers. More recently, Brownlow and Brotherhood (2021) reported prevalence rates of 9.0% (437/4809) for Level 1 horses demonstrating the earliest prodromal signs and 0.4% (20/4809) for Levels 2 and 3, where horses were exhibiting signs of central nervous system involvement. It is clear that the case de nition of EHI \u00a92022 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

Notwithstanding which prevalence gures are the most accurate, post-race EHI has become a subject of growing concern for many racingjurisdictions and, with the possibility of global warming, may become the main welfare issue for horse racing in the coming decade. The content of this article and its focus on the role of the essential thermal elements should assist on-track veterinarians to better understand the dynamic nature of the response to strenuous exercise in the context of climatic heat stress. The hyperthermic response to strenuous exercise During strenuous exercise, the principal source of heat acting on the animal 's body is the metabolism associated with muscular contraction, which is largely independent of thethermal environment. Production of metabolic heat increases abruptly at the onset of exercise and is commensurate withexercise intensity and duration. Much of this heat is retainedand distributed throughout the body, raising core body temperature (Geor et al., 2000; Jessen, 2000). The seminal work of Hodgson et al. (1993) showed that if all the metabolic heat was stored, the core body temperature of the racing Thoroughbred could increase by 0.8 \u00b0C per minute, and temperatures of 42.0 \u00b0C have commonly been reported in experimental treadmill studies without clinical manifestations of EHI (Butler et al., 1993; Weishaupt et al., 1996). The fact that EHI can occur in cooler or moderate weather conditions supports the concept that exercise heat production is the primary cause of the condition (Brownlow & Brotherhood, 2021). Immediately after racing, environmental conditions dictate the ef ciency of heat dissipation Once the exercise activity has been completed, the production of metabolic heat decreases dramatically and AGENT OF CAUSATION - STRENUOUS EXERCISE THERMOREGULATION MUST DISSIPATE HEAT TO THE ENVIRONMENT HOST (INTRINSIC) RISK FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO INDIVIDUAL VARIABIITY IN HEAT STRESS RESPONSEIMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL (EXTRINSIC) RISK FACTORS IN COMPROMISING THERMOREGULATION BY ALTERING THE EVAPORATIVE CAPACITY OF THE ENVIRONMENTHeat is stored - may drive core body temperature to critical levels OCCURRENCE OF EXERTIONAL HEAT ILLNESSTHE FOUR THERMAL ESSENTIALS DICTATE HEAT LOSS/ HEAT GAININTRINSIC RISK FACTORS IMPACT INDIVIDUAL THERMO-EFFECTOR MECHANISMS 1. temperature 2.

The skin surface becomes the focus for heat exchange (Jessen, 2000). Rises in skin temperature potentiate convective and evaporative heat loss, and the combination of high core and skin temperatures will provoke heavy sweating (Davies, 1979; Geor et al., 2000; McConaghy et al., 1995). The rate at which heat is lost, however, is almost entirely a function of the cooling power of the environment, which is in fluenced by the combined action of the environmental thermal elements: ambient temperature,radiant heat, water vapour pressure (humidity) and air flow over the skin surface (Brotherhood, 2008; Budd, 2001). Whilsteach acts independently, they will have a combined effect in assisting or hindering thermoregulatory processes (Budd, 2001; Parsons, 2002). The role of individual environmental thermal elements in the thermoregulatory process Radiant heat The sun is the source of radiant heat, and its effect on an animal represents the cumulative effects of direct, re flected and re-radiated solar radiation, the latter two emanatingfrom surrounding surfaces (Parsons, 2002, 2006). High levels of solar radiation are common in hot and sunny climates and can elevate skin temperature by 1.5 -2.0\u00b0C in human athletes (Otani et al., 2016, 2017) and horses (Guthrie & Lund, 1998).Such an increase in skin temperature potentially changes the dynamics of heat transfer, resulting in decreased heat loss and possibly a heat gain (Otani et al., 2021). Animals with darker coloured hair coats may also be more susceptible to radiative heat gains than those with lighter colours (McNicholl et al., 2016; Walsberg et al., 1978). Practical approaches to minimise the effects of radiant heat When the sun is obscured by cloud, the intensity of radiant heat falls. Similarly, shade provided on race day, where horses congregate will shield them from radiant heat. Also, the sun' s progressive change in position during the day results influctuating levels of radiant heat (Blazeiczyk et al., 1999), and this can be used to advantage by changing the times ofracing to correspond with the lower levels. In the 6 h around midday, radiative heat from the sun is at its peak and Otani et al. (2016); Otani et al. (2017); Otani et al. (2019) recorded increasing radiant heat intensity from 09.00 h, peaking at noon and decreasing thereafter, so that racing in the later afternoon and into the night avoids the period of highest radiant heat. Mean radiant temperature (MRT \u00b0C) is the meteorological measurement of radiant heat, and during hotdays in the Australian summer months in some areas, readings of 60 \u00b0C-70\u00b0C, which may be approximately 30 \u00b0C above ambient temperature levels, are commonly observed(Jay & Brotherhood, 2016). Ambient temperature Ambient temperature determines the skin-to-air temperaturedifference, which dictates whether 'dry'heat transfer can operate, where convective and radiative heat exchangesare the major mechanism, or whether the production andevaporation of sweat is required to cool effectively(Brotherhood, 2008; Jessen, 2000). Figure 2 shows the important relationship between skin temperature and airtemperature. At cooler air temperatures ( <35\u00b0C), skin temperature is usually higher than air temperature, so thatheat is readily lost through convective/radiative heat exchange and the body is cooled; but at higher air temperatures, ( >38.0 \u00b0C) skin temperature is exceeded and convective/radiative heat exchange reverses, potentiallyadding heat to the body (Sawka & Young, 2006). At this point, evaporative cooling must compensate for any additional heat gain due to high ambient temperature, as well as dissipating the metabolic heat stored from exercise activity (Brotherhood, 2008; Parsons, 2002). Vapour pressure (absolute humidity) Horses have been described as having the highest sweatingrate in the animal kingdom (Jessen, 2000; McCutcheon &Geor, 1998, 2008) and this is considered the major route of heat loss, but they are also able to dissipate large quantities of heat through the respiratory tract by adopting a panting type of respiration (Brownlow & Mizzi, 2022a; Hodgson et al., 1993). The physical mechanism of evaporative cooling is similar for both pathways, with the vaporisation of fluid from sweat and respiratory secretions resulting in cooling as theheated vapour is transferred to the environment (Jessen, 2000). To understand the risk of EHI, it must be appreciated that environmental evaporative conditions vary, depending upon the level of humidity, and evaporative cooling works best in conditions of low humidity.

When horsesrace in cool conditions (15- 20.0 \u00b0C), their skin temperatures (30- 33.0 \u00b0C) are greater than air temperature, and convective and radiative heat exchanges alone will dissipate much of their heatload. However, at higher air temperatures ( >35.0 \u00b0C) the skin-to-air temperature difference is smaller and convection is reduced, sothat heat loss becomes increasingly dependent on theproduction and evaporation of sweat. Convective coolingbecomes negligible at air temperatures around 36.0\u00b0C andbeyond this point, convective heat exchange reverses and heatis added to the body instead of being lost. The rate of convectivecooling is also profoundly in fluenced by air movement over the skin surface (Image with permission of Dr Michael Sawka, 2011). \u00a92022 The Authors.

A diagrammatic representation of the evaporative process associated with sweating is shown in Figure 3a and a photograph showing vaporisation of sweat after a strenuousworkout to a still environment in Figure 3b . The terminology of atmospheric moisture -relative humidity vs. vapour pressure 'Humidity 'refers to the water vapour content of the air. Relative humidity (RH%) is the term most used in weatherforecasts but is the most misleading and misunderstood humidity variable (Davis et al., 2016). Usually expressed as a percentage, it is the ratio between the amount of water vapour present in the air and the saturation value at the same temperature. Put simply, RH% represents the extent to which the air is saturated. Scrutiny of its calculation, however, reveals thatwhilst the numerator depends on humidity the denominator varies with air temperature. This means that relative humidity can change quite markedly, whilst the air 's actual moisture (the number of water vapour molecules) remains constant.RH% is highest when the air is close to saturation, which usually happens in the early morning and in winter. Thus, RH% typically declines towards the hottest part of the day because it is inversely proportional to ambient temperature (Davis et al., 2016). The term 'vapour pressure 'correlates closely to absolute humidity (Davis et al., 2016) and is associated with the evaporative capacity of the environment, which is of greatest interest to race-day veterinarians because it directly relates to the dissipation of heat and the ef ciency of cooling. Generally, vapour pressure remains constant in any12-h period, so that predicted levels for a given race day are unlikely to change signi cantly. It is most important for users of weather information to appreciate that because RH%depends on both humidity and temperature, its use is limited in any heat stress evaluation where the objective is to ascertain the speci c impact of individual environmental variables. Unlike vapour pressure, relative humidity is notdirectly related to the evaporative capacity of the environment, so is neither reliable nor useful as a guide to the risk of EHI (Brotherhood, 2008; Brownlow & Brotherhood, 2021). To illustrate these concepts, an example of the differences between vapour pressure and the vagaries of RH % are shown in Figure 4a,b , from Jay and Brotherhood (2016). These gures provide a useful illustration for those readers not familiar with the behaviour of the essential thermal elements over a 12-h period. Panel a covers a typical working day from 06:00 to 18:00 in a hot, sunny environment, but indoors, whilst Panel b is outdoors. In Panel a, radiant heat approximates ambient temperature because the location is out of direct sunlight. Predictably, air temperature increasesas the working day progresses, with peak values attained between 14:00 and 16:00 h in both examples. Panel b shows that radiant heat in the outdoor setting peaks closer to 12:00. Radiant heat level is 45 \u00b0C in the shearing shed, compared with 70.0 \u00b0C outdoors. These observations demonstrate the importance of accounting for radiant heat sources when evaluating the risk of EHI where horses race in hot, sunny climates. It is also important to observe the comparative changes in relative humidity. RH% falls as the temperature rises, yet vapour pressure (absolute humidity), the moreimportant measurement for evaporative cooling, remains approximately constant. It can be appreciated from these graphs that the changes to RH% can mislead those monitoring only RH% in the race-day setting. In stable weather, vapour pressure or absolute humidity level (Pa; Pw) remains fairly constant throughout the day and may be predicted from weather forecasting sites using a mobile phone with a simple app. https://www.vaisala.com/en/lp/ humidity-calculator or monitored on-site using a hand-held device (Humicap HM70, Vaisala Corporation). Airflow over the skin surface increases both convective and evaporative cooling The important effects of air flow have been demonstrated in human athletes in the laboratory (see Fig 5 ). Saunders et al. (2005) showed that when there was zero air flow, cyclists exercising strenuously in warm and humid conditionsexperienced excessive levels of heat storage, resulting inelevations to core body temperature. When an air flow of 2.8 m/s was introduced, heat storage fell, due to the initiationof effective thermoregulation. Increasing air flow above 9.0 metres per second, however, produced a non-linearresponse, suggesting that once a certain wind speed was reached, other factors pertaining to the thermoregulatory limitations of the body became more relevant. Airflow over the skin surface alters the immediate thermal environment, dispersing the hot air and vapourised sweat close to the skin and simultaneously increasing the rates of convection and evaporation, thereby accelerating heat loss to the environment. However, it is not only wind speed that affects heat loss but also the temperature of the moving air. A cooler wind will accelerate convective heat loss by increasing the convective gradient and, conversely, a warmer wind may have the reverse effect (Brotherhood, 2008; Budd, 2001). Environmental conditions associated with EHI in temperate eastern Australia From 2014 to 2018, Brownlow and Brotherhood (2021) carried out an observational study to investigate environmental risk factors associated with the occurrence of EHI. Thermal environmental data were measured, including ambient temperature, radiant heat, vapour pressure (humidity) and wind speed, and cases of EHI were collected from amongst 4809 starters at 78 race meetings. Mixed linear regression models were computed to assess the association between the incidence of post-race EHI and the four thermal environmental variables. Analysis showed that vapour pressure and wind speed had the largest effects on the occurrence of post-race EHI. High ambient temperature, low levels of vapour pressure, variable wind speeds There were 23 days on which cases of EHI were observed. Six of those days were classi ed as 'hot ', typically with high levels of radiant heat, and ambient temperatures ranging between36.5\u00b0C and 41.0 \u00b0C. Most importantly, vapour pressure levels were low (0.9 -1.5 kPa) and wind speed was variable. Horses tolerated these conditions well because sweat evaporated freely and heat transfer from the body to the environment was ef cient on most occasions.

Horses competing in 'hot 'conditions tended to have high skin temperatures into the recovery period, usually >39.0 \u00b0C, as measured by infrared thermometer (Brownlow & Smith, 2020). These horses were prioritised as 'at risk' of EHI and were aggressively cooled, the aim being to decrease skin temperature with iced water, whichpotentiates the transfer of heat from a hot core to a coolerskin surface (Brownlow & Mizzi, 2022b). They responded with almost normal recoveries in terms of heart and respiratory rate, level of physiological strain and recovery time. How hot is too hot? Many racing jurisdictions have relied upon ambienttemperature in isolation to answer this seemingly straightforward question, but it is problematic to put in place a maximum cut-off temperature. As previously discussed,Fig 3: (a) First, sweat has to be produced then it must be evaporated to cool the body. Evaporation is a two-step process involving the phase transition of sweat on the skin surface from liquid to vapour (latent heat transfer), followed by the diffusion of vapour into thesurrounding air, which diminishes with increasing humidity. Sweat evaporates freely when the ambient air pressure is low and thegradient from the skin surface to air is wide; but evaporation is impeded when the ambient air pressure is high and the gradient isnarrow. Air movement over the skin surface has a substantial impact on evaporation and higher air velocities increase evaporativeheat transfer. (b) Clouds of water vapour surround this group of horses, sweating after strenuous early morning exercise. The formationofne droplets in the cool, still air renders the vapour visible, providing a graphic illustration of the heat dissipation process. Heat-laden moisture from respiratory secretions can be seen in the exhaled breath of the horse in the immediate foreground. An atmosphere oflow evaporative capacity would hinder this process, causing the sweat to remain on the skin or drip off onto the ground.

Note that the term absolute humidity isused instead of vapour pressure. According to Davis et al.

Nevertheless, when environmental temperatures are >40.0\u00b0C, radiative and convective heat exchanges are reversed, heat is gained, and evaporative cooling must compensate for that extra heat, as well as the metabolic heat stored from racing. Wind speed will dictate the outcome in emergent cases of EHI.Warm ambient temperatures, high levels of vapour pressure (humidity) and variable wind speeds The second type of environmental condition commonly associated with EHI in our racing jurisdiction is that associated with high humidity. There were 17 days when the temperature ranged from 30.0 \u00b0to 35.0 \u00b0C, relative humidity varied between 50% and 80% and, most importantly, vapourpressure was above 2.5 kPa (Brownlow & Brotherhood, 2021). These conditions were considered to represent a high risk of EHI (see Table 1 ). The problem with such days is that because the temperature is relatively low and most racing jurisdictions tend not to measure levels of vapour pressure, the risk associated with racing is underestimated. When vapour pressure levels are high, thermoregulatory capacity is impaired. In the post-race recovery period, horses were dripping with sweat, had elevated heart rates, and exhibited a panting type of respiration. Signi cantly, the recovery time in most cases was extended to at least 60 min and horses so 125 100 75* 50 25 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Zero 2.7 5.5 9.0 Wind Speed (m sec -1)Wind Speed (km h -1)Heat storage (W m -2 h-1) 11.1 13.8 Fig 5: Measurements obtained from human subjects under laboratory conditions, showing the important effects of air flow.

Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.667 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE 22/11/22 5:33 PMaffected were classi ed in race-day reporting as 'slow to recover ', reflecting substantial levels of thermal strain due to the redistributive effects of cardiac output. Horses required aggressive levels of cooling, multiple cooling strategies were often required, and cooling times were generally protracted. In such conditions, horses need to be scraped at the end of the cooling procedure because neither water nor sweat could evaporate effectively from the skin surface. The use of large dry fans increases evaporative cooling in these situations. Airflow dynamics at the racetrack At the racetrack, when heat and/or humidity levels are high,Brownlow and Brotherhood (2021) reported that air flow becomes the determining factor for emergent EHI, with'wind-still 'or calm conditions representing extreme levels of risk (see Table 2 ). Despite the importance of wind speed, it is the most ckle of all the thermal elements. Figure 6a -dshows examples from different venues of how variable wind speeds can affect theclinical expression of EHI. Note that the X-axis represents wind speed in metres/second and the Y-axis represents time. Wind speed can be very unpredictable, varying in time, direction and from location to location. A sudden drop inwind speed can transform an uneventful race day into one on which numerous horses become heat-affected. Cases of EHI most commonly occur after racing and in the 'tie-up ' stalls, which tend to be sheltered areas, characterised by'wind-still 'conditions. These areas may in effect have their own microclimate, with different and changeableevaporative conditions compared with the more open racing and parading areas. Low wind speeds severely compromise evaporative cooling and intermittent wind speeds below 1.5 m/s are likely to precipitate EHI. In contrast, wind speeds greater than 2.5 to 3.0 m/s create excellent conditions for evaporative cooling and can even negate the effects of high vapour pressure (Brownlow & Brotherhood, 2021; Otani et al., 2018). The use of the WBGT \u00b0C (wet-bulb globe temperature) for risk assessment of EHI The WBGT was introduced in 1957 as part of a campaign to prevent heat-related deaths amongst military trainees in theUS Army and Marine Corps (Yaglou & Minard, 1957). Since that time the WBGT has received widespread acceptance, been used during military, occupational, industrial and sporting activities and incorporated into heat policy recommendations by many high-pro le human sporting organisations (Armstrong et al., 2017; Racinais et al., 2015). Ithas also been used for equestrian competitions (Jeffcott & Kohn, 1999; Jeffcott et al., 2009; Schroter et al., 1996) and forms part of heat policy guidelines for Thoroughbred, Standardbred and greyhound racing worldwide (McNicholl et al., 2016). The WBGT is an empirical index based on three measurements, the dry bulb temperature, the natural wet-bulb temperature and the black-globe temperature. Whilst the WBGT does not directly measure air velocity, it is claimed that the effects of wind are re flected in the reading of the natural wet bulb, but it is generally acknowledged that this response isinadequate at low wind speeds and represents a serious shortcoming of the WBGT, particularly in very humid environments, so that some workers have totally revised levelsfor risk assessment if humidity is high (Casa et al., 2017; Periard et al., 2015; Sawka & Young, 2006). Recently, many thermal physiologists have expressed concern that the WBGT is still so widely used despite the expanding knowledge of its substantial limitations, speci cally its failure to appropriately re flect the severity of adverse weather conditions (Brocherie et al., 2014;Brocherie & Millet, 2015; Budd, 2008; D 'Ambrosio Alfano et al., 2014). Proponents reply to criticism by emphasising that theWBGT should not be used to establish participation cut-off values but rather to enable recommendations for implementing preventative countermeasures when the risk of EHI is deemed to be high (Periard et al., 2015). Discussion The epidemiological triad has been introduced as a means of understanding the complexity of EHI. It is commonly thought that the weather is the sole cause of the condition, through exposure of the animal to the direct effects of heat and humidity, but this is not always the case and other intrinsic factors which contribute to individual variability by acting on thermo-effector mechanisms will determine the heat stress response. Nevertheless, being able to predict the effect of weather on a given race day is a most important step in risk analysis and will form the basis of risk mitigation strategies. Belding and Hatch (1955) developed a rational analysis of heat stress, where fundamental physical principles were used to estimate each of the avenues of heat exchange between the body and the environment (see Fig 7 ). Calculation of these exchanges indicated whether thermal balance andcontrol of body temperature could be achieved in the prevailing environmental conditions. A simple conceptual application of this analysis can be quite useful for race-day veterinarians because it directly relates to clinical observations of horses in the post-race period and provides a framework for assessment of an individual animal 's thermoregulatory processes. The required rate of heat transfer for an individual animal to effectively cool is referred to as Ereq. This integratesmetabolic heat production with evaporative, radiative and convective heat exchanges. On hot days, the contributions of radiative and convective losses diminish, even reversing and may become actual heat gain. It is clear that in the immediate post-race period, Ereq relies on the evaporative cooling provided by sweating and this depends not only onthe production of suf cient sweat (Davies, 1979; Nielsen & Nielsen, 1965) but also the evaporation of that sweat(Brotherhood, 2008). The latter is solely determined by environmental parameters and here the thermal elements exert their combined effects to help or hinder the ef cient evaporation of sweat. This variable limit is referred to as Emax,or the evaporative capacity of the environment. Put simply, when Emax exceeds Ereq, the rate of sweat evaporation can meet Ereq, and body temperature can be controlled. Alternatively, if Ereq exceeds Emax, sweat evaporation is insuf cient, heat continues to be stored, body temperature progressively rises, and EHI is a possible outcome. Figure 7 provides an example from the Brownlow and Brotherhood study (2021), of calculated levels for Ereq and Emax on a given race day (from Fig 6 : Venue d). For most of the race meeting, Ereq was greater than Emax and numerous cases ofEHI occurred. Note the profound in fluence of wind speed on \u00a92022 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.668 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / 80 22/11/22 5:33 PMcalculated levels of Emax at certain points in time, diminishing the risk of EHI. For the race-day veterinarian, the theoretical constructs Ereq and Emax can be evaluated subjectively and provide valuable insight into thermoregulatory physiology. Sweating can be assessed in the immediate post-race period. Its characteristics (copious, scant, frothy, slimy, wet) and whether it evaporates rapidly and leaves a dry coat or presents as 'slimy 'skin, with sweat running off dependant portions of the body onto the ground. These observations canbe aligned with ambient weather conditions, providing an evaluation of sweating response (Ereq) and the ef ciency of evaporative cooling (Emax). Prevailing weather conditions do not, however, explain all cases of EHI and it can and does occur on cooler days.Some horses in this category are repeat offenders and display symptoms of EHI every time they compete. Figure 8 , from the Brownlow and Brotherhood (2021) study, is a three-dimensional plot for the top three environmental predictors - vapour pressure (absolute humidity), wind speed andtemperature. The side bar shows the percentage of horses from a race with signs of post-race EHI. Data points with a high percentage of cases are yellow, light green, green andblue-green and probably re flect environmental conditions, which are causing the EHI condition. These coloured datapoints are typically clustered around the known values of vapour pressure and wind speed characteristic of restrictedevaporation. There are, however, numerous outliersrepresenting only one affected horse in a single race, sometimes on a single race day. This suggests that intrinsic risk factors or extrinsic risk factors other than the weather may be causing EHI in these circumstances. From the Brownlow and Brotherhood study (2021), mixed linear regression analyses of association between incidence of post-race EHI and environmental variables were only 43% for all weather elements and this low value agrees with the human experience amongst a variety of athletic, military and occupational settings (Budd et al., 1997; Notley et al., 2019). This residual, unexplained variation is probably attributable to the individual characteristics of the horses or to environmental factors other than the weather in the causation of EHI. Despite the widespread use of the WBGT index, it is an imprecise indicator of environmental stress. Single values do not equate to predictable levels of clinical physiological strain (Budd, 2008) because a wide range of thermal stress can occur for a single value of WBGT. The reading does not differentiate between hot conditions and warm and humid conditions and tends to seriously underestimate the severity of high humidity, which is the cause of most cases of EHI inracehorses. It has also been suggested in the human heat illness literature that sport-context-speci c research needs to be carried out so that policy guidelines can be developedon evidence-based information.

Note that Emax is entirely a function of the environment and is profoundly in fluenced by air flow. Without any change to vapour pressure levels, an increase in air movement increases Emax. This means that during exercise, Emax is greatly enhanced by air movement over the skin surface, but for the stationary animal in the tie-up stalls, Emax can be severely restricted by low air movement. Incircumstances such as shown in this graph, Ereq exceeds Emax. Sweat evaporation proceeds but the rate of evaporation is limited bythe environmental Emax and may not be suf cient to meet Ereq, so that heat storage is unchanged and body temperature may continue to escalate, predisposing the individual to exertional heat illness (EHI). \u00a92022 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.669 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE 22/11/22 5:33 PMperformed by Brownlow and Brotherhood (2021) and these authors have recommended the inclusion of vapour pressure and wind speed in conjunction with the WBGT, which would provide a more accurate assessment of risk for EHI on anygiven race day. To evaluate environmental risk, it is recommended that a predictive weather site be used prior to the race day in question so that an estimation of vapour pressure, wind speed and ambient temperature can be made. For race day it is recommended that one of the hand-held weather measurement devices, such as the Kestrel Heat Stress Tracker (Kestrel Instruments) with anemometer and wind vane, be positioned in the vicinity of the tie-up stalls to monitor weather conditions in real time. This device is relatively inexpensive, easy to use and provides a WBGT reading in conjunction with ambient temperature and relative humidity, from which vapour pressure can be calculated using the recommended app. Wind speed will complete the picture. This provides the race-day veterinarian with suf cient information to know whether conditions are likely to bedifcult or relatively easy in terms of management of numerous or only a few heat-affected horses.Conclusion Exertional heat illness is, as the name suggests, a complex illness where metabolic heat is causal and strenuous exercise is the inciting agent. There are certain misconceptions, which add confusion to understanding the illness. Firstly, it is thought that ambient weather conditions cause EHI and that it is associated mainly with extreme heat (high ambient temperatures), so that many racing jurisdictions use temperature cut-off points for cancellation of events. This means that conditions that have been shown to be most perilous for racehorses, such as mid-temperatures with high vapour pressure, may tend to be disregarded as signi cant heat events but will actually cause the majority of EHI cases. Exertional heat illness is considered to be preventable, but this depends upon awareness of all aspects of the condition.Besides a knowledge of the superb thermoregulatory capacity of the racehorse, the clinical manifestations of EHI, its pathophysiology and treatment rationale, it is the thermalessentials operating on a particular race day, which demand attention and allow the most accurate prediction of risk. Intrinsic risk factors, although of vital importance, are essentially unavailable for risk assessment unless the individual animal becomes a repeat offender, which signals more intense heat mitigation strategies for that animal. Finally, to summarise, the thermal elements act independently from each other and from metabolic heat production to alter the physical characteristics of the environment, so that on hot days they will promote heat gains and decrease the transfer of heat from the hot core to the skin surface; on humid days they combine to restrict the efciency of evaporative cooling. In both cases, wind speed will play a critical role in the outcome. Understanding the roleof the thermal elements allows a rational assessment of the risk of EHI and the requirements for supporting infrastructure, such as cooling devices and extra personnel to supervise cooling and care for horses. It is recommended that both vapour pressure and wind speed become incorporated into race-day risk-assessment protocols. Climate change experts have predicted higher levels of heat and humidity, which means that EHI could become an increasingly signi cant welfare issue during the next decade.
