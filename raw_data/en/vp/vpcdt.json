I have appreciated your perspective and willingness to help me improve my thesis v ABSTRACT In the United States, the use of complementary and alternative medicine (usually referred to as CAM) has increased dramatically over the last three decades. However, theoretically informed explanations about why people decide to use CAM therapies are lacking. The purpose of this study is to determine if there is enough statistical evidence to justify additional research on the relationship between social learning and the decision to use CAM. Working on the assumption that people make decisions bas ed on information they have or can obtain, I applied the concept of learning bias in order to examine the ways in which people gain information about CAM. I used a subsample of n=9991 from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and results from 1 2 semi -structured contextual inquiry interviews in a mixed -methods approach. Statistical evidence from Chi-square tests of independence indicated that a relationship between CAM and social learning bias does exist. However, results also indicated that the relationship is dependent on the type of therapy used. Additionally, the contextual inquiry interviews revealed that upbringing influences later -in-life predispositions towards learning biases favorable to CAM usage. I also found that individuals different iate between recommendations from friends and co -workers as well as those from parents and other family members. These differences are not made clear in the standard models of learning bias. I discuss how the results of this study illuminate people 's decisions to use CAM, they relate to the way bias is modeled, and use of this knowledge to inform future studies . vi TABLE OF CONTENTS Understanding Why People Use Complementary and Alternative Medicine ......... 1 Definitions ................................ ................................ ................................ ................ 2 Purpose of Research Question and Hypotheses 4 Significance of Historical Context ................................ ................................ ........................ 5 CAM Use and Expenditures by The Public ................................ ................. 6 CAM Expenditures at the National Level ................................ .................... 8 Implications ................................ ................................ ................................ ..9 CHAPTER TWO: REVIEW OF LITERATURE ................................ .............................. 11 Complementary and Alternative Medicine ................................ ............................ 11 History, Context, and Definition ................................ ................................ 11 vii Policy, Regulations, and the National Health Survey ................................ 13 Research Post -1991 ................................ ................................ of Human Subjects 27 Data Cleaning Descriptive Statistics ................................ ................................ .................. 29 Types ................................

In 2012 alone, 59 million pe ople spent $30.2 billion dollars on some kind of alternative or complementary health product or service (Nahin, Barnes, and Stussman 2016). This type of expenditure by such a large portion of the population leads both public policy makers and the health industry to be interested in discovering why people decide to forgo or complement conventional medical treatment with traditional, homeopathic, natural, and alternative medical options. During the last three decades there have been multiple debates around CAM, including whe n, how, or if CAM -related therapies should be incorporated into the education of medical students, the efficacy of CAM therapies, safety of CAM for public use, need for more stringent FDA guidelines , and methods for targeting public servic e messages (Bausell correlations between the use of CAM therapies and speci fic subjects such as chronic pain, education levels, and ethnic backgrounds, there has been a lack of theoretically informed explanations about how or why people decide to use CAM therapies (Barnes et al. 2004; Carboon 2008; Clarke et al. 2015). My study a ddresses this deficiency by using the cultural evolution theoretical framework of 2 social learning hypotheses to examine people 's decision to use CAM therapies. This has additional significance because st udies of social learning biases largely under the umbrella of cultural evolutionary theory have emphasized theoretical modeling over empirical inquiries. This study combines the theoretical framework of cultural evolution with empirical analyses of decisions to utilize CAM, adding theoretical power to st udies of CAM and empirical data to cultural evolutionary theory . Definitions Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) refers to those medical and health services, treatments, activities, or practices that do not require a licensed medical doctor's invo lvement, approval, and/or input (e.g., yoga, acupuncture, faith healing, shamanism, P ilates, diet fads, massage, etc. ) or those products which do not require prescriptions that are used to treat or prevent medical and health problems and issues (e.g., magn ets, non -vitamin supplements, herbal remedies, folk medicine, homeopathic substances, teas, extracts, infusions, etc. ). Social Learning , also referred to as cultural transmission , is information passed between people through copying, learning, or teaching rather than through genetic transmission or individual learning (i.e., learning through trial and error ). Learning bias , also referred to as transmission bias, is the differential preference for information resulting from preferences for one source over an other. Purpose of Study Acting on the assumption that people make decisions based (partially or fully) on inform ation they have or can acquire either through trial and error (individual learning) or from others, I decided to examine the ways in which peopl e gain information about CAM 3 from others . Cultural evolutionary theory posits that information is transmitted through three channels: individual learning, genetic inheritance , and social learning. Examples of social learning include language, teaching, and imitation (Henrich and McElreath 2007; Mesoudi, Whiten, and Dunbar 2006; Richerson and Boyd 2005). This process of non - genetic information transfer is referred to as either cultural transmission or social learning. Cultural evolutionary theory further pos its that some types of information are favored over others (i.e. , are biased) . This differential treatment of information is referred to as either cultural transmission bias or social learning bias. Social learning biases can be generally categorized as either content or context biases. Figure 1.1 illustrates the organization of the various forms of social learning mechanisms. Content biases arise when people acquire behaviors, ideas, beliefs, or values which act like mental templates . A person may be more likely to acquire a certain new idea, behavior, value, or belief because it \"fits\" this template. In other words, content bias is a learning bias based on what is being learned depending on the content of the idea , skill, or value (Boyd and Richerson 1985 ; Henrich and McElreath 2003; Henrich and McElreath 2007). Context bias is preferential learning from other people based on source of information (the \"model\"), or how common the behavior or idea is (\"frequency\"). In other words, an individual may prefere ntially learn from a skilled, successful, or prestigious person rather than from someone who is not. Individuals may also show a preference for learning from models who share some similarity with themselves. This similarity may be shared ability, backgroun d, gender, social status, ethnicity, or language, among a host of other potential markers. On the other hand, a person may show a 4 preference toward simply learning a common behavior, or conversely, preferring a rare behavior or trait (Henrich and McElreat h 2007 ) Figure 1 .1 Organizational Diagram of Learning Biases If there is no relationship between CAM use and social learning, or if the relationship has no significant value, then in -depth studies run the risk of wasting both time and money. Therefore, I am taking a first step in understanding the relationship between learning biases and the use of CAM by determining if there is enough evidence to justify additional further research. Research Question and Hypotheses The general research question that guide s this study is whether the source of information influence s the use of CAM . I looked for evidence that learning biases were generally associated wi th people's decision s to use CAM and that people 's decisions to use specific therapies are dependent on the information source ( e.g., a person may use acupuncture because a friend recommended it but drink herbal tea because one's mother recommended it). Specifically, I explored two hypotheses: (1) If biased social learning is 5 influencing people's decisions to us e CAM , then there will be a significant association between social learning biases and the use of CAM therapies in general ; (2) If people are differentially using information dependent on the type of CAM therapy then individual therapy types will be signif icantly associated with different types of learning biases. Significance of Study Historical Context Histori cally, the use of CAM therapies a rose concurrent with the rise of modern medicine. In the 1800s the use of homeopathy began to increase as a direct response to the perceived inadequacies of modern medical techniques and practices until its use dwindled in the 1930s and then subsequently experienced a semi -revitalization in the 1990s (Haller 2005). The use of other forms of alternative and unconvention al types of medical treatments also appeared to show an increase in the 1990s. Whether this was a response created by public perception about the limits of conventio nal modern medicine or was due to some other reason is unknown, although some scholars have tied it to the concurrent rise of the \"New Age\" movement (Baer 2003). Beginning in the late 1980s to early 1990s , both health professionals and policy makers began to seriously investigate CAM and gather statistical information on costs and use. Unfortuna tely, there is no systematic gathering of information on CAM expenditures other than the CDC's National Health Sur vey Alternate Health Supplement . Beginning in 2002, the supplement is attached to the main survey every fifth year. This means that informatio n is sporadic and cannot be considered as completely accurate comparisons because each researcher had a different focus and used different criteria. 6 CAM Use and Expenditures by T he Public The economic impact and rising popularity of complementary and alt ernative medicine (CAM) over the last three decades has created a need to understand the use of CAM by the U.S. public. In 1990, Americans made more visits (425 million) to CAM providers than to primary care physicians (355 million). They also spent almost $10.3 billion out -of-pocket on CAM products, comparable to $12.8 billion spent on all hospitalizations in the United States (Eisenberg et al. 1993). Since that time, use of CAM has continued to expand, keeping pace with the explosive growth of conventiona l medical care. Graph 1.1 1990 -2012 Expenditure Comparison: CAM vs Physician Between 1990 and 1997, use of CAM increased by 25% and total out -of-pocket expenditures increased by approximately 45%. In 1997, more money was invested in CAM than conventional medicine: out -of-pocket expenditures for all U.S. physicians reached $29.3 billion, while the estimated total for out -of-pocket expenditures on CAM therapies was $33.4 billion (Eisenberg et al. 1998). Although the spending rate of CAM 7 therapies and produc ts seemed to slow or level off after a surge in the late 1990s, a 2004 study examining data from the 2002 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) determined that 62% of adults over 18 had used CAM at least once in the prior 12 months (Barnes et al. 2004). This would indicate that the use of CAM was continuing to be prevalent . Table 1.1 1990 -2012 Conventional Medicine and CAM Comparison In 2007, 83 million adults spent $33.4 billion out -of-pocket on complementary and alternative medicine, which equated to 11.2% of total out -of-pocket expenditures on health care (Nahin et al. 2009). CAM expenditures seemed to have leveled out by 2012 with more recent studies indicating that 38.3% of all adults in the U.S. reported some type of expenditure for CAM therapies o r products at an estimated cost of $30.2 billion dollars (Nahin, Barnes, and Stussman 2016). This is still a very large segment of the population spending a significant amount of money, which is one of the reasons out-of-pocket expenditures YearPhysician Visits (millions)Physician and Clinical $ (billions)Hospital $ (billions)Cam Provider Visits (millions)Cam Provider $ (billions)Cam products $ (billlions) Study 1990 388 23.5 12.8 425 $11.7 $10.3 (Eisenberg 1993) 1997 386 29.3 11.03629 2016) 1.

CMS National Health Expenditure Data, CY 1960-2016 (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2018).out-of-pocket expendituresCAM Conventional Medicine8 understanding CAM use has become an area o f interest for health professionals, scholars, and policy makers. CAM Expenditures at the National Level The amount of money spent by the public indicates that something is occurring regarding healthcare decisions among a significant portion of the populac e. However, not only do individuals spend billions each year on CAM therapies and products, but al so government expenditures are quite significant. During the last three decades, Congress has steadily increased appropriations to investigate and disseminate information about CAM, reflecting the continuing interest of policy makers in understanding the relatively widespread and growing use of CAM therapies. Recognizing a need to address the public's interest and use of CAM, in 1991 the U.S. Congress provided two million dollars in funding to evaluate and investigat e unconventional medical practices (NIH 2017). Then in 1992, the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) was officially created to study and evaluate complementary and alternative medicine and to make t hat information available to the public. Toufexis (1993) remarked that OAM was created \"under pressure from a Congress alarmed by the soaring costs of high -tech healing and the frustrating fact that so many ailments AIDS, cancer, arthritis, back pain have yet to yield to standard medicine\" (para. 3). In 1998, the OAM budget had increased to $19.5 million dollars annually. Additionally, the OAM was renamed the National Center of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) and elevated to an independen t National Institutes Health Center (NCCIH 2016 b; NIH 2017). In a 2014 omnibus budget measure, NCCAM's name was changed to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) with an 9 increased funding of $124 million. In 2017, the budget f or NCCIH expanded to $130.5 million. Graph 1.2 1992 -2017 NCCIH Funding Implications Beyond understanding why people take herbal supplements or practice Yoga instead of consulting a medical doctor, exploring the decision making process about health has a much greater reach. Identifying how health decisions are made may also help address greater questions about why people decide to circumvent other conventional modern medical treatments such as vaccinations (Tafuri et al. 2014). Public policy makers have also been concerned with underserved and vulnerable populations using CAM instead of conventional medicine (White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy 2002) . Understanding how to address these concerns requires understanding th e reasons and influencing factors in making these decisions. Having a theoretical basis for understanding why people reject or supplement 10 standardized treatments viewed by those in the medical field as good common sense (and necessary for public and indivi dual health) may help formulate proper responses to these types of issues. Additionally, studying health decisions through the framework of social learning not only applies theory to real world problems but also imparts greater insight into the mechanisms of social learning . 11 CHAPTER TWO : REVIEW OF LITERATURE Complementary and Alternative Medicine History, Context, and Definition A universal definition of CAM is not available, although medical practices not conform ing to the current standards of the medic al community are referr ed to variously as \"traditional, \" \"unconventional, \" \"complementary 2016 2010 a). CAM is often defined negatively , that is as not being a health therapy, product, practice, or service considered to be within the purview of mainstream conventional medicine. The division between conventional medicine and CAM began in the U.S. in the early to mid-1800s when alternative medical prac titioners bega n to compete with professionals who practiced \"conventional\" medicine. Intentionally offering \"safe\" and \"natural\" therapies based on theories of healing that stressed the emotional and spiritual aspects of health to distinguish themselves from practitione rs of conventional medicine, such practi tioners appealed to many people. This led to active and often contentious competition between alternative and conventional medical practitioners for status, recognition, patients, and patronage (Kantor 2009). In the early to mid -20th century, the application of licensure laws, federal drug regulations, mandatory education, clinical trials, and rigorous scientific inquiry gave conventional medicine dominance over alternative medicine. However, public interest in CAM wa s renewed in the 1970s and intensified during the 1990s. The increased interest 12 and use of CAM is partially the paradoxical result of the successes of conventional treatments, drugs, and therapies. People expected that conventional medicine would be capabl e of combating any illness or health problem. When conventional medicine could not cure or solve their health issues, people turned to CAM for solutions (Kantor 2009; U.S. Senate 1998, 80). In addition, as the prevalence of chronic conditions has increased , along with a growing dissatisfaction with the perceived impersonalization and commercialization of conventional medicine, the use of CAM has continued to grow. In a hearing on Support Strategies for Clinical Research and Alternative Medicine Research at the NIH before the Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, Dr. Gordon H. Williams stated that the public's increased interest in and use of CAM indicated that \"there is a revolution going on in medicine and in health care in this country\" (U.S. Senate 19 98, 80). \"Complementary\" and \"alternative\" medicine have been the most terms used to describe unconventional therapies since the 1990s. However, defining exactly whether a therapy is a CAM therapy is contested mainly because determining what is considered conventional or \"mainstream\" medicine is not always clear and the acceptance and perception of therapies can change over time (Dittman 2004; Institute of Medicine 2005). For example, chiropractic therapies are now considered both mainstream and complementa ry, although the American Medical Association (AMA) once viewed chiropractic therapy as an \"unscientific cult\" and even created a Committee on Quackery to eliminate the practice (Johnson et al. 1946, 406). To complicate matters even more, \"Complementary an d Integrative Medicine\" is the term currently being used by the NIH to separate therapies used in conjunction with conventional medicine from \"alternative\" 13 therapies used in place of conventional medicines (NCCIH 2016 a). For the purpose of this study, the more historically common term \"Complementary and Alternative Medicine\" or \"CAM\" will be used when discussing unconventional medical therapies and products. I am defining CAM as those medical and health services, treatments, activities, and practices that d o not require a licensed medical doctor's involvement, approval, and/or input and any product used for hea lth reasons or treatment that does not require a prescription . This definition includes a wide variety of therapies including yoga, acupuncture, faith healing, shamanism, Pilates, diet fads, massage, magnets, non - vitamin supplements, herbal remedies, folk medicine, homeopathic substances, teas, extracts, and infusions among many others. Although vitamins are technically a CAM product, they are treated a s mainstream by the majority of health professionals and most researchers. Studies often present dual results with vitamins included and excluded as CAM products (Nahin et al. 2009). Policy, Regulations, and the National Health Survey Believing that conve ntional medicine was ignoring the potential of alternative medicine, Sen. Tom Harkin (D -Iowa) added a $2-million -dollar provision that established the Office of Alternative Medicine to Title 404E, Section 601 of the 1991 Public Health Service Act (Ember 19 98; NIH 1998). The mandate of this newly formed office was to \"facilitate the evaluation of alternative medical t reatment modalities\" (NIH 1998 , para. 2). In 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) created a new regulatory framework for dietary supplements. This moved supplements from the category of \"drug\" to that of \"food\" and the F ood and Drug Administration was \"not 14 authorized to review dietary supplement products for safety and effectiveness\" (FDA 2017b , para. 2). In addition, th e FDA's responsibility was downgraded to simply \"taking action against any adulterated or misbranded dietary supplement product after it reaches the market\" (FDA 2017a , para. 3). The distributors and manufacturers now evaluated the safety and effectiveness of their own products, and as long as they properly labeled those products with disclaimers and ingredients, they were essentially free to market them as they saw fit. There was now no official means of determining the efficacy of most supplements , and th ere were doubts regarding compliance with safety protocols and documentation. This con cern would seem to be justified: supplements that used new (post -1994) ingredients were supposed to have safety data submitted to the FDA, but as of 2012, adequate notifi cation was only received for 170 new ingredients , while the number of supplements marketed skyrocketed from an estimated 4,000 to over 55,000 (Cohen 2012). Whether or not those 170 reported ingredients were used to manufacture the additional 51,000 product s, or if new ingredients were used and not reported to the FDA , is beyond our concerns here. Recognizing inadequacy in available large -scale data, in 2002 the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) added a Complementary and Alternative Medicine Supplement (cond ucted every five years) to the yearly National Health Interview Survey (CDC 2017). This supplement gathers data on the use of CAM and combines it with other data on health and demographics , allowing researchers, policy makers, and medical experts to \"ident ify and address health issues [and]... to help guide public health and heal th policy decisions\" (CDC 2017 , para. 1). 15 Research Post-1991 Much of the research since 1991 has focused on demographics, treatment efficacy, and correlations with specific medical conditions. This focus on descriptive statistics, clinical trials, and proximate explanations was partially due to three factors: the language of OAM's mandate, the drive of conventional and CAM practitioners to either disprove or prove the efficacy and sa fety of CAM, and the need of both policy makers and medical professionals to understand why people were using CAM. However, despite a purported concern for reasons people use CAM, studies have act ually addressed two questions: w ho uses CAM, and are CAM tre atments effective. Focus on E fficacy - St. John's Wort as an E xample Much of the research performed by medical professionals has focused on efficacy and safety. One of the first studies conducted post -1994 examined the effectiveness of Hypericum perforatu m (St. John's wort) in treating major depression. Linde et al. (1996) conducted a meta -analysis of 23 randomized trials that were performed between 1979 and 1984. Not one of these trials had been publicized in the U.S. , and the authors of the meta - analysis noted they also found issues with double publication, lack of proper referencing to prior publication, authorship acknowledg ement, lack of information on long-term side effects , and inconsistent herbal extract preparation, as well as inconsistency and vagueness in the classification of depression. The authors of the meta -analysis remarked, \"Given the large number of possible sources of variation on one side and the relatively small number of trials, we refrained from performing subset analyses\" (Linde et a l. 1996, 257). Despite these issues, the authors concluded that \"We believe there is good evidence 16 that hypericum is better than placebo in treating some depressive disorders\" (Linde et al. 1996, 257). The results of a clinical trial funded by NCCIH (then NCCAM) were publicized in 2002 that pointed out the same issues the meta -analysis documented as well as noting that subsequent studies ha d similar issues. This eighteen -month , randomized, double blind , placebo -controlled trial (n=340) tested the efficacy and safety of H. perforatum for treating major depression disorder between 1998 and 2000 (Hypericum Depression Trial Study Group 2002). Results indicated no significant difference between H. perforatum and placebo, leading to the conclusion that the study failed to support the efficacy of St. John's wort in treating depression (see Appendix A for the actual statistical results). The NCCIH website states that St. John's wort is not consistently effective for treating depression and warns the public that use can be potentially life threat ening because of drug interactions. They refer to the 2002 study as their main source for this determination (NCCIH 2018). Although St. John's wort is just one of the hundreds of supplements available, it is a prime example o f the focus of medical studies on the effectiveness and safety of CAM treatments. However, studies on treatments other than supplements are not as heavily focused on efficacy. Focus on sociology, demographics, and medical conditions An examination of who uses CAM has been the focus of study in the search for understanding the use of CAM in the United States. A review of the literature show s that even when researchers specifically state they are examining reasons for people us ing CAM, they are actually dete rmining who uses CAM (Astin 1998; Barnes, Bloom, and 2007; 2007; Upchurch and Rainisch 2012; Ernst 2000; Clarke et al. 2015; Field et al. 2009) Using data from the 2007 National Health Survey, Barnes, Bloom, and Nahin (2007) examined CAM use in the previous 12 months. Their report focused almost entirely on sociodemographics and described who was more likely to use CAM, what therapies were selected most often, and what medical conditions were treated most frequently (Barnes, Bloom, and Nahin 2007). For example, Grzywacz et. al (2007) looked at age and ethnicity, Field et. al (2009) found that that women with breast cancer who used CAM were more likely to have a higher education level, and Clarke et. al (2015) published a report on trend s in CAM use indicating that supplements were most popular. In addition to looking at therapy being used, type of person using it , and condition being treated , further studies attempt to explain CAM use through social affiliation or ideology. The best exa mple of this type of study is Dr. John A. Astin's 1998 national study in which he sought to understand why people used CAM. He stated that there was \"no clear or comprehensive theoretical model to account for the increasing use of alternative forms of heal th care\" (1548). He tested three hypotheses (which he referred to as theories): (1) Dissatisfaction with conventional treatment; (2) Need for personal control; and (3) Philosophical congruence ( i.e., CAM was compatible with a person's existing worldview, v alues, or beliefs). The results indicated that dissatisfaction with conventional treatment did not predict use of CAM, but having poorer health and a higher education did, and that people did in fact use CAM because it was compatible with their philosophic al worldview (Astin 1998). The philosophical worldview that Astin used as a 18 model was derived from sociologist Dr. Paul H. Ray's concept of \"Cultural Creatives ,\" people who adhere to what he terms a trans -modernism worldview (Ray 1997). Trans - modernism inc ludes values and beliefs that embrace ideologies such as feminism, environmentalism, equality, spiritualism, social activism, and globalism. This corresponds quite closely with thought styles that other sociologists label \"new age.\" Of particular interest in this study is that Astin (1998) thought that the potential influence of others on people's decision to use CAM was a limitation in his study. Indeed, he notes that it made prediction \"quite difficult\" (Astin 1998, 1553). Of all the literature I reviewed , Astin's study came closest to recognizing that social learning could be influencing people's decisions to use CAM. Unfortunately, no research has yet explored the role social learning plays. In fact, the Institute of Medicine (2005) reported that It has widely been reported that information about CAM is often spread by word of mouth within social networks and that referral by lay individuals is common [emphasis added]...the committee found no study that investigated the impact of one person's CAM involveme nt on that person's immediate family or larger social network (58). Social Learning Logically, if there are concerns about people using CAM , then research should focus on process in making those decisions and influences upon them . However, current and pa st studies have focused on proximate causes: demographics, costs, and efficacy of therapy types. Although these studies promote our general understanding of CAM usage, they do not have a unifying theoretical stance that may explain how people are making these decisions in the first place. 19 I suggest that cultural evolutionary theory gives us a unifying framework through which we can examine how people are making decisions about their health in general but more specifically about using CAM. Cultural evolutio nary theory posits that information is transmitted through different channels : genetic inheritance , individual learning, and social learning (Henrich 1985; Richerson and Boyd 2005). I am not going to address or explain genetic inheritance or individual learning in this thesis as the focus of this study is on the third channel - social learning . Social learning is the transmission of information through methods such as language, teaching, and imitation. Cultural evolutionary theory also postulates that certain types of information may be favored or biased over other types of information, and that people acquire information through different pathways (Takahasi Richerson and Boyd 2005). When discussing different ways information is transmitted socially through learning, copying, and imitating, we are referring to the learning biases in play. As I discussed previo usly in Chapter One, learning biases are characterized as either content or context biases. Content biases are based on what is being learned . People acquire behaviors, beliefs, values, and ideas through social learning that may act as a contextual cue or mental template. When introduced to a new behavior or concept, a person may more likely accept and acquire it because it fits with this mental template or triggers the cue (Kutty, and Boyd 200 5). 20 Figure 2.1 Content Bias Context biases , however, are based on who something is being learned from (i.e., the \"model\") or how common something is. These types of biases utilize cues from the people being learned from. These people are used as models (t emplates) rather than the thing learned. Because information is costly to acquire, individuals may do better if they have a preference for learning and paying attention to other people who are more skillful, have high status or prestige , or are highly succ essful. Individuals who selectively learn from other people who are more likely to have adaptive skills or knowledge may be more likely to outdo individuals who do not selectively learn from others (Henrich and McElreath 2007, 558). Figure 2.2 Context Bia s Context biases that are preferentially acquired based on cues triggered by the characteristics of the model , are sub-classified as model -based biases (see Figure 2.3) . These are biases based on the skill, success, or prestige of the mode l. They may be al so based on shared similarities such as ability, language, ethnicity, age, or gender (Henrich and McElreath 2007). Skill -based bias relies on direct knowledge or observation of the model's skill or competence. An individual may observ e two different peo ple performing the same skill; if one person is more skillful than the other , then that person is the preferred model. For example, each of two different people is each building a shelter; the first builder's shelter leaks, has gaps in the walls, and is unste ady. The other builder's 21 shelter has a good roof, does not have gaps in the walls, and is very sturdy and safe. In this situation, the theoretical framework of social learning biases posits that an individual observing the difference in skill will preferen tially learn from the more skillful builder. This type of preferential learning is much less costly than learning from just anyone or learning through trial and error (Boyd and Richerson 1985; Henrich and McElreath 2007; Moya and Henrich 2016) . Figure 2.3 Model -based Biases Success -based cues are less direct and rely more on assumption ( i.e., if someone is successful, we assume they have better skills). These cues ma y be symbols of wealth or health and vary d epending on the particular social context . In on e society, success may be measured by the car a person drives, where in another by the number of wives a person has. Thus, t he social context then relates to skill domain. By preferentially acquiring the behaviors or skill of a successful model that relate to a particular skill domain, an individual can avoid the costlier learning of trial and error. Success -biased learning can be less costly than skill -based biased learning because competence may at times be 22 difficult to discern , in which case cues of succ ess more accurate ly identify who to learn from (Boyd and Richerson 1985; Henrich and McElreath 2007; Moya and Henrich 2016). Prestige -based learning bias also can indirect ly evaluate a model's competence and save on learning costs. If successful and skillf ul models are in high demand, then individuals will need to compete for access to them. This creates selection pressure on learners to show deference to those models that are determined to have the best information or be of the most benefit ( i.e., have the most adaptive information). In exchange for preferred access and learning assistance, learners show deference in many forms, such as public praise, doing favors or providing gifts. In novel situations, na\u00efve learners may not have information on the compet ence or success of potential models. However, they can use cues from existing patterns of deference to determine underlying skill and competence (Atkisson, O'Brien, and Mesoudi 2012; Boyd and Richerson 1985; Gibson Lawson and Gil -White 20 01; Henrich and McElreath 2007). Learning can also be biased based on similarity. A learner may be concerned with the compatibility of their newly gained knowledge with their own abilities, experiences, limitations, or circumstances. This may change prefer ences, giving those models who are more similar to the learner more \"weight .\" For example, a novice female business major may give preference to learning from a successful female model over learning from a male model because the learner may perceive that t he female model shares more experiences (Henrich and McElreath 2003; Henrich and McElreath 2007). Frequency -based biases reflect how common a particular skill, trait, behavior, or idea is among other individuals in a par ticular setting. In information -sparse 23 environments, the least costly learning mechanism for adaptive learners may be to copy the majority. Henrich (2007) gives the following example: Suppose every individual is given a noisy signal (a piece of information) from the environment about what t he best practice is in the current circumstances. This information, for any one individual, might give them a 60% chance of noticing that blowguns bring back slightly larger returns than bows. Thus, using individual learning alone, learners will adopt the more efficient hunting practice with probability 0.60. But, if an individual samples the behaviour of 10 other individuals, and simply adopts the majority behaviour, his chances of adopting the superior blowgun technology increase to 75% (563). This logic can be applied to supplement an individual's imperfect information about the relative success of potential models. Although some individuals are able to selectively copy successful models, they will be unable to accurately determine levels of success. By adopti ng the traits and behaviors of the majority, a second group can still take advantage of the information acquired by a first group (Henrich and McElreath 2007). Boyd and Richerson (1985) have meticulously tested the reasoning underlying learning bias through analytical modeling. Such reasoning has also been tested using evolutionary simulations of more complex environments (Henrich and Boyd 1998; Kameda and Nakanishi 2002; Muthukri shna, Morgan, and Henrich 2016). But although there were ample formal ma thematical modeling and simulations performed on learning biases , there have been fewer empirical tests of those models (Acerbi and Alexander Bentley 2014; Boyd and 2016; Takahasi 1998). The purpose of my study is not to add to the already extensive body of mathematical modeling but to explore the dynamics of social learning by applying real data to existing models. Thi s allows me to empirically test hypotheses 24 about the relationship between CAM use and social learning biases to determine if future in-depth study and testing on that relationship is feasible . 25 CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY Mixed Methods To examine the role l earning biases may play in decision s to use CAM, I chose to use a mixed methods approac h. Mixed methods can be defined as \"research in which the investigator collects and analyzes data, integrates the findings, and draws inferences using both qualitative a nd quantitative approaches or methods in a single study or a program of inquiry\" (Tashakkori and Creswell 2007,4). Mixed methods is a pragmatic, question driven approach that utilizes induction, deduction, and abduction to discover patterns, test hypothese s, and uncover the best explanations for understanding results (Creswell 2003; Johnson et al. 2004). Specifically, I used an explanatory sequential mixed methods design ( QUAN qual). In this type of design, quantitative data is collected first and inform s the collection of the qualitative data. Qualitative data in turn helps explain the findings from the quantitative data (Creswell et al. 2011). Figure 3.1 Explanatory Sequential Design In the first, quantitative phase of the study, existing data was acqu ired from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey to test how learning biases relate to the use of 26 CAM. The second, qualitative phase was conducted to gain a deeper perspective on individual perceptions about CAM and who influenced its use . In this phase , the relationship between social learning and the use of CAM was explored in -depth with 12 interviewees from the greater Boi se, Idaho area. T he exploratory follow -up intends to help explain or build o n initial quantitative results (Creswell and Plano Clar k, 2011). A mixed methods approach was essential to this study because the survey data, while suitable for quantitative analysis, left many details unclear. The follow -up wit h contextual interviews provides in-depth descriptions of individual experiences a nd decision making process . Once all the data was analyzed, I integrated the findings and formulated the conclusions. Quantitative Analysis Data S ource For the quantitative analysis, this project used data from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey (N HIS) Adult Alternative Medicine (ALT) supplement and the Family Core and Sample Adult components. The NHIS is a cross -sectional, nationally representative household interview survey with various components and supplements . It is conducted continuously by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS ) to produce annual estimates of health for the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. These interviews are conducted in home s using a computer -assiste d personal interview questionnaire. All personal identifiers are removed , and the data are made public . A detailed description of the NHIS survey questionnaire and sample design is available elsewhere (NCHS 2012). 27 The NHIS Family Core and Sample Adult comp onents collect general health and demographic information about each member of all families within a sampled household. Further, one adult aged 18 and older is randomly selected for the collection of additional information. Each household, family, and indi vidual is assigned a unique identifier, whereby data can be cross -referenced and merged from different components of the NHIS. Although the NHIS releases yearly health estimates, the Adult Alternative Medicine supplement is only produced every five years. For the purpose of this study, the 2012 data was the most current dataset on CAM available from the NCHS. Safety of Human Subjects For the quantitative portion of this study, existing data available from the CDC's 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHI S) was used. All personal identifiers had already been removed. No recruitment or interaction with human subjects was necessary as the data had already been collected, is maintained, and is made publicly available by the CDC. Exempt IRB status was requeste d and granted by the Boise State University Office of Research Compliance (IRB Protocol Number: 028 -SB17 -070). Data Cleaning and Recoding This study examined learning bias as it relates to CAM. Since only a portion of all NHIS participants were chosen to p articipate in the ALT supplement, only those adults who participated in the supplement were used in this study. Participants who used CAM identified a first, second, and third top therapy; q uestions about CAM were asked in terms of those therap ies (e.g., told personal health care provider about use of first top therapy , used second top ther apy for specific health problem) . I used the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) to 28 merge data from the NHIS 201 2 ALT supplement with demographic and general health information from the Household, Family Core and Sample Adult components. This produced a sample of n=34,525 adults aged 18 and over who answered 782 supplemental questions on CAM in addition to the stand ard questions from the Household, Family Core, Sample Adult components. Once the data was merged, time was taken to ensure a complete data set. Thi s required that I examine the data for inconsistencies as well as make decisions about incomplete data and da ta cleaning. I deleted all cases in which a proxy adult answered questions for individual s unable to answer for themselves ; this left 33, 413 cases remaining . I also needed to decide which of the 872 available questions pertained to this study and should b e used in my analyses. Besides keeping basic demographic information, I was guided by my research question and the general paradigm of learning bias in determining data to include in the final subset. After recoding and cleaning the data, I had a subset of n=9991 adults with 27 variables. See Appendix B: Cleaning Recording of NHIS Data for the procedures , which ensures that my analysis can be replicated. After the cleaning and recoding was complete, I had five questions remaining about CAM use (see Table 3 .1) and 11 top therapies (see Table B.1) . One question was whether the top therapy was chosen because it was part of the respondent's upbringing. Table 3.1 Variables for Use as Proxies for Learning Biases 29 The other four questions related to whether a the rapy was chosen because it was recommended by a particular person. While cleaning the data I decided that I would use \"Used/saw practitioner for top therapy because it was part of your upbringing\" as a proxy for content bias. To review, content bias involv es people acquiring information through social learning, which then acts as a contextual cue or mental template. One way an individual can acquire a \"template\" is through the information they acquire as they are growing up, i.e., their upbringing. Informa tion acquired from family, friends, and co -workers could be classified as conformist bias, but family could arguably also be considered as proxy for content bias. Similarly, friends and co -workers could alternately be considered skill or success based bias depending on context. Information acquired from a medical doctor could be classed prestige, success, or skill -based bias. Thus, attaching a specific bias type to each source of information influencing CAM use was not possible. However , irrespective of specific bias type, the questions are still proxies for general learning bias. It is important to note that the five questions were not merged in the cleaning and recoding process because all, one, some, or none of the questions could be answered affirmativel y by the same participant. Therefore, I decided to keep these five questions separate in my analysis and determine which specific bias they represented in my final interpretation. Descriptive Statistics I used 1 0 variables for descriptive statistics. Besid es standard demographics like age, race, sex, marital status, education, and income, I also chose other variables from the NHIS survey such as family size, number of children in the household, and the number of 30 elderly family members living in the househol d. I thought these additional variables might be of interest and give a more detailed identification o f CAM users (see Table 3.2). Table 3.2 Additional Variables Chosen for Descriptive Statistics Definitions of Therapy Types Naturopathy - An umbrella term for natural therapies using natural products. Other Exercise - Exercise techniques such as Pilates, Feldenkrais, Alexande r Technique, Trager Psychophysical Integration, etc. Healers - The use of traditional healers like Native American Healers, Medicine Men, Shamans, Hueseros, Yerberos, etc. Acupuncture - The use of needles to alleviate pain and treat medical conditions. Hom eopathy -Miniscule doses of natural substances that in a healthy person would produce symptoms of a disease are used to treat an existing disease. Diets -The Akins Diet, Vegan, Vegetarian, or other specialized diets for health reasons. Mind -Body -A wide ra nge of mind -body therapies such as hypnosis, hio-feedback, mantra meditation, mindfulness meditation , spiritual meditation , guided imagery , progressive relaxation , etc. , used for general health and to treat medical conditions. 31 M-B Exercise - Mind -body exer cise techniques such as Tai Chi, Qi Gong, Yoga, etc. used for health reasons. Massage - The manipulation of the muscles and tissues of the human body, includ ing craniosacral massage. Chiropractic - The manipulation of the joints and spine, includ ing osteop athy. Herbal - Non- vitamin herbal remedies used for medical conditions and general health. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). I used chi -square h ypothesis tests of independence to compare eleven different CAM therapies with five questions about use . Because I was interested in patterns and relationships between categorical data and all assumptions of independence , and expected counts were met, chi-square was my best choice (Field 2013). This resulted in 55 separate 2 x 2 contingency tables with a corresponding significance level (p -value) . Only 2 x 2 contingency tables were generated, so the Pearson's Chi -square test statistic was used with Odds Ratio (OR) to determine effect size (Field 2013; Kim 2017) . Because of the number of tests ( 55), I decided to print the contingency tables in the appendices and only present the Chi -square statistics and odds ratios in five short summary tables (organized by the previously discussed five questions) in the body of thesis. This allows interested readers access to contingency tables with expected counts, percentages, and standardized adjusted residuals without flooding the body of the text with page after page of tables. 32 Qualitative Analysis: Contextual Inquiry Data Source I used semi -structured interviews to obtain information about the context of use. Participants were first asked a set of standard questions and then as the interview continued , additional que stions were posed to clarify or expand on the original. This allowed a greater in-depth contextual understanding of how and why participants interpreted and percei ved their actions and decisions: \"Qualitative study is an inquiry process of understanding a social or human problem, based on a complex, holistic picture, formed with words, reporting detailed views of informants, and conducted in a natural setting\" (Creswell 2009). Recruitment Flyers were posted in public areas where CAM users congregate (publi c boards at health food stores). Twelve individuals were recruited through social networks, word of mouth, an d other participant s' referrals . When I first began recruiting informants for interviews, I contacted three individuals whom I knew through past conversations to be CAM users. After being interviewed, these informants were asked if they would be willing to give my contact information to other CAM users. These informants were not paid and their help in recruitment was voluntary . This is a variation of both the snowball and respondent -driven sampling methods (Bernard 2011, 147 -149). In snowball sampling, the informant gives the interviewer a list of other potential informants, and tho se new informants in turn list even more potential informants, thus creating a \"snowball\" effect . In respondent -driven sampling, one or a few key informants are generally paid for being interviewed and are then asked to recruit up to three others. 33 Eight interviews were conducted in the privacy of the informants' homes at th eir request (they were given a choice between a public location of their choice within the Boise area or their home). One informant insisted on being interviewed at a pub during a social gathering . This unexpected request resulted in an active conversation and concurrent semi -structured interviews with three other informants. Utilizing the social networks available resulted in a total of n=12 informants participating in the semi - structured interviews. Safety of Human Subjects Careful consideration was given to approval of methods regarding human subjects. Interviewing for the qualitative data collection began in December 2017 and continued until February 2018. Approval for the study was received from the Boise State University Office of Research Compliance b efore administration to the public occurred (IRB Protocol Number: 028SB17209). All subjects gave verbal informed consent in the research. See Appendix C Human Subject Protocols for all materials relating to the approval process. Organization and Analysis of Findings Data collected from the interviews was organized and coded by topics, issues, similarities, and differences. Once I had coded topics, I used a thematic analysis because I wanted to understand how a participant experienced the process of decidi ng to use CAM , and I wanted to try to see the experience from that person's perspective (Miller and Brewer 200 3; Sutton and Austin 2015) . This type of research \"has 2 basic tenets: first, that it is rooted in phenomenology, attempting to understand the mea ning that individuals ascribe to their lived experiences, and second, that the researcher must 34 attempt to interpret this meaning in the context of the research\" (Sutton and Austin 2015, 228). I looked for commonalities and difference s in statements informa nts made and then organized these by semantic themes (see Figure 3.2) . Figure 3.2 Themes Once the data was organized by theme, I compared the findings to the results from the qualitative analyses and the broader picture of the learning bias framework. I used paraphrased excerpts of the informants' statements as examples to underscore particular points. Delimitations and Limitations Delimitations - Factors That Were Controlled by the R esearcher First, I acknowledge that more sophisticated tests may have b een performed for both quantative and qualitative analyses. However, I used tests and comparisons that I was experienced in using and underst ood how to interpret. Secondly, self-reporting in the interviews may have resulted in over - or under -estimates. The participants were asked to 35 recall distant events and so there may have been some recall bias, although I have no reason to suspect this. Limitations - Factors T hat Were Not Under the Control of the R esearcher I acknowledge several study limitations. Firs t, the data from the NHIS looked at only the most common CAM therapies. Second, inferences about causality depend on individuals' accurate assessments of their own decision -making processes. However, in general, it seems reasonable to judge that most parti cipants believed they used CAM for the reasons they provided. Data were self -reported and recall error is a possibility. However, the recall period was limited to the previous 12 months, which was likely to limit bias. Lastly, obviously, this study makes n o claims about the efficacy of any CAM therapy. The data I used for my study did not permit an analysis of efficacy. 36 CHAPTER FOUR: RESULTS Descriptive statistics were created and statistical analyses conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) . I deleted all records outside the domain of interest (CAM users) in order to work with a smaller data file and facilitate faster processing time. However, NHCHS warns that running complex sample analyses for subsetted datasets may yield unreliable estimates and that \"in general, software packages that correctly analyze complex survey data cannot compute accurate standard errors for subsetted data\" (NCHS 2012; NCHS 2016,6). My CAM users (n=9991). Observing the NCHS warning, I decided that I would not use complex sample analyses but rather run all analyses on the unweighted data . Descriptive Statistics Based on the 2012 N HIS data, females were reported to use CAM at a hi gher ratio (61.7%) than male s (38.3%). This compar es with only a slight difference between female (53.3%) and male (46.7% ) non -CAM users (see Figure 4.1 ). For Marital Status, 44.6% are married with the spouse in the household, 22.5% have never been married , and 15.2% are divorced, while only 5.9% and 2.3% are either living with a pa rtner or separated respectively (see Figure D.3). CAM users who self -identify as White (78.8 %) outnumber all other races combined (see Figure D.4). 37 Graph 4.1 Sex Ratio of CA M vs. Non -CAM Users Graph 4.2 Education Level of CAM vs. Non -CAM Users Most CAM users are between the ages o f 34 and 61 . They are also well -educated. 44.6% had a college degree, 21.3 % had at least some college , and another 19% either graduated from high school or obtained a GED, whereas only 4.6% dropped from high school (see Figure 4.2) . Most either live by themselves (36.4%) or with only one other person (33.4%), while another 27.9% live with 2 - 4 others. Very few CAM users have 38 children (73.8%) , where as the ones who do have children usually have only 1 -3 (24.7%). Less than 2% had four or more children , but 77% reported that someone over the age of 65 lived with them (see Appendix D) . These statistics seem to indicate that the majority of CAM users are not using CAM because they cannot afford it or because of the lack of education . They are white educated individuals with small families who have either an older partner or a parent living with them . These results are supported by previous studies on the characteristics of CAM users (Ernst 2000; Tait et al. 2013; Institute of Medicine 2005). Chi-Square Analyses Statistical analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, US A). All data I used from the NHIS to test my hypotheses were categorical and each test examined the relationship between two variables. Therefore, I used Pearson's chi -square test of independence with 2 x 2 contingency tables to assess if the proportion ch oosing CAM varies based on type of learning bias. For example, are those using homeopathy (compared to not) more likely to have learned about it when growing up? Adjusted standardized residuals and odds ratios were used to determine directionality and effe ct size (Field 2013; McHugh 2013). Because I conducted 55 analyses, contingency tables for significant results are listed in Appendix E ; non -significant results are not listed. Figure 4. 3 is a summary graph displaying the learning bias percentage per top therapy used. 39 Graph 4.3 Learning Bias Percentage for Each Top Therapy 40 Used Top Therapy Because it was Part of Your Upbringing Results from the Chi -square tests indicated there was no significant relationship between Upbringing and Naturopathy, or Upbrin ging and Acupuncture. However, the relationship between Upbringing and the use of Traditional Healers was highly significant and based on the odds ratio CAM users were 9 times more likely to use a Traditional Healer if it was part of their upbringing, 2(1) = 179.51, p < .001, (OR 9.03). Significant results were also found for Homeopathy , which was 2.7 times more likely to be used if it was part of upbringing , 2(1) = 40.6, p < .001, (OR 2.73). Table 4. 1 shows that Special Diets, Mind -Body Therapy, and Othe r Exercises were also more likely to be used if they were part of upbringing . Mind -Body Exercise, Massage, Chiropractic, and Herbal Remedies also indicated a significant relationship with upbringing. However, for those therapies, the odds ratios indicated that if the top therapy was part of their upbringing, that therapy is less likely to be Mind -Body Exercise, Massage, Chiropractic, or Herbal Remedies . Table 4. 1 Chi-Square and Odds Ratios for Upbringing Therapy X2p-value Odds Top Therapy Because it was Recommend ed by a Medical Doctor The Chi -square tests indicated that if the top therapy were recommended by a medical doctor , that therapy is less likely to be Naturopathy, Traditional Healers, Mind - Body Exercises, Homeopathy, Mind -Body Therapy, or Chiropractic. How ever, results indicated that Special Diets are 1.30 times more likely to be used if recommended by a medical doctor , 2(1) = 4.88, p =.03, (OR 1.30); and Herbal Supplements are 2.47 times more likely to be used, 2(1) = 328.21, p <.001, (OR 2.47). Acupunct ure, Other Exercise, and Massage were non -significant. See Table 4. 2. Table 4. 2 Chi-Square and Odds Ratios for Medical Doctor Used Top Therapy Because it was Recommended by a Family Member Naturopathy, Acupuncture, Special Diets, Mind -Body Therapy, Mas sage, and Herbal Supplements had non -significant results. If the top therapy were recommended by a family member , that therapy is less likely to be Mind -Body Exercise or Other Exercise . Traditional Healers were more likely to be used, 2(1) = 28.36, p < .001, (OR 2.72), as 42 was Homeopathy, 2(1) = 7.80, p =.01, (OR 1.52), and Chiropractic, 2(1) = 7.37, p = .01, (OR 1.15). See Table 4. 3. Table 4. 3 Chi-Square and Odds Ratios for Family Member Used Top Therapy Because it was Recommended by a Friend Naturopathy, Homeopathy, Acupuncture, and Massage were all non -significant. Top therapies most likely to be used if recommended by a friend were Traditional Healers, 2(1) = 10.60, p =.001, (OR 1.28), Mind -Body Exercises, 1.99), Mind -Body -Therapy, 2(1) = 24.23, p < .001, (OR 1.45), and Other Exercises 2(1) = 5.61, p = .02, (OR 1.51) . If the top therapy were recommended by a family member, that therapy is less likely to be Special Diets, Chiro practic, or Herbal Supplements. See Table 4. 4.

If the top therapy was recommended by a family member, that therapy is less likely to be Herbal Supplements . Chiropractic was 1.36 44 times more likely to be used if recommended by a co -worker, 2(1) = 16.56, p < .001, (OR 1.36). See Table 4. 5 above. Qualitative Findings - Interviews I began each i nterview by asking participant s to review a list of CAM therapies (see Figure C.4). Beginning with the first therapy they indicated they had used, I asked them to recall how they had learned about that therapy and what they thought influenced them to use it. As the interview progressed, I asked them to expand on subjects I thought might have any bearing upon social learning or influence on CAM use . See Appendi x F for a list of highlights for each participant. Upbringing Eleven out of twelve participants stated that they were open to trying CAM therapies because of exposure during childhood or as a youth. As an example, p articipant #1 stated that her grandmother used herbal and folk remedies on a constant basi s as well as prayer and faith healing. She continued ( without prompting) and stated that she believed that is why she was willing to try most CAM therapies (Participant #1 also used the most therapies, eight in t otal). Another example came from p articipant #2, who commented that she had been raised in her grandmother's home and everyone that she knew when growing up used folk medicines and herbal remedies. Participant 1 also volunteered that she used a \"particular \" herb for muscle spasms, because her grandmother had used the same herb for headaches. She also stated that her grandmother use to \"rub her\" when she was child to relieve pain and stress , and when a friend recommended craniosacral therapy , she thought it sounded like getting a \"head rub .\" 45 When asked what influence, if any, her upbringing had on her use of CAM today, she was very disdainful and stated that \"of course \" that was the reason she used CAM. The other participants had similar stories about childho od. Experiences ranged from learning about meditation from an uncle when a teenager to being introduced as a small child to a \"healthy\" vegetarian diet by a stepparent . Family One of my base line questions concerned the participant s' defin ition of the word family. During the interview s, I discovered that the concept of \"f amily\" was very subjective and that the definition changed through life. Eight participants defined family as people they live with now , and siblings, par ents, and grandparents . Nine partici pants stated they had close friends who m they considered to be family (see Appendix F) . When asked if they had responded to questions about the influence of friends upon CAM use, only one participant (#5) stated having included that friend as a \"friend ,\" but she thought of her as family. Eleven participants stated they had \"aunts and uncles\" when growing up that they discovered were not related when they were older ; they were actually friends of their parents or other adults in the home. Those same eleven participants stated that when they think of their childhood \"f amily ,\" it includes all relatives they felt \"close to ,\" adults in the household and family friends. Most respondents specifically included grandparent s. To gain more understand ing, I asked subje cts, \"What influence does your \"f amily\" (past or present) have on your choices about CAM use\". Participants responded that \"it depends\" or \"usually do\"; several times these statements succeeded one another . 46 Participant #4 provides an example, \"Well it dep ends ya know. I mean umm sure. I mean uh ... like uh yea if they said hey try t his, I'd do it. Usually. Maybe i t depends. Depends on what it is .\" \"Could you explain? I don't understand .\" \"Well like umm it depends like if they know sunt -in [something] bout it or if they dun it demself or like if you know they know its safe n stuff, ya know?\" When asked why they would follow a family member's recommendation to try a CAM therapy (or product) , all participants stated because they trusted them and \"most\" of the time they knew what they were talking about. Only two participants ( #2 and #10), stated they did it to specifically to make a family member happy (happy as in honestly wanting to please ), and two people stated they did it to make their spouse \"shut up\" or \"shut the hell up about it .\" Four people (#5 , #7, #8, and # 12) stated the same thing (shutting her up) about their mothers. Participant #6 stated he was not raised around CAM products but as he got older (adult, divorced twice, currently married and with three children), his father started taking herbal supplements and his health improved. When participant #6 started having health problems , his wife convinced him to start taking a supplement; he said he did it because it seemed to work for his dad. Friends Friends were subjectively categorized by participants as \"work friends, \"normal friend ,\" \"party friends ,\" \"school friends ,\" \"old friend ,\" \"acquaintances just like organizing the separate themes , I classified \" work friend \" and \" business friend\" as \" co-47 worker s.\" Depend ing on how the participant perceived closeness of friendship, participants were either more or less likely to follow that friend's recommendation. Of specific interest was that eight participants stated they had tried a new therapy temporarily simply to please someone who m they wanted to \"become closer to .\" When asked why they did not name that therapy as one they used, the usual reply was they did not consider it as counting, they forgot about it, it was not important, it was just something they did once or twice, or because they only did it to make the other person \"happy .\" Four people stated that they had tried a therapy that a friend recommended to \"shut them up\" or get them to \"stop nagging me ,\" but then they stopped doing it after a while. When asked what their friend thought about their quitting, three people said they were not happy they quit but were happy they tried. The other participant stated the y never told them ; they just quit doing it. Co-workers All participants clearly distinguished \"friend\" from \"co-worker\" , not consider ing them to be in the same category. All except #5 and #12 stated that sometimes co-workers could become friends but \"it depended .\" Answers were vague and participants did not seem to know how to explain how a person 's co-worker becomes a friend . However, the consensus seemed that such a change was based on trust levels and similar interests and/or goals. Participant #1 said s he married her co-worker after they became friends. So now, they \"were family and not a friend any more .\" Number 12 made it clear he did not consider a boss to be a co -worker. He also stated that he had done Tai Chi for a while to make his boss happy but that it did not 48 count because he \"just did it so I'd get a raise. But I didn't get it and then he went somewhere else and so I quit doing it .\" Participants #1, #2, #3, #4, that they wouldn't try something that was risky based on a co -worker's recommendation unless other information was available . Degree of Friendship, Risk Perception, Skill/Knowledge and Trust These categories all act as qualifiers. Regardless of upbringing or who recommended a CAM therapy , the participants al l used one of these qualifiers to judge the quality of information. As stated earlier, participants would not try something potentially risky or harmful as a co-worker suggested, but as levels of trust and perception of skill/knowledge increased , they were more likely to follow recommendations. Medical Doctors All the participants originally told me they trusted their doctor's opinion , but all participants also stated in varying degrees later on in the interview that doctors couldn't be trusted for a variet y of reasons, including the \"doctor is in it for the money ,\" \"it's all about the money ,\" \"they don't really care ,\" \"I'm just a number to them ,\" and \" they only listen to me cause I have good insurance \". Participant #1 described trying a diet supplement beca use the doctor said it would help. She also stated that it did not help and she would not try anything else like it suggested in the future. When asked about talking to the doctor about that, the reply was no. When asked why , she said , \"Oh, hell, he don't care. He got my money. Beside s, he don't got time. Why bother ? I'll just ask someone next time or look it up myself. There is always the internet .\" 49 Participants #2, #4, #7, #9, #11, and #12 all stated they would trust their doctor's recommendation on di ets and herbs , because , as participant #12 stated ,\"they know if it 's going to kill me or not\". 50 CHAPTER FIVE: DISCUSSION Summary and Conclusion The main object of this study was to determine if there is a relationship between CAM use and social learning . The chi -square analyses revealed that learning bias and CAM use were, in some way, related to each other. Whe n examining chi -square results, one sees that out of 55 tests performed, 26 had significant results. However, significance alone shows only that a relationship exists. I also needed to know effect size and directionality. I used the odds ratio (OR) rather than Cramer's V to determine effect size because relatively weak effects are all that can be expected when the outcome is only partially dependen t on the independent variable (McHugh 2013). Preliminary tests using Cramer's V showed that very small numbers were in fact returned, suggesting that the use of CAM was only partially dependent on learning bias. Since the goal of this study was only to det ermine the existence of a relationship and not to establish causation, the odds ratio gave a much clearer picture of both effect size and directionality (more or less likely). I can only speculate at this juncture about other variables that may be influenc ing CAM use, although previous studies have suggested that medical conditions and world view may be other influencing factors (Astin 1998; Barnes, Bloom, and Nahin 2007; Baer 2003; Clarke et al. 2015). In testing my second hypothesis (people differentially using information dependent on the type of CAM therapy), I looked at upbringing as a proxy for content bias and delayed assigning proxy status to the other variables (family, friends, co -51 workers, medical doctor). When looking at the relationship between u pbringing and the different CAM therapies , we see that most of the relationships are significant but directionality is mixed . For four therapies , the odds ratios indicated that if a top therapy were part of a person's upbringing, it is less likely that the rapy is Mind -Body Exercise, Massage, Chiropractic, or Herbal Supplements . However, for five other therapies (Traditional Healers, Homeopathy, Special Diets, Mind -Body Exercise, and Other Movement/ Exercise Techniques) , it was more likely that a person woul d use that CAM therapy if it was part of a person's upbringing . Reviewing those treatments that were more likely to be be used if they were part of a person's upbringing, we see that the use of Traditional Healers, such as a Shaman or Medicine Man, was nine times more likely. In support of the statistical relationship, two participants in my interviews indicated that they had used a Traditional Healer because they were raised with an acceptance of that type of treatment. For those whose top therapy was Mind-Body therapy ( e.g., bio-feedback, hypnosis, energy healing, etc.), they were more likely to say it was part of their upbringing (30%) than those whose top therapy was something else (only 10%) . Here again, interviewees indicated they had used the therapy (hypnosis) because they knew someone as they grew up who had been hypnotized. Homeopathy is a treatment in which a person is treated for a disease or condition with a minute amount of a natural substance that create s the symptoms similar to those of the d isease , based on the idea that \"like cures like .\" The analysis indicated that if the top therapy were part of upbringing , people were almost three (OR2.73) times as likely to state that it was Homeopathy . 52 People who stated that their top therapy was part of their upbringing were almost twice (OR1.91) as likely to state that it was Special Diets . The findings from my interviews support the statistical results wherein one interviewee stated that he was a vegetarian because his family didn't eat meat when he was a child. Other Exercise and Movement Techniques include Pilates, a popular exercise regime that can be done at home. Other Exercise had an almost even (OR1.19) odds ratio, suggesting that the likelihood of its being reported as part of their upbringing (20%) was the same as the average of all other categories combined. Content bias is experience -driven . Once a person is exposed to a particular concept, skill, idea, or behavior , then that person has a template against which they can judge similar informa tion. It presupposes that exposure to or acceptance of information in the past will influence the decision to preferentially accept similar information in the future. Therefore , the literature on content bias is focused primarily on positive associations b etween learning bias and information acquisition or preferences for certain information, skills or behavior (Henrich and Smith et al. 2008). I think that using upbringing as a proxy for content bias influencing CAM choice is appropriate because it presupposes that being introduced to CAM when growing up will influence the decision to use certain CAM therapies later in life. Interview findings suggest that upbringing does in fact create a mental model in which the acceptance and use of CAM during childhood becomes the norm and thus when reaching adulthood makes it more likely that the person will use CAM again. 53 Using CAM therapy because a medical doctor rec ommended it could potentially fall under one of several bias categories success, prestige, or skill/knowledge. These are all model -based biases and technically, as long as evidence supports the existence of a relationship , my hypothesis is supported. How ever, I also wanted to know which specific bias were in play. Before the statistical tests were run and before I performed the interviews, I was ambivalent about which category Medical Doctor would fall under. If people were making success -biased decisions , then people would most likely be following their doctor's recommendations because they view their doctor as successful (going to medical school is hard but he /she made it through and doctors make a lot of money so he /she must be successful.) On the othe r hand, they may perceive that being a doctor is prestigious, i.e., a person perceives that doctors are important people. Because they see doctor s as being important ( prestige -bias), they are more likely to follow his /her recommendations. Last is skill-based bias. The statistical analyses indicated that highly significant relationships exist among all but three of the therapies and a doctor recommend ing that therapy. Only two therapies with significant results had positive effects: Special Diets, which were almost one and a half (OR1.30) times more likely to be used, and Herbal Supplements, which were nearly two and a half (OR2.43) times more likely. The interviews I conducted helped shed some light on this. These two therapies in particular could potential ly cause harm, sickness, or death; they have potential of bad side effects; they can negatively affect current health conditions; they can have serious negative interactions with other medications; and in the case of supplements, they can even cause death if taken incorrectly. People expected their doctor s to know about these 54 potential issues and to tell them. In other words , the interviews indicated that using a therapy based on a medical doctor 's recommendation was knowledge -based (skill -based). Family, friends, and co -workers were also classifications about which I was ambivalent as to type of bias represented, but they were not as easy to categorize. Conformist bias (a frequency dependent bias) predicts that individuals are disproportionally more likely to imitate the most common behavior (Boyd and Richerson 1982). Unlike frequency dependent bias , which relates to the commonality of a behavior or idea, model -based biases relate to from whom (i.e., the model) we acquire a behavior or idea. The results of the statistical analyses did not c larify which bias was in play, it only indicated that a relationship existed. Among top therapies used because they were recommended by a family member, four therapies showed positive significant relationship s: Traditiona l Healers, which were over two and half (OR2.72) times more likely to be the top therapy; Homeopathy, one and half (OR1.52) times ; and Acupuncture (OR1 .22) or Chiropractic (OR1.15) with only slightly above even odds . These figures only show the strength of the relationship ; they do not supply any information about which biases may be in play. Similarly, w hen participants state that the top therapy were recommend ed by a friend ther e is slightly above even odds that Traditio nal H ealers (OR1.28) were the top therapy; Mind -Body Exercise (OR 1.99) were about twice as likely ; and Mind -Body Therapy (OR 1.45) or Other Exercises ( 1.51) were abou t one and half times more likely . The c o-worker category only had two therapies with significant relationships , of which only Chiropractic (OR 1.36) were more likely to be the top therapy selected . 55 The statistical analyses therefore only indicate that significant relationships do exist between CAM use and s ocial learning. While this does support my first hypothesis that biased social learning influenc es people's decisions to use CAM, it does not entirely address my second hypothesis that people are differentially using information depend ing on the type of CAM therapy ( i.e., different learning biases are being used). This is because the NHIS data does not give a good depiction of the specific biases are in play . The interviews I conducted help ed more than the analysis for understanding which biases may be operating . No participants indicated that their use of CAM was related to how commonly or often others used CAM . Rather, very specific reasons were given for use of CAM , all relating to relationship with other people (who that person was), that person's level of perceived trustworthiness and knowledge, and the degree of risk invo lved. Doctors, for example, were deemed very knowledgeable and initially were reported as being trustworthy, but further in depth probing revealed an underlying distrust in the medical industry as a whole, and skepticism about medical practitioners in general. This suggests that risk and trust may be additional factors that have to be taken into account in any future studies. Co-workers f ared worse than did medical doctors . The majority of participants saw co -workers as having the potentiality of being tr ustworthy but not necessarily to the extent of their being trusted on health related topics. The exception was that when a co- worker suggested a top therapy, Chiropractic was more likely to be that top therapy . I speculate that this may be due to the conte xt of shared environment and commonality. For this reason, I would argue that co-workers may be representing similarity bias but that a more in -depth study is necessary to determine if that is the only factor in play. 56 Friend's recommendations about CAM were usually followed if related to exercise or if it was already part of the participants' mental template as formed in their upbringing. Interviews indicated that friend s' advice was likely to be followed if they had personal knowledge, experience, or s kill in the use of the therapy being recommended. For this reason, \"recommended by f riend \" could be put in the category of skill -based bias. However, it was also reported that participants used CAM therapies based on a friend's recommendations because they wer e conforming (making their friend \"happy\"). Recommendations from family members were the most difficult category to classify. Not only were people's definitions of family subjective but also time -dependent (family defined as a child vs . family defined as an adult) . If a person followed a recommendation from a family member that was part of their upbringing, this would be content bias. On the other hand, if followed because of knowledge or skill , then the choice would be classified as a skill -based bias. On ce again, looking at the findings of the interviews , I perceived that interviewees stated that in most cases they followed family recommendations because such a recommendation was similar to CAM use they had been introduced to as children . The exceptions occurred when a family member had direct knowledge or experience about a CAM therapy, in which case the interviewee would try the therapy because of trust in the family member. Because I cannot determine motivation or circumstance from the statistical data, I am unable to separate which bias is occurring , content or conte xt. Therefore, I am categorizing family r ecommendations as a general learning bias. Overall, I think that except for upbringing, which does seem a good fit for c ontent bias, the other catego ries cannot be definitively categorized into specific learning biases but rather as general context bias es. 57 Subsequently, I have evidence, both contextual and statistical, that learning biases do in fact have some positive influence on the use of CAM. I ha ve not addressed however, results that show a significant relationship but negative effect (OR < 1.00) . When looking at Table 5.1, one can see that there seems to be an apparent pattern: when a top therapy is chosen , it is more likely to be stated to be be cause of one reason, and less likely to be stated it was chosen because it was of another (or it has no relationship at all). For example, if someone uses a top therapy because of a doctor's recommendation, that selection is more likely to be Special Diets or Herbal Supplements and less likely to be that of Healers. This is an inherent feature of the structure of the data. It reveals when proportions are higher or lower than average, so if some categories are high, others must be low. Table 5.1 Positive an d Negative Effects of the CAM -Bias Relationship As I mentioned previously , interviewees stated they perceived some therapies had higher risk factors than others, which in turn influenced who m they were most likely to listen , based on skill or knowledge . I speculate that social learning biases are influencing 58 the use of CAM but that the rela tionship is being moderated by a third variable. Moderation occurs when the interaction of a third variable affects the strength or directionality of the relationship bet ween two variables (Field 2013) . Figure 5.1 Moderator E ffect I could not test post hoc for moderation because the data set from the NHIS do es not provide the necessary variables to perform the tests ; future studies should explore those possibilities. However, regardless of whether or not moderation explains effect size and direction of the relationships, significant relationships do exist. As I stated earlier, numerous studies on the relationships between the use of CAM and subjects such as chronic pain, illness, philosophical worldviews, and demographics have been conducted (Barnes, Bloom, and Nahin 2007; Berman, 2003; Owen, Lewith, and Stephens 2001). However, there have been no theoretically informed explanations . My study used the theoretical framework of social learning biases to perform empirical tests to examine how people are deciding to use CAM. This approach had a two -fold value, in as an emphasis on modeling over empirical inquiry has been an area of criticism (Gibson and Lawson 2014) . My goal was to perform a pilot study to determine if enough evidence existed to 59 support i n-depth future studies on the relationship between learning biases and CAM use. I think that my hypotheses are supported : social learning biases are influencing people's decisions to use C AM; and people are differentially using informatio n depending on the therapy used; and that future studies should examine this relationship more closely. Future Direction As I have mentioned , possible moderator effects may be occurring. I would suggest that future studies keep this in mind and look for potential moderating variables like ri sk, trust levels , and social and environmental factors . I would also suggest combin ing both qualitative and contextual inquiry because , as my study indicated, purely statistical information does not always address the underlying questions . Additionally, future empirical testing of the relationship betwe en learning biases and decision -making in regard to human health should be actively pursued. There are many questions about the decisions that people make regarding their health but the focu s has been mainly on proximate explanations , or modalities and demographics , and like the research conducted on CAM, most of that research has no real theoretical underpinning. Another possible area of study is examin ing whether the use of CAM , and the learning biases influencing that use, is adaptive. In other words, are people who are using CAM surviving and reproducing at a higher rate than people who are not? This too should be examined in context; previous studies have shown correlations between chroni c health issues and CAM use (Moore et al. 1985; Thomson et al. 2014; Institute of Medicine 2005). Are people with these health issues surviving and reproducing at higher rates than people who have the same health issues and do not use CAM? This question may be especially pertinent for those individuals who do not use CAM as an alternative 60 to modern medicine but rather as a complement. This question has far-reaching potential impact, as it would substantiate the claims that CAM users themselves have been mak ing for quite some time (U.S. Senate 1998; Kantor 2009). 61 REFERENCES Acerbi, Alberto, and R.

Their efficacy in major depressive disor der, however, has not been conclusively demonstrated. Objective To test the efficacy and safety of a well -characterized H perforatum ex-tract (LI-160) in major depressive disorder. Design and Setting Double -blind, rando mized, placebo -controlled trial con -ducted in 12 academic and community psychiatric research clinics in the United States. Participants Adult outpatients (n=340) recruited between December 1998 and June 2000 with major depression and a baseline total scor e on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM - D) of at least 20. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to receive H perforatum , placebo, or sertraline (as an active comparator) for 8 weeks. Based on clinical response, the daily dose of H perforatum could range from 900 to 1500 mg and that of sertraline from 50 to 100 mg. Responders at week 8 could continue blinded treatment for another 18 weeks. Main Outcome Measures Change in the HAM -D total score from baseline to 8 weeks; rates of full response, deter mined by the H AM-D and Clinical Global Impres sions (CGI) scores. Results On the 2 primary outcome measures, neither sertraline nor H perforatum was significantly different from placebo. The random regression parameter estimate for mean (SE) change in HAM -D total score from baseline to week 8 (with a greater decline indicating more improvement) was -9.20 (0.67) (95% confidence interval P= .18). Full response occurred in 31.9% of the placebo -treated patients vs 23.9% of the perforatum P=.26). Sertraline was better than placebo on the CGI improvement scale ( P= .02), which was a secondary measure in this study. Adverse -effect profiles for H perforatum and ser traline differed relative to placebo. Conclusion This study fails to support the efficacy of H perforatum in moderately severe major depression. The result may be due to low assay sensitivity of the trial, but the complete absence of trends suggestive of efficacy for H perforatum is no teworthy (Hypericum Depression Trial 2002,1807). 72 APPENDIX B Cleaning and Recoding of NHIS Data 73 Choosing variables For Familyxx.sav (126 questions, n=43345) Clear All Variables except HHX Household Number FMX Family Number FM_SIZE Size of family FM_KIDS # family members under 18 years of age FM_ELDER # family members aged 65 and older INCGRP3 Total combined family income (grouped) HOUSEOWN Home tenure status Save As Family_edited.sav For personsx.sav (602 questions, n=108131) Clear All Variables Household FMX Family Number FPX Person Number (Within family) EDUC1 Highest level of school completed Save As Person_edited.sav For samadult.sav (808 questions, N=34525) Clear FMX Family Number FPX Person Number SEX MRACBPI2 Race coded to single/mul tiple race group AGE_P Age R_MARITL Marital Status PROXYSA Sample adult status Save As Samadult_edited.sav For althealth.sav (782 questions, N=34525) Clear All Variables FPX Person Number (Within famil y) First of top 3 most important therapies TP1_RS9 Used/saw practitioner for first top therapy because: it was part of your upbringing TP1_REC1 Used/saw practitioner for first top therapy because it was recommended by: a medical doctor 74 TP1_REC2 Used/saw practitioner for first top therapy because it was recommended by: a family member TP1_REC3 Used/saw practitioner for first top therapy because it was recommended by: a friend TP1_REC4 Used/saw practitioner for first top therapy because it was recomm ended by: a co -worker Save As Althhealth_edit1.sav 75 Merging files and removing unnecessary variables For Family_edited.sav Family_edited.sav into to Person_edited.sav one key variable : FAM_RCD For Person_edited.sav into Samadult_edited.sav Merge Samadult_edited into Althealt h_edit1 Delete all cases where physical or mental condition prohibits response or status is unknown.
