A slang way of saying that something has disappeared and is gone. A-body. This is sort of backwoods-Pennsylvania shorthand for \"anybody.\" My mother would often mutter how hard it was for a-body to do this or that in the big city of Cleveland. Abdication. A resignation or renunciation of power. The word is most often used to describe the decision by a reigning monarch to voluntarily relinquish a throne. Abhorrent. Disgusting. Loathsome. Above the Fray. One who stays above the fray remains cool and collected in the midst of turmoil. A \"fray\" is a fight that goes on and on. Some sources date the term to feudal times, when nobles, high in their castles, remained serenely unaffected by the squabbles of their vassals outside the gates below. When I hear the phrase, I think of Confederate commander Robert E. Lee, watching the fierce fighting from atop a Fredericksburg, Virginia, hill in the U.S. Civil War. Lee is said to have remarked to Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, \"It is well that war is so terrible, [lest] we should grow too fond of it.\" Abscond. To run away quickly, usually with someone or something. Escaping prisoners are absconding, but they are really absconding if they take, say, the jailer's keys with them. Accolade. An expression of admiration. Praise. Accolades can also have a tangible component. Awards are accolades. Accouterments. From the French, as you might have guessed, this word describes the trappings or accessories that go with uniforms or dress. Ad nauseam. To a sickening degree. There's a direct relationship between something that goes on and on, ad nauseam, and nausea. Admonishment. A stern, often verbal, rebuke or criticism. Admonition. A gentle warning or piece of advice. AGKWE. Texting shorthand for \"And God knows what else.\" Ague. A malaria-like infectious disease spread by parasites, often in dirty water. Symptoms include high fever and severe chills. Alacrity. Quickness or eagerness. Someone who is offered the last remaining ticket to a sold-out concert would be wise to accept it with alacrity. Algorithm. A step-by-step mathematical procedure that involves a common factor called a \"divisor.\" Algorithms can be used to find commonalities in non-mathematical situations as well. Alkali. A harsh mixture of soluble salts, often found in arid regions, that makes land unsuitable for agriculture. All\u00e9e. An alley in a garden or park, formed by processions of trees on each side. Allegorical. Relating to an allegory, or metaphorical story or saying. The saying \"Where there's smoke, there's fire,\" for instance, isn't about fire at all. Alliteration. The repetition of the first letters, especially consonants, in a string of words, often done deliberately for effect. One of the best-known examples is \"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.\" Amalgamation. A combination of two or more elements. The term is sometimes applied in business to the merger of companies. Anemone. Sea anemone \u2014 pronounced uh-NEMM-ih-nee \u2014 are fairly stationary, often quite colorful, sea predators that dwell on the ocean floor. Some look like plants, whose waving \"leaves\" reach out and grab prey. Animatronic. Featuring animation by robotic creatures to mimic the movement of animals. Animus. Hatred bordering on active hostility. Wishing ill will on another. Anomaly. Something abnormal or out of the ordinary. Antebellum. Belonging to a period prior to a war. \"Ante\" means \"before.\" \"Antebellum\" is most often used to describe homes, particularly fine ones, built in the early 19th century, before the U.S. Civil War. Curiously, while there is a rarely used word \"post-bellum,\" meaning after a war, there is no word \"bellum\" itself! Anthropomorphic. Giving human-like characteristics, even including human speech, to animals or inanimate objects such as trees. Aplomb. Self-confidence and assurance. Apogee. Informally, the word is used to mean the high point of something. Technically, it's the point at which a moon or artificial satellite is at the most distant point in its orbit from the earth's center. Apprehension. Dread, fear or anticipation of dire trouble ahead. Approbation. Warm congratulations and approval, especially from an official source such as your boss. Praise is nice. Approbation can mean a raise! Archetypal. Something or someone that is the recognized example, or symbol, of a genre or motif. The Empire State Building in New York, for instance, is the archetypal skyscraper. Arrears. Behind in making payments. The word is usually coupled with \"in,\" as when the rent is \"in arrears.\" Artifice. A clever or cunning trick. Atrocity. An act that is especially cruel, wicked, tasteless, or unforgivable. Audacity. Daring, of the kind where you find yourself saying, \"Of all the nerve!\" Augur. To portend, or bode, something good or bad. The fact that someone does not return your phone calls, for instance, does not augur well for your relationship. Auld lang syne. Literally from Old English, this term means \"the old long ago.\" It was popularized in a poem by the Scot Robert Burns and, especially, by a melancholy tune sung at New Year's Eve, whose words go, in part, \"We'll take a cup o' kindness yet/ for auld lang syne.\" Avatar. Lots of young people know this word well. Online, it stands for a computer representation of oneself - an alter ego that looks and acts much like a human. The word traces to Hindu mythology, in which a god comes to earth in human form. Avocation. A hobby or secondary occupation, usually undertaken for fun rather than income. B Bacchanal. Drunken revelry. The name comes from Bacchus, the Roman god of wine and the wine harvest. Back 40. Rural parcels in America were often 40 acres [16 hectares] in size. The \"back 40\" was an uncultivated plot behind the house and plowed fields. Bagatelle. A small, unimportant thing or trifle. The name comes from the French, from the word for a short, lighthearted piece of music. Balustrade. A stairway handrail and the posts that support it. Bandana. A large, brightly colored (often red) handkerchief, often carried by trainmen and other laborers. Bassinet. A basket, often hooded and on wheels, used as a baby's bed. Bayou. A sluggish stream feeding or fed by nearby swamps, particularly in U.S. Gulf Coast states. BB gun. An air gun, or one that fires small, round, metal projectiles called BBs using a spring. It's sometimes said that \"BB\" was taken from industrial \"ball bearing\" pellets, but it actually originated from the size of lead shot used in some shotguns - BB was in between the B and BBB sizes. A number of companies have developed less-dangerous toy alternatives that employ plastic pellets. Beau ideal. A person who represents the highest standard. An exemplar or role model. Bedraggled. Soiled, unkempt, dilapidated. Beget. To produce children. Biblical references such as \"Abraham begot Isaac\" are examples. Begs the question. This phrase, often misused, means that a statement that has just been made requires proof or further explanation. One is left begging for more information. Beignet. A pastry, pronounced \"BEN-yay,\" served in New Orleans, Louisiana, and other cities of French origin. It's a square of dough that's deep-fried like a donut, then doused in powdered sugar. Belie. To misrepresent or give a false impression. Sometimes saying something that belies what's really going on is unintentional. Bellicose. Combative, quarrelsome, eager to start a fight. Belly up. One who goes \"belly up\" has been financially ruined and forced out of business. The term likely originated at sea, where dead fish float upside down and sunken ships sometimes turn hull-upward in the briny deep. The term is not to be confused with \"bellying up\" to the bar, which is thought to relate to the notion that you are old enough to drink if your belt line reaches the bar. Besotted. Intoxicated, drunk. A sot is a habitual drunkard. Big-Box Stores. These are mega-stores, sometimes an entire square block in size, that sometimes carry an entire mall's worth of products from fresh produce and meat to appliances and, in some states, even guns. Bigger than a breadbox. The meaning is clear. The term is thought to have entered popular culture thanks to American television personality Steve Allen, who was a regular panelist on the show, \"What's My Line.\" Trying to guess a line of products that the \"mystery guest\" might work with, he'd ask, \"Is it bigger than a breadbox?\" Bilious. Sour or ill-tempered. The adjective takes its name from gastric distress of the bile duct. Blacklisted. To be barred from working in one's field because of one's association with activities such as alleged affiliation with a subversive group. During the anti-Communist fervor of the Cold War, for instance, many writers, singers, and other artists were banned from performing or publishing. Blaggard. A version of \"blackguard\" \u2014 a villain, scoundrel or absolutely contemptible person.The term dates to 16th-century England, where blackguards were servants of low regard, up to no good. Blather. To talk on and on, to the point that nothing you say has any impact. Blissful. Extremely happy, quietly joyous, blithe. Blotto. Intoxicated, soused, stoned, pie-eyed, sotted, drunk as a skunk - not that we've seen too many inebriated skunks. The derivation is unclear; perhaps it popped up after one too many people were blotted out on the highway. Bloviating. Talking at excessive length, often about oneself. Bobbies. Uniformed British police. The nickname was borrowed from that of future British prime minister Robert Peel, who founded what was the first professional police force in the world in 1829. Boll weevil. A beetle with a drill-like mouth that devastated southern cotton crops until it was brought under reasonable control through the use of pesticides and traps baited with natural sexual-attractant hormones called \"pheromones.\" The \"boll\" part of the insect's name is taken from the cotton plant's seed pod. Bonhomie. Friendliness, genial good cheer. It's a quality that good-natured \"hail fellows\" (and gals) possess. The word, from the French, is pronounced \"bohn-oh-MAY.\" Boonies. A colloquial term, short for \"boondocks,\" which, in turn, refers to remote or isolated territory. Boor. A crude, uncouth, really annoying person. Boot Scootin' Boogie. A 1992 Brooks & Dunn country hit song, still popular in cowboy bars and dancehalls. Its lyrics instruct dancers to \"heel, toe, docie do,\" which takes its own explaining. Docie do, or properly do sa do, is a move, especially in squaredancing, in which the dancers turn back-to-back rather than face-to-face. Bootlegging. Making or selling illegal whiskey. The name is said to derive from an early practice of hiding a contraband bottle in one's boots. They must have been bigger boots than we wear today. Borax. A crystalline chemical containing the element boron, often extracted for use in soaps and other cleaning agents. Botch. To mess something up \u2014 carry out a plan or task carelessly or poorly. Bounty hunter. A private citizen who seeks to capture criminals in return for a bounty, or reward. Bourr\u00e9. An intensely competitive card game favored by residents of the French-speaking parishes, or counties, of Louisiana. Brass knuckles. Metal weapons molded to fit over the four fingers that face forward in a fist \u2014 all those f's in that alliteration came along by accident that were prominently featured in early movie gang fights. Brass ring. Something \u2014 often a long shot with severe odds against reaching it \u2014 that people strive for, sometimes forever and often with little success. The term goes all the way back to medieval days, when knights would try to spear a dangling ring with their lances. But more recently, brass rings were a feature of carousel rides at carnivals and county fairs. As the merry-go-round whirled, a chute barely within reach would dispense rings, one at a time. Most were iron, but one was brass. A passing rider who could snare the brass ring was awarded another ride for free. Brat. The definition of this word depends on its pronunciation. A \"braat\" is a spoiled and temperamental child. A \"brawt\" is a German bratwurst sausage. Brazier. A movable pan or stand for holding hot coals. The term was a precursor to the more familiar \"barbecue grill,\" although the fire from braziers' coals was also often used for light as well as heat. Breakfront. A china cabinet or credenza whose center section projects into the room. Brocade. A rich fabric, often of gold or silver thread, with a raised pattern. Bromide. Chemically, combining the element bromine with another such as potassium or sodium, a bromide is a compound that was once widely used (and abused) as a tranquilizing sedative. The antacid product \"Bromo-Seltzer,\" later used to relieve upset stomachs and hangovers, was a powerful formulation of bromine and sodium until bromides were ordered removed from the U.S. market in 1975. All the while, the word \"bromide\" came to be used to describe everyday, soothing clich\u00e9s. \"All's well that ends well\" is a common bromide, for example. Browbeaten. Intimidated, often by rapid-fire questions or accusations. Witnesses in court are sometimes browbeaten if the judge doesn't intervene. The origin of the word is uncertain, but it apparently began as a description of the beater, not the beaten. Specifically, the beater's \"knitted\" (frowning) eyebrows. Bruin. A bear, especially a brown bear, including a grizzly. The name is Middle English and first appeared in the fable \"The History of Reynard the Foxe,\" in which the bear character was named \"Bruin.\" Buckboard. An open, horse-drawn wagon with almost no amenities. Its driver sits in the open, on a flat, hard board, and it \"bucks\" plenty on unpaved roads. Bucket list. A list of things people want to do before they die, or \"kick the bucket.\" The term \u2014 which is often broadened to refer to any list of deeds one wants to accomplish \u2014 gained popularity with the release of a 2007 movie by that name, starring Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman as terminally ill cancer patients. Bucolic. Rustic, restful. Bumpkin. A terribly unsophisticated country person; a rube. Bungalow. A small house, usually of one story. The name derives from Hindi, in which it refers to a small house \"in the Bengali style.\" Bunk. Patently false information, akin to \"hogwash\" or bull excrement. Bunkum. Often shortened to \"bunk,\" bunkum is utter nonsense, not worthy of consideration. According to many sources, the word traces to a windy speech by a United States congressman, who, when criticized about it, replied, \"Gentlemen, I did not give this speech for you but for the people back in Buncombe County [North Carolina].\" Burley. A light-colored, relatively mild tobacco, lower in nicotine than darker varieties. Burley tobacco is grown extensively in the mid-South state of Kentucky. Not to be confused with burly, which is an adjective describing men, primarily, who are brawny and strong. Burly lumberjacks often smoke burley cigarettes. Burnish. To polish or make something smooth and shiny. People even try to burnish their images. Bushed. Exhausted. Apparently the word traces to the Dutch word for woods or wilderness, traipsing around in which is indeed tiring. Bushwhacker. Someone who attacks a wartime opponent by surprise. In old western movies, unsuspecting columns of settlers and cavalrymen were often bushwhacked by Indians or robbers. Busker. A street entertainer who solicits donations from those who watch. Bustle. This has two quite different meanings. To bustle is to move briskly. As a noun, the concept is often paired with a word with which it rhymes. We speak of the \"hustle and bustle\" of a city. But as used in my posting, a bustle was a wire frame, or a pad, or even a bow, at the back of a woman's skirt that accentuated its fullness. C Cacophony. This means a harsh or discordant note or interruption. But more broadly it has also come to refer to a really loud and disruptive clatter, as when reporters shouting questions, all at once, at a defendant emerging from a trial. Cahoots. Partnership with another. The word is usually paired with \"in.\" One is \"in cahoots\" with another, often in some sort of conspiracy. The word is borrowed from the French cahute, or \"cabin.\" It is thought to have first appeared in English among fur trappers in the American Northwest, where they often lived in \"cahoots\" with their French trapper partners. Calligraphy. Practiced and beautiful handwriting. Some people actually make a living by writing in delicate, florid longhand. Candy dancer. A laborer on a railroad work crew. The term is thought to have followed the introduction of the first track-laying machine by the Gandy Corp. of Chicago. One can picture the workers dancing out of the way of such a contraption. Capacious. Large in capacity. Capitulate. To surrender under agreed-upon terms, usually after a long and honorable struggle. Capsicum peppers. For lack of a better word, these are chili peppers. The words \"capsicum,\" \"chili,\" \"chille,\" \"chile,\" and even \"paprika\" are interchangeable when it comes to the taste of hot peppers. Cartouche. An ornamental inscription, often on a building or tomb, that looks like a scroll with rolled-up ends. Catch-22. A predicament in no option or solution really works. An example: You need a car for a certain job. But without a job, you don't have money to buy a car. The term is taken from the name of a 1961 satirical novel by Joseph Heller Catenary. If you take a string, hold an end in each hand, and let it drop freely, the string droops to form a shape called a \"catenary.\" If you could solidify the string and flip it upright, it would form a catenary arch like the Gateway Arch. Cauldron. Literally, a cauldron is a big pot, such as the one in which witches are said to boil their deadly potions. But the word has been expanded to mean a situation that is full of activity or heated emotion. Celibate. Abstaining from sexual relations, and sometimes marriage as well, often in keeping with deep religious beliefs. Chaparral. Scrubby desert land, dotted with low bushes. Charnel. Gruesomely remindful of death. A \"charnel house\" is a building or large vault in which the bodies or bones of the dead are placed. Grisly murder scenes are also sometimes described as charnel houses. Cheesy. Cheap. Poorly made. It derives from an Urdu word adapted by the British to mean showy. From there, the meaning declined even further to reflect something even more derogatory that has nothing at all to do with cheese. Chest waders. Waterproof clothing that incorporates boots, pants, and a top held up by suspenders, all in one. Add a colorful flannel shirt, and you look backwoods but natty, all at once. Chiggers. These are tiny parasitic bugs that lurk in the woods and weeds. They attach themselves to your skin, often around exposed ankles, and feed on the fluids in your skin cells. The enzyme that they inject causes little red welts that can itch for weeks on end. Chipper. Cheerful, jaunty, in upbeat humor. The term, originating from the Old English, related to one's frisky moves more than to his outlook or state of mind. But since it's logical to assume that one who trips merrily down the road is in a good mood, the meaning of the word soon broadened. Chiseler. Although literally referring to one who chisels stone or wood, the word more often describes a thief, especially one who methodically chips away at the victim's fortune. Chortle. To chuckle or laugh gleefully. Circumspectly. Cautiously, watchfully, often a little furtively, not wanting to call attention to oneself. Citadel. A fortress, particularly one like a castle high atop a medieval town. Cochlea. A snail-shaped part of the human inner ear. Codgers and Geezers. Eccentric but amusing old men. The words for women who reach old age appear to be less forgiving. Coefficient. In mathematics, this is the number before a variable. In the formula 25x + 5y = 100, for instance, 25 and 5 are both coefficients. Or so my math friends tell me. Colloquy. A conversation, especially a learned or formal one. Color Commentator. The broadcast partner of a sports play-by-play announcer. The \"color man\" (or woman) is often an ex-athlete who can add depth and analysis to what's happening in the game. Con man (or woman). Someone who tricks unsuspecting victims out of some of their money. \"Con\" is short for confidence; the swindler gains the victim's confidence, then exploits it. Concoction. A food item made, sometimes without benefit of a recipe, from many ingredients. Confit. A piece of meat, often duck, cooked in its own fat. Conflate. To combine something. Usually it's not something physical but rather conceptual, as in conflating two arguments or ideas. Confounding. Confusing or surprising. Doing something unexpected. Conjure. To make things even ghosts, spirits, and the devil materialize, especially using chants or incantations. Magicians with this talent are sometimes called \"conjurers.\" We often stick an unnecessary \"up\" after this word, as in \"conjuring up an excuse.\" Conniving. Scheming, conspiring to do something improper or illegal. Consecrate. To declare something, such as the ground where heroes have fallen, as sacred. In Christianity, the term also refers to symbolically turning bread and wine into the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Consternation. Frustration and confusion. It's easy to be consternated by an overly wordy and tangled explanation of something. Contemporaneous. Occurring at the same time that another event is happening. Conundrum. A difficult problem or dilemma. Nobody seems to know the origin of this curious word. An online sleuth called \"The Word Detective\" concludes that the most reasonable theory \"is that conundrum' originated as a joke among university students in 16th century England, probably concocted as a pseudo-Latin nonsense word.\" Coolie. A derogatory slur for unskilled Asian ? especially Chinese ? laborers employed in mines and on the railroads of the early American West. The term was borrowed from British colonialists' word for Indian servants. Cooties. A derogatory or squeamish term for bugs, especially lice, as well as for imaginary critters that slovenly people are said to be carrying. Copse. A small group of trees, often appearing in the midst of an otherwise barren location. Cornpone. A colorful synonym for cornbread, a simple bread made from cornmeal in a hot skillet. Poor mountaineers often had little beyond cornpone and a bit of bacon to eat. Lard or pork drippings served as the skillet oil. Because cornpone was associated with humble people living back in the \"hills and hollows,\" the term became yet another unflattering adjective, as in \"cornpone humor.\" Cornucopia. A horn of plenty, from which spill such things as fruit, flowers, and corn. Corny. Trite, banal, overly cute or sentimental. Corollary. Something, based in mathematics, that one assumes to be true based on earlier, proven statements that have been proved. An inference or deduction. If it's a given that the world is round, for instance, then we don't have to worry about approaching and falling off the \"edge of the earth.\" Corroborate. To confirm or give supportive testimony regarding a story or event. Cotton gin. A machine that separates seeds and husks from sticky cotton fiber. \"Gin\" is short for \"engine.\" Cotton to. To approve or like a lot. In early industrial days, to \"cotton\" or \"cotton well\" meant that fibers were going together smoothly. The term was broadened to indicate that people as well as threads were getting along well. You'll hear the term as a negative in movie \"westerns,\" as in, \"I don't cotton to that kind of talk.\" Covered dish. A name sometimes given to homemade, often fattening, casserole recipes that people bring to church picnics and \"pot luck\" dinners. Covet. To long or wish for something, often enviously. Cow chips. Cattle droppings. Also often called \"cow pies\" or \"cow patties.\" Cranny. A narrow space or crevice. The word is customarily combined with another: nook, as in \"He looked in every nook and cranny.\" Crazy quilt. A patchwork cover sewn from irregular scraps. The term is often broadened to describe places ? even ideas ? cobbled from odd sources. Croup. Inflammation of the larynx and trachea, producing labored breathing and, often, a hacking cough reminiscent of the bark of a seal. Crucible. In concrete terms, a crucible is a strong vessel, often made of porcelain, in which materials can be combined and melted, even at extremely hot temperatures. Metaphorically, one who is thrown into a crucible, say a roiling controversy, had better be ready for some heat as well. Cryonics. A belief that the ultra-low-temperature freezing of human or animal corpses could preserve them so that future medical advances might enable their revival and healing. Not to be confused with cryogenics, which is the study of phenomena that occur at very low temperatures. Cubicle farm. A sarcastic reference to an array of small office workspaces, each surrounded by partitions to give their inhabitants the illusion of privacy. At VOA, we call one such arrangement in our large newsroom \"Podland.\" Culinary. Pronounced \"CULL-ih-nairy,\" the word refers to matters of the kitchen or cooking. Chef-level work is called the \"culinary art.\" Cumbersome. Awkward, unwieldy, hard to manipulate physically. Cup of Joe. A cup of coffee. The term could relate to the average American - the \"average Joe,\" or perhaps it dates to World War I, when U.S. admiral Josephus Daniels broke with naval tradition by banning alcohol, including wine in the officers' mess, aboard American ships. Thereafter coffee - deridingly called a cup of Joe - was the strongest brew on board. Curlicue. A coiled shape, often favored in architectural design. D Dalliance. A frivolous use of time. \"Goofing around\" rather than working. Damper. A movable plate that regulates air flow in a furnace, fireplace, or stove. Dapper. Up to date in dress and manners. And there's an extra quality to the word, too, a sort of jauntiness or even raffishness, reminiscent of the movie star Cary Grant. A dapper fellow - and the word is more often applied to men - is not just well appointed. He's a sauve charmer. Daunting. Intimidating and discouraging, often filled with fear. Davy Jones's locker. Another name, or euphemism, for the sea bottom, the graveyard of dead sailors and sunken ships. In early sea lore, Davy Jones was the devil, or the evil spirit of the sea. Davy Jones's Locker.

Decorum. Proper behavior or manners. Decrepit. Worn out, neglected, ruined. Denigrate. To criticize something harshly or unfairly, to disparage something or someone. Denizen. Strictly, this means any inhabitant of a place. But the word also gives special status to animals and those of mystical powers, as in \"denizens of the deep\" or \"denizens of the fields.\" Denouement. Pronounced \"day-new-MAW,\" this French word refers to the final outcome of a long series of events. It is often used to describe the last part of the final act of a stage play. Depredations. The ravages left behind by plunderers or marauders. Deprivation. Extreme poverty. A state in which one is deprived of even the basics of life. Be careful with this word. \"Depravation,\" spelled with the \"a\" instead of the \"i,\" means moral decay and degeneracy. That version is an offshoot of the word \"depraved.\" Devolve. To pass to someone at a lower level, as in delegating authority to subordinates. Dicey. Unpredictable, risky, even dangerous. Dickens. A substitute for \"devil\" by those who are uncomfortable uttering anything to do with Satan. They prefer to say that something \"scared the dickens\" (or the daylight) out of them. The term has no apparent connection to British novelist Charles Dickens. Dilettante. Someone who flits from subject to subject or activity to activity without putting a lot of effort into any of them. Diminution. A reduction in the size or importance of something. A diminishing.

Those without skeletal frameworks are called \"blimps.\" Rigid, hydrogen-filled airships such as the massive Zeppelins of the mid-20th century all but disappeared following several terrible explosions. Today's dirigibles are filled with inert helium gas. Discourse. Written or spoken communication, often the back-and-forth kind, as in a debate. Disdain. Contempt. The verb form means that one scorns another or believes someone or something is beneath his consideration. Disdainful. Showing contempt or lack of respect for someone or something. Disillusionment and dissolution. The former means disenchantment. Even idealists can get disillusioned during hard times. The latter means decay or disintegration. Disillusionment can foster psychological and physical breakdowns. Dissolute. Marked by excess, such as showing the effects of too much drinking over too long a time. Dither. A confused state. One who dithers is flustered, agitated, all a-twitter. The word comes from a Middle English word meaning \"tremble.\" Ditzy. Silly, balmy, more than slightly daft. Dixie. A popular name for the southern United States. \"Dixie\" was also an enormously popular informal anthem of the segregated South, having come from blackface \"minstrel\" shows. No one can say for sure how \"Dixie\" came to be a synonym for the Old South, but one theory ties it to $10 notes, or \"dixes,\" issued by a bank in French-speaking New Orleans, Louisiana. Doddering. Feeble, even senile. The word is often combined with others, as in \"you doddering old fool.\" Dodo. A clumsy, flightless \u2014 and thus now-extinct, bird. Its inability to cope in a hostile world of predators has become a metaphor for human ineffectiveness and bungling as well. Doggerel. Comic verse. An \"grieve.\" Doozy. A doozy is something that is really difficult, or something that's extraordinary or extreme. Dork. This is not something you want to be called. A dork is a loser, an incompetent and even stupid person. Believe it or not, the word dates to the early 20th Century. Doting. Spoiling, acting uncritically toward another. A proud parent dotes on his or her child. Double entendre. A word or phrase that's open to two quite different interpretations, one of them often naughty. This headline, for example: \"Prostitutes appeal to priest.\" Doughboys. American infantrymen in World War I. There is debate about the origin of the term. One theory ascribes it to the doughy white clay that soldiers used to clean their white belts. Another states that it was other Allies' derogatory term for U.S. forces, who were said to be \"soft\" for showing up late to the war. The term had been used (sparingly) in other conflicts and may also have had its origin in cavalrymen's contempt for ordinary foot soldiers. Dour. Brooding or glum. One with a dour disposition isn't enjoying life at the moment. By the way, the word is pronounced \"DOO-er,\" not \"DOW-er,\" for reasons that escape me. Dowager. While the word literally applies to an elderly woman of high standing, it is often applied to once-glamorous, now fading buildings as well. Dragoon. To obligate or bully one to do something, perhaps by force. Dragoons were French soldiers who sometimes compelled peasants to leave the farm and join the military. Dreidel. A four-sided, spinning top, enjoyed by children during the eight-day Jewish holiday of Hanukkah. Dressed to the nines. This is thought to be a corruption of the Old English \"to the eyne,\" or eye.

This would be a great word to apply to a huge monster in one of those Japanese films: \"Godzilla Meets Gargantua.\" Gargoyle.

Calling your job a gig' is a way of saying I'm not really emotionally invested in my job, which I find boring and soulless, and I'm only doing it so I can act/write novels/play jazz saxophone on the weekends.'\" \"Gig\" also has many other meanings.

It's a porch swing that looks like a living-room couch, hanging from a low frame. But it doesn't swing in an arc. It slides forward and backward gently without upsetting one's stomach. Combine that lazy to-and-fro motion with comfy glider cushions and a summer breeze, and you have a mesmerizing invitation to take a nap! Gloaming.

The term comes from an 1888 British children's story by that name in which a well-behaved orphan girl is given a pair of shoes by a wealthy man, lives a stellar life in which she becomes a teacher, and is rewarded with wealth of her own. The term is now often used mockingly, as if \"do-gooder\" behavior is na\u00efve and foolish. Gorse. A short, spiny, evergreen shrub common to Western Europe, especially Ireland and rural England.

A roadside or small-town restaurant of dubious quality, whose food may taste delicious but will leave you loosening your belt after the meal. Green eyeshades.

A stretcher on wheels, used to transport living patients and, on occasion, those who have passed away. Gussied-up. Made up in a flashy way that doesn't always have the desired effect of making one more attractive. The origin of this curious term is uncertain. One theory associates it with an early 20th-century piece of fabric called a \"gusset\" that was sewn into people's clothes to make them fit better. Another idea is that it traces to the Australian slang word \"Augustus\" that refers to a \"dandy\" \u2014 a man who is exceptionally concerned about his appearance. H Haiku. A very, very short \u2014 just 17 syllable \u2014 form of poetry, developed in Japan. Hail fellow well met.

The word is often combined with \"days,\" as in \"Back in our halcyon days . . . .\" Ham. This is the upper part of a pig's leg, of course, but it has also come to describe a person who outrageously overdramatizes stories. \"Hamming it up\" means the person is really adding flourishes. On stage, this is frowned upon, because the \"ham\" is stealing scenes from other actors. Two of the theories of the origin of this meaning: It traces to Hamlet, or it may refer to the ham fat that actors once used to remove their make-up. Hammock. A bed \u2014 sometimes one that swings \u2014 made of canvas or cloth mesh that is suspended from fixed structures by cords. Haphazard. Disorganized, random, casual or even careless. Hapless.

As a verb, to \"hawk\" means to loudly promote one's wares. Hawking. Selling something, such as pamphlets on the street or hot dogs in a stadium, from place to place in small quantities. This usually involves cries such as \"beer here!\" to attract attention. Haymow.

In the United States, hex signs are Pennsylvania Dutch folk art meant, despite their name, to bring farmers good luck, not cast a spell on their neighbors.

Stuck in one's ways or attitudes. High Horse. One gets on his high horse to opine grandly on a topic, as if from a position of certitude.

Haughty, stuck-up, much like an earlier Wild Word: highfalutin'. An old English verb, hoit, referred to romping around noisily - another form of showing off. Hoity-toity. Self-important, pompous, stuck up. Oddly enough, the word traces to the Old English verb \"hoit,\" which had just the opposite meaning, involving noisy romps around a room. Hoity-toity people avoid hoiting at all cost! Hokum. Wild exaggeration or artifice by a huckster, designed to impress, often to convince others to spend their money on something that is worthless or nowhere near the value described by the salesman. Hologram. A three-dimensional image made from microscopic laser light waves that, when viewed, seem to make the image turn, twist or hover. Thus, holograms are extremely difficult for counterfeiters to copy. Homesteader. An American pioneer who had been granted a parcel of land in return for settling the vast expanses of the American West. Homewrecker. A third party who is blamed for the breakup of a marriage. This word should not be confused with \"housewrecker,\" which describes a demolition expert. Hooey. Nonsense or senseless talk, as in, especially, a bunch of hooey. Hoosegow. A slang term, often heard in B-grade detective movies, for a jail or prison. The word evolved from the Spanish \"juzgado de guardia,\" or police court \u2014 usually a night court that was one quick step from a minimum of a night in jail. Hoosiers. The Midwest state of Indiana is called the \"Hoosier State,\" and its residents, \"Hoosiers.\" Nobody is quite sure why. One story is that pioneer settlers were a little nervous opening the doors of their shacks and sod houses. \"Who's Zher?\" they would say. No wonder the state legislature instead prefers to call Indiana the \"Crossroads of America.\" Hopscotch. A playground game on which children \u2014 or foolhardy adults \u2014 hop from square to square. It's uncertain where the \"scotch\" part of the name came from, since the game was originally Roman and is played all over the world. Howitzer. A large, high-angle, muzzle-loaded artillery piece that fires shells high into the air but for short distances. Its name, from the Dutch, first referred to catapult-like siege guns of the 1700s.

Skilled, except that he died trying to land his biplane on the summit of Mt. Everest. Humongous. Really, really huge. The word is a deliberate exaggeration that offends linguists. The Web site World Wide Words quotes William Hartston, writing in the British newspaper The Independent, as calling it \"surely one of the ugliest words ever to slither its way into our dictionaries.\" Hump Day. Wednesday, the middle day of the work week. It's all downhill to a weekend after that! Hunkered. An old Scottish term referring to a crouched position. Sometimes the redundant term \"hunkered down\" is used. Hushpuppies. These are bite-sized bits of deep-fried cornbread.

One's bearing - how you carry yourself. Thus we sometimes read about a person's low mien (not a Chinese delicacy) or regal mien. Milliner. A person who makes hats, especially women's chapeaus. The term appears to trace to references to makers of fancy goods in Milan, Italy. Minstrel.

Pronounced muffa-LOTT-uhs, these are tasty, often toasted, sandwiches in rounded bread loaves. Invented by a New Orleans Sicilian grocer, they are filled with authentic Italian meats and a spicy olive salad. Note: While New Orleanians spread mayonnaise on just about every other sandwich, including roast-beef po-boys, they recoil at the thought of mayo on a muffuletta. Muleshoe. While this word could refer to a metal shoe similar to a horseshoe, it also describes a kind of casual human shoe, closed in the front and completely open in the back. Myopic. Near-sighted. The term does not refer to a medical condition alone, but also to one's tendency to pay attention to things that are close at hand rather than in the world at large. P P. R.

The origin of the word is debated. \"Pips\" are little things, and the word may relate to the sound given off by a weak baby bird. Piquant. Spicy, pungent, savory, having a pleasant taste. Pithy. Concise and forceful. Pith is the substance beneath the surface of a plant, such as the \"white part\" of an orange under its skin, so \"pithy\" relates to getting to the heart of a matter.

They quickly find that there's no money at all. Poobah. A top official or executive, especially one who enjoys lording it over his or her subordinates. The term is borrowed from a character called the \"Pooh-Bah\" in the Gilbert and Sullivan light opera, \"The Mikado.\" Poppycock. Nonsense; drivel; meaningless talk with no substance whatever. The word traces to Dutch terms that, roughly translated, refer to \"doll excrement,\" in other words, something quite insubstantial. Pork. In a political context, pork or \"pork barrel\" appropriations are a slice of fat off the government hog, directed specifically to a single state or congressional district. Shrewd members of Congress are skilled at directing projects such as new highways, bridges, and factories their constituents' way. The pork is often quietly appended to totally unrelated bills that are so popular that they easily pass. Either the pork goes unnoticed or nobody says anything, since \"everybody does it.\" (Not really, but to critics, it seems that way.) Posse.

A slang term originating in the early 1900s, meaning \"to leave quickly,\" as a variation on the even older \"skedaddle.\" No one can say for sure where \"23-skidoo,\" in particular, came from. Wisegeek says it might have something to do with New York's famous Flatiron Building on 23rd Street in Manhattan.

The police gave the \"23-skidoo\" to men who loitered nearby, waiting for a pretty woman and a good gust. Skosh. A dab, a touch, a teeny bit. People often ask their tailors for a \"skosh more room\" around the waist, for instance, when getting fitted.

Slake. To satisfy, especially as in quenching one's thirst. Slapstick. Exaggerated physical comedy, often involving pratfalls or pies to the face.

Mayonnaise on a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich, for instance. Slipshod. Sloppy, shabby, careless, halfhearted. Smarter than your average bear.

Yogi thought he was quite clever at devising ways to steal campers' picnic baskets at Jellystone National Park \u2014 a takeoff on Yellowstone Park. Delivered in an affected manner borrowed from a human character in another TV show, \"I'm smarter than your average bear\" became a catchphrase in the popular culture. Smidgen. A little bit. Sometimes shortened to \"smidge.\" Smithereens. This is a fun word to say.

Perhaps an Englishman named Smith dropped a glass goblet, and it smashed to smithereens. Smokey Bear. He is a brawny but gentle mascot of the U.S. National Park Service. In his trademark drill-sergeant hat, he sternly reminds campers, \"Only YOU can prevent forest fires.\" Smooshed. A made-up word not in most dictionaries. It's a descriptive variation of \"smashed.\" Snarky. This is one of those new-age words you won't find in most dictionaries, even though it derives from the century-old British word \"snark,\" meaning to nag or find fault with. A snarky remark is laced with snide disrespect. Now you'll have to look up \"snide\"! Snide. Sarcastic, in a snotty sort of way.

Sod houses. \"Soddies,\" as settlers on the Great Plains called these houses, were made from clumps of coarse bluestem grass in rich soil that were held together by their intricate web of roots and sliced into long strips with a \"breaking plow.\" Lacking enough trees for wood to build a complete house, pioneers stacked sod in rows to make the walls, then laid more strips atop precious boards that formed joists and the outlines of the attic. Finally, cloth was hung below the ceiling. It caught most, but not all, of the dirt that sifted down onto the family below. Sodom and Gomorrah. These were cities on the Jordan River that, according to the book of Genesis in the Bible, were destroyed by God, who rained down fire and brimstone to punish their inhabitants for their sinful, lascivious ways. The two cities are often lumped into one place when speaking of a \"Sin City\" of today. Solicitous. Expressing care or concern. A solicitous person solicits information about you, your family, and your well-being. Solomonic. Exceedingly wise. The term invokes the name of the biblical King Solomon who, most famously, found a way to determine the real mother of a baby who had been switched with an infant that died. Confronting two claimants, he raised his sword and announced that he would bisect the baby and give half to each. The real mother screamed and begged him to spare the child, even if it meant awarding it to the pretender. Clearly, Solomon decreed, she was the rightful parent. Sortie. Pronounced \"SOR-tee\" in English, this French word means a sudden military attack, usually from what was originally a defensive position. Soubriquet. A familiar, rather than formal, name, often applied to a person. Thus, parents will call their son James \"Jim,\" and Jim often becomes \"Jimmy.\" It's pronounced SOO'-bri-kay, after the French. Spate. A large number or volume all at once. An outburst, as in, a \"spate of angry e-mails.\" Speakeasy. An establishment, carefully guarded by a suspicious doorman, that served alcoholic drinks during the Prohibition period from 1923 to 1933, when such sales were banned. Pirate hideouts once carried the name, and a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, woman who sold liquor without a license is said to have advised her customers to \"speak easy\" if they wanted to buy some. Specs. Specifications, as in the blueprints and other particular requirements for an engineering job. Spelling bee. A contest in which contestants, one at a time, are required to spell a difficult word. Those spelling it incorrectly are eliminated, until only one person, who spells the word that one other finalist missed, is left standing as champion. The energy and busyness of the hardworking honeybee inspired this term as well as \"quilting bee,\" \"sewing bee,\" and others. Sphynx. In ancient Egypt, a sphynx was a tactile representation of a sun god, often in a lion's shape and wearing a headdress of the pharaohs. Spiel. From Yiddish and pronounced \"shpeel,\" this is a long and energetic story, meant to persuade. Spin doctor. \"Spin\" is the fashionable political term for putting one's own, highly partisan, interpretation on events. You spin them to suit the best interests of your candidate or cause. And a maestro of spin is a \"spin doctor.\" Spitting image. A perfect likeness. The exact origin of this odd term is uncertain, but one theory dates it to the early American South, where syrupy accents were sometimes misunderstood by visitors. It's thought that a common expression back then, \"He's the very spirit of his father,\" was mistaken as \"the very spit of his father.\" Spoon. As I've used it, this has nothing to do with an eating utensil, unless it's affectionately caressing the cheek of a lover. Spooning is an old-fashioned word for amorous cuddling. Spud. A nickname for the potato. As if often the case, there are many theories on the origin of this term. One is that it's name for the \"spudder,\" a spade-like tool used to dig up potatoes. Spunk. Spirit, determination, pluck. Spunky. Lively, spirited, plucky. The word is said to have devolved from an English and Scottish term for \"spark.\" Squatter. A person who takes occupancy of property he or she does not own. Some of America's most famous squatters were those who \"jumped the gun\" on the great Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889 and laid claim to land that didn't belong to them. Squeezebox. A concertina or accordion, especially a small type favored in Louisiana's French-speaking Acadiana region. Stance. In addition to describing the literal position of one's feet, this word also refers to one's point of view on an issue or question. Steadfast. Holding firm in one's stand or convictions. Stellar. Outstanding, of star quality. The star-related root of the world is similar to that in the word \"constellation.\" Stetson. The brand name that has become almost a generic term for a western hat, just as the names \"Coke,\" \"Xerox,\" and \"Scotch Tape\" have come to stand for genres of products. Felt Stetson hats have broad brims that keep some of the sun and rain off a cowboy's face and neck. Those with an especially high crown are sometimes called \"ten-gallon [38-liter] hats\" because they look like they can hold a whole lot of water. In fact, only three or so liters will fit in one. Stoops. From the Dutch, this is a word for a short flight of steps leading up to a house. One finds neighbors lolling and watching their children at play in the streets from their stoops in blue-collar neighborhoods, especially, in older American cities such as Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New Orleans. Straggle. To move slowly, stray from a group, or lag behind. Stragglers arrive late to many events. Straight-arrow. Straightforward and honest; morally upright traits of a \"straight shooter.\" Strait-laced. Rigid, formal, prim and proper \u2014 even \"up tight\" in the current vernacular. You may know that a strait is a narrow body of water, a passage, and strait-laced as an adjective also comes from the concept of narrowing or tightening. Specifically, it traces to the excessive tightening of a corset in the days when it was fashionable for women to wear one. Stunt. The noun form of this word, referring to pranks or difficult maneuvers (executed by \"stunt men\" or women), is well known. The verb form, to stunt, refers to stopping or hindering something, as in \"stunting the growth\" of someone or something. Succulent. Moist and tasty. Full of juice. Suffragist. A supporter of suffrage, or the right to vote, especially for women. Those who mocked the most radical, female supporters of women's suffrage at the turn of the 20th century preferred to call them by the derogatory term \"suffragettes.\" Supercilious. Haughty, arrogant, \"putting on airs\" of superiority. Superfluous. More than is needed and, often, serving no useful purpose. Supplant. To supersede or take the place of something. You can be pretty sure, for instance, that a new superstar will come along and supplant a former sports hero. Supplications. Humble, earnest pleas for something, such as forgiveness or a job. Surname. The family name, as opposed to the \"given\" first and middle names in many European and American homes. The term is a modification of the old, English \"sirename,\" meaning the (last) name a man took from his father. Surrepticiously. Secretly or without someone's knowledge. Suzerainty. Dominion by one entity \u2014 often a nation \u2014 over another. Swabbing. Cleaning with something such as a bandage in the case of a wound or with a mop when referring to a floor. On a boat, one swabs the deck. Swashbuckling. Pirates are swashbucklers, and others can swashbuckle, too, thanks to the evolution of the word. The \"swash\" comes from an old word for tapping one's foot on the ground, as fencers (and sword-wielding pirates) do when they attack. The \"buckle\" doesn't fit around one's pants; a \"buckler\" was a small shield, worn (by right-handers) on their left arms for protection. Somehow, this got all smished into a word describing the flamboyantly daring. Swindle. To cheat or defraud a person through deceit Switchback. One of the winding curves that enabled first railroad trains, and then cars, to make it up and down steep mountains by slowly zig-zagging around them. T Tabula rasa. A clean slate or fresh start. Something with no previous agenda or preconceived ideas. The term traces to Roman wax tablets, used for recording notes. When the notes were no longer needed, the wax could be melted, leaving a blank surface ready to record new thoughts. Taciturn. This is a word that I learned a long time ago from a challenging little book called 30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary. It describes not just quiet behavior, but deliberate, calculating silence. Someone who is taciturn wants to say very little and does. \"The silent type,\" we sometimes call taciturn people. Tacky. Common, lacking in taste or class. Tallow. Tallow. A solid, slick substance made from boiled animal fat. It is used to make candles and soap. Tar Heel State. North Carolina's nickname. Barefoot backwoodsmen there once made a lot of turpentine, which left behind oozy, black pitch that stuck to their heels (and soles and toes). Tequila. One of several potent Mexican \"mescal\" liquors made from the fermented juice of the spiky-looking agave plant. Legend has it that you'll find a worm in the highest-quality tequilas, but this is a marketing gimmick by certain brands. Terrarium. A bowl, glass box, or other confined container in which to grow plants. The hole. Prison jargon for cells to which convicts are sentenced to solitary confinement. Throw in the towel. Give up, quit, surrender. It's a boxing term, referring to the point when a fighter is beaten and his trainer throws a towel into the ring to alert the referee that the bout must be stopped. Tightfisted. Frugal or cheap holding fast to a dollar. Tinsel. Long, thin strands of shiny metal, designed specifically to accentuate the glow of candles, originally, then lights, on a Christmas tree. In fancy Victorian homes, the tinsel was made of real silver, but it tarnished easily and fell out of favor. Modern tinsel is aluminum-based. Tizzy. A flustered or greatly animated state. Sometimes we get \"all a-tizzy\" over something exciting. To a T. If something fits, or suits you, \"to a T,\" it means that the fit is perfect. Some sources say the term traces to the precise of use of T-squares by draftsmen. Others say the \"T\" once stood for \"tittle,\" as in paying attention to \"every jot and tittle.\" A tittle is a tiny amount or iota. To boot. Something additional, as in \"We saw a show and got a discount to boot.\" One story pegs the term's origin to the Old American West. There, it is said, when a trade of goods was agreed upon but the value of one item was greater than the other, the owner of the more valuable item would throw in a little cash to even things up. The other person could take the money right \"to boot\" \u2014 slipping it into his cowboy boot. Toddle. To walk with short, slightly unsteady steps. Infants and old folks toddle. And what do we say to an oldster who's about to toddle off? Toodle-oo! Toodle, not toddle! Tommy gun. A .45-caliber submachine gun, invented by John T. Thompson, that became the weapon of choice of both gangsters and federal agents during the \"roaring\" 1920s. Torpid. Slow, sluggish. Torpid people are disinterested, apathetic. Tory. Tories were American colonists who supported the British side during the American Revolution. The name is taken from a British political party that was an opposition party to the Whigs. Toss Your Cookies. Throw up. Vomit. Tough row to hoe. Often misquoted as a tough road to hoe, the expression, which ties to hard weeding in a cotton or vegetable patch, now means, more broadly, any difficult task. Town Crier. In a tradition brought from Europe, criers, employed by the community, would walk the streets of early America, often at dusk, carrying lanterns or handbells, calling out public announcements. These would often begin, \"Hear ye, hear ye,\" or the more formal \"oyez,\" which is still used to bring many U.S. courtrooms to order. Transcendent. Beyond the normal, incomparable. Transcendentalist. One who practices transcendental meditation, or \"TM.\" Introduced in the 1950s by the Indian guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi - who for a time was the spiritual adviser to the Beatles - it involves seated contemplation, with one's eyes closed, for twenty minutes a day. In the early 1970s, the people of little Fairfield, Iowa, were surprised to find a number of transcendentalists (many in eastern dress) in their midst. They had purchased the buildings of private Parsons College, which had gone out of business, and began setting up a transcendentalist university in the midst of Iowa corn country. Now called Maharishi University of Management, the school teaches students what it calls \"pure consciousness within themselves as the source of all knowledge.\" Trappings. Ornamental clothing or furnishings. The word is often used to describe handsome or fashionable adornments, as in the \"trappings of success.\" Traverse. To cross or pass through a place. The word's root is the same as the root of \"travel.\" Triangle Trade. Trade among three distant regions, notably this ungodly exchange of slaves from the late 17th to early 19th centuries: Caribbean merchants would ship sugar, tobacco, and cotton to mills in New England or Europe. Those owners would ship rum, manufactured goods, and textiles to Africa. And \"slavers\" would send captured tribesmen as human cargo to the New World. Trig. Short for trigonometry, which, I'm told \u2014 God knows I had to look this up \u2014 has to do with computing the length of the sides of triangles by knowing the triangle's angles and measuring the length of one side. (Math brains: help me out here!) Trill. A pleasant, fluttering sound such as the call of a wren or other songbird. Truncate. To shorten or lop off something. Tumbleweed. A short Russian thistle shrub, common in many parts of the world, that dries and breaks away from its roots in autumn, then rolls like a ball in the wind across the plain. Tumbleweeds stick in barbed-wire fences and are sure to blow in front of your car when the dust kicks up, scaring you half to death. In one of their first hits, the Sons of the Pioneers western group sang that they belonged on the range, \"drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds.\" Tungsten. A grayish-white metal, mined for use in electrical filaments and acid formulas, as well as other industrial purposes. Also called \"wolfram,\" it carries the "}
