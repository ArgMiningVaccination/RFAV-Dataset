Chiropractic is a systematic healing art that dates back to 1895. It is based on the scientific principles of the natural structure of the body and how it is designed to function. By working on these principles, a chiropractor is able to support the spine and nervous system, allowing them to heal on their own. However, chiropractic is not limited to treating only the spine. Our chiropractors see a wide range of symptoms and conditions that improve with chiropractic care, the most common of which are neck pain, headaches, and low back pain. Chiropractors have received training in diagnostic assessment, which enables them to determine if your illness qualifies for chiropractic treatment or whether you would benefit more from co-management or a proper referral. Chiropractic care primarily focuses on diseases and injuries of the joints, muscles, and nerves. These have a significant impact on overall health and quality of life. Qualified chiropractors treat the body holistically, which means they look at the entire body rather than just the area of pain. As a result, they are able to treat the root cause of your problem. Our practitioners can also provide professional advice on nutrition, injury prevention, lifestyle and sleep issues and concerns. A range of orthotics, therapeutic products and rehabilitation services are also on offer. What techniques are used? During a Chiropractic treatment a range of techniques are used, including: - Manual / traditional adjustments - Low Force and instrument techniques (Activator, Drop Piece, Cranials and Blocks) - Soft tissue massage - Dry Needling Chiropractic for neck pain Neck pain can range from slight discomfort to severe or chronic pain that impairs movement and causes headaches or migraines. Among the telltale signs of neck pain are: - Sharp or jolting pains - Headaches or migraines - Muscles spasms in the neck or back - Difficulty gripping or lifting objects - Soreness or stiffness - Problems with reflexes, sensation or strength in arms and hands - Pain, tingling or numbness in the shoulder, arm or hand - Reduced movement in the neck, shoulders and arms - Sleep issues Neck pain is commonly caused by poor posture, an uncomfortable sleeping position, repetitive movements, and trauma or injury. The good news is that by addressing the underlying cause, we can eliminate it with chiropractic care. Orthotics and chiropractic Unleveled feet are the source of many spinal and joint problems. Any fallen arches or foot misalignment can cause back or neck pain, as well as pain in the feet, legs, knees and hips. This type of pain can cause long-term joint disintegration as well as muscle, tendon and ligament issues. In terms of overall musculoskeletal health and wellbeing, having your feet assessed can be just as important as having your spine assessed. Foot Levellers 3D scanning is used by our chiropractors to assess the balance and health of your feet.
