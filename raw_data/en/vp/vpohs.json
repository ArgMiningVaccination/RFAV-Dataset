[Results](#tab-1802256-3) Add up your points to determine your results. 0: Perfect score. 1-3: You scored in the lower category, but you are not off the hook. It is never too early to work on prevention. 4-8 : You should take a close look at your health and habits, as your immune system likely needs help. You might be at risk of developing more health issues if you do not address the points where you scored high. 9-24: People with poor immune status are in a higher risk of more severe infection, hospitalization and poor outcomes. Sadly, they may not respond as well to a vaccine either. You may want to start working on your lifestyle immediately.
