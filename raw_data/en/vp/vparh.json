Fractionated Coconut oil is more easily absorbed by the skin and it's odorless making it an excellent all-around diluent. In cosmetic use, it is ideal as a carrier oil for essential oils in massages, nourishing moisturizers and hair treatments. Coconut carrier oil is also used as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and wound healer. - We recommended avoiding the application of Meditation roll-on and any other essential oils topically to your pets. If you like to use a diffuser, ensure there is proper ventilation and that your pet can leave the room if desired. If in doubt, ask a vet with aromatherapy experience for safety guidelines for your pet, or avoid essential oil use around your pet altogether. For further pet safety guidelines, we recommend picking up a copy of Kristen Leigh Bell's book Holistic Aromatherapy for Animals or joining an animal aromatherapy Facebook group.
