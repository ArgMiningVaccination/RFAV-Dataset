Today, any type of healing that doesn't go along with Western medicine and the pharmaceutical industry is considered \"holistic\" or \"metaphysical.\" And the funny part is that all Western medicine does is tries to imitate what is already in nature through drugs that can be patented, and they always come up short. That's why pharmaceutical drugs come with a laundry list of side effects. There's so much [evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3396089/) to support holistic and metaphysical healing, and there generally aren't many or any side effects. What is Metaphysical Healing? Holistic healing is a natural type of healing, such as acupuncture, herbs, tea blends, Altaic mumie (resin), aromatherapy (essential oils), Yoga, and sound healing (Tibetan bowls). Metaphysical healing is any type of healing that includes healing with energy, like Reiki, bioenergy, Theta Healing, PEAT, past life regressions, Tai Chi, Qi Gong, and Pranayama. It's an \"alternative\" way of treating the root cause of illness, rather than just treating the symptoms. It's any type of healing that helps the person get well and stay well without destroying any other (healthy) parts in the process. Metaphysical healing is also healing of the mind, of the heart and of the soul. Some illnesses begin within the soul and physical symptoms are considered to be the last stage of an illness' progression. Why is Metaphysical Healing Important? Not just anyone can be a healer, but all of us should take an interest in metaphysical and holistic healing and claim responsibility for our own well-being. And that responsibility is what many modern people tend to avoid. It can be scary and terrifying taking on the responsibility of our own health, but who else can take better care of us than ourselves? We know our own bodies the best, we know what pains us, what makes us happy, what aids us, and what derails us. We know how we feel after we eat certain things. We know why we cry and why we laugh, when we feel the best, and when we feel the worst. But taking over the control of our own health and taking on the responsibility that comes with it, well, that's isn't as easy as it may sound. That's why we have holistic practices and metaphysical healing guides. They are there to aid us in our own journeys to guide us and help us along. Help is always given to those who remember to ask for it. Courage is always given to those who dare take it. Growth awaits all who muster up the guts to take the first step out of the collective comfort zone into the unknown. You should always consult the certified doctors and medical staff. You should be responsible and have regular checkups at the doctor's office. But if there is a problem or a symptom that Western medicine cannot cure or solve without unwanted side effects, then you may want to expand your horizons and seek additional help from metaphysical healing and energy healers. Types of Metaphysical Healing There are so many different metaphysical healing techniques at our disposal, but let's learn about 5 of our favorites... Metaphysical Healing Crystals Metaphysical healing crystals are one of the most basic and well known healing alternatives. They all have their own frequencies and vibrations, and they work on the very basic molecular level. What is not to be underestimated is that with prolonged periods of time, [healing stones](https://cosmiccuts.com/pages/healing-stones) can build up a strong immunity to many illnesses. They can help heal some of the deepest traumas and problems by working to bring the body, mind, and spirit into balance. It's important to practice patience when it comes to crystal healing. It's often best if you don't think about it. Just have them around, carry them, sleep with them, but don't pay them much mind (except when it's time for cleansing). Then, when you take inventory of your symptoms, you're likely to witness the most amazing, subtle changes. Aromatherapy Aromatherapy is one of the most popular metaphysical healing modalities because it is so gentle and soothing. It utilizes essential oils, allowing us to heal through scents. Aromatherapy can be done by gently rubbing essential oils on acupressure points on the body, massaging with essential oils, or inhaling or diffusing blends of essential oils. This metaphysical healing technique is for everyone, but especially for people who have problems with overthinking, overactive nerves, emotional outbursts, melancholy, lethargy, and depression. Through our sense of smell, we can trigger and soothe some of the most unpleasant memories, and we can heal. Smell is a very important sense, and in the long forgotten times, it was a crucial part of our survival system. Sound Healing Sound healing with Tibetan bowls or tuning forks is a popular metaphysical healing technique. It works its wonders on the molecular levels in our bodies and the etheric fields surrounding our bodies. Just like we can cleanse crystals with sound, we can also cleanse our own etheric bodies and corporeal bodies in the same way. Sound healing is best and fastest felt on the emotional and mental plane. Many people have expressed the release of mental clutter and emotional traumas through sound healing. When we feel sad or happy, we listen to music to alter or enhance our mood, so we already know it works. We love to sway, to dance, to rejoice, and to cry with music. The power of sound has metaphysical healing properties that are unparalleled when it comes to the heart and mind. Qi Gong Qi Gong is a system of coordinated body-posture and movement that is a millennia old. It includes breathing and meditation through movement, and iIt's used for the purposes of health, spirituality, and martial-arts training. With roots in Chinese medicine, philosophy, and martial arts, Qi Gong is traditionally viewed by the Chinese and throughout Asia as a practice to cultivate and balance Qi (Chi), which translates as \"life energy.\" Chi (qi) primarily means air or breath, but it is translated as \"vital energy,\" referring to energy circulating throughout the body. Qi (chi) is the central underlying principle in traditional Chinese medicine and martial arts. \"Gong\" (or kung) means \"cultivation\" or \"work,\" and it includes practice, skill, mastery, and accomplishment. It's often used to mean \"gongfu\" (Kung Fu) in the traditional sense of achievement through great effort. The two words are combined to describe systems that cultivate and balance life energy, especially for health and wellbeing. Pranayama Pryma is the practice of breath control in Yoga. In modern Yoga exercises, it consists of synchronizing the breath with movements between Asanas, but it is also a distinct breathing exercise on its own, usually practiced after Asanas. The Wim Hoff Method is heavily intertwined with Pranayama practices, which is a great introduction into more complex Pranayama techniques. The [WHM app](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/wim-hof-method-mobile-app) is free and very needed for these times. Through breathing practices and exercises, we not only strengthen our lungs and respiratory organs, but we also improve the functioning of our brains as we introduce elevated oxygen levels in our blood stream and our entire body. Oxygen makes things grow on our planet. There are studies that show giant trees, bones, and of course dinosaurs, all gigantic in size compared to us and today's planet. Why? Because there used to be elevated levels of oxygen in the atmosphere. Scientists believe that the oxygen levels were 30%-40% higher during those times than now. Final Thoughts There are many metaphysical healing practices, holistic exercises, and ways of treating our bodies with love and respect that they deserve. Do your research, go out of your comfort zone, love yourself, and take great care of yourself. If you won't, who will? * Crystals and stones should not be used as a substitute for medical advice or treatment. [Please read our full "}
