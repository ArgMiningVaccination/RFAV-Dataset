In the 1960s, a paradigm shift began that resulted in the development of other models of service delivery. In particular, Congress began to provide funds to states to begin developing services in community settings for the first time. Texas established community mental health and IDD centers in tandem with these changes in federal funding and expectations. By the 1970s the federal government developed regulations and standards for treatment of individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities who lived in institutions, which included requirements for developing Individual Program Plans (IPPs). These regulations and standards marked the shift from what was largely \"custodial care\" to a system that promoted \"active treatment.\" Active treatment, while still requiring that basic care needs be met, is notably different from custodial care by emphasizing the teaching of new skills to individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities. Active treatment guidelines also required the individual to participate in the interdisciplinary team (IDT) that develops the individual's IPP. Following the adoption of the active treatment model, professionals and other stakeholders in the field began developing tools and resources to facilitate person-centered planning. The ultimate outcome of person-centered planning is to further improve the quality of life for people with disabilities. Person-centered planning represented a fundamental shift from service planning that required providers to keep people with disabilities safe to a service planning and service delivery system that provides supports necessary for individuals to achieve their desired outcomes. In the 1980s the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), now the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), started granting waivers from the existing Medicaid rules. Waivers allow states the flexibility to design alternatives to institutional services, including the option for states to provide services in community settings as an alternative to institutional settings. In 1985 the Home and Community-based Services (HCS) waiver program was developed by Texas to waive the requirements of intermediate care facilities for individuals with an intellectual disability or related conditions (ICF/IID) services. HCS allows flexibility in the development of services for individuals who have intellectual and developmental disabilities that choose to receive their services in the community instead of an institutional setting. The federal government requires HCS be cost-effective and to include safeguards to protect participants' health and safety. Current and Future Direction Today we strive to support individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in achieving their desired lifestyles and in becoming valued members of the community by: - addressing health and safety issues in the context of their desired lifestyles; - offering opportunities to better achieve their goals; and - making the most efficient use of all available resources to accomplish these goals. Thus, waiver services are shifting from prescribing service delivery to outlining minimum requirements that must be met when designing services to support people to achieve the lifestyles they desire. Developing services that capture what is important to and for individuals who receive HCS services, as well as balancing choice and protection of health and safety, is a challenge for the service delivery system. The Department of Aging and Disability Services (DADS) uses the term person-directed planning instead of person-centered planning to talk about the ongoing planning process that helps to determine an individual's life path. Person-directed planning ensures it is the individual who is directing the process. DADS supports the expectation that every individual should have the opportunity to participate in the community, gain and maintain relationships of their choosing, express preferences, make choices, fulfill goals, and live with dignity and respect. Person-directed planning is used to represent an individual and their family's vision about how the person wishes to live, including aspirations for the future. Person-directed planning challenges DADS, HCS providers and Local Authorities (LAs) to work in cooperation to provide meaningful services and supports for the individuals who receive services. Person-Directed Planning in the Home and Community-based Services Waiver Program The LA service coordinator (SC) uses a person-directed planning process to gather information necessary to develop a Person-Directed Plan (PDP) that accurately reflects the individual's goals and desires. The PDP is a written plan developed for an applicant or individual in accordance with [Form 8665](/node/17758), HCS Person-Directed Plan, and [Appendix IV](/node/64931), Discovery Tool. It describes the supports and services necessary to preserve the applicant's or individual's health and safety, and to achieve the desired outcomes identified by the applicant or individual or legally authorized representative (LAR) on behalf of the applicant or individual. The person-directed planning process: - empowers the individual/LAR on behalf of the individual to direct the development of the plan of services and supports that meets the individual's personal outcomes; - identifies existing supports and services necessary to achieve the individual's desired outcomes; - identifies natural supports available to the individual and negotiates needed service system supports; - occurs with the support of a group of people chosen by the individual (and LAR on the individual's behalf); and - accommodates the individual's style of interaction and preferences regarding time and setting. The SC, using the PDP Discovery Tool as a basis for information gathering, conducts interviews with the individual, LAR, provider staff or others who know the person well. The results of these information-gathering interviews are compiled to: - prioritize what outcomes and needs are included on the PDP; and - identify which outcomes and needs will be met through waiver services and which will be met through non-waiver services. The individual, SC and the HCS provider develop the Individual Plan of Care (IPC) based on the PDP. The provider is then responsible for developing an Implementation Plan (IP) with the individual and LAR. The IP is a written document developed for each HCS Program service on the individual's IPC not provided through the Consumer Directed Services option that identifies how HCS services will be implemented to accomplish the outcomes identified in the PDP. The SC is expected to implement an ongoing person-directed planning process, not a single event planning process. In order to accomplish that, the SC will need to monitor and update the PDP as preferences or needs change and additional information is learned about the individual. When an individual's preferences or needs change or additional information is discovered, the SC will notify the HCS provider and submit a copy of the HCS Person-Directed Plan Outcome Summary (Page 10 of Form 8665) that will identify the desired addition/change/deletion based on the individual's preferences/needs. The program provider may then have to revise the IP(s) and/or IPC. The system must be flexible enough to keep up with the current needs and wishes of the individuals who receive HCS services. The desired outcome of the HCS service delivery model is to promote services and supports that contribute to the acquisition of meaningful outcomes for each individual. The success of this model depends on the individuals who receive HCS services, their LARs and family members, the program provider, the service coordinator and DADS. 1300 Overview of Service Delivery System Revision 10-0; Effective June 1, 2010 June 1, 2010, brings major changes to the Home and Community-based Services (HCS) service delivery system. The purpose of this section is to introduce program providers and Local Authorities to what HCS services will look like in the future. The success of HCS services will depend on individuals, their legally authorized representatives (LARs) and family members, the program providers, Local Authorities and Department of Aging and Disability Services (DADS) staff understanding the concepts behind the new system and developing the relationships that will support individuals in the HCS Program. For the individuals who receive services, their LARs and family members: The transition from an Individual Service Plan (ISP) to a Person-Directed Plan (PDP) will require that personal outcomes be communicated to the service planning team (SPT). In the past, the interdisciplinary team, which included the individual, the LAR and often family members of the individual, decided what would be included in the ISP. The PDP will place even more emphasis on the results the individual desires from services and supports. Development of an effective PDP is dependent on the SPT knowing what is important to and for the individual who is receiving HCS services. Communication between the individual, the LAR, the individual's family and the Local Authority service coordinator is critical to the development of a PDP that is meaningful for the individual. It is important that the SPT act not only on preferences that are communicated through words, but also on those preferences that are communicated through body language and maladaptive behaviors. Identifying natural supports and their roles and limits in supporting an individual is essential when linking an individual to HCS services and non-HCS services. Communication is also needed from individuals, their LARs and family members to determine whether the services being delivered are meeting the individual's needs and preferences or whether revisions are necessary. For the Local Authorities: Delivery of effective service coordination requires commitment to the individual who receives HCS services and to the collaboration with HCS and non-HCS service providers. A concerted effort must be made to get to know the individual and their natural supports very well. Collecting information from HCS and non-HCS service providers is essential in developing a PDP that is meaningful and will result in the desired outcomes. The ability to recognize service needs, to communicate the service needs to natural supports and HCS and non-HCS service providers, to link the individual to available resources, and to analyze the effectiveness of service delivery is essential to successful service coordination. Service coordinators must also have extensive knowledge of non-HCS service resources to develop a PDP and to determine what HCS services need to be purchased on behalf of an individual. Knowledge of the [HCS Program Billing Guidelines](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/documents/hcs-billing-requirements.pdf) is critical in order to ensure that the services being purchased from the HCS program provider can be reimbursed. For the HCS program providers: Eliminating the case management function from the array of services offered by the HCS program provider will likely require many changes to the program provider's organizational structure. Most program providers assigned case management duties that exceeded HCS rule requirements. However, many of the case management functions that previously were defined in rule, including coordinating the development and implementation of the service plan, coordinating and monitoring the delivery of HCS and non-HCS services, integrating various aspects of services delivered through HCS and non-HCS services, recording progress and lack of progress, record-keeping, and developing a pre-discharge plan, are now the responsibility of the Local Authority service coordinator. The program provider will need to perform some parallel functions to ensure that services are effective and that individuals are healthy, safe and satisfied with their services. For example, the program provider is responsible for developing the Implementation Plan (IP) that describes specifically how the program provider's services will achieve the assigned desired outcomes. In addition, program providers will be responsible for supervising their employees and contracted staff to ensure that they are following the IP and that progress or lack of progress is documented. If an individual receives foster/companion care, Supervised Living or Residential Support Services and possibly Supported Home Living or Respite, it is probable that the program provider's staff will communicate and collaborate with the non-HCS service provider to integrate various aspects of service delivery. The program provider will be required to maintain a record that contains documentation relevant to the delivery of the program provider's HCS services. In cases in which the program provider provides foster/companion care, Supervised Living or Residential Support Services, the program provider must be able to respond to emergency situations 24 hours per day, seven days per week. The program provider may also be required to provide emergency services to an individual who lives in their own home or family home, as documented in the PDP. In the event that an unanticipated emergency arises and emergency services not included in the individual's IPC are required, it is expected that the program provider will be responsive to that emergency and that units are added to the IPC later (if necessary) to allow reimbursement to the provider. Program providers are encouraged to maintain frequent communication with the individuals to whom they provide services, as well as LARs and family members, to evaluate their satisfaction and to determine if changes are needed to the IP. Since case management is no longer included in the program provider's array of HCS services, it is critical to develop effective communication systems among program provider staff and that staff know when and how to contact the individual's service coordinator. For DADS employees: DADS staff must prepare for these changes in the service delivery system. All DADS staff who serve individuals who receive HCS services must be knowledgeable of how the elimination of the case management function from the program provider's array of services and the assignment of Local Authority service coordination to individuals receiving HCS services will affect the way they perform their jobs. These DADS staff must understand the concepts of person-directed planning and how to promote the acquisition of outcomes. New monitoring processes and tools will be used by the following DADS areas: - Access and Intake - Local Authority Section, Contract Accountability and Oversight Unit; Utilization Management and Review, IDD Waivers, Program Enrollment and UR; and Billing and Fiscal Monitoring - Regulatory Services - Waiver Survey and Certification [Click here](Table%201300.pdf) for a table describing many of the major changes that result from the removal of case management services from the program providers' service array and the performance of service coordination by the Local Authorities.

The LIDDA must notify the HCS participant (individual), legally authorized representative (LAR) and the HCS provider of the name and contact information of the assigned SC at time of assignment and as changes occur using [Form 8583](/regulations/forms/8000-8999/form-8583-hcs-txhml-program-contact-information), Contact Information. The LIDDA is required to have a backup system for absences of the assigned SC that designates a staff person as the contact during the time the SC is unavailable. The LIDDA enters the SC assignment into the HHSC data system and updates the assignment in the HHSC data system when the SC assignment is changed. 2120 Person-Directed Plan Development Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The SC uses person-directed planning to gather information for the Person-Directed Plan (PDP). Person-directed planning is a process that empowers the individual or the LAR, on the individual's behalf, to direct the development of a plan of supports and services that meets the individual's personal outcomes (preferences and needs). [Section 3000](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/handbooks/local-intellectual-developmental-disability-authority-handbook/3000-person-directed-plan), Person-Directed Plan, of the Local Intellectual and Developmental Disability Authority (LIDDA) Handbook instructs the SC on PDP. The PDP process: - identifies supports and services necessary to achieve the individual's desired outcomes; - identifies existing supports, including natural supports and other supports, available to the individual and negotiates needed services system supports; - occurs with the support of a group of people chosen by the individual and the LAR on the individual's behalf (for example, a provider representative, neighbor or friend); and - accommodates the individual's style of interaction and preferences regarding time and setting. In addition to understanding person-directed planning, the SC must be familiar with the HCS Program Billing Requirements to facilitate the gathering of outcome information necessary for justifying the type of supports and services to be provided through the HCS Program. Procedure for Completing Form 8665, Person-Directed Plan The SC assists the individual and the LAR to designate members of the individual's service planning team (SPT). The required members of the SPT are the individual, LAR and the SC. Any other members are identified by the individual and the LAR and may include a provider representative, a teacher, a friend or a neighbor. The SC conducts interviews with the individual, LAR, advocate, provider staff and others, as appropriate, who can provide information about the individual's desired outcomes and needs. The interviews are conducted using the probes in the PDP Discovery Tool ( [Appendix IV](https://hhs.texas.gov/laws-regulations/handbooks/hcs/appendices/appendix-iv-discovery-tool)) to guide the information-gathering interviews. The results of the information-gathering interviews identify the individual's preferences and needs, including the individual's desire to use the Consumer Directed Services (CDS) option. The preferences and needs form the basis for the individual's desired outcomes. The desired outcomes are included in the individual's PDP. The PDP must identify which desired outcomes will be met through HCS services and which will be met through non-HCS services. The SPT is responsible for documenting that the HCS services and non-HCS services on the PDP: - are necessary for the individual to continue living in the community; - ensure the individual's health and safety; and - prevent the need for institutional services. To document that HCS service components are justified*, the SC must determine that the: - type of each service component in the PDP is appropriate to meet a desired outcome or need of the individual; and - HCS service components do not replace existing supports, natural supports or other sources for the service (such as the Texas Workforce Commission for funding of supported employment services). * Note: The SC is responsible for justifying the need for each HCS service type in the PDP and the HCS program provider is responsible for justifying the amount of each HCS service type in the Implementation Plan (IP). The required minimum service coordination face-to-face contact for an HCS participant is every 90 days, but individual situations may necessitate more frequent contact. The PDP Discovery Tool, used by the SC for PDP development, assists the SC in determining frequency of contact for service coordination activities. Additional guidance and information about person-directed planning can be found in [Section 3000](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/handbooks/local-intellectual-developmental-disability-authority-handbook/3000-person-directed-plan) of the LIDDA Handbook and [Person Directed Planning Guidelines (PDF)](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/providers/long-term-care-providers/local-idd-authority-lidda/lidda-person-directed-planning). 2130 Enrollment Activities Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 Refer to [Section 13000](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/handbooks/local-intellectual-developmental-disability-authority-handbook/13000-medicaid-program-enrollment-requirements), Medicaid Program Enrollment Requirements, of the LIDDA Handbook for requirements related to enrollment activities. 2140 Service Coordination Monitoring Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The SC must conduct and document monitoring activities, including: - determining whether the individual has made progress toward the outcomes identified on the PDP; - determining whether HCS service(s) are being delivered by the HCS provider or CDS provider, as appropriate; - determining whether non-HCS services (such as Texas Health Steps-funded nursing services) are being delivered; - ensuring coordination and compatibility of HCS and non-HCS services with the HCS provider; and - determining whether the individual's health or safety is at risk in the environments where the individual receives HCS and non-HCS services and, if necessary, taking action to protect the individual's health and safety. Action may include addressing the risk with the HCS provider or notifying the appropriate authorities. If, as a result of monitoring, the SC identifies a concern with an individual's progress toward outcomes in the PDP, the delivery of HCS services, or the individual's health and safety, the SC must communicate such concern to the provider via a mechanism determined by the LIDDA and HCS provider. The SC and the provider are responsible for resolving any identified concern. If the concern cannot be resolved, the SC may report the concern to IDD Ombudsman at Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC). The SC maintains the following for an individual for an Individual Plan of Care (IPC) year: - a copy of [Form 8578](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/node/17708), Intellectual Disability/Related Condition Assessment; - documentation of the activities performed by the SC in providing service coordination; and - any pertinent information related to the individual and the services provided to the individual. Suggestions for Monitoring The SC is responsible for monitoring progress or lack of progress toward desired outcomes in the PDP and determining whether the HCS services on the IPC are being delivered. The documentation of progress or lack of progress toward desired outcomes should include references to all outcomes on the PDP. If the SC contact frequency is more often than quarterly, each desired outcome should be referenced at least once in the quarter. The SC may review information about utilized services in the HHSC data system, against the individual's IPC to help determine if HCS services are being delivered. As a result of ongoing monitoring, the SC revises the PDP, as appropriate, as the individual's preferences and needs change. The SC uses the PDP and the Discovery Tool ( [Appendix IV](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/node/64931)) as guides to determine the individual's progress toward outcomes identified in the PDP, whether HCS Program services are being delivered and whether outcomes in the PDP need to be updated. - The SC conducts interviews with the individual, LAR, family and provider staff with a focus on the individual and the outcomes in the PDP. The SC should determine if the outcomes in the PDP are being achieved or have been accomplished. The SC should also focus on whether the outcomes previously identified in the PDP are still relevant or need to change. - For an individual who does not communicate with words, the SC will need to focus on the individual's actions by spending time observing the individual in different settings and developing a rapport with the individual. In some case, the SC may depend more on interviews with people who know the individual well to make decisions regarding whether the individual is making progress toward the desired outcomes. - The SC may access the individual's record maintained by the HCS provider, but this should usually be done to clarify information that was obtained through interviews and observations of the individual. The SC does not monitor the HCS provider's Implementation Plan. 2150 Service Coordinator Role Revision 10-0; Effective June 1, 2010 2151 Individual Plan of Care Renewal Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 At least 60 but no more than 90 calendar days before an individual's IPC expires, the SC is responsible for notifying the service planning team of the need to review and update the individual's PDP. The SC should provide the LAR at least a 21-day notice that the PDP needs to be reviewed. The SPT must review the PDP to determine if the information is accurate and reflects the individual's current preferences and needs. The SC updates the PDP using instructions and forms provided by HHSC to indicate the necessary changes to the PDP. The SC must send the HCS provider a copy of the updated PDP within 10 calendar days after the PDP is updated. At least 30 but no more than 60 calendar days before the expiration of the IPC, the SPT and the HCS provider must review the PDP and develop the renewal IPC, including the HCS Program services and Community First Choice (CFC), completion of the CDS portion of the renewal IPC, if applicable, and the non-HCS services. The HCS provider is responsible for developing an Implementation Plan for the HCS services identified in the PDP and renewal IPC that will be delivered by the provider. The Implementation Plan must provide information that justifies the amount of each HCS service component on the renewal IPC. The HCS provider is required to sign and date the renewal IPC and ensure that the IPC is signed and dated by the individual and LAR. If the SC is physically present when the renewal IPC is developed, the SC signs the IPC and obtains a copy of the IPC. The SC is not required to sign the IPC before it is entered in the HHSC data system. The HCS provider is responsible for entering the renewal IPC data into the HHSC data system. The HCS provider keeps the original renewal IPC in the individual's record. If the SC is not physically present when the renewal IPC is developed, the provider is responsible for sending the SC a paper copy of the IPC within three calendar days after the HCS provider completes data entry into the HHSC data system. Within seven calendar days after the HCS provider enters the renewal IPC into the HHSC data system, the SC must review the renewal IPC in the HHSC data system. The SC can send the IPC back to the HCS provider to correct obvious typographical errors on the IPC; however, the SC must notify the HCS provider of such. If the SC sends the IPC back for an error correction, the seven calendar-day time frame begins again once the HCS provider re-transmits the IPC. The SC must review the IPC in the HHSC data system, enter their name and date, and indicate whether they agree or disagree with the renewal IPC. The foundation of the SC's agreement or disagreement is: - whether the renewal IPC is based on the PDP; - if the IPC specifies the type and amount of each service component to be provided to the individual, as well as services and supports to be provided by other non-HCS sources during the IPC year; and - whether the type and amount of each service component is supported by: - documentation that other non-HCS sources for the service component are unavailable and the service component does not replace existing supports, natural supports or other sources for the service; - assessments of the individual that identify specific service components necessary for the individual to live in the community, to ensure the individual's health and welfare in the community, and to prevent the need for institutional services; and - documentation of deliberations and conclusions of the SPT that the service components are based on the desired outcomes in the PDP and are necessary for the individual to live in the community, to ensure health and welfare in the community, and to prevent the need for institutional services. If the SC disagrees with the renewal IPC, the SC must notify HHSC and the HCS provider using [Form 8579](/regulations/forms/8000-8999/form-8579-notification-service-coordinator-sc-disagreement), Notification of Service Coordinator (SC) Disagreement. See form instructions. The SC must also notify the individual/LAR. 2152 Individual Plan of Care Revision Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The SC or the HCS provider may initiate a revision to the IPC to add a new HCS service or increase the amount of an existing service. A revision to the IPC must be done prior to the delivery of a new service or increased service amount, except in an emergency as described in [Section 2153](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/2000-service-coordination#2153), Role of Service Coordinator Related to Emergency Provisions of Home and Community-based Services and Individual Plan of Care Revision. - Whoever determines the IPC needs to be revised (the SC or the HCS provider) must notify the other. Within 14 days after notification, the SC and the HCS provider must work together to revise the IPC. - The SPT and the HCS provider must develop a proposed revised IPC to address the issue that caused the SC or HCS provider to determine the individual's IPC needed to be revised. - The HCS provider must develop an Implementation Plan for the HCS services identified in the proposed revised IPC. The Implementation Plan must provide information that justifies the amount of each HCS service component on the revised IPC. - The SPT must revise the PDP if the existing PDP does not support the service type on the revised IPC. If the PDP is not revised, the SC must document the reason for the IPC revision in a contact note. - The HCS provider is required to sign and date the revised IPC and ensure that the IPC is signed and dated by the individual and LAR. If the SC is physically present when the revised IPC is developed, the SC signs the IPC and obtains a copy of the IPC. The SC is not required to sign the IPC before it is entered into the HHSC data system. - The HCS provider is responsible for entering the revised IPC data into the HHSC data system. The HCS provider keeps the original revised IPC in the individual's record. If the SC is not physically present when the IPC is developed, the provider is responsible for sending the SC a paper copy of the proposed revised IPC within three calendar days after the HCS provider completes data entry into the HHSC data system. - Within seven calendar days after the HCS provider enters the revised IPC data into the HHSC data system, the SC must review the IPC in the HHSC data system. The SC can send the IPC back to the HCS provider to correct obvious typographical errors on the IPC; however, the SC must notify the HCS provider of such.

If the SC disagrees with the revised IPC, the SC must notify HHSC and the HCS provider by using [Form 8579](/regulations/forms/8000-8999/form-8579-notification-service-coordinator-sc-disagreement), Notification of Service Coordinator (SC) Disagreement. See form instructions. The SC must also notify the individual/LAR. 2153 Emergency Provision of Home and Community-based Services and Individual Plan of Care Revision Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If an emergency necessitates the provision of an HCS service to ensure the individual's health and welfare, and the service is not on the IPC or exceeds the amount on the IPC, the HCS provider may provide the service before revising the IPC. Within one business day after providing the service the HCS provider is responsible for: - documenting the circumstances that necessitated providing the new HCS service or the increase in the amount of the existing HCS service, including the type and amount of the service provided; and - notifying the SC of the emergency provision of the service and that the IPC must be revised. (The SC may request a copy of the documentation required in the bullet above.)

[ 4000, Person-Directed Plan ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/4000-person-directed-plan) Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 Person-Directed Planning Guidelines Person directed planning is an ongoing process that empowers an individual, and the legally authorized representative (LAR) on the individual's behalf, to direct the development of a plan of services and supports that: - identify supports and services necessary for the individual to achieve the individual's preferred outcomes; - identify natural supports available to the individual and describe needed service system supports; - occur with the support of a group of people chosen by the individual and the LAR on the individual's behalf; and - accommodate the individual's style of interaction and preferences regarding time and setting. The result of person-directed planning must reflect the essential elements of the individual's desired life in sufficient detail so the Home and Community-based Services (HCS) provider understands how to provide HCS services to meet the individual's outcomes. The Person-Directed Planning Guidelines on the Texas Health and Human Services (HHS) website provide a more detailed description of the principles of person-directed planning. See [Person Directed Planning Guidelines (PDF)](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/documents/person-directed-planning-guidelines.pdf). Discovering the Individual The individual's needs and desired outcomes are the basis for the entire process and the individual must be involved in all aspects of the process, as well as the focus. The foundation of person-directed planning is to listen, acknowledge and discover the personal outcomes, preferences, choices and abilities of the individual directing the plan. This activity is often called \"discovery.\" The local intellectual and developmental disability authority (LIDDA) service coordinator (SC) has the responsibility to facilitate the process of discovery as preparation for developing the Person-Directed Plan (PDP). There are many ways to conduct discovery. The most common method is to have conversations with the individual, LAR and others who know and support the individual, such as caregivers, close family members, current provider staff, friends and teachers. Part I of [Appendix III](/node/64956), Discovery Guide, provides guidance for effective discovery, including: - Useful communicating/listening skills; - Developing a relationship; - Creating a distraction-free environment; and - Non-verbal communication cues Other methods of are activities from: [Appendix III](/node/64956), Discovery Guide; [Appendix IV](/node/64931), Discovery Tool; and - Methods taught by [The Learning Community for Person Centered Practices](https://tlcpcp.com/)(TLCPCP). Discovery can be done using a combination of these methods. Documentation of the information gathered during discovery is important. The SC is responsible for documenting the information gathered from the individual, family, provider and other participants. Although person-directed planning is not a linear process, discovery is important preparation for developing the PDP. PDP Before developing the PDP, the SC should discuss with the individual and LAR the importance of the HCS provider being included when the individual discusses their preferences and outcomes. Since the provider will be responsible for designing and providing the services to the individual, understanding the individual's strengths, capabilities and desires is critical to providing services that are meaningful to the individual. The SC should request permission from the individual/LAR to invite the HCS provider to the planning meeting to develop the PDP. The SC should also ask the individual/LAR if they would like to invite anyone else to participate in the service planning process. The SC is responsible for convening and facilitating a meeting to develop the PDP. There is not a single way to approach developing the PDP. It can be a brainstorming session where the purpose of services and desired outcomes are discussed while HCS services are decided upon. Or, it can be a meeting in which the discovery information is presented and clarified and then HCS services are negotiated. The SC should have a thorough understanding of the services in the HCS program so that connections can be made between what the individual wants to have happen and the HCS service array. This understanding can be supported by reviewing the [HCS Program Billing Requirements (PDF)](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/documents/hcs-billing-requirements.pdf), discussions with the individual's HCS program provider and consultation with the LIDDA's HCS service coordination supervisor. Developing the PDP The PDP has two elements plus instructions: [Form 8665-ID](/node/17759), Individual Data, contains important data information about the individual that doesn't change often. [Form 8665](/node/17758), Person-Directed Plan, is the form used to document an individual's PDP. Form 8665-ID, Individual Data This page is completed by the SC at the time of enrollment and updated as necessary thereafter. The SC is required to provide the program provider a copy of Form 8665-ID: - at the time of enrollment; - when the individual transfers to a new provider; and - anytime information on Form 8665-ID is updated. Form 8665, Person-Directed Plan Pages 1, 2 and 3 are completed using the information gathered through the discovery process. These pages include: - identifying information; - method(s) of discovery; - important information about the individual; - a list of people in the individual's life; - frequency of service coordination; - non-HCS services; and - additional comments. Page 4, Action Plan: - identifies the services to be provided; - identifies the individual's preferences for service delivery options; - indicates if a backup plan is necessary for that service;* - explains the purpose and outcome of the services which address the individual's preferences revealed during discovery; - describes the relevant background information that is important to understand about the individual receiving those services; and - communicates why the services are important to and for the individual. *Note: The service planning team is responsible for determining whether an individual's waiver service is critical to meeting the individual's health and safety. The program provider must develop a written backup plan for each waiver service identified on the PDP as critical to meeting an individual's health and safety. Because HCS program providers must ensure that trained and qualified staff are available at all times for the provision of residential support and supervised living, a backup plan is not needed for these services. Backup plans for host home/companion care must be documented in the service agreement the host home/companion care service provider has with the HCS program provider. The service planning team is responsible for documenting that: - the services on the PDP are necessary for the individual to continue living in the community; - the services ensure the individual's health and safety; - the services prevent the need for institutional services; - each type of service component in the PDP is appropriate to meet a desired outcome or need of the individual; - each service component does not replace existing supports, natural supports or other sources for the service (such as Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) for funding of employment assistance services); and - the services are cost effective. Note: For an enrollment PDP, the SC is responsible for justifying both the need and the amount for each HCS service type in the PDP. For PDP renewals and PDP updates, the SC is responsible for justifying the need for each HCS service type in the PDP and the HCS program provider is responsible for justifying the amount of each HCS service type in the Implementation Plan (IP). PDP Update for IPC Renewal The PDP is treated as a new plan at the time of the individual plan of care (IPC) renewal. Although the current PDP may be used as a template for the updated PDP, the: - PDP date is updated each IPC renewal year on the top of Page 1 and on the top of every Action Plan page; and - entire document must be reviewed and updated, as appropriate, to reflect the individual's current situation and personal outcomes (e.g., an Action Plan that was discontinued in the previous IPC year is not included in the new PDP). PDP Update Within the IPC Year If an individual's PDP must be updated within the IPC year, the SC must clearly indicate what was updated. The PDP date is updated at top of Page 1 and, if an Action Plan is also updated, then the new PDP date is included on the top of that Action Plan page. New information is added at the beginning of the narrative on Page 1 (rather than at the end of the narrative). Begin the new information with the following notations: - PDP Update; - the date the new information was added to the PDP; and - name of the SC who is updating the information. Example: PDP Update, Jan. 22, 2021, Sarah Smith, SC If it is necessary to add a new Action Plan page or change information on a current Action Plan page on the PDP within an IPC year, then the SC makes the following notations at the bottom of the Action Plan page that has been updated: - checks the \"changed\" or \"added\" box and the date or the date of the decision to discontinue the service; and - enters the SC's printed name and signature. The SC must send any new or updated page(s) of the PDP to the HCS program provider in a timely manner. The HCS program provider is responsible for creating or revising the individual's IP to address the new information.

The following sections provide information related to [Form 8578](/regulations/forms/8000-8999/form-8578-intellectual-disabilityrelated-condition-assessment), Intellectual Disability/Related Condition Assessment. Level of Care (LOC) The LOC determines the individual's programmatic eligibility for the Home and Community-based Services (HCS) Program. Individuals enrolling into HCS must have an LOC I, or if the individual is transitioning or diverting from a nursing facility, may have an LOC VIII. Level of Need (LON) An individual's LON is used to determine the reimbursement rate a program provider receives for certain HCS program services. The LON is obtained by completing and scoring an Inventory for Client and Agency Planning (ICAP) assessment for each individual. A brief overview of the ICAP is provided in this document but is not intended to be comprehensive. [ 5100, Intellectual Disability/Related Condition Assessment Process ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/5100-intellectual-disabilityrelated-condition-assessment-process) Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The HCS program provider must annually renew an individual's LOC and LON by completing [Form 8578](/regulations/forms/8000-8999/form-8578-intellectual-disabilityrelated-condition-assessment), Intellectual Disability/Related Condition (ID/RC) Assessment, and entering the information into the HHSC data system. Instructions for renewing an LOC/LON may be found in Title 40, Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 9, [Subchapter D](http://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.ViewTAC?tac_view=5&ti=40&pt=1&ch=9&sch=D&rl=Y), Home and Community-based Services (HCS) Program, and the [instructions](https://hhs.texas.gov/laws-regulations/forms/8000-8999/form-8578-intellectual-disabilityrelated-condition-assessment) for completing Form 8578. - Form 8578 must be signed by one of the following people - RN, LVN, qualified intellectual disability professional (QIDP), qualified developmental disability professional (QDDP), case manager, LIDDA service coordinator (SC) or HCS provider representative. - The program provider must enter the ID/RC assessment information into the HHSC data system. - The program provider must ensure that the SC receives a copy of the signed Form 8578 within three days after data entry. Once the program provider has entered the information into the HHSC data system, the SC will have seven days to review the LOC/LON information and enter an agreement or disagreement with what was entered. LIDDAs are expected to review each ID/RC. The information entered by the program provider will be displayed in the HHSC data system for the SC to enter an agreement or disagreement and any comments. - If the SC believes the program provider made an error when entering data, the SC may return the ID/RC to the program provider for error correction. The SC will contact the program provider the same day that they return an ID/RC. - If the SC returns an ID/RC assessment to a provider, the SC must enter a comment in the HHSC data system as to why it is being returned. After reviewing the ID/RC information, if the SC disagrees with the ID/RC assessment, the SC must notify HHSC Program Eligibility Support (PES) and the program provider by completing [Form 8579](/regulations/forms/8000-8999/form-8579-notification-service-coordinator-sc-disagreement), Notification of SC Disagreement, and faxing it to HHSC PES and sending a copy to the program provider. This notification should be done the same day of the data entry. Program providers will not be prevented from entering billing because an SC does not review the ID/RC assessment in a timely manner. If the SC does not review an ID/RC assessment within seven days of data entry, the HHSC data system will automatically send the ID/RC assessment to HHSC for approval. Reports will be available for state office and LIDDA management staff noting those ID/RC assessments not reviewed by the SC. This will also be noted in the form history in the HHSC data system. HHSC PES will continue to approve or deny an individual's LOC. For an LON review, HHSC PES will complete reviews for Purpose Code 2 and HHSC Utilization Review (UR) will complete reviews for Purpose Codes 3 and 4. The SC's agreement or disagreement does not ensure any action will be taken or not taken by HHSC PES or HHSC UR. HHSC UR may contact the SC to provide additional information if an LON review is necessary. Review of the ID/RC Information from the ICAP is entered on the ID/RC (Form 8578) to request an LON for an individual. In some cases, it may be necessary for the SC to request a copy of the individual's current ICAP booklet in order to ensure that the appropriate LON has been requested by the program provider. The ID/RC assessment notes the ICAP service level (Item No. 33). The service level translates to the LON as follows: - LON 1 - ICAP service level 7, 8, 9 - LON 5 - ICAP service level 4, 5, 6 - LON 8 - ICAP service level 2, 3 - LON 6 - ICAP service level 1 The ICAP consists of two parts: the adaptive skills section and the problem behavior section. Generally, the higher the service level, the more adaptive skills the individual possesses. Exceptions exist for individuals who have more cognitive skills and limited physical abilities. The person acting as the respondent for the ICAP should be familiar with the individual's abilities. The adaptive section of the ICAP is reflected on the ID/RC assessment under \"Broad Independence\" (Item No. 31), and the problem behavior section score is noted as \"General Maladaptive\" (Item No. 32) and is scored as a negative number. A score lower than -25 (as in temperatures, -26 is lower than -25) generally indicates that the individual's behaviors are serious enough to have a formal program in place. The section rating an individual's adaptive skills is divided into four categories: - Motor skills (Can they pick up an object, pull themselves into a standing position, print their name, etc.?) - Social and communication skills (Are they able to communicate basic needs, understand simple commands, etc.?) - Personal living skills (Can they assist with dressing, use the toilet, help with household chores, etc.?) - Community living skills (Do they understand the concept of purchasing an item from a vending machine, know how to navigate in the home/neighborhood, etc.?) These items are scored 0 - 3, with 0 meaning the individual is not capable of completing the task and 3 meaning the individual is able to perform the task independently. The problem behavior section consists of eight categories of behaviors. If a behavior occurs in any of these categories, the frequency and severity is scored: - Hurtful to self - Hurtful to others - Destructive to property - Disruptive behavior - Unusual or repetitive habits - Socially offensive behavior - Withdrawal or inattentive behavior - Uncooperative behavior A program provider must have a method of addressing behaviors if they feel the behavior is severe enough to be rated more than slightly serious. A formal behavior support plan must be in place targeting any behavior noted to be very or extremely serious, and a training objective is required to address any behavior rated as moderately serious. A program provider may request an increase in LON for an individual for medical or behavioral reasons. This is one level higher than the LON assessed by the ICAP tool. [ 5200, Service Coordinator Review of Intellectual Disability/Related Condition ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/5200-service-coordinator-review-intellectual-disabilityrelated-condition) Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 For renewals and mid-cycle Level of Need (LON) requests, the HCS program provider is responsible for completing [Form 8578](/regulations/forms/8000-8999/form-8578-intellectual-disabilityrelated-condition-assessment), Intellectual Disability/Related Condition Assessment, and transmitting it to HHSC. This document consists of the individual's Level of Care (LOC) and LON. The SC does not approve or deny an individual's LOC or LON but is responsible for reviewing the document in the HHSC data system and entering whether they agree with the information. To review the ID/RC assessment, the SC must have a basic understanding of the ID/RC assessment and the Inventory for Client and Agency Planning (ICAP) assessment. ID/RC and LON Resources Additional information regarding ID/RC assessments and requesting an LON from HHSC may be found at: [https://hhs.texas.gov/doing-business-hhs/provider-portals/resources/idd-waivers-program-enrollmentutilization-review/idrc-faqs](https://hhs.texas.gov/doing-business-hhs/provider-portals/long-term-care-providers/resources/idd-waivers-program-enrollmentutilization-review/idrc-assessment-resources/idrc-faqs) [https://hhs.texas.gov/doing-business-hhs/provider-portals/resources/idd-waivers-program-enrollmentutilization-review/level-need-lon-resources](https://hhs.texas.gov/doing-business-hhs/provider-portals/long-term-care-providers/resources/idd-waivers-program-enrollmentutilization-review/level-need-lon-resources) LON Resources [ 6000, Individual Plan of Care (IPC) ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/6000-individual-plan-care-ipc) Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 All user guides are published to [Texas Medicaid & Healthcare Partnership's (TMHP's) Learning Management System (LMS)](https://learn.tmhp.com/).

[ 6100, Overview of the 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 [Form 3608](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3608-individual-plan-care-ipc-hcscfc), Plan of Care (IPC) - HCS/CFC, documents an individual's Home and Community-based Services (HCS) program services and non-HCS services. An IPC is completed at the time an individual enrolls in the HCS program and is valid for 365 days (the IPC year), as long as the individual remains eligible for HCS. An IPC must be renewed prior to the current IPC end date and may be revised at any time during the IPC year if changes are needed. A transfer IPC is completed if an individual transfers to another HCS contract or chooses a different service delivery option (meaning Consumer Directed Services is added or removed as a service delivery option). The IPC is entered in the HHSC data system. The HCS services listed on the IPC are based on the individual's person-directed plan (PDP) and must be supported by documentation in the PDP that other sources for the service are unavailable and the service does not replace existing supports, including natural supports or other sources for the service. The services must be necessary for the individual to live in the community, to ensure the individual's health, safety and welfare in the community, and to prevent the need for institutional services. See [Section 4000](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/4000-person-directed-plan), Person-Directed Plan, for more information on the PDP, and [Form 8665](/regulations/forms/8000-8999/form-8665-person-directed-plan), Person-Directed Plan, and instructions. An IPC is developed by: - the service planning team (SPT), which consists of the individual/legally authorized representative (LAR), the service coordinator (SC) and any other person invited by the individual/LAR; and - the program provider. 6110 IPC Form and Instructions Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 Review [Form 3608](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3608-individual-plan-care-ipc-hcscfc), Individual Plan of Care (IPC) - HCS/CFC, and instructions before completing the form. 6120 IPC Begin, End and Effective Dates Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 Each IPC has an IPC begin date, an IPC end date and an IPC effective date. The IPC begin date is the first day of the IPC year, the next day after the previous IPC ends. The IPC end date is 365 days after the IPC begin date. In most cases, an individual's IPC will renew on the same date every year, with leap year being the exception since the IPC is valid for 365 days, not one calendar year. (Note: If there is a gap between the current IPC end date and the renewal IPC meeting date, the provider will not be authorized to bill for services provided to the individual during that gap.) The IPC begin date and IPC effective date are the same date for an initial IPC and a renewal IPC. If the IPC is revised, the date of the IPC revision then becomes the new IPC effective date, but the IPC begin date and IPC end date do not change. 6130 IPC Meeting Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 An IPC meeting occurs when the SPT and the provider meet at the same time, either in person or by telephone, to review the individual's PDP and to discuss and identify necessary units of HCS and non-HCS services to support PDP outcomes. It is important that all parties be able to communicate and discuss openly with one another during the IPC meeting. In most instances, an IPC meeting is necessary to develop the IPC. The exceptions are for an IPC revision to increase or decrease an existing HCS service that does not require a change to the PDP and for an IPC to add/change a requisition fee only. 6140 IPC Types Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 A new IPC form is completed at designated events. The event determines the IPC type, which are: - initial IPC; - renewal IPC; - revision IPC; and - transfer IPC. The IPC types are described in the following sections. 6150 Consumer Directed Services (CDS) and IPCs Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If the individual uses the CDS option, the service coordinator (SC) is responsible for: - ensuring that the HCS program services that are self-directed are included on the IPC any time an IPC is completed; - assisting the CDS employer with developing and maintaining justification for the amount of HCS program services on the IPC that are self-directed, if requested by the employer; and - sending a copy of the completed [Form 3608](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3608-individual-plan-care-ipc-hcscfc), Individual Plan of Care (IPC) - HCS/CFD, to the Financial Management Services Agency (FMSA). If an individual only uses the CDS option and does not have a program provider, the Local Intellectual and Developmental Disability Authority (LIDDA) is responsible for entering the IPC into the HHSC data system. 6160 Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) Role Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 HHSC may review any type of IPC at any time to determine if the appropriate type and amount of services are being requested and utilized. HHSC may take action on an IPC, reducing or denying services or amounts of services if there is not documentation to support the need for the requested services. The SC may be asked to provide information or documentation. The SC's agreement or disagreement with the IPC does not ensure a specific action will be taken by HHSC Utilization Review. [ 6200, Initial (Enrollment) IPC ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/6200-initial-enrollment-ipc) Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 6210 Initial (Enrollment) IPC Overview Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The initial IPC is completed by the LIDDA before an individual is enrolled in the HCS program. A LIDDA representative meets with the individual and others who know the individual to develop the PDP. This document describes the individual's desired outcomes and is the basis for determining the HCS service components on the initial IPC. The service components and amount of each service included on the initial IPC are determined from discussions with: - the individual; - the individual's LAR (if an LAR exists); - any other persons the individual/LAR chooses to be involved; - the LIDDA representative who is completing the enrollment activities; and - the program provider selected by the individual or the LAR on the individual's behalf. 6220 LIDDA and Service Coordinator Responsibilities for Initial IPC Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 6221 IPC Meeting to Develop Initial IPC Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 After the SPT has developed the PDP, including the \"Justifications for Waiver Services and Supports\" section of the PDP, the SC schedules an IPC meeting with the provider and SPT to develop the initial IPC. 6222 Initial IPC Effective Date Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 The initial IPC effective date is the same as the IPC begin date. The IPC meeting must be held on or before the IPC effective date. Services provided prior to the initial IPC effective date may not be reimbursed. 6223 Units of Service Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The SC brings to the IPC meeting justification for units of the services identified on the individual's PDP. - Some service components, such as residential support services, supervised living and host home/companion care, are daily services and the total number of days will equal the days in the IPC year (i.e., 365). - If the individual participates in day habilitation full time (i.e., six hours a day, five days a week), the typical number of days of attendance is approximately 260. This allows for days off for major holidays and those days when day habilitation is not available for the individual. - Amounts of some services (e.g., nursing and professional therapies) may only include the number of units needed to complete an assessment, the results of which will determine the recommend number of hours/units. After the assessment is completed, a revision to the IPC can be completed. - Some services are limited in availability for individuals enrolling who are 20 years and younger because they must be accessed through State Plan Services. These services include nursing, professional therapies and dental. 6224 Non-HCS Services Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The SC includes all non-HCS services the individual is receiving (and will be receiving) on the IPC form for the initial IPC. 6225 Initial IPC Signatures and Signature Dates Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The SC signs and dates the initial IPC and is responsible for obtaining the signature and date of the provider representative and individual/LAR. The date must be the date the IPC meeting occurred. If present, the individual/LAR and SC sign and date on the appropriate lines of the form. If the LAR participates by phone, the SC checks the box to indicate such and enters the date the LAR participated in the IPC meeting. The SC then sends a copy of the form for the LAR's signature. 6226 Transmission of Initial IPC Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The LIDDA enters the initial IPC in the HHSC data system as part of completing an individual's enrollment activities. The SC ensures the individual/LAR and program provider receive a copy of the IPC. 6230 Provider Responsibilities for Initial IPC Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 For an initial IPC, the SC contacts the program provider to schedule an IPC meeting. The program provider attends the IPC meeting, participates in the development of the initial IPC, and signs and dates the initial IPC. The program provider's signature date on the initial IPC must be the date of the IPC meeting. [ 6300, Renewal IPC ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/6300-renewal-ipc) Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 6310 Renewal IPC Overview Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The rules governing the HCS Program direct the SC to notify the service planning team that the individual's PDP must be reviewed and updated at least 60 but no more than 90 calendar days before the expiration of the individual's IPC. The SC is responsible for arranging for the SPT to review and update the individual's PDP . After the SPT reviews and updates the PDP, the SC ensures that the program provider has a copy of the individual's current PDP. The provider schedules an IPC meeting with the SPT to develop a renewal IPC. Although the provider representative is responsible for completing the renewal IPC ( [Form 3608](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3608-individual-plan-care-ipc-hcscfc)), the SC is responsible for completing the portions related to CDS, if applicable, and non-HCS services. 6320 Program Provider Responsibilities for Renewal IPC Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 6321 IPC Meeting to Develop Renewal IPC Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The program provider schedules an IPC meeting to occur no later than 30 days before the current IPC end date to develop the renewal IPC. 6322 Renewal IPC Effective Date Revision 14-1; Effective June 9, 2014 The renewal IPC effective date is the same as the IPC begin date. The IPC meeting must be held on or before the IPC effective date. The IPC effective date may not be before the IPC meeting date. 6323 Units of Service Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The provider brings to the IPC meeting justification for units of the services identified on the individual's PDP. - Some service components, such as residential support services, supervised living and host home/companion care, are daily services and the total number of days will equal the days in the IPC year (i.e., 365). - If the individual participates in day habilitation full time (i.e., six hours a day, five days a week), the typical number of days of attendance is approximately 260. This allows for days off for major holidays and those days when day habilitation is not available for the individual. - Amounts of some services may be determined by an assessment completed by a licensed professional providing the service. - Some services are limited in availability for individuals enrolling who are 20 years and younger because they must be accessed through State Plan Services. These services include nursing, professional therapies and dental. 6324 Renewal IPC Signatures and Signature Dates Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The provider representative signs and dates the renewal IPC on the day of the IPC meeting and is responsible for obtaining the signature of the individual/LAR and SC. If present, the individual/LAR and SC sign and date on the appropriate lines of the form. If the LAR participates by phone, the program provider checks the box to indicate such and enters the date the LAR participated in the IPC meeting. The provider then sends a copy of the form for the LAR's signature. If the SC participates in the IPC meeting by phone, the program provider enters \"participated by phone\" on the SC's signature line, prints the name of the SC on the appropriate line and enters the date the SC participated. Then, the hard copy form is submitted to the SC for review. 6325 Transmission of Renewal IPC Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 Once the required signatures have been obtained, the provider enters the IPC into the HHSC data system on or before the IPC begin date and ensures that the SC has a hard copy of the IPC ( [Form 3608](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3608-individual-plan-care-ipc-hcscfc)) within three days after entering the IPC. 6330 Service Coordinator Responsibilities for Renewal IPC Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The SC participates in the renewal IPC meeting that is scheduled by the program provider. This is done after the SPT has reviewed and updated the PDP. The SC is not required to provide justification for the amount of HCS services on the renewal IPC; this is the responsibility of the HCS program provider. However, it is important that the SC complete the PDP in a timely manner so the program provider can develop the implementation plan. The SC is also not responsible for conducting utilization review activities. If the individual has chosen to self-direct services through CDS, the SC includes the units necessary to address the PDP outcome(s) in the CDS section of the IPC as determined by the employer. 6331 Non-HCS Services Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 The SC ensures all non-HCS services the individual is receiving are included on the IPC form. [ 6400, IPC Revision ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/6400-ipc-revision) Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 6410 IPC Revision Overview Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 Either the HCS program provider or the SC may determine that a revision to an individual's IPC is necessary. An IPC revision may be necessary due to a change in the individual's needs, a change in the type of residential services or a miscalculation of units necessary to meet the individual's needs. The provider or the SC notifies the other as soon as possible that services included in the individual's IPC must be added, deleted, increased or decreased. The provider completes a new IPC ( [Form 3608](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3608-individual-plan-care-ipc-hcscfc)) for an IPC revision in accordance with the instructions. The exception is when only a CDS service needs to be revised, in which case the SC completes the IPC for the IPC revision. The form must always include the service units for the entire year, including the services being revised. Requested units of services for an added service should be prorated, as needed, based on the time remaining in the IPC year. 6411 Provider Responsibilities for IPC Revision Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If the program provider determines that an individual's services on the IPC need to be revised, they must first determine: - if the revision reflects a PDP change, such as adding or deleting an HCS service; - if the revision increases or decreases an existing HCS service and is supported by a current outcome in the PDP; or - if the revision adds or changes a requisition fee only. Once this determination is made, the provider follows the procedures associated with the appropriate type of IPC revision as described in [Section 6420](#6420), [Section IPC Revision Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If the SC becomes aware of a need to revise an individual's IPC, the SC: - notifies the program provider as soon as possible to revise the IPC; and - schedules an IPC meeting with the program provider to discuss the reason for the revision. If only a CDS service needs to be revised, the SC meets with the individual/LAR to develop the revised IPC. If the program provider becomes aware of a need to revise an individual's IPC, the program provider notifies the SC by: - scheduling an IPC meeting to discuss the reason for the revision and to develop a revised IPC; or - submitting to the SC by fax or email a revised IPC ( [Form 3608](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3608-individual-plan-care-ipc-hcscfc)) that only increases/decreases an existing HCS service that does not require a change to the PDP. If the IPC revision adds or changes a requisition fee only, the provider does not need to notify the SC. The SC is not required to provide justification for the amount of HCS services on the revised IPC; this is the responsibility of the HCS program provider. Neither is the SC responsible for conducting utilization review activities. 6420 IPC Revision to Reflect PDP Change Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 If the IPC revision will reflect a PDP change, such as adding or deleting an HCS service or increasing or decreasing an existing HCS service that requires a new PDP outcome, an IPC meeting is necessary to discuss the reason(s) for the revision and to develop the IPC revision. Further, if the IPC revision is in response to the emergency provision of services as allowed by 40 TAC [9.166(d)](http://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&app=9&p_dir=&p_rloc=&p_tloc=&p_ploc=&pg=1&p_tac=&ti=40&pt=1&ch=9&rl=166), the provider ensures documentation supporting such emergency provision of services meets the definition of \"emergency\" in the HCS rule. 6421 Provider Responsibilities for IPC Revision That Reflects a PDP Change Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If the revision reflects a PDP change, the provider schedules an IPC meeting with the SPT to discuss the reason(s) for the revision and to develop the IPC. 6421.1 IPC Effective Date for IPC Revision That Reflects a PDP Change Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 Except for the emergency provision of services, the IPC effective date may only be on or after the date of the IPC meeting; it may not be before the IPC meeting date. For an IPC revision for the emergency provision of services, the effective date is the date of the emergency provision of services. If the IPC revision is due to a change in the type of residential services, the IPC effective date must be the date the individual begins receiving the new residential service. 6421.2 Signatures and Signature Dates for IPC Revision That Reflects a PDP Change Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The provider representative signs and dates the IPC revision on the day of the IPC meeting and is responsible for obtaining the signature of the individual/LAR. If present, the individual/LAR and SC sign and date on the appropriate lines of the form. If the LAR participates by phone, the provider checks the box to indicate such and enters the date the LAR participated in the IPC meeting. The provider then sends a copy of the form for the LAR's signature. If the SC participates in the IPC meeting by phone, the provider enters \"participated by phone\" on the SC's signature line, prints the name of the SC on the appropriate line and enters the date. 6421.3 Transmission of IPC Revision That Reflects a PDP Change Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 Except for the emergency provision of services, the provider enters the completed IPC in the HHSC data system. Within three days after data entry, the program provider ensures the SC has a hard copy of the IPC. - For the emergency provision of services, the program provider faxes the completed hard copy of [Form 3608](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3608-individual-plan-care-ipc-hcscfc), Individual Plan of Care (IPC) - HCS/CFC, to HHSC Utilization Review (UR), along with documentation of: - the circumstances that necessitated providing the new HCS service or the increase in the amount of the existing HCS service; and - the type and amount of the service provided. - Within three days after faxing the form to HHSC UR, the program provider ensures the SC has a hard copy of the completed Form 3608. 6421.4 Activity Following Transmission of IPC Revision That Reflects a PDP Change Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 The provider revises the implementation plan to be consistent with the IPC revision. 6422 Service Coordinator Responsibilities for IPC Revision That Reflects a PDP Change Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If the revision reflects a PDP change, such as adding or deleting an HCS service or increasing or decreasing an existing HCS service that requires a new PDP outcome, then the IPC revision requires an IPC meeting. In this situation, the program provider is responsible for scheduling an IPC meeting to discuss and develop the IPC revision. The SC is responsible for making reasonable efforts to be available in a timely manner for the IPC meeting. The SPT ensures the PDP is consistent with the IPC revision. 6430 Revision to Increase/Decrease an Existing HCS Service Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If the IPC revision is to increase/decrease an existing HCS service and is supported by a current outcome in the PDP, an IPC meeting is not necessary. The program provider completes [Form 3608](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3608-individual-plan-care-ipc-hcscfc), Individual Plan of Care (IPC) - HCS/CFC, in accordance with the form's instructions. The program provider obtains the individual/LAR's agreement by signature and notifies the SC of the IPC revision by submitting a hard copy of the completed Form 3608 by fax or email to the SC on the same day that the provider enters the SC's signature date on the form. (Each LIDDA and program provider should determine the preferred method of notifying the SC, either fax or email.) A phone call or voice message to the SC is not adequate notification. If the SC agrees with the IPC revision and that an IPC meeting is not required, the SC: - checks the appropriate box in the Service Coordinator Response section of the form; - signs and prints his/her name; and - returns the completed Form 3608 to the provider within two business days after the provider sent it to the SC. The SC also reviews the electronically transmitted IPC in the HHSC data system. If the SC determines further discussion is necessary, the SC contacts the program provider as soon as possible to discuss concerns. If no consensus can be reached after this discussion, the SC checks the box indicating an IPC meeting is needed and returns the completed Form 3608 to the program provider within two business days after receiving the form from the program provider. The SC is responsible for scheduling the IPC meeting to occur as soon as possible, but no later than 14 calendar days after the program provider sent the IPC revision to the SC. Specific instructions for the provider to notify the SC of the need for a revision and the SC's response can be found in the [instructions](https://hhs.texas.gov/laws-regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3608-individual-plan-care-ipc-hcscfc) for Form 3608. 6431 Provider Responsibilities for IPC Revision to Increase/Decrease an Existing HCS Service Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The program provider meets with the individual/LAR to discuss the reason for an IPC revision and obtain the individual/LAR's agreement when an IPC meeting is not held. If an IPC meeting is not held, the program provider completes [Form 3608](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3608-individual-plan-care-ipc-hcscfc), Individual Plan of Care (IPC) - HCS/CFC, in accordance with the form's instructions, indicating that no meeting is required, noting the reason for the increase/decrease and making the change(s) to the service units. (The service component(s) being revised are identified with an \"I\" or \"D\" for increased or decreased.) It is important that the program provider state a reason for the revision on Page 1 of Form 3608 and indicate which current outcome in the PDP supports the service component(s) being revised. The program provider obtains the individual/LAR's agreement by signature. The provider notifies the SC of the IPC revision by faxing or emailing the completed Form 3608 to the SC on the same day that the provider enters the SC's signature date on the form. A phone call or voice message to the SC is not adequate notification. 6431.1 IPC Effective Date for IPC Revision that Does Not Require an IPC Meeting Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If the IPC revision does not require an IPC meeting, the IPC effective date may only be on or after the date the provider notifies the SC by faxing or emailing the completed [Form 3608](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3608-individual-plan-care-ipc-hcscfc), Individual of Care (IPC) - HCS/CFC, to the SC. 6431.2 Signatures and Signature Dates for IPC Revision that Do Not Require an IPC Meeting Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The provider representative signs and dates the revision IPC and obtains the signature of the individual/LAR after discussion and agreement. If the agreement is in person, the individual/LAR signs their name and enters date of agreement. If the individual/LAR agrees by phone, the provider checks the box and enters date of agreement. The provider sends a copy of the form for the individual's/LAR's signature. The provider writes \"notified SC\" on the SC signature line, prints the SC's name and enters the date the form was faxed or emailed to the SC. (Faxing or emailing the form to the SC serves as notification of an IPC revision that does not require an IPC meeting.) Note: If the individual/LAR agrees by phone and the program provider sends a copy of the form for signature, the provider may notify the SC of the revision prior to receiving the individual's/LAR's signature. 6431.3 Transmission of IPC Revision that Does Not Require an IPC Meeting Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The program provider may enter the revised IPC in the HHSC data system after the individual's or LAR's signature is obtained on the revised IPC. If the IPC is entered and the SC determines that an IPC meeting is needed, the SC returns the IPC to the program provider in the HHSC data system during the SC's required review of the IPC. 6431.4 Activity Following Transmission of IPC Revision that Does Not Require an IPC Meeting Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If the SC responds by checking the box indicating agreement with the IPC revision, the provider revises the implementation plan to be consistent with the IPC revision. If the SC responds by checking the box indicating that an IPC meeting is needed, the provider: - follows the procedures in [Section 6420](#6420)for revising an IPC; and - deletes the IPC in the HHSC data system that is in return status. 6432 Service Coordinator Responsibilities for IPC Revision that Do Not Require an IPC Meeting Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If the IPC revision is to increase/decrease an existing HCS service and is supported by a current outcome in the PDP, the provider completes [Form 3608](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3608-individual-plan-care-ipc-hcscfc), Individual Plan of Care (IPC) - HCS/CFC, in accordance with the form's instructions. The provider notifies the SC of the IPC revision by submitting the completed Form 3608 to the SC by fax or email. The SC responds within two business days to the IPC revision by completing the \"Service Coordinator Response\" section on the bottom of Page 2 of the IPC form. 6432.1 Service Coordinator Response Section of [Form 3608](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3608-individual-plan-care-ipc-hcscfc) Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If the SC receives an IPC revision on [Form 3608](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3608-individual-plan-care-ipc-hcscfc), Individual Plan of Care (IPC) - HCS/CFC, by fax or email with \"notified SC\" on the SC's signature line, the SC immediately reviews the form to ensure: - the reason for the increase/decrease stated by the provider on Page 1 of the form is supported by a current outcome in the individual PDP; - the service type is an existing HCS service; and - the IPC effective date is in accordance with the requirements in [Section 6431.1](#6431.1). 6432.2 If Service Coordinator Agrees the IPC Revision Does Not Require an IPC Meeting Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If the SC agrees with the IPC revision and that an IPC meeting is not required, the SC: - checks the box stating such, and signs and prints their name at the bottom of Page 2 of the form in the \"Service Coordinator Response\" section; and - faxes or emails the form to the provider within two business day after the provider sent it to the SC. 6432.3 If Service Coordinator Has Concerns with the IPC Revision Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If the SC has concerns with the reason for the revision, believes a PDP update is necessary or has some reason to believe that the revision is not in accordance with the individual's/LAR's desired outcomes, the SC immediately contacts the provider to discuss concerns. If the SC and the program provider cannot come to agreement about the amount of the services or supports being requested, the SC completes [Form 8579](/regulations/forms/8000-8999/form-8579-notification-service-coordinator-sc-disagreement), Notification of Service Coordinator (SC) Disagreement, and submits it to HHSC UR. If the SC's concerns are resolved after contacting the provider and the SC agrees with the IPC revision and that an IPC meeting is not required, the SC follows the procedures described in [Section 6432.2](#6432.4). 6432.4 Service Coordinator Determines IPC Meeting is Needed Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 If the SC continues to have concerns after contacting the provider and determines that an IPC meeting is needed, the SC: - checks the box stating such, and signs and prints their name at the bottom of Page 2 of the form in the \"Service Coordinator Response\" section; - faxes or emails the form to the provider within two business days after the provider sent it to the SC; and - schedules an IPC meeting to occur as soon as possible but no later than 14 calendar days after the provider faxed or emailed the IPC revision to the SC. 6440 Revision to Add/Change Requisition Fee Only Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 If the IPC revision is to add/change a requisition fee only, an IPC meeting is not necessary and the provider is not required to obtain agreement from the individual/LAR. 6441 Provider Responsibilities for IPC Revision to Add/Change a Requisition Fee Only Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 If the IPC revision is to add/change a requisition fee only, the provider completes a new [Form 3608](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3608-individual-plan-care-ipc-hcscfc), Individual Plan of Care (IPC) - HCS/CFC , in accordance with the form's instructions, indicating that the IPC revision is to add/change a requisition fee only. 6441.1 IPC Effective Date for IPC Revision to Add/Change a Requisition Fee Only Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 The IPC effective date is the date the provider completes the form. 6441.2 Signatures and Signature Dates for IPC Revision to Add/Change a Requisition Fee Only Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 The provider representative completing the form signs and dates the form.

Note: The IPC will not be sent to the SC for review in the HHSC data system. It will go straight to HHSC for authorization. 6442 Service Coordinator Responsibilities for IPC Revision to Add/Change a Requisition Fee Only Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 The SC has no responsibilities for an IPC revision to add/change a requisition fee only. [ 6500, Transfer IPC ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/6500-transfer-ipc) Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 6510 Transfer IPC Overview Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If an individual wishes to transfer to another provider agency or a different contract within the same provider agency or change service delivery options (that is, add or remove CDS), a transfer IPC must be completed. The SC is responsible for completing the transfer IPC. The SPT and receiving provider hold an IPC meeting to develop the transfer IPC, which must include services already provided by the transferring provider as well as those to be provided by the receiving provider. See [Section 8000](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/8000-transfers-local-authority-reassignments), Transfers and Local Intellectual and Developmental Disability Authority (LIDDA) Reassignments, for specific procedures related to transfers. 6520 LIDDA and Service Coordinator Responsibilities for Transfer IPC Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 6521 IPC Meeting to Develop Transfer IPC Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 The SC schedules and conducts an IPC meeting with the SPT and receiving provider to develop the transfer IPC. The SC is responsible for completing a new [Form 3608](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/node/17455). The SC invites the transferring provider to the transfer IPC meeting, but its participation is optional. The receiving provider's participation in the transfer IPC meeting is required. The SC ensures that the transfer IPC includes all services provided by the transferring provider, as well as those to be provided by the receiving provider. 6522 Transfer IPC Effective Date Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 Except for an emergency transfer (see [Section 6525](#6525)), the IPC effective date of a transfer IPC may only be on or after the date of the IPC meeting; it may not be before the IPC meeting date.

The SC is also responsible for obtaining the signature of the individual/LAR on the transfer IPC. If present, the individual/LAR signs and dates on the appropriate lines of the form. If the LAR participates by phone, the SC checks the box to indicate such and enters the date the LAR participated in the IPC meeting. The SC then sends a copy of the form for the LAR's signature. 6524 Transmission of Transfer IPC Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The LIDDA enters the transfer IPC in the HHSC data system and faxes a copy to HHSC PES. The SC ensures that the receiving provider has a hard copy of the completed IPC [Form 3608](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3608-individual-plan-care-ipc-hcscfc). If the LIDDA is unable to complete the data entry, it sends an email to the HHSC PES contact for the receiving provider that includes the error message from the HHSC data system. HHSC PES staff will instruct the LIDDA as to how to complete the data entry. If two LIDDAs are assisting with a transfer IPC, the transferring LIDDA sends the IPC to the receiving LIDDA for data entry. For additional information on the transfer process, see [Section 8000](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/8000-transfers-local-authority-reassignments), Transfers and Local Intellectual and Developmental Disability Authority (LIDDA) Reassignments. 6525 Emergency Transfer Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If the individual has already begun receiving services from the potential receiving provider and the transfer meets the criteria for an \"emergency\" (as defined by the HCS rule, see box below), the SC: - enters the date the individual began receiving services from the receiving provider as the transfer IPC effective date; and - documents the circumstances that support the determination of an emergency transfer and faxes it to HHSC PES along with the transfer IPC. 40 TAC, \u00a79.153 Definitions (14) Emergency - An unexpected situation in which the absence of an immediate response could reasonably be expected to result in risk to the health and safety of an individual or another person. 6530 Provider Responsibilities for Transfer IPC Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 6531 Transferring Provider Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The transferring provider completes the appropriate section of [Form 3617](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3617-request-transfer-waiver-program-services), Request for Transfer of Waiver Program Services, in accordance with the form's instructions and [Section 8000](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/8000-transfers-local-authority-reassignments), Transfers and Local Intellectual and Developmental Disability Authority (LIDDA) Reassignments.

After the provider enters the IPC in the HHSC data system, the SC has six days to review it in the HHSC data system. Within three days after entering the IPC, the provider is responsible for sending the SC a hard copy of the IPC (i.e., completed [Form 3608](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3608-individual-plan-care-ipc-hcscfc)). The SC reviews the IPC in the HHSC data system by ensuring: - the information in the HHSC data system is the same as the information on the hard copy of the IPC and reflects what was discussed during the IPC meeting, if appropriate; and - that the IPC effective date is in accordance with the requirements in [Section 6323](#6323), [Section 6421.1](#6421.1)or [Section 6431.1](#6431.1), as appropriate. If an SC does not review an IPC within six days after data entry, the HHSC data system will automatically send the IPC to HHSC for authorization without an SC review. Reports will be available for state office and LIDDA management staff noting those IPCs not reviewed by the SC. 6611 Reasons the IPC is Returned to the Provider Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The SC returns the IPC electronically in the HHSC data system to the provider if the SC is unable to agree or disagree with the IPC because: - the SC did not receive the IPC hard copy within the required time frame and the SC is unable to review the IPC in in the HHSC data system before the six-day review time frame ends; - an error was made in in the HHSC data system related to a unit of service, the name of the SC (not a just minor misspelling) or a signature date; - the SC was not notified by fax or email of an IPC revision for which an IPC meeting is not needed; - the SC determined an IPC meeting was necessary for an IPC revision in accordance with [Section 6432.4](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/6400-ipc-revision#6432.4); - the SC did not participate in the development of an IPC for which an IPC meeting is needed; or - the IPC effective date is not in accordance with the requirements in [Section 6323](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/6300-renewal-ipc#6323), 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The SC must agree that the HCS services on the IPC are: - not available through other resources, and do not replace existing and natural supports; - necessary to assure the individual's health and safety and prevent institutionalization; and - based on the outcomes in the individual's PDP. 6620 Service Coordinator Responsibilities Revision 11-2; Effective March 1, 2011 6621 If the IPC is Returned to Provider Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If the SC returns the IPC to the provider, the SC enters a comment in the HHSC data system to explain the reason for returning the IPC. Additionally, the SC contacts the provider the same day that an IPC is returned and discusses with the provider how to resolve the issue. 6622 Service Coordinator's Agreement/Disagreement with IPC Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If the SC does not return the IPC in the HHSC data system to the provider, the SC completes the review by entering the agreement or disagreement in in the HHSC data system before the IPC proceeds to HHSC for authorization. 6622.1 Agreement with IPC Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The SC must agree with the IPC in the HHSC data system to move it forward for review. 6622.2 Disagreement with IPC Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If the SC does not agree with the requirements in [Section 6612](#6612), Service Coordinator's Agreement/Disagreement with IPC, the SC contacts the program provider to discuss concerns related to the HCS services in the IPC for which the SC is unable to agree. If the SC's concerns are not resolved and the SC continues to disagree, the SC completes [Form 8579](/regulations/forms/8000-8999/form-8579-notification-service-coordinator-sc-disagreement), Notification of Service Coordinator Disagreement, and submits it to HHSC UR, and sends a copy to the program provider. The SC completes the form on the same day that the SC enters the disagreement in the HHSC data system. 6630 Provider Responsibilities Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The provider ensures that the SC has a hard copy of the IPC within three days after the provider enters the IPC data into the HHSC data system. 6631 Service Coordinator Returns IPC in the HHSC Data System Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If the SC returns an IPC to the provider in the HHSC data system, the SC notifies the provider that same day of the returned IPC. Additionally, the SC enters a comment in the HHSC data system to explain the reason for returning the IPC. 6632 Activity to Address a Returned IPC Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The IPC remains in \"Returned to Provider\" status until the provider takes some action in the HHSC data system to address the returned IPC. Depending on the reason the IPC was returned, the provider may take one of the following HHSC data system actions: - delete and re-enter the IPC; or - correct any errors. Before taking HHSC data system action to send the IPC on to the SC for review again, the provider is responsible for resolving the issue that was the basis for the IPC being returned. [ 7000, Implementation Plan and Service Backup Plan ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/7000-implementation-plan-service-backup-plan) 7100 Implementation Plan Overview Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 The Implementation Plan (IP) is developed by the individual, the individual's legally authorized representative (LAR) and the program provider. The IP addresses every Home and Community-based Services (HCS) service the individual receives through the program provider. The program provider is not required to develop an IP for an HCS service provided though the Consumer Directed Services (CDS) Option. Developing an IP for HCS program services delivered through the CDS Option is a responsibility of the CDS employer. The IP must clearly illustrate how the individual will be supported in achieving his or her outcomes identified in the Person Directed Plan (PDP) and how HCS program services will be delivered to achieve the identified outcomes. The IP describes and directs the delivery of services, including when, where and by whom services will be provided. A copy of the IP is provided to the service coordinator (SC) upon request. An HCS provider may use [Form 2125](/node/17315), Implementation Plan - HSC/TxHmL/CFC, or another document that includes the same elements in Form 2125. A nursing care plan, a behavior support plan or other plans completed by HCS service providers may serve as the IP if those plans include all required elements of the IP as defined in 40 Texas Administrative Code Section [9.153(51)](https://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=T&app=9&p_dir=F&p_rloc=202304&p_tloc=14893&p_ploc=1&pg=2&p_tac=&ti=40&pt=1&ch=9&rl=153). 7200 Implementation Plan Elements Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 7210 Desired Outcome(s) Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 The desired outcome(s) for an HCS service included on the IP are taken directly from the PDP. 7220 Conversation, Observation and Formal Assessment Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 In addition to the PDP, the development of implementation strategies may be based on: - Conversations with the individual, the individual's LAR or any member of the individual's support network, and/or staff who know the individual; - Observations; and - Formal assessments (including assessments by occupational therapists, physical therapists, nurses, behavioral support specialists, doctors, dentists, teachers, speech therapists, dietitians, job coaches, etc.). Documentation must be maintained regarding the information gathered through conversation, observation and formal assessments. 7230 Implementation Strategies Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 The implementation strategies are individualized and allow for evaluation of progress in achieving each desired outcome. Strategies are the steps that contribute to reaching desired outcomes. Depending on the outcome, the IP may contain one or more strategies that lead to the individual's acquisition of additional skills or describe actions to be completed by paid supports to achieve an outcome. There is no prescribed number of strategies for each outcome. Strategies are written in observable, measurable or outcome-oriented terms. Measurable means a person can consistently and reliably determine whether an action or event has occurred. Observable means the action or event can be detected using one or more of the five senses: sight, hearing, touch, taste or smell. Outcome-oriented means that it can be determined when a desired result has been achieved. 7240 Signing the Implementation Plan (IP) Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 Once the IP has been developed, the IP must be signed and dated by the individual, LAR and the program provider to verify that they have participated in the development of the IP. 7300 Provider Monitoring of Service Delivery Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 The program provider is responsible for ensuring that services are provided according to the IP. Ongoing communication between the program provider's staff and the individual and LAR is necessary to ensure that the IP reflects services and implementation strategies that meet the needs and desires of the individual and LAR. The program provider must document services provided as specified in the implementation plan and verify the requirements for reimbursement, as defined in the [HCS Program Billing Requirements (PDF)](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/documents/hcs-billing-requirements.pdf), have been met. The IP and documentation related to service delivery may also be used by HHSC utilization review staff when determining whether to authorize the Individual Plan of Care (IPC). 7310 Example of Documenting Observable Strategies Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 Observable: Staff use one or more of the five senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell or taste) to evaluate performance on implementation strategy. Example: Johnny will independently select and purchase items using the correct amount at the local convenience store. (Based on the PDP, which reflects that it is important to Johnny to be able to go independently to the store and purchase items of his choice.) Staff Documentation: Staff observed Johnny at the 7-11. He selected three items to purchase and approached the register, greeted the cashier and received the total for his purchase. The purchase price was $3.42. Johnny presented the cashier with $3.00. Staff prompted Johnny to give the cashier an additional dollar. The purchase was then complete. This example indicates that Johnny appropriately performed many of the steps associated with making a purchase, but he continues to require assistance with determining the total dollar amount to complete the purchase. The program provider is responsible for reviewing staff documentation to determine Johnny's progress or lack of progress in reaching the desired outcome. 7320 Example of Measurable Strategies Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 Measurable: Calculations are made to determine progress on implementation strategy. Example: Johnny will use a walker. (Based on the PDP, which reflects that it is important to Johnny to be able to go from place to place without assistance.) Staff Documentation: Johnny used his walker to go a total of 25 feet this afternoon. Note: When using data sheets for measuring progress, be sure that the criteria does not \"lock\" the individual into a perpetual loop. The individual should be provided with the adequate support to reach their desired outcomes and strategies should be adjusted to assist the individual to do so. When success is not occurring, staff should note their observations on the data sheet and the program provider should assess whether the strategies remain effective. Example: Staff documented that Johnny does not appear to be motivated to use his walker inside the house. However, Johnny expressed to staff that he enjoys checking the mailbox at the end of the driveway. Staff observed that he consistently uses his walker when he is provided the opportunity to complete this task. 7330 Example of Documenting Outcome Oriented Strategies Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 Outcome Oriented: Progress is defined by occurrence of an event identified in the implementation strategy. Example: Johnny wants to participate in the annual cancer research walk/run. (Based on the PDP, which indicated that Johnny's sister died from cancer, he wants to help raise money for the cause.) Staff Documentation: Staff took Johnny to the American Cancer Society today so that he could sign up to participate in the annual cancer research walk/run. 7400 Revising the Implementation Plan Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 The program provider is expected to routinely review the services provided to an individual and share information regarding progress or lack of progress on the implementation strategies with the individual and the individual's LAR, if applicable. Lack of progress on an implementation strategy indicates that the strategy needs to be reviewed to determine if revision is warranted. The HCS program provider revises an individual's IP whenever there is a change in the outcomes identified in the PDP, or when changes in implementation strategies, or frequency or duration of HCS program services are needed. 7500 Service Backup Plan Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 A program provider must develop a written backup plan for each waiver service identified on the PDP as critical to meeting an individual's health and safety. HCS program providers may use [Form 1742](/node/17247), Service Backup Plan for HCS, TxHmL and CFC Services, to develop a service backup plan or may use their own documentation that includes the required elements of a service backup plan. A backup plan must: - contain the name of the critical service; - specify the period of time in which an interruption to the critical service would result in an adverse effect to the individual's health or safety; and - describe the actions the program provider will take to ensure the individual's health and safety in the event of an interruption to the critical service. If a backup plan is implemented, the program provider must document whether the plan was effective. If the program provider determines the plan was ineffective, the program provider must revise the plan. Note: Because HCS program providers must ensure that trained and qualified staff are available at all times for the provision of residential support and supervised living, a backup plan is not needed for these services. Backup plans for host home/companion care service must be documented in the service agreement the host home/companion care provider has with the HCS program provider. [ 7100, Implementation Plan Overview ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/7100-implementation-plan-overview) Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 The Implementation Plan (IP) is developed by the individual, the individual's legally authorized representative (LAR) and the program provider. The IP addresses every Home and Community-based Services (HCS) service the individual receives through the program provider. The program provider is not required to develop an IP for an HCS service provided though the Consumer Directed Services (CDS) Option. Developing an IP for HCS program services delivered through the CDS Option is a responsibility of the CDS employer. The IP must clearly illustrate how the individual will be supported in achieving his or her outcomes identified in the Person Directed Plan (PDP) and how HCS program services will be delivered to achieve the identified outcomes. The IP describes and directs the delivery of services, including when, where and by whom services will be provided. A copy of the IP is provided to the service coordinator (SC) upon request. An HCS provider may use [Form 2125](/regulations/forms/2000-2999/form-2125-home-community-based-service-hcs-texas-home-living-txhml-community-first-choice-cfc), Implementation Plan - HSC/TxHmL/CFC, or another document that includes the same elements in Form 2125. A nursing care plan, a behavior support plan or other plans completed by HCS service providers may serve as the IP if those plans include all required elements of the IP as defined in 40 Texas Administrative Code \u00a7 [9.153(51)](https://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=T&app=9&p_dir=F&p_rloc=202304&p_tloc=14893&p_ploc=1&pg=2&p_tac=&ti=40&pt=1&ch=9&rl=153). 7110 Service Delivery Modalities Revision 22-3; Effective Oct. 19, 2022 As appropriate for the individual and as permitted by service-specific requirements, the modalities for delivering services to an individual includes: - In person - Synchronous audio-visual - Audio only In addition to meeting service requirements, providers must defer to the needs of the individual receiving services, ensuring the mode of service delivery is accessible, person-centered, and not driven by provider convenience. Per standards of care, any professional therapy service or nursing service delivered using synchronous audio-visual technology must be clinically appropriate, safe, and agreed to by the individual receiving services or by the LAR. Synchronous audio-visual technology requires consent from the individual or LAR. Verbal consent is permissible and should be documented in the individual's record. Providers must ensure that the appropriate consent box on the IP is checked. [ 7200, Implementation Plan Elements ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/7200-implementation-plan-elements) 7210 Desired Outcome(s) Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 The desired outcome(s) for an HCS service included on the IP are taken directly from the PDP. 7220 Conversation, Observation and Formal Assessment Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 In addition to the PDP, the development of implementation strategies may be based on: - Conversations with the individual, the individual's LAR or any member of the individual's support network, and/or staff who know the individual; - Observations; and - Formal assessments (including assessments by occupational therapists, physical therapists, nurses, behavioral support specialists, doctors, dentists, teachers, speech therapists, dietitians, job coaches, etc.). Documentation must be maintained regarding the information gathered through conversation, observation and formal assessments. 7230 Implementation Strategies Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 The implementation strategies are individualized and allow for evaluation of progress in achieving each desired outcome. Strategies are the steps that contribute to reaching desired outcomes. Depending on the outcome, the IP may contain one or more strategies that lead to the individual's acquisition of additional skills or describe actions to be completed by paid supports to achieve an outcome. There is no prescribed number of strategies for each outcome. Strategies are written in observable, measurable or outcome-oriented terms. Measurable means a person can consistently and reliably determine whether an action or event has occurred. Observable means the action or event can be detected using one or more of the five senses: sight, hearing, touch, taste or smell. Outcome-oriented means that it can be determined when a desired result has been achieved. 7240 Signing the Implementation Plan (IP) Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 Once the IP has been developed, the IP must be signed and dated by the individual, LAR and the program provider to verify that they have participated in the development of the IP. [ 7300, Provider Monitoring of Service Delivery ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/7300-provider-monitoring-service-delivery) Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 The program provider is responsible for ensuring that services are provided according to the IP.

[ 7400, Revising the Implementation Plan ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/7400-revising-implementation-plan) Revision 21-2; Effective November 8, 2021 The program provider is expected to routinely review the services provided to an individual and share information regarding progress or lack of progress on the implementation strategies with the individual and the individual's LAR, if applicable. Lack of progress on an implementation strategy indicates that the strategy needs to be reviewed to determine if revision is warranted. The HCS program provider revises an individual's IP whenever there is a change in the outcomes identified in the PDP, or when changes in implementation strategies, or frequency or duration of HCS program services are needed.

Texas Administrative Code Title 40, Chapter 9, Subchapter D, requires the service coordinator (SC) to manage the transfer process as stated in \u00a7 [9.190(e)(25)](https://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&app=9&p_dir=&p_rloc=&p_tloc=&p_ploc=&pg=1&p_tac=&ti=40&pt=1&ch=9&rl=190) and (26). [ 8200, Requirement for Program Provider to Notify Service Coordinator (SC) ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/8200-requirement-program-provider-notify-service-coordinator-sc) Revision 11-1; Effective January 20, 2011 8210 Transfers Must be Planned Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) requires an individual's transfer to be planned in order for the receiving provider to be knowledgeable about the individual's needs and to be prepared to deliver necessary services. Therefore, the transfer effective date must be a future date to allow for adequate planning. An exception to this requirement may be made when a transfer meets the criteria for an emergency (as described in [Section 8230](#8230), Emergency Transfer). If an individual/LAR requests a transfer, the program provider or the SC must inform the individual/LAR or family that the transfer must be scheduled for a future date to ensure appropriate planning occurs. If an individual or LAR informs their current program provider that the individual/LAR wants to transfer to another program provider or FMSA, or the individual's current program provider receives information from another program provider or FMSA that the individual/LAR wants to transfer to another program provider or FMSA, the individual's current program provider must, within 24 hours, notify the individual's SC or the LIDDA's service coordination supervisor of the individual's/LAR's desire for transfer. If an individual or their LAR contacts a program provider and informs them of their desire to transfer to the program provider, the program provider must instruct the individual/LAR to notify his/her LIDDA or SC. The potential receiving provider must inform the individual/LAR that before the program provider can begin providing services to the individual, the SC must conduct a transfer individual plan of care (IPC) meeting and a transfer effective date must be agreed to by all parties involved in the transfer. The potential receiving program provider may not begin providing services until the transfer effective date. The potential program provider will not be reimbursed for services provided before the transfer effective date unless the situation meets the emergency transfer criteria described in [Section 8230](#8230), Emergency Transfer. 8220 No Prior SC Notification Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 If an SC is notified that an individual is already receiving services from a potential receiving program provider without going through the transfer process, the SC must document the date they were notified and the name of the person who provided notification. No more than three business days after receiving this notification, the SC must contact the individual/LAR to verify the individual requested a transfer and to confirm their choice of program provider. - If the individual/LAR says transferring was not their choice, the SC must confirm whether the individual want to remain with his or her previous program provider or select a different program provider. - If the individual/LAR says it was their decision to transfer, within five business days, the SC must conduct a transfer IPC meeting and inform the receiving program provider that the transfer effective date cannot be prior to the date of the transfer IPC meeting unless the situation meets the emergency transfer criteria described in Section 8230. 8230 Emergency Transfer Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 40 Texas Administrative Code \u00a79.153 defines emergency as follows: - Emergency - An unexpected situation in which the absence of an immediate response could reasonably be expected to result in risk to the health and safety of an individual or another person. - Emergency situation - An unexpected situation involving an individual's health, safety, or welfare, of which a person of ordinary prudence would determine that the LAR should be informed, such as: - an individual needing emergency medical care; - an individual being removed from his residence by law enforcement; - an individual leaving his residence without notifying a staff member or service provider and not being located; and - an individual being moved from his residence to protect the individual (for example, because of a hurricane, fire, or flood). In an emergency, the individual must be transferred immediately; therefore, the transfer effective date will be prior to the transfer IPC meeting date. If the SC is unaware that the individual is in an emergency situation that requires an emergency transfer, the receiving program provider must notify the SC as soon as the transfer has occurred to allow the SC to complete the transfer process. In an emergency transfer, the transfer effective date is the date the individual began receiving services from the new program provider. The signature dates on the transfer IPC will be the date of the IPC meeting. This means the transfer effective date may be earlier than the IPC meeting dates and the IPC signature dates. The SC must submit the transfer packet and documentation supporting the reason for the emergency transfer to HHSC Program Eligibility and Support (PES). HHSC PES determines whether the emergency transfer criteria is met based on the supporting documentation received from the SC. If HHSC PES determines the documentation supports the emergency transfer criteria, the receiving provider may be reimbursed for services provided before the transfer IPC meeting. 8231 Data Entry of Emergency Transfer in the HHSC Data System Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 For an emergency transfer, HHSC PES enters the transfer in the HHSC data system.

This section describes the process for suspending an individual's Home and Community-based Services (HCS) or Texas Home Living (TxHmL) Program waiver services and requesting a continuation of the suspension beyond 270 days. A program advisor in the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) Program Eligibility and Support (PES) unit will request information from the service coordinator (SC) every 30 days, or as appropriate, during the period an individual's waiver program services are suspended. The individual's services will remain suspended until it is appropriate for the individual's services to resume or the decision is made to terminate the individual's services. HHSC may request that an individual's HCS or TxHmL services be terminated at any time, if appropriate.

The program advisor completes the top section and sends the form by secure email to the SC contact at the LIDDA after an individual has been on suspension for 30 days or longer. Thereafter, the program advisor sends the form requesting a status update as often as the advisor determines is necessary while the individual is on suspension. [ 9400, Service Coordinator Responsibilities ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/9400-service-coordinator-responsibilities) Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The SC must: - immediately inform the program provider if the SC becomes aware that an individual is ineligible for HCS or TxHmL program services; - monitor the situation during the entire period of suspension; and - complete and return by secure email the [Suspension of Waiver Services Status Report](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/documents/laws-regulations/handbooks/hcs/Suspension Status Report form.pdf)form documenting the individual's current status on or before the status due date designated on the form, noting whether the suspension will continue and for how long, or that the individual is not expected to resume services (i.e., termination of services is being recommended). If the suspension continues for 270 days, the SC discusses with the individual or LAR and the program provider whether the individual will be able to resume services or if services should be terminated. - If continuation of the suspension beyond 270 days is recommended, the SC submits a request to continue the suspension of HCS or TxHmL program services for an additional 30 days in accordance with Section 9410 below. - If termination of services is recommended, the SC completes and returns by secure email the Suspension of Waiver Services Status Report form noting that the individual is not expected to resume services.

By submitting a request to terminate waiver program services, the SC is requesting that HHSC end the individual's waiver program enrollment. By signing and dating [Form 3616](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3616-request-termination-services-provided-hcstxhml-waiver-provider), Request for Termination of Services Provided by HCS/TxHmL Waiver Provider, all involved parties are indicating an agreement with the termination of services. Data Entry in the HHSC data system The program provider must complete the termination entry in the HHSC data system and the SC must review the termination entry in the HHSC data system prior to submitting required documentation for termination of waiver program services. HHSC prefers to receive required documentation for the termination of waiver program services through the [IDD Operations Portal](https://txhhs.force.com/CustomLoginPage), but it may be faxed to 512-438-4249 or mailed to: Health and Human Services Commission Program Eligibility and Support, Mail Code W-551 P.O. Box 149030 Austin, TX 78714-9030 Reasons for Requesting a Termination There are several valid reasons for requesting that an individual's waiver program services be terminated, and HHSC Program Eligibility and Support (PES) requires specific documentation depending on the reason for the termination. The required documentation for each reason is described below. Death - When the SC has learned about the death of a waiver program participant, the SC must submit: [Form 3616](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3616-request-termination-services-provided-hcstxhml-waiver-provider), Request for Termination of Services Provided by HCS/TxHmL Waiver Provider (only the program provider and SC are required to sign and date the form), and - a brief written summary regarding the circumstances surrounding the individual's death. State Supported Living Center (SSLC) - When an individual is admitted to an SSLC, the individual's program provider must place the individual on suspension of waiver program services (temporary discharge) until after the SSLC makes a recommendation regarding the individual's continued placement at the individual's initial planning meeting, which occurs within 30 days after admission. If the SSLC recommends the individual's continued placement at the SSLC, the only required documentation the SC must submit is a completed Form 3616 (the termination date on the form must be the same date of the initial planning meeting at the SSLC). Loss of Financial Eligibility (Medicaid) - The following documentation is required: - a completed Form 3616; - a written description of the service linkages in place following the individual's termination from the waiver program (if appropriate); - a copy of the denial letter from the Social Security Administration (SSA) or HHSC (if the denial letter is not available, the SC must document the reason that the letter is unavailable); and - written documentation of the following: - a statement that the option of establishing an income or resource trust may allow the individual to have his or her Medicaid eligibility reinstated was explained to the individual or legally authorized representative (LAR) (only applicable if the SSA or HHSC denial was due to excess income or resources); - the reason that the individual or LAR gave for not wanting to establish an income or resource trust (only applicable if the SSA or HHSC denial was due to excess income or resources); - a statement of whether or not the individual or LAR intends to request a fair hearing to appeal the SSA or HHSC decision; and - a signature sheet signed and dated by all involved parties as indication of understanding and agreement of all of the above. Voluntary Withdrawal - There are several reasons an individual or LAR may choose to voluntarily withdraw from the waiver program. In every instance a completed Form 3616 must be submitted. Additional required documentation is based upon the reason for the voluntary withdraw as explained below: - If the individual or LAR has selected a different waiver or program, the SC must submit a description of the services available to the individual through the other waiver or program, the reason(s) the individual/LAR stated for choosing the other waiver or program, and how that program will better meet the individual's needs. - If the individual has moved out of state, the SC must submit written documentation regarding the stability of the move (for example, where, why and with whom the individual has moved). - If the individual no longer wishes to participate in the waiver program, the SC must submit records documenting all attempts to encourage the individual's participation and the specific reason(s) that the individual or LAR states for no longer wishing to participate. - If the individual or LAR has decided to reside in a nursing facility setting although the individual is capable of being served in a community setting, the SC must submit documentation regarding the diagnosis and prognosis and the specific reason(s) that the individual or LAR states for choosing a nursing facility setting. Institutionalization - There are several types of institutionalization. In every instance a completed Form 3616 must be submitted. Additional required documentation is based upon the type of institutional setting as explained below: - If the individual is admitted to an intermediate care facility for persons with intellectual disability (ICF/ID), the SC must submit documentation regarding the specific reason(s) for the institutionalization (for example, specific behaviors), the date of the institutionalization and the name of ICF/ID. - If the individual is admitted to a medical hospital, a psychiatric hospital or nursing facility, the SC must submit documentation regarding the diagnosis and prognosis, the reason(s) the individual cannot be served in the community (for example, if the needs of the individual would cause the Individual Plan of Care (IPC) to exceed the cost ceiling, document which service(s) would cause this), the date of admission and the name of the facility. - If the individual has been incarcerated, the SC must submit documentation regarding the reason(s) for incarceration, the length of the individual's sentence, the type of facility (for example, county, federal, state), the possibility of early release (if appropriate), the original date of incarceration and the name of the facility. Individual Cannot Be Located - When an individual cannot be located, the SC must submit a completed Form 3616 and documentation of a final attempt to contact the individual. The SC must review the information available in CARE screen C63.The last screen in the C63 sequence shows the mailing address to which HHSC sends the individual's Medicaid card and the SSA sends the individual's Supplemental Security Income check. The SC must mail a letter (by both regular and certified mail) to that address as a final attempt to contact the individual or LAR. The letter must notify the individual or LAR that: - the individual or LAR has the option of transferring to a different program provider if for any reason the individual or LAR is dissatisfied with the current program provider or Financial Management Services Agency (FMSA); - if the individual or LAR does not contact the SC within four weeks after the date of the letter, a request for termination of waiver services will be submitted to HHSC; - if HHSC terminates the individual's waiver enrollment, the individual will no longer be eligible to receive the waiver services, unlimited prescriptions and possibly Medicaid; - once an individual's Home and Community-based Services (HCS) waiver services have been terminated, the individual or LAR may request that the LIDDA add the individual's name to the end of the HCS interest list; however, due to the length of the HCS interest list, an offer for re-enrollment may not be available for several years (HCS only); and - if the individual or LAR agrees to voluntarily withdraw from the waiver program, the individual may do so by signing [Form 3616](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3616-request-termination-services-provided-hcstxhml-waiver-provider), Request for Termination of Services Provided by HCS/TxHmL Waiver Provider, and returning it to the SC in the enclosed self-addressed, stamped envelope (remember to enclose a completed Form 3616 and a self addressed, stamped envelope). If the individual or LAR does not respond within four weeks from the date of the letter, the SC must submit documentation of all methods used to attempt to locate the individual or LAR and the dates of each attempt (for example, home visits, telephone calls and conversations with family members, neighbors, employers, friends, co-workers, apartment managers) and copies of all letters mailed to the individual/LAR (and a copy of certified return receipt if mailed certified). Unable to Meet Health/Safety - If an SC believes an individual's health and safety needs cannot be met by the HCS Program, the SC must contact HHSC PES for further instruction. Role of HHSC PES - Upon receipt of a request for termination of waiver program services, HHSC PES will review all documentation submitted by the SC. If the documentation is not sufficient for termination of the individual's waiver program services, HHSC staff will contact the SC for more information/documentation. If the documentation is sufficient for termination of the individual's waiver program services, PES staff will notify the individual or LAR by certified mail of the decision to terminate waiver program services and the individual's right to request a fair hearing to appeal the decision. The program provider and SC will receive a copy of the notification letter. Contact Information Questions regarding this process should be directed to the HHSC PES general email box at: EnrollmentTransferDischargeInfo@hhs.texas.gov or general message line at 512-438-5055.

After enrollment, financial eligibility must be maintained in order for the individual to continue participation in the program. Individuals eligible for certain types of Medicaid coverage are financially eligible for the program; however, not all types of Medicaid coverage ensure eligibility. There are several ways to meet the financial eligibility requirement for the TxHmL or HCS program through Medicaid certification. - Individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) from the Social Security Administration (SSA) are categorically eligible for SSI Medicaid. - Individuals in certain adoption or foster care cases through the Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) are eligible for DFPS Medicaid. - Individuals certified for Medicaid for the Elderly and People with Disabilities (MEPD), Texas Works Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and certain other Medicaid programs HHSC are eligible. Every individual certified for Medicaid benefits has a \"coverage code\" and a \"type program\" assigned to the individual's Medicaid record. The appropriate coverage code for participation in the TxHmL or HCS waiver program is \"R\" (regular Medicaid) or \"P\" (three months prior coverage); there are no other acceptable coverage codes. The only acceptable base plan is 13, except for individuals who receive Medicaid through DFPS, which does not have a base plan. There are several appropriate type programs for the waivers (see chart below).

[ 13100, Overview of the Consumer Directed Services Option ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/13100-overview-consumer-directed-services-option) Revision 10-0; Effective June 1, 2010 13110 Home and Community-based Services Available Through the Consumer Directed Services Option Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 In the Home and Community-based Services (HCS) program, the Consumer Directed Services (CDS) option is available only to those who live in their own home or family home. Individuals who receive host home/companion care, residential support or supervised living are not eligible to use the CDS option. The HCS services currently available for the CDS option are: - Transportation-Supported Home Living (SHL) - Respite Services - Nursing Services - Cognitive Rehabilitation Therapy - Supported Employment - Employment Assistance - Support Consultation When individuals select the CDS option, they are required to use Financial Management Services (FMS) and may access support consultation. Financial Management Services (FMS) are provided by a Financial Management Services Agency (FMSA) chosen by the individual or legally authorized representative (LAR). FMS includes processing payroll and payables on behalf of the CDS employer. This includes serving as the CDS employer's fiscal agent to ensure that federal, state and local employment taxes and labor and workers' compensation requirements are implemented in an accurate and timely manner. FMS also includes orientation, training, support and assistance with and approval of CDS budgets. Support consultation is an optional service that is provided by a support advisor and provides a level of assistance and training beyond that provided by the FMSA through FMS. Support consultation helps a CDS employer to meet the required employer responsibilities of the CDS option and to successfully deliver program services. 13120 Informing the Individual/LAR of the Consumer Directed Services (CDS) Option Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The service coordinator (SC) must inform an individual/legally authorized representative (LAR) of the CDS option: - at HCS program enrollment; - at the request of the individual/LAR; - at the time the individual moves out of a residential setting into his/her own or family home; and - annually if the individual is receiving supported home living or respite services. Individuals have a choice in how their services are delivered: - Agency Option - The individual/LAR chooses to have an HCS provider deliver all of their HCS Program authorized services. - CDS Option - The individual/LAR serves as the employer of direct service providers for those services chosen to be delivered through CDS. The service delivery option individuals select will be based on their own preferences, as discussed during the person-directed planning process. It is important to tell individuals that they may switch service delivery options at any time. If they select the CDS option, they can switch to the provider-managed option at any time. However, if an individual switches from the CDS option to provider-managed option, they must wait 90 days before switching back to CDS. The SC offers the CDS option by reviewing the following Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) forms with the individual: [Form 1581](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/node/17206), Consumer Directed Services Option Overview [Form 1582](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/node/17207), Consumer Directed Services Responsibilities [Form 1583](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/node/17209), Employee Qualification Requirements [Form 1584](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/node/17210), Consumer Participation Choice [Form 1586](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/node/17212), Acknowledgement of Information Regarding Support Consultation Services in the Consumer Directed Services (CDS) Option The purpose of [Form 1581](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/node/17206) is to introduce the CDS option. Form 1581 gives an overview of the differences between the CDS option and the provider-managed option. This form, when signed, provides acknowledgement that the SC has provided both orally and in writing an overview of the benefits and responsibilities of the CDS option in HCS. - If the individual chooses at this point to decline the CDS Option, the SC completes Form 1584, indicating the choice of the \"Agency Option.\" The SC does not complete HHSC Forms 1582, 1583 or 1586. - If the individual wants to know more about the CDS option, the SC continues to Form 1582. The purpose of [Form 1582](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/node/17207) is to provide more detailed information to the individual or LAR about the responsibilities assumed if the CDS option is selected. It concludes with the CDS Consumer Self-Assessment. The purpose of the self-assessment is to: - assist the individual or LAR to determine if they want to self-direct their services; and - determine what support might be needed for the individual/LAR to self-direct services. If individuals or their LARs have difficulty responding to the self-assessment questions, they will need a designated representative (DR) to help them implement the CDS option, but it is the FMSA's responsibility to assist them with appointing a DR. - If the individual chooses at this point to decline the CDS Option, the SC completes Form 1584, indicating the choice of the \"Agency Option.\" The SC does not complete HHSC Forms 1583 or 1586. - If the individual wants to know more about the CDS option, the SC continues to Form 1583. The purpose of [Form 1583](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/node/17209) is to provide important definitions of terms used with CDS. This form includes information about who can be the CDS employer, who can be a designated representative and who can and cannot be hired as an employee in the CDS option for HCS. - If the individual chooses at this point to decline the CDS Option, the SC completes Form 1584, indicating the choice of the \"Agency Option.\" The SC does not complete HHSC Form 1586. - If the individual wants to select the CDS option, the SC continues to Form 1584. The purpose of [Form 1584](/regulations/forms/1000-1999/form-1584-consumer-participation-choice) is to document the individual's/LAR's choice of service delivery option. If the individual or LAR is selecting the CDS option, the individual must also select an FMSA of his or her choice. The SC will provide a list of FMSAs serving the individual's waiver contract area. The FMSA choice lists can be found on the HHS website at https://hhs.texas.gov/doing-business-hhs/provider-portals/long-term-care-providers/consumer-directed-services/how-become-a-cds-provider. To locate FMSAs serving the individual's area, type in the county in which the individual resides. The SC may use the list of FMSAs obtained from the HHSC data system. The SC should encourage the individual or LAR to call and interview several FMSAs before selecting one. Important: FMSAs are not required to be located in the same town in which the individual resides. FMSAs provide FMS. This service does not require ongoing face-to-face contact. The FMSA conducts the majority of its business electronically, including via email or fax machine, with the individual or LAR, or designated representative if one has been appointed. The purpose of [Form 1586](/regulations/forms/1000-1999/form-1586-acknowledgement-information-regarding-support-consultation-services-consumer-directed) is to provide information to the individual or LAR regarding the availability of support consultation in the HCS Program. The use of support consultation is optional. If, during the development of the Person-Directed Plan (PDP), the individual or LAR requests support consultation, this service must be included in the PDP. During the development of the Individual Plan of Care (IPC), the number of units of support consultation must be determined for inclusion in the IPC. Support consultation includes practical skills training, coaching and assistance related to: - principles of self-determination; - recruiting, screening and hiring workers; - completing documents and assessments required to employ a person, retain a contractor or vendor, and manage service providers; - negotiating service agreements, including pricing and scheduling services, goods and items; - effective communication, decision-making and problem-solving skills to meet employer responsibilities; - tools for accessing information, resources and assistance; - contacting appropriate persons or entities based on their roles, responsibilities and eligibility related to the individual's program or the CDS option; - participating in service planning team meetings at the employer's request; and - complying with requirements of the individual's program as related to services delivered through the CDS option. A support advisor provides support consultation. FMSAs are required to make support advisors available if the service is authorized on the IPC. The list of HHS certified support advisors can be found on the HHS website [here](https://apps.hhs.texas.gov/providers/CDS/advisors.cfm). The individual or LAR may select a certified support advisor provided by his or her FMSA, or may opt to use a certified support advisor who is not associated with the FMSA. 13121 Service Back-up Plans Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The CDS employer (individual or LAR) is responsible for developing a back-up plan for each service that the service planning team identifies as critical to the individual's health and safety. During the person-directed planning process, the service planning team must identify those CDS services that require a back-up plan from the CDS employer. Critical services are defined as those that would place the health and/or welfare of the individual in jeopardy if they are not provided. CDS service back-up plans are documented on [Form 1740](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/node/17245), Service Backup Plan. The SC completes the top part of the form, indicating why a back-up plan is needed for that particular service. The CDS employer completes the back-up strategies section of the form. The CDS employer's plan must be reviewed for feasibility by the service planning team and signed by the service planning team. It is the SC's responsibility to review a CDS employer's back-up plan and determine whether the strategies are reasonable and viable contingencies exist in the event an individual is unable to receive a critical program service by their regular direct service provider. If the SC determines the strategies are not reasonable and viable, the SC may support the CDS employer as needed to develop a viable plan. The SC may also suggest the CDS employer consider using support consultation to assist in the development of a back-up plan. The CDS employer is responsible for providing the FMSA with the copy of each service back-up plan after it has been approved by the service planning team. Back-up plan strategies may include both formal and informal supports. If back-up services are to be purchased from an HCS provider, the CDS employer must include such costs in the CDS budget. In addition, persons who are paid to provide back-up services must pass all criminal history and registry checks. Funds must be allocated in the individual's budget for criminal history checks of back-up service providers. 13130 Service Planning Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The FMSA does not play a role in the HCS service planning process. Any change in the amount of a service delivered through the CDS option must go through the service planning process. HHSC may, at any time, request documentation to explain the basis upon which the amount of an HCS service on an individual's IPC was determined. If HHSC requests this documentation for a service the individual or LAR has chosen to self-direct using the CDS option, the CDS employer is responsible for providing the documentation to HHSC. The CDS employer may request support from the SC to provide this documentation for HHSC. If the individual has an HCS provider, the service planning team and the HCS provider must revise the IPC to include the change in the amount of service(s). If the individual does not have an HCS provider, the service planning team will revise the IPC to include the change in the amount of service(s). For all IPC revisions, the SC must provide a copy of the IPC to the FMSA. In contrast, a support advisor may participate in service planning meetings if requested by the individual or LAR. A support advisor must notify the individual's SC: - when support consultation service goals have been met; - if the person receiving support consultation is unable or unwilling to cooperate with service delivery; or - of the progress and status of the consumer-directed service required by the individual's program. The individual or LAR (that is, \"CDS employer\") is responsible for: - ensuring that service delivery activities address the CDS employer's goals; - developing an Implementation Plan; and - ensuring that service delivery documentation is accurate and reflects how services address the individual's goals. A support advisor may provide coaching in any of the areas listed above. 13140 Enrolling the Individual in the Consumer Directed Services Option Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 To enroll an individual in the CDS option, the SC sends to the FMSA: - a completed [Form 1584](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/node/17210), Consumer Participation Choice, within five days after the individual or LAR selects the CDS option to notify the FMSA of an upcoming referral; and - a hard copy of the completed initial proposed IPC when it is transmitted to HHSC for authorization. The FMSA needs the proposed IPC in order to conduct the required CDS orientation with the individual or LAR before services delivered via the CDS option can begin. Several key activities must occur before service delivery begins. The FMSA will: - explain the hiring process to the employer, including the required criminal history, registry and Medicaid exclusion checks; - ensure that the employer understands who can and cannot be hired to provide CDS services; - work with the employer to develop the draft CDS budget, which includes the hours direct service providers will work, wage rate and benefits for each employee hired and project expenditures for employer services and supports, including support consultation if included on the IPC (the draft CDS budget is based on the proposed IPC); and - explain that service delivery documentation must relate back to the goals identified and documented on the PDP. The FMSA will need to know the number of hours of CDS services on the proposed IPC in order to assist the employer with development of the CDS budget. The FMSA conducts the CDS orientation while the proposed IPC is under utilization review by HHSC. When the orientation has been completed the FMSA is required to notify the SC via HHSC [Form 2067](/regulations/forms/2000-2999/form-2067-case-information), Case Information. The SC files the form in the individual's record. Services delivered through the CDS option may not begin until: - the CDS orientation has been completed; - direct service provider eligibility has been determined and verified by the FMSA; - the service provider agreement(s) has been signed; - the CDS budget has been approved by the FMSA; and - the IPC has been authorized in the HHSC data system. The FMSA will not allow service delivery to begin until it is notified by HHSC that services are authorized in the HHSC data system. In the event that the number of hours authorized for SHL or Respite changes as a result of HHSC utilization review, the SC will notify the FMSA of the change by sending Form 2067 to the FMSA. 13150 Entering Consumer Directed Services on the Individual Plan of Care Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 FMSAs do not have access to enter information into HHSC data system. If the individual has an HCS provider, the HCS provider is responsible for entering into the HHSC data system the individual's IPC data, including the individual's CDS and FMSA services. If the individual does not have an HCS provider, the SC is responsible for entering into the HHSC data system the individual's IPC data, which are the individual's CDS and FMSA services. Financial Management Services For individuals who use the CDS option, the IPC must include FMS. FMS is authorized as a monthly service. For example, for a 12-month period, 12 units of FMS must be included on the IPC. Support Consultation If the individual or LAR requests support consultation or the individual's service planning team determines that support consultation would be beneficial to provide employer coaching, hours for support consultation must also be included on the IPC. Support consultation is to be used as needed. On average, an individual may be authorized for six to nine hours of support consultation per year. It is not the type of service to be used on a weekly basis. Note: An HCS provider is not responsible for delivering or billing for a service delivered through the CDS option. 13160 Monitoring Consumer Directed Services Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 The SC monitors CDS services in the same manner as non-HCS services. A key monitoring role is to determine whether the individual's health and safety is at risk in the environments in which the individual receives HCS and non-HCS services and, if necessary, to take action to protect the individual's health and safety. This includes terminating the CDS option, if using CDS puts the individual's health and safety at risk. If the SC learns of a problem with the FMSA, the SC may report the FMSA to the IDD Ombudsman at HHSC. The FMSA is required to provide the SC and employer quarterly reports of expenditures for each CDS service. The purpose of these reports is to determine over or under utilization of services. The FMSA will also note any areas of non-compliance with the CDS option on the quarterly report. 13170 Corrective Action Plans Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 Based on review of the quarterly reports or a monitoring visit, the SC may request a corrective action plan from the employer. It is important to remember that it is the employer's responsibility to ensure that services are delivered, that service goals are being met and that program rules are being followed. At the request of the SC or the FMSA, the CDS employer must develop a corrective action plan using HHSC [Form 1741](/regulations/forms/1000-1999/form-1741-corrective-action-plan), Corrective Action Plan. The person requesting the corrective action plan completes the top part of the form indicating the specific reason a corrective action plan is needed (for example, over expenditure or failure to submit required documentation to the FMSA in a timely manner). The CDS employer completes the corrective action strategies section of the form. The CDS employer must provide written corrective action plans to the person requiring the plan within 10 calendar days after receiving the request. The CDS employer's plan must be reviewed for feasibility and signed by the service planning team. It is the SC's responsibility to review a CDS employer's corrective action plan to determine whether the resolution proposed in the plan represents a reasonable and viable solution to the identified problem. If the SC determines the resolution proposed in the plan is not a reasonable and viable solution to the identified problem, the SC may support the CDS employer as needed to develop a viable plan. The SC may also suggest the CDS employer consider using support consultation to assist in the development of a corrective action plan. Corrective action plan information needs to be specific to the identified issue and identify specific strategies and time frames for improvement. The goal of a corrective action plan is to focus on needed supports to ensure the employer succeeds in using the CDS option. 13180 Termination from the Consumer Directed Services Option Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 An individual or LAR may voluntarily request to switch from the CDS option to the agency option (see [Section 8600](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/8600-cdsa-transfer-changing-service-delivery-option), FMSA Transfer and Changing Service Delivery Option). An individual must remain with the agency option for at least 90 days before requesting to transfer back to the CDS option. The service planning team may recommend the individual be involuntarily terminated from the CDS option. For an individual participating in CDS, the SC must recommend that HHSC terminate the individual's participation in the CDS option if the SC determines that: - the individual's continued participation in CDS poses a significant risk to the individual's health, safety or welfare; - the individual or LAR has not complied with the CDS rules in Title 40, Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 41, [Subchapter B](http://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.ViewTAC?tac_view=5&ti=40&pt=1&ch=41&sch=B&rl=Y)(relating to Responsibilities of Employers and Designated Representatives); or - the employer failed to implement a corrective action plan within required time frames. To recommend that HHSC terminate an individual's participation in the CDS option, the SC: - initiates a change in the individual's service delivery option by following the activities described in Sections 8620-8660, as appropriate to the individual's situation; and - submits a written request to HHSC using [Form 3611](/regulations/forms/3000-3999/form-3611-involuntary-termination-consumer-directed-services-ipc-cover-sheet), Involuntary Termination of Consumer Directed Services (CDS) Individual Plan of Care (IPC) Cover Sheet, and include: - a description of the service component(s) recommended for termination; - a statement of the reasons why termination is recommended, including failure by the employer to implement the CDS corrective action plan (HHSC [Form 1741](/regulations/forms/1000-1999/form-1741-corrective-action-plan), Corrective Action Plan); - a copy of the CDS corrective action plan (Form 1741) describing the employer's attempts to resolve the issues before termination was recommended; and - a copy of the revised IPC. The SC will notify the FMSA (using [Form 2067](/regulations/forms/2000-2999/form-2067-case-information), Case Information) that a request to terminate the CDS option has been sent to HHSC for approval. 13190 Service Delivery Transfers from one Consumer Directed Services Agency to Another Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 Refer to [Section 8600](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/8600-cdsa-transfer-changing-service-delivery-option), FMSA Transfer and Changing Service Delivery Option, when an individual requests to change FMSAs.

LTCR conducts initial certification and annual recertification surveys for contracts operated by program providers. In addition to these surveys, LTCR also completes residential visits for Host Home/Companion Care and three- and four-person residences in the HCS program. LTCR also reviews complaints and deaths in the HCS, TxHmL, and Deaf Blind with Multiple Disabilities (DBMD) waiver programs and follows up on abuse, neglect and exploitation (ANE) allegations related to individuals served in the HCS and TxHmL waiver programs. [ 14200, Home and Community-based Services Surveys ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/14200-home-community-based-services-surveys) Revision 22-1; Effective February 4, 2022 In accordance with Title 40, Texas Administrative Code (TAC), Chapter 9, [Subchapter D](http://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.ViewTAC?tac_view=5&ti=40&pt=1&ch=9&sch=D&rl=Y), \u00a79.171(a), all HCS program providers must be in continuous compliance with the HCS program certification principles. (See \u00a7\u00a79.172-9.175 and \u00a7\u00a79.177-9.180.) In accordance with 40 TAC, Chapter 9, Subchapter D, \u00a79.171(d), LTCR may conduct an intermittent survey of HCS program providers at any time to ensure compliance with the HCS program certification principles. 14210 Types of Surveys Revision 22-1; Effective February 4, 2022 LTCR conducts certification surveys of HCS program providers, at least annually, to evaluate evidence of the program provider's compliance with certification principles. Initial Certification Survey After a program provider has obtained a provisional contract with HHSC, LTCR conducts an initial certification survey within 120 days after the date HHSC approves the enrollment or transfer of the first individual to receive HCS program services from the program provider under the provisional contract. Recertification Survey An HCS program provider's certification period is no more than 365 calendar days and must be renewed annually before the expiration of the current certification period. The program provider must demonstrate compliance with all certification principles to be certified for another 365-day period. If the program provider is out of compliance with any certification principles, LTCR will send a final report with a list of violations to the program provider within 14 calendar days after the day of exit. The program provider must submit a plan of correction (PoC) within 14 calendar days of receipt of the report to demonstrate the actions the program provider will implement to demonstrate compliance. Follow-Up Survey, Vendor Hold and Denial of Certification If LTCR determines at the end of a survey that a program provider is not in compliance with one or more of the certification principles that results in a violation, LTCR will require the program provider to develop and submit an acceptable PoC. For a critical violation, the PoC must include that corrective action will be completed within 30 calendar days after the date of the survey exit conference. An on-site follow-up survey will be conducted after the 30-day period to determine if the program provider completed the corrective action in accordance with their PoC. For a violation that is not critical, the PoC must include that corrective action will be completed within 45 calendar days after the date of the survey exit conference. An on-site follow-up survey will be conducted after the 45-day period to determine if the program provider completed the corrective action in accordance with their PoC. If LTCR determines that the program provider has not completed the corrective action or they have failed to submit an acceptable PoC, HHSC imposes a vendor hold against the program provider or denies or terminates the certification. If a vendor hold is imposed for a program provider with a provisional contract, HHSC will initiate termination of the program provider's contract in accordance with Texas Administrative Code (TAC) \u00a7 [49.534](http://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&app=9&p_dir=&p_rloc=&p_tloc=&p_ploc=&pg=1&p_tac=&ti=40&pt=1&ch=49&rl=534), Termination of Contract by HHSC. If a vendor hold is imposed for a program provider with a standard contract, LTCR will conduct a survey at least 31 calendar days after the effective date of the vendor hold to determine if the program provider completed the corrective action required to release the vendor hold. If the program provider completed the corrective action, HHSC will release the vendor hold. If the program provider has not completed the corrective action, HHSC will deny or terminate the certification. See 40 TAC, Chapter 9, [Subchapter D](http://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.ViewTAC?tac_view=5&ti=40&pt=1&ch=9&sch=D&rl=Y), \u00a79.183, Program Provider Compliance and Corrective Action. Intermittent Surveys Intermittent surveys are always unannounced and conducted at the discretion of LTCR. These surveys are based on: - complaints; - follow up to abuse, neglect or exploitation (ANE) allegations; - deaths; - ANE Trending Report; - residential visits; or - internal HHSC referrals. 14220 Overview of the Home and Community-based Services Certification Survey Process Revision 22-1; Effective February 4, 2022 LTCR may conduct unannounced certification surveys or on-site visits at any time. When the survey team lead contacts the HCS program provider of an upcoming initial certification or recertification survey, the team lead will send a copy of the Provider Information Request form to the program provider. The team lead will also send [Form 8576](/regulations/forms/8000-8999/form-8576-individual-profile-information), Individual Profile Information, to the HCS program provider with a date for the information to be completed and returned to the survey team lead. Entrance Conference At the beginning of every initial or recertification survey, the LTCR survey team will conduct an entrance conference with the program provider and any program staff who are present. The LTCR survey team lead will explain the survey process. The survey team will review a sample of 10% or more of the individuals in the HCS program provider's contract. The team uses standardized checklists to ensure that all principles are reviewed for compliance. These checklists can be found on the HCS Provider Portal. Certification survey activities include, but are not limited to: - interviewing individuals, family members, Legally Authorized Representatives (LARs), service providers and staff; - visiting residences and day habilitation sites; - reviewing individuals' records (including medical records); - reviewing personnel and staff training records; - reviewing financial records of the individuals for which the program provider handles finances; - reviewing complaint information, satisfaction surveys and Consumer Advocate Advisory Committee (CAAC) meeting minutes; - reviewing information regarding any deaths, discharges (permanent or temporary) and allegations of abuse, neglect and exploitation; - reviewing fire drills and emergency evacuation plans, as well as four-person residence approvals and fire marshal inspections for four-person residences; and - reviewing critical incident data, restraints and restrictive behavior support plans. The survey team will hold a final debriefing at the end of the survey. The program provider is allowed to submit evidence to show compliance prior to the exit conference. Exit Conference LTCR conducts an exit conference at the end of all surveys, at a time and location determined by HHSC. LTCR gives the program provider a written statement of concern, Form 3701, Preliminary Findings Based on Survey, Inspection or Investigation, at the exit conference. Note: If the survey team identifies an immediate threat, the program provider is expected to immediately provide the survey team with a plan of removal. If the immediate threat cannot be eliminated, HHSC will deny certification and coordinate with the local intellectual and developmental disability authority (LIDDA) for the immediate provision of alternative services for the individuals. Informal Dispute Resolution If a program provider disagrees with the survey results, they may request an informal dispute resolution (IDR). The IDR process is an informal process by which a program provider can dispute, before an independent third party, the findings on which a violation is based. The outcome of the IDR serves as the independent third party's recommendation to HHSC regarding the program provider's compliance or noncompliance with program rules. Information about the IDR process is found in [Provider Letter 2021-07](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/documents/providers/communications/2021/letters/PL2021-07.pdf). Note: The program provider must still submit an acceptable PoC no later than 14 calendar days after receiving Form 3724, Statement of Licensing Violations and Plan of Correction, from HHSC even if the program provider chooses to use the IDR process. 14230 Plan of Correction (PoC) Revision 22-1; Effective February 4, 2022 Within 14 calendar days after receiving the final survey report, the program provider must submit a PoC to address each violation that was identified during the survey. This applies even if the provider disagrees with the findings of violations or requests an informal dispute resolution (IDR). For violations that are critical, the PoC must include the corrective action(s) the program provider will take for each violation. The PoC must also have a completion date within 30 calendar days from the survey exit date. For violations that are noncritical, the PoC must include the corrective action(s) the program provider will take for each violation. The PoC must have a completion date within 45 calendar days from the survey exit date. HHSC will review the PoC and the program provider will be notified in writing whether the plan has been approved or denied. If the plan is denied, the program provider must submit a revised plan within five business days of request for a revised PoC. Once the plan is approved, HHSC will request that the program provider submit evidence of the correction to HHSC and HHSC may conduct a follow-up survey to verify the corrections. [ 14300, Texas Home Living Certification Surveys ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/14300-texas-home-living-certification-surveys) Revision 22-1; Effective February 4, 2022 In accordance with 40 TAC, Chapter 9, [Subchapter N](http://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.ViewTAC?tac_view=5&ti=40&pt=1&ch=9&sch=N&rl=Y), \u00a79.576(a), all TxHmL program providers must be in continuous compliance with the TxHmL Program certification principles. (See \u00a7\u00a79.578-9.580 and \u00a7\u00a79.584-9.585.) Per 40 TAC, Chapter 9, Subchapter N, \u00a79.576(d), LTCR may conduct an intermittent survey of TxHmL program providers at any time to ensure compliance with the TxHmL program certification principles. [ 14400, Residential Visits ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/14400-residential-visits) Revision 22-1; Effective February 4, 2022 Effective Sept. 1, 2009, the 81st Texas Legislature, Regular Session, required HHSC to conduct annual unannounced inspections of HCS three- and four-person residences. In accordance with 40 TAC, Chapter 9, [Subchapter D](http://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.ViewTAC?tac_view=5&ti=40&pt=1&ch=9&sch=D&rl=Y), \u00a79.171(k), HHSC LTCR conducts annual unannounced visits to each residence in which Residential Support Services or Supervised Living is provided and may conduct unannounced visits to each residence in which Host Home/Companion Care services are provided. These visits are completed to verify that these residences offer environments that comply with [Form 3609](/node/17456), Waiver Survey and Certification Residential Checklist. 14410 Residential Visit Policy and Procedures Revision 22-1; Effective February 4, 2022 Upon arrival at the residence, LTCR staff will present their HHSC identification to the Host Home/Companion Care provider or the staff at the three-person or four-person residence and explain the reason for the visit. If the LTCR staff arrives at a residence in which no one speaks English and the LTCR staff is unable to speak the language of the people living in the residence, the LTCR staff member will secure interpreting services through HHSC to assist with interpreting for the Host Home/Companion Care provider or staff at the three- or four-person residence. See Information Letter 2009-99 at: [https://www.hhs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/documents/providers/communications/2009/letters/IL2009-99.pdf](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/documents/providers/communications/2009/letters/IL2009-99.pdf). LTCR staff use [Form 3609](/node/17456), Waiver Survey and Certification Residential Checklist, to conduct each residential visit. Each item on the checklist will be marked pass, fail or not applicable (N/A). Some of the checklist items require interviewing the supervised living staff, residential support staff or the Host Home/Companion Care service provider to assess knowledge of the specific needs of the individual(s) in the residence and to confirm training on areas such as abuse, neglect and exploitation (ANE), emergency plans, medications, behavior support plans and other required service provision areas. LTCR staff may take photographs to substantiate identified concerns, when appropriate. [Provider Letter 2020-01](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/documents/providers/communications/2020/letters/PL2020-01.pdf) provides information for how the Host Home/Companion Care provider or HCS provider can give feedback about a residential visit. If the Address in the HHSC Data System is Invalid If LTCR staff arrive at a residence that is no longer associated with the HCS program, or cannot find the address provided for a location code in the HHSC data system, LTCR staff will fill out [Form 3609](/node/17456) noting the incorrect address. A letter notifying the program provider of the inaccuracy in the HHSC data system will be sent to the program provider. If No One is Home If LTCR staff finds no one at the residence after two attempts to visit, LTCR staff contacts the program provider to find out when the residential service provider is most likely to be home. LTCR staff may call Host Home/Companion Care service providers to verify times of the week that they will be available for a residential visit. If LTCR Staff are Not Allowed to Access the Residence If LTCR staff are not allowed access to a three-person or a four-person residence or a Host Home/Companion Care residence, LTCR staff will notify the program provider for a resolution. It is the program provider's responsibility to ensure that regular or contracted employees cooperate with the residential visit process. 14411 Residential Visit Results Revision 22-1; Effective February 4, 2022 Calculating the Score from a Residential Visit A program provider receives a score as a result of a residential visit. - A program provider's score for a visit is calculated by deducting the following from 100 points (the total points on the Residential Review Checklist): - the total points for items on the checklist that are marked \"fail\" during the visit; and - ten points for each significant risk identified during the visit. - The value of each item on a checklist is calculated by dividing 100 points by the number of items on the checklist that are applicable to the visit. Example: A residential visit of a program provider is conducted, and there are 30 items on the checklist that are applicable to the visit. During the visit, three items on the checklist are marked \"fail,\" and two significant risks are identified. - The value of each item on the checklist is calculated as follows: - 100 points \u00f7 30 applicable items = 3.33 points/item - The program provider's score is calculated as follows: - 100 points - [(3 items marked fail x 3.33) + (2 significant risks x 10)] = - 100 - [9.99 + 20] = - 100 - 29.99 = - 70.01 (Score) No Evidence of Correction Required and No Follow-Up Action Taken If a program provider has no items marked \"fail\" on the Residential Review Checklist, LTCR does not require evidence of correction (EoC) to be submitted and does not conduct follow-up activities. No Evidence of Correction Required but Follow-Up Action Taken If a program provider receives a score of 90 or above and there is no significant risk identified during the residential visit, LTCR does not require an EoC to be submitted. At the next residential visit, LTCR examines the items marked \"fail\" at the previous visit and requires an EoC for any of those items that have not been corrected. If the program provider does not submit an EoC as required, or LTCR does not approve the EoC, LTCR may conduct an intermittent survey in accordance with 40 TAC \u00a79.171(l). Evidence of Correction Required If a program provider receives a score below 90 or there is an identified significant risk, LTCR requires an EoC for all items marked \"significant risk\" or \"fail.\" LTCR also requires the program provider to take action for an identified significant risk, as described below. If the program provider does not submit an EoC as required, or LTCR does not approve the EoC, LTCR may conduct an intermittent survey in accordance with 40 TAC \u00a79.171(l)(4). A program provider must submit an EoC to LTCR using the WSC Portal or by submitting [Form 1573](/regulations/forms/1000-1999/form-1573-residential-review-evidence-correction), Residential Review Evidence of Correction. If using Form 1573, the Residential Review ID must be listed on the form with accompanying evidence. The time frame to submit the EoC is included in the documentation received by the program provider. LTCR will not accept an EoC without the correct Residential Review ID. Significant Risk Identified A significant risk is an act or failure to act by the program provider that could have a major adverse effect on the health, safety or welfare of one or more individuals, including emotional or physical harm, or death. If LTCR determines that an item marked \"fail\" on the Residential Review Checklist results in a significant risk, LTCR requires the program provider to take action. - If LTCR concludes that the significant risk requires immediate corrective or mitigating action, such as locking up hazardous chemicals or securing a copy of the residence's emergency plan, LTCR staff will not leave the residence until the program provider has taken immediate action and the significant risk is removed. - LTCR will also contact the persons identified in the HHSC data system as the \"program provider contract contacts\" (the HCS provider or a representative of the HCS provider) and informs such persons of the date, as determined by LTCR, by which the program provider must submit evidence of correction showing that action has been taken and the significant risk removed. [ 14500, Death Reviews ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/14500-death-reviews) Revision 22-1; Effective February 4, 2022 See also [Section 17000](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/laws-regulations/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/hcs-section-17000-critical-incident-death-reporting), Critical Incident and Death Reporting. In accordance with 40 TAC, Chapter 9, [Subchapter D](http://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.ViewTAC?tac_view=5&ti=40&pt=1&ch=9&sch=D&rl=Y), \u00a79.178(r), and 40 TAC, Chapter 9, Subchapter N, \u00a79.580(l), HCS and TxHmL program providers must report the death of an individual in their program to HHSC and the service coordinator by the end of the next business day following the death or the program provider's learning of the death. [Form 8493](/regulations/forms/8000-8999/form-8493-notification-regarding-a-death-hcs-txhml-dbmd-programs), Notification Regarding a Death in HCS, TxHmL and DBMD Programs, must be faxed to LTCR at 512-206-3999 or submitted through the WSC Portal. The Risk Assessment coordinators (RACs) collect specific information regarding the death from the program provider and may request additional records, depending on the conditions existing at the time of death. The Death Review Group (DRG) meets routinely to review the circumstances surrounding each death. Additional regulatory follow up, including an on-site visit, may be scheduled to evaluate the program provider's compliance with HCS or TxHmL certification principles as the result of the DRG review. 14510 Death Review Policy and Procedures Revision 22-1; Effective February 4, 2022 As part of the death review, the Risk Assessment coordinators (RACs) collect the following information: - Date of death; - Provider contract number and component code; - Person reporting the death, including contact telephone, email address and fax number; - Individual's identification number in the HHSC data system; - Type of setting HCS, Texas Home Living (TxHmL) or Deaf Blind with Multiple Disabilities (DBMD); - Cause of death; - Date provider notified of death; - Admission date to the provider; - Dates of hospitalizations in the last three months (if applicable); - Dates of hospice (if applicable); - If the Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) Statewide Intake was notified; - Types of residence (Host Home/Companion Care, 3-Person, 4-Person, Own Home or Family Home); - Place of death; - Type of death (expected, unexpected, or accident); - Description of events surrounding the death; and - If an autopsy was ordered. Information Gathering If abuse or neglect is suspected in relation to the death of the individual, the RAC will immediately contact DFPS Statewide Intake. Requests for Additional Information The following records may be requested by the RAC for specified time frames, depending on the conditions existing at the time of death. - Most recent person directed plan and implementation plan(s); - Any training regarding the individual's special needs provided to service providers; - Last two months of medication administration records; - Most current nursing assessment; - Last three months of nursing notes, physician orders and lab work; - Last three weeks of residential support services, supervised living, Community First Choice personal assistance services/habilitation, supported home living, community support or host home/companion care notes; - Last week of day habilitation notes; - State supported living center transition notes (if applicable); - Hospice notes (if applicable); and - RN/LVN names/signature sample key. Additional documents may be requested after the initial review by the RAC nurse. Suspicious Deaths If any circumstances surrounding the death are suspicious, LTCR may take further actions, including, but not limited to, referral to local police departments and DFPS Statewide Intake, completion of an intermittent survey or referral to pursue contract actions. The regional director or assistant director is informed immediately of suspicious circumstances surrounding a death or if other issues of concern are noted. Follow-up Activities RACs may conduct a desk review based on the information received from the program provider, requested records and/or the information received from HHSC Provider Investigations (PI). The RAC manager may recommend an on-site visit based on the circumstances of the death, information obtained from a desk review or information obtained from HHSC PI. If the survey team determines that the program provider is not in compliance with one or more of the certification principles during an on-site visit, an intermittent survey will be opened. [ 14600, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation Follow Up ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/14600-abuse-neglect-exploitation-follow) Revision 22-1; Effective February 4, 2022 The Risk Assessment coordinator (RAC) team receives investigative reports related to allegations of abuse, neglect or exploitation of individuals who receive HCS, TxHmL or ICF/IID program services. The reports are reviewed by RACs to determine whether regulatory follow-up is required. Additional documentation may be requested from the program provider to verify that the program provider responded to the allegation of abuse, neglect and exploitation according to program standards. In addition, an on-site visit may be scheduled. 14610 Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation Policy and Procedures Revision 22-1; Effective February 4, 2022 The final HHSC Provider Investigations (PI) report is reviewed by RACs to determine if/or what actions need to be taken by LTCR Survey Operations. Actions to be taken are determined by: - the severity of the allegation; - the disposition of the allegation; - the concerns/recommendations of the investigator; and - indicators of noncompliance noted by the RACs during the review of the final report narrative. HHSC sends a final report to the program provider, unless the administrator and the secondary designee are the alleged perpetrator. The program provider has 14 calendar days from the receipt of the investigation findings to notify the RACs of its response to the findings by submitting [Form 8494](/regulations/forms/8000-8999/form-8494-notification-regarding-investigation-abuse-neglect-or-exploitation), Notification Regarding an Investigation of Abuse, Neglect or Exploitation, in HCS and TxHmL programs, by fax to 512-206-3999 or through the WSC Portal. Form 8494 should include: - the program provider name; - contract number; - component code; - date submitted to LTCR; - who submitted the form, as well as area code and phone number and fax; - DFPS case number; - date the DFPS report was received; - HHSC data system ID number; - date of allegation; - type of allegation; - disposition of allegation; - concurrence with the disposition; - what actions were taken by the provider; and - if the provider will be requesting a methodological review or a review of the finding. The program provider is responsible for attaching documentation when submitting Form 8494 to include a response for how the program provider handled any confirmed allegations or HHSC concerns or recommendations. One of the following actions is taken by LTCR: - Desk review - A desk review is conducted if there is low risk to the individual(s). The determination of low risk is made if the allegation does not pose a risk to the health or safety of the individual(s) served. - On-site visit - On-site visits are conducted if it is determined that a significant risk exists for one or more individuals. [ 14700, Additional Monitoring Related to Risk Factors ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/14700-additional-monitoring-related-risk-factors) Revision 22-1; Effective February 4, 2022 Each quarter, RACs compile a quarterly trending report for all HCS and TxHmL waiver contracts. This risk factor report includes: - number of confirmed abuse/neglect/exploitation allegations entered into the abuse/neglect database that meet or exceed 5% of all confirmed findings out of the total number of allegations for contract; - number of complaints entered into the complaint database; and - number of deaths of individuals entered into the death database. The RACs assess the circumstances related to the identified contracts reflected in this report for two quarters in the last calendar year. If they identify patterns or trends that indicate a possible increased risk to the health, safety or welfare of the individuals in this contract, follow-up actions are taken as appropriate. [ 14800, Complaints ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/14800-complaints) Revision 22-1; Effective February 4, 2022 The HHSC IDD Ombudsman refers complaints to the RACs when the complaint is related to noncompliance with the HCS or TxHmL certification principles. HHSC departments refer internal complaints or concerns directly to LTCR. Complaints are reviewed by the RACs and appropriate follow-up actions are identified and completed as appropriate. 14810 Complaints Policy and Procedures Revision 22-1; February 4, 2022 If LTCR staff receive a complaint from an external complainant, the person making the complaint should be immediately referred to the IDD Ombudsman at 800-252-8154. The IDD Ombudsman tries to resolve the complaint with the external complainant and the program provider. If the complaint cannot be resolved and it impacts the HCS certification principles, the IDD Ombudsman will refer it to LTCR. The complaint is received by the RACs, who review it to determine what actions are to be taken. The actions are determined by: - severity of the complaint; and - number and severity of other complaints received about that contract or program provider. Actions to be taken include: - Enter the complaint into the LTCR database, for follow up on the next scheduled survey. - Desk Review - A desk review is conducted if there is low risk to the individual(s). The determination of low risk is made if the complaint did not involve issues that relate to the health or safety of the individual(s) served or if initial contact with the program provider indicates the situation has been satisfactorily resolved. - On-site visits are conducted if it is determined that significant risk exists for one or more individuals. RACs review the complaint with the RAC manager or designee prior to scheduling an on-site visit. [ 14900, Four-Person Residence Approvals ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/14900-four-person-residence-approvals) Revision 22-1; Effective February 4, 2022 Home and Community-based Services (HCS) providers must request and obtain approval of all four-person residences from HHSC.

[ 15000, Review of Authority ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/15000-review-authority) [ 15100, Quality Oversight of Home and Community-based Services Program Local Intellectual and Developmental Disability Authority Responsibilities ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/15100-quality-oversight-home-community-based-services-program-local-intellectual-developmental) Revision 22-2; Effective May 1, 2022 Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) ensures contract accountability and oversight of Local Intellectual and Developmental Disability Authorities (LIDDAs) through a variety of methods including, but not limited to, ongoing review and monitoring of the HHSC data system's data, service encounter data, financial data and an annual Home and Community-based Services (HCS) review. Ongoing Monitoring HHSC conducts ongoing monitoring reviews in several areas. These activities are part of HHSC's broad oversight of LIDDA performance and include HCS authority functions. This includes review of enrollment activity, utilization review, verification of service encounter data, integrity review of service encounter data and review of financial data. Detailed information regarding HHSC requirements for LIDDAs can be found in the LIDDA Performance Contract. Review of Requirements for Service Coordination HHSC conducts an annual review of HCS authority functions. This review is announced and includes LIDDA requirements for HCS service coordination. The HCS authority review may result in findings cited in the HHSC LIDDA quality assurance review. This occurs if non-compliance with HHSC rules or LIDDA performance contract requirements is determined to be present, but is beyond the scope of the LIDDA requirements for HCS service coordination. Prior to the Review HHSC assigns a facilitator to coordinate the review activities for a given LIDDA. The facilitator drafts an announcement letter to the LIDDA executive director, which is copied to the LIDDA board chair and the LIDDA's designated contact person for coordinating the review. This letter is followed by direct communications between the facilitator and the LIDDA contact person. The facilitator sends the LIDDA contact person an authority review information and instructions packet that includes the sample of participants and forms to be completed and returned to the facilitator prior to the review. Entrance Conference HHSC staff conduct an entrance conference meeting at the beginning of the review. The entrance conference is between available review team members and key LIDDA staff who will be involved in the review. It serves as an opportunity to review the general agenda, provide information about the review and answer any questions. Service Coordinator Qualifications and Training Qualifications and training requirements for new service coordinators assigned to HCS sample participants are checked using the service coordination staff checklist. Home and Community-based Services Participant Review HHSC review team members perform record reviews using the HCS electronic tool. Follow-up meetings with assigned service coordinators occur at the discretion of the review team members. Review team members may also determine whether there is a need to contact participants and their legally authorized representatives (LARs). Formal Debriefing Throughout the review process, the review team members may point out concerns, identify potential findings, ask for additional information or seek clarification on issues. After completion of the review, the HCS Authority Review Report of Findings is drafted. A formal debriefing is held and identified items of non-compliance are shared with the LIDDA. The LIDDA is then given up to one hour following the formal debriefing to provide additional information that may alter or clear findings. Exit Conference After conclusion of the HCS authority review, a final copy of the HCS Authority Review Report of Findings is provided to the LIDDA. Barring a successful request for reconsideration of findings as described below, if any item is cited as \"Not Met,\" a corrective action plan (CAP) is required. Reconsideration of Findings A LIDDA may request reconsideration of finding(s) of the HCS authority review based on the evidence originally submitted at the time of the review. Instructions to the LIDDA for requesting reconsideration are included at the bottom of the HCS Authority Review Report of Findings. This request for reconsideration must be submitted via email to the facilitator within 10 business days of receipt of the HCS Authority Review Report of Findings. Requests for reconsideration received later than 10 business days after the exit conference are not considered. The facilitator emails a written response to the LIDDA staff requesting reconsideration within 15 calendar days after receiving the LIDDA's request. If a revision to the HCS Authority Review Report of Findings is necessary as a result of the reconsideration, the facilitator ensures a written notification and copy of the revised report is emailed to the LIDDA contact person. If changes in the CAP requirements result, the facilitator emails a revised CAP template to the LIDDA contact person. Amended Report of Findings The HCS Authority Review Report of Findings is amended when the team determines that the final report shared at the exit conference contains an error. The correction is made and the corrected report becomes the Amended HSC Authority Review Report of Findings. The facilitator ensures any resulting changes in the CAP requirement are forwarded with the amended report to the LIDDA contact person with an amended CAP due date 30 days from the date of the amendment. Corrective Action Plan Submission of a CAP is required for any remaining items of non-compliance. The facilitator provides the LIDDA contact person with a CAP template and instructions and guidelines for completing the CAP. The CAP is due to Performance Contracts Management within 30 days after receipt of the HCS Authority Review Report of Findings. The due date for the CAP is identified on the bottom of the final draft of the HCS Authority Review Report of Findings. The facilitator coordinates HHSC review of the CAP. If a need for revision to the CAP is identified, the facilitator communicates that need to the LIDDA contact person. Any revisions to the CAP are submitted by the LIDDA to the facilitator until the review team recommends approval of the CAP by the contract manager. Once the CAP is approved, the CAP acceptance letter is sent out.

This must be an easily understood process for persons and LARs to request a review of their concerns or dissatisfaction. The policy must explain how the person may receive assistance to request the review, the time frames for the review and the method by which the person is informed of the outcome of that review. The LIDDA must present this policy in the language with which the individual and LAR are most comfortable. Each LIDDA must develop a process for receiving and resolving complaints from a program provider related to the LIDDA's provision of service coordination or the LIDDA's process to enroll an applicant in the Home and Community-based Services (HCS) Program. This process must include the LIDDA's telephone number and the toll-free number to the Intellectual and Development Disabilities (IDD) Ombudsman. HCS Program Provider The HCS provider must publicize and make available a process for eliciting complaints. The HCS provider must maintain a record of all verifiable resolutions of complaints received from individuals, their families and their LARs, as well as staff members, service providers, Consumer Directed Services (CDS) providers, the general public and the LIDDA. The HCS provider must establish a consumer/advocate advisory committee that will solicit, address and review all complaints from individuals and LARs about the program provider's operations. When to Call the IDD Ombudsman The IDD Ombudsman receives complaints from individuals, family members and the general public about the care, treatment or services provided to an individual. Individuals receiving services or family members of the individual may prefer to call the IDD Ombudsman to assist in resolving an issue rather than speaking with their LIDDA service coordinator (SC) or HCS provider. A complaint may be reported to the IDD Ombudsman by anyone by calling 800-252-8154 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. A complaint may also be emailed to [OmbudsmanIDD@hhs.texas.gov](mailto:OmbudsmanIDD@hhs.texas.gov). Written complaints may be mailed to: Texas Health and Human Services Commission IDD Ombudsman P.O. Box 13247 Austin, TX 78711-3247 Resolution of Issues Between LIDDAs and Program Providers LIDDAs and HCS providers are encouraged to work together to resolve any issues regarding service provision. If a LIDDA SC identifies an issue of concern regarding an HCS provider, the SC should: - discuss the issue with the HCS provider to attempt to come to a resolution; - if the issue is resolved, document the resolution; - if the issue is not resolved, file a formal complaint with the HCS provider; - if the formal complaint process with the provider resolves the issue, document the resolution; and - if the formal complaint process does not resolve the issue, file a complaint with the IDD Ombudsman. If an HCS provider identifies an issue of concern regarding a LIDDA SC, the program provider should: - discuss the issue with the SC to attempt to come to a resolution; - if the issue is resolved, document the resolution; - if the issue is not resolved, file a formal complaint with the LIDDA; - if the formal complaint process with the LIDDA resolves the issue, document the resolution; and - if the formal complaint process does not resolve the issue, file a complaint with the IDD Ombudsman.

Building relationships and maintaining effective communication with each entity is necessary to accomplish HCS program objectives. 19210 Management Considerations for LIDDAs Revision 21-1; Effective September 21, 2021 Provide a forum for program providers and LIDDA staff to bring forward issues and concerns. When LIDDAs and program providers are able to solve problems together, the partnership is strengthened. Relevant input can be solicited in a number of ways, including the following: - Appoint a program provider advisory group with responsibilities for problem solving. - Ensure program provider advisory group membership represent a variety of providers. - Open program provider advisory group membership to all HCS providers in the LIDDA waiver contract area, or ask for volunteers. - Select a communication forum best suited for the LIDDA (for example, local issues, size of the provider base, size of LIDDA service area, etc.). - Promote regular and relevant communication with program providers through websites or by other means. Establish a climate of support. Each LIDDA should clearly state that its goal is to be successful in the partnership. - Avoid misunderstandings by considering program provider and individual input in the development of clear procedures and guidelines. - Identify staff that can communicate concerns and solve problems quickly. - Publish a formal complaint procedure. Additionally, develop and use more informal methods for complaint resolution. - Develop clear procedures for ensuring that problems are communicated to appropriate program provider and LIDDA staff. Provide opportunities for program providers, families, individuals and LIDDA staff to meet and interact. These opportunities should be available not just during the program provider choice process. Following are some ideas: - Sponsor program provider fairs to give families opportunities to meet program providers face to face, and to give providers opportunities to present their unique characteristics to families. - Establish websites that allow program providers to post information about their programs. - Arrange for program provider and LIDDA staff to meet through a variety of venues (for example, open house events, informational meetings, shared training events). - Foster an understanding of program provider choice as a continuous option by inviting individuals who are currently enrolled in the HCS program to program provider fairs, open house events, etc. Ensure a balance between listening to program provider concerns and asserting the needs of the LIDDA and individuals. A well-rounded relationship between program providers, LIDDAs and individuals should be the goal of the LIDDA. - Service coordinators should let program providers know the needs of the LIDDA and the needs of individuals. - Providers should be encouraged to let the LIDDA know their needs and the needs of their individuals. Develop communication skills that foster good relationships between program providers and individuals. Provide basic communication skills training to service coordinators and supervisors with goals to develop: - listening skills; - recognition of barriers to good communication (for example, judging and moralizing); - compliance with simple conflict resolution rules (for example, respecting others, listening and stating others' viewpoints); and - self-evaluation of staff performance during conflict resolution (for example, what worked and didn't work). Implement strategies to assist service coordinators with program provider communication. Service coordinators are responsible for communicating serious concerns, as well as ongoing information. Strategies for success may include developing: - standard procedures regarding communication; and - forms with program provider input to handle categories of communication (for example, standard communication and service concerns). 19220 Helpful Hints for Service Coordinators Revision 21-1; Effective September 21, 2021 Service coordinators must build relationships with individuals enrolled in the HCS program, families and program providers. Developing and maintaining good relationships will assist in understanding the likes and dislikes of the individual, determining needed services and ensuring the development of a mutually satisfying partnership. Relax and be yourself. - It is part of the service coordinator's job to get to know the individual and people who are important to the individual - including the program provider staff. - It takes time to develop relationships. Invest time with individuals and program providers to understand their needs. - Develop your own style. Be genuine and honest in all you say and do. - Build a good reputation. Be honest, be prompt and return phone calls. - Build trust and mutual respect. - Don't be afraid to admit mistakes - it makes you human. Be positive. - People want to be liked for who they are. - Don't always talk about needs - notice the unique characteristics of individuals. - Let your human side show. Understand mistakes. - Recognize what you learn from individuals, family members and program provider staff. - Respect the role of each partner. Improve skills. - Listen more than you talk. - Attend to the person you are trying to understand by maintaining eye contact and open body language. - Reflect what you hear to ensure your understanding. Use respectful language at all times. - Use person-first language. Refer to the individual, not a disability label. Avoid at all costs: - Moralizing; - Criticizing; and - Giving advice. 19230 Recommended Levels of Communication Between LIDDAs and Program Providers Revision 21-1; Effective September 21, 2021 Communication needs between LIDDAs, program providers and individuals/families differ in different areas of the state. However, it is recommended that all LIDDAs and program providers use the standardized [Form 8583](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/node/17714), Contact Information. This form ensures individuals, their families, program providers and service coordinators have accurate and current contact information for each other. The form should be completed at enrollment and updated as needed. Additionally, it is recommended that all LIDDAs have procedures in place to address the following levels of communication: Level I \u2014 Emergency/Crisis Notification. Level I includes communication about incidents that affect an individual's health and safety, as well as events that disrupt normal procedures of an individual's care. This level of communication may need to occur after hours or as soon as possible during business hours, and may address the following: - emergency medical care; - behavioral crisis; - incidents that involve outside intervention (for example, police, fire, Provider Investigations, etc.); and - safety concerns that require immediate resolution. Level II \u2014 Concerns and Changes in Service Needs. Level II includes communication between the service coordinator and program provider about an individual's issues (for example, an individual's service array, the service provider or individual/family concerns). This level of communication will require regular meetings, as needed, and may address: - service outcomes; - adjustment to the individual's service array (Individual Plan of Care, Person-Directed Plan); - level of need/level of care (ID/RC assessment); - individual, LAR or family concerns; - service planning meetings (with individual, LAR and family consent); - meetings between providers, LAs and/or families to resolve issues; - adjustment/change to Implementation Plan; and - staff changes that affect/change an individual's service providers. Level III \u2014 Relationships. Relationship building, courtesy and mutual cooperation should be an ongoing process that starts during transition and continues on a broader scale after program implementation.

Click [here](/sites/default/files/documents/laws-regulations/handbooks/hcs/CMS%2021000.pdf) to see a modified version of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Quality Framework for Home and Community-Based Services (2002). The information is used to outline this shared partnership. This framework provides a schema that focuses on person-directed desired outcomes along six dimensions by individual, provider, local authority and the Department of Aging and Disability Services (DADS). The six focused dimensions are: - Individual Access - Person-Directed Service Planning and Delivery - Provider Capacity and Capabilities - Individual Safeguards - Individual Outcomes and Satisfaction - System Performance The framework defines quality through the delineation of desired outcomes across the six dimensions. Acquisition of these measures indicates a successful service delivery system. The challenge for the partners is to identify areas of success and areas that require additional action. Solutions must be carefully crafted to address areas that need improvement. All partners must commit to sustaining a system of service delivery that promotes and supports individuals who receive Home and Community-based Services (HCS).

Overview of Discovery Discovery is the process of listening to people and learning about what they want from their lives. It is getting to know people so that their personal outcomes, preferences, choices and abilities are understood, documented and form the foundation of planning their services and supports. Discovery is the basis for the Person-Directed Plan (PDP) and service delivery. It is an ongoing process that occurs each time the service coordinator talks to the person or those who know the person best. It is necessary to record the information learned so that it can be used when developing or updating the PDP. The service coordinator leads the discovery process, acting on behalf of the person whose services and supports are being planned. The following core values guide the development of community supports and services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. These values form an essential foundation for the discovery process and service selection: - Self Determination. People should make decisions about things that affect their lives. The service coordinator supports the person in making choices. People should have information about directing their own services and supports and opportunities to do so. - Community Inclusion. People receiving services should have opportunities to lead a satisfying life - making friends, participating in preferred activities, and being involved in and valued in their community. The service coordinator recognizes the need for people to belong and examine opportunities for supporting connections. - Meaningful Relationships. People receiving services need opportunities to develop close relationships with others, maintain the relationships they have, and form new associations with persons and groups with similar interests and purposes. The service coordinator explores and advocates for ways the person may develop relationships and associations beyond staff and other existing relationships, based on the person's interests and desires. Barriers to creating bonds with others should be addressed. - Maintaining Non-waiver Supports. Discovery includes identifying existing natural supports, such as supports provided by friends, family or others that are not to be replaced by paid services. The loss of these supports could leave the person without meaningful relationships or community connections. Non-waiver supports also include generic services and resources (e.g., the Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services (DARS), public education, Day Activity and Health Services, the Comprehensive Care Program, state plan Medicaid services, etc.) that must be used prior to accessing waiver services. Building a trusting relationship is the means by which the service coordinator discovers what is important to the person. The following should be demonstrated when building relationships: - A caring attitude, interest in the person and respect for the wishes of the person and family. - Willingness to spend time with the person. When first supporting someone, the service coordinator often sees the person at least once a month to give sufficient time to get to know him/her. - Finding the positive and building on talents. Everyone wants to be liked for who they are. The service coordinator should not always focus on the person's needs, but rather build the person's confidence and self-esteem. - Ability to be trusted. Following through with promises is important to people and their families. Honor the individual's request not to share private information. Trust will help the person to open up and talk about his/her life. - Willingness to admit mistakes. Communication, listening and observation skills are indispensable for a service coordinator. These skills are needed when conducting discovery, facilitating meetings and when interacting with people receiving services, their families, providers and other community organizations (including the service coordinator's own agency). The best environment for a conversation about a person is a comfortable place without noise and distractions. Privacy must be maintained when discussing personal information. When the person is present, speak directly to the person. When other people are engaged in the conversation (including interpreters), be sure to look at the person who receives services so that you can see his/her reaction to the discussion through his/her facial expressions and body language. It is important to engage different people in different ways to accommodate individual ways of communicating. Learning about a person's communication abilities, including whether a person uses a communication device, is important when arranging a time to talk. It is also important to allow enough time to accommodate a person who communicates slowly or may require frequent breaks to remain engaged. Identifying preferences ahead of time, such as convenient times or days, may help guide successful questions and conversation. - Starting Conversations. Introduce yourself and explain the purpose of the visit (as obvious as this seems, it is often overlooked). Conversations with people receiving services can be started in many ways, depending on the interests and preferences of the person. Sometimes it may be necessary to start a conversation about an activity the person is interested in or participated in recently. A conversation may be started by asking about an item that belongs to the person or is present in his/her environment. Avoid immediately diving into questions that could seem too abrupt or too personal. Possible ways to start a conversation: - Tell me about yourself. - Tell me about your day. - What would you like me to know today? - You look so happy today. What put that smile on your face? - You look upset. Do you want to talk? - I see a lot of pictures in your room. Can you tell me about them? - What do you like to do? If a person does not want to communicate, loses interest or does not have the tools necessary to communicate, ask if it would be better to come back later. - Gathering Information. Ask permission before asking personal questions. Questions should be centered on the concerns or interests of the person. You will not be able to get all important information immediately. Many people respond to opening requests, such as: - Tell me about your family. - Tell me about your friends. - I'm interested in knowing more about you. - Tell me about your favorite things. - Tell me about things you don't like. The person may have a specific issue that is dominating the conversation. Go with it and let the person feel and express himself. It helps the person to speak at his own pace. Learn to be silent, as this can also be a way to connect. If the conversation shifts away from the person, redirect the focus back to the person. If necessary, be persistent in keeping the person the center of conversation. Be careful not to ask too many questions and observe nonverbal communication to determine when the conversation needs to take a new direction. - Listening. Listening well can sometimes be challenging, but it is a critical skill in discovery. It is how we learn about people. Let people know you are listening. - Talk to the person, not around the person, if the person is not alone. - Ask the right questions. Avoid questions with yes or no answers that are not exploratory and do not provide opportunities for people to express themselves. - Allow adequate time for the person to respond. - Reflect back the last statement you heard. - Paraphrase and sum up what you have heard during the conversation - Observing and Nonverbal Communication. If a person is able to effectively communicate through conversation, discovery is often easier. However, a great deal can also be learned through nonverbal communication. - Body language often provides information about what a person is thinking or feeling. - Some people may use gestures, behavior or other means of getting their point across. Help may be needed from family or others who know and care about the person to interpret and learn from what he/she is saying. - Conversation can distract from nonverbal communication of feelings and emotions. - Some behavior may be a request for help or attention. - Facial and eye expressions provide much information - trust, affection, disapproval, sadness, pain, discomfort, fear, awareness, interest, joy, concern. - Eye contact is important communication and shows respect. - Clothing, grooming, and environment may tell a lot about the person's life. It is especially important to visit people at their home and in other environments. Identifying personal outcomes is the focus of service planning and must be informed by meaningful discovery. It is important for everyone to make plans in order to achieve the outcomes they desire. People need to dream about their future and how they can achieve what is important to them. When talking with a person or gathering information: - Allow the person to dream big. Don't discourage the person from dreaming about his/her future, but explain how to break dreams into attainable short-term outcomes. - The person's outcomes must be clearly identified so that service providers and natural supports can assist the person to achieve them. - Barriers should be recognized and the service coordinator should help the person identify ways to resolve or work around the barriers. - When a service coordinator learns about outcomes, he/she should think about possible methods of achieving these outcomes. Outcomes may be met with assistance from family members, friends, community resources, generic service agencies or waiver services. The service coordinator is responsible for looking for alternative solutions, in addition to considering waiver services. - Be positive. Reflect the outcomes in positive ways. Represent the person. - Ensure health and safety. The service coordinator should gather existing information necessary to identify safety or health issues. The service provider should assist the person with addressing those needs. Health and safety outcomes must not be ignored and the person should be assisted in understanding the importance. - The service coordinator asks permission from the person or legally authorized representative to include service providers in the discovery process. The provider may have day-to-day experience with the person and should be considered a significant source of discovery information to identify outcomes. - Involve other allies identified by the person. - Recognize that the outcomes may change as the service coordinator learns more about the person. II. Using the Discovery Guide This Discovery Guide is intended to support learning about what is important to the person and what others need to know to support the person for each person who receives services and supports. It is designed as a guide for exploration. The service coordinator supports a meaningful discovery process by helping people to speak for themselves, each in his or her own way about his or her own dreams and outcomes. The service coordinator encourages those present to listen and learn about what people want. Examples offered in the Discovery Guide are intended to inspire thinking about the types of information that are important in creating true PDPs. They are only examples and while some may be relevant to a particular individual, information gained from the person and those close to the person will yield individualized results. Gathering important information for those who support and assist the person. The service coordinator documents information that will be helpful for the service provider to know when providing services and supports to the person. This includes a broad profile of the person and important matters in his/her life based on observations, discussions and other relevant information. This information includes: - The people, places and things that give the person happiness, contentment and satisfaction, in the present and in outcomes and dreams for the future. - What people like and admire about the person. Sometimes this may take effort to learn because people are not always accustomed to talking about attributes. Notice the good things about the person and encourage him or her to recognize his or her own strengths and positive attributes. - Background experiences that affect the present. Record events such as milestones, celebrations, institutionalization, losses, trauma, etc. that affect the person today. - Who helps the person make important decisions? Who is a reliable source of information? Who does the person feel closest to? Who else does the person want to have involved in discussions and decisions? If the person is isolated or only talks about staff, it may be a sign that the person needs other relationships and connections. If the person has a guardian, ask if he or she is included in decision making and how. - Preferences for social inclusion and alone time. Don't assume that every person wants to be social all the time. Some people like having many friends; others prefer only a few close relationships. Personal relationships are very important to most people. - Safety issues. Think beyond just supervision, even though that is important. Evaluate whether the environments where a person spends his/her time are healthy and safe. Observation is as important as asking questions. Consider what supports the person needs to be safe, e.g., adaptive aids, caregiver capacity, preparation for emergencies, etc. - Health issues. Document health issues that concern the person. Detailed health information will be reflected in the health assessments completed by the provider. Identifying services to support outcomes. The service coordinator identifies services that support the person's outcomes. Based on the information gathered during discovery, the service coordinator: - Identifies the services that will support the outcomes. - Explains the purpose and outcome of the service (what will the person gain from the service?). - Identifies what is important to the person and what others need to know and do to support the person so the program provider can use this information to design the implementation plan. The examples below are meant to give service coordinators a general idea of how to use information gathered through the discovery process to identify services to support personal outcomes. Example 1: Purpose/Outcome.

While the prompts in this tool may be useful to the Person Directed Plan (PDP) Discovery process, it should not be considered all-inclusive, exhaustive or as a substitute meaningful discovery. While service coordinators generally use ongoing face-to-face discussions, record reviews and communications with family members and staff (who know the person best) to gather discovery information.

[ Appendix XI, Solicitation Prohibition ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/appendix-xi-solicitation-prohibition) [ Appendix XII, Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation Training and Competency Test ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/appendix-xii-abuse-neglect-exploitation-training-competency-test) Revision 19-2; Effective June 5, 2019 1. Requirement to Train Staff Members, Service Providers, and Volunteers As required by program rule, a Home and Community-based Services (HCS) Program provider must ensure their staff members, service providers and volunteers are: - trained on: - acts that constitute abuse, neglect and exploitation; - signs and symptoms of abuse, neglect and exploitation; and - methods to prevent abuse, neglect and exploitation; and - knowledgeable of: - acts that constitute abuse, neglect and exploitation; - signs and symptoms of abuse, neglect and exploitation; and - methods to prevent abuse, neglect and exploitation; and - instructed to report to Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) immediately, but not later than one hour, after having knowledge or suspicion that an individual has been, or is being, abused, neglected or exploited by: - calling the DFPS Abuse Hotline toll-free telephone number, 1-800-647-7418; or - using the [DFPS Abuse Hotline website](https://www.txabusehotline.org/Login/Default.aspx); and - provided with these instructions described in paragraph c of this section, in writing. 2. Optional Computer-Based Training and Competency Test An HCS Program provider has the option of having their staff members, service providers and volunteers complete the Health and Human Services Commission's (HHSC's) [ANE Competency Training](https://learningportal.hhs.texas.gov/). The completion of the computer-based training by employees, agents, and subcontractors meets the requirement in Section 1a of this appendix. If staff members, service providers and volunteers complete HHSC's [ANE Competency Final Test](https://learningportal.hhs.texas.gov/), they must receive a score of at least 80 percent. The completion of the competency test by staff members, service providers and volunteers meets the requirement in Section 1b of this appendix. Staff members, service providers and volunteers must first sign up on the Learning Portal to have access to HHSC approved trainings, including this ANE training, entitled [ANE Competency Training and Exam (online)](https://learningportal.hhs.texas.gov/). The ANE training is found in [Medicaid Long Term Services and Supports Training](https://learningportal.hhs.texas.gov/) under the [Health and Human Services Commission Courses](https://learningportal.hhs.texas.gov/) tab. Link to the Learning Portal homepage: [https://learningportal.hhs.texas.gov/](https://learningportal.hhs.texas.gov/) 3. Documentation Requirements Program providers must maintain records documenting staff members, service providers and volunteers have received training on ANE. If using HHSC's ANE Competency Training as evidence of ANE training, the HCS program provider must maintain a copy of the certificate generated from the HHSC's [ANE Competency Final Test](https://learningportal.hhs.texas.gov/) for each staff member, service provider and volunteer. The program provider must maintain training records in accordance with 40 TAC [\u00a749.307](https://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&app=9&p_dir=&p_rloc=&p_tloc=&p_ploc=&pg=1&p_tac=&ti=40&pt=1&ch=49&rl=307) Record Retention and Disposition. [ Appendix XIII, Value-added Services ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/appendix-xiii-value-added-services) Revision 19-3; Effective November 25, 2019 Value-added services (VAS) are extra benefits offered by managed care organizations (MCOs) beyond Medicaid-covered services. VAS may include routine dental, vision, podiatry, health and wellness services. VAS may be actual health care services, benefits or positive incentives Texas Health and Human Services Commission determines to promote healthy lifestyles, improving health outcomes among its members. Each MCO offers a different set of VAS and the MCO can change the VAS it offers every six months. MCOs must cover all benefits in Medicaid managed care programs, such as STAR+PLUS, STAR Kids and STAR Health. The MCO utilizes VAS to distinguish itself from another MCO. In addition, members may use VAS to help choose which MCO has the added benefits best suited for their needs. VAS are not considered non-waiver resources and therefore, waiver program providers do not consider VAS offered by the MCO when considering third-party resources. VAS is an added benefit available to individuals from the MCO providing their acute care services. [ Forms ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/forms) ES = Spanish Changes ](/handbooks/home-community-based-services-handbook/22-3-section-7000-changes) Revision 22-3; Effective Oct. 19, The Revision May 4, The following change(s) were made: |Section||Title||Change| |14000||Long-Term Care Regulatory||Changes section title and throughout the section, changes \"Waiver Survey and Certification (WSC)\" with \"Long-Term Care and TxHmL Overview||Clarifies the functions of LTCR, which includes completing initial certification and annual recertification surveys for contracts operated by program providers to ensure compliance with the certification principles located in the Texas Administrative Code (TAC), completing residential visits for Host Home/Companion Care and three- and four-person homes residences, and reviewing complaints and deaths in the program.| |14200||Home and Community-based Services Surveys||Changes section title and corrects TAC references to certification principles. Replaces \"announced or unannounced reviews\" with \"intermittent survey.\"| |14210||Types of Surveys||Changes section title and deletes provisional certification information. Adds that for recertification surveys, a program provider must demonstrate compliance with all certification principles to be certified for another 365-day period. Clarifies that if the program provider is out of compliance with any certification principles, LTCR sends a final report with a list of violations to the program provider within 14 calendar days after the day of exit and the program provider must submit a Plan of Correction (PoC ) within 14 calendar days of receipt of the report. Makes other minor wording changes and delineates the time frames needed for a critical and noncritical violation. For a critical violation, the PoC must include that corrective action will be completed within 30 calendar days after the date of the survey exit conference and an on-site follow-up survey will be conducted after the 30-day period to determine if the program provider completed the corrective action in accordance with their PoC. For a violation that is not critical, the PoC must include that corrective action will be completed within 45 calendar days after the date of the survey exit conference and an on-site follow-up survey is conducted after the 45-day period to determine if the program provider completed the corrective action in accordance with their PoC. If LTCR determines that the program provider has not completed the corrective action or they have failed to submit an acceptable PoC, HHSC imposes a vendor hold against the program provider or denies or terminates the certification. Adds that LTCR will conduct a follow-up survey at least 31 calendar days after the effective date of the vendor hold, and if the program provider has not completed the corrective action, HHSC will deny or terminate the certification. Adds that intermittent surveys are always unannounced and also based on internal HHSC referrals.| |14220||Overview of the Home and Community-based Services Certification Survey Process||Changes section title and makes minor wording changes. Removes that HCS program providers will generally be contacted before a certification review by the review facilitator, unless there is cause to conduct an unannounced review of the program. Removes \"over 90 days\" in certification review activities and removes \"as a part of WSC reviews, reviewers note any issues related to service coordination and forward any concerns to HHSC Contract Accountability and Oversight (CAO) for follow up. HCS program providers may view notations related to their programs in the C-97 screen of the CARE system.\" Removes \"a citation can only be cleared if the original instance of noncompliance has been remediated, a new sample of individuals or records are in compliance for that principle, and the provider can show a change in process or policy that ensures no future occurrences of noncompliance.\" Clarifies that if the survey team identifies an immediate threat, the program provider must immediately provide the survey team with a plan of removal. Replaces \"informal review process\" with \"informal dispute resolution (IDR)\" and explains if a program provider disagrees with the survey results, they may request an IDR. The IDR is an informal process by which a program provider can dispute, before an independent third party, the findings on which a violation is based. The outcome of the IDR serves as the independent third party's recommendation to HHSC regarding the program provider's compliance or noncompliance with program rules. The program provider must still submit an acceptable PoC no later than 14 calendar days after receiving Form 3724 from HHSC even if it chooses to use the IDR process.| |14230||Plan of Correction (PoC)||Changes section title from \"Corrective Action Plan\" to \"Plan of Correction (PoC).\" Clarifies within 14 calendar days after receiving the final survey report, the program provider must submit a PoC to address each violation that was identified during the survey. This applies even if the provider disagrees with the findings of violations or requests IDR. For violations that are critical, the PoC must include the corrective action(s) the program provider will take for each violation with a completion date within 30 calendar days from the survey exit conference. For violations that are noncritical, the PoC must include the corrective action(s) the program provider will take for each violation with a completion date within 45 calendar days from the survey exit conference. HHSC will review the PoC and the program provider will be notified in writing whether the plan has been approved or denied. If the plan is denied, the program provider must submit a revised plan within five business days. Once the plan is approved, HHSC will request that the program provider submit evidence of the correction to HHSC and HHSC can conduct a follow-up survey to verify the corrections.| |14240||Home and Community-based Services Review Checklists||Deletes section.| | | Deletes information related to the complaint process and deletes RACs review the allegation with the WSC risk assessment manager, assistant director, and director or designee prior to scheduling an on-site visit.
