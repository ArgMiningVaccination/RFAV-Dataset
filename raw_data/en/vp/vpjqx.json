Get the kashaya ingredients - Make Kashaya Get the kalka herb - make paste. Start cooking the oil Till when to heat the oil: The oil is heated till the total moisture quantity evaporates from the mix. The final product should be devoid of any moisture content. How to know that oil is finally made? First take the oil in the vessel. Add Kalka (herbal paste) to it. Mark the level of the oil in the vessel. Approximately the final liquid level should be the marked level. It may be slightly higher as herb paste swells while making the oil. Signs of proper preparation Signs to watch at the end: Fragrance of the herbs become apparent The herb paste can be rolled into the form of wick The herb paste when put on fire does not make sound. Oil starts yielding froth. In the mid, the total paste + liquid becomes one dirty looking mix. Nearing to the end, oil gets clearly separated from the paste. Precautions Do not start heating oil first and then add kashaya. If oil starts boiling and then you add Kashaya, it may explode. Use moderate heat. Constant stirring - both while making kashaya and the oil Use wide mouthed vessel for quicker evaporation Be alert at the end stage After oil is ready, filter the oil soon after it is made. Days for oil preparation Number of days for oil preparation: Making Kashaya and then making oil may not get completed in one day time. Ayurveda also recommends making the oil in 2 or more days.
