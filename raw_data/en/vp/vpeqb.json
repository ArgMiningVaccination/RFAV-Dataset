Medicare may cover these services to help a patient transition back to a community setting after a stay at certain facility types. This booklet focuses on covered services, location, who may provide services, supervision, billing services, documenting services, and service benefits. TCM Services Requirements Required patient TCM services include: Supporting the patient's transition to the community setting Health care professionals who accept patient care at post-facility discharge without a service gap Health care professionals taking responsibility for patient's care Moderate or high complexity medical decision making for patients who have medical or psychosocial problems The 30-day TCM period begins on a patient's inpatient discharge date and continues for the next 29 days. TCM services begin the day of discharge from 1 of these inpatient or partial hospitalization settings: Inpatient Acute Care Hospital Inpatient Psychiatric Hospital Long-Term Care Hospital Skilled Nursing Facility Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Hospital outpatient observation or partial hospitalization Partial hospitalization at a Community Mental Health Center After inpatient discharge, the patient must return to their community setting.

Supervision The TCM codes are care management codes. As care management codes, auxiliary personnel may provide the non-face-to-face services of TCM under the general supervision of the physician or NPP subject to applicable state law, scope of practice, and the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) \"incident to\" rules and regulations. CNMs, CNSs, NPs, and PAs may also provide the non-face-to-face services of TCM incident to the services of a physician. TCM Components When a patient is discharged from an approved inpatient setting, you must provide at least these TCM components over the course of the 30-day service period: An Interactive Contact Within 2 business days following the patient's discharge, you must contact the patient or their caregiver via phone, email, or face-to-face. You or your \"clinical staff\" (A person who works under the supervision of a physician or other qualified health care professional and is allowed by law , regulation, and facility policy to perform or assist in the performance of a specialized professional service, but who doesn't individually report that professional service) can address patient status and needs beyond scheduling follow-up care. Get more information about interactive contacts in the CPT Codebook at the American Medical Association Store . Report the service if you make 2 or more unsuccessful separate attempts in a timely manner. Document your attempts in the medical record if you meet all other TCM criteria.

Medication Reconciliation & Management You must provide medication reconciliation and management on or before the face-to-face visit date. Billing TCM Services This list offers TCM services billing tips: Only 1 physician or NPP may report TCM services. Report services once per patient during the TCM period. The same health care professional may discharge the patient from the hospital, report hospital or observation discharge services, and bill TCM services. The required face-to-face visit can't take place on the same day you report discharge day management services. Report reasonable and necessary Evaluation and Management (E/M) services (except required face-to-face visit) to manage the patient's clinical issues separately. You can't bill TCM services and services within a post-operative global surgery period (Medicare doesn't pay TCM services if any of the 30-day TCM period falls within a global surgery period for a procedure code billed by the same practitioner). At a minimum, document this information in the patient's medical record: Patient discharge date Patient or caregiver first interactive contact date Face-to-face visit date Medical complexity decision making (moderate or high) CPT only copyright 2020 American Medical Association.
