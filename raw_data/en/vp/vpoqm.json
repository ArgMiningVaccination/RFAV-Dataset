Even in today's world, discussions around sex and sexual health is uncommon and seen as inappropriate. But for eons, sex has played a significant role in maintaining one's overall health. According to Ayurveda, sex is not just limited to pleasure and reproduction, rather it is said to be one of the three pillars of Ayurveda, that can nourish and nurture our bodies and help balance the doshas.

Others include Rasa (plasma), Rakta (blood), Mamsa (muscle tissues), Medas (fat tissues), Asthi (bone tissues), Majja (bone marrow). Shukra Dhatu is related to the reproductive tissues like sperm and semen in the male body and the egg in the female body. That said, a healthy and balanced Shukra dhatu is said to maintain and regulate overall wellness. Excess libido can therefore result in an unbalanced and increased Shukra dhatu, while lack of the same can lead to weakness, impotency, and problems related to infertility, as per Ayurveda.

Its primary function is vyadhikshamatva, which is the body's capacity to fight against disease and strengthen immunity. That said, according to Ayurveda, sex and our sexual behaviour deeply influences our immune system and the flow of vital energy.

This is also the time when nature is enhancing shukra within our vessels, therefore also being the best time to conceive. Similarly, sexual activity is said to deplete during the Summer and Rainy seasons, as Pitta & Vata energy are more dominant. Reproductive vitality is believed to be at its lowest during this time. As per Ayurvedic principles, one must take some tonic, rasayana herbal formulations if they're indulging in sexual activities at an inappropriate time, according to Ayurveda.

According to the greatest classical Ayurvedic text 'Ashtanga Hridayam' written by Vagbhata, \"During the winter season, the person can indulge in sex daily as much as they like after making use of aphrodisiacs and obtaining strength; once in three days in spring and fall; and once every two weeks in the rainy season and summer.\" It is based on the principle \"like increases like\" and \"opposites decrease,\" which means balancing out the qualities of the season, with an appropriate sexual routine. As per the Ayurvedic text, we can have sex every day in the winter\u2014but only after \"making use of aphrodisiacs and obtaining strength.\" In addition, Vagbhata recommends having sex only every two weeks in the summer. This is said to be the time of the year when the body is the least strong because of all the output of energy and activity. One is advised to indulge in cooling practices and sex is not one of them. Vaghbata says that the body is medium in strength in the spring and the fall, strongest in the winter, and weakest in the summer, hence accordingly one should indulge or overindulge in sex.
