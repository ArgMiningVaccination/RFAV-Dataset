Description of c onceptual framework Implementation science is \"the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic up take of research findings and other evidence-based practices into routine practice, and h ence, to improve quality and effectiveness of health services\" .1 The Proctor Conceptual Model guides the process of evaluating both implementation and clin ical outcomes of a specific clinical intervention. The Proctor Conceptual Model for the study of Implementat ion Research comprises three domains: clinical intervention, implementation strategie s and outcome measurement.2 Clinical Interventions are evidence-based practices. The clinical intervention of interest in this scoping review i s chiropractic care, which includes evaluation and treatment . Common treatments provided by DCs for back and neck pain include joint manipulation, soft tissue therapy, patien t education, and exercise instruction.3, 4 These approach es align with clinical practice guidelines for back pain, neck pain, and headache.5-12 Implementation strategies are defined as methods to enhance the adoption, impl ementation, sustainment, and scale-up of an innovation.13 Implementation strategies address facilitators and/or barriers to successful implementation at one or more socioecological levels, such as policy, systems environ ment, organizational structure, individual providers, and consumers. Furthermore, implementation strategies in fluence the uptake of the 'clinical intervention' throug h addressing barriers at one or more levels of influence (e.g. patient -, provider-, clinic- , and health -system factors) to facilitate implementation The Expert Recommendations fo r implementing Change (ERIC) Project taxonomy is a comprehensive organized list of implementation strategies.14-16 The ERIC Project encompasses a set of 73 implementation strategies across 9 domains. Outcome measurement , in the Proctor Conceptual Model, differentiates imp lementation and clinical outcomes. Successful implementation is thought to be necessary for clin ically efficacious interventions to be effective in real w orld settings.2 The Proctor Conceptual Model identifies and defines ei ght core implementation outcomes.17 Three of these implementation outcomes (acceptability, appropriateness, f easibility) are strong predictors of implementation su ccess, BMJ Publishing Group Limited (BMJ) disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any relianceSupplemental material placed on this supplemental material which has been supplied by the author(s) BMJ Open doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043754:e043754. 11 2021;BMJ Open, et al.

Extraction guide Clinical intervention: Chiropractic care Clinical Intervention Treatment Description Components of chiropractic care3, 9, 10 Spinal manipulation Manual therapy applied to the spine that in volves a high velocity, low amplitude impulse or thrust applied at or near the en d of a joint's passive range of motion. Soft-tissue therapy Refers to active or passive m anual therapies in which soft tissues (muscles, tendons, or ligaments ) are actively engaged, e.g., myofascial release, muscle energy technique, or are passively pressed and kneaded by hand or with mechanical devices, e.g., massage. Patient education A process to enable individuals to make informed decisions about their personal health-related behavior, e.g., Pamphlets, boo ks, videos, neck schools, discussion with healthcare providers. Content may in clude general back pain information, neuroscience of pain, instruction in ergonomics, principles of self-relaxation/CBT, etc. Nutritional supplements A product intended to supplement the diet, taken by mo uth, containing one or more dietary ingredients, e.g., vitamins, minerals, h erbs or other botanicals, amino acids, enzymes, tissues from organs or gland s, or extracts of these. Exercise instruction and prescription Exercise refers to any series of movements with the aim of training or developing the body by routine practice or as physical trai ning to promote good physical health. Exercise therapy includes a wide variet y of techniques common for the treatment and rehabilitatio n of neck pain, e .g., Strengthening, flexibility, stretching/range of motion Cold/Ice Physico-chemical modalities use d to create a thermal effect, such as cold at the skin level, affecting structures beneath the skin.

Mobilization/ Manual traction Manual treatment applied to the spine or joints of th e upper or lower extremity that incorporates a low velocity and small or la rge amplitude oscillatory movement, within a joint's passive range of mo tion. Orthopedic supports Functional assistive devices intend ed to align, support or otherwise indirectly facilitate function in the affected region, e .g., shoe orthotics, taping, braces. Electrical simulation Electrical muscle stimulation transmits electrical impulses to muscles via electrodes placed superficially on the skin. Ultrasound Ultrasound is an oscillating sound pressure wave affecting structures beneath the skin surface. Acupuncture A therapeutic technique that utilizes a thin metal need le to puncture the skin and stimulate specific points. Various acupuncture techniqu es exist, as well as the use of other types of stimulation in combination with or instead of a needle. Acupuncture interventions include body needling, moxibustion, electroacupuncture, laser acupuncture, microsystem acupuncture and acupressure.

Develop a formal implementation blueprint Develop a formal implementation blueprint that includ es all goals and strategies. The blueprint should include the following: 1) aim/purpose of the implementation; 2) scope of the change ( e.g., what organizational units are affected); 3) timeframe and milestones; and 4) appropr iate performance/progress measures. Use and update this plan to guide the implementation effort over time.
