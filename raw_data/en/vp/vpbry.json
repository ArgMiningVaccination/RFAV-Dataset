Nitesh Chawla, PhD, associate professor of computer science and engineering at Notre Dame, and doctoral student Darcy Davis developed what they are calling the Collaborative Assessment and Recommendation Engine. The system applies big data analytics, based on information from other patients with similar health risks and lifestyles, to a patient's medical record to create personalized disease risk profiles and care plans. The system was awarded a U.S. patent and will be piloted this year.
