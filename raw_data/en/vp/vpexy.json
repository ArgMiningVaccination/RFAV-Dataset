Decentralized generation could save $5 trillion in capital investment, reduce power costs by 40 percent, reduce vulnerabilities, and cut greenhouse gas emissions in half. THOMAS R. CASTEN and BRENNAN DOWNES 34 Exploring Controversies in the Art and Science of Polygraph Testing Polygraph testing has always been controversial, with a wide gulf separating practitioners from scientists with relevant expertise. Myths about its alleged objectivity and infallibility stem from a failure to recognize that the polygraph simply records physiological responses and that the validity with which deception can be diagnosed depends on the nature of the examination and its social context.

HINES 52 EDITOR'S NOTE Critical Inquiry, and Thinking About Galileo In an editorial in our January/February 2004 issue, I spoke of our intention in the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER \"to examine more issues of broad social import that involve science and technology, not duplicating the efforts of other publications but wher\u00ad ever we see an opportunity for science, reason, and critical inquiry to play a useful role.\" The first two articles in this issue are in that vein. The first, on the merits of decentralized vs. centralized generation of electrical energy, is indeed a totally new topic for us. The second, a balanced and informed look at polygraph testing, is one we have dealt with regularly, with at least five earlier articles and news pieces from 1990-2003. And that fact makes another point: We have never limited ourselves to investi\u00ad gations of paranormal or pseudoscientific claims. In the early 1990s I made a list of past SI articles that fell into neither of these categories. It covered an entire page. A similar list today would be much longer. But what all have in common is apply\u00ad ing critical inquiry to science-related claims and issues of popular appeal or public importance. Tom Casten, lead author of our cover article, is an energy entrepreneur who brings a background in economics and deep interests in science, technology, and critical thinking (he has long been associated with CSICOP) to his examination of the relative efficiencies of centralized vs. decentralized generation of power. I think you will find the revelations by him and colleague Brennan Downes surprising. Many first-rate scientists are often by necessity so narrowly focused on their work that they have little time or inclination to get involved in wider issues. Others somehow manage to commit themselves to science education, writing for the pub\u00ad lic, bringing scientific insights to public policy debates, and defending science against promulgators of pseudoscience. Physicist and 2003 Nobel Prize recipient Vitaly L. Ginzburg is clearly one of the latter. We present two articles by him in this issue, both confronting specifics of pseudoscience and showing how it differs from real science. The evening-long tribute to Galileo at the Fifth World Skeptics Congress near Padua, Italy (see the ensuing pages), was a moving experience. Knowledgeably hosted by television journalist and science author Piero Angelo, pan of it featured actors playing Galileo and the three figures in his two key \"Dialogues.\" Padua and Florence were the cradle of the Italian renaissance, widi creative new thinking and discoveries in an, architecture, medicine, and science. It was equally moving later (in Venice), to see wooden models of Leonardos inventions, climb up to Brunelleschi s dome in Florence, and visit the science history museum in Florence where many of Galileo's scientific instruments are displayed. Returning home, I reread J. Bronowski's memorable chapter in The Ascent of Man on Galileo's trial. A concluding passage notes one effect of this tenible wielding of ideology and power against science and open inquiry: \"The effect of die trial and of the imprisonment was to put a total stop to die scientific tradition in the Mediterranean. From now on the Scientific Revolution moved to Northern Europe.\" Can such a shift still happen today, when many powerful ideological interests are so distrustful of at least certain aspects of science? It's a sobering thought. Skeptical Inquirer THI MAGAZINE f0 SCIENCE AND IIASOH EDITOR Kendrick Frazier EDITORIAL BOARD James E.

Other revolutionary figures in the history of science likewise had Padua connections. Among them were Nico- laus Copernicus, who studied there, and Andreas Vesalius, who took his medical degree there before publishing his revela\u00ad tions about human anatomy in 1543. That was the same year that Copernicus published, on his deathbed, On the Revolution of the Heavenly Spheres, the book that cast aside the notion of an Earth-centered universe. Thus began the conflict between religious belief and sci\u00ad entific discovery diat led to Galileo's epic tribulations with the Catholic church and that echoes down through the ages to this day. The conference theme was \"Solving Mysteries.\" Throughout, speakers touted the unique abilities of the meth\u00ad ods of scientific and skeptical inquiry in finding solutions to mysteries that oth\u00ad erwise remain the domain of opinion and speculation. The three-day conference, which had a sold-out attendance of nearly 500 (the capacity of the comfortable modern con\u00ad ference center's theater, surrounded by hotels and restaurants), was cosponsored by the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) and its Italian counterpart group, CICAP (pronounced \"chee-cap\"). CICAP numbers among its members some of Italy's leading scientists, scholars, and investigators, many of whom were in evidence as conference participants. Galileo himself was the subject of an entire evening of special events the first night of the conference, while a slightly more recent hero of skepticism, the con\u00ad juror and investigator James Randi, was feted the second night (see side stories). Randi also gave a talk earlier that day on \"difficult, innocent, and impossible applicants\" for his $1 million challenge to psychic claimants. CICAP Chairman Steno Ferluga, professor of astrophysics at the Uni\u00ad versity of Trieste, opened the conference with a basic statement of the meeting. CICAP, CSICOP, and the skeptical movement represent a \"new thing,\" he said. \"Finally there exists a network of people to find answers, offer corrections, and provide accurate information on popular mysteries.\" This \"light of reason\" can help con\u00ad fine paranormal beliefs to those who want to believe, instead of to all those previously innocently confused by mis\u00ad information about claims once ignored by scientists. \"We skeptics don't deny mysterious events,\" he said. \"We come here to solve them.\" In his opening remarks, CSICOP Chairman Paul Kurtz, professor emeritus of philosophy at SUNY-Buffalo, noted that he had come to Italy three times beginning twenty years ago to encourage Italian scientists and skeptics to organize a group. He said he was pleased with the subsequent work of that group, which has high visibility in Italy, and the grand conference it had organized. The mod\u00ad ern skeptical move\u00ad ment has provided \"a critical scientific examination\" of pop\u00ad ular claims and \"a whole new litera\u00ad ture,\" Kurtz said. But he gave equal emphasis to a \"second principle\" of the movement: \"to explicate and defend scientific out\u00ad look. . . . We are interested in cultivating public appreciation of science.\" \"This is positive,\" he said \"\u2014carrying to the general public our appreciation of this powerful invention, the discovery of CICAP's Massimo Polidoro moderates a World Skeptics Congress session.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 5 NEWS AND COMMENT truth about nature through experimen\u00ad tal science.\" So in this mission, Kurtz said, \"the skeptical movement has moved on . .. to other equally important things.\" Kurtz spoke admiringly of Galileo. \"In one sense,\" he said, \"Galileo is a symbol of skeptical inquiry. He ques\u00ad tioned authority. He rejected author\u00ad ity\u2014Aristotle, the Church. \"Galileo is die great martyr to die skeptical cause,\" Kurtz said. He rejected occult explanations, and he championed a new method involving experimentation, hypotheses, theories, and mathematics. \"Galileo was a heroic figure, a great skeptic,\" said Kurtz. \"He was not a dogmatic skeptic, but thought that there were reliable methods for achiev\u00ad ing knowledge.\" And one more point from Kurtz: \"Science and skepticism go hand in hand. Skepticism is a great tool of science.\" Thus began three sparkling days of presentations, discussions, questions, entertainment (including a lunchtime first-ever performance of \"skeptical\" arias from famous operas), and special events and demonstrations. It was a truly international conference, with attendees from twenty countries. Speakers heralded from Argentina, Belgium, Canada, China, Egypt, Ger\u00ad many, Italy, France, Russia, Spain, die United Kingdom, and the United States. The conference language was English, with simultaneous translation into Italian, although occasionally that was reversed. Formal conference sessions dealt with parapsychology (moderated by Ray Hyman, University of Oregon); hoaxes, fakes, and myths (Lorenzo Montali, University of his\u00ad torical myths (Massimo Polidoro, University of Milan\u2014his column in this issue on fact and fiction about the Kennedy assassination is based on his presentation); magic and the psychology of deception (Sergio Delia Sala, University of Edinburgh); die future of skepticism and a world skeptics update (Barry Karr, CSICOP); and how alter\u00adnative medicine can be hazardous to your health (Silvio Garattini, Mario Negri Institute, Milan). Three or four leading figures in these fields spoke in each session, followed by a lively ques\u00ad tion period. Only a few highlights can be men\u00ad tioned here, some brief examples. CICAP plans to eventually publish a book based on the conference proceedings. The opening session, \"Parapsy\u00ad chology and Skeptics: Is Dialogue Possible?\" had a bittersweet quality because the scheduled leadoff speaker, Robert L. Morris, professor of parapsy\u00ad chology at the University of Edinburgh and highly respected by both skeptics and parapsychologists, had died unex\u00ad pectedly in August. He was only sixty. Carolyn Watt, a senior research fellow at Edinburgh's Koestler Parapsychology Unit, which Morris had established and headed, gave a talk in his stead, dedi\u00ad cated to him. She spoke on \"productive and unproductive interactions\" between parapsychologists and skeptics, urging more of the former and less of the latter. In the productive category are \"direct, personal, involvement and collabora\u00ad tions,\" much like Hyman has done in the past with Charles Honorton or that Richard Wiseman has carried out in the U.K. Unproductive interactions include debates at a distance, which become increasingly polemical, and unsupported and sweeping statements, including unscientific rhetoric and misrepresenting opponents' views. Richard Wiseman (University of Hertfordshire), who has high visibility in the U.K. as a psychologist who involves parapsychologists, the media, and the public in his investigations, spoke of some of his recent experiments, including research with a medium described recently in The Times (U.K.) and his \"Mind Machine,\" a multimedia interactive kiosk that invites the public to participate in an extrasensory percep\u00ad tion experiment. In 139,000 trials with 28,856 people, he said, the hits amounted to 49.90 percent \u2014\"chance,\" he reported. \"No evidence of ESP.\" He said this is an example of how skeptics can do research that involves the public. As for Carolyn Watts's call for more interactions between skeptics and para\u00ad psychologists, Wiseman agreed, to a point. \"Should we collaborate if the research is about genuine open inquiry? Yes,\" he said. Skeptical psychologists can and have helped mightily with a number of parapsychology experiments, he said, tightening up controls and finding small errors, which can easily creep in. But too many parapsychological researchers have another aim altogether, he said. \"There are people who are certain of the answers,\" he said. \"They are engaged in a process of persuasion, not inquiry, and they have an agenda. CSICOP looks at these people very carefully. Should we collaborate with them? No.\" James Alcock (York University, Toronto) described why parapsychology, despite its long history of research, some of it involving eminent scientists, still has gained no status as a science and is in fact ignored by most scientists. There is no unambiguous definition of a psi phenom\u00ad enon, no strongly replicated effect, no theory offered, no consistency with other areas of science, and no progressive accu\u00ad mulation of knowledge. \"Despite a long history, parapsychology does not have a single acknowledged 'fact,'\" said Alcock. Furthermore, he said that collabora\u00ad tion with is difficult. \"Parapsychologists psi,\" he lamented. \"To diem, finding nothing doesn't count.... We can help by being respectful and constructive and by being hard-nosed and critical. But the problem is that the failure to find supporting evidence will not dampen parapsychological zeal.\" The session on investigating historical mysteries featured several interesting case studies. CSICOP's senior research fellow and SI \"Investigative Files\" columnist Joe Nickell reported on his investigations into such cases as the Flatwood Monster, the Nazca lines, and the Shroud of Turin. Researcher Mariano Tomatis (Turin, Italy) described his investigations into the \"Da Vinci code\" story, and Luigi 6 January/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER NEWS AND COMMENT Garlaschelii (University of Pavia) described his literally hands-on investiga\u00ad tions into the \"real sword in the stone\" (in Italy). Randi's previously mentioned talk followed. We hope to have articles based on several of these presentations in future issues. In the \"Hoaxes, Fakes, and Myths\" session, archaeologist Kenneth Feder (Central Connecticut State University) gave a revealing report on media dynam\u00ad ics intriguingly and accurately titled \"Atlantis in Fantasyland: Making a Mickey Mouse Television Documentary About the Lost Continent.\" He told of his experiences a few years ago with a producer of an ABC television docu\u00ad mentary about Atlantis. The producer told Feder he was looking for an archae\u00ad ologist who was pro-Atlantis. Feder told him there were none, because Atlantis didn't exist. When Feder asked why diey made rJiat request, the producer pointed out that the ABC network was owned by the Disney company, which was about to launch its animated film about Atlantis and implied that they expected ABC to make a documentary that The World of Galileo Galilei As befitted a conference outside Padua, the first evening featured a nearly three-hour special event, \"The World of Galileo Galilei.\" It was hosted by Piero Angela, a noted Rome-based television journalist in Italy, author of books on science and skep\u00ad ticism, and one of the key people responsi\u00ad ble for the rounding of CI CAP Paul Kurtz calb him \"the Walter Cronkite of Italy,\" and Angela's knowledgeable on-stage inter\u00ad views and hosted demonstrations with leading Galileo scholars and even an actor playing Galileo showed why. Angela first interviewed Maria Mariapiera Marenzana, a professor of literature in Rome and a biographer of Galileo, about Galileos life and work. Oxford University Press will publish her book in English in 2005. Not only was Galileo a great man of science with notable discoveries on the principle of inertia, the fall of free bodies. and the pendulum as well as the works for which he was even better known, \"He was a Renaissance man par excellence\" she said. He had enormous curiosity, she said, \"He was a great writer, and he could sing, paint, and write poetry.\" She was soon joined on the stage by her husband. Andrea Frova, professor of physics at the University of Rome who holds the same chair once held by Enrico Fermi. He spoke in more detail about Galileo's work, referring to the astonishing variety of his inquiries. He even noted that Galileo occasionally was wrong. \"Galileo studied so many things he couldn't always be right. He believed planetary orbits were circles, and he made a wrong guess about the rides. He thought they were due to Earth's rotation. This shows diat everyone can make mistakes.\" Angela next introduced Alessandro Bettini, professor of physics at the University of Padua, who had brought a large wooden inclined plane plus measur\u00ad ing instruments like diosc Galileo had used in his experiments demonstrating that objects fell at the same velocity regardless of theit weight. Bettini demonstrated dicir use and said. \"The scientific method was the major contribution of Galileo.\" These discussions were interspersed with dips from a linle-known Italian motion pic\u00ad ture about Galileo's life and his conflict with church authorities, a movie Angela said was not well known even in Italy. It ended with the trial of Galileo. The Holy Office found him \"vehemently suspected of heresy\" for \"having held and believed the doctrine which would leave open the possibility that Atlantis was real. (For critiques of both the ABC show and the Atlantis myth, see SI, January/February 2002.) One of the highlights for many members of the audience was moving talks by two speakers from Egypt, Mourad Whaba (professor emeritus of philosophy at the University of Ain Shams in Cairo and president of the Afro-Asian Philosophy Association) and Mona Abousenna, a professor at the same university. Abousenna described the extraordinary challenges and perils is false and contrary to the Sacred and Divine scriptures, that the Sun is the center of the worid and does not move from east to west and that the Earth moves and is not the cen\u00ad ter of the worid.\" Galileo is shown the Inquisition's instruments of torture and men seen reading his hand-written confession and recantation \"abjuring\" any such beliefs. \"I curse and detest the said errors and heresies\" and will \"never again say nor assert in speak\u00ad ing or writing such things,\" he was required to state. It was an emotional end to the evening. CSICOP's Paul Kurtz was visibly moved. He told me CICAP should be praised for presenting the Galileo tribute because the Galileo affair is still a sensitive issue in Italy. And he again mentioned Galileo's great courage. \"The trial of Galileo was a terrible thing. It ruined him.\" \u2014K.F. Piero Angela interviews Galileo biographer Maria Manapiera Mareruana.

Many seemed moved by her courage and determina\u00ad tion. In answer to a question, Professor Whaba said, \"My students like me, but they don't like my ideas.\" At the same session was Prof. Edward Kruglyakov of the Russian Academy of Sciences, who reported on efforts by Russian scientists to criticize anti-science, and Li Sheng Xian, a representative of a five-member Chinese delegation. The conference concluded with a lively session of critical examinations of evidence about alternative medicine. A few excerpts: Edzard Ernst (Professor of Comple\u00ad mentary and Alternative Medicine, Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, U.K.) On herbal remedies: \"We have convincing positive data for nine herbal remedies (especially St. John's Wort, for mild to moderate depression), but not thousands [as frequently claimed].\" On acupuncture: \"There is limited evidence that acupuncture is better than no treatment at all. There is inconclusive evidence that acupuncture is better than a placebo.\" On spiritual healing: \"The majority of rigorous trials show no effect beyond placebo.\" Ernst's conclusion: \"High quality re\u00ad search is scarce. Bias is rife. For some CAM [Complementary and Alternative Medicine] treatments the risk/benefit ratio is positive. But for most, we don't know.\" Barry Beyerstein (Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, British Colum\u00ad bia): \"The curriculum of the Dominion Herbal College in Vancouver\u2014the lead- Massimo Polidoro and James Randi ham it up after the evening special tribute to Randi. Randi: That's Amazing The special event the second night was \"Randi: That's Amazing,\" billed as \"A 'Magical' who've seen Randi's lec\u00ad tures many times, this was different. It was very interesting because its essence was an extended conversation between Randi and CICAP's Massimo Polidoro (investigator, author, and Si's \"Notes on a Strange World\" columnist who once studied with Randi). Both were seated com\u00ad fortably on the stage; Polidoro would ask questions about Randi's life and career, and Randi, now seventy-six but still going strong, answered. The questions were cued to some \"amazing\" old film clips shown of Randi in action, some going back to when he was only a teenager doing conjuring tricks in Toronto, and others long before he became the white-bearded scourge of psychics he is today. Many showed his career as an escape artist, including film of him escaping from a straitjacket while being suspended upside down over Niagara Falls in winter and another of him encased in a huge block of ice with those outside frantically trying to chip him out. Ray Hyman, Richard Wiseman, and Joe Nickell came on stage and performed demonstrations and conjuring tricks. This, of course, then led in to discussion of Randi's later, still-active career as a debunker of magicians who pretend to be psychic such as Uri Geller. Randi even revealed to the audience exactly how he did two Geller-type tricks when forced into doing so on live radio and television shows with little or no time to prepare. It truly was a \"magical\" evening.\u2014K.F. ing college of herbalism in North America\u2014exhibits every characteristic of pseudoscience in [CSICOP (University of Flor\u00ad ence): \"Homeopathy is useful. ... It is useful to the industry, to the sellers, and to the homeopaths. But it is highly questionable if it is of use to patients.\" Wallace Sampson (professor of med\u00ad icine, Stanford, and editor of the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine) gave a blunt assessment of what he calls \"the political takeover in the U.S.\" by alternative medicine. \"Never in the history of medicine has there been anything like this before,\" he said. \"It is an organized invasion of pseudoscience into the scientific edifice of medicine. It is pervasive, surreptitious, and purposeful. It is not a conspiracy; it is simply the way people act in groups.\" How do they do it? By using the \"language of distortion\" (alternative medicine instead of quackery or pseudo- science) and by demeaning science (post\u00ad modernism and relativism), he said. Proponents' invention of language is cal\u00ad culated to produce a positive response. He said they have become astute in what he called \"info-ganda,\" the combination of information and propaganda. They have been effective in manipulating opinion in nonprofit foundations, the news media, books, and even the med\u00ad ical press, which \"has a bias against pub\u00ad lishing negative articles.\" They have found abundant sources of funding bodi from government (especially in the U.S., through the support of key con\u00ad gressional leaders) and from spiritual/ religious organizations. He sees the problem getting worse, not better. Silvio Garattini, professor of phar\u00ad macology and director of the Mario Negri Institute in Milan, summed up the session. \"I wonder if by using gen\u00ad tler terms like alternative medicine and complementary medicine, we are dis\u00ad serving science,\" he said. \"'Quackery' 8 January/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER NEWS AND COMMENT and 'fakery'\" is what we are talking about. \"We must use what has proved to be effective.\" And he spoke of the frustrating illogic of homeopathy. Its remedies are \"all the same and contain nothing.

Mack\u2014whose position as a Harvard psychiatrist seemed to add legitimacy to his endorsement of alien abduction claims\u2014was killed acciden\u00ad tally in London on September 27, 2004. He had been attending the T.E. Lawrence Society Symposium in Oxford. On returning to die London home where he was staying, he stepped into a crosswalk and was hit by a car dri\u00ad ven by an allegedly intoxicated driver. He was apparently killed instantly. Mack (b. Oct. 4, 1929) received his medical degree, cum laude, from Harvard in 1955. His biography of T.E. Lawrence (\"Lawrence of Arabia\"), A Prince of Our Disorder, won him a Pulitzer Prize in 1977. In 1994 Mack shocked colleagues and others with his book Abductions: Human Encounters with Aliens. He had come to believe that many of his patients had indeed had extraterrestrial encounters which they \"remembered\" under hypnosis. Mack was invited to speak at a CSI- COP conference in Seatde, Washington, in 1994. Psychologist Robert A. Baker began the session on alien abductions by observing that virtually all such claims represented a psychological phenome\u00ad non attributable to the discredited pro\u00ad cedure of hypnotic regression. \"Once you turn on the imagination,\" he said, \"all diings are possible.\" Baker also observed that \"waking dreams\" (which occur in the twilight between being fully awake and fully sleep) can yield apparitions of extra\u00ad terrestrials as well as produce sensations of floating, falling, or being rendered immobile\u2014effects often associated widi alleged alien abductions. Mack, however, dismissed such attempts to find conventional psycho\u00ad logical explanations for abduction experiences, insisting that the cases had \"a quality of their own.\" In addi\u00ad tion to defending his position, he asserted that \"There is a world of other dimensions, of other realities that can cross over into our own world.\" He asked his skeptical audience, \"Are we seeking to be rhe arbiters of reality?\" In response, CSICOP Chairman Paul Kurtz, who moderated the session, briefly noted that skeptics were merely applying the scientific method to para\u00ad normal claims. Mack's book led the Harvard Medical School to consider censuring him, but after a fourteen-month investi\u00ad gation the school declined on the grounds of \"academic freedom.\" After Mack's death, the attorney who repre\u00ad sented him during the investigation, Roderick MacLeish, stated: \"He was so caring to his patients, and I hope that is what he is remembered for, and not for being the guy who believed in people's stories of alien abductions.\" \u2014JoeNickell Joe Nickell is CSlCOP's Senior Research Fellow.

The Center for Inquiry - Transnational announces a major 13,600 square foot expansion at its Amherst, New York, head\u00ad quarters. Slated for completion during 2005, the $2.54 million expansion will more than double conference and seminar capacity, add ten urgently-needed new offices, and enlarge the Center's world- class libraries. This capital project will relieve serious overcrowding and capac\u00ad ity problems, supporting projected pro\u00ad gram growth of the Center and its affiliate organizations, including the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, for years to come. We are bursting at the seams, and can\u00ad not continue program growth without expanding our headquarters. The shelf space of our skeptical and freethought library\u2014the finest in the world\u2014is full. Yet donated books, magazines, and archival materials keep coming. There's an office or workstation everywhere we can put one, yet program and staffing needs con\u00ad tinue to grow. Our existing conference and seminar space, opened in 1995, is often overwhelmed by larger and more complex events. The headquarters expansion is one focus of our $26.26 million New Future Fund capital campaign. Your gift to the New Future Fund today will help to make our desperately-needed headquarters expansion a reality. We seek gifts of cash, publicly-traded securities, paid-up insur\u00ad ance policies, and other assets. Attractive incentive and naming opportunities are offered in acknowledgment of larger gifts.

NEWS AND COMMENT made-for-TV movie (starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons). The case served as a model for thousands of subsequent abduction reports over the following decades. The Hills's psychiatrist, Benjamin Simon, concluded they had experienced a \"shared dream\" and, indeed specific inconsistencies in Bettys story are charac\u00ad teristic of dreaming. Since she recalled numerous particular details, while her husband recalled very little. Dr. Simon said that the \"abduction\" was not a shared experience, rather it indicated Barney had obtained his knowledge of the incident after he repeatedly heard his wife tell her nightmares to neighbors and friends. Betty Hill also recalled a \"star map\" exhibited by one the aliens which she later drew from memory. Subsequently, after a six-year search, an Ohio school\u00ad teacher and amateur astronomer, Marjorie Fish, believed she had found matches for some of the dots and circles on Betty's drawing, including our sun and a planet of Zeta 2 Reticuli that was seemingly the aliens' home base. Noted astronomer Carl Sagan and a Cornell University graduate student reported that a computer plot of fifteen star positions identified by Fish showed \"little similar\u00ad ity\" to those marked on Betty's drawing. Betty Hill was not only an excellent hypnotic subject but she also exhibited many other traits associated with a fan\u00ad tasy-prone personality. For years she believed UFOs followed and communi\u00ad cated with her, as she related in her pri\u00ad vately published 1995 book, A Common Sense Approach to UFOs. \u2014Joe Nickell Critics Ravage 'Hoax' New Age Film An independent film directed and pro\u00ad duced by followers of the New Age chan- neller/guru J.Z. Knight called What the Bleep Do We Know? was released last February (and is still in theaters). The film, a bizarre blend of mysticism and quantum physics, has became a minor hit and earned about $4.4 million in the first six months of release. Some of the \"scientists\" featured were reportedly unhappy with the way they were por\u00ad trayed by the filmmakers and said that they were not clear what they were par\u00ad ticipating in. Skeptics were, of course, less than impressed with the film (see review \"What the #$*! Do They Know?\" September/October 2004), but even given the New Agey over\u00ad tones, audiences and critics have been slow to embrace it. What the Bleep?s director and producers have focused on grassroots publicity efforts and cast themselves as film mavericks who will show up a Hollywood that was not high- minded enough to embrace their ideas. It's perhaps not surprising that a cult-like film would achieve a cult-like fol\u00ad lowing, and it seems that much of the revenue is gener\u00ad ated not by new filmgoers but by repeat ones trying to figure out just what the film is try\u00ad ing to say. Meyer Gottlieb, president of independent film distributor Samuel Goldwyn Films, said that he attended a Los Angeles screening and met hundreds of people who \"told me that the movie had an impact on their lives. Many had seen it two or three times.\" One devotee, a sixty-two-year-old Californian who has seen the film twelve times, said, \"It's a relief to get out of the [constant] barrage of negative news and explore the deep connections between mind, body and spirit. . . . The movie is such an aberra\u00ad tion for Hollywood, a world driven by fear and the bottom line.\" Mainstream filmgoers have more or less ignored the film, while the critics have almost universally panned it. Maitland McDonagh, of TV Guide, says the film \"quickly tumbles down a rabbit hole of annoying psychobabble, dubious science, and embarrassingly silly anima\u00ad tion.\" Washington Post critic Michael O'Sullivan described the film as \"Part talking-head documentary, part live- action narrative featurette and part goofy animation [that] fails on all three levels...stiffly written, badly acted, choppily edited, and awkwardly redun\u00ad dant. . .On the whole, it feels like a cross between a PBS special hosted by a series of low-rent Deepak Chopras and an infomercial for self-help audio tapes. Bleep, indeed.\" Nick Schager of Slant magazine concluded that, \"If people are truly able to construct their own des\u00ad tinies, then I can only hope that What the Bleep, with its hokey and derivative CGI, John Tesh-influenced score, and screeching electronic sound effects, will beget a future devoid of these filmmak\u00ad ers' creepily cultish work.\" Because the reviews have been over\u00ad whelmingly negative, ads for the film are deceptive and take blurbs out of context to suggest critical praise. The Los Angeles Times, for example, is quoted as calling the film \"Mind-Bending!\" though a look at the actual review (by Kevin Crust) is decidedly less enthusiastic: \"It's easy to question how much further you wish to SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 11 NEWS AND COMMENT go with the movie. . . . The journey pro\u00ad duces more questions than answers [and is] a mixed bag .. . fraught with an excessive amount of navel-gazing.\" Film critic Roger Ebert called the film a \"hoax\" and published a readers comment (apparently one of many) that said, \"There's little to no accurate sci\u00ad ence in the film, and, as a physicist pointed out recently, the individuals who are quoted are pretty far from qual\u00ad ified experts on the field of quantum mechanics. Case in point: One of the persons expounding on causality and quantum physics ... is a chiropractor.\" Ebert responded, \"I knew there had to be something fishy when the expert who made the most sense was channeling a 35,000-year-old seer from Atlantis.\" \u2014Benjamin Radford Benjamin Radford has been a film critic since 1994; his reviews are available at www. radfordreviews. com. Paranormal Expo Cancelled Under Cloud When the promoters of the paranor- mal-chemed Paraworld Expo an\u00ad nounced its event at the Los Angeles Convention Center to be held October 21 through 24, 2004, Sherri Andrews and Wendy Hughes of the Independent Investigations Group at CFl-West had to see it for themselves. According to the promotional literature, \"For the first time in history, ParaWorldExpo LLC will bring together more than fifty of the world's leading pioneers and experts in a vast spectrum of paranor\u00ad mal topics. An estimated 250,000 indi\u00ad viduals from around the globe will embark on a four-day adventure.\" Where else could you find exhibits about ghosts and hauntings, UFOs and extraterrestrials, past lives, mediumship demonstrations, angel communication, and tarot all under one roof? This event would be the Shangri-la of psychics, the Valhalla of remote viewers, the Elysium of exorcists. Fate stepped in, for the Expo was not to be. When Vaughn Rees of CFI- West warned that conference was not listed on the Convention Center Web site, and that the Paraworld Web site had been taken down, Hughes called the convention cen\u00ad ter in early September and was told that the event was no longer listed on their computer calendar. She and Andrews can- ceiled the payments for their tickets, and found that the phone numbers for Paraworld had been disconnected. Leslie Inzunza, who was hired to help organize the event, said she and many others were trying to locate Paraworld organizer Steven Doolittle. Though at least some of the tickets to the Expo have been refunded, as of this writing, several vendors\u2014some of whom paid $2,500 for a booth\u2014are trying to get their money back. Apparently, the participants' pow\u00ad ers of perception and prediction were on hiatus when they paid Doolittle for the 2004 Paraworld Expo. Maybe the remote viewers will locate him. . . . \u2014fames Underdown James Underdown is Executive Director the Center for Inquiry-West in Los Angeles. Raelian Update: Sex, Pseudoscience, and Sacrilege Raelian Sex In 1950s sci-fi movies, aliens brought mankind gifts like solutions to world peace and the cure for cancer. In the new millennium, they just want us to have a lot of sex. The October 2004 issue of Playboy featured the other\u00ad worldly Raelians, a UFO group known for its standards of free and open sexual\u00ad ity as well as its belief that life on Earth was engineered by space aliens. The Raelians are, however, best known for the 2002 cloning scandal, when Clonaid\u2014a company founded by the group's leader, Rael\u2014gained worldwide notoriety for making unsubstantiated claims of having successfully cloned human beings. Three Raelian women are featured in the Playboy pictorial, including Marina Boisselier, the daughter of Clonaid CEO Brigitte Boisselier, and Sophie, who has been the life companion of Rael for the past thirteen years. At a September 19, 2004, press con\u00ad ference in Montreal, Rael spoke \"on the topic of nudity and spirituality,\" and praised Hugh Hefner, Playboy's pub\u00ad lisher, for \"his commendable actions aimed at breaking sexual taboos and for actively taking part in the evolution of lifestyles.\" Rael awarded Hefner (in absentia) the title of \"Honorary Priest.\" Inquiring minds want to know: will a UFO landing pad be installed at the Playboy mansion anytime soon? Raelian Pseudoscience The Raelians have recently taken up a new cause, Intelligent Design (ID), and are now actively advocating equal time for ID theory in classrooms around the world. On September 21, 2004, the U.S. Raelian Movement announced that the Raelians support \"academic debates\" about Intelligent Design and evolution, and equal time for ID in the classroom. A press release cited a recent paper on Intelligent Design by Stephen C. Meyer, director and Senior Fellow of the Center for Science and Culture at the Discovery Institute in Seattle, in which he argues that \"no current mate\u00ad rialistic theory of evolution can account for the origin of the informa\u00ad tion necessary to build novel animal forms.\" The Raelians put a naturalis\u00ad tic\u2014and curious\u2014twist on ID that Meyer and his Discovery Institute brethren might not have anticipated: One of the major arguments against The Theory of Intelligent Design has been that it went against the 'naturalism philosophy'. . . . The Raelian Movement would like to underscore that the Theory of Intelligent Design does not lead to a supernatural designer but to an extraterrestrial human civilization designer, which is in line with 12 January/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER NEWS AND COMMENT Rael, the spiritual leader of the international Raelian Movement, poses in front of a giant UFO. AFP PHOTO/CLONAID 'naturalism philosophy.' One day, maybe sooner than you might imag\u00ad ine possible, we will go to other planets and scientifically engineer life on them. Then, probably, these worlds will create deistic religions from the interactions we will have with them. After this, they will develop an evolutionary theory to escape from the supernaturalistic view of their ancestors, and finally, they will discover that life on their planet was indeed designed\u2014but by us, human beings who came from another world, the Earth. . . . The Raelians plan to launch a series of ongoing debates throughout schools and universities on Intelligent Design, and state that the \"whole world\" will benefit from a \"healthy\" educational sys\u00ad tem where both evolution and ID arc taught, arguing that students have \"the right to know.\" Perhaps the next time Discovery Institute representatives go to school board hearings arguing for the teaching of Intelligent Design, SKEPTICAL INQUIRER readers might make a point of attending and reminding Christian board members and parents in the audi\u00ad ence that ID is the \"theory\" of choice for the largest atheist, pro-cloning, free-love UFO group in the world. Raelian Sacrilege Rael stormed off the set of the Quebec television show Tout le Monde en Parle (The Whole World's Talking about It), after editorial cartoonist Serge Chapleau began to have fun at His Holiness's expense. After making fun of Rael's otherworldly clothing and hairdo, saying \"It's an old dream of men to sleep with a lot of loose women at the same time . . . but if I have to and hairdo .. . forget it,\" Chapleau grabbed hold of the tight bun on Rael's head. Rael has filed a complaint against Chapleau for \"physical aggression\" and written a letter to CBC demanding a public apology. \u2014Kevin Christopher Kevin Christopher is Public Relations Director for CSICOP. Metabolife Founder Michael Ellis Charged with Lying to FDA On top of having the product his com\u00ad pany takes its name from banned (see News and Comment, SI, March/April 2004), Michael J. Ellis, founder of Metabolife International, is now facing charges of lying to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the safety record of that product, ephedra-based Metabolife 356. In a press release issued by the office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of California (Carol C. Lam), dated July 22, 2004, a grand jury \"returned an eight-count indictment\" against Ellis and his company. Ellis and an attorney representing Metabolife entered pleas of not guilty on all counts in federal court on July 27. Under the original indictment, both Ellis and his company each faced eight charges: six counts of \"making false, fic\u00ad titious and fraudulent representations to the Food and Drug Administration\" and two of \"corruptly endeavoring to influ\u00ad ence, obstruct, and impede proceedings concerning the regulation of dietary supplements containing ephedra being conducted by the FDA.\" Federal District Court Judge Napoleon Jones has since dismissed the latter two counts because they lacked specificity, and con\u00ad solidated the other counts, saying that they did not constitute separate acts. Metabolife 356 was first formulated by Ellis in 1989 and quickly became one of the top-selling diet aids in America. However, dangerously adverse reactions began to be reported by its users and their families, ranging from elevated heart rate to death. In a letter to die FDA in February 1999, Ellis wrote, \"Metabolife has never been made aware of any adverse health events by consumers of its prod\u00ad ucts.\" However, the FDA contends that Ellis had reports of some of these adverse reactions (\"at least 138\" according to a congressional report released in October 2002), but failed to report them to a con\u00ad gressional investigation. That document also notes that (at die rime of that report) \"Metabolife records include nearly 2,000 reports of significant adverse reactions to Metabolife products,\" thai \"many of the significant adverse events involve con\u00ad sumers who were young, in good health. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 200$ 13 NEWS AND COMMENT and taking recommended dosages\" when the events occurred. Furthermore, \"Metabolife's handling of the adverse event reports exhibits indifference to the health of consumers\" (see www. democrats.reform.house.gov/Documents /20040827102309-56026.pdf for fur\u00ad ther details of these findings). Though the ban went into effect in April of this year, the company continues to market other diet\u00ad ary supplements, including non- ephedra-based appetite suppressants and Metabolife Starch Buster, a prod\u00ad uct the company claims reduces the absorption of carbohydrates. In a related development, a new study using dogs has provided addi\u00ad tional evidence that ephedrine can kill. When the drug was administered to healthy dogs, no bad effects were noted, but when dogs with reversible, artificially induced arterial blockages were given the compound, fibrillation, or elevated heart rates, were observed\u2014 in some cases, potentially lethal rates. Arterial blockages can occur naturally in humans without being detected, and, judging by this evidence, anyone with such a blockage who took an ephedrine-based compound for weight loss could be in danger of suf\u00ad fering fatal cardiac arrest. The report was published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology on October 26, 2004. \u2014David Park Musella David Park Musella is an editorial assis\u00ad tant with SKEPTICAL INQUIRER. Psychics (Don't) Explain Missing September 11 While going though files on psychics a few months ago, I came across a newspa\u00ad per article listing annual psychic predic\u00ad tions\u2014in and of itself, an unremarkable find. The article appeared in die Weekly Alibi (Albuquerque, New Mexico) and featured predictions from local psychics for die following year. What made this particular article interesting was the year being predicted: 2001, in an issue dated January 11-17. Dozens of predictions were made; some were right, some were wrong, most of them were obvious, vague, or impossible to verify. But all the psychics somehow missed what in retro\u00ad spect was the most important event of 2001, a watershed moment in American (and indeed geopolitical) history: the ter\u00ad rorist attacks of September 11. There were five psychics featured in die Alibi piece; one of them is conve\u00ad niently anonymous (he goes by \"N.\"), and another has since died and therefore can't answer questions. The remaining three are described in the article: \"Alan Oken is a psychic and social commentator 'whose real work is in the development of consciousness.' He has been in the field for more than thirty years, has written twelve books, speaks seven languages, and lectures worldwide six months out of the year.'\" \"Martha Woodworth is a tarot reader and astrologer specializing in career, cre\u00ad ativity and relationship advice. She has twenty years' experience in the field and has taught the psychic crafts at Santa Fe Community College for seven years. She is also a psychic detective who has appeared on Unsolved Mysteries, was the 'Psychic Adviser' columnist for New Woman magazine.\" \"Stan Alexander is a local psychic specializing in private readings\u2014tarot, palm, runes, and numerology. He has been featured in several international publications and television programs and has been a headlining entertainer at nightclubs and other venues across the country.\" As the third anniversary of the attacks approached, I contacted the remaining three by e-mail on August 18, 2004, to ask about their spectacular fail\u00ad ures: \"I read through all of them, and couldn't help but notice that you (and all the other psychics) somehow missed the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. I was won\u00ad dering if you had any explanation or comment on this, as it seems very strange that so many prominent psy\u00adchics would all miss such an event of global importance.\" All three gamely replied: Alan Oken stated that, \"Simply stated\u2014 I am not a psychic and did not make any psychic predictions.\" (This is a curious statement, given that the article clearly refers to him as a psychic and lists \"Alan Oken's Predictions.\") Martha Woodworth wrote only, \"No. I don't [have an explanation].\" Stan Alexander, voted \"Best Psychic\" in a 1999 poll of the newspaper's read\u00ad ers, suggested that he did in fact have an inkling of the events but did not want to publicize the results of his prophetic gift: \"While many, including myself, may have had intuited something along those lines taking place, it is not some\u00ad thing that one puts out as it can cause too much potential alarm and panic. Anybody demonstrating responsibility will know that predictions are not an exact science and as such, caution in what is to be put in print must be demonstrated.\" (He had information that might have saved thousands of people's lives and changed the course of history but didn't want to create alarm and panic?) I did a Web search and found the article online at http://alibi.com/ alibi/2001-01-1 l/feature_section.html. The predictions had been easily avail\u00ad able for the world to see since January 2001. Oddly, only a few weeks after I asked the psychics about their failed predictions, the page had been removed from the Weekly Alibi Web site (those from other years are still there). This action may just be a coincidence, or perhaps the Weekly Alibi received a request from one of the embarrassed psychics who asked them to remove his or her glaringly wrong predictions. Though much harder to find, the site is archived elsewhere and still accessible \u2014Benjamin INVESTIGATIVE FILES JOE NICKELL Mystery Painting: The Shadow of the Cross' An enigmatic painting is exhibited at the church of San Francisco de Asis (St. Francis of Assisi) at Ranchos de Taos, New Mexico (figure 1). It depicts a barefoot Jesus stand\u00ad ing by the Sea of Galilee; how\u00ad ever, when the lights are extin\u00ad guished, the background lumi\u00ad nesces as if the sky and sea were shining in moonlight, and the fig\u00ad ure becomes silhouetted, a cross appearing at the left shoulder and a halo over the head (Michell 1979, 94; Colombo 1999, 70-72). (See figure 2.) Other mysterious effects are sometimes reported as well. Background Known as \"The Shadow of the Cross,\" the life-size painting was created in 1896 by an obscure French-Canadian artist named Henri Ault (d. ca. 1912), who had a studio in the Cobalt, Ontario, region (Rawson 1914, 615-616). Ault is said to have denied being responsible for the effect, which he claimed to have discovered (quite fortuitously) upon entering his studio one night. \"He believed he was going mad, and he was never able to explain the reason for the transformation,\" states writer John Michell (1979, 94). Reportedly, British scientist and gullible spiritualist William Crookes Figure 1. Historic mission church of San Francisco de Ranchos de Taos, New Mexico, is home to a \"mystery pa (Photo by Joe Nickell) (1832-1919) was the first to attempt\u2014 unsuccessfully\u2014to explain the painting (Michell 1979, 94), which toured Europe and was supposedly an attrac\u00ad tion at die 1904 Worlds Fair in St. Louis. A church brochure claims: \"It is not known what causes the background to be luminous. It was painted before radium was discovered and when tested with Geiger counters the results have been negative\" (Shadow n.d.). Sources even allege that more extensive scientific examinations have been conducted, utilizing \"Geiger counters, light tests and scrapings\"\u2014all to no avail (Michell 1979, 94). However as reported by New Mexico Magazine, while a church archi\u00ad vist claimed the painting had once been analyzed \"for all known luminescent substances,\" she conceded \"she had no docu\u00ad mentation of the testing and was not sure who did the test or when\" (Gaussoin 1998). Such alleged analyses appear to be apocryphal, representing at\u00ad tempts to convince the credulous that science is trumped by super\u00ad natural mystery. In 1948 the picture was donated to the church, and in the early 1980s it was relocated in a room of the adjacent parish hall, furnished witft folding chairs. A videotape provides an introduc\u00ad tion to the local parish. When the lights are turned out, and die background begins to glow, subjective impressions can prevail. Observes one source (Crystal 2003): \"Soon the silhouette of Jesus grows three-dimensional and appears more Joe Nickell is CSICOP's Senior Research Fellow and author of numerous investigative hooks, including Looking for a Miracle. Asis in inting.\" SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 15 like a dark statue than flat image. His robes seem to billow in the breeze. ...\" The church takes a cautious view of the phenomenon, and there are no reported healing cures associated with the painting. Pilgrims' reactions vary. Some exclaim \"It's a miracle!\" says archivist Corina Santistevan. \"There are those who are very touched and very moved and very reverent,\" she says. \"And those who continue to be skepti\u00ad cal. And those who are curious and want a scientific explanation\" (Chavez 2002). Investigation I was among the latter group. I visited the historic church on October 27, 2003, accompanied by colleague Vaughn Rees. While photographs\u2014and certainly actual examinations of the painting\u2014are not permitted, we man\u00ad aged to get a close look by staying for two showings and the interval between. Some of the picture's touted myster\u00ad ies are easily explained, such as our docent's claim that Jesus' eyes follow the viewer wherever he or she stands. That is merely the result of a three-dimensional view being \"fixed\" in a two-dimensional representation, and any such portrait in which the subject's eyes gaze directly at the viewer will produce the same effect (Nickell 2003). The picture is also said to appear more intense the longer one views it, but that would be expected due to the viewer's eyes becoming accustomed to the dark. In the mottled background of the painting, some see a boat, angels, or other images, but these are simply simu\u00ad lacra: pictures perceived, Rorschach- like, in random patterns. Some people report seeing the image of Jesus \"vibrate,\" the docent told us; however, that is attributable to the well-known autokinetic effect, in which a stationary light in the dark appears to be moving, due to slight, involuntary eye move\u00ad ments (Schick and Vaughn 1999, 45). All such effects may be augmented by the power of suggestion. Regarding the appearance of the halo and cross, it must be noted that\u2014 contrary to some sources (e.g., Michell 1979, 94; Crystal 2003)\u2014the halo is always visible, consisting of a simple out\u00ad lined ellipse. It merely becomes silhou\u00ad etted when the background luminesces. Such an effect\u2014as my own experiments demonstrated\u2014could easily be created by painting the halo outline with ordi\u00ad nary, opaque paint over a background Figure 2. Before-and-after photos of the transformational painting, \"The Shadow of the Cross,\" illustrate a mystery that supposedly baffles science. (Photos reproduced courtesy of Sarbo Photography, Albuquerque, N.M.) rendered with a phosphorescent (glow- in-the-dark) one. The same principle could explain the appearing-cross effect, except in that case the phosphorescent paint would need to visibly match that of the non-glowing background areas\u2014something easy for an artist to accomplish. This was my pre\u00ad ferred hypothesis to explain the mystery, after I first learned of it from Canadian writer John Robert Colombo (1996). Supporting this hypothesis is the observation that the painting's back\u00ad ground\u2014in contrast to the other areas\u2014is badly cracked and flaking, consistent with its having a different composition. (Underneath, where the upper layer has flaked off, is a very bright blue, whose presence suggests the picture was repainted\u2014as with a phos\u00ad phorescent paint.)' Further corrobora\u00ad tive evidence comes from the fact that the glowing of the paint begins to diminish after a few minutes\u2014just like phosphorescent paint\u2014and must be re- exposed to light for the effect to con\u00ad tinue (Casper 2004). Proponents' insistence that the picture was created before radium was discovered (by Pierre and Marie Curie in 1898) is largely irrelevant, since non-radium luminous paints had long been available commercially. The first, Balmain's paint (a calcium sulfide phosphor to which was added a small amount of a bismuth com\u00ad pound as an \"activator\") Lumi\u00ad nescence 1960). In 1879 an awarded \"for the use of phos\u00ad phorescent salts, such as sulphid [sulfide] of lime, of strontium, barium, etc., for the purpose of illumination by mixing them with paint or varnish ...\" (Phos\u00ad phorescent 1879).2 Although in 1896 Ault's \"The Shadow of the Cross\" was a novelty, some modern artists now produce lumi\u00ad nous paintings as a special genre (Duffy 1995), and there are commercial trans\u00ad formational pictures (such as a \"daylight\" seascape that, in the dark, becomes a \"sunset\" scene using four glow-in-the- dark colors [Spilsbury 1997]). MYSTERY PAINTING: THE SHADOW OF THE CROSS' Continued on page 21 16 January/February 200S SKEPTICAL INQUIRER PSYCHIC VIBRATIONS ROBERT SHEAFFER Hurricane Osama? With the recent devastating and remarkable assault on Florida by one destructive hurricane after another, some are ques\u00ad tioning whether there might not be some yet-unexplained reason behind so much misery. Joseph Trainor, editor of the Webzine UFO Roundup, observed that \"The band of high pressure in the Atlantic stretches from Cabo Verde all the way to Florida, which is really unusual ... it creates a kind of 'con\u00ad veyor belt' carrying the storms all the way across and then shooting them up into the Caribbean\" (see www.ufoinfo. com/roundup/v09/rnd0938.shtml). What could be the cause of this? One possibility is suggested by the fact that UFO Roundup received three emails from readers who claimed to have heard the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) broadcast\u00ad ing from Alaska on September 14, on a frequency of 3.390 MHz. HAARP is an unclassified program managed by the Air Force Research Laboratory and the Office of Naval Research (see www. haarp.alaska.edu/haarp/faq.html). But according to conspiracy theorists, it is also involved in mind control and weather modification. Wearers of tinfoil hats presumably wear them to block sig\u00ad nals from HAARP (which are just high- powered short-wave radio transmis\u00ad sions). \"Personally I don't think HAARP power to 'steer' a hurricane,\" said Trainor. \"But the Tuesday burst might have deflected [hurricane] Ivan away from its original projected landfall around Tampa.\" Yet Trainor can suggest another even more remarkable theory: \"Other than aliens, I can think of only one source able to create and sustain that unusual Bermuda High over the Atlantic\u2014 Shambhala, the hidden city of mystics in Afghanistan. Shambhala is reputed to have access to the weather-modification technology of ancient Atlantis. There have also been reports of Osama Bin Laden hiding out occasionally in Shambhala. Osama might have per\u00ad suaded the Shambhalans to use 'weather warfare' against the USA. Is it just a coincidence that the 'hurricane blitz' began on August 3, the same date Allied forces stepped up their offensive in Afghanistan?... I just find it extremely interesting that Hurricane Ivan's worst fury descended upon the old Jewish syn\u00ad agogue in Pensacola, Fla., as if Osama planned it that way.\" Evidence of another quite inexplica\u00ad ble conspiracy at work has just recently come to light. On September 28, Dr. John Mack, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard University and one of the lead\u00ad ing promoters of \"UFO abduction\" sto\u00ad ries, was struck by a car and killed while crossing a street in London (sec News and Comment, page 9). Mack was in London to speak at a conference about T.E. Lawrence (\"Lawrence of Arabia\"), about whom he had written a Pulitzer Prize-winning book (see www.john emackinstitute.org). The incident seems to be a random tragic accident, as Mack was in a crosswalk and the driver was reported to be intoxicated. But almost immediately, some UFOlogists began to speculate that somebody must have wanted Mack dead, apparently because he knew too much about flying saucers. Within a day of Mack's death, a note was widely circulated on the Internet from somebody purporting to be \"British Higher Intelligence Agent X.\" X says, \"There's something circumstan\u00ad tially very odd here. Why was Mack alone in a deserted area almost totally unknown to him? For a planned hit, die Totteridge area of Mack's travels from his London dinner would be the perfect time and place. Car accident? You would have to try very hard to get hit by a car at night in this area. It is almost totally deserted at night, being right by three of the biggest reservoirs in Britain. The vast waters would have been a per\u00ad fect entrance and exit route for a hit team in silent electric dinghies.\" The San Francisco Bohemian physicist Jack Sarfatti commented, \"As Agent X says: What was John Mack doing alone late at night in such a god-forsaken place? I have recently returned from Britain myself and I would never have been Robert Sheaffer's World Wide Web page fir UFOs and other skeptical subjects is at unuw. debunker. com. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 17 alone in such a place late at night. Something stinks here.\" Now all that remains to be explained is why anyone would want to assemble a hit team to attack an eccentric old professor whose pronouncements about UFOs had got\u00ad ten so bizarre that practically nobody took him seriously any longer. Similar conspiracy claims surround the May 14, 2004, death of Eugene Mallove, the editor of Infinite Energy magazine, a major promoter of claims about \"cold fusion.\" Mallove, who had been overjoyed to hear in April that the U.S. Department of Energy had agreed to give \"cold fusion\" yet another review, was badly beaten while cleaning up a vacated rental house in Norwich, Connecticut, owned by his mother (see News & Comment, Sept./Oct. 2004). Police believe that robbery was the motive. His vehicle was stolen but recovered nearby, and investigators believe that his death may be related to two other murders in the area (see www.wfsb.com/Global/story. asp?S=2092115). Police suspect that his killer may have been Jarion Childs, a for\u00ad mer college basketball star who was killed while attempting to rob a Dairy Queen in Connecticut on June 28. Childs was shot while reportedly beating the owner of that establishment with a crowbar. However, many conspiracy theorists insist that Mallove was killed because he knew too much about \"cold fusion\" (see, for exam\u00ad ple, www.greatdreams.com/mallove.htm and www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/ thread50762/pgl). Norwich police Lt. Timothy Menard was quoted in The Boston Herald on May 18: \"There are tons of people calling saying he may have been on the verge of a great discovery. We don't feel (a conspiracy is) the case at this point.\" However, Menard added that \"We haven't ruled out any possibility.\" Paranormal monsters continue to men\u00ad ace South America. In my last column (November/December 2004, page 20), I wrote about the \"winged dogs\" and fly\u00ad ing \"dog-faced kangaroos\" that have been troubling certain residents of Chile. Now in Argentina, several employees of a fish hatchery have reported, according to the Diario El Tribuno (Salta, Argentina) 18 January/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUI on September 22, a \"large serpent with a hairy head and reddish eyes\" that report\u00ad edly emerged at night from a brick shack. \"We were baking bread when my wife saw the head of this veritable monster emerging from between the holes in the wall of a brick shack,\" said Jose Venticola. \"I was paralyzed. It had a snake's head, but hairy, with red eyes and a piercing gaze.\" They called out firefighters to hunt the creature, but like all paranormal monsters it was never found (see www.virtuallystrange.net/ufo/updates/20 04/sep/m23-027.shtml). But some solid paranormal evidence may at last be forthcoming. UFO Magazine in Brazil reports that a \"Skeleton in Brazilian museum might be of an alien being\" (see www.virtually strange.net/ufo/updates/2004/oct/m06- 0l7.shtml). At the privately owned Wilson Estevanovic Museum of Natural History in the city of Uberaba, which had its origin in a collection of artifacts exhibited in nineteenth-century cir\u00ad cuses, a bizarre-looking skeleton is said to be giving visitors the willies. It is apparently an embalmed skeleton that had been in the family's possession for ninety-six years. The Estevanovic family does not know where the piece comes from or how it was embalmed, but they believe it is more than 200 years old. The creature has an extremely large head for its size. One doctor said that the car\u00ad cass \"seems to have belonged to a her\u00ad maphrodite with six-fingered feet. . . this being had multiple anomalies. The most evident ones are the presence of hydrocephaly and palate-labial fissure.\" However, many people who have seen the being are convinced that it is an extraterrestrial creature. Veruska Este\u00ad vanovic, a biology student at the Uni\u00ad versity of Bahia and the granddaughter of the museum's founder, concluded after her own investigation that the skeleton probably belongs to an extraterrestrial. A.J. Gevaerd, the editor of UFO Magazine of Brazil and the founder of the Brazilian Center for Flying Saucer Research, says that he is assembling a team to study the creature, with the full cooperation of the museum owners. RER Another \"classic\" UFO photo has joined the ranks of admitted hoaxes\u2014at least for a few weeks, anyway. On February 15, 1954, a thirteen-year-old British schoolboy named Stephen Darbishire and his eight-year-old cousin Adrian Meyer were out strolling in the hills near Coniston, in the Lake District, when they used an \"old- fashioned\" Kodak box camera to snap two photos of an alleged \"flying saucer\" that had supposedly landed nearby. The photos, which closely resembled those published by the California UFO contactee George Adamski, quickly became a national media sensation. It was said to be the first photo of a flying saucer taken in Britain. The object in the photos looks implausible in the extreme: flat, silvery, and out-of-focus. Desmond Leslie, the British UFOlogist who was Adamski's colleague and co\u00ad author, quickly traveled to Coniston to interview the boys at length. Leslie noted that the boys kept a consistent story when interviewed by four hard\u00ad ened journalists from the BBC, and he cited their story and photos as strong confirming evidence of Adamski's tales. Leonard G. Cramp, an aeronautical engineer, wrote a bizarre 1955 book titled Space, Gravity, & The Flying Saucer in which he used a system called \"orthographic projection\" to prove that the object depicted in the Darbishire and Adamski photographs were propor\u00ad tionally identical. When Stephen and his father were visiting London in March 1954, they were quietly escorted to Buckingham Palace to meet with one of Prince Philip's private secretaries. The London Sunday Dispatch got wind of this meeting and reported (March 24, 1954) that the queen's husband had invited their visit because he wanted to know more about the saucer incident. For an example of UFOIogists who take the discussed in NICAP's classic 1964 \"UFO Evidence\" by Richard Hall, but Hall does not reach a firm conclusion about whether the photos are genuine or not. Over the years, Darbishire has alternately stuck to his story, then pro\u00ad claimed it a hoax, and later claimed that the \"hoax\" was itself a hoax. Darbishire, now a sixty-three-year-old artist and retired teacher, admitted in an interview published September 10 that the saucer photos were a \"schoolboy prank,\" saying that when confronted by the national media, he was \"too terrified\" to confess, and so he continued the deception. Another local artist, Julian Claxton, recently re-created the photos to show how the hoax had been done, for the sake of \"art\" (see www.nwemail.co.uk/ news/viewarticle.aspx?id= 143262). He used a fishing pole, a wooden frame, and a silvery UFO-shaped object. However, by the time that Claxton was ready with his extraterrestrial perfor\u00ad mance art on October 8, Darbishire had changed his story yet again, now claim\u00ad ing that the photo had \"definitely\" not been faked (see www.thisisthelakedis- trict.co.uk/news/lakes/display.var.53427 2.0.coniston_old_man_to_host_artist_ and_ufo.php). Some deep-thinking UFOIogists not to accept Darbishire's on-again, off- again confessions of a hoax, as if the photos themselves were not implausible enough, and as if a witness who keeps changing his story should be believed when he makes any extraordinary claim. Some suggest that Darbishire's UFO encounter and photos may somehow be too deep and profound for simplis\u00ad tic words like \"true\" or \"false\" (see, for example, www.flyingsaucery.com/ brigantia/brigmain.htm).

Skeptical Inquirer CSICOP SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 19 THINKING ABOUT SCIENCE MASSIMO PIGLIUCCI Piltdown and How Science Really Works w hen one debates cre\u00ad ationists (admit\u00ad tedly a question\u00ad able, yet often very satisfying, habit), one is bound to run up against the infamous Piltdown forgery. This is the case of an alleged missing link between humans and so-called lower primates, that was found in England (near Piltdown, in fact) and announced to the world on December 18, 1912. The announce\u00ad ment was made by Arthur Smith Woodward, a pale\u00ad ontologist of the British Museum of Natural History, and Charles Dawson, a local amateur paleontologist, the actual discoverer of the fossils. The problem is\u2014as creationists never tire to point out\u2014that the \"Dawn Man of Piltdown\" (scientific name Eoanthropus dawsoni, in honor of its dis\u00ad coverer) turned out to be a fake. Moreover, it took scientists four decades to find out! See what happens when one takes the doctrine of evolution on faith, Massimo Pigliucci is a professor of evolu\u00ad tionary biology at SUNY--Stony Brook, and the author of Denying Evolution: Creationism, Scientism and die Nature of Science. His essays can be found at www. rationallyspeaking. org. as one's secular religion? QED. Many scientists are rather embar\u00ad rassed by die Piltdown debacle, some\u00ad how managing to feel guilty and indi\u00ad rectly responsible for whatever goes wrong in their chosen profession. And yet, as I shall endeavor to explain, Piltdown should be presented in all introductory biology textbooks as a perfect example of how science actually works! Let us briefly see how die hoax unfolded. A complete and engaging ver\u00adsion of the story can be found in the 1955 classic, The Piltdown Forgery by J.S. Weiner (one of the scientists who eventually uncovered the truth), recently re-issued by Oxford University Press with a new introduction and afterword. Before Piltdown, very little of the human fossil record was known. When Darwin wrote The Descent of Man, he had to rely largely on comparative data from other living species of pri\u00ad mates, for only the clearly almost-human Neanderthals were known to paleon\u00ad tologists. A few years before Piltdown, however, two impor\u00ad tant discoveries were made: that of Java man in 1891 and Heidelberg man in 1907, neither of which were very ancient. When a significantly older set of prehuman remains was allegedly found at Piltdown, the scientific world was simply ready for the discovery. It was what practitioners in die field had expected, something that surely the perpetrator of the hoax knew very well. Supposed evidence of Piltdown man was found on more than one occasion at two separate sites: fragments of skulls, of a lower jaw, and even of stone tools asso\u00ad ciated with the \"culture\" of these predawn men. While there were skeptics from die beginning, die hoax was simply 20 January/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER too elaborate and cunningly put togedier to raise the suspicion of a significant number of paleontologists. National pride probably also played a role in a professional establishment that at the time was dominated by British scientists, with the British Museum being the epi\u00ad center of all the activities surrounding the study of die Piltdown fossils. Yet suspicions about die authenticity of Eoanthropus dawsoni grew, until a group of researchers, including Wilfrid Le Gros Clark, Kenneth Oakley, and Joe Weiner, applied stringent chemical tests to the remains, demonstrating that the \"fossils\" had been planted and chemi\u00ad cally altered to make diem seem appro\u00ad priately ancient: the Dawn Man was nothing but a perfectly ordinary human skull paired up with a somewhat unusu\u00ad ally small jaw from an orangutan. What Weiner and colleagues couldn't say for sure was who carried out the hoax, although a strong case was then made by Weiner in his 1955 book that the perpe\u00ad trator was none other than Dawson himself. [See also review of Miles Russell, Piltdown Man, on p. 50.] MYSTERY PAINTING: THE SHADOW OF THE CROSS' Continued from page 16 Conclusions Evidence suggests that despite his reported protestations to the contrary, artist Henri Ault deliberately and clev\u00ad erly created \"The Shadow of die Cross\" effects. Just such a metamorphosing pic\u00ad ture could have been accomplished using glow-in-the-dark pigments or paints that were well known and even commercially available at the time the painting was produced. It is no longer much of a mys\u00ad tery and certainly no miracle, notwith\u00ad standing die disingenuity with which the painting's custodians claim science is baf\u00ad fled while at the same time avoiding die testing diat could lay die matter to rest. Acknowledgments In addition to Vaughn Rees and John Robert Colombo, I received research assistance from Timothy Binga and Benjamin Radford. Philip Befumo, Jr., Product Manager of United Mineral & Chemical Corporation Be diat as it may, what does this story tell us about how science works? Well, on the negative side, it is painfully clear that science depends on an assumption of honesty on the pan of its practition\u00ad ers. Peer review is focused on uncovering methodological or reasoning errors, not possible frauds. But since science is, after all, a human activity, egos, money, and the search for glory\u2014however brief\u2014are still to be reckoned with. As Piltdown and other forgeries have shown, scien\u00ad tists are continuously open to the possi\u00ad bility of someone fooling them by not playing by the rules of the game. On the other hand, science is a social activity unlike any other that human beings engage in: it is a game of discov\u00ad ery played against a powerful but neu\u00ad tral opponent, nature itself. And nature cannot be fooled, at least not for long. The reason suspicions kept mounting about the true origin of die Piltdown remains was that the more paleontolo\u00ad gists uncovered about human evolution, die less Dawn Man seem to fit with the rest of die puzzle. In a sense, the very factor that made the acceptance of (Lyndhurst, N.J.), generously provided a phosphorescent pigment for my experi\u00ad ments. I am also grateful to Paul Loynes for word processing and Lisa Hutter for photo\u00ad graphic assistance. Notes 1. Vaughn Rees used a hand-held ultraviolet lamp (both short-wave and long-wave) to examine the area around the cross but die UV showed nothing remarkable. 2. One source claims that any known lumi\u00ad nous paint should have ceased to be phosphores\u00ad cent by now due to oxidation (Shadow n.d.). Be that as it may. paintings arc often given a protec\u00ad tive coat of varnish (Laurie 1967, 169-171) which can improve die longevity and brightness of lumi\u00ad nous paints (Phosphorescent 2003).

Eoanthropus dawsoni so fast in the beginning\u2014because it seemed to be the much sought-after \"missing link\" in human evolution\u2014was also the reason why, four decades later, scientists kept pursuing the possibility that it was not genuine after all. While four decades of delay may seem an inordinate amount of time, they are but the blink of an eye when compared to the history of the human quest for knowledge. Moreover, it is important to note that it was scien\u00ad tists who uncovered the hoax, not cre\u00ad ationists, which is both an immense credit to the self-correcting nature of sci\u00ad ence and yet another indication that cre- ationism is only a religious doctrine with no power of discovery. This is, then, why Piltdown\u2014far from being an embarrassment\u2014should be prominently featured in biology text\u00ad books: it is an example of how the nature of science is not that of a steady, linear march toward the Truth but rather of a tortuous road, often characterized by dead ends and U-turns, yet ultimately progressing toward a better, if tentative, understanding of the natural world. com/apparitions.html; accessed August 10, 2004.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 21 NOTES ON A STRANGE WORLD MASSIMO POLIDORO Facts and Fiction in the Kennedy Assassination November cade. Cred Investigating historical mys\u00ad teries is, possibly, one die most fascinating and rewarding aspects of die work of a skeptical researcher. Mysteries diat appear to have no possible solutions, that could certainly be termed \"cold,\" can, some\u00ad times, become clearer thanks to a more careful investigation of die original sources and also to die advancements of science. Think only of die many histori\u00ad cal enigmas and crimes that DNA-testing techniques have helped to solve, like the riddle of Anastasia Romanoff's claimed survival (Gill 1994, 1995) or the real origins of Kaspar Hauser (Weichhold 1998). However, cases are often made more difficult to solve when facts get confused with imagined realities and unfounded conclusions. Eyewitness testimonies and self-styled experts, even in good faith, can alter details and hide important clues diat\u2014if untouched\u2014could lead to radically different conclusions. In order to give you some clear examples of what I mean, I will examine one of the great tragedies of die twentieth century. The Day JFK Died Hundreds of books and thousands of articles have been written about die Massimo Polidoro is an investigator of the paranormal, author, lecturer, and cofounder and head of CICAP, the Italian skeptics group. His Web site is www.massimo polidoro.com. 1963, John F. Kennedy and Jackie in the presidential motor- t: 1963 Art Rickerby/Black Star tragic death of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, and it would take a few com\u00ad plete issues of SKEPTICAL INQUIRER just to deal with the more relevant matters involved in the case. I will outline sev\u00ad eral examples of bad research involved in popular investigations of this case. Let's get back to that fatal day, November 22, 1963. President Kennedy arrived in Dallas, Texas, during the elec\u00ad tion campaign. In 1964, there would have been new elections, and Kennedy, who wanted to be sure to be re-elected, had started a tour of the southern states, the most conservative ones, where he was less popular due to his progres\u00ad sive ideas. It was decided that a motorcade would be conducted through the city. Kennedy and his wife would be in the backseat of the presidential limousine, and Governor Connally and his wife would sit in front of them. Dealey Plaza, in downtown Dallas, is a large, basin-like square where three roads converge toward an underpass that leads to j-^| a freeway. The Presidential lim\u00ad ousine entered the plaza, moved slowly along Houston Street, then took a left turn right in front of die Texas School Book Depository building. It was diirty minutes past noon. What happened next was documented by a movie buff, Abraham Zapruder, who was fuming die motorcade with an 8 mm movie camera. The film is silent, for diere was no audio on home-movie cameras back dien. During the shocking sequence, the President can be seen waving to die crowd, but then he is hit by something and brings his hands to his neck, right in front of him. Governor Connally starts to turn and shake, he is hit as well. Then, there is a fatal shot to Kennedy's head. He died soon after at die hospital. Who killed him? It was soon deter\u00ad mined that the shots came from the sixth floor of the Book Depository. There, piles of boxes were found, stashed around a window, creating a \"sniper's nest\" with a clear view of the site of the shooting. A rifle was also found that had just been fired along with three spent cartridge shells. After about two hours, a suspect was stopped. He had had a confrontation with the police inside a movie theater, and it was later found out that he had just shot dead a policeman who had stopped him on a nearby street. His name was Lee Harvey Oswald; he was a young man who worked at die depository and had been seen on die sixth floor of that building just minutes 22 January/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Figure 1.

Oswald was an ex-marine and com\u00ad munist sympathizer. The evidence against him quickly piled up, but only three days after his capture, during his transfer to a police van that would escort him to a more secure prison, nightclub owner Jack Ruby shot him dead. Those of you who have seen the Oliver Stone movie JFK, where this story is told in great detail, will remem\u00ad ber die many contradictions coming out of die official investigation of the assas\u00ad sination. I have seen that movie as well, and, like anyone else, I couldn't help but be convinced that Oswald could not be the only assassin. There had to be more than one killer, and this meant that there had been a conspiracy plot to kill the president. At least, I believed that until I started to research the story for my latest book (Polidoro 2004), and the strangest thing to me was that the deeper 1 went into it, the more the Oliver Stone version of the story looked weirder and weirder. I can't go into the coundess details here, as I have done in the book, but I'll give you just a couple of examples of the kind of pitfalls into which a historical investigator can easily fall. I Saw It; I Was There ... Most strange phenomena and conspir\u00ad acy theories rely on eyewitness testi\u00ad mony. Psychologists are aware of the many limits of memory and percep\u00adtion\u2014and the fallibility of eyewitness accounts (Loftus 1980, 1996). One of the best-known witnesses to the assassination, and the only one who is also the author of a book from the point of view of an eyewitness, was a woman named Jean Hill (Sloan and Hill 1992). She can be seen in the Zapruder film, standing beside a friend. In her testimony, told and retold over the last forty years, she claimed among other things that she was looking at the limousine where she saw Kennedy and his wife, Jackie; the couple was \"looking at a little dog between them,\" a \"white fluffy dog.\" Hill then jumped to the edge of the street to yell, \"Hey, we want to take your picture!\" JFK turned over to look at her. At that point, he was shot, and Jackie shouted, \"My God, he has been shot!\" Then, Mrs. Hill said that she saw \"some men in plain clothes shooting back\" and \"a man with a hat running toward the mon\u00ad ument\" on die other side of the plaza on the so-called \"grassy knoll.\" Immediately, she started running after him, thinking he was involved in die shooting. \"When I ran across the street,\" she specified, \"die first motorcycle that was right behind the President's car nearly hit me.\" Thus, she was the first person to run up the grassy knoll, and many followed her. However, the man ran off and she missed him. She was convinced that this man was Jack Ruby, the club owner who, in three days, would kill Lee Harvey Oswald. And there we have our proof for the existence of a conspiracy. This, however, is one of those rare occasions in which dozens of reporters and photographers are present on the scene of an event and so there are count\u00ad less statements on record from eyewit\u00ad nesses and pictures from every angle. Thus, we can compare Jean Hill's mem\u00ad ory with actual facts. She said that she was looking at the limousine. In the film, you can see that when Kennedy is shot the first time, she is looking away from him. She said that the couple was \"look\u00ad ing at a little dog between them,\" a \"white fluffy dog.\" There was no dog between them, just a bunch of red flowers. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 23 She said that she \"jumped to the edge of the street\" to yell, \"Hey, we want to take your picture!\" and JFK turned over to look at her. The Zapruder film shows that Hill never moved or said a word\u2014and the President did not turn to look over. In fact, he had just been shot when he passed in front of her. She said that Jackie shouted, \"My God, he has been shot!\" Jackie and the car's four other wit\u00ad nesses deny that Jackie said anything. She said that she saw \"some men in plain clothes shooting back.\" But in an interview recorded just forty minutes after the assassination by a Dallas television station, she was asked: \"Did you sec the person who fired the\u2014\" And she answered: \"No ... I didn't see any person fire the weapon ... I only heard it.\" She said that she immediately started running after the \"man with a hat,\" thinking he was involved in the shooting. \"When I ran across the street,\" she specified, \"the first motorcycle that was right behind the President's car nearly hit me.\" But as can be seen in the many pictures taken during those fatal moments, she stands still at her place as the limousine and the motorbikes pass by. She even sits on the grass while all of the cars of the motorcade proceed behind the President's limousine. She also specified that after jumping into the middle of the road, she was the first person to run up the grassy knoll, and many followed her. In photographs, you can see a lot of people running around die area and up to the grassy knoll, but Hill always stays in the same spot, probably shocked by the whole thing, like most of die people present. She was convinced diat the man she had followed was Jack Ruby. At that precise moment, Ruby was witnessed by many to be at the offices of die Dallas Morning News. Now, as we can see, facts contradict many details of Jean Hill's dramatic tes\u00ad timony. Aside from excusable mistakes and errors made in good faith, we have here a story that, over the years, has changed and grown out of proportion, to the point that Mrs. Hill became a sort of celebrity, invited to every meet\u00ading of JFK buffs, and was even depicted in Oliver Stone's movie. She is the proud holder of a card bragging that she was the \"closest witness\" to the President at the time of the fatal shot to the head. It is quite clear what happens to some people when they find them\u00ad selves right in the middle of history and have absolutely no role in it. They imagine one. This Must Be So; I Know... Imagined testimonies are just one of the many problems diat an investigator of historical mysteries has to deal with. Another one is \"imagined experts,\" that is, self-styled experts with no real exper\u00ad tise in the chosen field except what they think is \"common sense.\" The Kennedy assassination presents dozens of such cases, but one of the most popular involves the so-called \"magic bullet.\" The Warren Commission that inves\u00ad tigated the Kennedy assassination con\u00ad cluded that the reactions of Kennedy and Connally occurred too close together for two separate shots, even from the same gun, to have been respon\u00ad sible for their wounds. They almost seem to react at the same instant, in the enhanced version of the film seen by the commission. They concluded that one, single bullet caused the injuries to both the President and the Governor. This is where the \"imagined experts\" step in and say: \"It must have been a really magical bullet in order to enter Kennedy from the back, exit from his throat, dien make a turn and enter Connallys back, exit from his chest, hit is right wrist, make another bend, and, finally, land in his left thigh!\" How could a single bullet follow this zigzag route, seen in figure 1? Their conclusion is obvious: those injuries could not have been produced by just one bullet, so there had to be more than one shooter\u2014further proof of a conspiracy. This conclusion, however, as logical as it may sound at first, does not take real facts into account. And it only works until you don't look at Kennedys and Connallys actual positions in the car. They were not one in front of the other; Kennedy was in a higher position in the back seat, and Connally was sit\u00ad ting lower, in the middle of the front seat of the car. So, in order to produce those injuries, the path shown in figure 2 is the real trajectory that a bullet had to follow, and, from die analysis per\u00ad formed by real experts, it turns out that thete was only one position from which this bullet could be shot: the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. What can we conclude from these examples? Certainly, that investigators must guard against preconceived ideas before starting an investigation. Before you know it, you start twisting facts and discarding evidence that contradict those ideas, making you draw un\u00ad founded solutions. What we should do instead is to try to do our best to dig up facts and let them speak for themselves. They may have things to say that often turn out to be quite surprising.

D 24 lanuary/february 200S SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Critical Thinking About Energy The Case for Decentralized Generation of Electricity Highly centralized generation of electrical power is a paradigm that has outlived its usefulness. Decentralized generation could save $5 trillion in capital investment, reduce power costs by 40 percent, reduce vulnerabilities, and cut greenhouse gas emissions in half. THOMAS R. CASTEN and BRENNAN DOWNES Electricity was originally generated at remote hydro\u00ad electric dams or by burning coal in the city centers, delivering electricity to nearby buildings and recy\u00ad cling the waste heat to make steam to heat the same build\u00ad ings. Rural houses had no access to power. Over time, coal plants grew in size, facing pressure to locate far from popu\u00ad lation because of their pollution. Transmission wires carried the electricity many miles to users with a 10 to 15 percent loss, a difficult but tolerable situation. Because it is not prac\u00ad tical to transmit waste heat over long distances, the heat was vented. There was no good technology available for clean, local generation, so the wasted heat was a tradeoff for cleaner air in the cities. Eventually a huge grid was developed and SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Janujry/Febrjary 2005 25 8,000 the power industry built all-new generation in remote areas, far from users. All plants were specially designed and built on site, creating economies of scale. It cost less per unit of gener\u00ad ation to build large plants than to build smaller plants. These conditions prevailed from 1910 through 1960, and everyone in the power industry and government came to assume that remote, central generation was optimal, that it would deliver power at die lowest cost versus other alternatives. However, technology has improved and natural gas distrib\u00ad ution now blankets the country. By 1970, mass-produced engines and turbines cost less per unit of capacity than large plants, and the emissions have been steadily reduced. These smaller engines and gas turbines are good neighbors, and can be located next to users in the middle of population centers. Furthermore, the previously wasted heat can be recycled from these decentralized generation plants to displace boiler fuel and essentially cut the fuel for electric generation in half, com\u00ad pared to remote or central generation of the same power. But the industry had ossified. Electric monopolies were allowed to charge rates to give a fair return on cap\u00ad ital employed. To prevent excessive or monopoly profits, the utilities have long been required to pass 100 percent of any gain in efficiency to the users. This leaves utilities with no financial incen\u00ad tive to adopt new technologies and build decentralized generation that recycles heat. In fact, such local generation erodes the rationale for continued monopoly protection\u2014if one can make cheap power at every factory or high rise apartment house, why should society limit competition? Congress tried to open competition a little bit in 1978, and some independent power companies began to develop on- site generation wherever they could find ways around the monopoly regulation. One author (Casten) was one of those early pioneers, working to develop more efficient decentralized generation since 1975. This article summarizes extensive research into the economically optimal way to build new power generation in each of die past 30 years, given then available technology, capital costs, and fuel Thomas R.

The result is a skeptical look at the worlds largest industry\u2014 the electric power industry\u2014with surprising conclusions. Power industry regulations largely derive from the unques\u00ad tioned belief that central generation is optimal. However we believe the conventional \"central generation paradigm\" is based on last century's technology. Meeting the world's grow\u00ad ing appetite for electric power widi conventional central gen\u00ad eration will severely tax capital markets, fossil fuel markets, and the global environment. The International Energy Agency's (IEA) 2002 World Energy Outlook Reference Case\u2014based on present policies\u2014presents a frightening view of the next thirty years.1 The Reference Case says world energy demand will grow by two-thirds, with fossil fuels meeting 90 percent of the increase. World electrical demand doubles, requiring construction of nearly 5,000 gigawatts of new gen\u00ad erating capacity, equivalent to adding sue times current United 2010 | Existing Capacity 2020 New Capacity 2030 Figure 1. World installed electricity generation capacity. States electric generating capacity. The generation alone will cost $4.2 trillion, plus transmission and distribution (T&D) costs of $6.6 trillion (2004 U.S. dollars). Under this projec\u00ad tion, global carbon dioxide emissions increase by 70 percent; see figure 1. The Reference Case assumes that the energy policies of each government in 2002 continue without change, a modest evolu\u00ad tion of technology, and continued reliance on central generation of electric power, which is consistent with most existing policies and regulations. The IEA projections assume that central gener\u00ad ation is the optimal approach, given today's technology. The IEA report is silent on the need for (or capital cost of) new T&D, even though existing T&D is far from adequate. There were 105 reported grid failures in the U.S. between 2000 and 2003, and eleven of those outages affected more 26 January/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER than a half million people.1 U.S. consumers paid $272 billion for electricity in 2003,' plus power outage costs, estimated between S80 billion and $123 billion per year. Outages thus add 29 percent to 45 percent to the cost of U.S. power.' The T&D situation is worse in developing countries, where 1.6 billion people lack any access to electric power and many oth\u00ad ers are limited to a few hours of service per day. Satisfying expected load growth with central generation will clearly require at least comparable construction of T&D capacity. Close examination of past power industry options and choices suggests that load growth can be met with just over half the fossil fuel and pollution associated with conventional central generation. We had better get this world energy expansion right. Consider these points: The power industry has not deployed optimal technology over the past thirty years. The universally accepted \"Central Generation Paradigm\" prevents optimal energy decisions. Decentralized generation (DG), using the same technologies used by remote central generation, significantly improves every key outcome from power generation. Meeting global load growth with decentralized energy can save $5 trillion of capital, lower the cost of incremental power by 35-40 per\u00ad cent, and reduce CO: emissions by 50 percent versus the IEA central genera\u00ad tion dominated reference case. progress after World War II drove electric-only efficiencies to 33 percent (after distribution losses) and increased individual plant size to between 500 and 1,000 megawatts. Central or remote generation of electricity only, while still wasting two- thirds of the input energy, became the standard. Buttressed by monopoly protection, utilities fought competing on-site gen\u00ad eration and, by 1970, replaced all but 3 to 4 percent of local generation, ending waste heat recycling. Government regula\u00ad tions, developed over the first 90 years of commercial electric\u00ad ity, institutionalized central generation. The third wave of technical progress should have reversed the central generation trend. Modern power plants emit only 1 to 2 percent as much nitrogen oxides as 1970 plants, come in all sizes, burn all fuels, and are good neighbors. Many technical advances make local or distributed generation technically and economically feasible and enable society to return to energy recycling, displacing boiler fuel and doubling net electric effi\u00ad ciency. However, protected from competition and rewarded by obsolete rules, the power industry continues to build remote plants and ignores opportunities to recycle energy. The squares in figure 2 represent the alternative to central or remote generation. These are actual plants employing cen- A Brief History of Electric 2 shows that United States net electric efficiency peaked in about 1910, when nearly all generation was located near users and recycled waste heat. That efficiency dropped to 33 percent over the next fifty years as die power industry moved to electric-only central genera\u00ad tion. Industry efficiency has not improved in four decades. Technology improved, enabling conversion of fuel to electricity to rise from 7 percent at com\u00ad mercial inception to 33 percent by 1960. The best electric-only technology now converts more than 50 percent of die fuel to power, but the industry's average efficiency has not improved in forty-three years. No other industry wastes two-thirds of its raw material; no other indus\u00ad try has stagnant efficiency; no other industry gets less produc\u00ad tivity per unit output in 2004 than it did in 1904. Early generating technology converted 7 percent to 20 per\u00ad cent of die fuel to electricity, making electric-only production quite expensive. To reduce fuel costs, energy entrepreneurs, including Thomas Edison, built generating plants near ther\u00ad mal users and recycled waste heat, increasing net electric effi\u00ad ciency to as much as 75 percent.

These combined heat and power (CHP) plants deploy die best modern electric-only technology and achieve 65 percent to 97 percent net electrical efficiency by recycling normally wasted heat and by avoiding transmission and distribution losses. United States Energy Information Agency (EIA) records show 931 distributed generation plants with 72,800 megawatts of capacity, about 8.1 percent of U.S. generation. These plants demonstrate die technical and economic feasibility of dou\u00ad bling U.S. electricity efficiency. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 27 Nevertheless, the U.S. and world power industry ignores\u2014 and indeed actively fights against\u2014distributed generation. Conventional central generation plants dump two-thirds of their energy into lakes, rivers, and cooling towers, while facto\u00ad ries and commercial facilities burn more fuel to produce the heat just thrown away. We believe the power industry has not made wise or efficient choices, and set out to test this thesis with data. A Flawed Worldwide Heat & Power System To determine whether the power industry made optimal choices, we analyzed EIA data on all 5,242 reported genera\u00ad tion plants, separating plants built by firms with monopoly- protected territories and plants built by independent power producers. We calculated what price per KWh would be required for each of four central genera\u00ad tion technologies, built in each year, to provide a fair return on capital/ We also analyzed distributed genera\u00ad tion (DG) technology choices. Several clarifications are necessary: focuses only on power companies' cost of capital. Figure 3 depicts our findings. The light grey line shows the average price of power to all U.S. consumers in each year. The dashed lines show the retail price per megawatt-hour needed to fully fund new plants using four power generation tech\u00ad nologies built as central stations, unable to recycle waste heat. (Note: Move the decimal one number left in price per megawatt-hour to equal cents per kilowatt-hour. For example, $65 per MWh is 6.5 cents per kWh.) The four highest solid lines show the retail prices per megawatt-hour needed to fully pay for power from the same technologies built near thermal users to recycle waste heat. The two lowest solid lines depict retail prices per MWh needed for power generated with recy\u00ad cled industrial process heat or flare gas, and power extracted from gas or steam pressure drop. 180 160 Average Re tail Central CCGT Cogen CCGT Recycled Energy (Thermal Recovery) ...

DG is not a new concept. Edison built his first commercial electric plant near Wall Street in lower Manhattan, and he recycled energy to heat surrounding buildings. DG plants employ all of the technolo\u00ad gies that are used in central generation. DG plant capacities range from a few kilowatts to several hundred mega\u00ad watts, depending on the users' needs. We have installed 40-kilowatt back\u00ad pressure steam turbines in office build\u00ad ings that recycle steam pressure drop, Figure 3. Long-term U.S and managed a 200-megawatt coal- fired CHP plant serving Kodak's world headquarters in Rochester, New York. DG can use renewable energy, but not every renewable energy plant is DG. Solar photovoltaic panels on individual buildings or local windmills are distributed generation, while large hydro and wind farms are central generation requiring transmission and distribution (T&D). DG uses all fuels, including nuclear. Modern naval vessels generate power with nuclear reactors and then recycle waste heat to displace boiler fuel. Power generated near users avoids the need for T&D. We have assumed each kilowatt of new DG will require net T&D investment equal to only 10 percent of a kilowatt, for backup services.'' We assume DG plants require a 50 percent higher average cost of capital (12 percent versus 8 percent) due to risks and transaction costs.

Thermal plants generate steam by burning fossil fuel in boil\u00ad ers. The steam then drives condensing steam turbines. Thermal generation technology matured in the mid-fifties, achieving maximum electric-only efficiency of 38 percent to 40 percent, before line losses. Over the entire period, new central oil and gas thermal plants (top dashed line) required prices well above average retail. Gas turbines use a different cycle; the technology improved dramatically over the period. Simple cycle gas turbine plants (dashed line) required similar prices to gas-fired thermal plants until 1985-90, when improving turbine efficiency reduced fuel and lowered required prices. New coal plants (dashed black line) could sell power for below average retail prices each year until 1998. However, environmental rules blocked coal plants in many states. Combined cycle gas turbine plants (CCGTs) are the same gas turbines described above, but the plants also make steam with the turbine exhaust to drive a second power generation cycle\u2014a condensing steam turbine. The first commercial 28 January/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER applications of CCGTs were in 1974. These plants cost less to build than an oil and gas thermal plant and initially achieved 40 percent efficiency, which rose to 55 percent by 1995. 10.000 ,111111 I I I I & GM Hydro I Pumped Storage CCGT SCGT Other Other DG I 50.000 \u00ab mo Figure 4.

Distributed Generation Recycles Energy to Reduce Costs The solid lines show retail prices required for distributed generation or DG\u2014building the same technologies near thermal users and recycling nor\u00ad mally wasted heat. The solid lines demonstrate the economic value of recy\u00ad cling energy. Burning coal in combined heat and power plants (solid black line) saves $ 11 to $27 per MWh versus burn\u00ad ing coal in new central plants. Simple cycle gas turbine plants built near users (solid line) save $25 to $60 per MWh versus the same technology producing only electricity. Building combined cycle gas turbine plants near users and recycling waste heat saves even more money, reducing required costs by $25 per MWh versus the same technology built remote from users. The lowest-cost power avoids burn\u00ad ing any extra fossil fuel by recycling waste energy from process industries. Process industries use fossil fuel or elec\u00ad tricity to transform raw materials and then discard energy in three forms including hot exhaust gas, flare gas, and pressure drop. Local \"bottoming cycle\" generation can recycle this waste into heat and/or power. The two lowest solid lines show the retail price per megawatt-hour needed for power recycled from waste heat, flare gas, and gas or steam pressure drop after credit for displacing boiler fuel with the recovered heat. These energy-recycling plants can earn fair returns on capital selling retail power at only 25 to 50 percent of average retail prices. Power Industry Choices for New Capacity An ideal approach would build all possi\u00ad ble plants requiring the lowest retail price per megawatt-hour first and then build plants with the next lowest needed retail price, etc. To determine whether the electric power industry made optimal choices, we analyzed all power plants built since 1973. The new generation built in each two- year period by monopolies, which we defined as any utility with a protected dis\u00ad tribution territory, is seen in figure 4. Monopoly utilities include investor- owned utilities, cooperatives, municipal utilities, and state and federally owned utilities. They collectively built 435,000 megawatts of new generation, but ignored energy recycling, even though it was always the cheapest option.

Monopoly utilities were slow to make optimal choices among central plant technologies and completely ignored the more cost-effective distributed use of the same technologies. Figure 5 shows the 175,000 MW of new generation built by independent power producers (IPP's) since 1973. Most new SKEPTICAL INQUIRER lanuary/February 2005 29 ' Figure 6. Total generation capacity built by U.S. electric utilities, 1973-2002. IPP plants were distributed generation and/or combined cycle plants until the last four years. The price spikes of 1998-2000 apparently induced IPP companies to install simple cycle gas turbines for peaking. Prior to 1978 passage of the Public Utility Policy Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA) it was illegal to build generation as a third party. Between 1978 and the law change in 1992, IPPs were allowed to build qualifying facili\u00ad ties\u2014those that recycled at least 10 percent of the fuel's energy for heat use, or utilized certain waste fuels. After 1992, IPPs could legally build remote electric-only generation plants. For another view of industry choices, we divided plants built since 1973 into those recycling and not recycling energy. Generating plants that recycle energy must be near thermal users or near sources of industrial waste energy. Figure 6 shows that only 1.2 percent or 5,000 of the 435,000 megawatts of new generation built by monopolies over the thirty-year period recycled energy. We doubt that these choices would be profitable in a competitive marketplace. Independent power producers built 34 percent of their total capacity as DG plants, at or near users. Figure 7 depicts the mix of central and distributed power built by IPPs since 1978. Finally, we estimated the potential generation from the least-cost options\u2014those plants that recycle industrial process waste energy. EPA aerometric data and other industry analyses suggest that U.S. industrial waste energy would power 40,000 to 100,000 megawatts with no incremental fossil fuel and no incremental pollution.\" However, EIA plant data show only 2,200 megawatts of recycled industrial energy capacity, 2.2 percent to 5 percent of the potential.\" It seems clear that the power industry has made poor choices that have increased cost and decreased efficiency. These data show that utilities eschewed least-cost generating technologies, effectively increasing prices to all customers. Meeting Expected U.S. Load Growth with Local Generation Our colleagues built a model to determine the best way to sat\u00ad isfy projected load growth for any nation over the next two decades.9 The model incorporates relevant factors for central and distributed electric generation technologies, including projected improvements in cost, efficiency, and availability of each technology. The model assumes new central generation will require 100 percent new transmission and distribution and new decentralized generation will require new T&D equal to 10 percent of added generating capacity. The model assumes 9 percent line losses for central power, equal to U.S. losses for 2002, and 2 percent net line losses for DG power. Although the future surely includes some mix of central and decentralized generation, the model calculates the extreme cases of meeting all load growth with central generation, or meeting all growth with decentralized generation. Local generation that recycles energy improves every important outcome versus full reliance on central generation. Figure 8 compares the extreme cases. Full reliance on DG for expected U.S. load growth would avoid $326 billion in capital by 2020, reduce incremental power costs by $53 billion, NO, by 58 percent, and SO, by 94 percent. Full DG lowers carbon dioxide emissions by 49 per\u00ad cent versus total reliance on new central generation.

Detailed analysis by others will undoubt\u00ad edly refine the estimates, and there will be some mix of central and decentralized generation. The analysis shows the extreme cases to provide guidance. Figure 9 shows expected world load growth with conventional central plants that convert 100 units of fuel into 67 units of wasted energy and 33 units of delivered power. The text at the bottom reflects IEA's projected capital cost for 4,800 gigawatts of new generation, total\u00ad ing $4.2 trillion. The International Energy Agency was silent on T&D, so we used estimates made for the United States Department of Energy on the all-in cost per kW of new transmission to forecast $6.6 trillion cost for new wires and trans\u00ad formers. Assuming U.S. average line losses (which are significandy lower than developing country line losses), 9 percent of die capacity will be lost, leaving 4,368 gigawatts delivered to users. To achieve the IEA Reference Case with central gen\u00ad eration, the world must invest SI0.8 tril\u00ad lion capital, roughly $2,500 per kW of delivered capacity. Meeting IEA Reference Case load growth with decentralized generation will lower the need for redundant generauon. An analysis by the Carnegie Mellon Electric Industry Center suggests building only 78 percent of die 4,800 gigawatts as DG would provide equal or better reliabil\u00ad ity.10 However, in developing economies, reliability may not be die driver. To be conservative, we have ignored the poten\u00ad tial reduction in generation due to increased reliability inherent in larger numbers of smaller plants in the DG case. However, we did reduce required generation for die DG case to 4,368 GW, since there are no net line losses. Figure 10 depicts the process of meeting expected world load growth with distributed generation. We estimated average capital costs for decentralized generation of $1,200 per kW. $310 more capital cost than a kilowatt of new central genera\u00ad tion. Even with 9 percent less DG capacity, the capital costs for generation increase to $5.2 trillion, $1.0 trillion more than building central plants. Looking only at generation costs, DG is not competitive. However, the hill decentralized generation Pollution Transmission: $1,380/kW 4,368 GW $10.8 trillion Figure 9.

Combined heat and power flowchart. case requires only 430 GW of new T&D, costing $0.6 trillion, a $6 trillion savings on T&D. End users receive 4,638 GW in both cases, but society invests $5 trillion less for the DG case. Everyone knows that \"you get what you pay for.\" What does the world give up by selecting a $5 trillion cheaper approach to meet projected electric growth? We extrapolated U.S. analysis to the IEA Reference Case and found the world would give up the following by adopting the cheaper DG case: Consume 122 billion fewer barrels of oil equivalent (half of known Saudi oil reserves) SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 31 Lost fossil fuel sales of $2.8 trillion Lost medical revenues from air pollution-related illnesses Potentially lost savings if governments opt to supply electric services to entire population instead of leaving 1.4 billion people without electric access Less global warming due to 50 percent less CO, emissions. Recommended Actions If this analysis survives critical review, then what policy reforms will steer the power industry toward optimal deci\u00ad sions, given available technology? We offer two potential approaches, hoping to start the policy debate. Distributed generation of electricity saves the world $5 trillion in capital investment while reducing power costs by 40 percent and cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half. There are important implications for worldwide energy policy if this analysis is correct. Comprehensive Reform Governments guide the electric industry with many rules, mandates, and limitations that collectively block competition and innovation, thus causing excessive costs and fuel usage. Small regulatory changes may nudge the power industry to slight course corrections, but are unlikely to break the central generation paradigm and optimize generation. Immediately eliminating all current barriers to efficiency would cause the electric power industry to make better deci\u00ad sions. Each government could examine every rule that affects power generation and delivery and ask whether the social purpose behind that rule still exists. Then each state or coun\u00ad try could enact comprehensive legislation that we term the Energy Regulatory Reform and Tax Act (ERRATA), to cor\u00ad rect all of the mistakes in current law. ERRATA would dereg\u00ad ulate all electric generation and sales, modernize environ\u00ad mental regulations to induce efficiency, and change taxation to reward efficiency.\" Sadly, ERRATA legislation probably will not pass except in response to deepening environmental and economic pain. Actionable Reform. National Fossil Fuel Efficiency Standards A second possible approach simply rewards all fossil efficient power and penalizes fossil inefficient power. Each government could enact a Fossil Fuel Efficiency Standard covering all locally used electricity, regardless of origin. This standard does not favor fuels, technologies, or participants. Here are the essential elements: Give all delivered megawatt-hours an equal allowance of incremental fossil fuel, regardless of age of plant, technology or ownership. Start with the national aver\u00ad age fossil fuel per MWh for the prior year. Spread allowances over all generation of each owner, allowing owners to comply by increasing efficiency of existing plants, deploying new highly efficient plants, or purchasing fossil allowances from others. Reward plants requiring little or no fos\u00ad sil fuel, such as solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, and industrial waste energy recycling, by allowing them to sell fos\u00ad sil fuel credits.1' Penalize fossil inefficient plants by forcing them to purchase allowances for each MWh produced. Base allowances on delivered power to incorporate T&D losses from central generation. Credit displaced fuel to CHP plants that recycle heat. Force all generators to purchase ade\u00ad quate allowances or close their plants to ensure that the total allowance trad\u00ad ing is economically neutral. Reduce die fossil fuel allowances per MWh each year according to a schedule. Adjust the schedule downward each year to correct for growth in total power delivered, guaranteeing that the total fossil fuel use will drop. A Fossil Fuel Efficiency Standard would steer the power industry toward optimal choices. This will reduce power costs and emissions, which will improve local standard of living and improve the competitive position of local industry. Other states and nations will follow suit. Conclusion We have attempted to frame the consequences of meeting energy load growth with conventional central generation or deploying decentralized generation that recycles waste energy. The DG case saves the world S5 trillion in capital investment while reducing power costs by 40 percent and cutting green\u00ad house gas emissions in half. There are interesting implications for worldwide energy policy if this analysis stands up to criti\u00ad cal review. We hope readers and others will spell out concerns or sug\u00ad gest corrections so we can collectively improve die analysis of optimal future power generation. The needed policy changes are deep and fundamental and require a consensus about die best way to proceed. Together we might be able to change the way the world makes heat and power. 32 January/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Notes 1.

June 2001, states power outages and other power quality disturbances are cost\u00ad ing the U.S. economy more than S119 annually. 5. We assembled historical data for four central generating technologies\u2014 oil and gas-fired thermal plants (Rankine cycle), coal fired thermal plants, sim\u00ad ple-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbines. Data for each technology and each year include capital costs per kW. load factor, and efficiency. We assumed a 25- year life to calculate annual capital amortization and the future wholesale price per MWh that would yield an 8 percent weighted average return on capital. Since new central generation requires new T&D. we convened estimates of SI 260 per kW for T&D in 2000 and adjusted for inflation, then assumed a 35-year life for T&D to calculate required T&D charges. EIA did not keep line loss statistics prior to 1989. so we estimated prior years slightly below the current 9 percent losses. Summing produces the retail price needed for power from a central plant using a specific technology installed in that specific year. Finally, we converted everything to 2004 dollars. 6. Typical DG plants employ multiple generators with expected unplanned outages of 2 percent to 3 percent each. The probability of complete loss of power is found by multiplying expected unit unplanned outages by each other. Given the existing 10.286 genctators operating in the U.S. that are less than 20 megawatts of capacity, and the expectation, with barriers removed, of many DG plants inside every distribution network, spare grid capacity equal to 10 percent of installed DG should be more than adequate to cover unplanned outages. 7.

Producers of electricity are given fossil foci usage credits, meaning they ate allowed to use a given amount of fossil fuels corresponding to efficiency, size of unit and other environmental parameters. Thus, the higher the effi\u00ad ciency of a company's unit, the less fossil foci credits that company needs to use. The highly efficient plants and generation plants using a non-fossil foci energy such as solar, wind, or hydro power would not need the foil allowance and could sell the unused portion to less efficient fossil fueled plants.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 33 Exploring Controversies in the Art and Science of Polygraph Testing Polygraph testing has always been controversial, with a wide gulf separating practitioners from scientists with relevant expertise. Myths about its alleged objectivity and infallibility stem from a failure to recognize that the polygraph simply records physiological responses and that the validity with which deception can be diagnosed depends on the nature of the examination and its social context. JOHN RUSCIO Polygraph or \"lie detector\" tests have been conducted extensively in the United States since the early twenti\u00ad eth century, with comparatively little popularity else\u00ad where. The technique has been used to aid in criminal inves\u00ad tigations, civil disputes, and the screening of job applicants and current employees. Polygraph testing has been contro\u00ad versial since its inception, with a substantial gulf separating practitioners from scientists with expertise in psychophysiol- ogy, measurement, decision making, and related disciplines. Aside from a trend toward computerized recording and scor\u00ad ing of polygraph charts, there has been little fundamental change in the technology or its implementation in the past fifty years, and a number of widespread myths persist despite 34 January/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER the lack of noteworthy advances in the field. Among the lay public, the press, and policy makers, confusion about the alleged objectivity and infallibility of polygraph testing often stems from a failure to recognize that the polygraph is simply a device to record physiological responses and that the validity with which deception can be diagnosed from such responses depends on the nature of the examination that is performed and its social context. My goal in this article is to dispel some of these myths by describing the different types and uses of polygraph tests, as well as empirical findings and additional considerations bearing on the vaJidity and utility of those tests. Two Pervasive Myths of Polygraph Testing Many people perceive polygraph testing to be an objective way to distinguish honesty from deception, a scientific practice that is carried out in an impartial manner. The gadgetry of die stan\u00ad and respiratory responses\u2014may be responsible for this scientific mystique, yet with the exception of one type of appli\u00ad cation, polygraph testing has been developed and promoted primarily by nonscientists (Lykken 1998). A polygraph exami\u00ad nation involves a lengthy pretest interview during which the examiner gains access to a wealth of background information and formulates specific questions that are then used during the test phase, when physiological responses are recorded. The type of questions that are constructed and the interpersonal manner with which they are posed can have a significant influence on the examinee's physiological responses. Moreover, the scoring and interpretation of the polygraph chart also require subjective judgments that can be influenced by an examiner's preconcep\u00ad tions, and there remains a critical need for well-validated com\u00ad puterized scoring and interpretive systems. An expose\" on private polygraph firms aired by 60 Minutes in 1986 underscores the subjectivity of the process and its suscepti\u00ad bility to confirmation bias due to the contamination of an exam\u00ad iner's diagnosis with information obtained outside of the formal polygraph test. As summarized by Ben-Shakhar (1991, 236): Three different polygraph firms were independently called to test an alleged theft of a camera and lens from a photography magazine office employing four employees. In fact, nothing was stolen from the office, but the polygraph examiners were told that it could only have been done by one of the four employees. Each polygraph examiner was told that \"it might have been ,\" with a different employee being fingered in each case (a decidedly weak fingering). In each case, the poly\u00ad graph examiner identified the \"fingered\" employee as decep\u00ad tive, and cleared the other \"suspects.\" Moreover, all polygraph examiners expressed complete confidence in their decisions. This demonstrates not only that polygraph examiners can go wrong, but that their judgment and decision-making processes are infected by a systematic and powerful source of bias, a bias caused by contamination. In addition to potential biases in the administration and interpretation of a polygraph test, it is important to note that there are no unique physiological indices of deception (Lykken 1998; National Research Council [NRC) 2003). A number of psychological states influence the processes measured by the polygraph. For example, even innocent suspects may be alarmed or aroused by questions that imply wrongdoing, and the fact that examinees recognize that they may be fined, fired, imprisoned, or otherwise sanctioned based on their responses to key questions can often cause them to exhibit many of the behavioral and physiological reactions often believed to be uniquely indicative of deception. In its review of the polygraph literature, the NRC (2003) faulted proponents for failing to establish a plausible theoretical base linking polygraph responses to deception or to draw from relevant basic science research to measure those physiological processes that are likely to yield the greatest validity. For example, certain mea\u00ad sures of brain activity show considerable promise as physiolog\u00ad ical responses that are less susceptible to countermeasures because of their rapidity and automaticity, yet there is litde ongoing research to suggest a serious interest in improving polygraph technology (NRC 2003). A second myth involves alleged infallibility of polygraph testing, the notion that the technique can be used to distin\u00ad guish honesty from deception without error. Proponents derive much of their confidence from understandable but seri\u00ad ously flawed inferences. For example, Lykken (1998) cites a statement made by one polygrapher who testified before the Minnesota legislature in 1975 that he'd given more than 20,000 polygraph tests and had \"never been shown to have made a mis\u00ad take\" (69). Because polygraph tests are ordinarily administered when other evidence is weak, one may never know with reasonable He's lying J He's telling the truth. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 35 certainty whether the examinee was in fact guilty of the alleged misconduct; that is, \"ground trurh\" remains unknown. To the extent that polygraph results are taken to be definitive, further investigation is seldom undertaken to determine the validity of the inferences drawn from polygraph tests. Another flawed source of intuitively compelling support stems from the fact that many examinees make confessions or offer damning admissions after an examiner suggests that their responses were deceptive. Such confessions are insufficient to establish the validity, much less the infallibility, of the poly\u00ad graph test itself for at least two reasons. First, many confessions themselves are false statements, perhaps offered in an attempt to mitigate the consequences of having failed the polygraph test. In some instances, examinees' own faith in the infallibil\u00ad ity of the polygraph has caused them to doubt the accuracy of their own memory, supposing that they must be guilty of the alleged offense even if they cannot recall it (Lykken 1998). A second problem with using confessions as the criterion against which to evaluate the validity of polygraph testing is that this introduces a substantial bias. A study by Murray (1989) nicely illustrates this flawed logic. Of the 552 actual criminal suspects given polygraph tests, 239 (43%) were diag\u00ad nosed as deceptive and were pressed for confessions; 104 (44%) of these individuals confessed, and 3 other individuals were later cleared by the confessions of other suspects. The 313 suspects diagnosed as nondeceptive were not pressed for con\u00ad fessions, but 18 (6%) of them were cleared by subsequent con\u00ad fessions of others. Noting that only 3 errors had been docu\u00ad mented (the individuals diagnosed deceptive who were later cleared by others' confessions), Murray reported an accuracy of 99.4% for the polygraph. This conclusion is entirely unwar\u00ad ranted, as it presumes that the remaining 132 individuals diag\u00ad nosed deceptive who did not confess were in fact guilty and that the remaining 295 individuals diagnosed honest who did not confess were in fact innocent, yet there was no indepen\u00ad dent corroboration of any individual's guilt or innocence. To see just how illogical Murray's conclusion is, consider the fact that equal (or perhaps even superior) results may have been obtained by tossing a coin to diagnose deception rather than actually scoring and interpreting the polygraph charts. Roughly half of all suspects would be diagnosed deceptive by the coin toss, and a substantial proportion would no doubt have confessed (keeping in mind that the base rate of guilt in this sample was quite high). Likewise, among the half of all suspects diagnosed honest by the coin toss, some would later be cleared by the confessions of others. The proper way to calculate the empirical accuracy of poly\u00ad graph testing is to establish ground truth with reasonable cer\u00ad tainty and tally the results for tests administered to all exami\u00ad nees, not simply the subsample whose confessions support the John Ruscio, Ph.D., is an associate professor of psychology at Elizabethtown College, One Alpha Drive, Elizabethtown, PA 17022. His research interests are in the areas of statistical meth\u00ad ods for classification research and the psychology of judgment and decision making. His e-mail address is rusciojp@etown.edu. initial diagnosis of deception (even if purely by chance). Likewise, it is essential that those who score and interpret the polygraph charts remain blind to outside information relevant to the case. Otherwise, there is no way to determine whether examiners are making diagnoses on the basis of case facts avail\u00ad able without the polygraph test or on the basis of the polygraph chart itself.1 To date, no field study has been conducted that meets even these minimal standards of scientific objectivity. So just how accurate are polygraph tests? In light of the pre\u00ad sent evidence, it is extremely difficult to reach a defensible judg\u00ad ment and virtually impossible to summarize the results with a single numerical estimate. The National Research Council (2003) conducted a thorough review of the empirical literature on polygraph testing. Although they found the internal and external validity of the studies performed to date to be generally quite weak, especially for field studies, they concluded that poly\u00ad graph testing can achieve results significantly better than chance, but far from perfect. Thus, despite decades of widespread use and ample opportunity to conduct informative laboratory and field studies, the quality of polygraph research remains low and claims of infallibility or near infallibility remain unsupported. Uses and Types of Polygraph Tests Broadly speaking, polygraph tests are used for two primary purposes: in investigating specific incidents (e.g., crimes, secu\u00ad rity violations) and for screening (e.g., evaluating the honesry of prospective or current employees). Although there are sub\u00ad tle variations, two primary types of polygraph tests are used: the control question test (CQT; Raskin and Honts 2002) the guilty knowledge test Lykken 1959; Nakayama 2002; also known as the \"concealed information test\"). I will explore in turn the use of each type of test for each purpose. Specific Incidents When an examinee is suspected of having engaged in a partic\u00ad ular act of misconduct, polygraph testing can be performed using either type of test. For a CQT, the examiner constructs a series of questions that includes items relevant to the specific incident (e.g., \"Did you steal $2,000 from your employer?\") and items intended to serve as a point of comparison (e.g., \"Since the age of eighteen, have you ever lied to get out of trouble?\"). The latter questions are designed to be psychologi\u00ad cally arousing to most examinees, with the presumption that anyone would need to lie (rather than overtly admit to past dishonesty, which would be perceived as incriminating in its own right) because of the ubiquity of at least minor acts of dis\u00ad honesty in everyone's past. Such items are often referred to as \"control\" questions, although they do not provide reasonable controls in the scientific sense of the term. The rationale underlying die interpretation of a COT is that guilty individuals will be more aroused by the relevant than the control items, whereas innocent individuals will be more aroused by the control than the relevant items. Unfortunately, the pre\u00ad sumed directionality of these responses reflects a naive under\u00ad standing of psychology. Because the relevant and control ques\u00ad tions are discussed and agreed upon by the examiner and 36 January/Februaiy 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER examinee during die pretest interview, diey are easily distin\u00ad guished during the test phase. This has two consequences, bodi of which tend to undermine die validity of the CQT. First, bodi innocent and guilty suspects recognize which questions are important for dieir futures, and are likely to feel considerably more direatened by the relevant questions. Not surprisingly, many studies of die CQT reveal an alarmingly high rate of false- positive diagnoses of deception: It is not uncommon for 40 per\u00ad cent to 50 percent of innocent suspects to fail a CQT polygraph examination (Lykken 1998; NRC 2003). Second, whedier inno\u00ad cent or guilty, savvy examinees can take advantage of any num\u00ad ber of countermeasures to systematically increase dieir physio\u00ad logical responses to die control questions, diereby passing die test. Lykken notes diat laboratory studies have shown diat college students can be trained to beat this type of polygraph test in under an hour. One can only suppose diat individuals facing seri\u00ad ous consequences on the basis of real-life polygraph tests would be especially motivated to learn and practice countermeasures prior to dieir examinations. Whereas the CQT is based on several implausible assump\u00ad tions (Lykken 1998) and nonedieless predominates in practice, die GKT has been developed by scientists and holds much greater promise for die investigation of specific incidents. Rather dian attempting to determine die trudifiilness of an examinee's responses to relevant items, this technique aims to assess whedier an examinee possesses knowledge to which only a guilty individ\u00ad ual would have access. To do so, a series of multiple-choice ques\u00ad tions is constructed such diat one choice is correct and die odi- ers are equally plausible to an innocent suspect. For example, one item relevant to a murder investigation could include a number of potential murder weapons, another could include descriptions of the victim's clothing at the time of the attack, and so forth. A total of six choices are usually provided for each question, with the correct alternative positioned randomly among the latter five choices (due to primacy effects, die first choice is not scored). The examinee is asked to repeat each of diese choices out loud, which may serve to thwart potential countermeasures based on self-induced competing thoughts, and a score is calculated based on the frequency widi which die maximal physiological response coincides with the correct alternative. An examinee who consis- tendy responds most strongly to the correct choices is judged to possess knowledge of die incriminating information, whereas an examinee who responds to die correct choices at chance levels is judged not to possess this knowledge. The larger the number of good items, the more accurately one can draw conclusions from a GKT. A good item is one for which the correct choice is salient to a guilty individual, but all choices are equally plausible to innocent individuals. One can pilot-test candidate GKT items on known-innocent examinees to evaluate the latter criterion, but the former may be more difficult to establish. The guilty individual must have noticed the relevant stimulus at the time of the incident and remem\u00ad ber it during the polygraph test. To the extent that a large number of good items can be constructed, a GKT can differ\u00ad entiate those who do and do not possess die incriminating information with impressive accuracy (Beh-Shakhar and Elaad 2003). In stark contrast to the CQT, it is noteworthy that the GKT provides excellent protection for innocent suspects because the rate of false-positive identifications can be mini\u00ad mized by using a large number of items and setting a stringent threshold for diagnosing the possession of guilty knowledge. Field studies of die GKT are badly needed, but for reasons I'll discuss shortly law enforcement agencies have been uncooper\u00ad ative widi scientists who wish to perform such studies. The rationale underlying die GKT is based on the well- established nature of an \"orienting response.\" This is similar to the so-called \"cocktail party effect\" whereby one's attention is auto\u00ad matically drawn to familiar information, such as hearing your own name spoken at a crowded cocktail party. It is especially dif\u00ad ficult to suppress such a response to familiarity, and it would be difficult to systematically increase one's physiological response to all of die incorrect alternatives. To do so would require a large number of self-induced increases and decreases in arousal. This would be difficult to effect repeatedly and would lead to two addi\u00ad tional problems. First, employing countermeasures a great many times may tip off a skilled examiner, thereby signaling the inten\u00ad tion to deceive. Second, it may be possible to detect statistical dif\u00ad ferences in physiological responding if die smallest response con- sistendy coincides with the correct alternative or if fa fewer max\u00ad imal responses coincide with the correct alternatives than would be expected by chance. In other words, the successful use of coun\u00ad termeasures requires that one establish a genuinely chance-level pattern of responding, which would be exceedingly difficult. Aldiough detractors have argued that the GKT may be applic\u00ad able to only a small proportion of specific incident investigations, diis remains an open question. For example, if police investigators began collecting information specifically for die construction of a GKT as soon as they arrived on die scene of a crime, and if diey successfully withhold information from the news media (derails incidental to die story, yet salient to die perpetrator, could feasibly be kept secret), it may be possible to use die GKT quite often. In fact, die technique is being used regularly in Japan (Nakayama 2002). It appears diat die primary obstacle to implementing die GKT in die United States is diat police officers and die polygra- phers they employ are too convinced of die validity of die CQT. Anodier potential problem: Whereas die CQT was developed and has been promoted by the law enforcement agencies, the GKT was developed and is widely endorsed by psychological scientists. Thus, an unfortunate turf batde may contribute to the reluctance to per\u00ad form field studies of the GKT in the U.S.\u2014scientists need the cooperation of the police to conduct such research. Finally, a large- scale switch from the CQT to the GKT may represent an admis\u00ad sion diat law enforcement agencies have long been using a flawed technique, and diis may also call into question convictions diat were based in pan on polygraph evidence. Screening Polygraph testing is also used to screen prospective or current employees. Under certain circumstances, it may be possible to use the GKT to screen employees suspected of committing a particular misdeed. In such \"focused screening\" applications, polygraph testing could proceed as it does in the context of SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 37 specific incident investigations. In the majority of screening applications, however, no particular transgression is suspected. Pre-employment screening and either regular (e.g., every five years) or aperiodic (i.e., random time intervals) employee screening is performed to assess the honesty of employees with\u00ad out reference to any alleged or suspected specific incident in order to predict the likelihood that an examinee will perform acceptably on the job. Given the substantial problems of employee theft, sabotage, security violations, or other cosdy or dangerous misdeeds, past misconduct or dishonesty may suggest a risky hire or die need to terminate an employee. Because no specific incident is involved in these types of screening, the GKT cannot be used, and tests analogous to the CQT must be constructed. Physiological responses to questions pertaining to a number of different areas\u2014such as general honesty or past mis\u00ad conduct such as theft or drug use\u2014serve as points of compari\u00ad son for one another. The use of more general questions likely decreases the magnitude of any differences in responding, and such differences are interpretationally ambiguous in any event because questions about some topics may be inherently more threatening or arousing to particular examinees for any number of reasons. Both of these problems are likely to substantially weaken the validity of such screening tests (NRC 2003). Despite decades of use by private employers and govern\u00ad ment agencies, no field studies have evaluated the accuracy of screening tests in a manner that meets minimal scientific research standards (NRC 2003), and their use is therefore based on unsupported presumptions of utility. There is also no evidence to suggest that prior misdeeds are in fact useful pre\u00ad dictors of future misconduct. For example, admissions of ille\u00ad gal drug use are commonly elicited by polygraph screening, but there is no evidence bearing on the extent to which they predict the future thefts, sabotage, or security violations that the polygraph screening is intended to prevent. Further Difficulties of Polygraph Testing Particularly in screening contexts, there may be an extremely low base rate of deception, which mathematically guarantees a large number of false-positive test results. For example, in the event that classified intelligence information is shared with a foreign power, there may be many individuals who had access to the information, only one of whom engaged in espionage. Screening all available suspects will inevitably yield many false accusations, and may in fact fail to identify the guilty individ\u00ad ual. Altering the direshold for diagnosing deception presents policy makers with a choice between two unpleasant alterna\u00ad tives. On the one hand, setting a low threshold will increase the chances of correctly diagnosing deception in the examina\u00ad tion of the guilty individual, yet it will also increase the num\u00ad ber of false-positive results. All those who fail their tests will be indistinguishable by the polygraph alone, necessitating a large number of thorough investigations. As the NRC report notes, in the context of a low base rate and an assessment tool with as poor specificity as polygraph tests, it is easily possible that one might falsely implicate hundreds of innocent individuals in order to potentially identify die lone culprit. An agency may not have the resources to perform the required follow-up investigations, and there arc a number of problems with revok\u00ad ing security clearances for all those who fail their tests. On the other hand, setting a stringent threshold will reduce the num\u00ad ber of false-positive polygraph results, but at the cost of decreasing the odds of identifying the actual culprit and thereby defeating the purpose of the screening. Clearly, neither option is appealing, and the only way to improve matters is to develop an investigative tool more valid than polygraph testing or to restrict its use to situations in which the base rate of deception is not prohibitively low. Another challenge for polygraph testing involves the high- stakes nature of many situations in which one wishes to diagnose deception. For example, a spy may be highly motivated to learn and practice effective countermeasures in anticipation of subse\u00ad quent polygraph screening. Convicted spy Aldrich Ames passed several polygraph screening tests during his career at the CIA, which may have allayed suspicions of his misconduct far longer than would otherwise have been die case. Thus, when polygraph screening is used to clear individuals of suspicion, normal secu\u00ad rity precautions may be relaxed due to the false sense of security provided by the test results. The NRC highlighted mis danger and advised caution in the use of polygraph testing for security screening. In contrast, innocent suspects may falsely believe in the validity of the polygraph and be less likely to engage in coun\u00ad termeasures and dierefore more susceptible to failing polygraph tests. Or, the scrupulously honest individuals that one would wish to hold top-level security clearances may fear false-positive polygraph results and the damaging effects on their careers and choose to pursue other lines of work. Agencies that use polygraph testing for security screening purposes have suffered immeasur\u00ad ably from the flight of qualified employees who fear the reper\u00ad cussions of false accusations as well as an accompanying loss of morale among the employees who remain (NRC 2003). Conclusions As any proponent will quickly attest, polygraph testing has proven useful in eliciting confessions and admissions of wrongdoing. This provides considerable support for the utility of such testing as an investigative tool even if the tests diem- selves are of imperfect validity. However, such benefits are off\u00ad set by a number of other weaknesses that suggest caution in drawing conclusions from any polygraph tests that fail to pro\u00ad duce such confessions. Moreover, it is essential to verify the accuracy of a confession elicited by a polygraph test. In 1993, the U.S. Supreme Court established criteria for the admissibility of scientific evidence, including general accep\u00ad tance of the relevant theory and technique within the appro\u00ad priate scientific discipline, a known or probable error rate that is satisfactory, standards that maximize the validity of a tech\u00ad nique in practice, and publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals (Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, 1993). Whereas a strong case has been made for the inadmissibility of CQT results as evidence in court under the Daubert guidelines (Saxe and Ben-Shakhar 1999), pending successful field valida\u00ad tion an equally strong case may be made for the admissibility 38 January/February 200S SKEPTICAL INQUIRER of GKT results (Ben-Shakhar, Bar-Hillel, and Kremnitzer 2002). Interestingly, most states prohibit admission of poly\u00ad graph evidence in civil and criminal cases, but many individu\u00ad als foolishly stipulate to the admission of test results. For example, in a criminal case that a district attorney wishes to close due to a lack of sufficient evidence or promising leads, a deal may be offered that many defendants find attractive: The charges will be dismissed if the suspect passes a polygraph test, but the test results will be admissible in court in the event that the suspect fails. Believing in the validity of the test and hop\u00ad ing to bring the ordeal of pending prosecution to an end, many suspects accept such an offer and are then surprised when they fail the test and thereby provide the state with evi\u00ad dence that many jurors find persuasive. Likewise, disputants in civil suits (e.g., both parents vying for custody of their children in a divorce) will sometimes agree to each take a polygraph test, with both sets of results stipulated in advance to be admis\u00ad sible. This, too, often turns out to be a foolish bargain. One can reasonably wonder whether other evidence of dubious validity should be allowed into the court record merely because both parties stipulate to it in advance (e.g., could the toss of a coin be used instead?). In 1988, the federal Employee Polygraph Protection Act prohibited most private employers from using polygraph test\u00ad ing as a screening tool. Private firms, often the same ones that formerly administered large numbers of polygraph tests, have responded to fill this niche by offering paper-and-pencil hon\u00ad esty tests or voice stress analyzers that may be of even poorer validity (Lykken 1998; NRC 2003). However, it is curious that law enforcement, military, and government agencies were exempted from the prohibition on polygraph testing: A tech\u00ad nique judged unsuitable for screening applicants to the local convenience store is still used to screen individuals responsible for maintaining our national security. It is time to carefully weigh the costs and benefits of polygraph screening in each particular context in which its use is being contemplated. The advantage of eliciting confessions and damning admissions must be considered against disadvantages such as invasions of privacy, damage to employee morale, the cost of investigating large numbers of false-positive results and the accompanying harm that is done to qualified individuals' careers, the possi\u00ad bility that the most dangerous individuals may be likely to learn and effectively employ countermeasures, and the false sense of security that can stem from die use of a highly fallible screening tool. In its report prompted by the Department of Energy, the NRC offered recommendations that emphasize a number of steps to improve the practice of polygraph testing and safe\u00ad guard our national security. The report encouraged research on the basic science relevant to the psychophysiological detection of deception such as the polygraph. Alternative processes and techniques that can supplement or replace the polygraph should receive serious study. This research should not be con\u00ad ducted by agencies with a real or perceived conflict of interest. For example, the Department of Defense Polygraph Institute is currently responsible both for the development and evalua\u00adtion of polygraph techniques as well as training practitioners and promoting the use of the polygraph. Open scientific com\u00ad munication of research is also important, with results to be classified only when absolutely necessary to maintain national security. Above all, polygraph results should be interpreted with far greater caution than is currently evident, and policy makers should pay increased attention to the inhetent trade\u00ad offs of false-positive and false-negative identifications that stem from shifts in the threshold used to diagnose deception. The research program outlined above, along with a proper recognition of the strengths and limitations of the psy\u00ad chophysiological detection of deception, is essential to under\u00ad take a realistic assessment of the utility of polygraph testing.

Two articles follow. L Demagogues against Scientific Expertise VITALY L. GINZBURG The fall of the totalitarian Soviet regime brought with it the elimination of censorship, among other things\u2014a great achievement of democracy. But it is a great pity that the new freedom of the press very often turns into the poisonous propaganda of pseudoscience. In 1998 a Commission to Combat Pseudoscience and the Falsification of Scientific Research was created in the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAN) as a step in this direc\u00ad tion. The mission of the Commission is clear from the appeal of the Academy Presidium that was adopted. It begins thus: 40 ianuary/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER At the present time in our country parasciencc and paranormal beliefs are widely proliferated and propagandized: astrology, charlatanism, occultism, etc. Attempts continue to carry out various senseless projects at state expense, like the creation of torsion generators. The Russian population is being duped by TV and radio programs, articles, and books with openly anti- scientific content. The orgy of wizards, magicians, soothsayers, and prophets in Russian government and private media is unceasing. Pseudoscience is trying ro penetrate all levels of soci\u00ad ety and all its institutions, including the Russian Academy of Sciences. These irrational and basically amoral trends doubtless present a serious threat to the normal intellectual development of the nation. The Russian Academy of Sciences cannot and should not view the unprecedented onslaught of obscurantism with equanimity and is obliged to give it a fitting rebuke.' Unfortunately, the Academy's Presidium did not give the Commission sufficient attention. The entire \"staff\" of the Commission consists of a single employee who is often occu\u00ad pied with other work. I can also point to the publication of a book of the Commissions chairman. Academician Ed. P. Kruglyakov, Swindlers Posing as Scientists (2001), but in a laughable edition of only 2,000 copies. Of course, as we all know, the amount of money given to science in Russia right now is absolutely insufficient, but all the same this is billions of rubles a year. Somehow there should be enough to publish this book in a large edition, with free distribution to higher educational institutions, schools, etc. My public and repeated appeals to add Ed. P. Kruglyakov to the large RAN Presidium and entrust him with creating a functioning Commission responsible for all such efforts have not as yet been heard. Commission members HE. B. Aleksandrov, Ed. P. Kruglya\u00ad kov, and myself have addressed a letter to the president of Russia, V. V. Putin, describing the current situation and con\u00ad cluding with the following suggestions: \"1. Have an expert analysis with the aid of the RAN of any project based on the use of new laws of nature unknown to science (antigravity, tor\u00ad sion fields, etc.); 2. Develop a code preventing fraud and the duping of people through the mass media, the creation of an oversight council operating openly, but entrusted with the authority to put careless journalists in their place; and 3. Support the publication of popular science literature at the governmental level.\" At our request, the president of the RAN, Academician Yu. S. Osipov, delivered this lener to the Presidents chief of staff in March 2001. We have not received a reply. I hope all the same that something positive will be done about pseudoscience in the Russian Academy in the near future. Right now I want to make several comments clarifying some aspects of the issue of pseudoscience and the need to combat it. Personally, 1 have already tried ro do this in several articles included in my book, O Nauke, O Sebe, I O Drugikh (About Science, Myself, and Other Things) (2001), and in the article \"About Pseudoscience and the Need to Combat It,\"J HE. B. Aleksandrov's article, and my own \"About Pseudoscience and its Propagandists.\"' By the way, the latter has had an interesting fate. We had to place it in a low-circulation publi\u00ad cation because a number of newspapers didn't want to publish it, inasmuch as one of the shameless propagandists of pseudo- science was named in it and \"journalistic ethics\" apparently prohibits newspapers from carrying such criticisms. Suspicion sometimes arise among even respectable but uninformed people that promoters of new, productive ideas can suffer if scientists struggle against pseudoscience too strongly. In other words, \"who are the judges?\" and who are some elderly academicians to judge what is pseudoscience? For in the history of science, there are known cases when progres\u00ad sive views and new ideas have encountered sharp objections. However, such suspicions of ignorant people (the discussion is especially about demagogues) are the fruit of the purest mis\u00ad understanding. The problem is that all reasonable people (in any case, all members of the RAN Commission) understand pseudoscience as something that contradicts only firmly estab\u00ad lished truths and not merely controversial issues, new theories, etc. For example, in the case of the most well-known pseudo- science, astrology, it has been repeatedly proven that its horo\u00ad scopes are obvious charlatanism.1 And the same is true of pseu- doscientific \"perpetual motion\" designs\u2014in general, any mechanism whose operation contradicts classical (Newtonian) mechanics, which has been verified for 300 years (we're not talking here about relativistic and quantum allowances, which are also well known). However, to expose these and similar pseudoscientific opin\u00ad ions and concepts we don't need the RAN Commission; com\u00ad petent engineers and specialists are quite sufficient for this purpose. The main task of the Commission is to critique more specialized and lesser-known issues. The projects using torsion fields are a good example. Modern physics knows of four types of fields: gravitational, electromagnetic, and the so-called \"weak\" and \"strong\" forces. In theory, other fields could exist, in particular, the so-called torsion field (or twisting field). A similar possibility has already been discussed for many years within the framework of the General Theory of Relativity. Appropriate experiments were set up in the U.S.S.R. and abroad which showed that torsion fields either do not gener\u00ad ally exist in nature or are so weak that they could not be detected even with the most sophisticated measuring appara\u00ad tus. Accordingly, they could not possibly be used for commu\u00ad nications equipment or other practical ends. But there were charlatans who, shrouding themselves in secrecy, deceived mil\u00ad itary and KGB officials and teceived a large amount of money from them for their own (if one can call them) projects. All this has been described in detail in the literature cited above. The Commission (and specifically its members mentioned above) have been fighting and are fighting these charlatans. It would seem mat the situation is as clear as possible, but the \"torsioners\" are finding newer and newer defenders. One of them is Eh. V. Vaytsman, who published an article in September 2002 titled \"Reactionaries Against Charlatans,\" and subtided \"Ordinary authors of scientific articles need to be protected against the caprice of' underhanded opponents'.\" It has been a long time since I have had to contend with such demagogic rhetoric. Mr. Vaytsman also protects \"torsioners,\" although he notes that \"he is quite far from this problem\" SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 41 (and, as I am convinced, doesn't even know what torsion fields are), but, on the other hand, instructs: \"In fighting opponents it is unsuitable for academicians to use an academic adminis\u00ad trative resource, including a so-called 'qualified body of experts'.\" But all of our \"resources\" in this case are just the knowledge of physics, which allows us to warn officials who are not skilled in it not to use government resources to support obviously worthless projects. Each and every phrase in Vaytsman's article is a falsification or manifestation of arrogance. For example, he suddenly states that all three of us (Aleksandrow, Kruglyakov, and myself) enjoy high-quality free medical services. He should be disap\u00ad pointed (or, on the contrary, glad?): I enjoy the services of the academic polyclinic, which is vegetating in poverty, and my colleagues who don't live in Moscow also are obviously not registered with the Kremlin Polyclinic. More important, what does this have to do with the issue of pseudoscience? Scientific Works and the Review Process I don't intend to hold a discussion with opponents of Vaytsman's type, but I consider it useful to illustrate one more way in which people are deceived. This is about the publica\u00ad tion of scientific works; the assertion is that capriciousness is supposedly allowed in this matter, hindering the expression of new ideas. Accusations about the anonymity of reviewers, whom \"fighters for justice\" call \"underhanded opponents,\" are especially popular. What is the process of publication of scientific works accepted throughout the entire world, including Russia? It is the same more or less everywhere, but to be specific and to avoid any inaccuracies 1 will describe how work is conducted in the journal Uspekhi Fizicheskikh Nauk (Successes of the Physical Sciences), where I am editor-in-chief. Any article coming to the editor, including articles by members of the editorial board, myself included, are sent for review. The reviewer can be a member of the editorial board, but most often he plays the role of just one more reviewer. If the review is favorable but contains various critical comments, it is sent to die author for revision, then is usually sent to the reviewer again or to the appropriate member of the editorial board. As a result, if the article is cho\u00ad sen for publication, they edit it and send it to be printed. Can it be done otherwise? Of course not. In the process, die author is obliged to accept the corrections, bodi in the Russian and the English versions (our journal is translated into English). All this is a quite laborious process, done by the entire editorial board and translators. If die review of die article is negative and die member of the editorial board who oversees this field and I agree with the negative conclusion, the author is informed that die article is rejected. Often the author does not agree with our conclusion and informs us of his counterar\u00ad guments, and then die article is sent for comment to anodier reviewer and is considered again. Finally, sometimes after a sec\u00ad ond negative conclusion and my negative conclusion but when die author has new objections, die article is discussed at a meet\u00ad ing of the editorial board. In die course of this process die sur\u00ad name of the reviewer is given to the author only if die reviewer informs the editorial board of his agreement in writing. Can it be done odierwise? Of course not. The review process, if it is honest, is not an easy matter. It is a service the reviewers offer to the editorial board. Naturally, in a majority of cases they don't want to start additional arguments with authors and then be subjected to insults, rebukes, accusations of incompetence, etc., which often happens in the case of une\u00ad ducated or troublesome authors. Such a review process (which the authors of rejected articles sometimes see fit to call \"under\u00ad handed\") has, I repeat, been adopted throughout the entire world, is unavoidable, and is fair. Articles that are nor pub\u00ad lished in one journal are often published in another, including those in another country. This is also a natural process. Various journals have various requirements and often their own specific ones. For example, UFN is a digest type of jour\u00ad nal and we can't even print valuable articles in full, but rather narrowly specialized ones which don't have quite broad con\u00ad tent. There's no discrimination here; the size of the journal is limited and often a great deal of material must be rejected. In journals that publish only original work the selection criteria are different, of course. Doubtless there are mistakes in edito\u00ad rial work, not to mention controversial cases, but what does this prove? We need to try and work better, but it's impossible to print all the articles that come in. Such journals would hardly be subscribed to and read, the work of many people would be lost, and there wouldn't be enough money to publish thick volumes. Unfortunately, the development of the so-called electronic press and die Internet are making this problem worse. Audiors in a whole range of specialties can, without hindrance or review, place dieir articles on suitable Web sites. There even exists an opinion and a tendency to move everything to the Internet and stop printed editions. Many (I among them) vig\u00ad orously oppose such an approach and consider it necessary to have paper journals. The review process and selection of articles by an editorial board are unavoidable. Those dissarisfied with such a method are often demagogues and uneducated people. I can only add that in my more dian sixty years of practical work I do not know of an instance where a truly valuable work and idea in die field of physics was not published. In conclusion, I want to return to the really important issue of the struggle against pseudoscience. Even if the RAN and, to no lesser degree, die Russian Academy of Medical Sciences (RAMN) do dieir duty to protect science in Russia from pseu- doscientists, charlatans, and swindlers by shifting this matter to a Commission, die problem as a whole will not be solved. It can only be solved if all scientists and educated lay people are uncompromising toward obscurantism and fight against it. There are various means available. I will share one of them, which I have adopted for myself. A correspondent from a well-known newspaper called me from time to time asking questions about science. Once I decided to ask whether his newspaper published astrological predictions. The correspondent informed me that, yes, the newspaper did publish them, although neither he nor the editorial board believed in them, but, you see, \"the readers request them.\" 42 January/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER This is a typical case of the mass media duping the public that propagandize and encourage charlatanism we would in pursuit of revenue. I informed the correspondent that I achieve some success. would not answer his questions and in general have anything to do with his newspaper while it promoted pseudoscience. \u2014Translated by Gary Goldberg The journalist has not called me since.

II. Brave Thoughts Are Still Not the Truth Scientists often take the bait of swindlers from pseudoscience. VITALY L. GINZBURG The Academician N.P. Bekhtereva's article \"Censor of All Sciences?\" forces me to make a number of com\u00ad ments regarding pseudoscience and my attitude toward it. Unfortunately, there are many obvious misunder\u00ad standings, confusion of concepts, and demagogy about this issue. I have already had to write about this more than once (in particular, in my book About Science, Myself, and Other Things, 2003). But I will have to repeat some things. It would seem that the term pseudoscience speaks for itself\u2014it is theories and statements contradicting scientific knowledge. But, you know, they are not static. Science is developing all the time and therefore, to put it bluntly, con\u00ad sists of two parts. First, from firmly established and repeatedly Related Articles in SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Special section \"Science and Pseudoscience in Russia.\" with ankles by Paul Kurtz. Yuri N. Efremov, and Edward Kruglyakov and text of a resolution against antiscience. charlatanism, and irrationalism in Russia, SI. July/August 2002. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 43 confirmed scientific truths and laws. Second, especially in the field of new, so-called \"frontier\" directions\u2014in science every\u00ad thing is in ferment and the struggle of ideas is ongoing. Some are victorious and others turn out to be incorrect and are thrown out by the scientific community. Thus only dieories, constructs, and statements contradicting firmly established facts and theories can be declared pseudo- science. Lets say mat astrology is unquestionably a pseudo- science. Other examples of pseudoscience or, as they sometimes say, parascience, include various designs for mechanisms and instruments that supposedly operate in violation of the Law of Conservation of Energy or classical mechanics. But I must emphasize that it is of course impossible to declare ideas and the\u00ad ories pseudoscience mat have not yet been refuted in an experi\u00ad ment or as a result of stria mathematical analysis. All qualified scientists and, I daresay, all members of me RAN Commission to Combat Pseudoscience and the Falsification of Scientific Research, which was created in 1998, understand mis. Its appearance was a somewhat belated and forced measure. An appeal adopted by the RAN Presidium characterized the situa\u00ad tion [see the preceding article \"Demagogues Against Scientific Expertise\" for its text]. There is no room here to discuss the work of me Commission. An article by its chairman, Academician Ed. R Kruglyakov, \"Trafficking in Ignorance,\" published in June 2003, gives a certain picture of it. The facts cited in it are literally scandalous and demand a fitting reaction from the authorities and scientific community. Unfortunately, the fight against pseudoscience has not drawn proper attention either from the RAN Presidium or other \"state\" academies (mainly the RAMN [Russian the academies. The attrac\u00ad tiveness of the title \"Academician\" has led to the appearance of dozens of \"academies,\" which are often far from modern science. It would be useful if these \"academies\" were to fight for the purity of science, including in tiieir own ranks. Here's a specific and recent example. It was reported in one of the newspapers that a Doctor of Technical Sciences and Academician of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences (RAYeN), O. Grinkevich, developed a thermogenerator with an efficiency of about 200 percent, that is, in violation of the Law of the Conservation of Energy. Is it really not the duty of die RAYeN to verify die statements of its members? Not much is required to do diis. Now about N. P. Bekhtereva's article. WitiS its subtide, \"There exists no audioritative criteria of' correctness' in die knowledge of the new,\" I think the overwhelming majority of scientists would agree completely. But what does this have to do wim the strug- Vitaly L Ginzburg is with the P.N. Lebedev Physical Institute, Moscow, Russia, where he formerly headed the Theory Group.

Leggett (University of Illinois) were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their contributions con\u00ad cerning superconductivity and superfluidity E-mail: ginzburg@lpi. ru. gle against pseudoscience and the Commission's activities? Unquestionably, no scientific statement can be considered pseudoscientific a priori. Ed. R Kruglyakov does not declare the work of die associates of the Brain Institute to be pseudoscience; his criticism is mainly in regard to a phrase that figures in one of the interviews of die lead researcher: \"Right now is the wrong time to express very bold ideas because die Academy has a Commission on Pseudoscience\" and also her letter to President V.V. Putin with a proposal to \"introduce a method of instruction in 'alternative viewing' in die country's special services.\" The phrase cited seems no less insulting to me members of me Commission to which I belong than the words of its chairman which offended N.P Bekhtereva. But, knowing what a \"spoiled/tainted tele\u00ad phone\" is and not having the original text of die interview and die let\u00ad ter to the President, I diink it is impossible to discuss mis issue in detail. Moreover, I should talk about my role in this \"story.\" In 2002,1 was sent an \"O academic journal, Fiziologiya cheloveka (Human Physiology). At about the same time, corresponding member of the RAN V. B. Braginsky and Moscow State University Professor S.P. Vetchanin visited a \"direct viewing\" demonstration in one of the university's depart\u00ad ments. They insisted that die children who were supposedly \"see\u00ad ing\" widi dieir eyes blindfolded also have dieir eyes covered with other bandages. Under such conditions die \"phenomenon\" dis\u00ad appeared. Therefore the Moscow State University professors con\u00ad cluded that in their \"original\" bandages the children were peek\u00ad ing, which was reported to the university's administration, where it seems that such demonstrations were stopped. Since I am not a physiologist I didn't try to investigate any\u00ad thing, but on October 1, 2002, I wrote a letter to RAN Vice President N.A. Plateh (who oversees our Commission) in which 1 proposed that this matter be immediately investigated, for example by creating a commission of experts. And I also added, \"To avoid misunderstandings I should stress that I do not suspect the associates of die RAN Brain Institute of pseudoscientific activity. I only suspect diat they have fallen victim to swindlers, but, of course, diis can only be proven after expert examination.\" NA Plateh sent this letter to the RAN Biological Sciences Branch, which informed me that it was coordinating \"die mem\u00ad bership of an expert commission which would include represen\u00ad tatives of die RAN who deal with problems of fundamental sci\u00ad ence and clinical specialists.\" Obviously they have not \"coordi\u00ad nated\" it yet, but we hope that an expert commission will be cre\u00ad ated at some point to clarify this question. If diis commission comes to a positive conclusion about die existence of \"direct viewing,\" I will be only too glad to congratu\u00ad late St. Petersburg scientists on a great scientific achievement. The suspicion diat the Commission to Combat Pseudoscience is inter\u00ad fering with scientific exploration is completely unfounded. Like many of my colleagues, I think diat press reports about sensational discoveries ought to be well-substantiated and verified. If diis is only about assigning a priority, then it can be achieved by sending an official letter to the RAN. However, as far as I understand it, no question of a priority has arisen in die study of \"direct viewing.\" LJ Translated by Gary Goldberg. 44 January/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Natural Medicine: Will That Be a Pill or a Needle? Many alternative practitioners promise to reveal \"secrets your doctor never told you.\" One secret is never mentioned: why alternative remedies are ingested rather than injected. Though most practitioners of alternative medicine are silent on this question, this \"missing information, \" as previously described by Kardes and Sanbonmatsu (2003), is crucial for evaluating the promised cure. WILLIAM H. BAARSCHERS So-called natural medicines, usually herbs or supple\u00ad ments, are invariably things to eat or drink. And why not? Ever since the appearance of pharmaceuticals in the early 1800s, the doctor's prescription, legible only to a pharmacist, would nearly always get you something to swal\u00ad low\u2014a liquid, a pill, or a powder; an extract of senna leaves to relieve constipation, for example, or a \"headache powder.\" Only occasionally would the prescription get you something to rub on your skin, like a salve. Today, medication still comes mostly in pill or capsule form. By the late 1800s, Louis Pasteur's work with microorgan\u00ad isms brought about the first vaccines, for anthrax and rabies. BCG (bacillus Calmette-Guerin) vaccine against tuberculosis SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 45 appeared in 1921, and by 1955, Jonas Salk developed his polio vaccine. These vaccines could not be swallowed, they had to be injected. With a needle. But inflicting pain is unpleasant and discourages parents from bringing their children for vaccina\u00ad tion. Therefore, Albert Sabin's 1965 oral polio vaccine was an important discovery. The 1960s also brought the oral contraceptives\u2014birth- control pills. Carl Djerassi, a chemistry professor at Stanford University known as \"the father of the birth-control pill,\" pre\u00ad ferred to \"chemical fertility control.\" What was so spe\u00ad cial about oral polio vaccine and oral contraceptives? Did we not always swallow our medicines? Why were these oral med\u00ad ications such a breakthrough? Although polio vaccine and birth-control pills are far apart in the pharmaceutical spectrum, the reason for the importance of \"oral\" is the same. Research often yields promising compounds that act on microorganisms or on cell cultures in vitro, in the shallow glass vessels called petri dishes. Next, the potential remedy is tested on animals, usually via a syringe. How does it get to be a pill? Or does it? From Needle to Pill Progesterone is a hormone secreted during pregnancy. One of its func\u00ad tions is to prevent the fertilization of other egg cells. It is the natural form of birth control, but it cannot be used as a pill. Progesterone is absorbed readily through the intestinal wall and is quickly metabolized on its first pass through the liver. Its half-life in the blood stream is about five minutes (Katzung 1998). Chemically mod\u00ad ifying die progesterone molecule avoids diis problem. That modifi\u00ad cation allowed die development of the Pill. The moment we swallow something, what we eat starts on an obstacle course toward its destination. Enzymes in saliva begin the attack. Then die strongly acidic environment in the stomach alters many food molecules. Chemicals diat survive this far face the digestive enzymes on their way through the small intestine. Eventually, some useful products of the break\u00ad down of our food are absorbed through the intestinal wall into William H. Baarschers is a professor emeritus of chemistry at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ontario. His research inter\u00ad ests have included the chemistry of medicinal plants, synthetic chem\u00ad istry, environmental science, and industrial toxicology.

Odiers are fermented by the bacteria in our colon, and still others are excreted. More hurdles wait in the bloodstream. Portal blood carries absorbed food-derived molecules first to the liver, which can metabolize a chemical, be it food or medicine, before it reaches the systemic circulation. It's quite a steeplechase for whatever we eat. Like the family doctor of old, alternative healers also give us pills or teas. After all, we have been conditioned to accept med\u00ad icine as something we eat, never mind who recommends or prescribes it. But there is a difference between the alternative and the conventional. We invariably eat or drink the herbalist's prescriptions. But physicians, although they prefer to prescribe pills or capsules, must sometimes reach for the needle, because many effective drugs do not cope well with the rigors of our digestive tract. A drug's susceptibility to digestion or its poor absorption through the intestinal wall result in poor bioavailability. Such drugs must be injected to bypass the digestive system. The alternative-medicine approach rarely considers the bioavailability question. Of an annotated list of North American prescription drugs, fully one third cannot be taken orally for these reasons (Springhouse Cor\u00ad poration 1996). They are injected, usually by a nurse or a doctor. In contrast, the complementary approach holds to the view that good medicine, provided by nature, comes from plants. It should be eaten, even if the extract must be sealed in a capsule. Strangely, although chemical laboratories are not kindly thought of by herb users, buying herbal extracts sealed into laboratory-made capsules does not seem to be a problem. An early step in testing new drugs is determining how the drug reaches the target organ, how much enters the circula\u00ad tion, and how quickly it is metabolized or excreted. Without knowing this pharmacokinetic behavior, we cannot predict what happens after we swallow the pill, the capsule, or the tea. A chemical called amygdalin, extracted from peach or apri\u00ad cot pits, was touted throughout the 1970s as an anticancer drug under the name Laetrile and became the subject of much controversy. While some alternative healers still believe Laetrile is a cancer drug, conventional medicine has rejected it. Laetrile molecules consist, in the chemical sense, of three smaller building blocks: benzaldehyde, glucose, and hydro\u00ad cyanic acid. The last one is a highly toxic chemical, the \"cyanide\" of detective stories and gas chambers. The reason for rejecting Laetrile is its pharmacokinetic behavior. When injected into cancer patients, it was quickly 46 January/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER and almost completely excreted in the urine (Moertel et al. 1981). Given orally, it is rapidly split into its building blocks by stomach acid, causing elevated but nonlethal blood levels of cyanide. Since injected Laetrile is not absorbed, and if orally administered, the drug is destroyed by digestion, whatever it does to cancer cells in a lab is irrelevant. Magic Mushrooms Laetrile nicely illustrates the bioavailability problem with oral remedies, but there is a much more romantic example. The shi\u00ad itake mushroom has an important place in both the food and the medicine of Asian countries, particularly China and Japan. A mushroom's overnight appearance, seemingly out of nowhere, must have seemed like pure magic to our ancestors. No wonder mushrooms have been used as both food and med\u00ad icine in virtually all cultures for thousands of years. Some were just considered good treatment for common ailments. Others were powerful \"medicine,\" consumed by shamans in religious ceremonies (Schultes and Hofmann 1979). Hallucinogens in these mushrooms are closely related to dopamine and sero\u00ad tonin, chemicals directly involved in brain function. Mushrooms are also food. The nutritional value of the shi\u00ad itake is similar to that of other vegetables. It is about 90 percent water, some carbohydrates, some minerals, small amounts of vitamin C, and a iitde protein, although shiitakes protein con\u00ad tent is only half diat of die oyster mushroom (Chang 1980). A little mycology, or fungus science, helps to appreciate die shiitake story. The often-invisible, underground part of a fungus is the mycelium, or vegetative pan. It grows in soil, in wood, or other organic debris. The spore-bearing fruiting bodies are die actual mushrooms. They are formed only when conditions of temperature, humidity, and the fungus' stage of growth are just right. The shiitake belongs to the white-rot fungi, which grow on rotting wood and slowly break it down for the benefit of other forest dwellers. Mycelium of white-rot fungi, grown in culture, is used to biodegrade some food processing wastes (Vinciguerra et al. 1995). But it is the fruiting body, the actual mushroom, mat goes so well widi diat juicy steak. Shiitake mushrooms have played an important role in ancient Asian medicine because riiey contain two notable chemicals. One is reported to be an anticancer compound, and the other can lower blood cholesterol. Mushrooms and Lemons The reported anticancer effect of shiitake mushrooms has a prominent place in modern complementary-medicine litera\u00ad ture. Although not always explicidy mentioned as a reason for eating die mushrooms, die suggestion is there when we see a story on die anticancer effects of shiitake illustrated with a fresh, delectable mushroom (McCaleb 1994). Other advice explicitly states that eating shiitake helps to resist tumors, whatever \"resisting tumors\" means (Bremness 1994). In North America, shiitakes are a tasty, luxurious companion to steak and red wine. Are they also an expensive medicine? Shiitake mushrooms first appear in die scientific literature around die late 1960s (Maeda and Chihara 1971). The mole\u00adcular structure of die isolated active compound, lentinan, was found to be that of a carbohydrate. Not very exciting\u2014what could be more common than a carbohydrate? Nevertheless, numerous scientific reports on lentinans anticancer potential have appeared during the past forty years, and they continue to appear. Lentinan appears to slow tumor growth, but most experiments are with cell cultures or small numbers of animals (Suzuki et al. 1994). Lentinan does not kill cancer cells\u2014it is not cytotoxic. Association of carbohydrates with the surface of cells plays a role in the \"recognition\" tasks of those cells\u2014an important part of our immune system. Lentinan is believed to support those immune system tasks. Consequently, such chemicals have been called \"immune-response modifiers.\" Similar carbohydrates are found in other mushrooms, like maitake and reishi. Chinese herbal medicines Hunang Qi {Astragalus) and Dankei (Angelica) ace called immune modifiers in an American patent (Liu 1989). A carbohydrate found in ordinary wheat straw also has immune modifying properties (Nakahara et al. 1967). There is more tempting news. Citrus pectin is also a carbo\u00ad hydrate, the soluble fiber we find in many fruits. News about citrus pectin in relation to prostate cancer was illustrated with a good-looking, juicy lemon (Webb 1997). The question is obvious: If forty years of research show readily available, cheap carbohydrates to be cancer-fighting and immune strengthen\u00ad ing, why do we still not have a carbohydrate-type anticancer drug? Is the \"medical establishment\" missing the boat? Cancer Drugs? Let's stan widi the mushroom. Most of die literature reports on lentinan are in Japanese scientific journals, widi English sum\u00ad maries in Chemical Abstracts\u2014about a thousand studies in the past diirty-five years. What a remarkable interest in a gourmet mushroom. The critical question is: How was die lentinan applied? In a random sample of a couple of hundred of these repons, about rwo-diirds mention die use of injections. Some patents describe \"injectable solutions\" (Guo and Liu 1993). The remaining reports simply stated diat lab animals were \"treated\" with lentinan. A rare citation mentions oral application. Lentinan is a large carbohydrate molecule that would not be absorbed through the intestinal wall. Taken by mouth, lentinan is either digested, like starch, or more likely, it is a nondigestible carbohydrate, like pectin or cellulose (Noah et al. 1998). As a dietary fiber, either it will be fermented in the colon or it will be excreted. Lentinan, if it is a drug at all, would have to be an injectable drug. The literature regarding lemon is different. It specifically mentions diat oral administration of the modified pectin inhib\u00ad ited die metastasis of prostate cancer in rats (Pienta et al. 1995). The citrus pectin was quite extensively modified, by way of a well-established laboratory procedure for panially breaking down die large pectin molecules into much smaller fragments, which may well be small enough to pass through die intestinal wall. What reduced metastasis in die rats was not a \"complex carbohydrate\" but radier a much smaller molecule. Nobody knows, as yet, what die human digestive system would do to it. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 200S 47 And why citrus pectin? Because it is convenient and readily available from chemical-supply companies. Pectin from any other source, like apples, could well have given similar results (Nakahara et al. 1967). The lemon connection was coinciden\u00ad tal. Illustrating the story with a fresh lemon made it attractive, but the research had nothing to do with eating lemons. The \"herbal connection\" was purely symbolic. These studies are important. This is basic research that reveals interactions of specific carbohydrates with mammalian metabolism. Carbohydrates, the primary products of photo\u00ad synthesis in plants, are abundant, cheap, and renewable. Plants make them in enormous variation and in huge quantities. They are used as food and food additives and in various med\u00ad ical applications. At least six herbal plants with a very high content of the so-called carbohydrate hydrocolloids, like pectin, are routinely used in Europe. Since carbohydrates interact so readily with other chemicals, including enzymes, a long list of \"modified\" carbohydrates has been developed to serve both the food industry and medicine (Franz 1989). Anticancer drugs are not on the list. Policy Issues Even if lentinan has to be an injectable drug, so what? We just found that nearly a diird of all prescription drugs are injectable. Unfortunately, in the case of lentinan, the injection is not a good solution for getting around die digestion problem. The size of the lentinan molecule also causes problems for the needle. Injecting large molecules like carbohydrates or proteins directly into the bloodstream provokes the body's defense sys\u00ad tems. This is the basis of the rejection mechanism of trans\u00ad planted organs. Large, foreign molecules are recognized by our immune system as invaders, like viruses and bacteria. Several research reports on lentinan comment on blood-vessel dilation and internal bleeding caused by the injections (Maeda et al. 1992). This is one of the reasons the American National Cancer Institute (NCI) excludes from further investigation all compounds that turn up in that organization's screening pro\u00ad grams and that arc either carbohydrates, proteins, or tan\u00ad nins\u2014the large molecules that are likely to provoke immune reactions (Cragg et al. 1995). Not all scientific opinion agrees with NCI's policy; investi\u00ad gation into the medicinal potential of carbohydrates continues in many places (Franz 1989). This work on carbohydrates is just another small battle in the \"war on cancer,\" and it will probably carry on for a while. But so far, the carbohydrate approach has not yielded an anticancer drug. Cholesterol and a Juicy Steak A further, curious wrinkle in die shiitake story has to do with another killer, heart disease. Another chemical in diis fungus was found to lower blood-cholesterol levels. The chemical, ini\u00ad tially called lentinacin, first appeared in die literature in 1969 (Chibata et al. 1969). Shortly afterward, chemists changed its name to eritadenine. It was reported to be ten times more effective in lowering blood cholesterol dian clofibrate, a first- generation synthetic drug for treating hypercholesterolemia (Spoerke and Rumack 1994). However, eritadenine disap\u00ad peared from the science literature around the early 1980s. Chemical Abstracts indexes of the past fifteen years no longer mention it. Perhaps that is just as well. A synthetic preparation of eritadenine would, of course, be perfectly identical to what the mushroom produces. But it would have to go through the same costly testing protocol as other drugs before it could become clinically available. That would make it much more expensive than gourmet mushrooms. The behavior of a chemical in our digestive system and in the bloodstream is very important. For legal prescription drugs, this pharmacokinetic behavior is studied and is known. For many herbal remedies and plant extracts it is not known. It is a secret your (naturopathic) doctor never told you. Many plant extracts have useful medicinal properties, but we need to know if we have to take them as a pill or through a needle . .. or as a juicy steak with mushrooms. References Bremness.

By Michio Kaku. Atlas books. W.W. Norton & Company, New York. 2004. ISBN 0-393-05165-X. 251 pp. Hardcover, $22.95. The year 2005 brings the centen\u00ad nial of the publication of the seventeenth volume of Annalen der Physik, one of the leading academic physics journals of its day. This particu\u00ad lar issue has achieved a legend all its own, because its contents included three papers by a hitiierto obscure patent clerk and physicist named Albert Einstein. Addressing the topics of statistical mechanics, eiectromagnetism, and rela\u00ad tivity, the author painstakingly and clearly laid out a vision of time, space, and the physical forces of die universe that would eventually transform our understanding of our place in time and the universe. Einstein's \"miracle year\" of 1905 did not come about easily. As Michio Kaku depicts in his nimbly written and absorbing new biography, the path to this breakthrough was strewn with acad\u00ad emic setbacks and hardships due to young Einstein's very individualistic learning methods. Balking at the point\u00ad less rigidity of German schooling, Einstein grew to become an accom\u00ad plished autodidact both from orienta\u00ad tion and necessity. Difficulties in the use of expressive language led instructors of die young Einstein to forsake his educa\u00ad tion, predicting a future of simple labor. His peripatetic family life (his father tried and failed at several businesses dur\u00ad ing Einstein's youth, resulting in many relocations across eastern Europe) also disrupted young Einstein's education. It is an irony treasured by countless par\u00ad ents that the muttering child forsaken by an inflexible educational system was in reality the greatest genius of the age, perhaps of all time. Einstein had to edu\u00ad cate himself, but, more profoundly, he could educate himself, usually far beyond the abilities of his instructors. f ] r I EINSTEIN'S COSMOS ii.-- This blazing mind singed more rfran a few egos, and his attempts at earning a doctorate or even a teaching position were actively thwarted by professors and administrators he had alienated with his superior intellect and impatience witJi their inability to recognize the gifts he possessed. He was finally awarded a doc\u00adtorate just a few months before the pub\u00ad lication of his landmark papers, while still working as a clerk in a Swiss patent office. The reaction to these papers was muted at first, as the science community digested ideas that, if correct, would at the very least amend shortcomings in Newton's theories of motion, but, in fact, would cause an upheaval in con\u00ad temporary views of time, space, gravity, and quantum physics. Eventually the theories were acclaimed, and as subse\u00ad quent experimental testing of the theo\u00ad ries validated Einstein's conjectures, his fame erupted from the enclosed world of mathematical physics into the nascent world of celebrity cultute. In the time between the world wars, Einstein became the most recognized science fig\u00ad ure in the world and one of die most famous by any measure. This burst of fame roughly coincided with an increasing hostility toward Jews in Germany and Eastern Europe, hostil\u00ad ity that was faced by even a nonobser- vant Jew like Einstein. His prominence made him a highly visible target for the rising Nazi movement. A German mag\u00ad azine published an edition listing per\u00ad ceived enemies of the Nazi movement with Einstein as its cover model and a caption reading, \"Not yet hanged.\" In short order, Einstein fled to America, where his celebrity was fixed. Greg Martinez lives and writes in Gainesville, Florida. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 200S 49 BOOK REVIEWS It was while in America, at Princeton University, that Einstein became the tousle-haired, pipe-smoking, sockless, and sweatshirt-wearing figure that is his widely recognized caricature. He spent his time in America working on a grand unified theory, the Holy Grail of physics, but with no success. He used his celebrity for activism (and irritating J. Edgar Hoover's FBI) and charitable works, seemingly enjoying a fame that baffled him, until his death in 1955. Kaku addresses these last few decades of Einstein's life with great sympathy and admiration. Most biographers gloss over this period as the fading glory of a once-great scientist, but Kaku argues persuasively that die groundwork for much latter-day research was laid dur\u00ad ing these years. As Kaku writes, \"crumbs There have been quite a few books on die Piltdown fraud, but this new one provides a good account, and by focusing on die life of die main figure, produces a convincing answer to the \"whodunnit\" of the hoax. The basic story is well known: in 1912, Charles Dawson announced the discovery of a \"missing link,\" a fossil with an ape-like jaw, but a human cra\u00ad nium. Dawson was assisted in his work John Whittaker teaches anthropology and archaeology at Grinnell College and has a particular interest in archaeological con\u00ad troversies and frauds, which are also dis\u00ad cussed in his recent book American Flintknappers: Stone Age Art in die Age of Computers (University of Texas Press). that have tumbled off Einstein's plate are now winning Nobel Prizes for oth\u00ad er scientists.\" Kaku's book, the third volume in WW. Norton's \"Great Discoveries\" series of popular-science books, is a fine accom\u00ad plishment, balancing a sensitive and sym\u00ad pathetic narrative of Einstein's difficult life with marvelously clear and lucid explanations of theories that are truly mind-boggling and genuinely awe- inspiring. As technologies have advanced, experimental science has been able to catch up with the diought experiments of a lonely patent clerk with a seemingly boundless mind, and he has been vindi\u00ad cated repeatedly. The first century of Einstein's influence has been remarkable and thrilling; one can only dream about what the second century may bring. at Piltdown by Arthur Woodward, Keeper of Geology at the British Museum, and the Jesuit naturalist Marie-Joseph Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. According to Dawson, he had actually found some skull fragments years earlier. The gravels also produced a few crude stone tools, an odd worked bone artifact, and some Pleistocene ani\u00ad mal bones. A few doubters at the time questioned whether the mandible and the skull actually came from die same organism, a problem diiticult to resolve since, significantly, the face of die skull and important parts of the mandible were missing. However, further work recovered more bits, including an ape\u00ad like lower canine found by de Chardin, that improved the reconstruction and helped satisfy some of the critics. Most important, Arthur Keith and other prominent evolutionary theorists of the day expected that since the brain was the most important development in human evolution, the earliest recognizable ancestral humans should have a large brain while retaining other ape-like fea\u00ad tures. Piltdown suited them just fine. As paleoanthropology knowledge progressed in subsequent years, Piltdown at first hindered the acceptance of early hominid finds with teeth that looked more modern than their skulls. As these Australopithecines and others came to be accepted, Piltdown looked less and less authentic, and some scholars avoided dis\u00ad cussion of the embarrassing black sheep of the human family. After Arthur Woodward died in 1944, chemical test\u00ad ing in 1949 and a further battery of tests and observations by some of the top play\u00ad ers in 1953 showed that die doubters were correct after all: the cranium and mandible were not the same age or pale\u00ad olithic at all, and the teeth had been filed to make a more human dentition in an ape's jaw. The bone tool was modern, and even die fossil rhino toodi and odier bones came from elsewhere and were artificially stained to match. To most, Charles Dawson has always been the most likely perpetrator. But at the time and since then he has had many defenders who point to him as a respected lawyer and amateur scientist widi little motive for deceit and limited ability to create a large and complex hoax. Many odiers have been accused over the years: the Jesuit Teilhard de Chardin might have wanted to embarrass die scientific estab\u00ad lishment, Arthur Woodward perhaps had a grudge against his museum superiors, and odiers at the time could have had var\u00ad ied motives, including a joke diat grew until it was too dangerous to admit. Russell reviews all die suspects and finds none who would really have had die opportunity to plant a series of doctored remains, regardless of sometimes far\u00ad fetched dieories about motivation. Dawson himself was silenced by death in 1916, but in his life, he had earned a Bits of Bogus Science Preceding Piltdown JOHN WHITTAKER Piltdown Man: The Secret Life of Charles Dawson and the Worlds Greatest Archaeological Hoax. By Miles Russell. Tempus Publishing Ltd., 50 January/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER BOOK REVIEWS considerable reputation as an archaeolo\u00ad gist. Russell's book is a detailed analysis of the scientific career of Dawson the anti\u00ad quarian and naturalist. As a boy, he col\u00ad lected fossils and was befriended by geol\u00ad ogists, donating finds to the British Museum and becoming a fellow of the Geological Society by the age of twenty- one. As he became a solicitor and entered the legal profession, science became his gentlemanly avocation. He continued to find fossils, helped found a museum, joined archaeological societies, per\u00ad formed a number of excavations, and published a series of reports that estab\u00ad lished his reputation for making impor\u00ad tant finds. The heart of Russell's book is a careful and readable examination of Dawson's record, case by case. From abraded fossil mammal teeth in the 1890s (Plagiaulax dawsoni) to the doctored teeth of Piltdown (Eoanthropus dawsoni), Dawson is linked to a series of small frauds, salted sites, dubious reports, and borderline scholarship. Most were plausible and not so excep\u00ad tional that they might raise eyebrows, but each improved the reputation of the author. The best of them solved interest\u00ad ing problems of the day, for example, bricks from the Roman fort at Pevensey with stamps that provided a Roman name for the site, a link to the last Roman emperor ruling Britain, and thus a date that made Pevensey the last major Roman project attempting to defend the island before the Empire abandoned it to the Saxon incursions. Dawson's report was published after Louis Salzman had begun excavating at Pevensey, but claimed that the bricks had been found some years earlier. Conveniently, Salzman found and pub\u00ad lished on a brick with a partial inscrip\u00ad tion, only readable in light of Dawson's find. However, the fabric and the writ\u00ad ing on the bricks is not quite like other Roman brick, and modern thermolumi- nescence dates show that they are mod\u00ad ern forgeries. Patterns emerge that are repeated at Piltdown: Dawson modifies genuine finds, creates new ones, misre- ports circumstances, and plants evi\u00addence to be found by others. In all, Russell finds some thirty bits of bogus science from the hand of Dawson. In light of Russell's work, and that of others to whom he gives due credit, it is clear that Piltdown was only the last and best fabrication of Dawson's career. So many small deceptions had worked\u2014 why not try a really good one? He died before he could reap the full harvest of honors, and long before the progress of science would have exposed him. The lessons for the skeptical observer of science are many. The moral usually preferred by scientists is that science, given time, will correct its mistakes and oust deception (see Massimo Pigliucci's column in this issue, page 20). A less opti\u00ad mistic reading is that among scientists, where truth is valued and good behavior is the expected norm, it is easy to put one over on your colleagues. There were good reasons for suspicion of Piltdown from the beginning: the disturbed circum\u00ad stances of the finds, the uncertainty of the archaeological and anatomical connec\u00ad tions between cranium and mandible, and the convenient discovery of support\u00ad ing finds when they were called for. As in all good hoaxes, the desires and scientific agendas of Keith and other authorities steamrolled the doubts, substantially aided by the reputations and good names of Dawson and his duped associates. Dawson's collaborator Arthur Woodward, who was apparently a victim of the decep\u00ad tion, spent the rest of his life defending Piltdown and continuing to dig at Dawson's sites. The supporting dupe who has too much to lose to recognize the truth is another common motif in frauds. And finally, while we may deplore ad hominem attacks as scientific arguments, Russell's biography of Dawson demon\u00ad strates that the background and scholarly record of a scientist may be of the greatest relevance in evaluating his science. I found Piltdown Man a fascinating book. Each individual case is a quirky vignette of early modern science. Russell explains them well in their his\u00ad torical context, and provides the evi\u00ad dence to evaluate them, documents his sources, and reaches a firm conclusion. He explains details of the Piltdown story, and adds a new dimension to the shadowy life of Charles Dawson. There are a few redundant spots as one part of Dawson's life overlaps another, but on the whole the organization is straight\u00ad forward. For the non-archaeological reader, better explanation of carbon dating and a few other technicalities would help. There are also a surprising number of small typos in a book other\u00ad wise up to Tempus's high standard. Good illustrations represent many of the finds and personalities. There are a few loose ends, as when the destruction of Dawson's papers in 1917 is men\u00ad tioned but not explained, but on the whole this is a satisfying and well- written piece of historic detection that should be of wide interest. From abraded fossil mammal teeth in the 1890s to the doctored teeth of Piltdown, Charles Dawson is linked to a series of small frauds, salted sites, dubious reports, and borderline scholarship.

HINES Ghost Ship: The Mysterious True Story of the Mary Celeste and her Missing Crew. By Brian Hicks. Ballantine Books, New York, 2004. ISBN 0-345-46391-9. 288 pp. Hardcover, $25.95. Ifirst heard of the mystery of the Mary Celeste many years ago by way of a printed placemat at a restaurant on the outer banks of North Carolina. It told the story of the ship being found drifting in the Atlantic without lifeboats, widi no crew aboard, hot meals still warm on the galley table, no signs of violence, the log book still on board, and the crew's posses\u00ad sions, including wet-weadier gear, all pre\u00ad sent. All, or most, of the hatches were open. The crew was never heard from again. The question of why the crew left and what happened to them has been generating interest since the discovery of the Mary Celeste 500 miles west of Spain on December 4, 1872. The mystery became a national, even international, sensation. The fact that Captain Benjamin Spooner Briggs had his wife Sara and two-year-old daughter Sophia on board simply added to the interest in the event. Since then, there have been numerous attempts to explain why the crew vanished. The explanations have run from die mildly plausible (e.g., abandon\u00ad ment in a storm, mutiny, murder, pirates, insurance fraud) to die ludicrous (e.g., disappearing islands, UFO abductions, Bermuda Triangle effects). Hicks tells the story of the brigantine Mary Celeste, starting with the building of the ship in Nova Scoria in 1861. It was not originally named the Mary Celeste but die Amazon. She had held her new name for only three years, when, on November 7, 1872, the ship sailed from New York Terence M. Mines is a professor of psychol\u00ad ogy at Pace University and the author of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal (sec\u00ad ond edition, Prometheus Books, 2003). bound for Europe with a cargo of indus\u00ad trial alcohol. Captain Briggs was a mem\u00ad ber of a distinguished sailing family from die famous maritime community of New Bedford, Massachusetts. He was an excel\u00ad lent sailor, with a well-deserved reputation for honesty. A interesting portion of the book is devoted to Briggs and his family. A pan of the story that was unknown to me until I read this book is what hap\u00ad pened after the discovery of the drifting ship by the American ship the Dei Gratia. At considerable risk to both ships, die small crew of the Dei Gratia was split in two, with half going aboard the Mary Celeste to sail her to Gibraltar to claim her as salvage. It was expected that die salvage hearing would be a short and simple one. It was not. British officials, especially an admiralty-court officer named Frederick Solly Flood, turned the salvage hearings into almost a trial of the men of the Dei Gratia, whom Flood somehow suspected of foul play in the matter. The hearing lasted for months and ended up casting shadows on die reputation of the crew of the Dei Gratia. Toward die end of the proceedings, Flood even suggested diat die missing crew of the Mary Celeste might have been involved somehow. In die end, die court did award prize money to the crew of the Dei Gratia, but the sum was much less than it should have been, the low amount being used as a punishment, even though the court could not prove any wrongdoing on die pan of the crew. Hicks also deals at some length with hoaxes and fictionalized accounts of the Mary Celeste, a section of the book I found among die most interesting. In fact, several of the well known \"details\" in die legend come not from reality but from fiction. The first was written in 1883 by Arthur Conan Doyle, before he created Sherlock Holmes. It was his first major literary publication and appeared anonymously in Cornhill's Magazine. It is in this tale that the story of the still-warm meals on the table first appeared. (No such meals were, in fact, found.) It is also from this story that the common mis\u00ad spelling \"Marie Celeste\" originated. The story tells of the experiences of a New England doctor who was a passenger on the ship and who escaped the murder of the entire crew. The story is written in the first person by the \"doctor.\" It is clear now that the story has numerous glaring errors, but at the time, the incident was recent enough that the appearance of the story caused die ever-suspicious Flood to try to restan the investigation. Doyle most likely intended his story as a piece of fiction, not a hoax. This was not true of odier attempts oudined in the book. One told of the deathbed revelation of a servant to his employer, one Howard Linford, the \"headmaster of a prominent prep school outside London.\" Linford cooked up the story of his servant's talc and published it in Strand magazine, iron\u00ad ically the place where the original Sherlock Holmes stories first appeared. In any book about a mystery ship in the Atlantic, the topic of the Bermuda Triangle will appear, and so it does in this book. Happily, Hicks gives shon shrift to the Triangle nonsense and cites Larry Kusche's superb debunking in The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved. Unfor\u00ad tunately, he does dwell rather longer than needed on the nonmystery of Flight 19. While he certainly doesn't give credence to any supernatural explanations, his description of die events does leave die impression that he diinks die whole thing is still very mysterious. Hicks is appar- endy unaware diat Kusche has also dior- oughly explained that mystery in his book The Disappearance of Flight 19. Hicks's telling of the history of the Mary Celeste and die people and placed associated with her are all first-rate. But, of course, what really makes the book so 52 January/February 200S SKEPTICAL INQUIRER BOOK REVIEWS interesting is die solution to the mystery that Hicks proposes. A common sugges\u00ad tion has been diat the crew abandoned the ship in a storm and took to die lifeboats. But why would one abandon a large ship that was obviously seawordiy for a tiny lifeboat in a storm? Or perhaps the crew thought the ship was about to sink and dius took to the lifeboats. It is true that when the ship was found, there was some water in her bilges, but not enough to worry experienced sailors. And if they really thought the ship was going to sink, they would have taken at least some of their possessions with them, and certainly the wet-weather clothing. In the next paragraph, I will reveal Hicks's solu\u00ad tion, which I find highly plausible. Since the book reads like an excellent mystery story, if you don't want to know the solu\u00ad tion, stop reading now and buy the book. While die crew did obviously leave the ship, diey took nodiing with them. Hicks makes an important point, one appar- endy not made before in die annals of the Mary Celeste. The crew took nodiing with them because they expected to come back to the ship. The ship's cargo was wooden casks of alcohol. This had led to specula\u00ad tion of drunken rages on the part of the crew. But the cargo was most likely indus- trial alcohol, and when it was inspected, it was found to be largely intact, with, how\u00ad ever, several casks empty, likely through evaporation. This would have meant that about 450 gallons of the chemical would have been loose in the ship's sealed hold in vaporous form, posing a serious problem. The only way to get rid of die fumes would be to unseal die hold. But die fumes would have been strong enough to be dangerous to the crew. In the weeks previous to December 4, that area of die Atlantic had had a time of very calm winds, a condition excellent for the buildup of dangerous fumes in the hold and very poor for any attempt at ventila\u00ad tion. Hicks suggests that as more normal weather returned. Captain Briggs ordered the ship \"aired out.\" During diat time, he, his family, and the crew went into die lifeboat that was tied to the ship by what was supposed to be a stout rope, die peak halyard. The plan was that after die airing out, diey would pull and row die lifeboat back to the ship, and all would be well. But, in this scenario, a gale blew up quickly and the rope broke. In fact, die peak halyard was found snapped and hanging into die water when die ship was found. This rope, unlike die odier rigging on die ship, was old and weak. So, die poor crew is left in die lifeboat as the Mary Celeste sails away on her own. A truly horrible and tragic deadi. It seems to me diat Hicks's account is die most plausible and parsimonious one yet proposed for die mystery of die Mary Celeste. It accounts for die more mysteri\u00ad ous characteristics of the ship when found, such as die open hatches and all personal possessions as well as die wet- weadier gear still being onboard. And it does so without the introduction of extra\u00ad neous and unlikely events such as mass murder, waterspouts, UFOs, and the like. In short, Hicks has written die definitive work on this case.

National Geographic Society, 2004. 272 pp. $35, hardcover. In a world where technologi\u00ad cal developments outpace our ability to understand them, John Langone, a science writer and former associate editor at Time magazine, has produced a science book that explains the inner workings of some of the most common technological devices that affect our lives. This is the sort of book that makes a good gift for children, liberally sprinkled with large, lush photographs and clear diagrams. Yet the text itself is sparse and written for adults, with each topic only given four or five paragraphs. The information is necessarily superficial, especially given the amount of space devoted to large and color\u00ad ful\u2014but not particularly informative\u2014pho\u00ad tographs. (Instead of a full-page stock photo of a handful of dead batteries, how about a simple diagram showing the positive and negative electron flow?) Since the Additional Reading section is positively anemic, each entry would have been better had they included sources for additional information. The book is hardly comprehensive but cov\u00ad ers well over a hundred topics, such as auto\u00ad mobiles, tunnels, synthetic fibers, digital cameras, glassmaking, laser surgery, photo\u00ad copiers, and telescopes. Other, less obvious processes are explained in a few paragraphs such as elements of construction, sewing and knitting, and even the Stock Exchange. Entries are cross-referenced, and the book includes a glossary and index. More Damned Lies and Statistics: How Num\u00ad bers Confuse Public Issues. Joel Best. Univ\u00ad ersity of California Press, 2004. 200 pp., $19.95. Hardcover. Over the past months of presidential election campaigning, hundreds of statistics have been tossed around by all sides: Numbers of jobs gained or lost, number of dollars spent on Iraq, per\u00ad centages of unemployed or without health care, and so on. Some of the numbers arc accurate, others purposely inflated or low- balled, still others seemingly plucked from thin air. To help us son through this (often intentionally) confusing mathematical morass, Joel Best follows up his indispens\u00adable book Damned Lies and Statistics. In his new book. Best analyzes and evaluates dodgy numbers from across die social and political spectrum, including schoolyard bullying, the September 11 attacks, missing children, and the number of deaths caused by both lung cancer and falling coconuts. Through it all, Best provides dozens of examples of mislead\u00ad ing statistics and shows that you don't have to be a statistician to identify bogus numbers and their use in fallacious arguments about social issues. Chapters include Missing Numbers, Confusing Numbers, Scary Numbers, Authoritative Numbers, Magical Numbers, and Contentious Numbers. Best concludes with a short but incisive discus\u00ad sion on how to improve the nation's statisti\u00ad cal literacy. He points out that in school and college, \"Statistics textbooks...all but ignore the sorts of issues raised in this book Statistics is usually understood as a branch of mathematics, hence the focus on calculation. But statistics classes largely ignore the ways statistics are used as evidence for under\u00ad standing social issues as well as the ways peo\u00ad ple count.\" This book, like its predecessor, is essential reading for the public at large and skeptics in particular. Bigfoot Exposed: An Anthropologist Examines America's Enduring Legend. David J. Daeg- ling. Rowman & Little- field Publishing, 2005. 288 pp., $72 hardcover, $25.95 paperback. In his new book Bigfoot Exposed David Daegling (an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Florida) guides readers through a forest of hoaxes, eyewitness accounts, and controversies within the Bigfoot community, often draw\u00ad ing upon his academic background. Daegling authored or co-authored several SKEPTICAL INQUIRER articles on Sasquatch, including \"Bigfoot's Screen Test\" (May/June 1999) and \"Cripplefoot Hobbled\" (March/ April 2002). The book is divided into eleven chapters, among them The Natural History of Bigfoot, the Social History of Bigfoot, The Patterson Film, Three Red Herrings, and the Eyewitness Problem. Though there arc dozens of books on die topic, Bigfoot Exposed is one of the first to seriously and critically examine the whole subject from a skeptical point of view. Daegling does not adopt a dismissive, debunking stance but instead examines the claims and controver\u00ad sies clearly and objectively, presenting sev\u00ad eral sides to arguments. The book's scholar-mm ship is also evident in its thorough docu\u00ad mentation and voluminous references. Bigfoot Exposed should be of interest to believers and skeptics alike. Kepler's Witch: An As\u00ad tronomer's Discovery of Cosmic Order Amid Religious War, Political Intrigue, and the Heresy trial of His Mother. James A. Connor. Harper San Francisco, 2004. 402 pp. $24.94, hardcover. Richly told story of Johannes Kepler, the \"Protestant Galileo\" and the father of celestial mechanics and of much of modern optics, set amidst the backdrop of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation and showing not only the surprisingly spiritual nature of early mod\u00ad ern science but Kepler's role as a neglected hero of conscience. The witch of the title was Kepler's elderly mother, Katharina, who was tried for witchcraft in a sensational trial that serves as the author's doorway to Kepler's life and times (he uses never-before-translated transcripts of the trial). A lively, human- oriented history of science and of human irrationality and worse. True to Life: Why Truth Matters. Michael P Lynch. Massachusetts Institute of I Technology Press, 2004. I 205 pp., $27.95, hard- I cover. Michael Lynch argues that truth matters, in both our personal and professional lives. Lynch examines theses including that truth matters, that truth is a worthy goal of inquiry, and that it is good to believe what is true. The dust jacket asks, \"Why docs truth matter, when politicians so easily sidestep it and intellectu\u00ad als scorn it as irrelevant?\" Lynch, an associate professor of philosophy, thankfully avoids the stultifying jargon and impenetrable prose that sometimes accompanies philosophical books like these. It is written for the intelligent lay reader interested in examining the basis for some (apparendy) self-evident truths about truth. Lynch's discussion is lucid (if a bit dry in places), and he tackles postmodern philoso\u00ad phers who suggest that truth is subjective and irrelevant. A good companion to Sissela Bok's book Lying. True to Life is an insightful and timely examination of the ultimate basis for skepticism: that what is true matters. \u2014Benjamin Radford and Kendrick Frazier 54 January/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER FORUM It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's... an Angel? DAVE BROOKS Logic is a wonderful thing\u2014 which makes it kind of alarming to find out how easily our minds will heave it out the window. Ask Bob Peret, a Sun Micro\u00ad systems software engineer, who was outside his Mont Vernon home one night when he and eight friends, relaxing after a mountain-bike ride, spotted a bizarre glowing object in the sky. Here's how Peret described it in an e-mail: \"It was approxi\u00ad mately the size of the moon. It looked like two overlapping disks. I took out my binocu\u00ad lars, and ... it looked like a horizontal line with wisps arching off the top and bottom on each side. It slowly drifted east- northeast, and faded away after about an hour.\" Very odd. But even odder, at least to Peret, was part of his reaction. He later recalled: \"I'm an analytical person, I'm an engineer. But when my friend said, 'It looks like an angel,' I said, 'You know, it does look like the wings of an angel,' and for a split second it runs through my mind: 'That's an angel, and it's the end of the world!'\" Before donning sackcloth and ashes or carrying a sign down Main Street warning, \"The end is nigh,\" however, Peret came to his senses. \"Then I thought, nah,\" he said. With such certainty is superstition held at bay. As an enthusiastic backyard astron\u00ad omer who has seen lots of odd stuff in the sky, Peret has more defenses than most of us against succumbing to the exotic lure of die unknown. That lure goes something like this: \"I can't think of a natural explanation for what I think I'm seeing, therefore it must have a supernatural cause.\" Poke hard enough and you'll find such a thought process behind most UFOs, ghosts, alien visitations, and what have you. Peret knew several possible expiana- tions for what he was seeing, although they didn't seem quite right. One is noc- tiluccnt clouds, which are so high up diat the sun illuminates diem long after it has set; anodier is exploding meteors, which create a debris cloud that can also catch post-sunset rays. Still dissatisfied, Peret e-mailed me the next day (my helpful response: \"I don't know\") and then went to the Source of All Knowledge, the Internet. There, he hunted down an article on Space.com explaining what he had seen. Turns out, his angel was a NASA rocket releasing excess fuel in the upper atmosphere at about 9 P.M. on August 31, 2004, after launching a National Reconnaissance Office satellite. \"Dumping excess fuel is the usual prac\u00ad tice for all Centaur-booster assisted launches,\" said die Space.com article. \"It happens after spacecraft separation; the fuel bleeding off from a Centaur upper rocket stage on its second orbit after launch. Being just after nightfall, the cloud of fuel was still sunlit at that altitude.\" The article included comments from several other puzzled observers from throughout the Northeast, so our local spotters weren't alone. But it doesn't say how many of diem found dieir worldview tottering for an instant. \"For a split second I was ready to throw away everything I know about science,\" Peret said. \"It's interesting to see how ready you are to give up every\u00ad thing you know.\" Interesting, indeed. Thank goodness most of us don't succumb. Do we? David Brooks writes the weekly \"Science from the Sidelines\" column in The Telegraph of Nashua (New Hampshire).

Of course, we know mis all too well for me or anyone to dwell on this remarkable quality of automystification.

A cursory glance over die history of mankind would seem to suggest this. The question is: Would a much closer study of human societies over the past ten thousand years, from the end of me last Ice Age, say, and the beginnings of agriculture, reveal the natural superiority of individuals and societies that profited over odier individuals and societies that espoused a slightly lower level of convic\u00ad tion in die demonstrably irrational? There is nodiing to be gained in comparing the unreasonable persons and societies with persons and societies possessing total reasonableness, because such persons are at best rather rare, and no such society has ever been known to exist. It is, I suppose, conceivable that some as-yet undiscovered tribe hidden in some jungled valley of Papua New Guinea or along some little-explored tributary of the Amazon exists whose members are, almost to a man and woman, completely sensible and fully cogent, but I think we should not spend too much of our time considering the likelihood. This fact alone points to the burden of my theme: Unrestrained imbecility and rampant insanity apart, natural selection favors the fantastically devout believer in absurdities. Historians and cultural anthropolo\u00ad gists would disagree. Darwinian selectiv\u00ad ity favors the guy with the bigger brain, they maintain, die Cro-Magnon over the Neanderthal. I suggest they think more deeply. Cro-Magnons, in fact, had a slightly smaller brain than Neander\u00ad thals but admittedly that is beside the point, the point being that they had a better organized brain. But better orga\u00ad nized in what kind of way? Conceptually better. They could conceive vastly more, both physical and spiritual, than Neanderthals. In matters dealing widi technology, this was a dis\u00ad tinct advantage. They could conceive, and thereafter bring into being, the bow and arrow, the spear-thrower, the finely flaked axe, and teach themselves how to use these things with exquisite artistry. They could create beautiful paintings of the animals they were preparing to hunt and kill in ritual anticipation of die slaughter to come. They could dance around die fire in propitiation of the gods and appease the divine bloodlust with human sacrifice. The Neanderthal's 56 January/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER FORUM brain was not constructed to allow this level of insight into the spirit world. Moreover, Cro-Magnons had linguistic abilities far in excess of any possessed by Neanderthals. They could speak, con\u00ad verse, tell stories, and deal with matters that no Neanderthal could dream of doing. Cro-Magnons could thereby invent religion, with its gods and demons, a personified Nature of com\u00ad plete capriciousness and with a and vindictiveness won\u00ad drous to behold. A Nature like them- selves; gods that were their mirror image. And, above all, Cro-Magnons could hate their fellow Cro-Magnons with a passion and tenacity that left Neanderthals out of the running, though by then there were no Neanderthals to run, having been in all probability exterminated in the first human act of genocide. Organization is a marvelous riling. What could be more organized and more marvelous a spectacle to behold than a Nuremberg rally, with its flags, its trum\u00ad pets, its serried ranks of thousands or tens of thousands of organized human beings, all shouting exactly alike, all tJiinking the same thing, the epitome, the apotheosis of Cro-Magnon organization. Historians and cultural anthropolo\u00ad gists and the human race in general favor the Cro-Magnon because of all this and because they, we, are Cro-Magnon's descendants, he is us, and therefore we hold him in the highest esteem. Add, too, the fact that it is always the victor who compiles the history books. We never have and never will learn rhe Neanderthal's slant on things. 1 remem\u00ad ber a cartoon in Omni magazine that showed a Neanderthal writing on a cave wall \"Cro-Magnons suck!\" Neanderthals might well have thought something like this. Of course, the real point is that no Neanderthal could have done that. He was not sophisticated enough. But descendants of Cro-Magnon can. Perhaps we had better rethink our ideas about stupid things and which, stu\u00ad pidity or intelligence, is natures darling. Otherwise, the gods we invent in our complex, organized brains may scream at us out of the whirlwind as they screamed at Job when he had the temerity to ask why they were so unremittingly unjust, and point to the warhorse, who, in sub\u00ad lime contrast, asks no questions among the trumpets and only laughs.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 57 FOLLOW-UP Some Reasons for Caution about the Bigfoot Film Expose For skeptics, the revelation of a hoax can provide valuable insights but may also contain pitfalls. MICHAEL DENNETT Over the past three years, the Bigfoot community has been buffeted by the deaths of its two biggest proponents, Rene Dahinden and Grover Krantz. More recently, the death of Ray Wallace permitted his son and nephew to reveal that their relative had faked the \"original\"1 Bigfoot ttacks near Bluff Creek, California. And now, a book by Greg Long, The Making of Bigfoot, has seriously, perhaps fatally, damaged the credibility of the famous Patterson film. (For those readers not intimately versed in Sasquatch lore, the Patterson film has been the best photo\u00ad graphic evidence for the possible exis\u00ad tence of an unknown giant bipedal crea\u00ad ture living in North America.) Since the publication of Long's book, every issue of the Bigfoot Times newslet\u00ad ter has carried critical commentary on some aspect of the book. Editor Daniel Perez, writing in the March 2004 issue, said, \"I think this book [ The Making of Bigfoot] is junk. Don't buy it.\" In the fol\u00ad lowing issue, Bigfoot researcher Peter Byrne called Long's work \"amateurish, impetuous and careless.\" Yet a third reviewer writes: \"In short Mr. Long's entire diesis is based on hearsay and per- Michael Dennett's first SI article on Bigfoot appeared in the Fall 1982 issue. Appropriately, the article was an account of a Bigfoot hoaxer coming forward to admit his involvement in the legend of Sasquatch. sonal opinions of diose he talked with and the dubious claims by one man, Bob Heironimus; that it was him who wore the 'suit' on that October day in 1967.\" But not all reviews have been nega\u00ad tive. The often skeptical UFO newslet\u00ad ter, Saucer Smear, gave the book a good but qualified review,' and not surpris\u00ad ingly, the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER ran an article by Kal Korff and Michaela Kocis based on Long's their article, Korff and Kocis write: \"After nearly forty years of secrecy, the truth behind the world-famous Roger Patterson Bigfoot film has been revealed. The man who actually wore die costume and played the role of Bigfoot in the film has been located and has made a full confession. Moreover, the husband and wife team who made and sold the Bigfoot costume that Patterson used to fake his movie have also confessed, and several other impor\u00ad tant eyewitnesses have come forth with corroborating evidence.\" As a CSICOP Scientific and Tech\u00ad nical Consultant, I feel diat die Korff article may have overstated some of the issues. Having followed Sasquatch activi\u00ad ties in the Pacific Northwest for over twenty years, I am well aware of die key issues related to die Patterson film, and many of die people in die Long book are individuals I have met or talked widi over die years.' I believe it would be more accurate to state that Long has found a man, Bob Heironimus, who has provided a most credible case he was the man in an ape suit in the Patterson film. But The Making of Bigfoot does not, as Korff sug\u00ad gests, prove Heironimus's case. While I find Heironimus believable, diere are glaring problems widi die tale, and SI editor Ken Frazier has granted me this space to present a second perspective. Significantly, Heironimus has no objective evidence that he was Roger Patterson's accomplice, despite a claim made to Long that he could prove he played the creature in the film. He does not have the \"ape suit\" or any other objective evidence. One of die two wit\u00ad nesses to Heironimus's brief possession of die \"ape suit\" was an eight-year-old boy at the time, and the other is Heironimus's mother. Some of the cor\u00ad roborating witness accounts are com\u00ad pletely contradictory as well. Several people interviewed by Long claim that Heironimus showed them die \"ape suit,\" a claim Heironimus strongly denies. These conflicting testimonies show the weaknesses of such accounts and why as skeptics we must be cautious. If we are to believe die Heironimus account (and it is most plausible), how do we incorpo\u00ad rate the odier statements, made by hon\u00ad est-sounding individuals, who say they saw an ape suit in Heironimus's car when he clearly says diey didn't? Greg Long explains in his book that he made no payment to Heironimus, nor was any other financial gain a condi\u00ad tion of the story being revealed. I am 58 January/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER FOLLOW-UP sure this is true. However, Long does not explain why almost a year elapsed from the time Heironimus's attorney broke the story (but did not reveal Heironimus's name) and the time he contacted Long. A possible reason, not known to either Long or Korff, is that another writer was shopping the story to mainstream book publishers. I know this (although I did not know Heironimus's name at the time), because the writer, a former Yakima-area newspaperman, met with me and a colleague of mine over lunch. During our meeting, we were told there would be no book if there was no profit. It was my impression the (as- then-unnamed) hoaxer was a financial partner. I was skeptical the writer would find a major publishing firm interested in the story but offered to help verify, if possible, certain aspects of the account. If I am correct (and admittedly this is conjecture), Heironimus did have a profit motive. All this does not mean that the Heironimus account is untrue, simply that Long did not ask all the hard questions he might have during his mul\u00ad tiple interviews/ Korff tells us that Philip Morris, \"who made and sold the Bigfoot cos\u00ad tume that Patterson used to fake his movie,\" has confessed. The impression Korff leaves is that the Heironimus and Morris accounts agree, but they don't, at least not to me. Heironimus says that Patterson made the costume from a red horsehide, while Morris says his suit was made of an artificial fiber. Heironimus, who owned his own horse and went to rodeos, would presumably know the dif\u00ad ference between horsehide and nylon fibers. Heironimus said the suit con\u00ad sisted of three parts: a bottom, a mid\u00ad section, and a head, while Morris says the suit consisted of six parts, one for each limb, a middle section, and a head. Morris says the feet bottoms in his cos\u00ad tume were black, yet they are white in the film. Morris says the arms could be extended by using sticks for the gloves, whereas Heironimus says nothing about any arm extensions. In fact, if the Morris costume had \"gloves\" it would have consisted of eight parts, not the three described by Heironimus. Korff then goes on to explain: \"Morris distincdy told Patterson how to hide this zipper from view, advising him to comb down the fur on the suit with a brush. Sure enough, this Bigfoot, a wild creature presumably living in the wilder\u00ad ness, is remarkably clean and carefully groomed.\" I don't know how many wild animals Korff has seen, but of the hun\u00ad dreds I have had the chance to observe, including a big black bear last year, I can\u00ad not remember a single unkempt animal. Perhaps a bigger problem with the Morris story is Patterson paying for a suit even though Long's book spends at least a hundred pages explaining how talented Patterson was at making things and how he seldom paid for anytJiing, especially something he could construct for him\u00ad self. As a skeptic, I am unable to accept Morris's story, for I find the account of Patterson's resourcefulness, artistic capa\u00ad bilities, and lack of capital much more believable. Long does establish, beyond any reasonable doubt, that Patterson was a man with the ability, aptitude, and motive to fake a Bigfoot film. He does this through multiple interviews with people who were both friends and vic\u00ad tims of Patterson and then supplements testimony with objective court records, contracts, and photographs. As skeptics, what would we do if someone with a more credible account of perpetrating a hoax stepped forward tomorrow? Certainly, one would think that Korff would have considered this possibility, for in the television docu\u00ad mentary World's Greatest Hoaxes (a pro\u00adgram he was featured in), a man named Jerry Romney, not Heironimus, is iden\u00ad tified as the \"man in the ape suit.\" Romney is even shown doing an impres\u00ad sive simulation of the \"walk\" in die Patterson film, sans the suit. What the two accounts by Morris and Heironimus illustrate is how con\u00ad vincing both accounts can be, when only one can be correct. I find it inter\u00ad esting to read Bigfoot Times and note how skeptical of witness narratives all the Bigfoot proponents have become. When the point of Heironimus having no profit motive came up, at least one Bigfoot proponent pointed out how people will say things for the strangest of reasons, many of them incomprehensi\u00ad ble to others (something skeptics have known for a long time). When the accounts favor a more prosaic view, can Bigfoot doubters be any less skeptical? Notes 1. The legend of Bigfoot predates the famous August 1958 discovery by Jerry Crew, near Bluff Creek, California, of a scries of Bigfoot prints. But an AP story and. later, a True magazine article pumped new life into die tale, and a \"modern\" era of tracks and sightings began. Significantly, this is the same area where Patterson filmed die famous footage. For an excellent account, see Mark Chorvinsky's \"Our Strange World,\" Fate maga\u00ad zine, July 1993 and November 1993. 2. The Saucer Smear article (appearing in two pans in die May and June 2004 issues) was written by co-editor Karl Pflock. and although it praises die book, it also voices reasonable reservations. 3. For additional reading on Bigfoot, sec my articles in SI, Spring 1989. \"Evidence for Bigfoot?\" and Fall 1994. \"Bigfoot Evidence: Arc These Tracks Real?\" 4. Long is a first-class interviewer, yet dierc are basic limitations to die interview format, especially if the subject wishes to withhold information. LJ Long has found a man. Bob Heironimus, who has provided a most credible case he was the man in an ape suit in the Patterson film. But The Making of Bigfoot does not, as Korff suggests, prove Heironimus's case. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 59 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Exposing Columbia's Prayer/Fertility Study Bruce Flamm (\"The Columbia Fraud,\" September/October 2004) writes, \"The study's results could only be described as miraculous. This was welcome and wonderful news for a shaken nation.\" 1 first read about this study in the issue of the magazine The Week dated 19 October 2001, in which Rogerio Lobo (described as a \"Columbia University researcher\") was the only author mentioned by name. 1 was still, of course, pro\u00ad foundly shaken by the September 11 attacks, but, as an alumnus of Columbia, 1 did not consider this study to be \"welcome and won\u00ad derful news.\" 1 immediately sent the clipping and the following letter to the Columbia newspaper, the Columbia Daily Spectator. What is this garbage? Who is this guy? It's easy to believe that Congress can be sim\u00ad ple-minded enough to give credence to Elizabeth Targ and her crew of creedbound dimwits, but Columbia University? My Columbia? I suspect that someone is plot\u00ad ting to devalue my degrees to the level of the (\"state-authorized\"!) Kepler College of Astrological Arts and Sciences in Seattle. (I'm not making diis up. you know.) Very truly yours. Max Siegel Unfortunately, I do not know if this letter was ever published in the Spectator, but I do believe that an outpouring of outrage, disbe\u00ad lief, and ridicule from alumni whenever a major educational institution commits a gaffe of diis magnitude would go far toward sensitizing administrators and public-relations personnel to the consequences of being credulous and naive about less-than- scientific studies. Maxwell E. Siegel Sussex, New Jersey Grateful thanks are due to Professor Bruce Flamm for his painstaking and decisive pricking of yet another (this one apparently impregnable) \"efficacy of prayer\" balloon. If, as seems probable, the \"study\" was entirely fabricated (not the sort of Gedanken experiment Einstein had in mind), the need for replication and confirmation by others is emphasized as the only way science can purge itself of fraud and error. Those who believe in prayer must be constantly dismayed by the capriciousness and apparent cruelty of the Almighty. In the present report, many of the women in the nominally \"not prayed for\" group must have indeed been prayed for, long and fervently, by their nearest and dearest. What are we to make of a God who is deaf to the entreaties of people's loved ones but bends the Divine Ear to the requests of strangers? Bernard Howard Christchurch New Zealand Dr. Bruce Flamm's behind-the-scenes work on the Columbia University prayer study was a great example of how the public can be deceived through legitimate sources of infor\u00ad mation (The Journal of Reproductive Medicine). I can see why the authors would not want to talk with Dr. Flamm, as they pre\u00ad sumably knew about dieir own biases, agen\u00ad das, and histories. But I wonder why the JRM would not answer questions from Dr. Flamm. I wonder when they knew they had such a stinker of a research paper on their hands. I also found on the Web at www.biomed central.com/news/20040614/04/ that Har\u00ad old G. Koenig at the Duke University Medical Center, who studies the relationship between spirituality and health, cautioned that whether the report contains falsifica\u00ad tions still remains unknown. \"It could be a completely legitimate study,\" he noted. He also told The Scientist that Flamm is a \"known skeptic.\" I guess from Koenig's perspective, it is better to be swayed by a \"known criminal\" than a \"known skeptic.\" Carl Perrin cperrin@cableone.net I have little doubt that the study reported by Cha et al. on prayer increasing IVF success is flawed and/or fraud, as suggested in the Editor's Note and Bruce Flamm's article. It should come as no surprise that, as a sub\u00ad scriber to SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, I expect claims to be backed up by evidence and sound reasoning. That said, nothing in the September/October issue did anything to increase my certainty that the Cha et al. study was inaccurate. Neither the Editor's Note nor the Flamm article provided evi\u00ad dential or rational arguments against the conclusions drawn by Cha et al. The presen\u00ad tation presuming to refute the claim of prayer-induced increases in fertility con\u00ad sisted primarily of: 1) an attack on a portion of the study (prayer groupings) that appears irrelevant to the overall conclusion, 2) an \"appeal to authority\" (Occam's razor), 3) a personal attack on the source (for potential unethical behavior in other contexts), and 4) a preconceived disdain for any paranor\u00ad mal claim. 1 will not be renewing my subscription. Jeff Hollerman ihollerm@allegheny.edu Clinical studies of \"healing prayer\" get me thinking about what would happen if such studies actually showed a meaningful posi\u00ad tive result. It seems that before long someone would want to know what parameters lead to the overall success. Was it the number of people praying? Perhaps the wording of the prayers was significant, die religious affilia\u00ad tions of the prayers (or perhaps of the healed/helped). Follow-up studies witli modified parame\u00ad ters would try to identify die critical vari\u00ad ables. Should prayers be directed at God, some particular saint, or other deity? Are there particular people who are more effective than others at praying, and why: denomina\u00ad tion, credentials, piety, etc.? How many peo\u00ad ple are necessary for praying effectiveness? Of course, all of this would raise even more interesting philosophical questions. If God has a plan, why can he be persuaded to modify it? Is God susceptible to group pres\u00ad sure? Why can a group of people who don't even know the target person of their prayers be more effective than the family and friends of the afflicted? Unfortunately, these questions wouldn't be answered by clinical studies. Robin McMeeking Pinckney, Michigan 60 January/february 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Bruce Flamm replies: My sincere thanks to those who took the time to write letters about my investigation oj the flawed Columbia University \"Miracle\" Study. As for Mr. Hollerman, I must point out that the SI article was too brief to include an in- depth analysis of the many flaws in the Cha/Wirth/Lobo study. My critiques pub\u00ad lished in the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine give more comprehensive explana\u00ad tions. In any case, a study design that is bewil\u00ad dering and virtually incomprehensible cannot be called irrelevant to the study's overall conclu\u00ad sions and invoking Occam's razor is not an appeal to authority but rather an appeal to sound principles. An ad hominem attack against one of the authors would be unfair if, as you suggested, it focused on \"potential uneth\u00ad ical behavior\" in \"other contexts.\" However, there is nothing \"potential\" about the author's unethical behavior and it is not in \"another context.\" The author in question, Daniel Wirth, recently pled guilty to multiple felony fraud charges and possible fraud is a key issue surrounding the Cha/Wirth/Lobo study. Finally, I cheerfully plead guilty to being skep\u00ad tical of paranormal and supernatural claims. Anthropic Principle Examined After reading \"The Anthropic Principle and the Big Bang: Natural or Supernatutal,\" (September/October 2004) I can only say that scientists can never say they fully understand the universe. When scientists feel they understand the universe by looking through their Hubble tele\u00ad scope, they then find out more new and mysterious things about the universe that they are unable to explain. Now there is a theory that there was a universe before our universe existed and the Big Bang could have happened many times before, creat\u00ad ing various new universes. The universe could be a continuing recycling machine: it diminishes to nothingness, then it starts anew with another Big Bang, and, voila, a new universe is created. We will never have all the answers, so we shouldn't try. Paul Dale Roberts Elk Grove, California Mark Perakh's analysis of die assumptions behind the anthropic principles is needlessly complicated. \"Abduction\" is a fancy name for hypothesis generation. In fact, Meyer and Dembski pre\u00ad sent a hypothesis to explain the Big Bang. Universes are not usually created by Big Bangs, they claim (\"surprising faa\"), but supernatural creators do it usually with Big Bangs or at least more often so than natural processes. (Genesis?) Clearly, they assume quite a lot about physics and supernatural beings. Bayesian analysis is a sledgehammer to crack this nut. Bayesian analysis is fine if one deals with chance events, i.e., events for which it makes sense to discuss their probability. But \"the probability of a supernatural creation of the universe\" doesn't exist. There are no conceivable experiments that yield an estimate for such a probability. Skeptics should stick to science and not use undefin- able probabilities. The same holds for fine- tuning for life. Life other than the kind we know is hard to define, and the \"probability that the universe is fine-tuned for life\" is another of those unnecessary entities Occam warned us about. Jan Willem Nienhuys Waalre, Netherlands Mark Perakh makes a good case against the necessity of a deity in the origins of the uni\u00ad verse. However, is there really any evidence for such a principle in the first place? The principle, at root, rests on the \"Goldilocks\" concept of the universe being \"just right\" for organic life (and, more specifically, for organic sentient human life). At the present time, the human race, and, so far as we presently know, all organic life, is confined to a single, small planet which does indeed provide \"just right\" conditions (though, of course, much of that is due to our adaptation to the planet, not vice versa). However, the vast emptiness of space is totally hostile to humanity (lack of air, deadly radia\u00ad tion, no TV dinners, etc.). All the other moons and planets that we can study have, to date, proved equally inhos\u00ad pitable. And even most of the Earth (deep oceans, arctic wastes) is hardly what one would call inviting. If the anthropic principal did indeed exist, the evidence would surely be that the universe was created for a being that existed in die vacuum of space, not one confined to a tiny speck in one corner of a cold, deso\u00ad late cosmos. Tim Hill Woodinville, Washington Do we really believe that the universe is truly fine-tuned for life? With humanity forever at war and nearly all life-forms destroying one another to survive, one has to won\u00ad der, why the fight over bragging rights for this subject? Charles Karelitz Honolulu, Hawaii Mark Perakh's article brings to mind a Frank and Ernest cartoon from many years ago which represents the same idea with wonder\u00ad ful succinctness. The disheveled duo are standing in the C.I. A. building in front of the building directory. The directory fea\u00ad tured a large arrow with the message \"You are here.\" Frank observed to Ernest, \"They sure keep track of you, don't they?\" Norman P. Carlson Busti, New York Teach the Controversy' Robert Camp's excellent article, \"'Teach the Controversy': An Intelligently Designed Ruse\" (September/October 2004), overlooks a certain ambiguity in the slogan \"teach the controversy.\" Originally, when the phrase appeared, it was indeed used, as Camp says, to represent \"Intelligent Design\" as \"a combatant in a sci\u00ad entific controversy.\" however, the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture\u2014the main institutional home of \"Intelligent Design\"\u2014is disclaiming any desire for \"Intelligent Design\" to be taught in the public schools. \"Teach the contro\u00ad versy\" is now frequently used to describe the idea of teaching evolution's \"strengths and weaknesses,\" or evidence \"for and against\" evolution, which in practice means misrepre\u00ad senting the mainstream scientific literature in such a way as to confuse the public in gen\u00ad eral, and students in particular, about the sci\u00ad entific standing of evolution. The goal, of course, is to promote creationism. In the wake of the Supreme Court's deci\u00ad sion in Edwards v. Aguillard that teaching \"creation science\" violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, the Institute for Creation Research recommended the same approach: \"school boards and teachers should be strongly encouraged at least to stress the scientific evidences and arguments against evolution in their classes . . . even if they don't wish to recognize these as evi\u00ad dences and arguments for creation. . . .\" SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 61 FILL IN THE GAPS IN YOUR Skeptical Inquirer COLLECTION 15% discount on orders of $100 or more $6.25 a copy.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR So whether \"teach the controversy\" is invoked to portray intelligent Design as sci\u00ad entific or merely to portray evolution as a theory in crisis, the point is the same: to challenge science in the service of a narrow religious agenda. Glenn Branch National Center for Science Education Oakland, California Robert Camp writes that ID proponents \"try to soft-pedal their goals, appearing to desire only to have evidence for and against biolog\u00ad ical evolution covered in science classes. But this is already the case. ... To propose that one desires only that 'evidence for and against' evolution be taught ... is . . . utterly banal.\" Camp further states that one ID pressure group advocates that schools \"(a) teach the evidence for and against biological evolution\" and \" (c) adopt a definition of sci\u00ad ence that allows for consideration of all logi\u00ad cal explanations for phenomena in nature.\" Then he writes \"Of course, no reasonable scientist, or layman for that matter, would argue against either .. . option. Both arc wholly noncontroversial and are matters of scientific procedure.\" Camp views (a) and (c) above as an innocuous smokescreen to package a third unpalatable request, (b), to also permit \"alter\u00ad native theories such as Intelligent Design\" to be taught. Exacdy which schools docs Camp have in mind in which \"evidence both for and against ... evolution\" is being taught\u2014and where the \"evidence against evolution\" is somehow being presented in a way consistent with the various court decisions of recent years? Exactly what sources for the supposed \"evidence against evolution\" are being used by the teachers? What sources are they likely to find outside of the Creationist literature? Should these teachers also be teaching the \"evidence against\" heliocentrism, the microbe theory of disease, atomic theory, and the other central theories of science? Is \"a definition of science that allows for consideration of all log\u00ad ical explanations for phenomena\" problemati\u00ad cal from the pedagogical point of view, when what is meant by \"logical\" is vague and con\u00ad troversial and when it may appear as if there is an infinite number of \"logical\" explanations? How \"logical\" is quantum/particle physics likely to appear to most students? Ronald H. Pine Research Associate Field Museum Chicago, Illinois The \"controversy\" between evolution and Intelligent Design is not scientific but reli\u00ad gious. Therefore, the proper place to teach this controversy is a comparative religion class. In fact, in my twenty years of speaking to public-school comparative-religion classes, the evolution/creationism question has never failed to come up. It has been an excellent opportunity for me to explain the difference between science and religion, between evi\u00ad dence and faith. The class can also appropri\u00ad ately teach the many divine-creation myths in which people have believed. Public schools can teach about religion in the appropriate venue. However, they can't teach religious guesses as fact, especially in a science class. August Berkshire President Minnesota Atheists Minneapolis, Minnesota While I agree that the teaching of Intelligent Design vs. evolution is not the teaching of two different scientific theories, maybe an alternative is to teach competing versions of Intelligent Design. The version the religious Right wants to teach suggests that God is the intelligence behind the design. I suggest that Star Trek: The Next Generation has an equally plausible theory. That show sug\u00ad gested that a very old civilization \"seeded\" the universe. Both of these Intelligent Design theories are equally provable, there\u00ad fore both should be taught. Alan H. Weiner Albuquerque, New Mexico Science and Ethics Ethicist Leon R. Kass, the chair of President Bush's Council on Bioethics. sent this letter directly to Paul Kurtz in response to Kurtz's article, \"Gin the Sciences Help Us Make Wise Ethical Judgments?\" (September/October 2004). We print it here with his approval, and Kurtz replies.\u2014EDITOR. Someone just sent me the text of your very interesting essay from the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, adapted from your Toronto talk earlier this year. Though we do not see eye to eye on all matters, I appreciate much of what you had to say. Indeed, I too have been inter\u00ad ested in nature and ethics for several decades, though I do not hold the modern penchant for reductive explanations as providing a suf\u00ad ficient account of nature, animal no less than human. (You might be interested in two efforts along these lines: Toward a More Natural Science\u2014especially chapters 10-13; especially 13\u2014and The Hungry Soul: Eating and the Perfecting of Our Nature.) But I would not have taken up the electronic pen were it not for your mistaken presentation of my view on human embryos. You claim that \"He maintains that all human life, including a cloned embryo, has the same moral status and dignity as a person from the moment of conception.\" I do not maintain this, and I have never said this. In fact, I have said in print that I am inclined to doubt this view, though I also remain agnos\u00ad tic on the question. I do not know with con\u00ad fidence how to regard the early human embryo, and I doubt that people who claim such knowledge\u2014on either side of the debate\u2014really have it. I do think that any honest biologist in the presence of an embryo\u2014animal as well as human\u2014would be in awe of its indwelling powers of organic and integrated self-development and ontoge\u00ad nesis and would never succumb to the temp\u00ad tation of seeing it as \"just a bag of cells.\" It is an organism at the early stage of develop\u00ad ment\u2014but that still leaves open the precise moral standing that it should command among us, and I have never said that the embryo is a person or its equivalent. I have said that one need not believe that an early human embryo is fully one of us to be troubled by the idea and practice of regarding it as mere raw material for our own, albeit humanely inspired, use. That dis\u00ad quiet concerns less what we do to embryos than what we do to ourselves. As a policy matter, I do oppose all human cloning, including the creation of cloned embryos for research but not for the reason you have ascribed to me. I thought, for the future, you would like to have this error corrected. Leon Kass Washington, D.C. Ironically, I share with Paul Kurtz many of the same personal values (\"Can the Sciences Help Us to Make Wise Ethical Judgments?\" September/October 2004). I am nonrcli- gious but work at being moral and ethical. It would be reassuring if we could find a scien\u00ad tific basis promoting good behavior. Unfortunately, Kurtz's attempt fails, because he falls (as so many have before him) into relying on circular reasoning. Kurtz dismisses \"objective relativism\" because of its \"dire consequences\" as when it SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January/February 2005 63 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR was applied in Nazi Germany. He then asserts, \"scientific knowledge has a vital... role to play in shaping our moral values . . . surely more than our current reliance on theologians, politicians, military pundits, corporate CEOs, and celebrities!\" Both statements are presumptuous. The first assumes that the slaughter of millions of innocent people is a bad thing. While 1 per\u00ad sonally agree that this is a bad thing, that's my adopted stance. It is not proof that our shared desire is intrinsic to nature, which does, after all, waste millions of sperm in order to gain a single pregnancy. So, Kurtz has already selected at least two outcomes he desires\u2014a value system that condemns the slaughter of innocent people and a sys\u00ad tem that does not rely on people with whom he often disagrees. (And darned if I don't hold those same values, myself.) Then he proposes a \"naturalistic ethics\" which would be open to rational inquiry, where we would select those ethical and moral val\u00ad ues that work, discarding those that don't. He claims we have a body of \"prescriptive ethical judgments\" to go by. But who exactly has agreed upon these values? To use one of his examples, is it okay to execute an evil person if it deters other evildoers but not if it doesn't? Why? Doesn't this presup\u00ad pose that deterrence is good but retribution is not? Who says so? In fact, revenge has survived thousands of years of human his\u00ad tory. Objectively, as a persistent value, per\u00ad haps we should assume revenge is \"good.\" Finally, he (surprise) discovers that the sys\u00ad tem he has chosen supports the values he has adopted for himself. So, who selected this \"valuational base,\" packed with \"de facto values and principles\"? Why, it was people with whom he agrees! Who would have guessed it?! Years ago, in a college ethics class, I was chastised by a philosophy professor because of my answer to the question: \"What do many of these different ethical systems have in common?\" My answer: \"They were all designed by people to be guided by princi\u00ad ples chosen by people very much like them\u00ad selves.\" So frankly, my personal favorite is Mammy Yokum, who stated it better, in far fewer words: \"Goodness is better than bad\u00ad ness, 'cause it's nicer.\" John dinger Richmond, Virginia From Paul Kurtz's article. I learned that peo\u00ad ple who disagree with Kurtz always put die words immoral and debauchery in quotes, apparendy to indicate thai they are in error. They also put ensoulment in quotes, because they know there is no such thing. And peo\u00ad ple who disagree with Kurtz don't believe or determine anything: they recoil in horror, propose ethics of revulsion, and actively wish to abandon both reason and freedom. Really, how childish. Kurtz's entire piece can be paraphrased in a sentence: We shouldn'i underestimate the fact-based component of moral decisions, which nonetheless have a value-based component beyond the realm of science. Is Kurtz so removed from a world where intelligent, reflective people support the death penalty or oppose euthanasia that he thinks \"getting the facts straight\" is a shocking concept? Most Christians, conservatives, and Republicans would not be startled or \"recoil in horror\" at the self-evident point that one must get the fact-based components straight when making moral decisions. They would reasonably recoil in horror, though, at Kurtz's unhidden arrogance, childish use of scare quotes, and weak attempt at straw-man persuasion tactics. Tim Fite Richmond, Virginia Paul Kurtz states in his article on ethical judgements, \"active euthanasia ... (as prac\u00ad ticed in Oregon and the Netherlands).\" What we allow here in Oregon is in no way euthanasia. It is hardly even assisted suicide. After independent doctors certify that a ter\u00ad minal patient will die within six months, the patient may request (if competent) a pre\u00ad scription which his physician writes but does not provide or administer. The patient must independently obtain and take it. What we allow is nothing like what can happen in the Netherlands. P.M. deLaubenfels Corvallis, Oregon Paul Kurtz responds: I appreciate the clarification that Leon Kass has made of his position. Many opponents of cloning, especially stem-cell research, do object to it on precisely the grounds that I have sug\u00ad gested. It is good to hear that Dr. Kass does not accept the doctrine of 'ensoulment,\" an extra- scientific concept based on theological faith by those who consider the embryo a person. As head of the Presidential Council on Bioethics. he has played a powerful role and he admits that he does \"oppose all human cloning, including the creation of cloned embryos for research.\" In his book Life, Liberty and the Defense of Dignity: The Challenge for Bioethics (Encounter Books, 2002), he implies a \"spiritual dimension\" to his opposition. \"Life and soul\" he states, \"are incredibly mysterious \" (p. 296). In any case, I find the opposition to embryonic stem-cell research regrettable, since it overlooks the possible benefits that may ensue. John Clinger is mistaken in saying that I oppose \"objective relativism.\" / do not\u2014only subjective relativism. I reiterate that science can have a vital role to play in shaping our values, though these are relative to our interests. Is the opposition to the slaughter of millions of inno\u00ad cent people simply a question of subjective taste, as he seems to imply! Surely the slaughter of innocent people is amenable to rational criti\u00ad cisms. Similarly, one can provide reasoned arguments against policies based on revenge. I have pointed out in my writings in ethics that there are relevant data to consider in moral dilemmas, such as the common moral decencies, shared needs and values, and an appreciation for human rights and responsibilities. Thus, I submit that there are normative principles that are widely recognized that we can draw upon. Apparently Tom Fite believes that a \"value- based component\" is entirely \"beyond the realm of science.\" \"The gentleman doth protest too much, methinks!\" If he reads my article care\u00ad fully, he will recognize that I share with him the need for some skepticism about moral inquiry based on science. But this is not total skepticism, which borders on nihilism. The field of medical ethics perhaps best illus\u00ad trates the development of normative principles in treating terminal patients and allowing them (in consultation with their doctors) to make reflective choices. (In answer to P.M. de Laubenfels, I realize that the form of euthanasia practiced in Oregon in this regard goes beyond that allowed in the Netherlands.) Can a ratio\u00ad nal case be made for some form of euthanasia for adults, including assisted suicide? \"The right of privacy,\" \"informed consent, \"and the \"quality of life\" of the patient are relevant principles, but these should not be viewed as either absolute commandments nor subjective tastes, but are amenable to reasoned inquiry. Science, I've said, has a vital (/limited, role to play in shaping our moral values. To quote from my article, \"We ought to consider our moral principles and values, like other beliefs, open to examination in the light of evidence and reason and, hence, amenable to modifi\u00ad cation. \" / have suggested some additional crite\u00ad ria we use in evaluating ethical judgments: are our values reliable?, how do they compare with others we hold?, are they consistent?, and, have they been tested in practice? In any case, I am suggesting that the methods of inquiry we use in other areas of human knowledge should be 64 lanuary/February 2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER LETTERS TO THE EDITOR applied, however modestly, to the area of ethics. We especially need some degree of skepticism as a necessary antidote to all forms of moral dog\u00ad matism\u2014including our own. Popper and Evolution Thanks to Massimo Pigliucci for the good article (\"Did Popper Refute Evolution?\" September/October 2004), Although Pigli\u00ad ucci tells us nothing substantially new, clear expositions like this are always most welcome. One can show that the line of argument leading to the neo-Darwinian theory (prop\u00ad erly framed) is formally valid and, moreover, sound. In addition, if the premise of chal\u00ad lenge to reproductive success (Darwin's \"struggle for life\") is disjoined from the premise of natural selection, as logically it should be, all possible circularity disappears. Finally, since the neo-Darwinian theory is fundamentally a theory of adaptation, it is obviously testable (as Pigliucci points out) in terms of the predicted spread of adaptations (i.e., specific features of individuals within a species) via (inclusive) differential reproduc\u00ad tive success (natural selection) under the \"struggle for life.\" I once had the good fortune to discuss certain matters of evolutionary theory with Sir Karl Popper, face to face. My impression was of a man of such remarkable intellectual integrity that a well-considered change of mind would be simply a matter of course. Frederick Cichocki Boca Raton, Florida It Would Have Been Clearer In his review of die movie What the US'! Do We Know? (September/October 2004), Eric Scerri correctly notes diat the moviemakers err in supposing that, because macroscopic biological systems ultimately consist of quan\u00ad tized elementary particles, the behaviors of die former must simply and direcdy recapit\u00ad ulate diose of die latter. However, he incor\u00ad rectly identifies dieir error as an example of reductionism, rather than as one of inaccu\u00ad rate analogy and foolish oversimplification. His statements that \"reductionism works in principle but not in practice\" and is an \"old-fashioned paradigm that. . . everything is indeed nothing but physics,\" aldiough perhaps technically true, are pejorative in connotation. He should have explained more clearly that (as best we know now) chemistry and biology can be reduced to physics, but diat to do so all the time would be needlessly, often impossibly, tedious. Similarly one does not prove all the theorems of mathematics using only the axioms and postulates, but as much as possible, one uses other, previously established, results. John G.
