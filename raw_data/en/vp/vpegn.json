Mass cancellations hit hospitals and the hospitality industry catering to foreign patients. The recovery though slow is promising. Some light is visible at the end of the tunnel. Countries that managed to flatten the [Covid](https://drprem.com/wellness/wellness-tourism-news-updates-and-trends-in-covid-19-crisis/) curve are slowly opening borders for foreign medical travelers. Post global economic crisis, employment in tourism and hospitality was the highest about 35% while other sectors grew by 11%. Tourism has been the major employment provider for the vulnerable sections namely the youth and women. Despite the scary number of millions of job losses in this sector, it has the ability to bounce back faster than others. Amid this situation, it is more important for stakeholders to follow the principles of UNTWO Global Code of ethics for tourism. The UNTWO has released a call for action to mitigate this devastating impact on socio-economic sector and accelerate the growth by taking effective steps in crisis management and mitigating the impact, providing stimulus to speed up the recovery and proactive planning for the future. Here we bring you some significant industry updates highlighting the possible future medical tourism trends and hidden opportunities. 22/07/21 International medical travel shows good signs of rebound almost to that of pre-pandemic levels Massive cancellation of elective and non-elective procedures due to restricted travel in pandemic has created a huge pent-up demand. As borders loosen their restrictions, medical travel is quick to rebound. As put by the Chief Operating Officer of Medical Departures, the US traffic of international medical travel has picked up almost the same as of pre-pandemic levels shooting up the dollar earnings by 20-50%. And this is mostly by those who have deferred treatments. Driving past the borders by car is the most opted route for medical travel considering this mode of travel as one of the safest one. Major medical procedures mostly are pricey in the US where healthcare coverage is not enough to cover the expenses. With vaccinations giving hopes for reduced infection rates, we are likely to see a faster growth in medical tourism. 28/10/20 Penang eyes tech solutions to boost medical tourism Image Source : buletinmutiara.com [Penang](https://drprem.com/medical-tourism/medical-tourism-in-penang-malaysia-rides-on-affordability-and-pleasant-vacation), one of the affordable and pleasurable medical tourism destinations is considering technology solutions like robotics, IOT, and improved data system to increase destination attractiveness in medical tourism.

The International Patients Center (IPC) of PHKL was flooded with calls from international patients after Malaysia opened its borders from July 1. Most of the enquiries were from new patients looking for various treatments in oncology, pediatric, neurosurgery, cardiology, orthopedic and gastroenterology treatments. However, Malaysia allowed only critical patients of cancer and neurosurgery and pediatric giving top priority to the safety of patients and healthcare providers amid the Covid spike.

Private hospitals in medical tourism hotspots are seeing emergency cases from abroad in very restricted numbers. India received 6, 97,000 foreign patients on medical visa in 2019. In the midst of Covid-19 pandemic, the country is very cautious in issuing medical visas considering only the most critical cases in spine surgery, kidney diseases or stroke rehab. Patients needing emergency care are flown in India either through special air ambulance or chartered flights. In some cases, the quarantine period has to be cut down to hurried surgeries as delaying could risk the patient's life. 08/10/20 Thailand to allow more medical tourists by allowing direct flights to Chiang Mai, Samui, Phuket, and U-Tapao airports To push the medical tourism recovery, Thailand's Medical Hub Board will table the proposal to allow direct international flights to chief [spa resort](https://drprem.com/wellness/spa-hotels-resorts-becoming-vital-wellness-destinations/) districts and quarantine locations to facilitate further inflow of medical tourists through Special Tourist Visa (STV).

Tightened border control forces Malayasia cut medical tourism targets Increasing local Covid-19 outbreaks and tracing overseas visitors have forced Malaysia to revisit [medical tourism targets](https://drprem.com/medical-tourism/medical-tourism-target-marketing-minimizing-efforts-with-maximum-impact). Recent Covid-19 resurgences around the world have forced Malaysia to tighten its borders with medical tourism hitting another roadblock. The country expects 800 million ringgit earning ($194 million) from medical tourism next year against 500 million ringgit this year, which is far from 1.7 billion ringgit earned in 2019 and the set target of 2 billion ringgit in 2020.

The numbers include all overseas patients like those from other parts of the UAE, Gulf citizens, expatriates from the gulf and other countries. The exact numbers implying the number of tourists flying to Dubai for treatments is unknown. Comparing figures of Dubai with that of other countries would not be fair enough as people coming from different states of the UAE and expatriates working are also counted which is not done in other medical tourism destinations. However, [Dubai aims 500,000 medical tourists](https://drprem.com/medical-tourism/how-strategic-development-is-helping-dubai-medical-tourism-to-meet-the-target-of-500000-medical-travelers) by 2021, 50% from the UAE itself and the rest from other countries. 19/09/20 Scientists evaluate medical tourism prospects in Russia Scientists from the Sechenov University in an interview with the Russian healthcare experts assessed medical tourism prospects in the country. [Russian medical tourism](https://drprem.com/medical-tourism/russian-economy-is-shaping-medical-tourism-like-a-pro) is in the preliminary stages. It was just in 2018 that the state head Vladimir Putin took interest in this matter. The interview was focused on market growth impediments and essential measures to attract foreign patients. Heads of 36 medical organizations taking part in the survey dug out three important problems. One, low awareness of foreigners about medical services in Russia, two, lack of competent doctors and specialists conversant in foreign languages and three, resource crunch. Problems in accommodation and documentation for visa processing add to the impediments. However, a majority of the experts agreed problems in personnel and equipment need to be addressed first. [Geographical proximity](https://drprem.com/medical-tourism/understanding-cultural-issues-related-medical-tourism) to the CIS countries, low cost of healthcare services, well-equipped clinics and qualified specialists pose competitive advantages for Russian healthcare. The prime objective as of now to go for organized development of medical tourism according to experts. 16/09/20 Trickled flow of foreign patients in Ahmedabad hospital shows signs of medical tourism revival in India After 6 months of lull finally, Ahmedabad is welcoming foreign medical patients in very low numbers. The HCG hospital treated its first international patient in the last six months, a 57-year old Tanzanian female who underwent a knee replacement surgery. Ahmedabad is a popular medical tourism hub in India with large corporate hospitals attending foreign patients in bulk. But owing to the Covid-19, all the hospitals are passing through a lull phase one of the longest in recent times. The HCG Hospital alone handles about 500 overseas patients annually but the number has been below double digits this year. [Medical tourism in India](https://drprem.com/medical-tourism/top-reasons-for-the-booming-medical-tourism-industry-in-india) has resumed at a very slow pace as very few international flights are in operation. Procuring a medical visa these days has been an uphill task unless the patient's case is duly supported by official letters. 15/09/20 GCC hailed as the 'medical tourism capital' of the world Medical tourism in the GCC region has been through an interesting developmental phase finally emerging as the 'medical tourism capital' of the world. In the latest medical tourism index rankings, all the member countries have received higher rankings making GCC region the global medical tourism hub. According to the Medical Tourism Association, the [UAE stands first](https://drprem.com/medical-tourism/medical-tourism-in-uae) in the GCC region medical tourism rankings followed by Oman in the 2nd and Bahrain in the 3rd position. Both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait received 4th and 6th rank respectively. According to the judges, Dubai received accolades for its comprehensive system and Oman for its \"high quality healthcare destination\". [Bahrain](https://drprem.com/medical-tourism/bahrain-to-develop-strategic-medical-tourism) was appreciated for several reasons - higher number of annual visits and the 2.5 km long King Fahd Causeway connection to Saudi Arabia. Bahrain's development in specialized healthcare especially in cardiology and oncology has tremendous growth opportunities supported by prominent healthcare institutions namely the Royal College of Surgeons and the upcoming US$270 million King Abdulla Medical City. Global medical tourism expenditure for GCC countries on foreign treatments for its citizens is over $2bn annually which has created a high demand for top class local medical facilities to support its own citizens and medical tourists alike. Penang medical tourism rethinks of entry ban Medical service providers of Penang are requesting the Malaysian government to rethink of the blanket ban on medical tourists from high-risk countries. This move has been a big blow to the country's fast-growing medical tourism industry. Initially, the country announced the entry ban for long term visitors from Indonesia, India and Philippines which got extended to other countries having more than 150,000 Covid-19 infections. All these countries falling under the travel ban contribute to 60% of annual medical tourism sales. The government's hopes to attract 2 million medical tourists through the campaign Malaysia Year of Healthcare Travel nosedived by the Covid-induced travel restrictions. [Penang medical tourism](https://drprem.com/medical-tourism/medical-tourism-in-penang-malaysia-rides-on-affordability-and-pleasant-vacation) providers feel a reconsideration of travel bans and come up with a sustainable solution to handle the crisis. It has been an accepted fact that the world will have to live with the virus and there is a need for smart strategies to allow medical tourists without risking anybody's health. Enforcing strict quarantine and Covid-19 testing could be a better alternative to blanket ban. There is also a need to look for other low-risk source markets instead of relying on existing ones. 14/09/20 Thailand's tourism revenue to see a massive dip, 'travel bubbles' could be decisive Thailand's tourism revenue this year will decrease by 70% as estimated by Krungthai COMPASS with expected earnings to touch only 900 billion Baht compared to 3 trillion baht in the pre-pandemic era. The year 2021 will perform little better with estimated revenue of 1.2 trillion baht which is still 59% below the usual earning before the pandemic. It also predicts a major drop in international tourist visits from 900,000 to as many as 14 million. Creating travel bubbles with low-risk countries or reopening of tourist islands like [Phuket](https://drprem.com/medical-tourism/phuket-continues-with-its-stronghold-on-medical-tourism) or Samui with separate airports allowing selected long-term could create green shoots of revival in medical and other niche tourisms. Kuwait's Covid-19 move to ban 32 countries leads to opportunity loss Nationals of thirty two countries banned from [traveling to Kuwait](https://drprem.com/travel/kuwait-historical-places-top-10-historical-places-kuwait-takes/) in Covid-19 pandemic might prove to be costly for the country that is trying to turn the economic wheel faster in various sectors especially in tourism. Neighboring countries did not waste any time to attract travelers from these countries through various tourism promotional offers even providing them the required medical examination. Although Kuwait authorities had earlier gone for a special study to revive certain activities factoring in all health requirements but it was not adopted. On the other hand, various health sources report, ICU covid-19 cases have decreased along with a drop in the occupancy rates in the private hospitals. 12/09/20 Kenyatta University Teaching and Referral and Research Hospital (KUTRH) specified to be the region's medical tourism hub Image Source : africaincmag.com The newly launched hospital by President Kenyatta on September 10 is proposed to be the [medical tourism hub](https://drprem.com/medical-tourism/kenya-bagged-global-medical-tourism-award) of the region by providing quality healthcare.

The President hopes, as travel restrictions get lifted this hospital would serve both local patients and those from other countries who would like to avail quality healthcare and at the same time enjoy Kenya's tourism attractions. Malaysia resumes medical travel, aims a travel bubble Image Source : mhtc.org Medical tourism in Malaysia is set to resume after managing Covid-19 relatively better than its peers. The Malaysian Healthcare Travel Council (MHTC), the country's leading authority in medical tourism is considering proposals to allow patients from selected countries to arrive by commercial flights via green zones after receiving the clearance and nod to travel from their respective governments. Six countries namely Brunei, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand have been identified as the \"green zone\" according to Ms Sherene Azli, the CEO of MHTC. Although medical tourism activities have started in Malaysia but in very small numbers far from the pre-Covid days according to the senior resident medical officer of Pantai Hospital Kuala Lumpur's (PHKL) Emergency department. Israel's medical tourism gets a boost with the UAE deal Israel is set to receive an influx of medical tourists from the UAE after a deal with a huge Emirati investment fund APEX National Investment where both sides agreed in joint promotion of healthcare technologies in the UAE and Gulf region. The Sheba Medical Center could be a prominent [medical tourism destination](https://drprem.com/medical-tourism/israels-shows-potential-for-medical-tourism) for patients from the UAE and the gulf region owing to its geographical proximity and predominance of Arab speaking staff. The signing of the MoU is significant as it reflects the first cooperative step from both sides as they agreed to look forward to better relations last month. The final signing of the agreement will be around September 21 in the UAE in a special ceremony attended by the UAE's health minister and members of the royal family. The director of Sheba's international division sounded optimistic of significant inflow of UAE medical tourists with further travel relaxations as patients would prefer Israel to the US or UK for complicated treatments. 11/09/20 Mexico seeing medical tourists from Texas border amid Coronavirus Despite the pandemic, it is again the affordability factor playing in favor of [medical tourism in Mexico.](https://drprem.com/medical-tourism/medical-tourism-in-mexico) Latino families from the Rio Grande Valley lacking heath insurance and resources are unhesitatingly crossing the border for affordable clinic visits, medicine and even for some life-saving treatments. In the process, people are contacting Covid-19 infections but that seems lesser serious to them compared to other non-Covid conditions calling for immediate medical attention. In Texas, if a doctor consultation without healthcare insurance cost up to $100, the same in Mexico would cost $25 plus the medicines are also cheaper. More than one-third of the population in Rio Grande valley and other places are without health insurance. With few hospitals to care for the chronic diabetes and hypertension patients coupled with fast depleting financial resources owing to the pandemic, the residents are left with no option but to take the route of medical tourism amid border restrictions. Hong Kong mulls forming travel bubble with 11 countries High level talks are on in the Hong Kong government as the country plans to reopen borders with 11 countries through a travel bubble. Any national entering the country with the travel bubble would have to take Covid-19 test from both ends of the trip.

DHA plans to reach out to [medical tourism facilitators](https://drprem.com/medical-tourism/about-medical-tourism-facilitators), top healthcare facilities and insurance companies to tap their potential for attracting medical tourists with due assessment of challenges and opportunities in the market. India-Maldives to run three flights per week The air travel bubble between India and [Maldives](https://drprem.com/travel/maldives-travel-places-travel-sites-top-10-tourist-destinations-maldives-pleasant-leisure/) formed last month allowing only one flight has now increased to 3 flights per week. Now there will be 3 flights are operational between Kochi and Male flying on Thursdays and Sundays. In the initial air travel bubble, only one Air India flight has been operational. This latest travel bubble is introduced by IndiGo which is expected to be hassle-free for fliers. India is a prime tourism market for Maldives while the former gets a considerable number of medical travelers from the latter. This latest move will further strengthen the relationship between two countries. Till September 9, tourists to Maldives need not have to take any test or stay quarantined if they are asymptomatic, but from September 10 tourists and short-time visitors have to produce negative RT-PCR test result done 72 hours prior to travel. 28/08/20 Long waiting times drive Canadians towards south for surgery [Florida,](https://drprem.com/travel/top-tourist-spots-in-florida-best-places-best-tourist-attractions-visit-in-florida-usa/) renowned for palm beaches and Disney parks is growing in medical tourism. Many Canadians weary of long waiting times are visiting this southern state for essential life-saving surgeries. Such is the demand that the number of Canadian medical travelers in Florida grew astoundingly by 800% in the last decade. The sunny state is set to spend $5 million in the coming year to make the best of this opportunity by offering more specialized procedures. [The wait list for Canadian patients](https://drprem.com/medical-tourism/unprecedented-healthcare-wait-times-spiraling-outbound-medical-tourism-in-canada) back home is worsening according to a recent data released in Alberta this week. Lung cancer patients are in the queue twice as long as other patients for surgery. 90% of these lung cancer patients could get their surgery done within 85 days. The Alberta health Services website shows the wait time line which is 46 week for neck surgeries which has increased more than 6 weeks as in the last year. A report from the Fraser Institute shows the waiting times for surgery and other treatments in Canada rose by an average of 18.2 weeks last year from 17.7 weeks in the previous year. Comparing the waiting times between 1993 and 2013, it has become 95% longer in 2013. Although Canadian Medicare is purposed to provide care to everybody, but when it comes to timely treatment, it is a big thorn in the flesh. Nearly 42,000 Canadians sought for beyond the border medical treatment since their cases are treated as non-urgent, and their pain and sufferings do not count in the public healthcare delivery system. In some instances, Alberta doctors are flying to Turks and Caicos with their patients to get the surgery done soon. While these facts and figures are yet to influence the Canadian health policy makers, medical tourism in Florida will continue to shine. Thailand to allow more foreign patients eases Covid-19 norms Responding to the hospitals' appeal for easier treatment access to foreign patients, Thailand plans to ease Coronavirus norms to help medical facilities get into their recovery track faster. Thailand, a global hub for medical tourism that welcomed 632,000 medical tourists last year has seen a spurt in demand for medical services by foreigners with the lifting of travel bans. Restricting the allowance of foreign patients in the 1st phase of reopening, Thailand plans to add 100 more clinics and hospitals for treating foreign patients.

Dr Anna Weegen - DeutschMedic GmbH, Director stated, \"Our first responsibility is the safety of our patients. Numerous political decisions have been done in Germany. All employees at our hospitals are well trained in accordance with the recommendations of the Robert Koch Institute - to protect patients and a staff of the hospitals. The German Federal Ministry of Health called on all hospitals in March, to shift all medical procedures. Two months later, from May onwards, surgical interventions in German Critical care hospitals are gradually reinstated. Now the question, how have patients requests changed? Yes, there are fewer requests because people know that regular flights to our country are not possible yet. But we have requests for orthopedic surgeries, medical check-ups and other activities that can be planned for a long period of time. The most important thing I want to say to our partners. For all urgent cases, which are mainly cancer patients, entry into Germany is possible, with a confirmation from a clinic. The patient does not need to be tested for the corona-virus at home. This test will be carried out in Germany. The patient remains in isolation until the test is answered. That's about a few hours. Now it is necessary to be 14 days in the clinic without going out of such quarantine. What solutions for rehabilitation after coronavirus infection did you find for your patients? The occupancy rate in rehabilitation facilities is increasing. After coronavirus infection, an air resort involves air treatment as a form of climate therapy.

There are air resorts in the mountains, forests and at the sea coast of Germany.

Countries with telemedicine infrastructure can support international patients. It can help in motivating patients to travel. Assurance of strict prevention measures for the patient and the families would be the key factor to boost medical tourism. Physicians will travel less as they would be busy in clearing backlogs of cancelled surgeries and treatments. Canadians may like to travel provided they get the assurance of safety and access to information and the destination takes full care if infected with Covid.
