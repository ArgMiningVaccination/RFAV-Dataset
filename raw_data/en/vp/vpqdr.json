Low adverse event reporting suggests there may be more than 100,000 adverse vaccine reactions yearly. Statistics suggest the number of permanent disabilities is several times the number of deaths. 1 in 175 children who completed the DPT series suffered \"severe reactions.\" 1 in 300 had seizures. The long term adverse effects of vaccine include autism, hyperactivity, ADD, dyslexia, allergies, cancer and many other conditions that barely existed before the vaccination programs began. Harris Coulter, Ph.D. (medical historian) revealed childhood immunizations to be \"causing a low- grade encephalitis in about 15-20% of all infants.\" A study in the Lancet reported that Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis were far more prevalent in vaccinated individuals than non-vaccinated ones. In 1986, Congress passed a law to compensate people seriously injured by vaccines. By March, 1995 the fund paid out more than $522 Million for vaccine injuries and deaths. By 1997, more than $750 Million had been awarded to more than 1000 victims. The compensation program has received over 5000 petitions since 1988, including over 700 for vaccine related deaths. Before You Vaccinate - Ask 8 Questions: Is my child sick right now? Has my child already had a bad reaction to a vaccination? Does my child have a history of convulsive/neurological disorders, severe allergies, or immune system disorders? Do I know if my child is at high risk of reacting? Do I have full information on the vaccine's side effects? Do I know how to identify a vaccine reaction? Do I know how to report a vaccine reaction? What is the vaccine manufacturer's name & lot number? Make informed vaccination decisions. Call the National Vaccine Information "}
