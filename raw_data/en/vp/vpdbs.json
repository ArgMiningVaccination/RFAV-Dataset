Suppose you have a really crummy day at school. You get home ready to yell at the dog or pick a fight with your little sister. But then you open the door and smell chocolate chip cookies baking in the oven. Right away, the day feels a lot better, doesn't it? That shows you the power of aromatherapy. The fact is, certain kinds of smells can make us feel better in many different ways. Just as baking cookies can make you feel warm and cozy, some smells can make you feel sleepy, calm, or just plain healthier. In Clinical Aromatherapy, your coach will help you find the exact kinds of smells that can help with what- ever problems you may have\u2014nausea, headaches, fatigue and nervousness. How does it work? Don't expect your aromatherapy coach to bake cookies for you! Instead, he or she will use essential oils to help you with your body's problems. These oils come from plants, like lavender, chamomile and orange, and have a very strong smell. In Clinical Aromatherapy, you think of your nose and your skin as the doorway to the rest of your body. The smell of the essential oil travels through those doorways to wherever it needs to go, whether it's your brain (to help with headaches, nervous feelings or paying attention in school), your stomach (to help with stomachaches) or your muscles (to help with aches and pains). Mixing it up. Just as every body is different, so is every aromatherapy treatment. Some kids may find that a certain essential oil really works for their headaches; other kids may find that a different oil works instead. Your coach will give you many different smells to try out for whatever your body needs. You might also combine your aromatherapy treatments with other medicines and therapies like massage. If you decide to try Clinical Aromatherapy, you just need to remember two things. First, keep trying different essential oils until you find what works best for you. And second, let your nose do the work. Don't ever drink an essential oil!
