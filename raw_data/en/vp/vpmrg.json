None of the information is meant to take the place of your health care provider's advice or medical treatment. Introduction What if I told you there was a way to help heal your body, mind, and spirit that didn't involve doctors, drugs or even spiritual gurus? On top of that, what if I said that this method of healing costs nothing and really doesn't demand much of your day? Stay with me now. I know you're ready to roll your eyes and say, Really? My response to that is, Really! Absolutely. Without a doubt. Healing meditation asks nothing more of you than sitting for approximately 20 minutes a day in silence or visualizing your health. Nothing more. Well, if you've ever tried meditation, you may believe that's quite a chunk of time to sit doing nothing. Then again, if you've attempted meditation and found it beneficial in any way, you know these 20 minutes are well worth the investment - even if you've only used it to renew your energy, refuel your goals or simply release stress. Here, though, I must add a caveat. Don't use this form of meditation in place of your doctor's advice, conventional medicine or any other form of treatment\u2014at least not at first. As you read through this book, you'll learn the simply astounding results to not only your emotional well-being, but your mental outlook as well as your physical health. Before you embark on this health journey, discuss your intentions with your physician. He'll no doubt encourage you. The advantage to this is that when the biomarkers of your particular health problems improve, he'll have some idea why. If you don't do this, he may very well credit any medication you've been taking that up until this point that may not have even worked very well. The History of Healing Meditation To truly understand why healing meditation is considered so remarkable by many, you first need to understand the history not only of meditation, but more importantly of Western medicine itself. In the Western world - Western Europe as well as North America - the typical view of treatment of disease is something that is done to the body. Physicians, for many years, saw themselves as dispensers of chemicals which stimulated the body's healing from outside itself. Eastern medical systems such as Chinese Traditional Medicine and the Indian Ayurvedic system perceive healing as springing from within the body itself if given the proper conditions. No external, artificial stimulation is needed. It's not surprising then that many Eastern traditions, if not all of them, support various forms of meditation, including the healing varieties, while Western medicine has looked askance at it. That is, until recently. The conventional medical community has finally taken the effort to investigate objectively the effects of healing on not only the mind and body, but also the physical body as well. As a result of this newfound open-mindedness, these intrepid investigators are also realizing another aspect of the body. At one time, many mainstream scientists believed in a split between the mind and body. The two, they believed, were two separate entities. It made little difference that the mind was contained in the body. That's why physicians treated the body as they did in times of ill health. Recently though - within the last generation - this view is changing. More and more physicians see the evidence that the mind holds an amazing power over the body. This power is capable not only of healing, but also of influencing the body in many other ways as well. Western medicine now understands - better than it ever has before - that the mind plays a vital role in mental, emotional, and physical functions. Believe it or not, this is a seismic shift for the conventional medical community. We're all learning - you and I included - by extension the full effects the mind exerts on our bodies. Most of us are slowly taking down that artificial veil that separated our bodies from our minds. We're learning through experience that if you change your method of thinking, you can potentially change the direction of your life. By extension, changes in your thinking can also trigger changes in your health - physical, emotional and mental. This is the goal of healing meditation. As with all meditation, you dwell in the moment. In this moment, you affirm that your body is whole, your thoughts are of wellness, and your emotions are void of all stress (or as some call it, artificial stress). Why am I so Confident in this Process? I know that meditation can work for you if you just give it half a chance. What makes me so confident? I've seen it work miracles in my own life. Several years ago, I was faced with a serious illness. While I had been meditating occasionally, I increased the amount of time I devoted to this practice and immediately began visualizing a whole and healthy body. My surgery was successful, my follow-up treatment equally successful, and today I'm feeling better than I ever have before. My friends are amazed at my recovery, but even more, they were astonished at the positive attitude I maintained throughout the entire journey. The doctors and nurses who treated me were also impressed with the speed of my recovery as well as my attitude. Soon, friends were asking me how I managed it all. When I told them of my meditation routine, they wanted to know more. That got me thinking: there might be more individuals faced with physical, emotional or mental issues who could benefit from meditation, but don't know how or where to start. If you feel that something isn't quite right in your life, then perhaps you should look at what the practice of healing meditation can do for you. You may be facing a major physical health issue as I was. Perhaps you're barraged with stress on steroids, as many of us are these days. Or it could be any health issue in between. Meditation has even been known to help youth with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. If healing meditation works for all of these issues, then it certainly can help you cope with - and even heal - what's askew in your life. The "}
