ABOUT THIS PROGRAM A Weekly Class (4 Sessions) Thursday, March 11 - April 1, 2021, 6:30 - 9:30 pm ET Chinese, Tibetan and Ayurvedic medical traditions are rich repositories not only of ethnobotanical knowledge for healing the body but also of these ancient cultures' spiritual practices and mystical insights. Along with the lineages of yogic and meditative disciplines, classical Asian medicine explored and recorded the subtle energetic systems that lie between the body, mind and spirit. By cultivating these energetic systems in the body, we can develop an awareness of our unity with nature and our true spiritual identity. One way to do this is by combining the use of medicinal plants with meditation to deepen our knowledge of these subtle energies and how they connect us with the cosmos as well as to better understand the energies/elements within different medicinal plants. In this 4-week class we'll discover a range of highly effective and easy-to-learn teachings and practices that will introduce us to a complete system of plant medicine, meditation and mysticism drawn from these cultures, one that can help us connect to the spiritual dimensions of the body and stabilize and center our inner self. Modules can be taken individually or together as a 4-week course for a combo price. - Module 1 - (3/11) - The Rainbow Body: Transforming Ordinary Consciousness [MORE INFO | REGISTER](https://www.opencenter.org/rainbow-body) - Module 2 - (3/18) - The Matrix of Energy: How Botanicals, Prana & Qi Bridge Consciousness - [MORE INFO | REGISTER](https://www.opencenter.org/matrix-of-energy) - Module 3 - (3/25) - The Celestial Matrix\u2014The Nutritional Nectar of Moonlight [MORE INFO | REGISTER](https://www.opencenter.org/celestial-matrix) - Module 4 - (4/1) - The Heart of the Matrix\u2014Healing the Mind, Stress, Insomnia, Anxiety & Depression - [MORE INFO | REGISTER](https://www.opencenter.org/heart-of-the-matrix) WHAT YOU'LL NEED FOR THIS COURSE - Prerequisites: N/A - Supplies list for the class: N/A - Zoom Software Requirements: This is an online course that requires Zoom webinar software.
