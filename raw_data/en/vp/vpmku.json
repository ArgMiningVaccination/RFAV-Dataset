Tri-Fortify\u00ae is backed by peer-reviewed, published clinical research. Furthermore, Tri-Fortify\u00ae overcomes the common shortcomings of other glutathione supplements. We spent two years developing our unique manufacturing process to create the best liposomal glutathione supplement. Our objectives were to: - Provide superior intracellular absorption - Create a heat-stable product that does not require refrigeration. (After subjecting Tri-Fortify\u00ae to 104\u00b0F and 75% humidity for 90 consecutive days, it still exceeded label claims) - Develop a flavor that both children and adults could enjoy by eliminating the strong sulfur smell and taste associated with other glutathione products. Ingredients - Reduced Glutathione | 450mg - Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) | 50mg Other Ingredients: Glycerin, medium-chain triglycerides, phospholipids (soy), natural flavor.
