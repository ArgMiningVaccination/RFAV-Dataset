There are various reasons why you would want to detox from marijuana. You may simply want to stop using it altogether. You may be facing a drug-screening test in the future or you may have built up a tolerance to weed. Whatever your reason, you need to accept the fact that detoxing from any substance always involves some withdrawal systems. Luckily, the withdrawal symptoms related to detoxing from marijuana are not nearly as severe (or even dangerous) as is the case when detoxing from alcohol or drugs like heroin. There's a lot of advice on ways in which to detox from marijuana but nobody promises that the process will be easy! So, when you embark upon a detox program, gird your loins and resolve to achieve your goals. Here are some [natural remedies](https://cleanandhealthyme.org/blog/marijuana-detox-drinks-pills-kits-and-natural-remedies.html) recommended by several experts. Exercise Most of the toxins that you want to flush from your system reside in your fat cells. That is why [exercise is so important when detoxing](https://cleanandhealthyme.org/blog/are-exercises-effective-for-marijuana-detox.html). When you do cardio exercises or weight training, fat cells are burned fast, helping you to detox faster. Vigorous exercise also offers an unexpected yet happy bonus! [Anandamide](https://www.nature.com/articles/4401284), the body's natural \"feel good\" enzyme with THC-like molecules is released, creating altogether another kind of high! And don't forget about all the health benefits a fitter you will enjoy. Drink Water [Drinking plenty of water will help you to get rid of the toxins](https://cleanandhealthyme.org/blog/water-detox-can-it-help-pass-drug-test.html) quicker and it will keep you hydrated. Drinking copious amounts of water is not a detox solution on its own, however. Jazzing up your water with fresh lemons, mint and even watermelon may encourage you to consume at least two liters a day. Drink Tea [Teas with high levels of anti-oxidants](https://cleanandhealthyme.org/blog/can-tea-help-detox-from-marijuana-and-pass-a-drug-test.html), such as dandelion, rooibos and [milk thistle](https://cleanandhealthyme.org/blog/does-milk-thistle-help-pass-a-drug-test.html) are not just delicious but they can play an important part in flushing toxins from the liver. Watch Your Diet Salty and fatty foods, as well as sugary treats, drinks and food all slow down your metabolism, thus slowing down the detoxification process significantly. Opt for raw vegetables and fruit and increase your fiber intake. Sweat! A lot of toxins are [released through your sweat](https://cleanandhealthyme.org/blog/does-sweating-help-detox-from-weed.html). Of course exercise will make you sweat and that is good. You can also consider a regular sauna during your detox period. This will definitely help to flush your system faster. Consider Colon Cleansing No, it's not a joke! Several experts point out that large quantities of toxins reside in the colon. Opting for colon irrigation will flush these toxins from the body. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of using a home remedy, ask a professional to perform the irrigation. Also keep in mind that you do not necessarily have to do the cleansing from \"down there.\" There are many products that are consumed orally. Your pharmacist will give you good advice. Increase Your Vitamin C Intake Vitamin C is water-soluble and is not stored in the body. This means that it is perfectly save to consume large amounts. The idea is to consume high levels of Vitamin C throughout the detox period or at least until your stool turns watery. This will protect your body from infections, boost your immune system and, most important of all, [get rid of THC](https://cleanandhealthyme.org/blog/marijuana-detox-guide.html) and other harmful toxins. Take Hot and Cold Showers As ridiculous as it may sound, alternating hot and cold showers can do much to increase your circulation, boost your metabolism and encourage your lymphatic flow. These benefits are all important in any detox program. This is how to do it: start with a sixty second burst of hot water and follow this immediately with a 30 second blast of cold water. You need to do this several times a day. Drink Apple Cider Vinegar One or two tablespoons of [apple cider vinegar](https://cleanandhealthyme.org/blog/does-apple-cider-vinegar-help-you-pass-a-drug-test.html) each day will naturally detox your urine and remove the toxins stored in your fat cells. Use Bentonite Clay Bentonite clay has many supporters that consider it the very best detoxing agent (both internally and externally). For external use, mix the clay with water and apply it to your skin (all over). After 30 minutes, take a shower. (Hey! A good time for trying that alternate hot / cold shower remedy discussed above!) Half a teaspoon of clay dissolved in water will work wonders to expel toxin inside your body. (Note: The effectiveness of Bentonite clay is greatly reduced when exposed to metal. When drinking it, use a plastic or glass container.) Dry-brush Your Skin You never thought that dry-brushing your skin would encourage the release of toxins, did you? It is true nevertheless and it is an old secret recommended by [beauty](https://cleanandhealthyme.org/blog/can-beauty-products-make-you-fail-a-drug-test.html) therapists and alternative health experts. When you brush your skin (using a reasonably firm brush) the pores are opened and toxins are released. Start from the chest outwards towards the armpits, but avoid the nipples. Next, brush your abdomen from the navel upwards towards the armpits and from the navel downward towards the groin. Complete the routine with one of those hot / cold shower sessions. Take a Hot Bath Not just a foamy bubble bath, nice as that might be, but an Epsom salt bath. The benefits of Epsom salt have been the focus of many studies. It definitely helps the body to release toxins and it eases painful muscles and provide relief from rashes and injuries too. Simply dissolve two cups of Epsom salt in a hot tub and soak for half an hour or so. What about a Herbal Detox Kit? Your pharmacist or homeopath can give you great advice on which [herbal detox kit](https://cleanandhealthyme.org/product_fast-marijuana-detox-kit-extra-strong.html) would work best for you. Most of these kits contain a combination of herbal capsules that aim to stimulate the bowels, to flush toxins from the body and to prevent the onset of withdrawal symptoms. Kits are available for either nine or fourteen day detox programs. Final Thoughts None of the remedies discussed here are quick fixes. If you are desperate to pass an upcoming drug-screening test, none of them will work. Those of you that truly want to properly detox from marijuana will definitely benefit from these home remedies. None of these remedies will nullify the benefits of any other remedy, so you can employ as many of them as you wish. "}
