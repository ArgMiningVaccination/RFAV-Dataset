Hormones are chemical messengers that have profound effects on your mental, physical, and emotional health. For instance, they play a major role in controlling your appetite, weight, and mood. Your body typically produces the precise amount of each hormone needed for various processes to keep you healthy. However, sedentary lifestyles and Western dietary patterns may affect your hormonal environment. In addition, levels of certain hormones decline with age, and some people experience a more dramatic decrease than others. A nutritious diet and other healthy lifestyle habits may help improve your hormonal health and allow you to feel and perform your best. Consuming adequate amounts of protein is extremely important. Not only does protein [provide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6770041/) Your endocrine glands make these hormones from amino acids. Peptide hormones play a crucial role in regulating many physiological processes, such as growth, energy metabolism, appetite, stress, and reproduction. For example, protein intake [influences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4424780/) Research has shown that eating protein [decreases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5278948/) [ghrelin](/nutrition/ghrelin) and [stimulates](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32648023/) One [3-month study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24923232/) Experts recommend eating a minimum of 15-30 grams of protein per meal. You can do this by including [high protein foods](/nutrition/20-delicious-high-protein-foods) such as eggs, chicken breast, lentils, or fish at each meal. Physical activity strongly influences hormonal health. Aside from improving blood flow to your muscles, exercise increases hormone receptor sensitivity, meaning that it enhances the delivery of nutrients and hormone signals. A major [benefit of exercise](/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise) is its [ability](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32342455/) Insulin is a hormone that allows cells to take up sugar from your bloodstream to use for energy. However, if you have a condition called [insulin resistance](/nutrition/insulin-and-insulin-resistance), your cells may not effectively react to insulin. This condition is a risk factor for diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. However, while some researchers still debate whether the improvements come from exercise itself or from losing weight or fat, [evidence shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8556891/) Many types of physical activity have been found to help prevent insulin resistance, including [high intensity interval training](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26479856/) also](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24704257/) [such as](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8107361/) For people who cannot perform vigorous exercise, even regular walking [may increase](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25858281/) Weight gain is directly associated with hormonal imbalances that may lead to complications in insulin sensitivity and reproductive health. Obesity is [strongly related](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29397563/) [is linked](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26627223/) [improvements](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6048953/) [reduced](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5990470/) Obesity is reduction or absence of hormone secretion from the testes or ovaries. In fact, this condition is one of the [most relevant](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30619096/) This means obesity is strongly related to lower levels of the reproductive hormone [testosterone](/nutrition/8-ways-to-boost-testosterone) in people assigned male at birth and [contributes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31391925/) Nonetheless, studies indicate that weight loss may reverse this condition. Eating [within](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28460579/) [can help](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31391925/) Your gut contains [more by modulating of rodents show](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29373083/) In addition, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) \u2014 components of certain bacteria in your gut microbiome \u2014 may increase your risk of insulin resistance. People with obesity [seem to have](https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1873-3468.14328) Here are some tips to [maintain healthy gut bacteria](/nutrition/improve-gut-bacteria) which may also help you maintain a healthy hormone balance. Minimizing added sugar intake may be instrumental in optimizing hormone function and avoiding obesity, diabetes, and other diseases. The simple sugar fructose is present in many types of sugar, comprising up to [43% of honey](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5817209/) [50% of refined table sugar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7469035/) In addition, sugar-sweetened beverages are the primary source of added sugars in the Western diet, and fructose is commonly used commercially in [soft drinks](/nutrition/13-ways-sugary-soda-is-bad-for-you), fruit juice, and sport and energy drinks. Fructose intake has increased exponentially in the United States since around 1980, and [studies consistently show](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6770027/) [promotes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26376619/) [some of which](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7774304/) been [linked to](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8301417/) What's more, fructose may fail to stimulate the production of the fullness hormone leptin, leading to decreased calorie burning and increased weight gain. Therefore, reducing your intake of sugary drinks \u2014 and other sources of [added sugar](/nutrition/too-much-sugar) \u2014 may improve hormone health. Stress harms your hormones in several ways. The hormone [cortisol](/nutrition/ways-to-lower-cortisol) is known as the stress hormone because it helps your body cope with long-term stress. Your body's response to stress activates a cascade of events that leads to cortisol production. Once the stressor has passed, the response typically ends. However, chronic stress [impairs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5334212/) Therefore, chronic stress causes cortisol levels to [remain elevated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5373497/) In addition, high cortisol levels stimulate gluconeogenesis \u2014 the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources \u2014 which may cause insulin resistance. Notably, research shows that you can lower your cortisol levels by engaging in [stress reduction techniques](/nutrition/16-ways-relieve-stress-anxiety) such as [meditation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32635830/) [yoga](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4784068/) [relaxing music](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26142566/) Try to devote at least 5 minutes per day to these activities. Including high quality natural fats in your diet may help reduce insulin resistance and appetite. [Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs)](/nutrition/mct-oil-101) are unique fats that are less likely to be stored in fat tissue and more likely to be taken up directly by your liver for immediate use as energy, promoting increased calorie burning. MCTs are also [less likely](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6140086/) Furthermore, healthy fats such as [stress](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31382171/) These oil, avocados, almonds, peanuts, macadamia nuts, hazelnuts, fatty fish, and olive and coconut oils. No matter how nutritious your diet or how consistent your exercise routine, getting enough restorative sleep is crucial for optimal health. Poor sleep is [linked to](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6196958/) [leptin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8138234/) For instance, not only does [sleep deprivation](/health/sleep-deprivation/effects-on-body) impair insulin sensitivity, but poor sleep is associated with a 24-hour [increase](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25640603/) In fact, one [small study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4399283/) Moreover, studies [consistently show](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6196958/) In a [review of](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32537891/) Plus, your brain needs uninterrupted sleep to go through all five stages of each sleep cycle. This is especially important for the [release of](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7262958/) To maintain optimal hormonal balance, aim for at least 7 hours of high quality [sleep per night](/nutrition/17-tips-to-sleep-better). [Fiber](/nutrition/why-is-fiber-good-for-you) is essential to a healthy diet. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6360548/) [increases](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25823991/) Although soluble fiber [tends to](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4757923/) Your gut microbiome ferments soluble fiber in your colon, producing SCFAs that stimulate the release of the fullness hormones PYY and GLP-1. As such, try to eat several [high fiber foods](/nutrition/22-high-fiber-foods) each day. Estrogen is a hormone [involved in](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6206851/) Like other homrones, estrogen levels that are either too low or too high have been linked to acute and chronic health conditions, including obesity, metabolic disorders, and various cancers. However, dietary choices may contribute to changes in your estrogen levels. [Research shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8489575/) [risk factor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5313342/) On the contrary, following a Mediterranean-style diet rich in whole grains, seeds, fish, legumes, and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower may help [reduce estrogen levels](/nutrition/foods-to-lower-estrogen) and, thus, cancer risk. Similarly, long-term adherence to the [Mediterranean diet](/nutrition/mediterranean-diet-meal-plan) may reduce breast cancer risk [before and after](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32682573/) [characterized by](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31008451/) Researchers believe that this diet increases your intake of protective plant compounds such as polyphenols and lignans. Your hormones are involved in every aspect of your health. You need them in very specific amounts for your body to function optimally. Hormone imbalances may increase your risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and other health conditions. Although aging and other factors that affect hormones are beyond your control, you can take several steps to help manage your hormone levels. Consuming nutritious foods, exercising regularly, and engaging in other health-promoting behaviors such as meditating and getting enough sleep may go a long way toward improving your hormonal health.
