Ayurveda means \"science of life. \" Ayurveda or Ayurvedic medicine began in India. It has been in use for over 4,000 years. It is a whole medical system, which has evolved separately from modern medicine . It considers the body in its entirety. Ayurvedic medicine was developed over many years by monks and rishis . (Rishis are poets inspired by a higher power or sages found in India). They observed how life changes due to the effects of herbs and their own diet. These observations were written into a text known as the AyurVeda. Over the last 40 years, many original texts have been translated into English . This has led to the growing popularity of Ayurvedic medicine in Western countries. Ayurvedic medicine focuses on each patient as an individual. It considers all levels of the individual : physical, social, psychological, spiritual, intellectual, behavioral, familial, and environmental. It offers natural ways to treat disease and promot e health . Ayurvedic medicine uses herbs, diet, massage, and lifestyle changes to achieve a balance between body, mind and spirit. Thus, it focuses on prevention and empowers people to take responsibility of their own health and well -being. How does Ayurvedic medicine compare to modern (allopathic) me dicine ? Modern medicine describes the body in systems. Clinicians talk about the cardiovascular system , the neurological, system, etc.). In contrast, A yurveda considers how the mind, body and spirit are connected. It is, therefore , a holistic approach. How is Ayurvedic medicine used today ? In India, 80% of the population uses it alone or along with modern medicine. In the United States , a survey done in 2007 showed that over 200,000 people had used Ayurvedic medicine in the last year. Research continu es both in India and the United States on Ayurvedic treatments. What are the main ideas behind Ayurvedic medicine ? In order to understand Ayurvedic medicine, it is important to learn about its three main ideas . These ideas have to do with universal interc onnectedness (i.e., how all things in the universe are connected), the body's constitution ( Interconnectedness. Ayurvedic practitioners think ab out relationships among people, their health, and the universe . Disease is thought to occur when a person is out of harmony (either physical, emotional or spiritual) with her/his environment. Constitution (prakriti ). Constitution refers to a person's general health, the likelihood of becoming out of balance, and the ability to resist an d recover from health problems. Each person's constitution has a unique combination of physical and psychological features. These affect the way the body functions to maintain health. Digestion and how the body deals with waste products are very important in the balance.Ayurvedic Medicine Ayurvedic Medicine PATIENT HANDOUT 2 University of Wisconsin Integrative Medicine www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative Life forces (doshas ). The prakriti includes three important life forces, or energies, called doshas. The three doshas are known by kapha . Ayurvedic medicine views the doshas in t he following ways : o Each dosha is made up of two basic elements out of the following five : 1) ether (the upper regions of space), 2) air, 3) fire, 4) water, and 5) earth. o Each dosha has a particular relationship to bodily functions and can be upset for different reasons. o Each person has a unique combination of the three doshas . One dosha , however, is usually more dominant. Doshas are constantly being formed and reformed by food, activity, and bodily processes. o Each dosha has its own physical and psychol ogical features. o An imbalance of a dosha will produce symptoms that are unique to that dosha . Imbalances may be caused by a person's age, unhealthy lifestyle or diet, too much or too little mental and physical exertion, the seasons, or inadequate protect ion from the weather, chemicals, or germs.

Gathering information and creating a plan. An Ayurvedic practitioner will ask questions about a person's diet, behavior, lif estyle, illnesses, ability to recover from illness , and physical characteri stics.

The practitioner will then use her/his knowledge of the doshas to create an individualized plan for nutrition, exercise and activities that suits that person's constitution.

Ayurvedic Medicine PATIENT HANDOUT 3 University of Wisconsin Integrative Medicine www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative Treatment goals and methods. Ayurvedic treatment goals include eliminating impurities, reducing symptoms, increasing resistance to disease, r educing worry , and increasing harmony in the patient's life. The practitioner uses a variety of methods to achieve these goals . These includ e herbal supplements, massage, oils, physical exercises, breathing exercises, and meditation. Use of plants. Ayurv edic treatments often use herbs and other plants \u2014including oils and common spices. More than 600 herbal formulas and 250 single plant drugs are included in the \"pharmacy\" of Ayurvedic treatments. Sometimes, plants are mixed with metals or other substances found in nature to make formulas . The formulas are prepared according to specific Ayurvedic procedures. How is an Ayurvedic practitioner trained ? Many practitioners study in India, where training can take five years or longer. Students who receive their Ayurvedic training in India can earn either a bachelor's degree (Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery, BAMS) or doctoral degree (Doctor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery, DAMS) . The United States has no national standard for training or certifying Ayurvedic practitioners. However, a few states have approved Ayurvedic schools as educational institutions. There are programs to become a Certified Ayurvedic Practitioner, but requirements vary greatly. What are some concerns about Ayurvedic medications ? If you are considering using Ayurvedic medication, it is good to be aware of the following concerns: Toxicity . Ayurvedic medications can be toxic (poisonous). Many have not been thoroughly studied. Also, they are not regulated as are western medication s. So, they can contain harmful ingredients. Formulations. Most Ayurvedic medications are a combination of herbs and other medicines. It is hard to know which are helpful and why they are helpful. Interactions. Whenever two or more medications are use d together, it is possible for them to interact with each other. As a result, the medications could be either less helpful or more helpful than if they were used alone. Scientific evidence. There have been few high quality studies done on Ayurvedic appro aches. Therefore, scientific evidence on Ayurvedic practices varies. More careful research is needed to determine which practices are safe and effective. The key to safe and effective treatment is to find a reliable practitioner. This specialist will guide your treatment and help identify br ands that contain the ingredients listed on their labels.
