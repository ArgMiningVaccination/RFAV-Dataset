Naturopathic physicians work with a diverse community of licensed health care providers all over the U.S. We are simply asking to give Illinois residents the same choice individuals already have in half the country.\" House Bill 3721 would create licensure and scope of practice for naturopathic physicians in Illinois.

Terra Costa Howard (D-Glen Ellyn). \"I know that many of my constituents rely on naturopathic care to help them manage chronic illness, and I am grateful for this organization's commitment to health care in our communities.\" One naturopathic client Kristina Dillard, who resides in Woodstock, IL, suffered from multiple ulcers in her mouth and eyes beginning in her late 20s. She had rashes all over her body and was chronically fatigued all the time. No one seemed to know what was wrong with her.

I couldn't go on. That was a low point for me.\" Dillard said she noticed one day that she was going blind in one eye and was desperate for a solution to her problems. She had a friend with a holistic background that urged her to see a naturopathic doctor. Her first visit with Caley Scott, ND lasted nearly two hours. Dillard was eventually diagnosed with Behcet's (beh-CHETS) disease, a rare disorder that causes blood vessel inflammation throughout the body. \"I started taking supplements, changing my diet and my vision returned and I have so much more energy now,\" Dillard said. \"I also lost 45 pounds of inflammatory weight from a prescription that worked in conjunction with my naturopathic care. I now run my own small business and I can process thoughts and information. There is no question that combining conventional medicine with a naturopathic approach is what made me better.\" Scott ND said she is fortunate to have a medical doctor who works with her to provide additional care for patients like Kristina but having the ability to provide full treatment to her patients would eliminate unnecessary hoops. \"I have a good working relationship with my medical director but that is not always the case for people in our profession,\" Scott, ND said. \"Making medical decisions that are best for the patient sometimes means using conventional medicine in tandem with naturopathic medicine. We see tremendous results with our patients because of this approach. We understand how prescriptions interact with supplements, which is a safety concern, so it is important for us to be a part of the healthcare team.\" Another client, Alan Dremann of Peoria, was diagnosed nearly 9 years ago with prostate cancer. \"I learned early on by doing a lot of research that the best results in oncology come through an integrated approach,\" Dremann said. \"I have been very fortunate to have spent the last four plus years receiving a blending of conventional and naturopathic medicine. I could go on and on about the kind of care I have received. I had severe nightly leg cramps which was disrupting my sleep. My ND recommended that I take chromium which greatly reduced the leg cramps and allowed me to get the healing rest I needed. I was sweating at night with hot flashes, and I started taking a supplement that solved that problem. I owe my life to the combination of conventional and naturopathic care I have received. This approach works because it is the right approach.\" Shelly Smekens, ND, LDN, FABNO, who has cared for Dremann said his story is not uncommon with many of the individuals with oncology needs who come to her for care. \"The best way to attack cancer is to put the human body in the best position possible to beat back the cancer,\" Smekens, ND, LDN, FABNO said. \"By working with conventional medicine, we use natural medicine to better enable our clients to fight cancer. Nutrition, diet, exercise, and mental health are all key components needed to take on cancer and win. The holistic approach we use not only is successful, but it is necessary.\" Hines ND, CNS, CPT, said passing House Bill 3721 is also about addressing physician shortages and ensuring safety. \"Ninety-eight of Illinois's 102 counties have a physician shortage,\" Hines ND, CNS, CPT, said. \"Licensing naturopathic physicians can be a part of the solution and also ensure that the people who are practicing naturopathic medicine are indeed medically trained and licensed. We can also cut costs and address a wide range of medical needs in our state by passing HB 3721 into law.\" Following is the information shown at the press conference. House Bill 3721 awaits assignment to a legislative committee. "}
