Objectives: To describe pediatric influenza vaccination in a geographically diverse sample of US pediatricians. Methods: A prospective, observational study was conducted during the 2007-2008 through 2010-2011 influenza seasons. Each season, 42, 84, 84, and 103 US outpatient pediatric offices, respectively, tracked pediatric influenza vaccinations given by age group and reported totals for each 2-week interval. Results: In 2010, by August 15 and 31, 46% and 68% of offices administered seasonal vaccines, respectively, compared with 42% and 74% of offices in 2009, 20% and 32% of offices in 2008, and 2% and 5% of offices in 2007; by September 15 and 30, 92% and 100% of offices administered seasonal vaccines in 2010, compared with 88% and 94% of offices in 2009, 58% and 79% of offices in 2008, and 43% and 67% of offices in 2007. Through September 30, 2010, the mean number of pediatric seasonal vaccinations per office was 334, compared with 464, 115, and 44 for the same time periods in 2009, 2008, and 2007. Relative to previous seasons, in 2010 the timing of initial administration of seasonal Vaccines for Children (VFC) vaccine more closely mirrored that of non-VFC vaccines. Conclusions: Measured as a percent of offices administering vaccine, early-season (pre-October) pediatric seasonal influenza vaccination has become more common since 2007 and appears to be as common in 2010 as it was in 2009. Among pediatric providers, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response appears to have increased adoption of early-season influenza vaccination and this behavior has continued in the 2010-2011 season. Data collection will continue through the end of the season. Sponsored "}
