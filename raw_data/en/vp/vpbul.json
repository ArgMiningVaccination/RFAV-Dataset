So before we get into Aroma Retail's Organic and Hypoallergenic Scents lets see what it means.", "sitename": "Aroma Retail", "date": "2019-04-17", "cleaned_text": "Safe fragrance oils that do not have toxins or volatile compounds that trigger allergic reactions are both Organic and Hypoallergenic. A lot of Essential Oils are Organic, but still, have allergens. Aroma Retail's high-quality fragrance oils, formulated specifically for aroma diffusion, are not only organic but are also hypoallergenic because the volatile organic compounds that trigger allergic reactions are distilled out while maintaining the integrity of the fragrance molecules that we actually smell. Let's break down what Organic and Hypoallergenic mean so that we can have a better understanding of this. Organic materials are defined in modern chemistry as carbon-based compounds, originally derived from living organisms (not synthetic) but now include some specific lab-synthesized versions as well. Most are combinations of a few of the lightest elements, particularly hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. In simplest terms, Organic means that the material is relating to, or derived from living organisms. Hypoallergenic means designed to reduce or minimize the possibility of an allergic response, as by containing relatively few or no potentially irritating substances, including volatile organic compounds (VOC's). Aroma Retail's products are Fragrance Oils, not Essential Oils. Essential Oils are a concentrated hydrophobic liquid that still contains volatile chemical compounds from plants. Essential oils are also known as volatile oils, ethereal oils, aetherolea, or simply as the oil of the plant from which they were extracted, such as oil of clove. Our Fragrance Oils (also known as Aroma Oils) are blended aroma compounds with natural essential oil derivatives with the allergens distilled out. These oils are also blended with a natural and neutral carrier oil to increase the usable volume and project the Aroma extracted, such as oil of clove. Fragrance Oils or Aroma Oils are blended aroma compound or natural essential oil derivative that is coupled with a carrier oil to enhance and project the Aroma making them Organic and Hypoallergenic Scents. When we smell fragrances sensing fragrance molecules, which are unique combinations of atoms that make each fragrance molecule unique. Most allergic reactions to scents are caused by plant pollen, which is a powdery substance with functions similar to a reproductive cell to create and grow other plants. Many pure Essential Oils contain pollen; our fragrance oils do not. Our Hypoallergenic Fragrance Oils extract the fragrance molecules from the natural ingredients and leave out all the allergens. Sometimes you might feel an allergic reaction to a scent with no allergens because you \"remember\" being allergic to that scent; however, no physical allergy is triggered. At Aroma Retail we sell products that are good for you, good for the environment and good for your pets. Our products use safe ingredients, which means eliminating allergens and artificial dyes, animal products, parabens, and any other potentially toxic chemicals. Our product standards are driven by our Core Values and In line with that philosophy, we only use natural organic ingredients in our fragrance oils. The outcome?
