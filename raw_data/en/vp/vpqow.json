Bee venom, however, can cause adverse effects, even rarely including life-threatening anaphylaxis, so safety-related evidence is required. In this study, we systematically estimated the incidence rate of anaphylaxis in response to BVA. Methods: We searched eight databases (MEDLINE (Pubmed), EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled, KISS, KMBASE, Koreamed, OASIS, and NDSL) and systematically reviewed the articles that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results: Among 225 potentially relevant articles, 49 were selected for this study. The overall incidence rate of anaphylaxis in response to BVA was 0.045% (95% CI 0.028-0.062). Women (0.083%, 95% CI 0.010-0.157) showed a higher incidence rate than men (0.019%, 95% CI 0.018 to 0.055), while the incidence for patients who had a skin test conducted (0.041%, 95% CI 0.011-0.072) was not significantly different compared to that obtained for patients for which there was no information about a skin test (0.047%, 95% CI 0.026-0.067). The publication year affected the incidence rate: it was highest before 1999 (1.099%, 95% CI 1.043 to 3.241), lower between 2000 and 2009 (0.049%, 95% CI 0.025-0.073), and lowest between 2010 and 2021 (0.037% 95% CI 0.014-0.060). Conclusions: In this study, we provide reference data about risk size and factors of BVA-related anaphylaxis, which is essentially required for BVA application in clinics.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-03-26", "cleaned_text": "Incidence Rate of Bee Venom Acupuncture Related Anaphylaxis: A Systematic Review [https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins14040238](https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins14040238) [Bee Venom Therapies from Basic venom acupuncture (BVA), one of the most frequently used techniques recently, involves intradermally or intramuscularly administering a small amount of refined bee venom into specific acupoints or painful areas [ [4](#B4-toxins-14-00238)]. [5](#B5-toxins-14-00238)]. Bee venom contains various enzymes, peptides, and including melittin, phospholipase A2, and apamin [ [6](#B6-toxins-14-00238)]. Among these compounds, melittin is considered to be the main active ingredient associated with the therapeutic effect of bee venom [ [7](#B7-toxins-14-00238)]. Phospholipase A2 is known to be a major allergen that can induce anaphylaxis through inflammation and hypotension [ [8](#B8-toxins-14-00238)], even though it was also recently discovered to have immunomodulatory effects [ [9](#B9-toxins-14-00238)]. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening systemic reaction, with clinical features such as lower blood pressure, blood-clotting tendency, and dyspnea; thus, it causes shock or seizures [ [10](#B10-toxins-14-00238)]. Therefore, it is very important to prevent anaphylaxis in clinics through the safe application of BVA. [11](#B11-toxins-14-00238)]. Some studies reviewing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported that BVA has a higher risk of adverse events than normal acupuncture treatment, but the limitations of small-scale studies suggest a need for further research regarding the safety of BVA [ [12](#B12-toxins-14-00238), [13](#B13-toxins-14-00238)]. Our previous cohort study estimated a 0.047% (95% CI 0.001-0.092) incidence rate of anaphylactic reactions to BVA: there were 4 cases out of 8580 patients in one hospital over a span of 10 years [ [14](#B14-toxins-14-00238)]. 2. Results 2.1. Characteristics of the Included Studies [Figure 1](#toxins-14-00238-f001)shows a flow diagram of the procedure used to select the relevant studies. The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in [Table 1](#toxins-14-00238-t001). 2.2. Incidence of Anaphylaxis in Response and 0.142% (95% 0.136 to 0.421) in RCTs. 2.3. Incidence to BVA by Subgroup [Table 2](#toxins-14-00238-t002)and 2.4. Characteristics with Anaphylaxis [Table 3](#toxins-14-00238-t003)). Nine patients showed anaphylaxis at the same concentration of bee venom, 10,000:1. Venom volume at time of anaphylaxis varied from 0.1 to 2 cc. The number of treatments until anaphylaxis reported varied from 1 to 24. Of the seven available studies, two administered bee venom intradermally and five performed an intramuscular injection. Four patients were grade IV (cardiovascular symptoms such as hypotension with/without cyanosis, collapse, arrhythmias, and angina pectoris), six patients were grade III (respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, and stridor), and the rest were unknown. Except for five cases for which treatment results were not described, twenty-two cases recovered from anaphylaxis. 3. Discussion [15](#B15-toxins-14-00238)]. In general, the incidence of mild adverse reactions to BVA, such as localized edema, pruritus, and skin rash, was reported to be 28.87% [ [16](#B16-toxins-14-00238)]. However, there were case reports of two deaths due to anaphylaxis after BVA treatment [ [17](#B17-toxins-14-00238)]. Clinical use of bee venom is limited owing to these severe cases of adverse effects; however, there is no clear evidence leading to the conclusion that bee venom therapy (BVT) is not safe [ [18](#B18-toxins-14-00238)]. In fact, two large cohort studies included in our review suggested that the incidence rate of anaphylaxis in response to BVA is 0.034% and 0.019% in 32,000 and 15,783 patients, respectively [ [19](#B19-toxins-14-00238), [20](#B20-toxins-14-00238)]. To overcome the limitations surrounding being outdated and individual studies using a small number of subjects to calculate incidence, we systematically reviewed the incidence rate of anaphylaxis in response to BVA. [14](#B14-toxins-14-00238)]. [21](#B21-toxins-14-00238)]. Nonsteroidal and antibiotics such as penicillins and sulfonamides are typical medications that can induce anaphylaxis, with incidence rates of 0.130%, 0.459%, and 0.151%, respectively [ [22](#B22-toxins-14-00238)]. Compared to these conventional drugs, the incidence of anaphylaxis due to BVA does not deviate significantly from normal levels. [23](#B23-toxins-14-00238)]. In our results, the more than three fold higher incidence of anaphylaxis in RCTs (0.142%) than in observational studies (0.044%) may be due to this limitation, along with the relatively small number of participants included. [24](#B24-toxins-14-00238), [25](#B25-toxins-14-00238)]. Although the mechanism of susceptibility to anaphylaxis is unclear, these studies support our findings that women show a higher incidence of anaphylaxis in response to BVA than men [ [26](#B26-toxins-14-00238)]. The data on main complaints and incidence of anaphylaxis show for which disease BVA was most frequently used, not which disease increases the incidence of BVA-related anaphylaxis. Out of a total of 58,448 participants with musculoskeletal and connective tissue diseases for which BVA was most frequently applied in clinics, 25 of them had a BVA-related anaphylactic reaction. Looking at the nature of the subjects' diseases, 98% of their chief complaints were musculoskeletal disorders such as herniated nucleus pulposus, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. In addition, BVA was applied to a total of 113 patients with neurological diseases (31 patients with Parkinson's disease, 20 with facial paralysis, 11 with peripheral neuropathy, and 51 with multiple sclerosis), of which 1 patient with multiple sclerosis had an anaphylactic reaction after BVA treatment. [27](#B27-toxins-14-00238)]. There is also evidence that skin tests are helpful in identifying possible anaphylaxis [ [28](#B28-toxins-14-00238)]. Surprisingly, in our study, the performance of a prior skin test did not affect the incidence rate of anaphylaxis due to BVA (0.041 vs. 0.047, [Table 2](#toxins-14-00238-t002)and [Figure 2](#toxins-14-00238-f002)). Due to a lack of detailed information, the current data cannot provide evidence of a causal relationship between skin testing and incidence. We argue that the predictive ability of skin tests for BVA-induced anaphylaxis may be poorer than we expected. In our previous study, we found that 80% of patients with BVA-induced anaphylaxis had undergone a skin test or showed no reaction to several BVA treatments before anaphylaxis occurred [ [14](#B14-toxins-14-00238)]. These findings might indicate that clinicians should not rely on a skin test, but instead pay attention to other risk factors. [29](#B29-toxins-14-00238), [30](#B30-toxins-14-00238)]. 4.
