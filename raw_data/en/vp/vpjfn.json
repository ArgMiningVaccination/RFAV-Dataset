But he refuses to vaccinate his three dogs. \"Giving your dog or cat so many shots can harm them and probably does nothing for them anyway,\" said the 39-year-old blogger, pet supply retailer and owner of Sammie, Reggie and Shubie. Habib is among a growing number of pet owners who think routine immunizations do more harm than good. He said he gave his brood \"core vaccinations\" against parvovirus, distemper, hepatitis and rabies when they were pups. But he maintains that the animals will retain their immunity for years - possibly even for life. Booster shots, Habib argues, expose pets to the same pathogens time and time again, raising the risk for immune disorders like allergies, infections and cancer. Not so, according to Dr. Kate Berger, a veterinarian at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Veterinary Medicine. Citing large, long-term studies in both dogs and cats, Berger said adverse reactions to vaccines are exceedingly rare and usually quite mild. \"Abnormal responses occur so infrequently, and more unvaccinated animals die from the diseases the vaccines prevent, that the benefit of vaccination outweighs the minimal risk of the abnormal immune response,\" Berger said.

The shots also protect people from diseases like rabies, which are transmitted through animal bites, Cavanaugh said. But some pet anti-vaxxers say vets who recommend routine immunizations are putting profits before pet safety. Dana Scott, publisher of Dogs Naturally Magazine and owner of seven Labrador Retrievers, maintains that vaccines are a money-maker for vets and drug makers and a considerable expense for owners. Core shots for a dog cost an average of $80 at most PETCOs for the initial round plus $60 a year for boosters. Optional seasonal protection against flu, Lyme disease and kennel cough - the dog version of whooping cough - run between $10 and $50 apiece. \"If vaccines were really so important, coyotes would have dropped dead years ago,\" Scott reasoned. Indeed, some studies suggest certain vaccines can provide immunity against a disease for up to seven years - but not for every animal in every circumstance. The vaccination schedule for each pet should be based on factors such as age, size, health and lifestyle, according to Berger. Pets that spend a lot of time in doggie parks, daycare and kennels should probably vaccinated more often, she said. "}
