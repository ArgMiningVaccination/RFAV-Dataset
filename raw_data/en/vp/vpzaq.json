Jacque Stewart, Military Advisor Jamie Hoffman, Student AdvisorYouth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Acknowledgments The 1999 Alaska Youth Risk Behavior Survey and the 1998 School Health Education Profile would not have been possible without the support of many individuals working cooperatively at allphases of the project. We would like to thank: School district superintendents and administrators, school boards, secondary school principals, teachers, parents and guardians who cooperated with and supported the survey; the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Adolescent and School Health, and Westat, Inc. for their technical assistance; and most importantly; the Alaska students who participated in the survey. iYouth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Introduction The Quality Schools Initiative set forth by the Knowles administration and the State Board of Education & Early Development provides a framework of four critical elements that schools andcommunities should strive to achieve. These elements are: High Student Academic Achievement High Standards for Teachers and Administrators Family and Community Involvement (and Safe and Respectful Schools) School Excellence Standards As the State of Alaska embarks upon the 21 st century, it is more important than ever to provide quality instruction. Many of our students struggle with issues and problems not addressed withinthe typical school day. In order to better understand and provide assistance to students, theAlaska Department of Education & Early Development and the Alaska Department of Health &Social Services have worked together to assess students' self reported behaviors andexperiences. By better understanding and addressing our students, schools, agencies, and communities will be better equipped to provide intervention, resources and quality prevention services. By addressingrisk behaviors early and providing support and guidance, schools will provide students with amuch greater opportunity to succeed in school and beyond. This report describes the methods and results of the 1999 Alaska Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the 1998 School Health Education Profile (SHEP). Each survey is intended toprovide a better understanding of health and related programs within school settings. The YRBS asks students to report their behaviors in six major areas of health that directly lead to morbidity and mortality in both adults and adolescents in our country. The SHEP asks teachersand administrators about programs and services to address these same areas of concern. Thisreport, combining data from both surveys, provides a comprehensive picture of the status ofadolescent health in Alaska. iiYouth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 How to Use This Report The results of the YRBS and SHEP can help detect changes in risk behaviors over time. The surveys help identify differences among ages, grades, and gender. The information from thesurveys will focus primary prevention efforts on specific groups of teens and can suggest whetheror not school policies and community programs are having the intended effects on studentbehaviors. Additionally, these results can assist school administrators and school boards ofeducation in emphasizing the importance of coordinated school health programs and preventioninitiatives within school buildings. Think of this report as a tool for starting discussions, for encouraging parent involvement, for educating the community, for planning and evaluating programs, for comparing Alaska studentswith other students nationwide, and for strengthening existing programs and policies. Starting the Conversation. Use this report to begin a conversation with young people about the personal choices they make or about the health of their peers. Ask them if the resultsaccurately reflect what they see happening around them. How do they explain the results?What ideas do they have about ways to promote healthy behaviors? From their perspective,what seems to be working and what isn't working? Increasing Awareness. This report provides an opportunity to break through \"denial\" and to make community members aware of the risks that their young people face. It can dispel mythsand correct misinformation about the \"average teenager.\" In addition, you can use the YRBSto accentuate the positive and to celebrate that many students are abstaining from behaviorsthat endanger their health and their ability to succeed. Planning and Evaluating Programs. The results of this report can serve as the basis for a school and/or community needs assessment. It can help identify strengths and weaknesses incurrent programs and can suggest strategies to address gaps in services to students.Identifying areas that need strengthening can expand professional development efforts withinschools and in the larger community. Alaska and National Comparisons. Since the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducts a biennial YRBS of a national sample of high school students,these results permit us to draw comparisons between students in Alaska and the nation. iiiYouth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Table of Contents Part I - Youth Risk Behavior Survey Youth Risk Behavior Survey Background .........................................................................

Part II-B1 vYouth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Youth Risk Behavior Survey Background The Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) is part of an epidemiological surveillance system that was established in 1988 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Itspurpose is to monitor the prevalence of behaviors that not only influence adolescent health, butalso put youth at risk for the most significant health and social problems that can occur duringadolescence and adulthood. The YRBS specifically investigates behaviors related to the leading causes of mortality, morbidity, and social problems among youth in the United States. Among deaths occurring to youths aged10-24 years, 73% are due to intentional and unintentional injuries. 2 Additionally, 86% of all sexually transmitted diseases occur among 15-29 year olds, and each year an estimated 1 millionteenage girls become pregnant. 3,4 One in every five persons diagnosed with AIDS in the U.S. is 20-29 years of age.3 Given that the incubation period from HIV infection to AIDS averages 10 years, many of these individuals were likely infected during their teenage years. Voluntary behaviors directly contribute to the deaths, diseases, and social problems described above. Examples of risk behaviors include: Carrying a weapon, physical fighting, suicideattempts, drinking or using drugs, lack of seatbelt or helmet use, and unprotected sexualintercourse. Many behaviors that contribute to preventable adult deaths are initiated during youth. Among adults in the U.S. over 25 years of age, 67% of deaths are caused by cardiovascular disease(43%) and cancer (24%) 1. Behaviors related to these causes of death include: Use of tobacco; excessive consumption of fats, calories, and sodium; insufficient consumption of fiber, fruits, andvegetables; and insufficient physical activity. The YRBS survey examines six categories of adolescent behavior:behaviors that result in unintentional and intentional injuries; tobacco use; alcohol and other drug use; sexual behaviors that can result in HIV infection, other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and unintended pregnancies; dietary behaviors; and physical activity. The YRBS high school survey was first implemented at the national level in 1990. Since then the CDC has sponsored national and state surveys in 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997, and 1999. A middle/junior high school version of the YRBS was implemented for the first time in 1995. Alaska firstparticipated in the YRBS in 1995 at both the high school and middle school levels. The YRBSwas not administered in Alaska in 1997. Part I-1Youth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Methodology The 1999 YRBS was intended to be an exact replica of the 1995 Alaska statewide survey so that data could be compared across several years. However, the Anchorage school district chose notto participate in the 1999 statewide survey. As a result, the 1999 statewide survey results forAlaska are not comparable to 1995. However, the 1999 YRBS survey results do providerepresentative prevalence data for the state's student population excluding Anchorage. The samples were scientifically selected with each eligible student in the school population having an equal probability of being selected. This sampling process is most often referred to asprobability sampling. The size of a sample is related directly to the size of the eligible population,the estimated student response rate, and the desired precision of the results. The eligible studentpopulation was determined from the official 1998 October enrollment counts reported by theAlaska State Department of Education & Early Development. The enrollment count was edited toinclude only students in grades 7 through 12. The school list was edited to removecorrespondence, home study, alternative, and correctional schools. A sufficient number ofstudents were selected to give a plus or minus five percent margin of error for each question. A two-stage sample design was used to select the actual students for participation. The first stage consisted of selecting schools. Schools were selected with probability proportional to thesize of their enrollment. Alaska has a large number of small schools, which means that moreschools were needed to obtain the number of students required for the desired level of precision.Once a school was selected, classes were selected as the second stage. Eligible classes werethose where a student would be enrolled in one, and only one, class at a time. (For example,second period, or required English). This gave each student an equal opportunity of beingselected. At any time a school district, an individual school, a student's parents, or a specificstudent had the opportunity to decline to participate in the survey. The numbers sampled in each stage were adjusted upward in anticipation that some schools and students would fail to participate. To ensure that sample results can be generalized to the totalpopulation, the overall participation rate (school participation rate multiplied by the studentparticipation rate) must be equal to or greater than 60 percent. At the classroom level, teachers were given a script to read to students that established guidelines for student privacy and anonymity, and the importance of the survey. Each student wasgiven an unmarked envelope in which to seal his or her survey before turning it in. These surveyenvelopes remained sealed until received at a central state collection site. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Westat, Inc., a CDC contractor, analyzed the state survey data. Analysis included the scanning of the surveys and performance ofextensive edit checks to identify survey inconsistencies. When inconsistencies were found,responses were excluded from the analysis. For example, if a student reported in one questionhaving never been in a physical fight, but then reported in another question being hurt in a physicalfight, the data on that student was excluded for the two questions related to physical fighting. Part I-2Youth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Survey Limitations The 1999 YRBS provides descriptive data on the who, what, where, and when of the self- reported behaviors in a number of major risk categories. The YRBS survey does not attempt to answer thequestion of why and how. The descriptive data represents only students attending school outsidethe Anchorage area. The high school and middle school results differ significantly in what they represent: High school (grades 9 - 12) results are weighted and provide estimates of the prevalence of risk behaviors in students enrolled in eligible schools. Eligible schools are those outsidethe Anchorage school district excluding correspondence, home study, alternative, andcorrectional schools. Also, youth who dropped out of school are not included. Middle school (grades 7 and 8) results are not weighted to the general student population because of a low overall participation rate. However, these results are useful indetermining the prevalence of risk behaviors in a large number of Alaska's seventh andeighth grade students in 1999 and will give users insight into the needs and behaviors ofstudents in this age group. Caution must be used when comparing high school and middle school questions. Many of the questions asked in the middle school survey have a different time frame and tend to be broaderand more general than the high school questions. Also, the middle school survey contains 50questions compared to 87 in the high school survey. Finally, combining middle school and highschool responses would mean that the weights associated with the high school students could notbe applied. Any analysis of the combined records would apply only to the students that participated in the surveys. The 1999 YRBS results are not directly comparable to the 1995 YRBS results. Part I-3Youth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Participation in the Statewide survey A primary goal of Alaska's YRBS is to obtain representative prevalence estimates for youth enrolled in the public school system. In 1999 Alaska reported 55 school districts having acombined enrollment of 59,823 of middle school and high school students in grades 7 through 12.The YRBS questionnaire is administered to students attending class on the scheduled day underthe supervision of a trained administrator. Correspondence, home study, alternative, orcorrectional schools are excluded from participation in the YRBS for administrative reasons. Assuch, one school district, 11 middle schools, and 13 high schools were excluded from the sample.A second school district was excluded because it declined to participate. The sample was drawnfrom the remaining 53 school districts having a combined enrollment of 37,271 in 254 schools. Middle School ParticipationThe middle school sample was drawn with a desired precision of \u00b15 percent. The middle school sample included 62 schools from 30 districts and sought 1,427 completed questionnaires. Theresults fall short of this goal, 975 middle school students in 34 schools completed surveys. Theoverall response rate was 48 percent based on a school participation rate of 58 percent and astudent response rate of 83 percent. The middle school survey results represent the riskbehaviors of a large number of students in the seventh and eighth grades but cannot begeneralized to all eligible middle schools students. Table 1 provides a comparison of the sampledstudents to both the statewide enrollment and the actual eligible population. Users of the middleschool survey results should take notice of how the sample may over or under represent themeasured characteristics in the general student population.

Part I-4Youth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 High School Participation The high school sample was drawn with a desired precision of \u00b15 percent. The high school sample included 36 schools from 19 districts and sought 1,462 completed questionnaires. Theoverall response rate was 66 percent (1,427 students) with 83 percent of the schools and 80percent of the students participating. The high school survey results can be generalized to theeligible students in grades 9 - 12. Table 2 provides a comparison of the sampled student charac-teristics to those characteristics in the statewide enrollment as well as the characteristics in theeligible population. The adjusted weighted percents closely mirror the percents of students by sexand grade, but not race/ethnicity. This is because the gender/grade characteristics reported byeach participating class were used to calculate the final weighted value.

Themajority of Alaska smokers (almost 80%) began smoking between the ages of 10 and 20years 5. Alaskans have been working to decrease youth tobacco use through increasing the tax on tobacco products, education of young people, enforcement of laws restricting sales tominors, and a statewide ban on self-service tobacco displays. 6 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended a comprehensive approach to decreasing bothyouth and adult tobacco use. 7Section II - Tobacco Use Year 2000 Objectives: \u00b7Increase by at least one year the average age of first use of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana by adolescents aged 12-17. \u00b7Reduce the initiation of cigarette smoking by children and youth so that no more than 15% have become regular cigarette smokers by age 20.YRBS Results Percent of Students18.1%33.9%71.5% 16.7%36.4%70.2% 020406080100 Ever Smoked Cigarettes Cigarette Use (c)Alaska: 1999 U.S.: 1997Youth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Stole ThemSomeone Else BoughtBought at a Store Some Other WayBorrowedVending Machine .3% Part I-16 High School Results (excluding Anchorage)Smoked Cigarettes on 20 (or more) of the 30 Days Prior to the Survey During the 30 days prior to the survey, most Alaska high school students obtained cigarettes in the following ways: Borrowed from someone else, someone else bought the cigarettes, or the studentpurchased his/her own cigarettes.

Additionally, 34.4% report binge drinking (five or more drinks in a row at least once in thepast 30 days). Alaska students are similar to U.S. students.Alcohol Use Among High School StudentsBackground Alcohol and drug abuse are major contributing factors in homicides, suicides, and motorvehicle crashes, the leading causes of death and disability among young people in the U.S.and in Alaska. Heavy drinking and drug abuse among youth are linked to physical fights,destroyed property, job problems, school failure, delinquency, unwanted pregnancies, andtransmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 8 An estimated 19.2% of Alaska adults report binge drinking (having five or more drinks on anoccasion, one or more time in the past month).

The data suggest that more boys (8.3%) are overweight than girls(6.2%). However, this finding could be attributable to girls underreporting their actual weight.Students Who Are Overweight and Students at Risk for Becoming Overweight (As Determined by Body Mass Index BMI*) a) Students who were at or above the 95th percentile for body mass index (BMI) by age and sex based on reference data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey I. b) Students who were at or above the 85th percentile but below the 95th percentile for body mass index (BMI) by age and sex based on reference data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey I. * Body Mass Index (BMI) is one way to measure obesity. BMI is calculated by using the formula: weight in kilograms divided by h eight in meters squared (BMI = kg/m2). See appendix C for Reference Data for Obesity Table. Year 2000 Objectives: \u00b7Reduce overweight to a prevalence of no more than 20% among people aged 20 and older and no more than 15% among adolescents aged 12-19. \u00b7Increase to at least 50% the proportion of overweight people age 12 and older who have adopted sound dietary practices combined with regular physical activity to obtain appropriate body weight.Background National data show that obesity is increasing among adolescents. Obesity acquired during childhood often persists into adulthood, increasing the later risk for diabetes, high bloodpressure, and heart disease. In addition, obesity can cause social and psychological stress tochildren and adolescents. 11 Likewise, an overemphasis on thinness may also be unhealthy. To avoid problems of obesityand eating disorders, healthy eating habits should be encouraged among adolescents. Currentdietary guidelines include increasing consumption of breads, grains and cereals, eating at leastfive servings of fruits and vegetables per day, and maintaining a healthy weight. 12 YRBS Results Percent of Students 17.2 8.3%13.8 6.2% 020406080100 a) Overweight b) At Risk for Becoming OverweightAlaska Boys Alaska GirlsYouth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Part I-30 High School Results (excluding Anchorage)Describe Themselves As Overweight Although 43.4% of girls describe themselves as overweight, 61.8% are trying to lose weight.

Year 2000 Objectives: \u00b7Reduce overweight to a prevalence of no more than 20% among people aged 20 and older and no more than 15% among adolescents aged 12-19. \u00b7Increase to at least 50% the proportion of overweight people age 12 and older who have adopted sound dietary practices combined with regular physical activity to obtain appropriate body weight.Background National data show that obesity is increasing among adolescents. Obesity acquired duringchildhood often persists into adulthood, increasing the later risk for diabetes, high bloodpressure, and heart disease. In addition, obesity can cause social and psychological stress tochildren and adolescents. 11 Likewise, an overemphasis on thinness may also be unhealthy. To avoid problems of obesityand eating disorders, healthy eating habits should be encouraged among adolescents. Currentdietary guidelines include increasing consumption of breads, grains and cereals, eating at leastfive servings of fruits and vegetables per day, and maintaining a healthy weight. 12Percent of Students26.8% 11.1%14.7% 7.1% 020406080100 a) Overweight b) At Risk for Becoming OverweightAlaska Boys Alaska GirlsYouth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Part I-52 Middle School Results (unweighted)Describe Themselves as Overweight, About Right, and Underweight A little over one-third of middle school girls describe themselves as overweight. Girls are morelikely than boys to describe themselves as overweight and boys are more likely to describethemselves as underweight or of normal weight. Although 35.3% of girls describe themselves as overweight, 55.1% are trying to lose weight. Thedifference between perception of being overweight (22.5%) and trying to lose weight (31.4%) isnot as dramatic among boys.Trying to Lose of StudentsPercent of Students26.454.3 19.349.8 14.935.3 020406080100 Under Weight About Right WeightAlaska Boys Alaska Girls 55.1 33.4 020406080100 Boys GirlsYouth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Part I-53 Middle School Results (unweighted)The most common methods ever used by middle school students to lose or keep from gaining weight are exercise and dieting. About 8% of middle school girls report that they have vomited orused laxatives for weight loss and about 11% report that they have used diet pills.Methods Ever Used to Lose or Keep from Gaining Weight Percent of Students 6.6% 5.6%57.7% 37 11.2%7.9%73.2% 55.4% 02040608010 Diet School Results (unweighted)Section VI: Physical Activity Over 73% of middle school boys and girls report that they have exercised or played sports 3 of the past 7 days. Only 48% of middle school students attend physical education 5 days a week (datanot shown). Both boys and girls report similar exercise frequencies. Additionally, over 60% ofmiddle school students report watching 2 or more hours of TV on an average school day.Participation in Exercise or Sports Activities Year 2000 Objectives: \u00b7Increase to at least 30% the proportion of people aged 6 and older who engage regularly, preferably daily, in light to moderate physical activity for at least 30 minutes per day. \u00b7Increase to at least 20% the proportion of people aged 18 and older and to at least 75% the proportion of children and adolescents aged 6-17 who engage in vigorous physical activity that promotes the development and maintenance of cardiorespiratory fitness 3 or more days per week for 20 or more minutes per occasion.Background Regular physical activity can increase life expectancy. Physical activity can also enhancemental health and self-esteem, of particular benefit to adolescents. Development of good exercise habits in childhood and adolescence which are maintained into adulthood can preventor delay many chronic diseases. 13 YRBS Results Percent of Students Exercised/Played Sports (3 of past 7 Days )Attend P.E.

Approximately nine out of ten homicide victims in the United States are killed with a weapon ofsome type, such as a gun, knife, or club. 9 Homicide is the second leading cause of death among all youth aged 15-24 (20.3 per 100,000) and is the leading cause of death among black youthaged 15-24 (74.4 per 100,000). 6 During adolescence, homicide rates increase substantially from a negligible rate of 1.5 per 100,000 in youth aged 5-14 to 20.3 per 100,000 in youth aged 15-24.10 Firearms markedly elevate the severity of the health consequences of violent behavior.11Youth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Part I-D3 Item Rationale for 1999 YRBSFirearm-related homicide and firearm-related suicide accounted for 44% and 51%, respectively, of all firearm injury deaths in 1995.10 Unintentional firearm-related fatalities also are a critical problem among children and young adults in the United States.10 During 1996-1997, there were approximately 190,000 fights that did not include a weapon, 115,000 thefts, and 98,000 incidentsof vandalism in US schools. 12 Nearly 70% of U.S. school districts prohibit students from possessing and using a weapon in the school building or on school grounds.13 __________________________ QUESTION(S): 17. During the past 12 months, how many times were you in a physical fight?18. During the past 12 months, how many times were you in a physical fight in which you were injured and had to be treated by a doctor or nurse? 19. During the past 12 months, how many times were you in a physical fight on school property?20. During the past 12 months, did your boyfriend or girlfriend ever hit, slap, or physically hurt you on purpose? 21. Have you ever been forced to have sexual intercourse when you did not want to?RATIONALE:These questions measure the frequency and severity of physical fights, school-related fights, and abusive behavior. Physical fighting is an antecedent for many fatal and nonfatal injuries. 14 During 1996-97, nearly 200,000 fights or physical attacks occurred at schools.12 Nearly 60% of adolescents report at least one episode of dating violence15 , while 20% report they had experienced forced sex.16 Forced sex has been associated with suicidal ideation and attempts,17 alcohol and drug use,18 and increased risk of chronic diseases and somatic symptoms in both reproductive and nonreproductive organ systems.19 __________________________Youth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Part I-D4 Item Rationale for 1999 YRBSQUESTION(S): 22. During the past 12 months, did you ever feel so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more in a row that you stopped doing some usual activities? 23. During the past 12 months, did you ever seriously consider attempting suicide?24. During the past 12 months, did you make a plan about how you would attempt suicide?25. During the past 12 months, how many times did you actually attempt suicide?26. If you attempted suicide during the past 12 months, did any attempt result in an injury, poisoning, or overdose that had to be treated by a doctor or nurse? RATIONALE:These questions measure sadness, attempted suicides, and the seriousness of those attempts. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among youth aged 15-24 and the second leadingcause of death among white youth aged 15-24. 6 The suicide rate for persons aged 15-24 has tripled since 1950, and in 1995 was 13.3 per 100,000.6,20 Tobacco Use QUESTION(S): 27. Have you ever tried cigarette smoking, even one or two puffs?28. How old were you when you smoked a whole cigarette for the first time?29. During the past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke cigarettes?30. During the past 30 days, on the days you smoked, how many cigarettes did you smoke per day? 31. During the past 30 days, how did you usually get your own cigarettes?32. When you bought cigarettes in a store during the past 30 days, were you ever asked to show proof of age? 33. During the past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke cigarettes on school property?34. Have you ever smoked cigarettes regularly, that is, at least one cigarette every day for 30 days? 35. Have you ever tried to quit smoking cigarettes?Youth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Part I-D5 Item Rationale for 1999 YRBSRATIONALE: These questions measure smoking experimentation, current smoking patterns, age of initiation, adherence to Federal regulations regarding sale of cigarettes, smoking on school property, andattempts to quit smoking. Tobacco use is considered the chief preventable cause of death in theUnited States 21 with over 20% of all deaths attributable to tobacco use.22 Cigarette smoking is responsible for heart disease; cancers of the lung, larynx, mouth, esophagus, and bladder; stroke;and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 21 In addition, there is evidence that cigarette smokers are more likely to drink alcohol and use marijuana and cocaine as compared to non smokers.21 If current patterns of smoking behavior persist, an estimated 5 million U.S. persons who were aged0 -17 years in 1995 could die prematurely from smoking-related illnesses. 23 In 1996, the Food and Drug Administration issued regulations to implement the 1993 law known as the \"Synar Amendment, \" which restricts the sale and distribution of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to children and teenagers under age 18.24 Over 80% of U.S. school districts prohibit tobacco use in the school building and on the grounds at all times.13 __________________________ QUESTION(S): 36. During the past 30 days, on how many days did you use chewing tobacco or snuff, such as Redman, Levi Garrett, Beechnut, Skoal, Skoal Bandits, or Copenhagen? 37. During the past 30 days, on how many days did you use chewing tobacco or snuff on school property? 38. During the past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke cigars, cigarillos, or little cigars?RATIONALE:These questions measure smokeless tobacco use, smokeless tobacco use on school property, and cigar use. Smokeless tobacco has been associated with leukoplakia, oral cancers, tooth andgum disease, and cardiovascular disease. 21 Smokeless tobacco use primarily begins in early adolescence.25 Between 1970 and 1986, the prevalence of snuff use increased 15 times and chewing tobacco use increased four times among men aged 17-19.21 Cigar smoking has been associated with cancers of the oral cavity, larynx, esophagus, and lungs and with chronicobstructive lung disease. 26 In 1997, the prevalence of cigar use in the past month among high school students was 31.2% among males and 10.8% among females.27Youth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Part I-D6 Item Rationale for 1999 YRBSAlcohol and Other Drug Use QUESTION(S): 39. During your life, on how many days have you had at least one drink of alcohol?40. How old were you when you had your first drink of alcohol other than a few sips?41. During the past 30 days, on how many days did you have at least one drink of alcohol?42. During the past 30 days, on how many days did you have 5 or more drinks of alcohol in a row, that is, within a couple of hours? 43. During the past 30 days, on how many days did you have at least one drink of alcohol on school property? RATIONALE:These questions measure frequency of alcohol use, age of initiation, heavy drinking, and drinking on school property. Alcohol is a major contributing factor in approximately half of all homicides,suicides, and motor vehicle crashes, which are the leading causes of death and disability amongyoung people. 28 Heavy drinking among youth has been linked to multiple sexual partners, use of marijuana, and poor academic performance.29 __________________________ QUESTION(S): 44. During your life, how many times have you used marijuana?45. How old were you when you tried marijuana for the first time?46. During the past 30 days, how many times did you use marijuana?47. During the past 30 days, how many times did you use marijuana on school property?48. During your life, how many times have you used any form of cocaine, including powder, crack, or freebase? 49. During the past 30 days, how many times did you use any form of cocaine, including powder, crack, or freebase? 50. During your life, how many times have you sniffed glue, or breathed the contents of aerosol spray cans, or inhaled any paints or sprays to get high?Youth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Part I-D7 Item Rationale for 1999 YRBS51. During the past 30 days, how many times have you sniffed glue, breathed the contents of aerosol spray cans, or inhaled any paints or sprays to get high? 52. During your life, how many times have you used heroin (also called smack, junk, or China White)? 53. During your life, how many times have you used methamphetamines (also called speed, crystal, crank, or ice)? 54.

During your life, how many times have you used a needle to inject any illegal drug into your body? 56. During the past 12 months, has anyone offered, sold, or given you an illegal drug on school property? RATIONALE:These questions measure the frequency of marijuana, cocaine, inhalant, heroin, methamphetamine, steroid, and injected drug use. In addition to morbidity and mortality due toinjury, drug abuse is related to suicide, early unwanted pregnancy, school failure, delinquency, andtransmissions of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) infection. 30,31 Despite improvements in recent years, drug use is greater among high school students and other young adults in the U.S. than has been documented in any other industrializednation in the world. 32Youth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Part I-D8 Item Rationale for 1999 YRBSSexual Behaviors That Result in HIV Infection, Other Sexually Transmitted Diseases,and Unintended Pregnancies QUESTION(S): 57. Have you ever had sexual intercourse?58. How old were you when you had sexual intercourse for the first time?59. During your life, with how many people have you had sexual intercourse?60. During the past 3 months, with how many people did you have sexual intercourse?61. Did you drink alcohol or use drugs before you had sexual intercourse the last time?62. The last time you had sexual intercourse, did you or your partner use a condom?87. Have you ever been taught about AIDS or HIV infection in school?RATIONALE:These questions measure the prevalence of sexual activity, number of sexual partners, age at first intercourse, alcohol and drug use related to sexual activity, condom use, and whether studentshave received HIV education. Early sexual activity is associated with unwanted pregnancy andsexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV infection, and negative effects on social andpsychological development. 33 Number of sexual partners and age at first intercourse are associated with increased risk for STDs. Alcohol and other drug use may serve as predisposingfactors for initiation of sexual activity and unprotected sexual intercourse. 34 AIDS is the 6th leading cause of death for youth aged 15-24.6 Use of latex condoms by males, when used consistently and correctly, are highly effective at reducing the risk of HIV infection and other sexuallytransmitted diseases (STDs). 35 In 1994, 86% of middle/junior and senior high schools taught HIV prevention education in a required course.36 __________________________Youth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Part I-D9 Item Rationale for 1999 YRBSQUESTION(S): 63. The last time you had sexual intercourse, what one method did you or your partner use to prevent pregnancy? 64. How many times have you been pregnant or gotten someone pregnant? RATIONALE:These questions measure use of contraception and identify whether a student has been pregnant or gotten someone pregnant. Pregnancies that occur during adolescence place both mothers andinfants at risk for lifelong social and economic disadvantages. 33 In 1995, almost one million teenage girls in the United States became pregnant, just over 243,000 teenagers obtained anabortion, 37 and nearly 492,000 gave birth.38 In 1996, the birth rate for youth aged 15-19 was 54.4 per 1,000 women.38 Sixty-six percent of all births among teenagers are the result of unintended pregnancy.39 Weight and Dietary Behaviors QUESTION(S): 5. How tall are you without your shoes on?6. How much do you weigh without your shoes on?65. How do you describe your weight?66. Which of the following are you trying to do about your weight?67. During the past 30 days, did you exercise to lose weight or to keep from gaining weight?68. During the past 30 days, did you eat less food, fewer calories, or foods low in fat to lose weight or to keep from gaining weight? 69. During the past 30 days, did you go without eating for 24 hours or more (also called fasting) to lose weight or to keep from gaining weight? 70. During the past 30 days, did you take any diet pills, powders, or liquids without a doctor 's advice to lose weight or to keep from gaining weight? (Do not include meal replacementproducts such as Slim Fast.) 71. During the past 30 days, did you vomit or take laxatives to lose weight or to keep from gaining weight?Youth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Part I-D10 Item Rationale for 1999 YRBSRATIONALE: These questions measure self-reported height and weight, self-perception of body weight status, and specific weight control behaviors. Data on self-reported height and weight can be used tocalculate body mass index and provide a reasonable proxy measure of whether students areoverweight. Although overweight prevalence estimates derived from self-reported data are likelyto be low, 40,41 they can be useful in tracking trends over time. Prevalence trends from national surveys of adults using self-reported height and weight have been consistent with trend data fromnational surveys using measured heights and weights. 42 The prevalence of overweight among adolescents more than doubled from 5% in the late 1970s to 11% between 1988 and 1994.43 Overweight or obesity acquired during childhood or adolescence may persist into adulthood andincrease the risk later in life for coronary heart disease, gallbladder disease, some types ofcancer, and osteoarthritis of the weight-bearing joints. 44 In adolescence, obesity is associated with: hyperlipidemia, hypertension, abnormal glucose tolerance, and adverse psychological andsocial consequences. 45 Studies have shown high rates of body dissatisfaction and dieting among adolescent females, with many engaging in unhealthy weight control behaviors, such as fastingand self-induced vomiting. 46-49 __________________________ QUESTION(S): 72. During the past 7 days, how many times did you drink 100% fruit juices such as orange juice, apple juice, or grape juice? (Do not count punch, Kool-Aid, sports drinks, or other fruit-flavored drinks.) 73. During the past 7 days, how many times did you eat fruit? (Do not count fruit juice.)74. During the past 7 days, how many times did you eat green salad?75. During the past 7 days, how many times did you eat potatoes? (Do not count french fries, fried potatoes, or potato chips.) 76. During the past 7 days, how many times did you eat carrots?77. During the past 7 days, how many times did you eat other vegetables? (Do not count green salad, potatoes, or carrots.) 78. During the past 7 days, how many glasses of milk did you drink? (Include the milk you drank in a glass or cup, from a carton, or with cereal. Count the half pint of milk served at school asequal to one glass.)Youth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Part I-D11 Item Rationale for 1999 YRBSRATIONALE: These questions measure food choices. Six of the questions address fruit and vegetable consumption, and one addresses consumption of milk. The fruit and vegetable questions aresimilar to questions asked of adults on CDC 's Behavioral Risk Factor Survey. 50 Fruits and vegetables are good sources of complex carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and other substancesthat are important for good health. Dietary patterns with higher intakes of fruits and vegetablesare associated with a variety of health benefits, including a decreased risk for some types ofcancer. 44,51 Only 44% of male adolescents and 27% of female adolescents meet the minimum average daily goal of at least five servings of vegetables and fruits set by the Dietary Guidelines for American s.52 Milk is by far the largest single source of calcium for adolescents,53 but it is estimated that about half of adolescent males and more than 80% of adolescent females do notmeet dietary recommendations for calcium intake. 54 Calcium is essential for the formation and maintenance of bones and teeth;44 low calcium intake during the first two to three decades of life is an important risk factor in the development of osteoporosis.55 Physical Activity QUESTION(S): 79. On how many of the past 7 days did you exercise or participate in physical activity for at least 20 minutes that made you sweat and breathe hard, such as basketball, soccer, running,swimming laps, fast bicycling, fast dancing, or similar aerobic activity? 80. On how many of the past 7 days did you participate in physical activity for at least 30 minutes that did not make you sweat or breathe hard, such as fast walking, slow bicycling, skating,pushing a lawn mower, or mopping floors? 81. On how many of the past 7 days did you exercise to strengthen or tone your muscles, such as push-ups, sit-ups, or weight lifting? 82. On an average school day, how many hours do you watch TV?83. In an average week when you are in school, on how many days do you go to physical education (PE) classes? 84. During an average physical education (PE) class, how many minutes do you spend actually exercising or playing sports? 85. During the past 12 months, on how many sports teams did you play? (Include any teams run by your school or community groups.) 86. During the past 12 months, how many times were you injured while exercising, playing sports, or being physically active and had to be treated by a doctor or nurse?Youth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Part I-D12 Item Rationale for 1999 YRBSRATIONALE: These questions measure participation in physical activity, physical education classes, sports teams, television watching, and injuries during physical activity. Participation in regularphysical activity helps build and maintain healthy bones and muscles, control weight, buildlean muscle, and reduce fat; reduces feelings of depression and anxiety; and promotespsychological well-being. 56 In the long term, regular physical activity decreases the risk of dying prematurely; dying of heart disease; and developing diabetes, colon cancer, and highblood pressure. 56 Major decreases in vigorous physical activity occur during grades 9-12, particularly for girls. By 11th grade, more than half of female students are not participating regularly in vigorous physical activity.56 School physical education classes can increase adolescent participation in moderate to vigorous physical activity57,58 and help adolescents develop the knowledge, attitudes, and skills they need to engage in lifelong physical activity.59 Daily participation in physical education class has dropped from 42% in 1991 to 25% in1995. 56 Television viewing is the principal sedentary leisure time behavior in the U.S. and studies have shown that television viewing in young people is related to obesity60 and violent or aggressive behavior.61,62 Among youth aged 14-17, sports-related injuries are the leading cause of non-fatal injuries.63Youth Risk Behavior Survey-1999 Part I-D13 Item Rationale for 1999 YRBSREFERENCES 1.

The questionnaires were developed by the Division of Adolescentand School Health, National Centers for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration with representatives of 75state, local, and territorial departments of education. The principals ' questionnaire examines health education and HIV prevention education from an administrative perspective. The leadhealth education teachers ' questionnaire looks at health education from an instructional perspective. Participation, Methodology , and Survey Limitations: All regular secondary schools having at least one of the grades 6 through 12 were included in thesampling frame. Schools were sorted by estimated enrollment in the target grades within schoolgrade level (middle schools, other) before sampling. The principal and lead health teacher weresurveyed in each participating school. The questionnaire was mailed during the spring of 1998.A weight was associated with each questionnaire to reflect the likelihood of a principal or teacherbeing selected, to reduce bias by compensating for differing patterns of nonresponse, and toimprove precision by making school sample distributions conform to known populationdistributions. The estimated error rate, using a normal approximation, is less than 5 percent.Usable questionnaires were received from 222 of 316 principals (39 middle and 183 other) whoreceived the principal questionnaire, for a 70 percent return rate. The weighted results of the Principal Survey can be used to make important inferences concerning the healtheducation attributes of all regular secondary public schools having at least one of thegrades 6 through 12.Usable questionnaires were received from 190 of the 316 lead health teachers who received theteacher questionnaire for a 60 percent response rate. Given the low teacher response rate, the results of the Lead Health Teacher Survey can only be used to summarize the healtheducation attributes of lead health teachers in participating schools.Youth Risk Behavior Survey-1999Two coursesThree course One CourseFour coursesNo separate health education course required Part II-1 Principal's Survey ResultsTopic 1 Rationale These questions provide current information on theextent to which healtheducation is required andin what grades it isrequired. Recent studiesexamined school healtheducation policies thestate 1992;NASBE, 1991)and implementation policies 1995). The perceivedimportance of healtheducation often isindicated by whether it isrequired in schools. These questions also help monitor progress onnational health objective8.4, to increase to at least75 percent the Nation'selementary andsecondary schools thatprovide planned andsequential kindergartenthrough 12 th grade quality school health education(U.S. Public HealthService, 1990). This question measures the extent to which healtheducation is offered inthese grades .Requirements for Health Education Question Is health education required for students in any of grades 6 through12 in this school?

The American School Health Associationrecommends thatelementary and middleschool students receive 50hours of secondarystudents receive 150hours of health education(Allensworth, 1993).Question Is required health education taught in any of the following ways tostudents in grades 6 through 12 in this school? Results Ninety percent of the principals indicated that health education was required for students in any of the grades 6through 12 at their schools. Fifty-four percent of the principals reported that their students took one required course in health education while 8%indicated that no separate health education course wasrequired. Eighty-two percent of the principals indicated that a required health education course was taught in ninth grade. Sixty-four percent of the principals indicated that required health education was taught as a course divided betweenhealth education and one other course. Seventy-five percent of the principals said that health education units or lessons were integrated into othersubjects.Units or lessons on health education integrated into other subjects Non-classroom programs or activitiesA course divided between health education and one other subject Recommendations Health education should be taught as a separate course. It should include planned, sequential, and comprehensiveinstruction that occurs every year. Whenever possible, health should also be integrated into other courses or included in non-classroom activities to reinforcehealth education concepts and skills.Requirements for Health Education 55%64%75% 0 2 04 06 08 0 1 0 0Part II-3 Principal 's Survey ResultsTopic 2 Rationale This question measures the extent to whichstudents are exemptedfrom health education byparental request.Parental involvement is akey element of schoolhealth programs (Kolbe,1993). this topiccan be used todemonstrate parentalsupport for requiredhealth education.Exemptions from Health Education QuestionDuring this school year, about what percent of students in grades 6through 12 were exempted or excused from any part of a requiredhealth education course by parental request? Results Thirty-seven percent of principals reported that students cannot be exempted or excused from any part of a required healtheducation course by parental request. Fifty-one percent of principals reported that less than one percent of students were exempted. Recommendations Parents should be involved in school health programs and they should be informed about content and skills taught in healtheducation.

Results Thirty-one percent of principals reported that health education was coordinated by principals. Twenty-three percent of principals reported that health education was coordinated by a health teacher and 21% said thatcurriculum coordination was performed by district curriculumcoordinators. Ten percent of the principals reported that no one coordinates health education. Recommendations Each school needs to designate a person at the school build- ing level to coordinate health education.

Theuse of peer educators isan effective tool in healtheducation (Allensworth,1993). As a part of health education, peereducators may addressattitudes and modelbehaviors in a mannerthat is more acceptableto students.Peer Educators in Health Education QuestionDuring this school year, has this school used trained peereducators to help teach about health in grades 6 through 12? Results Over one-quarter of principals indicated the use of peer educators to help teach health education. Recommendations Peer education should be used when appropriate, since it represents an underused strategy that can complement traditionalclassroom teaching. Peers can often reach students when otherapproaches fail. In addition to health instruction, peer educators should be used as models of health enhancing behaviors.Yes (28%) No (68%)Don't Know (3%)Part II-6 Principal 's This measuresthe to which schoolhealth present withinschools.

Results Only 10% of the principals reported that their school had aschool health advisory council or similar committee that met ona regular basis to address policies or programs related toschool health. Recommendations Every school should have a health advisory council or similarcommittee comprised of diverse school and communityrepresentatives, including students and parents. School health advisory councils should evaluate theircoordinated school health programming and makesuggestions for improvement, especially in areas such ashealth education and school health policy.Don't Know (3%) Yes (10%)No (87%)Part II-7 Principal 's Survey Results Topic 6 Rationale This question measures parental feedback abouthealth education.Parental involvement is akey element of schoolhealth programs (Kolbe,1993). this topiccan be used todemonstrate parentalsupport for requiredhealth education.Parental Feedback about Health Education QuestionDuring this school year, how would you describe parental feedbackabout health education in this school? Results Fifty-six percent of the principals reported that they did not receive any parental feedback about health education. Thirty-seven percent of principals indicated that they received mainly positive feedback. Only 1% indicated that the feedback was mostly negative. Six percent of principals reported balanced feedback. Recommendations Since over 50% of the principals reported no parental feedback concerning health education, strategies to increase parentalinvolvement should be implemented. These strategies mightinclude parent/student homework assignments or parentalinvolvement on school health advisory councils.Negative feedback (1%) Positive feedback (37%)No feedback (56%)Equally balanced feedback (6%)Part II-8 Principal 's Survey ResultsTopic 7 Rationale This question measures support for inservicetraining. Continuingeducation in areascongruent with curriculumand student needs is akey element of qualityschool health educationcurriculum. The School Health found thatappropriate in-servicetraining enhanced theimplementation andeffectiveness of healtheducation (Cornell, Turner, and Mason, 1985). The School Health Policies and ProgramsStudy findings underscorethe importance ofinservice training forhealth education staff(Collins et al., 1995).Health Education Inservice Training QuestionDuring this school year, has this school or district supported healtheducation-related inservice training or staff development in any ofthe following ways for health education teachers? Results Forty-seven percent of the principals reported that their school or district provided inservice training in health education. Forty-two percent of the principals provided for substitute teachers during training. Twenty-one percent of the principals provided stipends for teachers attending training while 26% provided reimbursementfor training expenses.Offers inservice training at school or district Provides substitute teachers during training Provides reimbursement for training expenses Provides stipend for attending training Recommendations Since fewer that half of the principals indicated that inservice training was currently being provided, high quality teachertraining in health education should be a priority to ensurequality health education programs in schools. Monetary or similar incentives should be provided to those who attend professional development activities.21%26%42%47% 02 04 06 0Part II-9 Principal's Survey Results Topic 8 Rationale These questions measure the extent towhich required HIVeducation isimplemented.

Forty-one percent of principals indicated that HIV infection/AIDS education occurred in grades 7, 8, and 12 and 44% in grade 11. Over 90% of principals reported that most HIV infection/AIDS education was taught in health education classes. Fifty-three percent of principals indicated that HIV infection/AIDS education took place in science, while only 17% said that itoccurred in physical education classes. Recommendations All students should have HIV infection/AIDS education beginning in grade 7 and in each subsequent year. Since HIV infection/AIDS education is taught by health educators and instructors who teach in other content areas,inservice training should be provided to individuals who teacha variety of content areas including health education, science,physical education, home economics, family life education, orlife skills. Special education teachers also should receive training to assist their students in avoiding HIV infection.Topic 8 (continued) HIV/AIDS These questions of schoolpolicies for students andstaff with HIV infection/AIDS. These policies arenecessary to protect therights of students andstaff infected with HIV(NASBE, 1989).School Policies on HIV/AIDS QuestionDoes this school or district have a written policy protecting therights of students and/or staff with HIV infection/AIDS? Question Are any of the following issues addressed in the written school ordistrict policy on students and/or staff with HIV infection/AIDS? Maintaining confidentiality of infected students and staff Confidential counseling for HIV infected studentsProcedures for implement- ing the policyAdequate training about HIV/AIDS for school staffCommunication of the policy to students, school staff, and parentsAttendance of students with HIV infection/AIDSProcedures to protect HIV- infected students and staff from discriminationWorksite safety 92% 58%69%75%84%89%91% 02 0 40 60 100 8034% 17%49% 020406080100 Yes No Don't Know 75%Part II-12 Principal 's Survey ResultsResults Forty-nine percent of the principals said that their schools or districts had a written policy protecting the rights of studentsand/or staff with HIV infection/AIDS. Seventeen percent of the principals indicated that there was no such policy while 34% did not know whether there was a policyfor their schools or districts. Of those principals who indicated that their schools or districts had an HIV policy, 91% said that the written policy addressedconfidentiality issues for infected students and staff. Recommendations Since nearly half of the principals surveyed had no HIV/AIDS policy or did not know whether they did, inservice training con-cerning HIV/AIDS policy should be provided to school adminis-trators. Models of effective policy used elsewhere in the nationand the state should provide a basis for such training. On-going support should be provided to school systems to ensure appropriate modifications to and implementation of HIV/AIDS policy.Topic 9 (continued) School Policies on HIV/AIDSPart II-13 Lead Health Educators Survey ResultsTopic 1 Rationale This question measures whether health educationis required in schools.The importance of healtheducation often isindicated by whether it isrequired in schools.

A documented,planned, and sequentialprogram of healtheducation for isa element schoolhealth implementation ofplanned curriculum waslinked directly to changesin students ' attitudes and behaviors (Cornell,Turner, and Mason,1985). Results Fifty-five percent of the lead health educators said that they were required to use the state curriculum guide; 90%, the districtcurriculum guidelines; and 53%, school curriculum guidelines inteaching health. Thirty-eight percent of the lead health educators said that they used a teacher 's guide to student textbooks to teach health. Only 33% reported using commercially developed health education curricula. Recommendations Since 90% of the lead health educators reported using the district curriculum guide for health education, efforts should be made tolink district curriculum with state curriculum frameworks. Teachers should become familiar with and incorporate the State of Alaska's \"Skills for a Healthy Life \" content standards into their teaching framework.Materials Used in Health Education QuestionAre teachers in this school required to use any of the followingmaterials in a required health education course(s) for students ingrades 6 through 12 in this school?

Thirty-eight percent of the lead health educators reported that educational materials were sent home to the parents. Fifty percent of the lead health educators said that parents were invited to attend health education class. Twenty percent reported that the school provided health education programs for the parents. Recommendations Health educators should continue to educate parents and guard- ians about all youth health issues and the importance of includingsuch issues in the curriculum. Parents/guardians should be involved in health education through curriculum planning and attending health education classes. Efforts to provide health education for parents via programs, newsletters, and other educational materials should be increased.Parental Participation in Health EducationPart II-21 Lead Health Educators Survey ResultsTopic 5 Rationale This question measures the extent to which healtheducation workscooperatively with othercomponents of the promotionfor and staff, andintegrated efforts ofschools and communitiesto improve health(Allensworth and Kolbe,1987).Question During this school year, have health education teachers in thisschool planned or coordinated health-related projects or activitieswith members of any of the following groups?

The lowest percent (11% or less) of lead health educators received inservice training in death and dying, environmentalhealth, community health, dental and oral health, chronic disease(such as diabetes and asthma), and consumer health. Lead health educators indicated a desire to receive at least one-half day of inservice training in these five topics: Suicide prevention, environmental health, dental and oral health,pregnancy prevention and community health. The three health topics least selected for training included first aid, conflict resolution (violence prevention), and death anddying. Recommendations Additional training in several key health topics such as sui- cide prevention, environmental health, consumer health,community health, emotional and mental health, pregnancyprevention, and disease prevention and control should beprovided to teachers. On-going training and support should be provided for teach- ers to teach human sexuality, alcohol and other drug preven-tion, conflict resolution/violence prevention, physical activityand fitness, and tobacco prevention.Inservice TrainingPart II-25 Lead Health Educators Survey ResultsTopic 7 Rationale These questions measure issues related to theimplementation of HIVeducation in schools.Results from the NationalYouth Risk BehaviorSurvey indicate that highschool students are at riskfor HIV infection (MMWR,Dec 18, 1992). The needfor effective HIV educationis recognized in nationalhealth objective 18.10,which calls for increasingto at least 95 percent theproportion of schools thathave age-appropriate HIVeducation curricula forstudents in 4 th to 12th grades, preferably as partof quality school healtheducation (U.S. PublicHealth Service, 1990).HIV/AIDS Education QuestionDo you teach about HIV infection/AIDS as part of a required healtheducation course(s) for students in any of grades 6 through 12 inthis school?

Approximately 80% of the lead health educators taught students about how HIV is and is not transmitted, behaviors thattransmit HIV, reasons for choosing abstinence, and how HIVaffects the immune system. Over 50% of the lead health educators taught about condom efficiency and 36% taught about the correct use of condoms. Fifty-seven percent of all lead health educators said that units or lessons on HIV infection/AIDS were integrated into othersubjects. About one third of the lead health educators indicated that parental concern made teaching about HIV infection/AIDSdifficult. Forty-two percent of the lead health educators indicated that inadequate teaching materials made teaching about HIVinfection/AIDS difficult. Recommendations Teachers should continue to receive inservice training in effective HIV/AIDS education.

Invited parents to attend class on HIV/AIDS Provided school programs on HIV/AIDS for parentsSent letters or newsletters on HIV/AIDS to parentsSent educational materials on HIV/AIDS to parents Results Only 24% of all lead health educators indicated that parents were invited to attend class on HIV/AIDS. Regarding communication with parents, 13% of lead health educators reported sending HIV education materials and 11%reported sending letters/newsletters to parents. Just 10% of lead health educators said that school programs on HIV/AIDS were provided for parents. Recommendations Parent involvement in HIV/AIDS education should be increased by multiple strategies.10%11%13%24% 0 2 04 06 08 01 0 066 34 020406080100 Yes No Part II-29 Lead Health Educators Survey ResultsTopic 9 Rational These questions measure the number oflead health educationteachers with healtheducation as theirprimary as aprimary responsibility(Butler, 1993).

Results Only 34% of the lead health education teachers reported that they were currently certified or endorsed by the state educationagency to teach health education. The ways in which lead health educators identified their primary role is as follows: 52% as other, 20% as a science teacher,15% as a health and physical education teacher, and only 7%as a health education teacher. When asked about their major emphasis of professional preparation, 25% said science, 23% other, 16% elementaryeducation, and 12% health and physical education.
