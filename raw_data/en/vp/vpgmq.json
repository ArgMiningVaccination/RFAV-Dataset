This formula contains USDA organic herbs herbs that assist the liver, kidneys and lymphatic system in removing toxins that can otherwise build up in the body promoting all sorts of disease conditions ranging from skin issues to more serious disease like cancer. We recommend providing the Detox Blend for two to four weeks at a time, 2 - 4 times per year when the body is showing signs of toxic build-up as displayed in the case of high liver enzymes or skin conditions, or as a seasonal cleanse to keep eliminating organs healthy. This formula uses USP organic glycerin, is alcohol-free and has been formulated specifically for animals by a certified Master Herbalist. How Does Detoxification Work? Metabolic cellular waste products are cleansed by lymphatic flow and filtered by lymph nodes where harmful organisms and debris are destroyed by specialized white blood cells called lymphocytes. Lymphatic fluid, or lymph, then enters the bloodstream where it is filtered and detoxified by the liver before traveling to the kidneys where nitrogenous waste products are filtered and excreted in urine, and regulation of many chemical substances occurs. Why is Detoxification Important for Dogs and Cats? Detoxification removes toxic substances and potentially harmful organisms from the body. Due to our very polluted environment and constant contact and ingestion of harmful substances whether from the food we eat, the water we drink or the chemicals applied to our pets (like topical flea and tick products) or used around the home, the body's detoxification system must work at peak efficiency to keep us healthy. When the body's systems become overwhelmed, harmful substances are not removed efficiently allowing them to build up in the body. This can show in issues such as digestive problems because of a congested liver, skin problems because of a congested lymphatic system, kidney damage because too many toxins are reaching the kidneys because the liver is not doing its job efficiently or cancer because toxins were allowed to build up in the body and damage cellular DNA. What to Look for in a Superior Detox Formula: Organic Herbs Our formula contains certified USDA organic herbs. Research shows organic herbs have higher amounts of important nutrients as opposed to conventionally raised plants. Organic farming methods are also better for the environment and of course do not have the levels of residual pesticides that conventionally grown herbs can have. We also do not use wild crafted herbs in our formulas as this practice can damage wild populations of herbs and you do not necessarily know where the herbs are coming from or have been grown. Instead, we prefer to be on the safe side and only obtain herbs from USDA certified organic farms. Natural Ingredients Natural ingredients are going to be gentler on your animal's body when compared to synthetic chemical ingredients or medications. The proper natural constituents are able to provide the body with what it needs to heal and get better. This is in direct contrast to synthetic ingredients or medications that can be especially hard on the liver and kidneys. Medications are also designed to have a symptom suppressing action in line with the principles of allopathic medicine which is to create a diagnoses and then use drugs to suppress symptoms. Using this course of action can never result in true healing and is not really meant to. Alcohol-Free Tincture with ORGANIC Vegetable Glycerin for Animals Our blend is formulated by a special process using low heat and organic vegetable glycerin. Tinctures are concentrated forms of a plant's constituents that are readily absorbed and utilized by your pet's body. Because your pet may not like the taste of alcohol, we use vegetable glycerin which gives our tinctures a sweet taste your animals will like. Vegetable glycerin is a carbohydrate but is metabolized differently than sugar and does not raise blood sugar levels. It is also an efficient menstruum which extracts valuable constituents from plants and makes them readily available to the body. In addition, we take the extra time and effort to use a low heat process that extracts many more constituents than just soaking in glycerin alone as is done by most other herbal companies. And, of course, the use of USDA organic vegetable glycerin ensures your pet avoids genetically modified ingredients and herbicides in their natural medicine. Uses only Human Grade Ingredients Our products are manufactured using human grade ingredients. In the pet industry this is far from the rule as many companies use pet quality ingredients, those considered \"not fit for human consumption\". Uses Fresh, High Quality Ingredients We purchase our ingredients from some of the most highly regarded companies in their respective fields so you and your animals are ensured the finest quality supplements. In addition, we purchase in small quantities to make sure the products we provide to you are fresh and bursting with important nutrients. This is in direct contrast to many other products on the market that can spend a year or longer sitting in non-climate controlled warehouses before they even get to you.

It is desirable to provide herbal remedies such as this away from meals for better absorption when possible. Shake well before use. Since this is not a medication, dosages do not have to be exact. Do the best you can to get as close to the suggested dosage below as you can for your animal's weight. |Pet Weight||Dosage| |0 - tsp)| Detox dosing schedule - You may provide two to three times daily. It may be prudent to start with one dose per day and see how your animal adjusts. You don't want detox symptoms to be too severe. Usual detox period is two to four weeks at a time, and can be done 2 - 4 times per year to keep detoxifying organs healthy and functioning properly. After this period you may continue with our [Liver Tonic](https://www.pethealthandnutritioncenter.com/liver-support-remedy-treatment.html) on a continual basis if you feel the liver needs more support for chronic issues. Provide access to plenty of fresh water and realize the need for urination may increase. Your dog or cat should eat and drink normally with a possibly softer stool than usual as toxins are eliminated. There may be some eye or nose discharge and the skin may become oily. These are all normal side effects of detoxification. If you experience watery stool or other unpleasant symptoms discontinue usage for a day or two and begin again at a lower dosage and build up to the suggested dosage over several days. To apply directly in mouth just pull out lower lip at back of mouth and squirt in desired amount. Don't tilt head back and squirt down throat or your pet may breathe some in. Wipe off dropper before placing back in container. If your animal coughs afterwards it is a sign they are breathing some in and it may be best to place in food in the future. How long does it usually take for this herbal remedy to work? Well, that is a difficult question to answer because each animal and his/her situation is unique. Sometimes benefits are seen immediately within a day or two and other times it may be a couple of weeks. We would say that you should see some sort of improvement within three to four weeks. If you don't see improvement please contact us in case we can make other suggestions - perhaps there is a more appropriate remedy etc. Remember, these are not pharmaceutical drugs that have a dramatic affect on the body. What we are trying to accomplish with our herbal remedies and other supplements is to increase the health of weak organs/systems and this can take a little time to accomplish in some cases. Also, please keep in mind that diet and lifestyle play a huge role in the health of your animal(s). If you continue to feed a poor-quality kibble diet or provide repetitive booster vaccinations or use flea/tick chemical products, these will work against what we are trying to accomplish and make it more difficult to improve the health of your dog or cat. What if my animal is not responding as hoped? Then you may increase the dosage by 50% and see how that works. Dosage can then be reduced at a later date. If they still do not respond as hoped then please do not just give up, instead contact us by email so we can consider your animal's condition and make further suggestions. Our goal is to succeed and we will help you to the best of our abilities. What if I have a large dog or I am on a budget? We understand that providing a large animal with herbal remedies and natural supplements can be a financial burden to some. We would suggest to provide what is within your budget and see how that works. For example, if you have a 100 lb dog that would require 5 mls two to three times daily, figure what is within your budget and try that. It may only be 1 ml or 2 mls two times per day. However, in our experience this is preferable to avoiding the remedy entirely. Do these herbal remedies have any contraindications? A contraindication suggests that a particular remedy should not be used in certain health conditions or along with certain medications. If any are present they will be indicated at the bottom of this page under Contraindications. Can I use this herbal remedy along with my pet's medication(s)? Generally, the answer to this question is \"yes\" with some caveats. As mentioned previously, if any contraindications are present they will be indicated at the bottom of this page. In addition, keep in mind that our herbal remedies often duplicate the actions of medications. For example, our heart tonic will help to dilate blood vessels and lower blood pressure mimicking the action of certain drugs used for heart failure or high blood pressure. If this is the case, then this should be discussed with your veterinarian as the dosage of the medication may need to be lowered or may even be eliminated entirely. This must be done working in coordination with your veterinarian - please do not take it upon yourself to remove your pet's medications. If using chemotherapy drugs please discuss this with your vet as well. What if my vet is not receptive to using natural supplements or herbal remedies? Well, this is a fairly common occurrence unfortunately. The decision will have to be yours on how to handle this. Try discussing with your vet how important it is to you to try a more natural approach. If this doesn't work and they are unreceptive then you have only two choices: do it their way or find a veterinarian that you can work with to better the health of your dog or cat. We know what we'd do! We recommend you purchase enough for at least 2 - 4 weeks to get an idea if this remedy will work for your animal. Use the chart below as a guide.
