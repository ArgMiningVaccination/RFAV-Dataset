Find out how Crystal Tomato can brighten your skin.", "sitename": "Eeva Medical Aesthetic Clinic", "date": "2021-05-03", "cleaned_text": "Reason #1: Pigmentation Reduction Crystal Tomato supplements are effective in treating a wide variety of pigmentation disorders. For instance, small dark spots, freckles removal, and melasma removal. A Singapore National Skin Centre study showed that almost 80% of patients suffering from melasma improved remarkably after just 56 days of taking Crystal Tomato. This result is very significant. Not many skin supplements proved to be efficacious after undergoing rigorous clinical trials by a recognized institution. Melasma is a chronic skin problem that causes dark, discoloured patches on the skin. What's more, it can have adverse effects on quality of life. Crystal Tomato originates from a specially cultivated variety of non-genetically modified white tomatoes. These tomatoes contain Crystal Tomato Carotenoids which are colourless. This active ingredient is scientifically proven to have skin whitening and brightening benefits. Carotenoids are naturally occurring substances synthesized by algae, plants, and photosynthetic bacteria. They are well known for their antioxidant properties. In particular, Crystal Tomato Carotenoids protect the skin from sun exposure and absorb UV while reducing pigmentation. They also inhibit formation of melanin and prevent pigmentation spots. Thus, Crystal Tomato is a safe and proven way to aid you on your [pigmentation removal](https://eevamedicalclinic.com/pigmentation-removal-treatment/) journey promoting even skin tone and a radiant complexion. Reason #2: Skin Whitening Crystal Tomato skin whitening supplement contains L-Cysteine, an important amino acid that helps your body to form Glutathione. Glutathione is a major antioxidant in the body. It helps in skin whitening, blemish prevention, freckles, age spots, and acne scars. More importantly, it converts dark brown melanin (the pigment responsible for producing dark spots) into pink melanin. This results in a skin whitening effect. Our bodies are not able to ingest Glutathione directly. Hence, we need to consume L - Cysteine as the key active ingredient. Since L - Cysteine is difficult to consume directly, we can get our daily dose through supplements like Crystal Tomato. L - Cysteine also keeps your cells healthy by removing heavy metals, toxins, and free radicals. The end result is brighter and fairer skin. The scientific evidence of the Crystal Tomato whitening effect is shown below.

As Singaporeans, we are susceptible to high levels of sun exposure. In turn, this may lead to DNA damage in skin cells, causing serious sunburn or skin cancer. Clinical studies showed that oral intake of Crystal Tomato Carotenoids protects and defends the skin against UV rays. Consuming them increased the natural SPF (sun protection factor) of the skin by 20%. This reduces DNA damage induced by UV rays, helping to preserve healthy and youthful skin. However, our skin pigmentation took many years to form. To be on the safe side, applying sunscreen is still essential to protect your skin from the sun. Taking Crystal Tomato will serve as a 2nd barrier of defence against UV damage. Reason #4: Anti-aging Earlier on in the article, we talked about L - Cysteine, and how it helps the body make more Glutathione. Glutathione is present in every cell of your body. Many call it the body's \"master antioxidant.\" It protects, repairs, and sends out signals to trigger a healing response whenever there are signs of damage. Without Glutathione, cells will die faster, leading to rapid ageing. Hence, it is helpful in fighting against the ageing process. With Glutathione, cells do rejuvenate at a faster rate which results in an anti-ageing effect. Also, L-Cysteine is US FDA-approved, providing an assurance that it is safe for consumption purposes in the long term. Reason #5: Super Antioxidant Crystal Tomato Carotenoids can absorb rays in the UVA/B range, thereby preventing the free radicals emitted by these UV rays. Free radicals are harmful atoms that can damage DNA, causing many illnesses associated with premature ageing. UVA and UVB rays are the main types of UV rays that cause skin damage, playing a big role in skin cancer formation. In reason #3, we also discussed how Crystal Tomato helps our bodies form more Glutathione, a \"master antioxidant\". Thus, Crystal Tomato is a powerful anti-oxidant that prevents free radical damage by environmental aggressors, prolonging cell DNA longevity. Taking Crystal Tomato in the long term improves your skin health and overall skin quality. What's next?
