[Cloning](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/Cloning) happens often in nature\u2014for example, when a cell replicates itself asexually without any [genetic](https://www.britannica.com/science/genetics) alteration or [recombination](https://www.britannica.com/science/recombination-genetics). [Prokaryotic](https://www.britannica.com/science/prokaryote) organisms (organisms lacking a cell [nucleus](https://www.britannica.com/science/nucleus-biology)) such as [bacteria](https://www.britannica.com/science/bacteria) create genetically identical duplicates of themselves using [binary fission](https://www.britannica.com/science/binary-fission) or [budding](https://www.britannica.com/science/budding-reproduction). In [eukaryotic](https://www.britannica.com/science/eukaryote) organisms (organisms possessing a cell nucleus) such as humans, all the cells that undergo [mitosis](https://www.britannica.com/science/mitosis), such as [skin](https://www.britannica.com/science/human-skin) cells and cells lining the [gastrointestinal tract](https://www.britannica.com/science/gastrointestinal-tract), are [clones](https://www.britannica.com/science/clone-genetics); the only exceptions are [gametes](https://www.britannica.com/science/gamete) ( [eggs](https://www.britannica.com/science/egg-biology) and [sperm](https://www.britannica.com/science/sperm)), which undergo [meiosis](https://www.britannica.com/science/meiosis-cytology) and genetic recombination. In biomedical research, cloning is broadly defined to mean the duplication of any kind of biological material for scientific study, such as a piece of [DNA](https://www.britannica.com/science/DNA) or an individual cell. For example, segments of DNA are replicated exponentially by a process known as [polymerase chain reaction](https://www.britannica.com/science/polymerase-chain-reaction), or PCR, a technique that is used widely in basic biological research. The type of cloning that is the focus of much [ethical](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethical) controversy involves the generation of cloned [embryos](https://www.britannica.com/science/embryo-human-and-animal), particularly those of humans, which are genetically identical to the organisms from which they are derived, and the subsequent use of these embryos for research, therapeutic, or reproductive purposes. Early cloning experiments Reproductive cloning was originally carried out by artificial \"twinning,\" or [embryo](https://www.britannica.com/science/embryo-human-and-animal) splitting, which was first performed on a [salamander](https://www.britannica.com/animal/salamander) embryo in the early 1900s by German embryologist [Hans Spemann](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hans-Spemann). Later, Spemann, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine (1935) for his research on embryonic development, theorized about another cloning procedure known as [nuclear transfer](https://www.britannica.com/science/nuclear-transfer). This procedure was performed in 1952 by American scientists Robert W. Briggs and Thomas J. King, who used DNA from embryonic cells of the [frog](https://www.britannica.com/animal/frog) Rana pipiens to generate [cloned](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/cloned) [tadpoles](https://www.britannica.com/science/tadpole). In 1958 British biologist [John Bertrand Gurdon](https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Gurdon) successfully carried out nuclear transfer using DNA from adult intestinal cells of African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis). Gurdon was awarded a share of the 2012 [Nobel Prize](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nobel-Prize) in Physiology or Medicine for this breakthrough. Advancements in the field of [molecular biology](https://www.britannica.com/science/molecular-biology) led to the development of techniques that allowed scientists to manipulate cells and to detect chemical markers that signal changes within cells. With the advent of [recombinant DNA technology](https://www.britannica.com/science/recombinant-DNA-technology) in the 1970s, it became possible for scientists to create transgenic clones\u2014clones with genomes containing pieces of DNA from other organisms. Beginning in the 1980s [mammals](https://www.britannica.com/animal/mammal) such as [sheep](https://www.britannica.com/animal/domesticated-sheep) were cloned from early and partially [differentiated](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/differentiated) embryonic cells. In 1996 British developmental biologist [Ian Wilmut](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ian-Wilmut) generated a cloned sheep, named [Dolly](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dolly-cloned-sheep), by means of nuclear transfer involving an enucleated embryo and a differentiated cell nucleus. This technique, which was later refined and became known as [somatic cell nuclear transfer](https://www.britannica.com/science/somatic-cell-nuclear-transfer) (SCNT), represented an extraordinary advance in the [science](https://www.britannica.com/science/science) of cloning, because it resulted in the creation of a genetically identical [clone](https://www.britannica.com/science/clone-genetics) of an already grown sheep. It also indicated that it was possible for the DNA in differentiated somatic (body) cells to revert to an undifferentiated embryonic stage, thereby reestablishing [pluripotency](https://www.britannica.com/science/pluripotent-cell)\u2014the potential of an embryonic cell to grow into any one of the numerous different types of mature body cells that make up a complete organism. The realization that the DNA of somatic cells could be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state significantly impacted research into [therapeutic](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/therapeutic) cloning and the development of [stem cell](https://www.britannica.com/science/stem-cell) therapies. Soon after the generation of Dolly, a number of other [animals](https://www.britannica.com/animal/animal) [horses](https://www.britannica.com/animal/horse), and birth of a viable SCNT [primate](https://www.britannica.com/animal/primate-mammal) clone would not come to fruition until 2018, and scientists used other cloning processes in the meantime. In 2001 a team of scientists cloned a [rhesus monkey](https://www.britannica.com/animal/rhesus-monkey) through a process called [embryonic cell nuclear transfer](https://www.britannica.com/science/embryonic-cell-nuclear-transfer), which is similar to SCNT except that it uses DNA from an undifferentiated embryo. In 2007 [macaque](https://www.britannica.com/animal/macaque) monkey embryos were cloned by SCNT, but those clones lived only to the [blastocyst](https://www.britannica.com/science/blastocyst) stage of embryonic development. It was more than 10 years later, after improvements to SCNT had been made, that scientists announced the [live birth](https://www.britannica.com/science/viviparity) of two [clones](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/clones) of the [crab-eating macaque](https://www.britannica.com/animal/crab-eating-macaque) (Macaca the first primate clones using the SCNT process. (SCNT has been carried out with very limited success in humans, in part because of problems with human egg cells resulting from the mother's age and environmental factors.) "}
