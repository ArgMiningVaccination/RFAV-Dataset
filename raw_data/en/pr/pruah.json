Davis, MD Chief Medical Officer and State Epidemiologist Bureau of Communicable Diseases and Emergency Response (BCDER) Division of Public Health Wisconsin Department of Health Services BCDER Spring Seminars June 10-12, 2014 Objectives 2 Describe the occurrence of HPV infections and their associated burden of disease among Wisconsin residents and other populations. Describe the efficacy, safety and importance of HPV vaccination to prevent HPV -associated cancers and other diseases. Describe the ACIP recommendations for HPV vaccination among males and females and how well we are doing with HPV vaccination in Wisconsin. Describe what is needed to improve HPV vaccination rates and reduce the burden of HPV related disease among Wisconsin residents. 3 Human papillomavirus (HPV) HPV infections HPV transmission Rapid acquisition of HPV infection after sexual debut Human papillomavirus (HPV) HPV infections are the most common sexually transmitted infections in the United States. Relationship of cervical cancer and sexual behavior suspected for >100 years. -1960s: established by epidemiologic studies. -1980s: cervical cancer cells demonstrated to contain HPV DNA. -1990s: results of numerous published studies consistently demonstrating association between HPV and cervical cancer. HPVs are small, double stranded DNA viruses. -Over 120 types identified: high risk (oncogenic) and low risk (non-oncogenic). -Differentiated by the genetic sequence of the outer capsid protein L1. -Most HPV types infect mucosal epithelium or skin: infection begins at the basal epithelium. 4 CDC Pink Book. Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine- Preventable Diseases. Atkinson W, et al., eds . 12th ed., second printing. Washington DC: Public Health Foundation, 2012. Laboratory diagnosis of HPV HPV has not been isolated in culture. HPV infection is diagnosed by detection of HPV DNA from clinical samples. -Variable sensitivity and type specificity. -Detection affected by specimen collection or anatomic site. Epidemiologic and research studies use nucleic acid amplification that generate type-specific results: wide array of HPV types can be detected. Current FDA -approved HPV DNA (nucleic acid hybridization) test detects 13 high-risk types: -HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68. -Results: positive or negative, not type-specific. Serologic tests (EIAs) are not standardized. 5 HPV types and disease association 6 Mona Saraiya, MD, MPH. Public Health Importance of HPV Infection and Disease. PowerPoint Presentation.

HPV transmission HPV: readily transmissible, infections are common -1 in 4 people in the United States (nearly 80 million) currently infected with >1 HPV types 14 million new infections annually in the United States -Almost all sexually active men and women will be infected with HPV at some point in their lives, even those with only one sexual partner HPV: modes of transmission -Direct contact (usually sexual) with an infected person -Can occur during any type of intimate sexual contact (including non- penetrative sexual activity) Small longitudinal study of adolescent females without prior vaginal intercourse: prevalence of vaginal HPV infection was 46% (10/22) -Non-sexual transmission of genital HPV uncommon: woman to newborn infant during birth HPV infection -Acquired shortly after becoming sexually active -Most common among persons in their early 20's 7 Accelerating HPV Vaccine Uptake: Urgency for Action to Prevent Cancer.

Turning HPV Vaccine Challenges into Opportunities. PowerPoint Presentation. June 26, 2013. Eliminate missed opportunities to vaccinate Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that increasing HPV vaccination rates from current levels to 80% would prevent: -An additional 53,000 future cervical cancer cases in the United States among girls who now are aged <12 years during the course of their lifetimes. -Thousands of other HPV-associated cancers in the United States would likely be prevented during the same timeframe. -A growing proportion of these cancers \u2014most notably, oropharyngeal cancers \u2014will occur among males, who currently are vaccinated at very low rates . 68 Accelerating HPV Vaccine Uptake: Urgency for Action to Prevent Cancer.

HPV infection prevention: Where to go from here 69 Prevent HPV -related cancers, cancer precursor lesions and genital warts Emphasize HPV vaccination as a standard and routine part of adolescent health care. Eliminate missed opportunities to vaccinate. -Take advantage of the adolescent immunization visit and every other potential visit. Do not delay vaccination. -Start the conversation regarding HPV vaccination during the first adolescent visit. Share a personal story and welcome questions from parents, especially about HPV vaccine safety. 70 71 http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/pcp/annualReports/HPV/index.htm Accelerating HPV Vaccine Uptake: Urgency for Action to Prevent Cancer A Report to the President of the United States from the President's Cancer Panel Current CDC activities to increase HPV vaccine coverage Communication and media campaign to public American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) funded activity to focus on provider outreach Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) awards to 11 State/local awardees to increase HPV vaccination State and local health department \"Call to Action\" with follow -up with health departments to discuss developing a plan Partnership building activities between immunization and cancer prevention programs and coalitions 72 Shannon Stokley . CDC PowerPoint Presentation. Improving HPV Vaccination Coverage: Recent Activities. February 18, 2014. What can you do to improve HPV vaccination coverage among adolescents in your area? Measure adolescent HPV immunization coverage rates in your county on a regular basis (e.g., quarterly). -Use the Wisconsin Immunization Registry (WIR) adolescent assessment and benchmark reports -Simple to run, measure HPV coverage rates in a few minutes Use the WIR reminder/recall functionality to generate list of persons due or overdue for HPV vaccination: for mailings or telephone reminders These are important evidence- based tools that can help improve HPV vaccination coverage. 73 What can you do to improve HPV vaccination coverage among adolescents in your area? (continued) Share county- level HPV immunization coverage levels with health care providers (HCPs) in your area. Encourage HCPs to assess HPV coverage rates within their own practices using the WIR adolescent reports. Promote the use of WIR reminder/recall functionality. -Refer questions to the WIR Help Desk, 608- 266-9691.
