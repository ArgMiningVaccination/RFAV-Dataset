The medicine men were priests, magicians and healers who handed down their knowledge and customs from one generation to the next. Medicine men were considered wealthy; receiving many gifts of money and wild life if a sick person they treated became well again. They were required to be masters at their craft, much like the doctors of today. Knowing every song, every word and ritual in perfect tune and order was essential for success. Everything had to be perfect and correct in order for it to work. The medicine man ultimately disappeared when \"during a forty year period ending in 1934, the us government forbade the tribal role: anyone attempting to serve as a medicine man was to be imprisoned for no less than ten days or until such time as he could produce evidence, satisfactory to the court, that he would forever abandon all such practices.\" (Dharmananda, 2000, P.3) Erika Lenis-Abril REL-337 5/10/2015 Native American Religion: Medicine and Spiritual Healing Native American traditional medicine and spiritual healing rituals go back for thousands of years, these traditions often focus on different variations of alternative medicine. This knowledge is passed on throughout generations, many of the tribes learn that by mixing natural plants such as herbs and roots they can make remedies with healing properties. It is believed that being healthy is when people reach a state of harmony not only spiritually, mentally but physically. To be able to overcome the forces that cause illness people must \"operate in the context of relationship to four constructs \u2014namely, spirituality (Creator, Mother Earth, Great Father); community (family, clan, tribe/nation); environment (daily life, nature, balance); and self (inner passions and peace, thoughts, and values)\" (Portman & Garret, 2006, p.453). In this research paper I am going to show evidence of the tremendous influence that Native American medicine and spiritual healing have over modern medicine in the course of healing \"Body Ritual Among the Nacirema\" Summary In the essay \"Body Ritual Among the Nacirema\", anthropologist Horace Miner depicts a group of people known as the \"Nacirema\", but is referring to Americans, whose cultural beliefs are deeply rooted in the perspective that the human body is prune to sickness and disfiguration. Consequently, Many traditional Native medicines and healing practices were discouraged with the advent of Western medicine, but now there is a movement to return to traditional ways (Zubek, 1994, p. 1924). Modern Western medicine treats the symptoms to cure a diseased state when the body is out of homeostasis. Native American healing traditions do this as well with herbs and plants suited to the purpose. These Native healing traditions also include sacred rituals, chants, and purification rites to help bring the spirit and mind of the afflicted back into balance. In effect, treating the whole person, not only the disease. A blending of these two healing practices could bring about better prognoses for today's patients.

Nicole Jones Folk Health Research Paper Appalachian Folk Remedies and Nursing Practices 12/2/16 Abstract Appalachian folk medicine is a system of healing made up of beliefs and practices that are transferred by oral tradition through families and communities. It was developed in response to a lack of access to modern medical care and combines homemade remedies with superstition and religious beliefs. A general definition of folk medicine is a collection of cures that are handed down by oral tradition and other similar means of heritage and are considered outside of mainstream medicine. Appalachian folk medicine sprung up from the need for health care. In pre-industrial Appalachia, doctors and modern medicine were rare and inaccessible as well as expensive, so people relied on traditional home remedies and superstitious practices to alleviate pain and to cure disease. Practices such as using turpentine and brown sugar to cure worms and the use of magnetism to stimulate the body to heal itself are common for many minor illnesses. The most common aspect of Appalachian folk medicine, however, is the widespread use of herbal and homemade medicines that are believed to have healing powers. It relies on local roots, flowers, fruits, bark, leaves, and seeds that could be gathered and then combined or treated to make them suitable for healing. Final Draft on Navajo Culture David Cable ANT 101 Introduction to Cultural Anthropology Prof. Justine Lemos July 19, 2012 I) Introduction: The Navajo Nation is the largest Native American group in America today, and is the biggest Indian reservation in the United States. Situated in the northeastern part of Arizona and in the northwestern part of New Mexico, it is comprised of nearly ten million acres, or roughly fifteen thousand square miles. In this research paper the author will discuss at least three aspects of the Navajo culture that will include the kinship that the Navajo have with each other, the social structure within Navajo society, the economic organization that sustains the culture and their beliefs and values that The Navajo Indians Mind, body and spirit are the foundation of the Navajo community. The Navajo culture is known to be very primitive and reserved. This could cause some complications in the health care field. Their basic lifestyle may lead to several health complications, belief in prayer and evil spirits is prominent, they believe that the role of a physician is to be a partner in their healing, there are several nursing practices that need to be considered when caring for a Navajo patient, and as a nurse it is important to treat these people with respect even if their ways may seems unorthodox. Advantages of Aboriginal Aboriginal medicines were based upon their beliefs, the healers and medicine men were reassuring and comforting members of the community since they could communicate with these spirits. Even though they were usually men and elders , The Navajo economy depended on two primary sources-agriculture learned from the pueblo peoples and livestock such as sheep, goats, and horses obtained initially form the Spaniards. Because the San Juan River was one of the few reliable sources of water in Navajo territory, during the summer months The Spaniards came into Navajo territory in the 1600's and once that occurred the Navajo indians set up trading posts. From those posts they traded cotton items such as blankets for meat and objects that could make resourceful weapons for them. The family life of Navajos made the traditions. Ceremonies and rituals are a big part of Navajo culture, ceremonies can last anywhere from nine days to just one day. There are many different types of ceremonies for this tribe, such as treatments for illness' physical and mental, nature related including building of the hogans, and the planting of Many different forms of medicine are currently practiced in the world. In fact, as our text states, \"in all cultures, some people have become recognized as having special abilities to treat and diagnose health problems.\" (Miller 107) Without argument, phytomedicinal and supernatural healers are two forms of medical treatment that have been around for longer than any other, regardless of culture. It has been estimated that shamanism has been practiced for over ten thousand years (Tyson 3). Native American and Celtic healers are often known as shamans. A specific person (or people) in each tribe are acknowledge as healers. They are usually taught from generation to generation. \"Healing does not follow written guidelines. Healers work differently with each person they help. They use their herbs, ceremony and power in the best way for each individual.\" (NLM) Ceremonies are a crucial part of the Native healing process, \"because physical and spiritual health are intimately connected, body and spirit must heal together. Traditional healing ceremonies promote wellness by reflecting Native conceptions of Spirit, Creator, and the Universe. They can include prayer, chants, drumming, songs, stories, and the use of a variety of sacred objects.\" (National Institute of Health) These ceremonies are considered very sacred. Non-Natives are allowed to come by invite only. As one can tell they are very cherished, spiritual, pious ceremonies and not just anyone can be a part of them.

The Chinese people believe that is someone has excess \"hot\" then they need to balance that with something \"cold.\" If someone is giving off a \"hot\" vibe then they need something like a cooling herbal tea, which will bring them back to a balance. In the Chinese culture, they also use herbal plants, such as, garlic, fresh ginger, and tree fungus because they believe these help to prevent illness (B. Nguyen, personal communication, January 15, 2011). The Hispanic cultures, like the Chinese, also believe in needing a balance between \"hot\" and \"cold\" (R. Marquez-Castro, personal communication, January 15, 2011). They classify diseases as \"hot\" or \"cold, and need to find ways to balance between these. Examples of \"hot\" diseases are hypertension, diabetes, and acid reflux. \"Cold\" diseases, for example, are pneumonia, and menstrual cramps. By maintaining a balance at all times, the people believe that they can avoid illness most of the time. In the Hispanic culture, there are beliefs of the \"evil eye.\" Turquoise is used to rid the \"evil eye\" which will protect their health, can stop harm from happening to them.
