Vickers, PhD Background: This chapter aims to differentiate between \"alternative\" therapies, often promoted falsely as viable options to mainstream lung cancer treatment, and complementary therapies, adjunctive, effective techniques that treat symptoms associated with cancer and its mainstream treatment, and to describe the evidence base for use of complementary therapies. Methods and design: A multidisciplinary panel of experts in oncology and integrative medicine evaluated the evidence for complementary (not alternative) therapies in the care of patients withlung cancer. Because few complementary modalities are geared to patients with only a single cancer diagnosis, symptom-control research conducted with other groups of patients with cancer was also included. Data on complementary therapies such as acupuncture, massage therapy,mind-body therapies, herbs and other botanicals, and exercise were evaluated. Recommenda-tions were based on the strength of evidence and the risk-to-benefit ratio.Results: Patients with lung and other poor-outlook cancers are particularly vulnerable to heavily promoted claims for unproved or disproved \"alternatives.\" Inquiring about patients' use of thesetherapies should be routine because these practices may be harmful and can delay or impair treatment. Mind-body modalities and massage therapy can reduce anxiety, mood disturbance, andchronic pain. Acupuncture assists the control of pain and other side effects and helps reduce levels ofpain medication required. Trials of acupuncture for chemotherapy-induced neuropathy and posttho-racotomy pain show promising results. Herbal products and other dietary supplements should beevaluated for side effects and potential interactions with chemotherapy and other medications.Conclusions: Complementary therapies have an increasingly important role in the control of symptoms associated with cancer and cancer treatment.

This is especially problematic inoncology, when delayed treatment can diminish thepossibility of remission and cure. 2Over time, some complementary therapies are proven safe and effec-tive. These become integrated into mainstream care,producing integrative oncology, a combination of thebest of mainstream cancer care and rational, data-based, adjunctive complementary therapies. 3 Most complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practices can be loosely grouped into fivecategories according to the National Institutes ofHealth (NIH) National Center for Complementaryand Alternative Medicine (Table 1). The therapies inthese categories are quite mixed; some are helpful,others are bogus. There is also considerable overlap among the categories. For example, traditional Chi- nese medicine uses biologically active botanicals andacupuncture. and manipulativecomponents and Ayurvedic principles in theory.Some interventions, such as music therapy, do not fiteasily into a category (Table 1). Most complementary therapies are not specific to a particular cancer diagnosis. Instead, they are usedtypically to treat symptoms shared by patients acrossmost cancer diagnoses. This is generally appropriatebecause symptoms tend to stem less from the pri-mary diagnosis than from involvement of a particularorgan or toxicities associated with treatment, whichevoke similar symptoms in patients across cancerdiagnoses. For example, bone metastases cause painregardless of whether the primary lesion was frombreast or prostate; chemotherapy-induced nauseaand vomiting are associated more closely with theemetogenic potency of the drug used than with theunderlying cancer diagnosis. In these guidelines, wesummarize data relevant to clinical problems en-countered by patients with lung cancer and make practical recommendations based on the strength ofthe evidence. The use of complementary therapies is common among cancer patients. \"Alternative therapies\" drawa far smaller percentage of patients but remain aserious problem. The difference between \"comple- mentary\" and \"alternative\" therapies is importantand essential to recognize. \"Alternative\" therapiesare typically promoted as literal, viable options forusein lieu of mainstream care. They are not. There are no viable \"alternatives\" to mainstream care. Instead, these are bogus products and regimens that drawpatients with unsubstantiated, often fanciful, claimsof easy cure. Typically they are unproven or dis-proved, invasive, and biologically active. Such \"alter-natives\" are heavily promoted to all patients with allcancer diagnoses, and patients with lung and otherpoor-outlook cancers are particularly vulnerable. The Society for Integrative Oncology and its MEDLINE-listed journal, formed by leading oncolo- gists and major cancer centers and organizations, de-liberately uses terminology meant to distinguish itselffrom purveyors of foolish therapies and bogus \"alter-natives,\" as well as to display quality research andappropriate application of useful, adjunctive comple-mentary modalities (www.IntegrativeOnc.org). This chapter includes minimal discussion of useless ap-proaches and recommends that readers obtain addi-tional information about them at www.mskcc.org/aboutherbs or www.quackwatch.org. Although the external validity of most clinical trials in adult oncology may be questioned because only asmall fraction of eligible patients participate, this is alesser problem in trials involving complementary therapies because they address symptom control and quality of life with noninvasive therapies that pro-duce few if any side effects. Patients generally aremore amenable to such studies. This chapter addresses complementary therapies, which are noninvasive adjuncts to mainstream care.Complementary therapies are applied not to treatlung cancer or any other malignancy but rather totreat the symptoms associated with cancer and itsmainstream treatments. This category also includesthe study of herbs and other botanicals. Clinical trialsof some herbs and other botanicals aside, few comple-mentary modalities are geared to patients with only asingle cancer diagnosis. Thus, symptom-control re- search conducted with other groups of cancer pa-tients is noted as well because these data are likely tohave broad applicability in lung cancer practice. Health-care professionals should be able to pro- vide evidence-based, patient-centered advice toguide patients to receive benefit while avoidingharm. A panel of experts in oncology and integrativemedicine was assembled to evaluate the current level of evidence regarding complementary (not alterna-tive) therapies relevant to the care of patients withlung cancer. Specific recommendations are madebased on the strength of evidence and the risks/benefit ratio. Table 1\u2014 Categories and Examples of Complementary and Alternative Therapies Biologically Based Practices Herbal remedies, vitamins, other dietary supplements Mind-body techniques Meditation, guided imagery Manipulative and body-based practicesMassage, reflexology Energy therapies Magnetic field therapyAncient medical systems Traditional Chinese medicine, ayurvedic medicine, acupuncture www.chestjournal.org CHEST / 13 2/3/ SEPTEMBER, 2007 SUPPLEMENT 341S Copyright \u00a9 2007 American College of Chest Physicians on March 12, 2009 www.chestjournal.org Downloaded from Because the use of CAMs by cancer patients is common, a strong recommendation is made to in- quire about the use of these therapies as a routinepart of the initial evaluation of lung cancer patients.Complementary therapies can be helpful in symp-tom control, whereas the use of alternative therapiescan delay or impair treatment. It is strongly recom- mended that guidance should be provided in an open, evidence-based, and patient-centered mannerby a qualified professional to those patients who useor who are interested in CAM so that they canapproach these therapies appropriately. Mind-body modalities are strongly recommended to be incorporated into a multidisciplinary approachin reducing anxiety, mood disturbance, or chronicpain in cancer patients. A strong recommendation ismade to consider massage therapy as part of amultimodality treatment approach in lung cancerpatients who experience anxiety or pain. Applicationof deep or intense pressure during massage therapyshould be avoided near cancer lesions or anatomicdistortions such as postoperative changes as well asin patients with a bleeding tendency (weak recom-mendation). Therapies based purely on the putativemanipulation of bioenergy fields or other nonrationalideas are considered bogus and are not recom-mended. Acupuncture is strongly recommended as a com- plementary therapy for pain control when pain is poorly controlled, when side effects from othermodalities are clinically significant, or when reducingthe amount of pain medicine becomes a clinical goal.Acupuncture is also strongly recommended as acomplementary therapy when nausea and vomitingassociated with chemotherapy are poorly controlledor when side effects from other modalities areclinically significant. Electrostimulation wristbandsshould not be used to reduce chemotherapy-inducednausea and vomiting because it appears to become aconditioned stimulus. The value of acupuncture intreating nicotine addition, dyspnea, or fatigue is notsupported by conclusive evidence. A trial 4of acu- puncture for chemotherapy induced neuropathy showed positive results. Acupuncture for postthora-cotomy pain is undergoing study. Given some re-ports of potential benefit, a trial of acupuncture isacceptable when symptoms are severe and not re-sponding adequately to other treatments. Acupunc- ture is generally safe when performed by qualified practitioners. Caution should be exercised in patientswith bleeding tendency. Taking dietary supplements can be beneficial in some circumstances and harmful in others. Supple-mentation of vitamin B12 and folic acid is required inpatients receiving pemetrexed treatment. A strongrecommendation is made for dietary supplementsused by patients, particularly herbal products, to be evaluated for side effects and potential interactionwith other drugs. Those that are likely to interactwith chemotherapeutic agents should not be usedduring chemotherapy. It is strongly recommended that patients be ad- vised to avoid the use of \"alternative\" therapies in lieuof mainstream care. Such practice can lead to significant harm to lung cancer patients because itdelays effective treatment and causes unpredictableadverse effects. Despite the long history of many complementary therapies, only a few have been evaluated with modern scientific research tools in a handful ofindications. A large gap exists between our currentlevel of scientific evidence and what we need toprovide evidence-based advice. More rigorous scien-tific research is being conducted to enrich ourknowledge base. Meanwhile, the risk-to-benefit ratioassociated with the strong recommendations noted isconsistent with good clinical care. In the context of adevastating diagnosis that most patients do not sur-vive, nontoxic complementary therapies can success-fully provide symptom relief to lung cancer patients. Detailed Methodology A multidisciplinary panel of experts in oncology was gathered to prepare this chapter. The teamincluded the following: thoracic medical oncologistJorge E. Gomez, MD, at Memorial Sloan-KetteringCancer Center (MSKCC); radiation oncologist andacupuncturist Peter A. S. Johnstone, MD, at Emory University School of Medicine; Gary E. Deng, MD,PhD, an internist MSKCC. Sources searched included English-language clin- ical trials or reviews in MEDLINE and relevantchapters in recent major oncology text books andgovernment Web sites. MEDLINE was searched forarticles published from 1980 to 2006. These searcheswere conducted from December 2005 through April 2006. Limitations: Gaps in Research Despite the long history of most complementary modalities, rigorous scientific research on these ther- apies is a recent phenomenon. The research is 342S Diagnosis and Management of Lung Cancer: ACCP Guidelines Copyright \u00a9 2007 American College of Chest Physicians on March 12, 2009 www.chestjournal.org Downloaded from further limited by lack of sufficient funding, lack of qualified investigators, and methodologic and eth-ical issues unique to studying complementary ther-apies. Therefore, gaps in research are the norm rather than the exception in this field, and these gapsrepresent the major limitation. Many complemen-tary therapies derived from complete traditional medical system were used historically to treat almost every ailment. Only a few modalities have been evalu- ated with modern scientific research tools in a fewindications. Those data related to lung cancer arediscussed in this article. Our current knowledge baseis simply insufficient. A tremendous amount of workneeds to be performed before we can offer morecomprehensive evidence-based recommendations. Integrative medicine evaluated the evidence for complementary (not alternative) therapies in thecare of lung cancer patients. Because few comple-mentary modalities are geared to patients with only asingle cancer diagnosis, symptom-control researchconducted with other groups of cancer patients wasalso included. Data on complementary therapiessuch as acupuncture, massage therapy, mind-bodytherapies, herbs and other botanicals, and exercisewere evaluated. Recommendations were based onthe strength of evidence and the risk-to-benefit ratio. Recommendations and Discussion The recommendations are organized according to modalities. Within each modality, recommendations supported by a strong level of evidence are made anddiscussed first (grade A and B). Recommendationsare presented in text boxes for easy recognition.Selected topics where only grade C recommenda-tions can be made are then discussed. These topicsare selected based on their clinical significance. Suchselectiveness is necessary because of the nascentnature of research in this area. For many issuesrelevant to lung cancer patients, there is currentlyinsufficient evidence to make any meaningful recom-mendation. For other issues, relevant but not exclu-sive to lung cancer, existing data from other cancerdiagnoses can be safely extrapolated. Use of CAM Recommendation 1. It is recommended that all patients with lung cancer be asked specifically about the use of CAM. Grade of recommendation, 1C Rationale and Evidence: The most comprehensive and reliable findings on Americans' use of CAM ingeneral come from the National Center for Health Statistics 2002 National Health Interview Survey.The National Center for Health Statistics is anagency of the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention. 5Of 31,044 adults surveyed, 75% used some form of CAM. When prayer specifically forhealth reasons is excluded, the percentage is 50%. By various accounts, 10% to /H1102260% of cancer patients have used CAM, depending primarily on thedefinitions applied. 6-10The Datamonitor 2002 Sur- vey indicated that 80% of cancer patients used analternative or complementary modality. 11There is some indication of a growth in CAM use by cancerpatients in recent years. 12When compared to other cancer diagnoses, prevalence of CAM use was thehighest in lung cancer patients (53%) according to anationwide survey in Japan. 13This is not the case in a Europe-wide survey, in which 24% of lung cancerpatients reported CAM use. 14Consistent across all surveys, CAM users typically are younger, moreeducated, and more affluent, representing a morehealth-conscious segment of the population who arewilling and able to play an active role in their owncare. Recommendation 2. It is recommended that all patients with lung cancer be given guidance about the advan- tages and disadvantages of complementarytherapies in an open, evidence-based, and pa-tient-centered manner by a qualified profes-sional. Grade of recommendation, 1C Rationale and Evidence: Surveys show that most cancer patients rely on friends and family members,the media, and the Internet, rather than health-careprofessionals as top sources of CAM information. 13,14 Information obtained from these nonprofessional sources is often inaccurate. A majority of patientsused botanicals or other supplements, expectingthem to suppress the growth of cancer or even curecancer, 13,14not realizing that most such effects come from in vitro or animal studies. There has been little evidence to date showing any CAM therapies canachieve those effects in clinical settings. Many sup-plements are often produced with minimal if anyquality control. 15They may interact with many pre- scription medications, including chemotherapy, pos-sibly decreasing efficacy or increasing toxicity. 16,17 Some patients use dietary supplements nondiscrimi-natorily for possible benefits in cancer preventionand cancer treatment. However, some supplementsmay do more harm than good ( eg, supplementation of beta-carotene may actually increase the risk of www.chestjournal.org CHEST / 13 2/3/ SEPTEMBER, 2007 SUPPLEMENT 343S Copyright \u00a9 2007 American College of Chest Physicians on March 12, 2009 www.chestjournal.org Downloaded from lung cancer in those who currently smoke and in those who recently quit smoking).18,19 However, therapies backed by supportive evidence for symp-tom control and favorable risk/benefit ratios, such asacupuncture and mind-body techniques, were usedless frequently than were botanicals. 13,14 Two further barriers that hinder open communi- cation on CAM use are the perceived lack of famil-iarity with CAM modalities and the widespreaddismissive attitude among mainstream health-careprofessionals. Medical degree courses rarely includereview of common CAM therapies, and many phy-sicians who provide care to cancer patients are unable to discuss these approaches in an open, patient-centered fashion. Increasing numbers of ed-ucational resources, including review articles, books,continuing medical education courses, and reliableWeb sites, are available to interested physicians,nurses, and other practitioners. Major cancer centers in North America and else- where have established integrative medicine pro-grams to study and combine helpful complementarytherapies with mainstream oncology care, while ed-ucating cancer patients to avoid potentially harmful\"alternative\" therapies and herb-drug interactions.They are valuable and yet underutilized resourcesfor busy oncologists who may not have the time foran in-depth discussion with patients on CAM. Aninternational organization has been established toencourage appropriate clinical integration and scien-tific evaluation and dissemination of evidence-basedinformation (Society for Integrative Oncology, http://www.integrativeonc.org). Mind-Body Techniques Recommendation 3. In lung cancer patients, mind-body modal- ities are recommended as part of a multidisci- plinary approach to reduce anxiety, mooddisturbance, or chronic pain. of recom- mendation, 1B cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeedback,and guided imagery are increasingly becoming partof mainstream care over the years. A survey foundthat 19% of American adults used at least onemind-body therapy in a 1-year period. 20The 2002 US nationwide survey5showed 12% of the respon- dents used deep breathing relaxation techniques and 8% used meditation. A metaanalysis21of 116 studies found that mind-body therapies could reduce anxi-ety, depression, and mood disturbance in cancer patients, and assist their coping skills. Mind-bodytechniques also may help reduce chronic low backpain, joint pain, headache, and procedural pain. 22 Meditation: Meditation focuses attention on in- creasing mental awareness and clarity of mind (con- centrative meditation) or opens attention to what-ever goes through the mind and to the flow ofsensations experienced from moment to moment(mindfulness meditation). In a randomized wait-listcontrol study 23of 109 cancer patients, participation in a 7-week mindfulness-based stress reduction pro-gram was associated with significant improvement inmood disturbance and symptoms of stress. A single-arm study 24of patients with breast and prostate cancer showed significant improvement in overallquality of life, stress, and sleep quality, but symptomimprovement was not significantly correlated withprogram attendance or minutes of home practice. Yoga: Yoga, which combines physical movement, breath control, and meditation, improved sleep qual- ity in a trial of 39 patients with lymphoma. Practicinga form of yoga that incorporates controlled breathingand visualization significantly decreased sleep distur-bance when compared to wait-list control subjects. 25 Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques must be practiced to produce beneficial effects.26 Hypnosis: Hypnosis is an artificially induced state of consciousness in which a person is highly receptive tosuggestions. A trancelike state (similar to deep day-dreaming) can be achieved by first inducing relaxationand then directing attention to specific thoughts orobjects. For best results, the patient and the therapistmust have a good rapport with a level of trust; the environment must be comfortable and free from dis- tractions; and the patient must be willing to undergothe process and must desire to be hypnotized. Researchshows that hypnosis is beneficial in reducing pain,anxiety, phobias, and nausea and vomiting. In one study, 20 patients who underwent exci- sional breast biopsy were randomly assigned to ahypnosis or control group (standard care). Postsur-gery pain and distress were reduced in the hypnosisgroup. 27In another study, children undergoing mul- tiple painful procedures such as bone marrow aspi- ration or lumbar puncture were randomized to re-ceive hypnosis, a package of cognitive behavioralcoping skills, or no intervention. Those who receivedeither hypnosis or cognitive behavioral therapy ex-perienced more pain relief than did control patients. The effects were similar between hypnosis and cog- nitive behavioral therapy. Both therapies also re-duced anxiety and distress, with hypnosis showing 344S Diagnosis and Management of Lung Cancer: ACCP Guidelines Copyright \u00a9 2007 American College of Chest Physicians on March 12, 2009 www.chestjournal.org Downloaded from greater effectiveness.28Hypnosis was studied in a randomized controlled trial29of 60 patients under- going elective plastic surgery. Perioperative and postoperative anxiety and pain were significantlyreduced in the hypnosis group when compared tothe control group who just received stress reductiontraining. Reduction in anxiety and pain was achievedalong with significant reduction in intraoperative requirements for sedatives and analgesics. 29 In a study30of 67 patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation, subjects were randomized to one of the four intervention groups: hypnosis train-ing, cognitive behavioral coping skills training, therapistcontact control, or usual care. Oral pain from mucosi- tis was reduced in the hypnosis group. An NIHTechnology Assessment Panel found strong evidence for hypnosis in alleviating cancer-related pain. 31 Hypnosis effectively treats anticipatory nausea in pediatric32and adult cancer patients33and reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting.29 Selection of proper patients and qualifications of the hypnotherapist contribute to safe hypnother-apy. A small percentage of patients may experi-ence dizziness, nausea, or headache. These symp-toms usually result from patients being broughtout of trances by inexperienced hypnotherapists. Relaxation Techniques: Relaxation techniques were shown in randomized controlled trials to ameliorate anxiety and distress significantly. A randomized study ofrelaxation therapy vs alprazolam showed that both approaches significantly decreased anxiety and de-pression, although the effect of alprazolam was slightlyquicker for anxiety and stronger for depressive symp-toms. 34Relaxation achieves the effect without side effects and at a lower cost. A randomized trial35of 82 radiation therapy patients found significant reductions in tension, depression, anger, and fatigue for those whoreceived relaxation training or imagery. A metaanalysis 36of 59 studies showed improved sleep induction and maintenance with psychologicalinterventions. Although pharmaceuticals may pro-duce a rapid response, some studies suggest thatbehavioral therapies help to maintain longer-termimprovement in sleep quality. The NIH consensuspanel 31concluded that behavioral techniques, par- ticularly relaxation and biofeedback, produce im-provements in some aspects of sleep, but the mag-nitude of improvement in sleep onset and time maynot achieve clinical significance. Manipulative and Body-Based Practices Recommendations 4. In lung cancer patients experiencing anxi- ety or pain, massage therapy delivered by amassage therapist trained in oncology is recom- mended as part of a multimodality treatmentapproach. Grade of recommendation, 1C 5. The application of deep or intense pressure is not recommended near cancer lesions oranatomic distortions such as postoperativechanges, as well as in patients with a bleedingtendency. Grade of recommendation, 2C Rationale and Evidence: The many types of body- based practices have in common the manipulationor movement of parts of the body to achieve healthbenefits. Massage therapists apply pressure tomuscle and connective tissue to reduce tensionand pain, improve circulation, and encourage re-laxation. Massage therapy has variations in tech-niques, such as Swedish massage, Thai massage,and Shiatsu. Other body-work techniques, such asAlexander Technique and Pilates, address postureand movement, whereas yoga, Tai Chi, Reiki, andpolarity therapy incorporate strong mind-bodycomponents. 37 Massage therapy helps relieve symptoms com- monly experienced by cancer patients. It reducesanxiety and pain 38-41 as well as fatigue and dis- tress.38Anxiety and pain were evaluated in a crossover study39of 23 inpatients with breast or lung cancer receiving reflexology (foot massage) orusual care. Patients experienced significant de-creases in anxiety; in one of three pain measures,breast cancer patients experienced significant de-creases in pain as well. 39In the largest study40to date, 87 hospitalized cancer patients were ran-domized to receive foot massage or control. Painand anxiety scores decreased with massage, withdifferences between groups achieving statisticaland clinical significance. The use of aromatic oilseemed to enhance the effect of massage in earlystudies, 41,42 but significant enhancement was not seen in more recent randomized controlled tri-als. 43-45 For noncancer subacute and chronic back pain, massage therapy was found effective in a systematic review of randomized controlled trials,and preliminary data suggest it may help reducethe costs of care. 46 Massage therapy is generally safe when practiced by credentialed practitioners. Serious adverse eventsare rare and associated with exotic types of massageor untrained practitioners. 47In work with cancer patients, the application of deep or intense pressureshould be avoided, especially near lesions or ana-tomic distortions such as postoperative changes.Patients with bleeding tendencies should receiveonly gentle, light-touch massage. www.chestjournal.org CHEST / 13 2/3/ SEPTEMBER, 2007 SUPPLEMENT 345S Copyright \u00a9 2007 American College of Chest Physicians on March 12, 2009 www.chestjournal.org Downloaded from Energy Therapies Recommendation 6. For lung cancer patients, therapies based on manipulation of putative bioenergy fields are not recommended. Grade of recommendation, 1C Rationale and Evidence: Energy therapies are based on the theory that manipulation of \"energy fields\" around a patient has therapeutic value. Twotypes of energy fields are involved: biofield andelectromagnetic field. Biofield therapies are intended to affect energy fields that purportedly surround and penetrate thehuman body. Because no convincing scientific evi-dence has emerged despite decades of attempt toprove the existence of such fields, some of thetherapies, although originally developed from thetheory of bioenergy fields, likely exert their effectson patients through light touch or mind-body inter-action. Such therapies include Qi-gong, Reiki, andtherapeutic touch. This type of therapy is reviewedin the \"Mind-Body Techniques\" section. Bioelectromagnetic-based therapies involve the unconventional use of electromagnetic fields, such aspulsed fields, magnetic fields, or alternating-currentfields or direct-current fields. Most research in bio-electromagnetics focuses on genotoxicity of environ- mental electromagnetic fields, such as whether ex-posure to power lines or cell phones increases therisk of cancer. 48-50 There has been no report show- ing the bioelectromagnetic therapies to be effective in cancer treatment or symptom control. Acupuncture Acupuncture is a modality that originated from traditional Chinese medicine. The theory was that one can regulate the flow of \"Qi\" (vital energy) by the stimulation of certain points on the body with nee- dles, heat, or pressure. Scientific research51,52 sug- gests that the effects of acupuncture are likely mediated by the nervous system. Release of neuro-transmitters and change of brain-functional MRIsignals are observed during acupuncture. Acupunc-ture was used traditionally for almost every ailment;few such applications are supported by rigorous clinical studies. However, evidence supports the use of acupuncture in treating some common symptomsexperienced by cancer patients and others. Recommendation 7. Acupuncture is recommended as a comple- mentary therapy when pain is poorly controlledor when side effects such as neuropathy or xerostomia from other modalities are clinicallysignificant. Grade of recommendation, 1A Rationale and Evidence: Pain is the most com- mon and the best-studied indication for acupunc-ture. Acupuncture relieves both acute ( eg, postop- erative dental pain) and chronic ( eg, headache) pain. 53,54 An NIH consensus statement53in 1997 supported acupuncture for adult postoperative pain, chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting,and postoperative dental pain. Insufficient evi-dence was available to support other claims ofefficacy at that time; but in the ensuing years,many publications have documented the utility of acupuncture as an adjunct treatment for pain, emesis, and other symptoms. A randomized controlled trial 55of 570 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee found that a 26-week course of acupuncture significantly improved painand dysfunction when compared to sham acupunc-ture control. In this study, all patients received otherusual care for osteoarthritis. At 8 weeks, both painand function improved, but the difference between groups was significant only for function. 55A compan- ion article56reported the results of a randomized controlled trial of acupuncture for chronic mechan- ical neck pain. Acupuncture was found to reduceneck pain and produce a statistically, but not clini-cally, significant effect compared with placebo. Dataon acute low back pain are inconclusive. 57 Acupuncture appears effective against cancer- related pain. A randomized placebo-controlledtrial 58tested auricular acupuncture for patients with pain despite stable medication. A total of 90 patientswere randomized to have needles placed at correctacupuncture points (treatment group) vs acupunc-ture or pressure at nonacupuncture points. Painintensity decreased by 36% at 2 months from base-line in the treatment group, a statistically significant difference compared with the two control groups, for whom little pain reduction was seen. 58Skin penetra- tion per se showed no significant analgesic effect. The authors selected acupuncture points by measur- ing electrodermal signals. These results are espe-cially important because most of the patients hadneuropathic pain, which is often refractory to con-ventional treatment. Brain imaging technology is now being used to examine the specific nervous pathways involved in acupuncture. In functional MRI studies, true acu-puncture induces brain activation in the hypothal-amus and nucleus accumbens, and deactivatesareas of the anterior cingulate amygdala,and hippocampus. Such changes are not observedin control stimulations, which affect only sensory 346S Diagnosis and Management of Lung Cancer: ACCP Guidelines Copyright \u00a9 2007 American College of Chest Physicians on March 12, 2009 www.chestjournal.org Downloaded from cortex change. Deactivation of the amygdala and hippocampus has been observed also with elec-troacupuncture. These data suggest that acupunc-ture modulates the affective-cognitive aspect ofpain perception. 52Correlations between signal intensities and analgesic effects also have beenreported. 59 Recommendations 8. Acupuncture is recommended as a comple- mentary therapy when nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy are poorly con-trolled. Grade of recommendation, 1B 9. Electrostimulation wristbands are not rec- ommended for nausea vomiting. Grade of recommen- dation, 1B Rationale and Evidence: Acupuncture helps lessen chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. 60In one study,61104 breast cancer patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy were randomizedto receive electroacupuncture at the PC6 and ST36acupuncture points, minimal needling at nonacu-puncture points, or pharmacotherapy alone. Elec-troacupuncture significantly reduced the number ofepisodes of total emesis from a median of 15 to 5 when compared with pharmacotherapy only. Most patients did not know the group to which they had been assigned. 61The effects of acupuncture do not appear entirely because of attention, clinician- patient interaction, or placebo. The combination of acupuncture and serotonin receptor antagonists, the newest generation of antiemetics, showed mixed results. In a trial62of patients with rheumatic disease, the combinationdecreased the severity of nausea and the numberof vomiting episodes more than ondansetron alonein patients receiving methotrexate (an agent alsoused in chemotherapy). study patients receiving high-dose chemotherapyand autologous stem-cell ondansetron plus placebo acupunc-ture. Acupuncture also caused by pregnancy, 64surgery,65and motion sickness.66,67 Acupressure wristbands that render continuous stimulation of the PC6 point also have been testedfor chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting. In arandomized controlled trial 68of 739 patients, nausea on the day of chemotherapy was reduced signifi-cantly in patients wearing wristbands compared withno-band control subjects. No significant differenceswere found for delayed nausea or vomiting. Unlike acupressure wristbands, expected efficacy of electro-stimulation wristbands was not significantly relatedto any component of nausea or to antiemetic use. Itwas believed that the electrical stimulus generatedby the electrostimulation band could act as a condi-tioned stimulus (akin to a reminder) of the nauseathat patients are trying to control, and therebyactually accentuate the development of nausea insome individuals. 68 Recommendation 10. When the patient with lung cancer does not stop smoking despite use of other options, a trial of acupuncture is recommended to assist insmoking cessation. Grade of recommendation, 2C Rationale and Evidence: Smoking cessation has the largest impact in preventing lung cancer. Edu- cational, behavioral, and medical interventions arethe mainstay for smoking cessation. The effect ofacupuncture has been studied with mixed results. Ametaanalysis 69of 22 studies concluded that acupunc- ture is no more effective than placebo in smoking cessation; however, the same metaanalysis found thatacupuncture did no worse than any other interven-tion. A more recent randomized trial 70of 141 sub- jects tested auricular acupuncture, education, or thecombination in achieving smoking cessation. Theauthors found that both modalities, alone or incombination, significantly reduced smoking. Thecombination showed a significantly greater effect insubjects with a greater pack-year history. 70 Brain imaging studies show that smoking sup- presses blood flow to anterior cingulate cortex, hip-pocampus, and amygdala. 71Curiously, these are the same areas suppressed by acupuncture.52Given the huge public health impact of smoking and the imper- fect results of existing smoking cessation techniques,it is acceptable, although not encouraged, for some-one who has been unable to quit smoking to tryacupuncture. Further studies using refined acupunc-ture techniques guided by recent advances in acu- puncture research appear warranted. Recommendation 11. In patients with lung cancer with symp- toms such as dyspnea, fatigue, chemotherapy- induced neuropathy, or postthoracotomy pain,a trial of acupuncture is recommended. Grade of recommendation, 2C Rationale and Evidence: Lung cancer patients with advanced disease almost always experience www.chestjournal.org CHEST / 13 2/3/ SEPTEMBER, 2007 SUPPLEMENT 347S Copyright \u00a9 2007 American College of Chest Physicians on March 12, 2009 www.chestjournal.org Downloaded from dyspnea attributable to parenchymal tumor burden or pleural effusion. Oxygen and opioids remain themainstay of symptomatic treatment, although confu-sion and constipation are common side effects. Anuncontrolled study 72in cancer patients receiving palliative care showed marked reduction of dyspneascores after a session of acupuncture. However,subsequent randomized, sham, controlled trials 73did not show significant improvement in subjective sen-sation of dyspnea in patients with advanced lung orbreast cancer. Fatigue after chemotherapy or irradiation, another major and common problem, has few reliable treat-ments in patients without a correctable cause such asanemia. 74In an uncontrolled trial75of fatigue after chemotherapy, acupuncture reduced fatigue 31%after 6 weeks of treatment. Among those with severefatigue at baseline, 79% had nonsevere fatigue scoresat follow-up, 75whereas fatigue was reduced only in 24% of patients receiving usual care in anothercenter. 76 Although acupuncture is commonly used to treat neuropathy, most previous research was performedin HIV-related neuropathy or diabetic neuropathy.Patients with HIV-related peripheral neuropathywere treated with standardized acupuncture regimenor control point regimen in a randomized controlledtrial 77of 239 patients. Reduction of pain scores was observed in both groups, and no significant differ-ence between the groups was seen. Forty-six diabeticpatients with chronic painful peripheral neuropathywere treated with acupuncture in a single-arm study.Significant improvement of symptoms was re-ported by 77% of patients, a percentage higher than the usual response to placebo observed in pain trials. There was no significant change in theperipheral neurologic examination scores. 78No clinical trial of acupuncture for chemotherapy- induced neuropathy has been reported, although arecent small case series 4showed positive results. A randomized clinical trial to evaluate acupuncturein the treatment of postthoracotomy neuropathicpain is underway. If these symptoms become a significant clinical problem in a particular patient despite conventionaltreatment, it is not unreasonable to accept a patient's choice to try acupuncture for symptom reduction. The lack of conclusive evidence supporting its effec-tiveness is balanced to the favorable safety record ofacupuncture and the lack of other viable treatmentoptions. Recommendation 12. In patients with a bleeding tendency, it is recommended that acupuncture be performedby qualified practitioners and used cautiously. Grade of recommendation, 1C Rationale and Evidence: Acupuncture needles are regulated as medical device in the United States.They are filiform, sterile, single use, and very thin(28 to 40 gauge). Insertion of acupuncture needlescauses minimal or no pain and less tissue injury thanphlebotomy or parenteral injection. Acupunctureperformed by experienced, well-trained practitionersis safe. Only six cases of potentially serious adverse events were reported in a recent study of 97,733patients receiving acupuncture in Germany. Theyincluded exacerbation of depression, hypertensivecrisis, vasovagal reaction, asthma attack, and pneu-mothorax. The most common minor adverse eventsincluded local bleeding and needling pain, both in/H110210.05% of patients. 79It is prudent to avoid acu- puncture at the site of tumor or metastasis, limbs with lymphedema, areas with considerable anatomicdistortion attributable to surgery, and in patientswith thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, or neutrope-nia. Cancer patients require certified practitionerswho are experienced in treating patients with malig- nant diseases. Diet and Dietary Supplements Including Herbal Products Many epidemiology studies demonstrate an as- sociation of diet and cancer incidence. Other than smoking cessation, a healthy diet is perhaps themost important lifestyle change a person can maketo help prevent cancer, as well as cardiovasculardisease and diabetes. However, aside from inter-ventions to counter specific protein, calorie, vita-min, or mineral nutritional deficits, special dietaryregimens do not have any significant role in cancertreatment. Some dietary regimens have been pro-moted for cancer treatment, such as macrobioticdiet or alkaline diet. None has been supported byclinical studies. The use of biological-based CAM such as herbs and other dietary supplements is very popular amongcancer patients. 13,14,80 Most users expect the supple- ments to help cancer treatment or reduce side effects. Such expectations are often unmet.14The purported benefits of the supplements are usuallyonly supported by preclinical studies. Only a fewwere evaluated in clinical trials. The concurrent useof supplements, especially high-dose antioxidants orcomplex botanical agents, during chemotherapy orradiation therapy can be problematic because of drug-supplement interaction. 81,82 Some botanicals, based on their chemical structure, may have adverse effects in perioperative use. Their antiplatelet ac- 348S Diagnosis and Management of Lung Cancer: ACCP Guidelines Copyright \u00a9 2007 American College of Chest Physicians on March 12, 2009 www.chestjournal.org Downloaded from tivity may adversely interact with corticosteroids and CNS depressant drugs; may produce GIeffects, adul- teration of dietary supplements are additionalmajor issues. 84 Recommendations 13. It is recommended that dietary supple- ments, in particular herbal products, be evalu-ated for side effects and potential interactionwith other drugs. Those that are likely to inter-act with other drugs, such as chemotherapeuticagents, should not be used concurrently during chemotherapy or radiation, or before surgery.Grade of recommendation, 1B 14. In lung cancer patients who either do not respond to or decline antitumor therapies, it isrecommended use of botanical agents occuronly in the context of clinical trials. Grade of recommendation, 1C Rationale and Evidence: Dietary supplements in- clude vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals,amino acids, and other substances intended to sup-plement the diet. They are usually natural productswith a record of historical use. By law, the manufac-turers are not allowed to claim that their product willdiagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease.However, patients often take them with such expec-tations. Botanicals and other natural products are a valu- able source for the development of therapeuticagents, where they are carefully studied for safetyand efficacy. Approximately one fourth of prescrip-tion drugs contain active ingredients derived from plants, including supplements, however, they are rarelyproduced to the same high standards. Some herbscause significant side effects. Detrimental herb-druginteractions may occur. Finally, product inconsistencyand contamination have been reported. 84,85 Most claims made by producers of herbal supple- ments are based on historical experience, uncon- firmed by clinical trials. Many herbs show directantitumor activity in in vitro or animal experi- ments, 86,87 but translating preclinical to clinical use often fails because the active constituents, oftenunknown, are insufficiently potent or metabolizedbefore reaching their target. The composition ofherbs is complex and typically containing hundredsof constituents. Moreover, some herbal remedies function through the synergistic effects of theirmultiple constituents, hindering identification of ac-tive components. Herbs and other botanical products that enhance immune function are especially popular among can-cer patients and may prove useful in cancer treat-ment or prevention. Some show immunomodulatoryeffects in preclinical studies, assisting tumor rejec-tion or resistance to pathogens. 88-90 However, the most popular immune boosting herb in the United States used commonly to treat colds, echinacea,showed disappointing results in randomized con-trolled trials. 91-93 Because botanicals contain biologically active con- stituents, they carry health risks if not used properly.The botanical kava kava, for example, proved moreeffective than placebo in treating anxiety, stress, andinsomnia, 94,95and it was considered a viable alterna- tive to benzodiazepines because of its benefits andabsence of dependency and addiction. However,later reports associate this herbal remedy with severehepatotoxicity resulting in death. 96 Herbal medicine was practiced historically by those with at least some knowledge of side effects ofthe herbs. Today, however, many herbal and otherbotanical products are readily available to US con-sumers under the Dietary Supplement Health andEducation Act of 1994, which regulates them only asfood supplements and requires no previous studies of safety and efficacy. A few herbal products have been removed from the market by the Food andDrug Administration because of adverse events. Arecent example is agents that contain ephedra because its sympathomimetic activity has been associated withcardiovascular complications, including death. Herbs may attenuate or lessen the effect of a drug either by direct action on its target or by altering itspharmacokinetics. 17,97 Herbs such as feverfew, gar- lic, ginger, and ginkgo have anticoagulant effects and should be avoided by patients using warfarin, hepa-rin, aspirin, and related agents. Red clover, Dongquai, and licorice, because of their phytoestrogencomponents, should not be used by patients usingtamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. St. John wort was a popular product for depression, at least equivalent in efficacy to tricyclics and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors in mild to moderate depression andwith a side effect profile superior to both. 98,99It was found, however, that St. John wort induces cyto- chrome P450 CYP3A4. Reduced plasma levels ofSN38, an active of irinotecan, have beenreported after simultaneous use. 100Such metabolic interactions preclude St. John wort for patients onmedications metabolized by CYP3A4. 101 Although not an herb, grapefruit juice was found www.chestjournal.org CHEST / 13 2/3/ SEPTEMBER, 2007 SUPPLEMENT 349S Copyright \u00a9 2007 American College of Chest Physicians on March 12, 2009 www.chestjournal.org Downloaded from to significantly change the plasma level of many prescription drugs. Further study found that furano-coumarin derivatives inhibit intestinal CYP3A4,which consequently increases the bioavailability ofdrugs that are substrate to metabolism bythis enzyme. 102,103 Interestingly, such interaction ini- tially was discovered by accident in an ethanol-calcium channel blocker interaction study in whichgrapefruit juice was used as the vehicle for thealcohol. 104Details of herbs-drug interactions can be found at several sources.85,105 Recommendation 15. It is recommended that patients be ad- vised to avoid therapies promoted as \"alterna-tives\" to mainstream care. Grade of recommen- dation, 1A Rationale and Evidence: Alternative therapies that claim to improve survival have largely been demon- strated to be ineffective in clinical trials. 106Random- ized trials have shown no benefit or, in some cases, shorter survival for high-dose vitamin C,107,108 shark cartilage,109hydrazine sulfate,110-113 and mistletoe extracts.114-117 Cohort or phase II studies therapy have been shown to haveshorter survival, after adjustment for known prog-nostic factors, than those avoiding such therapies. Research Priorities We view the following as high-priority areas of research: effectiveness of complementary therapies in the management of symptoms or disease pro-cesses for which our current treatment options arenot satisfactory; mechanisms of action as explained bycontemporary biomedical science; definitive databaseof drug-supplement interactions; and new derived from botanicals or other supplements ortheir synergistic effect with conventional medicine. Conclusion The use of CAM is common among cancer patients. These therapies are very diverse in their origin, theory,practice, safety, and efficacy. Some of the therapieshave been shown in studies to be helpful in reducingsymptoms experienced by cancer patients. These com-plementary therapies (used as adjuncts to mainstreamcancer treatment) are increasingly integrated into reg-ular oncologic care, leading to integrative oncology.Dietary supplements, herbs, and other botanicals canbe problematic because of their adverse effects orinteractions with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or sur-gery. There are those therapies promoted as \"alterna-tive\" to mainstream cancer treatment. Patients who usethese \"alternative\" therapies are at risk for missing thewindow of opportunity for effective treatment. It isimportant for all involved in the care of cancer patientsto help patients distinguish between the two, and toapproach complementary and alternative therapies ap-propriately to receive benefit while avoiding harm.Specific advice should be provided after consideringthe level of evidence and the risk-to-benefit ratio.Health-care professionals should know where to findreliable sources of information. Summary of Recommendations 1. It is recommended that all patients with lung cancer be specifically asked about theuse of CAM. Grade of recommendation, 1C 2.
