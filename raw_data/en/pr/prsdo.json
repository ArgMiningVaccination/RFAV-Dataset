[Click here to view Issues/Resolutions](https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/files/2023/08/HIR-Upgraded-to-HL7-2.5.1-v1.5-Issues-Resolutions.pdf). As a Healthcare provider participating in the Hawaii Immunization Registry (HIR), you have two methods to submit data to the HIR: - Data Exchange via the HIR User Interface (UI). This method is where a user logs into the HIR and uploads a HL7 patient immunization record file. If you are a provider using this method, the UI is up and running and you can begin uploading your backlog and current patient immunization records now. - Web services using an EMR/EHR or SOAP UI application to submit real-time patient immunization records outside of utilizing the HIR UI. If you are utilizing web services to submit patient immunization records, it will be necessary to schedule onboarding meetings with our HIR vendor to provide you with web services login credentials. Reminder As of November 15, 2022, all participating providers must now complete and submit their annual HIR enrollment online. For instructions on how to submit your Online Facility Agreement, please refer to [this document](/docd/files/2022/11/Online-Facility-Agreement-Instructions.pdf) If you have any questions or need to report interoperability issues, please contact the [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#235146444a5057515a4b464f5363474c4b0d4b4254424a4a0d444c55).

Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program To meet requirements, eligible professionals and eligible hospitals and/or critical access hospitals must be in active engagement with an immunization registry or other type of Public Health agency to submit electronic public health data in a meaningful way using Certified Electronic Health Record Technology. Active engagement can be in the form of registration of intent, testing and validation, and ongoing electronic submission of data to the registry.
