PURPOSE: LHH's goal is to provide care in the least restrictive setting. The use of the resident locator system is intended to ensure safety and maximize resident's freedom. BACKGROUND: LHH has installed in its new building a Wi-Fi based tracking system (brand named AeroScout\u00ae). A tag worn by a resident regul arly signals its presence. Standard Wi-Fi access points detect the signal, which system software uses to determine the tag's location and to associate it with the resi dent's name, MR#, and primary language. Special detectors, called exciters, are installed in critical locations (including exits from the LHH neighborhoods, fire doors, main hos pital exits, entrance to swimming pool). These cause a nearby tag to signal its pres ence. For any resident wearing a tag, the authorized area for wandering is determined and pre-programmed. If the resident attempts to go into an unauthorized location (e .g., an elopement risk resident exits a fire door), the system transmits alerts to predet ermined recipients via their wireless devices, so that staff can intervene. PROCEDURE: 1. Resident Assessment: a. At every assessment ( admission, re-admission, quar terly, annual, significant change of condition, or other as needed), t he RCT will assess each resident for wandering/elopement risk. b. If the RCT determines the resident is cognitively impaired and has a prior history of, or a new episode of, wandering, elo pement, or inability to return to the neighborhood without help, the RCT wi ll discuss the risks and benefits of monitoring the resident with the locator system. c. If deciding to use the locator system , the RCT will identify the resident's risk category as one of the following: File: 24-18 Resident Locator System Revised July 9, 2019 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 6 i. Not safe to leave the neighborhood unescorted (resident category is \"Unauthorized\"). ii. Safe to walk unescorted through LHH's new building (resident category is \"Indoor Only\"). d. The RCT will discuss t he plan and describe the natur e and purpose of tracking with the resident and/or su rrogate decision maker. The physician then obtains informed consent from the resident and/ or the surrogate decision maker. The physician will write in the resident's chart an order in EHR for both the application of the locator tag and the cat egory of AeroScout authorization (i.e., \"Unauthorized\" or \"Indoor Only\"). 2. of the R esident Locator Tag: a. The resident's care plan shall include location tracking, the Charge Nurse or designee shall: i. Use the system database to assign a tag; place the tag on the resident (usually with a wristband; other options might include attaching to a wheel chair); and set the resident's tag to the appropriate risk category (i.e., \"Unauthorized\" or \"Indoor Only\"). ii. Check that the database correctly asso ciates the tag to the resident's full name, Medical Record Number (MRN) , date of birth, gender, primary language, and phot ograph. iii. Test that the locator ta g appears on the monitoring map. 3. Resident Locator System and Communication of Alerts: a. Location Monitoring: From a nursing st ation computer, the neighborhood staff can locate the resident's tag on maps of the neighborhoods and the new LHH buildingsinside the hospital building . When a Stage 1 Alert is triggered, an audible al ert (i.e., \"Stop, go back\") is heard through the speakers above the first set of exit doors on the neighborhood. b. When a Stage 2, 3, or 4 alert is triggered, designate d AeroScout\u00ae computers at the nursing station will di splay a pop-up message with the resident's name, photograph, and current location on a facili ty map. Neighborhood staff will also receive alerts on their wireless devices containing the re sident's name and location. File: 24-18 Resident Locator System Revised July 9, 2019 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 6 c. North and South Resi dence Neighborhood Alerts: i. A Stage 1 Alert (Redirection) is tr iggered if an \"Unauthorized\" resident approaches the exciters above the neigh borhood's first main exit door. The audible alert is a pre-recorded message that states, \"Stop, go back.\". (Messages are available in several languages). ii. A Stage 2 Alert is triggered if an \"U nauthorized\" resident does not respond to the Stage 1 Alert and c ontinues to the door adjacen t to the elevators. The resident's name and location is sent to neighborhood staffsstaff's wireless devices iii. Pavilion Mezzanine and Pavilion Acute Neighborhood Alerts: Due to architectural reasons, the Pavilion Mezzanine and Pavilion Acute neighborhoods will only use Stage 3 and Stage 4 elopement alerts. Staff on these neighborhoods will be trained to monitor the elevator area for elopement risk residents that atte mpt to leave the neighborhood. iv. A Stage 3 Alert is triggered for the following: If an \"Unauthorized\" or \"Indoor Only\" resident exits via a delayed egress fire door. The resident's name and loca tion is sent to the neighborhood staffs wireless devices. If an \"Unauthorized\" resident approac hes or enters an elevator. The resident's name and location is sent to neighborhood staffs wireless devices and the resident's tag stat us is automatically updated to \"Wandering\". v. A Stage 4 Alert is triggered if a re sident with an \"Unauthorized\" or \"Indoor Only\" tag exits the Pavilion main doors, a loading dock door, a ground floor exterior fire exit door, or enters the pool area. The resident's name and last known location is s ent to the neighborhood staffsstaff's wireless devices and to security . A pop-up notification will al so appear on the neighborhood's designated AeroScout\u00ae computers as well as the Sheriff's designated Aeroscout computer. The resident's t ag status is autom atically updated to \"Wandering Outdoors\". Staff should verify the resident's last point of exit within the hospital to determine the resident's last known locati on as the icon on the hospital map will be seen bouncing around while it is attempting to find the tag it's associated with . File: 24-18 Resident Locator System Revised July 9, 2019 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 4 of 6 4. Authorized Exits: a. For All Neighborhoods: i. Appointments and Activities within LHH: The neighborhood staff can temporarily change a resident's tag stat us from \"Unauthorized\" to \"Indoor Authorization\" via MobileView softwar e. The resident can then be escorted off the neighborhood without triggering an alert. ii. Appointments and Activities outside of LHH: If a resident needs to be escorted off campus (e.g. SFGH appo intment) without triggering an alert, neighborhood staff can change a residen t's tag status via MobileView software to \"Full Authorization\". For Pavilion Residence Neighborhoods, the neighborhood staff mu st manually reset the resident's tag to the original status using MobileView. iii. For the North and South resident neighborhoods, the resident's AeroScout tag will automatically reset to the resi dent's original status upon re-entry to the unit. Once the resident has returned to the unit, staff is responsible for verifying that the resident is present and that the resident's tag status has been updated correctly. For Pavilion Residence Neighborhoods, the neighborhood staff must manually reset the resident's tag to the original status using MobileView. 5. Responding to Resident Locator System Alerts: a. Neighborhood staff is responsible for re sponding to resident locator system alerts by locating and redirecting the resident safely back to the neighborhood. b. If the resident cannot be located, staff will init iate post-elopement response procedures. (See Elopement Response Procedure.) 6. Checking Resident Lo cator Tag and Function: a. The neighborhood Charge Nurse or design ee is responsible for maintaining the database of neighborhood residents w ho wear locator tags, and for communicating to neighborhood staff wh ich residents wear the tags. b. The neighborhood Charge Nurse or designe e is responsible for the following: i. Upon admission, readmission, or re location of a resident assigned an AeroScout\u00ae tag, the Char ge nurse/designee will a ssign and/or check that the resident has the appropriate categor y of authorization on the MobileView as per physician order. File: 24-18 Resident Locator System Revised July 9, 2019 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 5 of 6 ii. The Charge Nurse or designee will verify that when a resident with an assigned a tag returns to his/her neighbor hood (e.g. from OOP, outside appointments, ER visits, LHH clinic or rehab appointments) , the resident is still wearing the assigned tag. The Char ge Nurse/ designee w ill also confirm through MobileView that the resident's name, MRN number, category, and status are accurate and have revert ed back to the original form. iii. Every shift, the Charge Nurse/designee will: Ensure that each nursing assistant ve rifies the placement of a resident's AeroScout tag and documents this info rmation in the electronic health record (EHR). Print an AeroScout assets list report and check that each resident with an assigned a tag has an associated tag ID, has the correct MRN associated with the resident, has the correct Ca tegory and Status, resident is detected in the neighborhood, or the resident's location is otherwise known (e.g., out on pass), and the last update time is current. iv. Upon discharge of a resident with an AeroScout tag to home or community, the Charge Nurse or designee will remo ve the AeroScout tag from the resident. c. The neighborhood Charge Nurse or designe e is responsible for checking at each shift the tag's battery status using the AeroScout\u00ae battery level report. i. If battery level is below 20%\"LOW \", the Charge Nurse or designee immediately issues a new tag to the resident and places the low-battery tag in a bin to return fo r battery replacement. ii. If the battery level is \"MEDIUM\", the neighborhood C harge Nurse or designee may replace the tag or c ontinue to watch for a few days. d. The assigned care-giver checks the resi dent's tag and strap for wear and tear at each shift. 7. Staff Education: a. Neighborhood staff shall be trained upon orientation or if transferred within LHH on the use of the resident locator system and response to its alerts. b. Additional education shal l be provided to staff if a significant system enhancement is implemented or whenever indicated. File: 24-18 Resident Locator System Revised July 9, 2019 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 6 of 6 c. Neighborhood staff will be trained that residents with elopement/wander risk must be escorted by staff at all timesalways escorted by staff while in the garden areas (detectors do not currently cover the garden areas). d. All staff are to be educated to be caut ious when entering or exiting controlled areas to prevent accident al resident elopement. 8. Performance Improvement: a. The Licensed Nurse shall complete an Unusual Occurrence report if a resident elopes from the neighborhood. b. Resident elopement incidents will be perio dically reviewed to identify process improvement opportunities and staff training needs. 9. Other Uses: a. If the Resident Care Team (RCT) identif ies possible uses for the locator system that would enhance the resident's safety and quality of life, these possibilities may be discussed with the resident and/or surrogate decision-maker for approval. The use of the resident locator system shall be described in the resident's care plan. ATTACHMENT: None.

Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabi litation Center shall im plement procedures to safely manage the care of residents ident ified to be at risk for aspiration. 2. The facility recognizes the resident's or designated surrogate decision maker's right to make an informed decision where the resi dent's enhanced quality of life, provided by eating and drinking, may be of greater importance t han reducing the risk of aspiration. PURPOSE: To promote resident safety and enhance resident quality of life with re spect to diet and feeding interventions. DEFINITIONS: 1. Line of Sight - resident is wit hin view of staff while eating. 2. Close Supervision - one staff sitting with no more than 4 residents during mealtime. Staff shall ensure that recommended aspi ration precautions (e.g., standard precautions or individualized precauti ons recommended by speech therapy and ordered by the physician) are followed by actively cueing, assisting, and/or observing the resident during meal timemealtime . 3. 1:1 - resident needs direct assistance or supervision dur ing oral intake (e.g., impulsive eating behaviors, cues needed, unable to feed self, level of risk for aspiration). PROCEDURE: 1. Identification of At-Risk Residents a. Residents shall be evaluat ed by the Resident Care Te am (RCT) and identified as being at risk for aspiration if they ha ve clinical signs of swallowing difficulty/aspiration, dem onstrate unsafe eating behaviors or have other conditions that place them at risk (e.g., reduced alertness, need to be fed in a reclined position, partially or completely edentulou s with no dentures). At a minimum, the RCT includes a physician and a nurse. b. If the resident is partially or co mpletely edentulous with no dentures: i. The RCT shall assess if the prescribed diet is deemed safe; File: 26-02 Management of Dysphagia and Aspiration Risk Revised July 12, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 7 ii. The physician shall order a dysphagia evaluation if the residents' ability to safely swallow the prescribed diet is in question. iii. The registered dietitian shall assess the residents' ability to tolerate the prescribed diet iv. The physician shall document discussion regarding aspiration risk if the resident is prescribed a diet other than pureed and; v. The physician shall refer the resident to the dental clinic unless there is documented reason by the physician t hat the referral is not necessary. c. Once a resident has been identified as bei ng at risk for aspiration, Nursing shall place a pink dot at the head of the resi dent's bed and give the resident a pink sticker on their wristband. Staff and volunt eers shall be trained on this color coding system and what it means. d. Residents who are assess ed to be at risk for aspiration, excluding those who are unable to eat by mouth (also known as NPO), shall be identified and have a physician's order for standard aspiration prec autions, which include the following: i. Line of sight supervision when eati ng, unless documented otherwise in the Medical Record. ii. Resident shall be posit ioned as upright as possible when eating/drinking, and the resident's head prevented from tilting back, as possible. iii. Resident shall be fed/cued to eat slowly, taking small bites. iv. When feeding a resident, make sure that the resident swallo ws each bite before continuing feeding. v. Resident shall remain upright for 20 minutes after a meal. 2. Indications for Referral to Speech Pathology for a Dysphagia Evaluation a. Residents who fall into one or more of the fo llowing categories shall be referred, by physician's order, to the Speech Pa thology Department for a dysphagia evaluation: i. Those admitted with a know n swallowing disorder, or hi story that is suspicious for dysphagia (unless NPO and not a candidate for oral feeding). ii. As described under Procedure 1 b (ii). File: 26-02 Management of Dysphagia and Aspiration Risk Revised July 12, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 7 iii. Those who have clinical signs of dys phagia or aspiration and are candidates for ongoing oral feeding. Indications for re ferral to Speech Pathology include, but are not limited to, the following: c oughing, choking, holding food in mouth, significant pocketing of food, significantly delayed swallow, significant leakage of food or liquid from m outh, food or liquid coming from tracheostomy, and/or recurrent pneumonias. If in doubt about whet her or not a referral is indicated, contact the Speech Pathology Department. iv. Alert residents who are being considered for enteral feeding, unless clinically inappropriate (Refer to LHHPP 26-03, Enteral Tube Nutrition), and those on enteral feeding whose clinical condition has improved sufficiently that they may be candidates for oral feeding. v. Residents with a known swallowing diso rder or clinical signs of dysphagia and/or aspiration who are being considered fo r a diet upgrade. (If a decision to upgrade a resident's diet has already been made for quality of life reasons, referral is not necessary, but may be i ndicated in order for a Speech-Language Pathologist to provide training regarding reducing the risk of aspiration on the upgraded diet. All necessary documentati on regarding a resident's or surrogate decision maker's understanding of risks vs. benefits of upgrading diet and agreement to accept risks must be in pl ace prior to the Speech Pathologist's intervention). b. Referral to the Speech Pathology Departm ent may also be indicated in cases of unexplained weight loss, dehydr ation, and/or poor oral intake, in order to rule out dysphagia as a contributing factor. c. Dysphagia evaluation is by physician order only. If the evaluation is considered clinically urgent, the physician shall ma rk the order \"urgent\" and call the Speech Pathology Department. d. RCT members shall alert the physician when signs of dysphagia, aspiration, or change in swallowing function are observed. 3. Dysphagia Evaluation a. Dysphagia evaluations shall be carried out by a Rehabilitation Center Policy and Procedure #90-05, Establishment of Tr eatment Programs and Documentation: Dysphagia. b. Evaluation of Residents for U pgraded Food/Liquid Consistencies When a dysphagia evaluation involves upgr aded food or liquid consistencies not currently included in the resident's diet or der, the following Tray Precautions shall be taken: File: 26-02 Management of Dysphagia and Aspiration Risk Revised July 12, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 4 of 7 i.

Treatment a. Following a dysphagia ev aluation, the Speech Pat hologist shall proceed with swallowing therapy, when indicated. b. If treatment involves upgr aded food/liquid consistencies not currently included in the resident's diet order, follow Tray Precautions delineated in paragraph 3b i-iv, above. 5. Referral to Occupational Therapy a. Occupational Therapy consultation s hall be considered if positioning of the resident during feeding is difficult or body posture increases aspiration risk. b. Occupational Therapy consultation r equires a physician order and a referral form. 6. Management of Residents W ho Are at Risk for Aspiration a. Staff who are feeding or supervising residents designated to be at risk for aspiration are responsible for knowing and complying with the resident's diet order, standard aspiration precautions, and any indi vidualized precautions assigned to the resident. b. Certified and Licensed nursing staff s hall be provided with mealtime competency training by Nursing Education or des ignated trainers upon hire and annually. Facility personnel shall be trained on c hoking prevention and intervention upon hire and annually. c. A sign directing visitors to check with the neighborhood nursing staff before serving food or drinks to a resident is located in the Pavilion Lobby and designated areas. d. Nursing is responsible for ensuring that family members and regular visitors who assist residents with their meals have been tr ained. If a family or volunteer needs File: 26-02 Management of Dysphagia and Aspiration Risk Revised July 12, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 5 of 7 additional training regarding feeding te chniques, nursing may recommend referral to Speech Pathology. Staff shall documen t family or volunteer training in the medical record and resident care plan, including the dat e of training. e. Residents with a pink sticker on thei r wristbands shall not be given or sold food/liquid by anyone who is not awar e of the resident's feeding needs. f. Diet texture modifications (including th ickened liquid) or enteral feeding, may be ordered to reduce the risk of aspiration. These interventions may be suggested by the Speech Pathologist followin g a swallowing evaluation but shall be implemented only after careful resident assessment by the RCT and orders changed by the physician. Diet texture modification for purposes of reducing aspiration risk is a form of treatment and, as with enteral feeding, is subject to quality of life considerations/Advance Care Planning (Refer to LHHPP 24-05, Advance Care Planning, and LHHPP 26-03, Enteral Tube Nutrition). g. For residents whose nutrition is via enter al tube, Nurses shall follow interventions to reduce aspiration risk as per Nursing policies and procedures (Refer to NPP E5.0 Enteral Tube Feeding Management). Individualized Aspiration Precautions a. Individualized (vs. sta ndard) aspiration precautions may be developed by the Speech Pathologist following a swallo wing evaluation; Examples include: i. Close supervision when eating and drinking ii. Provide cues/assist for unsafe eating behaviors iii. Thin down thick food iv. Small sips of liquid v. Alternate liquids and solids vi. Do not use straw vii. Cut food into small pieces viii. Cue resident to tuck chin ix. Cue or remind resident to swallow twice x. Cue to swallow food/liquid before taking the next bite/sip File: 26-02 Management of Dysphagia and Aspiration Risk Revised July 12, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 6 of 7 b. The Speech Pathologist shall review recommended individual precautions with Nursing staff and provide training, as needed. c.

Nursing shall include this information when communicating the diet order to Nutrition Services. e. e.f. Nutrition Services shall print the list of individualized precautions recommended by speech therapy on the meal ticket, prov iding an easy reference for caretakers. f.g. Residents with individua lized precautions, whose swallow function appears to have improved or declined, shall be referred to Speech Pathology for re-evaluation and updating of precauti ons, as needed. When a reevaluationreevaluation is not indicated and Speech Pathology is no longer treating or routinely re-checking the resident, the Speech Pathologist may be in vited to attend RCT meetings for that resident with individualized aspiration precautions. 8. Follow-Up a. The Speech Pathology Department is av ailable to monitor any resident during a meal who has been seen for a dysphagia ev aluation, is on t he diet recommended by Speech Pathology, and has not had any change in condition. The request may be made by any member of the RCT. No physician's order is required. The Department shall be contacted directly by phone. A physician's order for a re- evaluation is required for patients whose diet was either upgr aded or downgraded without the involvement of the Speech Pathology De partment, when there has been a change in condition, or when re-e valuation for diet upgrade is being requested. b. When an order with aspiration precautions is discontinued without the involvement of the Speech Pathology Department, the reason(s) shall be documented in the medical record by the physi cian and licensed nurse. The Diet office shall also be notified in order to delete the in formation from the tray ticket. 9. Documentation on Informed Decision a.

Enteral tube nutrition (ETN) is a form of medical therapy that is to be instituted only after careful resident assessment and if clinically indicated as necessary by the Resident Care Team (RCT). It require s monitoring to assure adequacy and appropriateness. 2. Laguna Honda Hospital and Reh abilitation Center (LHH) s hall provide treatment and services to residents receiving ETN, to prevent potential complications with enteral feeding and when possible, to restore oral feeding skills. PURPOSE: To promote and maintain optimal care of re sidents with decreased oral intake and for whom ETN is deemed appropriate. ETN may be appropriate when medical problems, including nutritional, clinical, functional, psychosocial and comfort status, result in decreased oral intake. However, decreased oral intake is a common feature of many terminal illnesses. ETN may not be indica ted in cases where the burdens of the intervention outweigh the benefits to the resident. DEFINITION: \"Enteral feeding\" : (tube feeding) is the delivery of nutrients through a feeding tube directly into the stomac h, duodenum, or jejunum. \"Feeding tube\" : a medical device used to provi de liquid nourishment, fluids and medications by bypassing oral intake. There are two basic categories: naso-gastric and gastrostomy. The type of feeding tube used must be based on clinical assessment and needs of the resident. PROCEDURE: 1. Assessment and Decision Making Process a. Initial evaluation: When the RCT has co mpleted an evaluation, which may lead to placement of an enteral tube, a formal dysphagia evaluation is recommended for all alert residents unless clin ically inappropriate or perf ormed prior to admission. The evaluation shall be repeated when the resident's clinical condition improves. i. Should a resident have had a feeding tube prior to admission/ in another care setting, the RCT shall review the basis fo r the initial placem ent of the tube and the resident's current condition to determine if tube feeding remains necessary. File: 26-03 Enteral Tube Nutrition Revised September 14, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 6 b. Initiation: ETN shall be initiated only on written orders of t he primary attending physician or designee, and only after info rmed consent has been obtained from the resident or surrogate decision maker (SDM). i. Family consult: The attending physici an shall evaluate the prognosis for the individual resident and consi der the expressed desires of either the resident or the resident's surrogate decis ion maker prior to beginnin g enteral tube nutrition. The decision to insert an enteral tube s hall be made after consultation with the resident and/or family and t he RCT members, and only after carefully reviewing risks, benefits, and other alternatives . Any advance directives should be carefully reviewed. If it is decided not to begin ETN in a resident for whom other feeding alternatives are not possible, co mfort care and palliative interventions shall be considered and provided as appropriate. ii. Informed consent: Informed consent for enteral tube insertion shall be obtained from the resident or su rrogate decision-maker in accordance with hospital policy (Refer to MSPP C02-01 Pa tient's Consent for Treatment and Operation). If the resi dent has no surrogate decision maker, the physician must promptly notify the resident, orally and in writing, of such determination. In instances where the resident is comato se or in a minimally conscious state, notification is not clinic ally appropriate, but the physician must document his/her determination and shall notify t he resident promptly if the resident's condition changes (LHHPP 29-08 Unrepresented Residents Lacking Decisional Capacity and Epple Procedure Implementation). c. Time-limited trials: When the potent ial benefits and burdens of enteral tube insertion are unclear, a time-limited tr ial may be ordered. After a predetermined time, caregivers and the resident and/or fa mily should reassess the response to the therapy, including nutritional param eters, resident well- being, comfort and quality of life. An informed decision may then be made as to whether to continue with the therapy. i. There are possible side-effects and di scomfort associated with the use of nasogastric tubes. There will be clinic ally pertinent documentation for extended use of nasogastric tube (e.g., greater than 4-6 weeks). d. Withdrawal: The resident or surr ogate decision-maker (SDM) may request withdrawal of an enteral feeding tube at any time. When withdrawal is not requested by the resident or SDM, or when a resident lacks medical decision making capacity and has no surrogate, consi deration of withdrawal of ETN shall follow Care Planni ng and Care and 26-03 Tube Nutrition Revised September 14, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 6 a. Refer to Nursing Policy and Procedure E5.0 Enteral Tube Feeding Management for the care and management of t he resident with a feeding tube. b. LHH shall strive to prevent possible social isolation or negative psychosocial impacts for residents being fed by a feeding tube. c. Facilities shall maintain enteral f eeding pumps consistent with manufacturer's instructions to ensure proper mec hanical functioning and calibration. 3. Replacement of a Dislodged Feeding Tube a. A dislodged nasogastric tube shall be r eplaced by the licensed nurse, unless the physician orders state otherwise. Verification of t ube placement by X-ray shall be obtained each time that a nasogastric tube is placed or replaced. b. A dislodged gastrostomy or jejunostomy t ube that is less than 6 weeks old shall be re-inserted by Interventional Radiology or the gastroenterologist. No attempts shall be made to replace these newly placed tubes by Laguna Honda staff. c. A dislodged gastrostomy tube that is 6 weeks or mo re may be replaced by the registered nurse who has dem onstrated knowledge and skill, unless the physician orders state otherwise. A gas trografin study shall be or dered by the physician to confirm tube placement. The physician shall verify results of the radiology study before resuming orders for ETN. If there is question about plac ement of the gastrostomy tu be, or if t he registered nurse is unable to replace the gastrosto my tube, the physician shall order the transfer of the resident to Interventional Radiology or the Emergency Room for gastrostomy tube re-insertion. There s hall be direct communication between the Laguna Honda physician and the radiologist or the Emergency Room physician confirming correct placement of the tube before resuming orders for ETN. d. A dislodged jejunostomy tube shall be r eplaced by Interventional Radiology or the gastroenterologist. The register ed nurse can place a foley or gastrostomy tube to keep the tract open until the resident is abl e to be scheduled for the procedure. 4. Monitoring a. Monitoring of side-effects: Residents should be monitored for problems with ETN. These may include chronic nasopharyngeal i rritation, repeated tube removals and resistance to reinsertion, immobilization due to application of restraints, diarrhea, recurrent reflux and aspiration of gastric c ontents. If the side effe cts of the therapy are substantial, the physician should reev aluate the appropriateness of the enteral tube in consultation with the resident or the surrogate decision-maker and the RCT. File: 26-03 Enteral Tube Nutrition Revised September 14, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 4 of 6 b. Monthly review: In reviewing monthl y orders on residents receiving ETN, the attending physician should review the effica cy of the therapy. This should include a review of the resident's general medica l and functional status as well as the resident's weight and nutritional intake. Re sident well-being, comfort, dignity and quality of life should be evaluated on an on going basis. In addition, the attending physician should review the side effects and response to therapy as outlined above. c. Periodic reevaluation: As part of the quarterly resident care conferences (RCC), the attending physician in concert with the other RCT members and the resident/family should reevaluate the goa ls of the enteral tube nutrition. The previous assessments should be consid ered as well as any change in the resident's condition or prognosis. Options of ongoing enteral tube nutrition, surgical tube placement or palliative care wit hout enteral tube nutrition should be considered. It may be appropriate to consult the Ethics Committee at this time if it is decided to discontinue this therapy. d. Nutrition reevaluation: The dietitian makes interval assessments of residents on enteral tube nutrition and provides suggesti ons for changes in nutritional therapy if necessary. During the quarterly RCC, t he RCT shall review the nutritional plan and the dietitian's documentation in t he EHR for residents receiving ETN. e. Interaction with medications: Certain medications (e.g., phenytoin) may be affected by enteral nutrition, and others (e .g., extended-release tablet and capsule formulations) should not be crushed or otherwise altered for enteral tube administration. For specific recomm endations on medications known to be affected by enteral nutrition, and those with formulations that should not be altered, refer to the Nursing Policy and Procedures or consult the Clinical Pharmacist. 5. Documentation a. Clinical documentation shall at a minimum include the following elements: i. Physician - completed physician order t hat shall include indication(s) for tube feeding, diagnosis and f unctional impairment(s). Should the use of a nasogastric tube be extended, the physician shall document clinically pertinent information and rationale. ii. Registered Dietitian - assessment of caloric needs, nutritional requirements that includes feeding flow rate and type of formula. iii. Nursing - technical and nutritional aspect of feeding tubes (e.g. tube size, location, feeding flow rate, care of tube site and replacement) shall be documented in the nursing flowsheet in the EHR; interventions for File: 26-03 Enteral Tube Nutrition Revised September 14, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 5 of 6 management of ETN and to minimize the risk of complications related to feeding shall be documented in care plan in the EHR. iv. Speech Therapist - evaluation to rest ore normal eating skills to the extent possible. b. Each discipline (Physician, Register ed Dietitian and Nursing) shall evaluate resident's response to treatment and intervent ions in their progress notes at least quarterly. 6. Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement a. An Unusual Occurrence (UO) report shall be completed by the licensed nurse when a resident is identified with a t ube feeding complication. Examples of complications requiring the subm ission of a UO report include: i. Clogged tube ii. Dislodgement of tube iii. Aspiration iv. Leakage around the insertion site v. Erosion at the insertion site vi. Abdominal wall abscess vii. Stomach or intestinal perforation viii. Peritonitis ix. Tracheoesophageal fistula x. complication b. The Performance Improv ement and Patient Safety Co mmittee shall periodically review UO reports and case reviews to determine trends and patterns, and provide feedback on compliance issues with exis ting policies and procedures, and possible clinical and other interventions for perfo rmance improvement in clinical care.

Washington DC, WA: Association for Professionals in Infection 2022 B2 Hand Hygiene Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 1 of 9 HAND HYGIENE POLICY: 1. It is the policy of this facility to adhere to the infection prevention and control (IPC) practices for hand hygiene as established by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) to prevent the transmission of disease-causing illnesses to others. Gloves are not intended to be a replacement for proper hand hygiene. Hand hy giene will be performed at a minimum: 2. Gloves are not a replac ement for proper hand hygiene. Prior to beginning work shift Before eating After using the bathroom After sneezing/coughing/tissue use Before donning/doffing personal protection equipment (PPE) o PPE includes: gloves, gown, mask, face/eye shield Before and after providing direct resident contact Before performing an aseptic task (e.g., placing an indwelling device) or handling invasive medical devices Before moving from work on a soiled body site to a clean body site on the same patient After contact with blood, body fluids, or contaminated surfaces After touching a patient or t he patient's immediate environment When hands are visibly soiled PURPOSE: The purpose of this policy is to provide in formation regarding hand hygiene practices and to guide staff in the use of proper hand hy giene standards at LHH. Proper hand hygiene has been identified as the single mo st important factor in reducing the transfer of infectious disease to others. Cross cont amination and transfer of infect ious organisms to from one person to another causing disease is well documented. Proper hand hygiene also includes proper drying of hands to avoi d wet /damp hands during care which has been shown to increase the transfer of disease-causing microbes greater than a thousand times more than dry hands (MMWR, 2003). PROCEDURE: Hand Hygiene is the term used for thoroughly cleani ng your hands by usi ng either the soap and water technique for handwashing, using an antiseptic hand wash or antiseptic hand rub or gel (i.e. alcohol-based hand sanitizer [ABH R] including foam or gel), or by using the techniques for surgical hand antisepsis (CDC, 2021) 1. In the clinical setting , hand sanitizers , must contain between 60%-95% isopropanol or ethanol alcohol only to be effective at reducing infectious File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised September 1330 , 2022 B2 Hand Hygiene Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 9 organisms. 2. Centers for Disease Control and Pr evention (CDC) recommend ABHR as a primary means of hand hygiene because it is faster, usually contains emollients to prevent dried, cracked (non-intact) skin, and is likely to be used more frequently than soap and water. Soap and water must be used instead of ABHR for hand hygiene when: 3. Soap and water must be used instead of ABHR for hand hygiene when: a. Caring for residents with C. diff , norovirus, potentially infect ious diarrheal diseases, or other spore-forming organisms that do not respond to ABHR. b. When hands are visibly soiled. 4. Hand hygiene will be performed: a. Prior to beginning work shift b. Before and after providing direct resident contact c. Before eating d. After using the bathroom e. After sneezing/coughing/tissue use f. Before donning and after doffing personal protection equipment (PPE) g. When hands are visibly soiled 5. Hand hygiene procedures: a. Hand sanitizers /ABHR: Why it works: the Mechanism of Action: The alcohol in hand sanitizers act to de nature or destroy the proteins of the microorganism serving to inactivate their ability to cause disease Procedure: i. Apply adequate product to the hands and rub hands and fingers together ii. . Cover all surfaces on both hands, front and back, and between digits iii. . Allow to air dry before donning gloves or providing care for others File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised September 1330 , 2022 B2 Hand Hygiene Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 9 b. Handwashing with soap and water : Why it works: soaps Mechanism of Action: Soaps are detergent based and when combined wit h water form a soapy lather of bubbles. A good soapy lather forms pockets called micelles that trap and remove germs, harmful chemicals, and dirt from your hands. Procedure: i. Roll up sleeves to expose skin above wrists ii. Turn on faucet and wet hands with running water iii. Use an adequate amount of liquid dispens ed soap and thoroughly distribute over hands creating sudsing effect iv.i. Vigorously rub hands together for at least 20 seconds, generating friction on all surfaces of the hands and fingers including the sides of the hands and fingers, between fingers, under fingernails, and around cuticles. Microbes are more prevalent on the tips of fingers and under the nails. v. Thoroughly rinse hands under running water wit hout touching sink or faucet, holding hands downward to allow water to run off fingertips vi. Adequately use paper towels to dry all su rfaces of the hands and wrists including between each finger space as moistu re harbors bacteria and can cause skin breakdown to allow entrance of or ganisms. Wet hands transfer more microorganisms than do dry hands. Take enough time to dry hands thoroughly. vii. Using a paper towel, turn off faucet without touching surfaces of the sink or handles of faucet which are contaminated with dise ase causing organisms. viii. Discard the paper towel into a waste container ix.ii. Use a clean paper towel to open door, if appropriate, and discard 6.2.Important Points for LHH; Liquid soaps are recommended over bar soap as bar soaps can collect disease causing microbes over time. Plain soap is effective for hand hygiene and antimicrobial soaps are not necessary as the goal is to capture the microorganisms in the s oap, not destroy them. Liqui d soap dispensers must be replaced when empty. Liquid soap should not be added (or \"topped off\") to partially filled containers due to the potential for contamination and supp ort of microbial growth. 7.3.Responsibility for monitori ng staff hand hygiene compliance lies withis a joint effort between the department headInfection Contro l, the Department Head or supervisor File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised September 1330 , 2022 B2 Hand Hygiene Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 4 of 9 of each specific neighborhood or department. Staff are responsible for comply ing with hand hygiene guidelines and for encouraging resident to wash their hand after going to the bathroom, before meal, after sneezing and coughing and as needed.. Staff should report irritati on, dermatitis or other skin weakening issues that may impact hand hygiene to their direct supervisor and infection control nurse for follo w up and other options. 8.4.Hand lotion may be used to alleviate skin dry ness associated with hand hygiene. Lotions are staff's personal items and should not be kept out ofstored in patient care areas. 9.5.Fingernails should be short enough to allow thor ough cleaning and not cause glove tears. Artificial nails harbor bacteria, cr eate wounds in fragile skin and do not conform to the LHH infe ction control protocol. ATTACHMENT: None.

Infection Control B9 Infection Control Post-Mortem Care Guidelines Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 1 of 2 INFECTION CONTROL POST-M ORTEM CARE GUIDELINES POLICY: Laguna Honda Hospital (LHH) will adhere to post-mortem care guidelines in accordance with Standard Precautions and transmission-based precaut ions as appropriate to minimize the transmission of infectious pathogens. Any specific specimens required during pos t-mortem care for decedents that are diagnosed with a suspected or confirmed infectious diseas e will be obtained at the mortuary or by trained professionals. PURPOSE: Post-mortem care is provided for the purpo se of preparing the decedent's body for a dignified viewing peri od by the family/significant ot hers at the bedside immediately following death. This time may be used for mourning as part of a metal health transition, for religious, spiritual, or for cultural traditions and rituals. In addition, post-mortem care is useful for preserving t he body for the mortuary staff. Observing the proper use of personal protecti ve equipment (PPE) is an essential element for post-mortem care by st aff even after death has occurred. Standard Precautions will be observed when caring for any resident in cluding those who are deceased. Any transmission-based precautions that are in effe ct at the time of death will continue to be observed with the appropriate PPE until the body has been transported to the morgue. A specimen collection may be required by the physician post-mortem in the event there is a confirmed or suspected outbreak on t he neighborhood, if the physician determines there is a need, or if the local health depar tment requires a specimen collection. Additionally, if there are any specimens collect ed prior to death that ar e still in the facility, these should not be discarded until the physician has been notified. PURPOSE: Laguna Honda Hospital (LHH) has adopted guideli nes for the post-mortem handling of bodies in accordance with Standard Prec autions and additional transmission-based precautions as needed to minimize the tr ansmission of infectious pathogens. LHH shall follow infection control guidelines set forth by San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), California Departmen t of Public Health (CDPH), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for collection of s pecimens during post-mortem care for decedents that are diagnosed with a sus pected or confirmed in fectious disease. PROCEDURE: 1. Post-mortem care is outlined LHHPP File: D8.0 Post-Mortem Care. File: 20209, 2022 B9 Infection Control Post-Mortem Care Guidelines Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 2 2. The attending physician of a deceased resi dent will notify the funeral director of any reportable communicable disease present at the time of death. 3. The attending physician or respirator y therapist will collect any post-mortem specimens that are required by SFDPH in a Health Order issued by the San Francisco Health Officer or other formal communication methods. 4. Nursing staff performs basic post-mortem care following the death of a resident that includes removing visible tubes, bathi ng, and other tasks to prepare the body for viewing and pick up by the morgue . using all proper Standard and appropriate Transmission-based precautions. 5. Nursing staff wears PPE for all post-mort em care following Standard Precautions. For residents suspected or confirmed with a contagious illness, st aff shall wear the appropriate transmission-based PPE for that infection at the time of death. 5. Airborne /Droplet precaut ions such as masks/respirators may not be required by HCP as there is no exhaling of infecti ous material from the decedent that may transmit the disease. 6. If applicable, Contact and blood/body flui d precautions should continue to be observed during post mortem care and noted on records for transfer to mortuary. 2022 B24 Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Infection Control Manual Page 1 of 3 RESPIRATORY HYGIENE/COUGH ETIQUETTE POLICY: 1. Staff, residents, and visitors will practice respiratory hygiene, also known as cough etiquette, when in the facility. Practicing respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette has been shown to reduce the risk of transmission of respiratory microorganisms that are spread through droplets and aerosolized spray when talking, sneezing, or coughing. PURPOSE: The purpose of this policy is to provide guida nce for when and how to practice respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette to in terrupt the spread of infect ion from the respiratory secretions. Respiratory infections spr ead primarily through coughing and sneezing, are the leading cause of illness, morbidity, and mortalit y around the globe. Respiratory pathogens are easily transmitted between people. Despite the high virulence, these illnesses are preventable with good respiratory hygiene practices including but not limited to cough etiquette when used in conjunction with hand hygi ene, social distancing, and protective masks. Most infectious agents transmitted via larg e respiratory droplets through coughs and sneezes generally travel in a 3-foot radius of an infect ed person and quickly drop to the ground. However, aerosolized spra ys, such as a sneeze, are much smaller in size and can travel up to 6 feet. These smaller particl es can be transmitted on dust particles that \"hang\" longer in the air thus permitting more opportunities to come into contact with eyes, mouth, and nose to infect others. Transmission-based precautions include havi ng the infected person wear If able, a surgical mask when medically able if they(source mask) may be used for patients who are coughing/sneezing to minimize exposure to respiratory secretions to others. PROCEDURE: 1. Signage is posted for instructions for residents, staff, and visitors to practice respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette when in the facility and to encourage staying home if not feeling well. Instructi ons include, but are not limited to: a. Covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing. b. Properly dispose of tissue in a wa ste container and perform hand hygiene. c. If no tissue is immediatel y available, the cough or sneez e particles can be directed into the upper sleeve or elbow but not directly into the hands. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2020September 30, 2022 B24 Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Infection Control Manual Page 2 of 3 d. Perform hand hygiene imm ediately either with soap an d water or alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR). e. Staff will wear a surgical mask (source control) when providing direct resident care if sneezing or coughing. f. Ill staff should refrain from working and contact their direct supervisor for guidance. g. Horizontal surfaces can become cont aminated with respiratory secretions as droplets land and have been shown to survive on these surfaces for several hours. Touching contaminated surfaces and t hen touching mucous membranes or open wounds can transmit the pathogens. Cleaning surfaces frequently with an EPA registered disinfectant can st op the transmission of infection. 2. During periods of increased respiratory infection activity in the community offer masks to persons who are coughing. Surgical masks may be used to contain respiratory secretions. Respirators, such as a N95, are not necessary for this purpose. 3. Encourage residents with respir atory symptoms to stay inside their room if possible. If non-compliant, encourage resident to sitphysically distance from others by sitting at least six feet away from others in common areas , otherwise known as social distancing. 4. ABHR stands are available at entrance to the facility and neighborhood for residents, staff, and visitors. 5. Daily cleaning and disinfecti on of horizontal surfaces in the resident's environment is required. For those who are unable or un willing to practice hand hygiene and cough etiquette for respiratory secretions, addi tional cleaning may be required. Use and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved disinfectants and cleaners. ATTACHMENT: None.

Laguna Honda Hospital (LHH) will maintain a sufficient supply of mobile isolation carts in Central Processi ng Department (CPD) for depl oyment to neighborhoods when transmission-based prec autions are implemented. 2. Pre-filled mobile isolation carts allow staff to implement specific precautions quickly and provide the proper personal protecti ve equipment (PPE) based on resident need for point-of-care access. When extended transmission-based precautions are anticipated, the isol ation cart allows for a mobile cl ean, safe unit to be placed near the point of use to sto ck an adequate supply of specific PPE. 3. PPE is readily available in multiple sizes and types on the unit for Standard Precautions and does not require an isolati on cart but is not resident specific. Isolation carts are not necessary whenfor isolation rooms wit h anterooms where adequate supply storage is available. A system will be in place toClinical staff in each unit should monitor PPE use and restocking ofrestock mobile isolation carts to ensure adequate supplies and sizes be available at the resident's door . 4. Mobile isolation carts are not placed or moved insi de the resident room butmust remain outside the room , near the door entrance . and are not to be moved inside the room for use. Cart labels and/or isolation signage will not contain any protected health information (PHI ) and will be identified with.) Carts should house the appropriate transmission-based precautions sign, not t he specific organism or disease. PURPOSE: The purpose of this policy is to provide instructions on the pr ocurement and use of isolation carts when extended use of Transmission-based precautions is required. BACKGROUND: Isolation carts provide a safe and clean port able storage base for adequate supply and point-of-care access for staff for the proper PPE for residents who have been placed on transmission-based precautions. Isolation carts provide quick access to PPE and help prevent cross contamination of supplies. Adequate PPE supplies in multiple sizes and at the point of care promotes safe use to reduce the transmission of microorganisms. DEFINITIONS: Standard Precautions : Infection prevention practices that apply to all residents, regardless of suspected or confirmed in fection status, in any setting in which healthcare is delivered. These practices include: hand hygiene; use of gloves, File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 20205, 2022 B25 Isolation Cart Use Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 3 gown, mask, eye protection, or face sh ield, depending on the ant icipated exposure; room placement; safe injection practi ces, respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette; environmental cleaning and disinfection; and safe management of textiles and laundry. Transmission: Passage of an infectious agent that is in a person's blood or body fluids to another person either directly or , more commonly indirectly via staff hands or via medical equipment that has not been cleaned and disinfected adequately between residents. Enhanced Standard Precautions : Expanded use of gloves and gowns in skilled nursing facilities based on resident risk, lik elihood of multi-drug resistant organism (MDRO) colonization, and transmission during specific care activities with greatest risk for MDRO contamination of st aff hands, clothes, and the environment. PROCEDURE: 1. When a resident or patient is suspected or diagnosed with an infect ion that requires additionalPatients placed on transmission-based precautions beyond Standard Precautions,(TBP) will prompt the charge nurse willto contact CPD and request delivery of an isolation ca rt to the neighborhood. 2. Prior to deployment, the isolation cart will be prepared by CPD technicians by disinfecting and stocking the cart with PPE: disposable gowns, aprons, gloves in various sizes, surgical masks, face shields, goggles, shoe covers, and disinfectant wipes. Specific individualized PPE such as resp irators (e.g. N95, P APR units) will not be placed on the cart but will be obtained by stock supplies on the unit to meet specific fit-testing criteria. a. Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) , norovirus, and other s pore-forming organisms require hand washing with soap and water a nd not the use of alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) or hand sanitizer for hand hygi ene due to the spore formation that is not inactivated by alcohol. In addi tion, environmental cleaning should be completed using bleach-based disinfection such as with bleach wipes or bleach- based solution. Alcohol-based products will not be stocked on the carts used for these pathogens. 3. Isolation carts are placed outside the residents' rooms a nd are to be kept clean and stocked by Nursing while in use until the TBP are discontinued . 4. Health care personnel ( HCP) and others must perform HH prior to touching items on the cart for use. 5.

Cleaning and Dis infecting Non-Critical Re sident Care Equipment California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Enhanced Standard Precautions for Skilled Nursing Facilities C16 Scabies Management Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 1 of 9 Page 1 of 9 SCABIES MANAGEMENT POLICY: 1. Residents are to be scr eened for scabies infestation by the licensed nurse upon admission, preferably before bei ng transferred into a bed. A licensed nurse or physicianIt is the poli cy of Laguna Honda Hospital & Rehabilitation (LHH) to provide preventative measures for scabies transmission, and to manage a scabies outbreak by implementing measur es to diagnosis, reduce spread and provide safe and effective treatment to those affected by scabies based on current best practices as outlined by the Centers of Disease Prevention and Control (CDC). 2. The Infection control nurse (ICN)/team will promptly assess any residentcollaborate with a suspicious skin rash and/or pruritus. 3. Whenever possible, the diagnosis of scabi es should be confirmed by identifying the mite or mite eggs or fecal matter (scy bala), however, a negative skin scraping does not preclude treatment in the presence of a suspicious rash since as few as 10-15 mites may be present. 4. The Infection Control Nurse is to be in formed of suspected or confirmed cases of scabies. 5. Contact Precautions are to be implement ed promptly for suspected or confirmed cases including appropriate use of gloves when providing direct care. 6. Scabies outbreaks shall be managed with a comprehensive, physician's and other interdisciplinary approach that includes Infection Control, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Outpatient Medical Clinic/, Em ployee Health, and Environmental Services (EVS). a. An outbreak suggests that transmissi on has been occurring for several weeks to months since the time from exposure to symptoms may be as long as 4-6 weeks (1-4 days if previous infestation has occurred). b. Two (2) or more confirmed cases or one (1) confirmed case and at least two (2) suspect cases occurring among residents, health care workers, visitors or volunteers during a 2-week period should be consi dered anteams to promptly investigate and identify cases to reduce the spread of scabies outbreak. 7. Crusted scabies, also know n as Norwegian scabies, is a more severe form of scabies in which there are large amounts of mi tes and eggs (up to 2 million mites may be found) contained in the skin growths. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 20202022 C16 Scabies Management Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 9 Page 2 of 9 a. Crusted scabies occurs more frequent ly in those with a weakened immune system, a neurological disease, the elderly and those with physical and mental disabilities. Crusted scabies may require more prolonge d treatments due to th e large number of mites and eggs. b. Crusted scabies is considered to be ve ry contagious to others and may transmit the mites through direct or indi rect contact by shedding mites on clothing, bedding and furniture. PURPOSE: To promptly identify, treat, and reportThe purpose of this poli cy is to provide information to Healthcare workers (HCW) to aid in the surveillance of scabies infections to preventfor prompt identification, and treatment thereby reducing transmission to others. PROCEDURE: 1. Suspicious rashes shall be promptly assessed by the licensed nurse and physician and infection control shall be notified when scabies is being ruled out. 1. The Prevention through Education a. Human scabies is caused by an infe station of the skin by the human itch mite (Sarcoptes scabiei var. homin is). The microscopic scabies mite burrows into the upper layer of the skin where it lives and lays its eggs b. The most common symptoms of scabi es includes itching and a skin rash, caused by sensitization to t he proteins of the parasite. c. Severe itching (pruritus) is t he earliest and most common symptom of scabies: i. night shift HCW are often the fi rst to be alerted to symptoms of nocturnal restlessness, scratching, and complaints of itching as the mite become more active at night ii. screening during shower is an e ffective method to assess between the folds of skin where the mite often burrows d. Scabies is easily transmissible in close living conditions and HCW's must utilize Standard Precautions for all resident care e. Transmission-based precautions (TBP) should be added for suspicion of scabies until ruled out f. Scabies is not indicative of hygi ene practices or cleanliness- handwashing alone will not prevent the transmission of scabies g. Scabies is more prevalent in cong regate settings such as long-term care and suspicious rashes should be report ed immediately to the physician to rule out scabies 2. Two forms of Scabies a. Non-crusted Scabies i. The more common, milder form of scabies File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual 13, 20202022 C16 Scabies Management Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 9 Page 3 of 9 ii. Is identifiable with symptoms of it ching with a rash that may represent only a few mites depending on the infestation iii. Can affect any age group but common in congregate close living environments such as nursing homes and schools iv. Is identifiable by the more co mmon symptoms of itching and rash generally found on hands, f eet, groin, breast ar eas, between fingers and toes b. Crusted (Norwegian) Scabies i. A more severe form of the same mi te infestation that primarily affects those who are immunocompromised, elderly, disabled, or debilitated ii. Crusted scabies present with thick crusts of skin that contain large numbers of scabies mites and eggs t hat resemble red or white scaly patches found on the hands, feet, knee s and elbow. In a severe form, the plaques can resemble a caul iflower-like appearanc e on the skin, hands, feet, elbows or knees. iii. Crusted Scabies is not associated with the severe itching or rash-like appearance of non-crusted scabies. iv. The mites in crusted scabies are not more virulent than in non- crusted scabies; however, they ar e much more numerous (up to 2 million per patient) and considered highly contagious . 3. Transmission a. Non-Crusted scabies is spread by direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact b. Crusted (Norwegian) scabies can be spread by indirect contact (clothes, bedding etc.) and may require a shor ter period of direct contact c. First-time infestations may take 2- 6 weeks for symptoms (pruritis and rash) to appear due to the initiation of the immune response but the individual may still spread the mite to others during this time d. Immunocompromised patient, the frail and elderly produce a less robust immune response and may not exhibit the usual symptoms of itching and rash. e. HCW should be alert for restless ness or other behaviors not normally observed and report suspicions to ICP team and medical provider for increased surveillance and monitoring. 4. Screening a. Skin assessment are performed upon adm ission or transf er from another facility b. Signs and Symptoms to r eport if scabies is suspected i. Non-crusted scabies : 1. Pruritis (intense itch ing) with Rash is the predominant symptom of scabies is pruritus accompanied by a rash. 2. Report suspicious rashes, particularly between fingers and toes, axilla, belt line, under breasts and perineal areas a.3. Rash: The scabies rash varies and may appear as small lines, red, raised bumps (p apules), pustules or blisters . File: 72-01 Infection 13, 20202022 C16 Scabies Management Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 4 of 9 Page 4 of 9 Crusted scabies or may appear as thick white or cream colored heavily crusted areas ofred or brown \"tracking\" where the mite burrows and moves under the skin instead of the typical tracking rash. ii. Itching Crusted scabies 1. Presents with less or no itching 2. Rash may appear as thick wh ite or cream co lored heavily crusted (dry) areas of the skin instead of the typical tracking rash 5. Treatment Options a. Non-crusted scabies i. For suspected or confirmed cases, initiate Transmission-based (Contact) Precautions until scabies is ruled out ii. Can be treated using a cream or lotion scabicide and applied as directed, usually twice per day iii. General instructions include applic ation of the medication over the external body from the neck dow n. It is important to use the medication as directed and using the amount specified over the entire external body as mites may migrate to unmedicated areas and cause re-infestation iv. The next day have the patient shower, change bed linens and wear clean clothing v. If a second application is require d, apply medication as directed and repeat the shower, change of bed linens and fresh clothing vi. Pain and discomfort (itching) shoul d also be considered for treatment vii. Monitor the patient for sec ondary bacterial skin infection from scratching viii. Report increased pain, fever, in creased redness, or discharge from the rash site to the physician. b. Crusted scabies i. For suspected or confirmed ca ses, initiate Transmission-based (Contact) Precautions until scabies is ruled out ii. Large numbers of mites create a very contagious condition resulting in the potential to spread scabies th rough only a brief direct skin-to- skin contact. iii. Patients with crusted scabies should receive quick and aggressive medical treatment for their infestation to prevent an outbreak of scabies iv. Treatment may include the use of a cream or lotion scabicide as well as oral treatments. v. Treatments may be prolonged unt il the physician has determined there is no longer any mites present File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 20202022 C16 Scabies Management Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 5 of 9 Page 5 of 9 vi. Nursing will confer with t he ICP team and physician before discontinuing Transmission-based (Contact) Precautions TBP may be in place for extended periods (months) of time for severe cases. Monitor the patient for secondary bacterial skin infection from scratching Report increased pain, fever, increased redness, or discharge from the rash site to the physician. 6. Outbreak Management a. Definition of Outbreak i. Two (2) or more intense confirmed cases OR b.ii. One (1) confirmed case and at night.least two (2) suspect cases occurring among residents, health care workers (HCW), visitors or volunteers during a 2-week period should be considered an outbreak of scabies b. Contact ICP team immediately with su spected cases for considerations of isolation precautions based on each i ndividual care needs including TBP and Personal protective equipment (PPE) required c. Contact the physician for skin te sting if needed, and begin treatments- aggressive treatments shoul d be considered for crusted scabies including comfort measures for pain and itching d. ICP will report the scabies outbreak to the local and state health department per CDPH title 17 California Code of Regulations \u00a72500 that requires facilities to report outbreaks e. ICP will collaborate with nursing st aff to coordinate additional skin assessment needs for others on the unit including HCW for potential contact f. Notification of the clinical, medi cal, pharmaceutical and EVS leadership for potential contact tracing needs and fo r resources should additional cases be identified g. Contact Precautions may be required for up to several weeks until the determination is made that the mi tes have been eradicated. This may require both oral and topical scabi cidal medications with repeated applications and/or other antipruritic/ anti-inflammatory medications for secondary infections c. Itching may be absent in immunoc ompromised residents and persons with decreased sensation and/ or decreased cognition. d. Scabies rashes are usually found between t he webs of the finger s, front of wrists, elbows, axilla, belt line, thighs, genitali a, female breast, abdomen, male genitals and the lower portion of the buttocks. Some lesions may be more predominant on the areas of the skin havi ng contact with moist sheet s such as the back and buttocks. When 7. HCW/Staff Exposure or Diagnosis: File: 72-01 Infection Manual 13, 20202022 C16 Scabies Management Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 6 of 9 Page 6 of 9 a. Staff must report any known exposure to their supervisor/ICP team such as family members living in the same home as soon as possible b. Nurse management will refer exposed staff to Occupational Health for further diagnosis and/or treatment options c. Staff may not return to work until cleared by Occupational Health d. Nurse manager will report t he exposure to the ICP/team 8. Patient Exposure or Diagnosis a. ICP team and medical provider will be notified immediately for a patient scabies is firstdiagnosis or suspected and continuing throughout diagnosis and treatment of confirmed scabies, Nu rsing staff are to observe case b. Contact Precautions will be implemented without delay for suspected cases even without a diagnosis c. The medical provider will determi ne testing needs which may include skin scrapings, but treatment should not be delayed while awaiting results 2.d. Rooms used by a patient with crus ted scabies should be thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed daily during resident care activities. treatment and while in Contact Precautions a. This period of Contact Precautions includes 24 hours after initial and subsequent administration of a scabici de (per CDPH guidelines) or until the physician has determined that the infestation has s ubsided, and the resident is no longer infectious to others. Transmission of scabies occu rs primarily through prolon ged skin-to-skin contact with a person who has scabies. b. Crusted scabies is considered highly contagious and can also be transmitted by indirect contact with an infested pers on's clothing, bedding, or towels. 3. Shorter periods of skin-to-skin contact with a person with crusted scabies may result in transmission. e. When scabies is suspected, the lic ensed nurse is to notify the physician and the infection control nurse. A skin scraping is used to positively confirm the diagnosis. Terminal cleani ng requires thorough cleaning and vacuuming and after use but environment al disinfestation using pesticide sprays or fogs generally is unnecessary f. Contact the local / state health department for cont rol measures if continuous transmission or frequent outbreaks are occurring. 9. Treatment 4. Crusted scabies may not require skin scrapings due to the characteristic skin formation. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 20202022 C16 Scabies Management Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 7 of 9 Page 7 of 9 5.a. Empirical treatment mayshould be initiated before the lab results are available for highly suspicious rashes or crusted growths. 6. A physician who has been pr operly trained to perform skin scrapings may do so to expedite the diagnosis. Resident skin scrapings can be scheduled at the Outpatient Medical Clinic. b. Notify pharmacy department for potential large volume medication needs c. A physician's order is required for treatment following current CDC guidelines for appropriate medications d. Mass treatment may be required fo r large exposures/outbreaks and will be managed in conjunction with the medical team and local health department e. Pharmacy will provide support for bul k orders in the event of outbreak f. Treatments and Contact Precautions will be discontinued on a case-by- case when there is no further evidence of transmission or active disease as determined by the physician in collaboration with ICP. g. Considerations for discontinuing C ontact Precautions include but are not limited to infestation type, cognitive abili ty of the patient to effectively and consistently adhere to precautions, new infection versus re-infection, co- morbidities of the pati ent and immune response. 10. Cleaning and Disinfection a. Considerations for EVS cleaning and disinfection practices will include a single case of non-crust ed, any crusted (Norwegi an) case(s), and outbreak 7.b. After a diagnosis of scabies infestat ion is made either by suspicious rash, skin scraping or both, notify nei ghborhood staff, including EVS, in order to coordinate interventions. a. One case of non-crusted scabies wit h a negative skin scraping may not need interventions beyond treatment of the one case and thei r environment including Contact Precautions until 24 hours after treatment. b. One or more cases of crusted scabies or non-crusted scabies confirmed by skin scraping requires contact investigation an d treatment of close contacts and additional prophylactic tr eatment for crusted scabies including Contact Precautions until deem ed non-infectious. c. If more than one case of scabies is diagnosed within 2 weeks of another case among residents, staff, or visitors, then coordination among interdisciplinary department heads/ des ignees is warranted following A8 Outbreak/Epidemic Investigation Protocol and A9 Contact/Exposure Investigation. 8. A physician's order is required for tr eatment; follow current CDC guidelines for appropriate medications. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 20202022 C16 Scabies Management Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 8 of 9 Page 8 of 9 a. For mass treatment, pre-printed or ders may be provided by pharmacy. b. Follow package instructions for pr escribed treatment(s) unless otherwise ordered. c. After incontinent care, reapply a thin la yer of scabicide during treatment period. d. Maintain Contact Precautions until treat ment is completed and the resident is no longer considered to be infectious. i. For treatment of common scabies, C ontact Precautions may be discontinued when successful treatment has been completed. ii. For treatment of crusted scabies, Contact Precautions may be required for up to several weeks until the determination is made that the mites have been eradicated. This may require both oral and topical scabicidal medications with repeated applications and/or other antipruritic/anti-inflammatory medications for secondary infections . 9.d. Bedding, clothing, and towels us ed by infested persons or their household, sexual, and close contract s anytime during the 3 days before treatment should be decontaminated by machine washing in hot water and drying using the hot dryer cycle (or dry clean). a.e. Items that cannot be laundered can be treated by storing in a closed plastic bag for one week. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2-3 days away from human skin. b.f. Change all bed linens before returning re sident to bed after the scabicide has been showered off 8-14 hours after application. 10.g. Environmental cleaning of rooms used by residents with scabies includes thorough cleaning and vac uuming by personnel wearing long sleeved gown and gloves. a.h. In addition to bed stripping and bedsi de cleaning, Nursing staff shall replace disposable personal care item s such as oral hygiene equipment, water pitcher, urinal/ bedpan and personal disposable blood pressure cuff. b.i. Usual disinfection is adequate for non- disposable items, such as wheelchairs, glasses. Disinfect wheelc hair according to usual wheelchair cleaning procedure. c. EVS shall clean the room and bathroom, including chairs and toilet seats, according to usual procedures and remove and replace the cubicle curtains in the room and bathroom. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 20202022 C16 Scabies Management Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 9 of 9 Page 9 of 9 d.j. Request for vacuuming of upholstered su rfaces that may have come in contact with infested or exposed resident (s). Use dedicated vacuum; empty bag and wipe down vacuum when finished vacuuming. 11.k. Post-treatment assessment is c onducted by the Infection Control Nurse to determine if treatment was effe ctive. The intensit y of the rash and pruritus should gradually resolve over a 7-14 day period. Crusted scabies may require multimodal treatments, longer periods of contact isolation and a longer time for sympto ms to resolve. If signs and symptoms persist or intensify or if new lesions are identif ied within 7-14 days, treatment failure should be considered, and altern ative treatments applied. 12.l. Document in the electronic health record procedures, medications used, description of resident's skin and reaction to treatment. Record and describe any allergic symptom s or persistent pruritis. 13.m. Nursing completes an Unusual O ccurrence report. Include skin description and any medication prescri bed. If this is a newly admitted resident, include the name of the facility and the unit the resident came from. ATTACHMENT: None.

Residents are to be screenedAdmission screeni ng is performed, including observing the skin and hair for abnormalities that may including evidence of lice infestation by the licensed nurse upon admissi on, preferably before being transferred into a bed.. 2. A licensed nurse or physici an will promptly assess any resident with symptoms of a lice infestation. 3.2. The Infection Control Nurse is to be info rmed of suspected or confirmed cases of lice for room placement options. Private r oom with a private bathr oom is preferred. 4.3. Contact Precautions and covering all hair sources (e .g. head hair, facial hair) are toshould be implemented promptly forwhen lice is suspected or confirmed cases including appropriate use of gloves when providing direct care until and continued for 24 hourshrs. post-treatment. Re-t reatment may be needed 9-10 days after initiation of pediculosis therapy and no live lice detected. initial treatment but Contact Precautions are not required after the initial treatment. DEFINITONS: TheThere are three (3) distinct types of lice that are human parasites: body lice, head lice, and pubic \"crab\" lice. There are three formsTreatments will be specific to the type of lice (see reference link to photograph of actual si ze of three lice forms compared toafter a penny):diagnosis is made by a health care professional trained in identifying. Life cycle stages are important considerations for treatment options. 1. Live Cycle Stages: 1.a. Nits: Nits are lice eggs. They can be hard to see and are found firmly attached to the hair shaft. They are ov al-shaped and very small (about the size of a knot in thread), hard to see, and are usually yellow to white. 2.b. Nymph : A nymph is an immature louse t hat hatches from the nit. A nymph looks like an adult head louse but is smaller. 3.c. Adult : An adult hair and body louse is about the size of a sesame seed, has six legs, and is tan to grayish-white in color. An adult pubic louse resembles a miniature crab when viewed through a str ong magnifying glass. Pubic lice have six legs; their two front legs are very large and look like the pincher claws of a crab. Pubic lice are tan to grayish-white in color. 2. Transmission and Disease: File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised C17 Pediculosis Management Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 9 a. Head and pubic lice are not known to spread disease. The itching may lead to excessive scratching that can someti mes increase the chance of a secondary skin infection. b. Body lice can spread epidemic typhus, trenc h fever, and louse-borne relapsing fever, all which are no longer widespread. Body, head, and pubic lice are transm itted in the following ways: 1.c. Body Lice: Spread through direct physical contact with a person who has body lice or through contact with articles such as clothing, beds, bed linens, or towels that have been in cont act with an infested person. 2.d. Head Lice: Usually spread by head- to-head contact with an already infested person. Head lice can also be spr ead by sharing clothing or belongings. This happens when lice crawl, or nits a ttached to shed hair hatch, and get on the shared clothing or belongings. 3.e. Pubic Lice: Usually spread through sex ual contact. Pubic lice can also be spread by close personal contact or contac t with articles such as clothing, bed linens, or towels that have been used by an infested person. 3. Signs and symptoms of body, head, and pubic lice include the following: 1.a. Body Lice : Intense itching or pruritus and rash caused by an allergic reaction to the louse bites are common symptoms. When body lice in festation has been present for a long time, heavily bitten areas of the skin can become thickened and discolored, particularly around the midsection of the body (waist, groin, upper thighs); this condition is called \"vagabond's disease.\" 2.b. Head Lice : Tickling feeling of something movi ng in the hair, itching caused by an allergic reaction to the bites of the head l ouse, irritability and difficulty sleeping as head lice are most active in the dark, a nd sores on the head caused by scratching. 3.c. Pubic Lice : Itching in the genital area and visible nits (lice eggs) or crawling lice. PURPOSE: To promptly identify, treat, and report lice infe stations to prevent transmission to others. PROCEDURE: 1. Nursing obtains lice treatment and baby shampoo without condition er order from the physician for a topical lice medication. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 202016, 2022 C17 Pediculosis Management Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 9 a. The hospital-wide combination sham poo/conditioner has a conditioner and cannot be used. Shampoos a resident may own that do not have a conditioner may be used instead of baby shampoo. b. The physician may opt for an oral lice medi cation only if a topi cal treatment is not recommended. 2. Nursing obtains the fo llowing items needed for a topica l lice treatment from the neighborhood, Pharmacy, and/or Central Processing Department: a. Head Lice medication (Pharmacy) : b. Fine tooth comb (Pharmacy) c. Shall baby shampoo bottle without conditioner if resident does not have their own supply of shampoo as hospital-wide comb ination shampoo/condi tioner cannot be used (Pharmacy) d. Nail clipper (Central Processi ng Department or neighborhood supply) e. Disposable gloves (neighborhood supply) f. Disposable isolation gowns (neighborhood supply) g. Disposable suture kit scissors if resident requests to have hair cut short (Central Processing Department or neighborhood supply) 3. Keep resident's fingernails short to mi nimize damage to the skin from itching. 4. If requested by the resident, hair may be cut short using disposable scissors before washing hair and applying lice medication by Nursing. Disposable scissors can be found in suture removal kits supplied by Central Processing Department in the medication room storage trays. a. Disposable scissors can be found in sutu re removal kits supplied by Central Processing Department in medication r oom storage trays. Used disposable scissors are disposed inside t he room's sharps container. b. Cut hair shall be double bagged a nd disposed inside the room. c. Do not ask the barber or beautician to cut lice infested hair until it has resolved (i.e. 24 hours from after initiation of pedi culosis therapy and no live lice detected). 5. Hair should be shampooed without a conditi oner, rinsed, and towel dried (do not blow dry) before lice medi cation is applied. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised 202016, 2022 C17 Pediculosis Management Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 4 of 9 a. Do not use a combination shampoo/conditi oner or conditioner before using lice medication as it decreases the effectiveness of the me dication staying on the hair. 6. Apply the prescribed lice medication onto t he affected area(s) according to the label instructions or as di rected by the physician. 7. Remove nits by combing through hair with a fine tooth comb: a. Part the hair into 4 sections. Work on one section at a time. Longer hair may take more time (1-2 hours). b. Start at the top of t he head on the section you have picked. With one hand, lift a 1-2 inch wide strand of hair. Get the teeth of the comb as close to the scalp as possible and comb with a firm, even moti on away from the scalp to the end of the hair. c. Make sure the hair remains slightly damp while removing nits. If the hair dries during combing, dampen it slightly with water. d. Clean the comb completely as you go. Wipe the nits from the comb with a tissue and throw away the tissue in a sealed plasti c bag to prevent the lice from coming back. e. After combing, recheck the entire head fo r nits and repeat combing if necessary. 8. Check the hair daily to remove any rema ining nits or lice with a fine tooth comb. 9. Do not re-wash the hair for 1-2 days a fter treatment. If no dead lice are found 8-12 hours after treatment and lice activity has not decreased, the treatment may not be effective. Notify the physician and follow additional treatment inst ructions if ordered. 10. If live lice are seen seven days or more a fter the first treatmen t, a second treatment should be ordered by the physician. 11. Strip linen from resident's bed, clean and disinfect the bed, and replace with clean linen. Double bag all dirty linen in a regular dirty linen bag. Close the bags securely and place them in the linen chute. 1. Do not transmit communicable diseases 2. Do not jump or fly; they can only crawl. 3. Prevalence of infestation is no different in individuals with long hair than in those with short hair; cutting hair is not necessary to control head lice 4. Seldom occur on eyebrows or eyelashes File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 202016, 2022 C17 Pediculosis Management Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 5 of 9 5. Infest persons from all socioeconomic le vels, without regard for age, race, sex or standards of personal hygiene. 6. Do not come from animals or pets 7. Not usually spread by contact with clot hing (such as hats, scarves, coats) or other personal items (such as co mbs, brushes, or towels). 8. Is diagnosed best by finding a live nym ph or adult louse on the scalp or hair of a person. a. Because nymphs and adult lice are very small, move quickly, and avoid light, they can be difficult to find. b. Use of a magnifying lens and a fine- toothed comb may be helpful to find live lice. 9. Can also be diagnosed if crawling lice are not seen. Finding eggs (also called nits) firmly attached within a 1/4 inch of base of the hair shafts strongly suggests, but does not confirm, that a person is infested and should be treated. Eggs (also called nits) 12. Machine wash and dry all resident's personal clothing used by the infested person in the 2-day period just before tr eatment is started using the hot water and hot air cycles to kill lice and nits. 13. Dispose and replace all personal items fo r the resident (e.g. water pitcher, comb, toothbrush). 10. Items that cannot be laundered are attached more than 1/4 inch from the base of the hair shaft are almost always dead or replaced (e.g. personal hairbrush)already hatched. 11. Eggs are often confused with other things found in the hair such as dandruff, hair spray droplets, and dirt particles. 12. If no live nymphs or adult lice are s een, and the only eggs found are more than 1/4 inch from the scalp, the infestati on is probably old and no longer active and does not need to be treated. 13. Diagnosis should be made by a healthcare provider, or other person trained to identify live head lice. Treatment for HEAD LICE 1. Staff who are pregnant or nursing should be double bagged in a regular plastic bag not come into contact with topical m edications containing malathion, Check the labels for ingredients and cons ider non-pregnant/ non-nursing staff for treatment options. 2. Treatment for head lice is recommended for patients diagnosed with an active infestation File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 202016, 2022 C17 Pediculosis Management Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 6 of 9 3. Before applying treatment, remove cl othing that can become wet or stained during treatment and use a hospita l gown during treatment period. 4. Do Not shampoo hair prior to treatment; Follow the directions on the label. Many treatments must be ap plied to dry hair. 14.5. Don proper PPE including gown and gloves for two weeks.Contact Precautions 6. Disinfect any equipmentObtain lice medicine, also called pediculicide and items useduse as directed. a. Review the directions contained in t he box or printed on the label prior to beginning treatment; do not assume all treatments are the same as treatments vary by the resident (e.g. wheel chair, commode, call light)manufacturers. b. Improper application may result in the medication not being effective c. A second bottle of pediculicide may be required for very long hair (greater than shoulder length). Obtain a second bottle before beginning treatment if indicated. d. Follow the directions closely on the label or in the box regarding how long the medication should be left on the hair and how it should be washed out, usually after 8-12 hours . e. Use the full amount listed on the label to treat; do not attempt to \"save\" or \"split the dose\" of the medication i. Not using the proper amount may lead to the treatment not completely killing the lice f. For liquid medications/lotions: gener ally, coat the hai r until thoroughly wetted with the standard hospital-widemedication being particularly careful behind the ear and on the back of the head and neck g. The manufacturer generally recomm ends leaving the medication on the hair, uncovered, for 8-12 hours. h. Allow the hair to dry naturally; do not use an electrical heat source, including a hair dryer or curli ng iron while the hair is wet. i. Do not cover the head with plastic or shower caps j. Shoulders should be covered wit h a towel to prevent dripping k. Have the patient put on clean cl othing once the medication has been applied / dry. i. Consider treating just befor e bedtime allowing time for the lotion/medication to dry before retiring to bed, depending on hair length ii. Do not place medication / loti on on other areas of hair on the body (eyebrows, pubic area, chest, under arms) iii. Avoid medication near eyes l. Remove and discard PPE after treatment; perform HH File: 72-01 Infection Control C17 Pediculosis Management Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 7 of 9 m. In 8-12 hours or next morning, Don PPE for Contact Precautions prior to continuing treatment in cluding gown and gloves n. After 8-12 hours thoroughly shampoo the hair (the shower is preferred) i. rinse well and ii. use a fine-toothed nit comb, usually included in the package, to remove dead lice and nits from the hair. iii. if a second treatment is required, the physician will need to re-order the second application, either the same or a different type and use according to manufacturers directions o. Have the patient wear clean clot hes and change the bed linens before re- entering the bed 7. Retreatment of head lice a. Is usually is recommended 9-10 days after initial treatment because no approved pediculicide is completely ovicidal (able to kill unhatched nits). b. To be most effective, retreatment should occur after all eggs have hatched but before new eggs are produced. c. The retreatment schedule can va ry depending on the pediculicide used. Follow the directions on the l abel/ manufacturers directions. 8. Laundry and EVS Measures: a. Machine wash and dry disinfectantclothing, b ed linens, and other items that the patient wore or used during the 2 days be fore treatment using the hot water (130\u00b0F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle. b. Clothing and items that are not washable can be dry-cleaned OR sealed in a plastic bag and stored for 2 weeks. c. Soak combs and brushes in hot wa ter (at least 130\u00b0F) for 5-10 minutes. Do not share combs. d. Vacuum the floor and furniture, part icularly where the infested person sat or lay. However, the risk of getting in fested by a louse that has fallen onto a rug or carpet or furniture is very small. Head lice survive less than 1-2 days if they fall off a person and cannot feed; e. Nits cannot hatch and usually die within a week if t hey are not kept at the same temperature as that f ound close to the human scalp. 15.f. Do not use fumigant sprays; they can be toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin . 16.9. Document in the electronic health re cord procedures, medications used, description of the resident's skin and reaction to treatment. Record and describe any allergic symptoms. 17.10. NursingIf the resident has a reaction to treatment, nursing completes an Unusual Occurrence report. Include hair and skin description and any medication File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 202016, 2022 C17 Pediculosis Management Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 8 of 9 prescribed. If this is a newly admitted resident, include the name of the facility and the unit the resident came from. Body Lice Treatment a. Improved hygiene and access to regular changes of clean clothes is the only treatment needed for body lice infestations. b. Contact Precautions will be in effect until the IP nurse/ team collaborate with the physician when precaut ions may be discontinued. Pubic Lice Treatment 1. Contact Precautions should be in effect during the treatment period; Contact the IP nurse/ team to collaborate with physician when precautions may be discontinued 2. Treatments should be init iated as soon as possible after diagnosis is made 3. Don appropriate PPE for Contact Prec autions including gown and gloves 4. Wash the infested area; towel dry. 5. Carefully follow the instructions in the package or on t he label. Thoroughly saturate the pubic hair and other infest ed areas with lice medication. Leave medication on hair for the time recommended in the instructions. After waiting the recommended time, remove the medication by following carefully the instructions on the label or in the box. 6. Following treatment, most nits will st ill be attached to hair shafts. Nits may be removed by using a fine-toothed comb. 7. Have the patient put on clean under wear and clothing after treatment. 8. To kill any lice or nits remaining on clothing, towels, or bedding, machine-wash and machine-dry those items that the infested person used during the 2-3 days before treatment. Use hot water (at least 130\u00b0F) and the hot dryer cycle. 9. Items that cannot be l aundered can be dry-cleaned or st ored in a sealed plastic bag for 2 weeks. 10. All sex partners from wit hin the previous month shoul d be informed that they are at risk for infestation and should be treated. 11. Persons should avoid sexual contact with their sex partner(s) until both they and their partners have been successfully treated and reevaluated to rule out persistent infestation. 12. Repeat treatment in 9-10 da ys if live lice are still found. 13. Persons with pubic lice should be eval uated for other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). 14. For lice or nits on the eyelashes, careful application of ophthalmic-grade petrolatum ointment to the eyelid ma rgins 2-4 times a day for 10 days is effective. Regular petrolatum (e.g., Va seline)* should not be used because it can irritate the eyes if applied. ATTACHMENT: None.

Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilit ation Center (LHH) will provide prevention measures through education to HCP to identify , report, and manage Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection according to this policy and in in accordance with Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines . 2.1. Ongoing prevention of C. diff shall be addressed through surveillance and antimicrobial stewardship effo rts along and in collaboration with a rigorous hand hygiene program.the Infection Prevent ionist (IP) and medical staff. 3. According to the CDC, C. diff is a highly contagious bacteri um that causes diarrhea and colitis (an inflammation of the colon). Risk factors include those who are age >65, recent hospitalization (that ma y or may not include extensive use of antibiotics), long term use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPI s) or H2 blockers, weakened immune system and previous C. diff infection or k nown exposure. 4. C. diff bacteria is shed in feces. Any surfaces that come into cont act with contaminated feces can serve as a reservoir for th e bacterium and may be transferred via contaminated hands/gloves of healthcare worker s to others. Scrupulous use of proper personal protective equipment (PPE) and hand hygiene with soap and water only is required to prevent spreading the disease to others. PURPOSE: To provide guidance for the prevention , assessment and management of outbreaks of Clostridioides difficile infection in accordance with current guidelines and evidence-based sources.practices (EBP) provided by t he Centers for Disease & Control (CDC). PROCEDURE: A. Prevention 1. Education of HCP regarding the spread, prevention measures, personal protective equipment (PPE) use dur ing care and management of outbreaks 2. Education of patients to reduce transmission to others including hand washing with soap and water after toileting, showering and clothing changes 3. Clostridiodes difficile (C.diff) is a highly contagious bacte rium that causes severe diarrhea 4. Risk factors include i) age >65 but especially in >85 age group ii) recent hospitalization (that may or may not include ex tensive use of antibiotics) iii) long term use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 blockers that serve to reduce stomach acid production File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October Clostridioides Difficile Guidelines Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 7 iv) weakened immune system as occurs with HIV/AIDS, cancer or organ transplant recipients and use of steroids v) previous C. diff infection or known exposure 5. C. diff bacteria is shed in feces and can survive on skin even when visible soiling is not evident 6. C. diff is spread by direct and indirect contact with the microorganism 7. Implement daily and terminal cleaning of rooms using EPA approved disinfectants for C. diff B. Symptoms of C. diff may include Infection (CDI) 1. loose , watery stools , (typically more than three in a 24 hour period of time) 2. Colitis - severe bowel inflammation 3. fever , 4. stomach pain or tenderness , 5. loss of appetite and/or /dehydration 6. nausea . A thorough assessment of 1.7. symptoms should be documentedrecorded in the medical record including any evidence of recent exposure and/or previous C. diff infections. B. Care providers will adhere to current practices to prevent C. diff infection and colonization that includes but is not limited to performing appropriate hand hygiene, consistent use of Standard Precautions, appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and judicious use of antibiotics. 8. Contact Three (3) or more stools in 24 hour period: i) Contact provider without delay regardi ng suspicion of CDI for further testing and empirical treatment before test results are known. ii) Contact IP/team for follow up iii) Implement Contact Precautions without delay including gloving with every patient care interaction (even if shor t), and/or contact with patient items iv) Contact EVS to clean high touch room surfac es thoroughly on a twice daily basis and upon patient discharge or transfer using an EPA- approved disinfectant with sporicidal kill claims. v) In the event of a patient transfers (s uch as hospital or new facility), notify the new facility if the patient has or had a CDI C. Standard Precautions 1. During every patient contact 2. When unexpected or watery diarrhea is observed, consider CDI as a potential diagnosis and implement contact precautions to prevent transmission of CDI until diagnosis is ruled out 3. Hand washing using soap and water (c. diff is an anaerobic spor e-forming bacteria and does not respond to alcohol-based gels) File: 72-01 Infection Clostridioides Difficile Guidelines Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 7 4. Meticulous hand washing with soap and wa ter, glove and gown use for any patient care interactions - eye protection may be needed D. Transmission-based Precautions Implementation 1. Enhanced Contact Precautions shall will be observed implemented from the time that new or worsening diarrhea that cannot be contained is noted . Contact 3.2. Enhanced Contact Precautions shall be initiated for any unexplained or watery diarrhea and shall not be delayed pendi ng culture results, according to LHH guidelines for diarrheal illness and C. diff infection (72-01 C1 Alphabetical List of Diseases/Conditions with Required Precautions) that include including but are not limited to: a. Provide a private room with private bathroom, as described below. i.i) A private room with a private bathroom is necessary to prevent the spread of C. diff spores to environmental surf aces during showering and toileting. ii. If a private room with a private bath room cannot be provided then residents with C. diff infection or colonization may be cohortedco-horted in the same room or in closed double or triple rooms. b.ii) Notify the Infection Control Nurseas long as soon as reasonable and place a Contact Enhanced Precaution sign on or next to the outsidethey do not have additional infectious concerns (presence of the door. multiple drug resistant organisms.) 3. Place an isolation cart outside of the room stocked with gowns and gloves at minimum. Add face shields if procedures that may splatter. Post contact enhanced precautions signs on door entrance 4. Remove alcohol-based hand wipes from cart if present - Wash hands with soap and water only. Alcohol-based hand rub is not effective against C. diff spores. ; bleach-based c. Use an Environmental Protection Agen cy (EPA)-registered disinfectant with a sporicidal claim for environment al surface disinfection after cleaning products in accordance with label instructi ons. (Note: Only hospital su rface disinfectants listed on EPA's List K are required to eliminate r egistered as effective against C. diff spores . d.5. Place bleach wipes on cart and use). Use to disinfect high touch surfaces at least twice daily, including but not lim ited to call light, bed rails, door handles, and faucets. e. Use bleach solution for daily cleaning by EVS staff. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Clostridioides Difficile Guidelines Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 4 of 7 f. Wash hands with soap and water only. Al cohol-based hand rub is not effective against C. diff spores. 6. Provide dedicated equipm ent that is disposable orif possible g.7. Do not removedremove medical equipment from the room until Contact Enhanced Precautions are lifted, and the equipment is cleaned with a bleach basedan EPA-approv ed sporicidal product (e.g., vital signs equipment and ADL assistive devices). h.8. Nursing staff will communicate need for Contact Enhanced Precautions to resident, visitors, and EVS. Educate as appr opriate to the level of contact and understanding. E. Outbreak Management 1. An outbreak of C. diff infection is defined as th ree (3) or more cases of C. diff infection (CDI) occurring in the same area/ unit of the facility within a period of six (6) days or less. i. Before entering room, wash hands wit h soap and water, don gown, then gloves. j. Before leaving room, remove and di scard gloves, then gown, then wash hands with soap and water. D. Cultures for C. diff are processed using watery, unfo rmed or loose stool specimen less than 24 hours old. Specimen collection should be placed in a clean, watertight container without preservative. Refrigerate specimens at 4 C pending testing. (The microbiology lab will not proc ess formed stool specimens). a. Retesting to verify treatment effect or to screen asymptom atic residents is not advised as colonization can be long lasti ng without the resident being infectious 2. Notify the Infection Control Nurse (ICN) of cultures positive for C. Contact the Infection Prevent ionist (Nursing Ops during weekends/off shifts) for outbreaks. 3. The IP will report to SFDPH followi ng A8 Outbreak/Epidemic Investigation Protocol. b. diff. ICN is also informed via daily culture reports. 5.4. Group activities and non-essentia l appointments s hould be postponed while the resident (s) has diarrhea that cannot be easily and reliably contained. a. Dialysis Centers do not generally accept residents with active C. diff infection until 48 hours without diarrhea and 5 days of therapy, ther efore clinical and lab File: 72-01 Infection Clostridioides Difficile Guidelines Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 5 of 7 monitoring to evaluate the need for ac ute hospitalization and dialysis is necessary. b.5. For essential appointments or transfe r to another facility, alert the receiving staff, dress resident in clean clothing and contain incontinence (e.g., with adult briefs). Alert facilit y about the need for Contact Enhanced Precautions. F. Disinfection 1. C. difficile spores can survive in the environ ment for months or years due to their resistance to heat, drying, and certain disinfectants. 2. Patient room surface environmen t is frequently contaminated with C. difficile , including floors, commodes, toilets, bedpans, and high-touch surfaces, such as call bells and overbed tables (2018 Pubmed) 3. Surfaces should be kept clean, and body substa nce spills should be managed promptly 4. Routine cleaning shou ld be performed prior to disinfection. F. EPA-registered disinfectants with a sporic idal claim have been used with success for environmental surface disinfection in those patient-care areas where surveillance and epidemiology in dicate ongoing transmission of C. diff .Contact Enhanced Precautions may be lifted once t he resident has completed 5 days of treatment and has had no diarrhea for at least 48 hours. Notify the ICN for guidance to discontinue Contact Enhanced Precautions. 5. 6. EPA-registered disinfectants (List K) are recommended for use in patient- care areas. Follow product labels for inactivation claims, indications for use, and instructions. G. C. diff colonization (also known as c. diff carriers) 1. Colonization of c.diff m eans that the person has the c.diff bacteria by coming into contact with someone with c.dff but they do not have the infection. 2. Colonization with C. diff is more common than infection and may remain colonized for several months 3. No treatment is required for colonization of c.diff 4. It is possible to transmit C. diff to others when colonized and good hand washing with soap and water after using the bathroom is required 5. Colonized patients do not have disease caused by C. diff and often exhibit NO clinical symptoms (asymptomatic) of infection (e.g., diarrhea) 6. Colonized patients do test positive for the C. diff organism or its toxin File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual October Clostridioides Difficile Guidelines Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 6 of 7 7. The difference is that patients with CDI infection exhibit clinical symptoms and test positive for the C. diff organism or its toxin 8. Because there is remains the poten tial of transmission with c.diff colonization, discontinuing contac t precautions will be made in collaboration with nursing, IP, and medical staff care team based upon the patients ability to comply with ha ndwashing and other precautions. 7.An outbreak of C. diff infection is defined as th ree (3) or more cases of C. diff infection (CDI) occurring in the same area/ unit of the facility within a period of six (6) days or less. a. Notify the Infect ion Control Nurse. b. Cohort infected residents and impl ement consistent staffing. c. Implement Contact Enhanced Precaut ions as for an individual case. d. Report to SFDPH Communicable Disease Prevention and Control unit at (415) 554-2830 within 24 hours if outbreak occurs during weekend or evenings following A8 Outbreak/Epidemic Investigation Protocol. e.

Laguna Honda Hospital (LHH) residents who meetwill be provided the established Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) clinical cr iteria shall be screened or evaluated for thecurrent influenza vaccine seasonally October 1 through March 31, subject to the status of upon their consent during the influenza season within the community.which is generally Oc tober to March of each year. 2. Before offering the influenza vaccine, the resident or responsible party has the opportunity to refuse the immunization. Using the Standard Influenza Vaccination Prot ocol, the LHH RN may order influenza vaccinations under specific crit eria provided in this policy. Those patients not meeting that protocol criteria will be referr ed to a prescriber for follow up. 3.2. The resident's electronic health record will include documentation indicating education provided and if the resident received the influenza vaccine or did not due to medical contraindication or refusal. PURPOSE: To reduce morbidity and mortality from influenza, residents who meet t he clinical criteria established by the CDC will be vacci nated with the influenza vaccine. The purpose of this policy is to provide HCP information for administration of the annual influenza vaccine to patients / responsible par ties including education, annual consent, reporting and documentation. PROCEDURE: Standard RN protocol for ordering influenza va ccine annually for patients residing at LHH includes: 1. The Registered Nurse (RN) screens upon admission during the influenza season and current in-house residents at the start of the influenza season to order the influenza vaccine using the St andardized Procedur e Allowing a Regi stered Nurse to Order Influenza Vaccines for Residents Admitted to LHH. a. The If any of the following are criteria for failsapplicable to meet criteria for the patient, the LHH RN tomay not order an influenza vaccine but must obtain a physician consultation pr ior to administration : i.

Laguna Honda Hospital (LHH) must abide byis required to adhere to the California state law (SB739) requiring hospitals and like facilities to offer influenza vaccines free of cost to all employees. Em ployees are required to either get vaccinatedreceive the annual influenza vaccine or sign a declination statement and follow additional precautions during periods of high viral circulation . 2. LHH is also underwill adhere to the local health depar tment, San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), t hat requires all San Francisco hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and other long-term care facilities to implement mandatory masking of unvaccinated employees in patien t care areas during the defined influenza season for the current season. 3. All LHH employees shall be provi ded an influenza vaccine, unless medically contraindicated during the influenza season as defined by the local health department. 4. Directors, supervisors, and managers are re sponsible for enforcing and monitoring masking compliance by unvaccinated em ployees during the influenza season. 5. Repeated non-compliance wit h masking by an unvaccinated employeesemployee during the influenza season shallmay result in disciplinary action according toas defined by the Human Resources departmental procedures for repeated non- compliance . PURPOSE: 1. Provide explicit standards for all em ployees regarding required documentation of influenza vaccination or influenza vaccine declination. 2. Ensure directors, supervisors, and m anagers are informed of required influenza vaccination or declination procedures for the current influenza season. This communication can be conveyed, but is not limited to, the following methods: email, intranet web postings, meetings, memorandum s, signage throughout the facility, and leadership messaging. 3. Ensure that unvaccinated employees are ma sking for the duration of the influenza season defined by SFDPH at all times in the hospital building, except for break rooms. 4. The rule announced a requirement for SN Fs to report HCP influenza vaccination summary data beginning on October 1, 2022. Beginning with the 2022-2023 influenza season, SNFs must submit data for the entire influenza vaccination season (October 1 through March 31) to NHSN. 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 20203, 2022 C24 Employee Influenza Vaccination Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 3 3.5. HCP influenza vaccination summary data submitted to NHSN by May 15 is reported by CDC to CMS for each SNF CMS Certification Number (CCN). CDC provides an HCP influenza vaccinati on percentage for each reporting SNF CCN. BACKGROUND: Influenza is a serious respiratory disease th at kills approximately 36,000 persons in the United States every year. Ho spitalized patients are particul arly vulnerable to disease exposures. Influenza season is generally consider ed to be October through May for the highest circulation of the virus; however, influenza virus is now considered to be circulating year-round and clinicians should include influenza in any respiratory illness diagnostic consideration regar dless of the season. The in fluenza vaccine reduces the risk of influenza by 40-60% when the vaccine is we ll matched with the circulating strain. The vaccination may not prevent influenza but can lessen the severity and hospitalization once infected. (CDC, 2022) PROCEDURE: 1. Before the start of the influenza season, employees may obtain the influenza vaccine from the LHH Medical Clinic or provide proof of vaccinat ion from another location (e.g. primary care provider) to the clinic. LHH Medical Clinic will make reasonable attempts to ensure influenza vaccination is available to all shifts and on weekends. 2. Employees who have not received the influenza vaccine elsewhere and decline receiving an influenza vaccine at LHH must complete a declination form and abide by mandatory masking impl emented by SFDPH. Employees who have not received their influenza vaccine shall not eat in the cafe teria. An additional break room will be provided during the mandatory masking period for unvaccinated employees. 3. Employees who have not received their influenza vaccine will be asked to physically distance themselves from others during eating and drinking (when universal masking protocols are not in place.) 3.4. Unvaccinated employees who are non-co mpliant with mandatory masking shall receive a verbal warning from their director , supervisor, or manager the first time they are observed without a mask or improperly wearing a mask ... Directors, supervisors, and managers shall report further instances of non-compliance to Human Resources for further disciplinary action. 4.5. Vaccinated employees shall be given a st icker on their ident ification badge. LHH Medical Clinic maintains a list of employee influenza vaccination status. 5.6. Any local, state, or federal public heal th emergency guidance may supersede the above procedures outlined in this policy. 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 20203, 2022 C24 Employee Influenza Vaccination Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 3 ATTACHMENT: None.

Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center (LHH) shall adoptadhere to regulations and recommendations provided by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Centers fo r Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Calif ornia Tuberculosis Controllers Association (CTCA), and San Francisco Department of P ublic Health (SFDPH) TB Prevention and Control Program. Effective September 1, 2021, CDPH is following the latest CDC guidance for tuberculosis (Tuber culosis Control Branch, T uberculosis Guidelines and Regulations.) PURPOSE: 1. Design and implement a pr ogram for screening residents and st aff for latent and active TB infection. 2. Reduce the transmission of TB through pr ompt detection and management of active tuberculosis disease. 3. Comply with federal, st ate, and local regulation. DEFINITIONS: Tuberculosis: According to the CDC, Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis . The bacteria usually attack the lungs, but TB bacteria can attack any part of the body su ch as the kidney, spine, and brain. Not everyone infected with TB bacteria becomes sick with symptoms. As a result, two TB- related conditions exist: latent TB infe ction (LTBI) and TB disease. If not treated properly, TB disease can be fatal. Tuberculosis Disease (T.B.) (formerly known as active T.B): When TB bacteria are active (multiplying in the body), this is ca lled TB disease. People with TB disease are sick and are capable of spreading the bacteri a to others with whom they come into contact. Latent TB infection: The TB bacteria can liv e in the body without causing symptoms. In most cases, those who breathe in the TB bac teria from others, become infected but the body is able to fight the bacteria to stop them from growing and causes TB disease with symptoms. Those with LTBI c annot spread the disease to ot hers but may test positive for T.B. because the bacteria is in their body.

LHH will follow the CDC three- tiredtiered level of hierarchy to control tuberculosis in the facility: a. Administrative b. Environmental c. Respiratory Prot ective Equipment 1.2. Resident Admission, Readmission, and Annual Screening a. Residents with Known or Suspected TB Disease i. Residents who are known or suspected to have TB and are hospitalized or are residents of other healthcare faciliti es, may only be admitted with written approval of SFDPH TB Prevention and Co ntrol Program, or when they are no longer infectious. b. Residents with Docu mented History of Positive Tube rculosis Skin Test (TST) or Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA), or History of Active TB Disease i. No further TST/IGRA required. Do not perform a skin test on someone with known TB. This could cause a severe reaction. ii. TB symptom screen must be performed upon admission: Bloody sputum Hoarseness lasting 3 weeks or more Persistent cough lasting 3 weeks or more Unexplained excessive fatigue Unexplained persistent feve r lasting 3 weeks or more Unexplained excessive night sweats Unexplained weight loss iii. Chest x-ray (CXR) must be performed, unless one was already done in the United States within 90 days prior to admission. iv. Residents shall be screened annually with a CXR and TB symptom screen and if a change in condition suspicious of TB disease occurs. TB screening will include a TB symptom screen and CXR, if indicated. See Pr ocedure 2.b. Room Placement if the CXR result is abnormal. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 202031, 2022 C26 Guidelines for Prevention and Control of Tuberculosis Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 8 c. Residents with Document ed History of Negative TST/IGRA or no Documented History i. Only a single TST is needed if document ation of a previous negative TST is done and recorded within 12 months. T he TST shall be r ead at 48 hours from placement. ii. A single previous negative TST is a cceptable if done and recorded within 90 days of admission. iii.

The California Departm ent of Public Health (CDPH) and the California Tuberculosis Controllers Asso ciation (CTCA) have established guidelines for the civil detention of persi stently non-adherent tuberculosi s patients in California. When the SFDPH Health Officer issues a civ il detention order, the order must describe less restrictive alternatives attempted and only if those alternatives fail, and public safety is put at risk by a pati ent's continued non-adherence (including mental illness, homelessness, and substance abuse) with less restrictive altern atives, may detention be considered appropriate. Detentio n is a very costly intervention and shall only be used when less costly interventions have been unsuccessful. The SFDPH shall initiate civil detention at SFDPH facilities after other less restrictive means to ensure compliance with examinat ion/isolation/quarantin e protocols have been exhausted, and it is determined t hat placement within a SFDPH facility is needed to ensure compliance with support from t he San Francisco Sheriff's D epartment (SFSD) and to avert a health threat to the public. POLICY: 1. The purpose of this policy detent ion is primarily to guide staff during the detention of non- infectious TB patients for the purpose of completing an adequate course of therapy. However, detention may be necessary for certai n patients for the peri od during which they are infectious and where respiratory isolation is possible in some long-term care sites. 1.2.Laguna Honda Hospital (LHH) sha ll admit and provide care to a person who has been placed on a civil detention order for persistently being non-adherent with their tuberculosis (TB) treatment, fa iled to complete their TB treatment when placed in a less restrictive environment, and poses a health threat to the public. 2.3.The decision on the appropriat eness of admitting a patient under a civil detention order shall be made by the Chief Executive Office r (CEO), Chief Medi cal Officer (CMO), Infection Preventionist (IP), and Chief Nursing Officer (CNO ) based on the facility's ability to provide quality care to the patient. The patient may or may not meet skilled nursing facility (SNF) level of care criteria. 3.4.These patients shall be admi tted Monday to Friday excluding holidays secondary to the extra coordination between se rvices that is required, and the limited availability of resources during those times. 4.5.LHH shall utilize the CDPH/CTCA joint guidel ines when appropriate in providing care for the TB patient who is under a civil det ention order.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requires healthcare facilities to perform an Infection Cont rol Risk Assessment (ICRA) before any renovation, construction, or repair projects. 2. The completed ICRA provides for a controlled plan for the removal of building materials or construction project in healthcare facilities that does not place residents at risk for transm ission of pathogens in a vulnerable population. 3. The Infection Control Nurse (ICN) shall be consulted by Facility Services or project manager during preconstruction planning for facility renovation and construction projects. 4. Construction and/or remodeling on the campus will be completed by construction teams that are skilled and trained in the standards for healthcare construction. 5. Construction teams will include the ICN during the planning, pre-construction, construction, and post construction phases at a minimum. 6. The ICN will provide regular surveillance and oversight of the project and the project area to report back to the Infection Control Committee (ICC). PURPOSE: 1. To provide guidance to the healthcare and construction team for containing dust, fungi (including Aspergillus ), chemicals, bacteria (including Legionella ), and other microbial contamination that can be transmitted via the air, plumbing, or from ground disturbance during construction that is required to be minimized during the work phases of construction/renovation projects. a. Soil, water, dust, and decaying organic matter can provide a source of infections when introduced to a vulnerable population that can gain entrance to the facility on construction materials, tools, and the construction workers' clothes and shoes. 2. To engage best practices and healthcare construction standards are integral in the design, demolition, and construction of resident care and other areas that facilitate the desired infection control practices that is guided by completion of the ICRA. 3. To minimize infectious ri sks associated with internal re novation projects in resident care areas, and that the necessary controls and interventions are in place. PROCEDURE: 1. Project Planning File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2020 F1 Renovation / Construction Infection Control Guidelines Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 15 The ICN and Industrial Hygienist shall be advised by the Facility Services department or project manager of plans for renovation and/or new construction. The ICRA shall be a part of integrated facility plannin g, design, construction, and commissioning activities; and shall be conducted during the early planning phase of a project, before construction begins; and continue through project construction and commissioning. Life Safety requirements must also be met. a. A multidisciplinary team that includes the ICN, Industrial Hygienist, Facility Services, and clinical staff shall conduct a proactive ICRA during the design and planning phase for all demolition, renovation, and new construction projects. The scope of the project may require other subject matter experts to be involved. b. After completing the ICRA, precautions shall be taken according to the matrix reflecting the risk level of the resident population and the hazard level of the construction work. A complete field review of infection control implications shall be conducted before any demolition or construction begins. c. Specific areas of consideration but are not limited to: i. Determination of if, where, when, the duration, and how resident care area(s) closures and/or interruptions will occur ii. Mitigation of external air flow in to the facility where there is ground disturbance or demolition of other structures external to the facility that may release air pollution that can enter windows, doors, or other ventilation mechanisms iii. Traffic patterns for residents, staff, and visitors to minimize contamination iv. Resident area risk assessment ;: criteria for emergency work interruptions (stop and start processes) v. Planning for air handling and wate r systems/plumbing as appropriate vi. Education (or whom and by whom) vii. Dust control expectations for subcontractors before start, as needed including workers clothing and shoes when entering the facility viii. Transport and approval for disposal of waste materials d. ICRA expectations shall be incorporated into initial project agreements to ensure contractor accountability. 2.

Renovation areas must be isolated from resident-occupied areas using decreased air flow barriers to eliminate airflow of particles into patient areas. Critical barriers i.e. sheetrock, plywood, or plastic, to seal areas from non-work area shall be completed before beginning any construction work. Porous surfaces, including but not limited to sheetrock shall be painted on the side facing (exposed to) residents with at least one coat of a cleanable/washable no or low volatile organic compound (VOC) paint. b. Temporary construction barriers and closures above ceilings shall be dust tight. A ceiling-to-floor sealed plastic barrier, enclosing the ladder, shall be constructed to contain the dust whenever more than one ceiling tile is to be removed within a resident care area. c. Whenever work is performed in which dust contamination has occurred, the area is to be cleaned as soon as possible using a vacuum cleaner equipped with a High Efficiency Part iculate Air (HEPA) filtration system or damp mopping procedure to prevent the \"tracking\" of dust throughout the facility. Sweeping and dry mopping are never appropriate in a hospital environment. Floor \"tack\" or \"sticky\" mats are to be placed in areas of construction crew egress, and replaced when they lose their ability to capture dust and debris from a user's shoe soles. d. If negative pressure is required (based on ICRA), negative pressure shall be established and continuously maintained to the renovation work area enclosure to contain dust generated by work activities inside the enclosure until all work is complete. e. Negative pressure shall be monitored continuously. Recording manometers shall be used to display and record pressure differentials automatically. Pressure differential records shall be collected and reviewed by project personnel on a daily basis, as evidenced by their initials along with the date and time of the review, and maintained available on site for review by infection control and health and safety personnel upon request. f. Construction waste and demolition debris shall be covered and sealed during transport, and transport equipment cleaned prior to removal from the work area. Transport is to be done during the lowest activity periods. A schedule shall be drafted to inform contractor of times to avoid transport area. Elevators shall be avoided for debris transport. If an elevator is used, it shall be designated for construction use only. Appropriate signage postings are required g. Removal of construction barriers and ceiling protection shall be done outside of normal working hours unless otherwise authorized in advance of activities.

Definition: A Nurse Call System is a method for hospital staff to communicate with residents. Different call stations (i.e., Master Station, Patient Station, Staff Station) allow staff to respond to resident's call, make calls directly to resident's room, and monitor any request s that have been dispatched to staff members. The call system will also alert staff to respond during emer gencies (i.e., Code Blue, staff emergency, or bath calls). Master Station A Nurse Call system monitor that is in each nurse's station and used to: Answer and cancel a routine call from the resident's room. Call a resident's room. Send Requests and/or messages to staff. Assign residents to a group template. Assign a staff member's Wireless Phone to a group (e.g., Licensed Nurse, CNA, HHA, etc. ) A Request that is a pre-set or manually entered will ONLY send a reminder notification (when not addressed) to the sending master station. A ll calls, alerts, and duration of calls are time stamped and recorded in the log bin of the Nurse Call Master Station. This is a touch-screen device with an attached mouse. Pens, markers, or other objects other than fingers should not be used when operating this device. Patient Station When a resident presses the routine call using the pillow speaker, adaptive device or the button on the patient station, tone sounds are emitted with LED illuminations for notifications. The call is also displayed on the nurse call master station. When a call is answered, two-way communication is established between the patient room and nurse master station. Audio is disc onnected when a call is canceled or, put on hold, muted, and when the nurse call master station hangs up the handset. Staff Station For voice communication between the nurse stat ion and non-patient occupied areas such as staff break rooms, conference room, chart room, dining room, solarium, etc. Group Assignment Worksheet This should be completed before performing an y changes in the master station. Group templates of resident assignments and staff Wireless Phone extensions are listed and recorded \\on this worksheet.

The LHH Executive Committee must grant authorization prior to turning off the NurseCall system or before modifying any system settings that may impact resident safety. 2. Group Assignments Works heets must be entered accurately in t he Master Station by charge nurse or designee. If any changes are made in either the resident grouping or wireless phone assignment, the Group Assignment Worksheet must be updated firs t then in the Master Station by the same designated staff. 3. Any changes or updates related to a resident's demographic information that can be seen in the Master Station are done by an authorized sta ff member from Admissi on& Eligibility (A&E). 4. Residents with limited hand mobility, aphasia, and/or hard of hearing will be evaluated by a licensed nurse using adaptive devices guidelines for the co rrect adaptive device. Comp lex situations will be referred to appropriate rehabilit ation staff for evaluation. 5. Unit clerks can answer the r outine calls and forward the call/request to the assigned nursing staff. 6. Nursing staff assigned to a resident will respond to the nurse call system by going to the location of the calling resident. However, routine calls c an also be answered direct ly through the Nurse Call Master Station or via the Wireless phone. All lic ense nurses are not assigned to receive Routine Calls (except PM Acute) . Calls made from any emergency pull cord station (i.e., bathroom/toilet and shower/tub room), bed exit alerts, code blue aler ts, and staff emergency calls must be answered immediately by going to that location. 7. Fire alerts in residents' rooms are trigge red automatedly by the system and are not manually activated by any residents. 8.

The Master Station allows staff to answer the resident 's routine call, view new calls/alerts, monitor the active calls and alerts, make calls directly to resident's room, and monitor requests that have been dispatched to staff member s and schedule/send text messages to the staff. Each neighborhood has their own template for the Group Assignment Worksheet. This is printed out daily by each shift. Charge nurses or de signee changes the worksheet details if t here staffing shortage or a change in the assigned staff or there is a broken Wi reless Phone. Any changes in the Group Assignment Worksheet should be duplicated in the Master Stati on. This Group Assignment Worksheet needs to be kept by charge nurse or designee for three (3) ye ars in case an unusual occurrence may occur. A. Types of Nurse and Resident's Call Stations 1. Master Call Station - comes with a computer wi th the vendor's software, a touch-screen monitor, mouse, keyboard, and connected telephone handset that is used to talk to the resident when answering a routine call. The touch screen has a floor map displaying all resident rooms and beds in the neighborhood. Group and Wireless Phone assign ments are added and edited in the Master Stations. Pens or other sharp objects other than fingers should not be used to operate the master station. 2. Patient's Station - located in each room next to the re sident's bed. All calls activated in patient station, pillow speakers, and other adaptive nurse call devices w ill show in the Master station screen and are routed to the assigned caregiver's Wireless Phone 3. Patient Pillow Speaker -connected to every patient call station. The pillow speaker is also used as remote control and speaker for the television. Group and Wireless Phone assignments are added and edited in the Master Stations. Pens or other shar p objects other than fingers should not be used to operate the master station - DELETE, TH IS IS DUPLICATE AND OUT OF CONTEXT . Pillow speakers or adaptive nurse call devices must be within the resident's reach. 4. Emergency Pull Cord Station -located in every bathroom, toilet, shower or tub room in every neighborhood. 5. Staff Call Stations and Staff Duty Stations - are located in commonly used areas by staff and residents. These include the living rooms at the end of each household, the great rooms and the staff lounge rooms. B. Group Assignment Worksheet See Attachment 3-A for a sample of Group Assignment Worksheet C. Hallway Light Illumination Patterns For each type of call, a corresponding light illuminatio n pattern is displayed on the ceiling light at the end of the hallway (zone light) and outside each resident's door (dome light). These lights will provide visual cues to the staff signaling the location where a call has been made. See Attachment 3-B for list of identified Light Illumi nating patterns and the type of calls it identifies. File: D1 2.1 April 13, 2021 , Revised Nurse and Resident Call System LHH Nursing Policies and Procedures 31. Zone lights - located at the end of each household in the living room area, and in between nurses' stations, and great rooms. The zone light remains lit if there is an active call in the neighborhood. 2. Dome lights -located outside each resident room, above the door. The dome light remains on if there is an active call/alert inside the room PROCEDURES: A. Receiving and Responding to Calls When calls and alerts are activated, it will be sent to both NurseCall Master Station and they are displayed according to their priority ranking , and .also auto paged to the wireless phone. Listed below are the available calls and alerts in order of highest priority. 1. Fire Alert - this highest priority call is always ac tivated by the fire alert system. It is only triggered when there is fire within the resident's room. The alert is displayed in the NurseCall Master Station and will send alerts to all staff Wireless Phon es. It will not trigger if the fire is detected in any other area of the neighborhood (but will tri gger the fire alert system). Smoke Detectors are connected directly to the Patient Stations. 2. Code Blue Call - this highest priority call is intended only for life-threatening medical emergencies. This call overrides any routine call, bed exit alarm, bath call, or staff emergency call. This call must be responded to by any LN and/or nursing staff by going directly to the resident's location where the call was activated. A Code Blue Call can only be initiated at the patient station where medical emergency assistan ce is needed. This call can only be cancelled from the originating patient station after the Code Blue has been cleared by the Code Blue Team. Refer to LHHPP 24-16 (Code Blue). NOTE: There are also code blue in the clinic, rebab and wellness. Please confirm 3. Staff Emergency Call - high priority calls activa ted by pressing the \"STAFF\" button in the patient's station, staff-duty station or NurseCall master call station. This call will override any routine call. Available staff working in the neighborhood shoul d respond and check the resident's status immediately. This call can only be cance lled in the originating patient station. Examples of staff emergency calls, but not limited to: a. Resident found on the floor b. Resident with unsafe behavior needing staff interventions c. Any emergent situation that may requ ire a second nursing staff for assistance 4. Bath Call - a high priority call activated from the pull cord stations located in every resident's bathroom or toilet room, tub room, or tub room in every neighborhood. When activated, a \"Bath\" call appears on the Master Stati on and the wireless phone of assigned staff. Ho wever, due to the hospital building's wiring and sharing of bathroom, the room or bed number that is closest to the bathroom is displayed in the alert message. The assigned staff or any available staff should respond and check the resident's status or conditi on immediately. This call can only be cancelled in the originating toilet station. Each shower pull cord station will state \"Cancel at Toilet\" (station). a. Bath Calls activated from the toilets on the ground and first floors - Pavilion Building go to the nursing office Master Station - MONIQUE: We should move this to additional appendix because as faras I know the bath call from the ground floor also go to rehap master station. And Pav first floor also go to xray and nursing office. Have a separate page may we easier to update/change. Also we need decision from the nursing leader File: D1 2.1 April 13, 2021 , Revised Nurse and Resident Call System LHH Nursing Policies and Procedures 45. Routine Call - regular call initiated from pillow speaker, patient's stati on, or other adaptive nurse call devices. a. For some simple requests, a pre-programmed \"Send Request\" button from the Master Station will send a text message to the assigned staff's Wireless Phone indicating the request, room number and resident's name. Alternatively, a designated staff member answering the call from the Master Station can type a specific request, which is then sent to the assigned staff's Wireless Phone. Once a request is sent to a Wireless Phone, the request must be cleared by pressing the cancel button on the patient station. If the request is not cleared in a pre-determined time, the request will re-appear on the Master Station and will be resent to the Wireless Phone. b. See attachment 3-C for Table of Wait time 6. Cord-out Call - activated when certain device s (i.e. pillow speaker, adaptive nurse call device, bed exit alarmsmart bed , cord and the beds power cord. electric bed ) are accidentally pulled out from the patient station, disengaged from a c onnector, or unplugged from the electric outlet. These calls can only be cancelled from the reside nt's room by reconnecting items that were pulled out, disengaged or unplugged. 7. Bed Exit Alarm -a priority call activated when a re sident is trying to get out from his or her bed. When activated, a message is sent to the assigned Licensed Nurse, CNA, or PCA's Wireless Phone. The assigned staff or any available staff should respond and check the resident's status or condition immediately. This call can only be ca ncelled in the resident's room by resetting the bed alarm. 8. Medevice - an alarm that is sent to the Master Station and Wireless Phone for a portable bed exit if the resident is using a bed that does not have a built-in bed alarm or one that is not compatible with the Nurse Call System. For those bed, a portable bed alarm is used and is manually connected the Nurse Call System. B. Checking Function of Resident Call System 1. Testing the Patient Station: a call initiated fr om the resident's pillow speaker or adaptive device should appear as a routine call in the Master Station as well as on the assigned (CNA or PCA staff's Wireless Phone). The call should be ans werable both at the Master Station and by a Wireless phone, with both parties able to hear ea ch other talking. Both dome light outside of the resident's room and the zone light at t he end of each hallway should turn on. 2. Testing the Bath Call: when the bathroom pull co rd is activated, the call should appear as a bath call in the Master Station as well as the assign ed staff's Wireless Phone with the room number. Both dome light outside of the resident's room and the zone light at the end of each hallway should turn on. a. For the bath calls made from the spa rooms and public toilets within the neighborhood, a designated group of nursing staff are assigned to respond when the pull cord is pulled. The same steps should be followed as stated above when testing pull cords from the spa room and public toilets within the neighborhood. 3. Acknowledged in the Work List in EHR of the assigned Nurse Assistant upon completion of checking: a. Daily for the bedside call lights b. Weekly on bed stripping days for shower and bathroom call lights File: D1 2.1 April 13, 2021 , Revised Nurse and Resident Call System LHH Nursing Policies and Procedures 5 4.
