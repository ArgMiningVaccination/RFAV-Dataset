Vaccines are medicines that help our body's immune system fight illness. By doing this, vaccines have the amazing power to stop us from getting sick! HOW DOES A VACCINE WORK? Vaccines are like a coach \"training\" our immune system to fight an illness. Then, if the illness tries to come into our body, our immune system knows what to do to help make sure that we don't get sick. WHY ARE VACCINES GIVEN AS SHOTS? Our immune system is made up of cells that live in our body and work together to keep us from getting sick. A vaccine shot delivers a picture of the bad virus or bacteria to our immune system. This way, any time the bad virus and bacteria shows up again, our immune system will recognize them and fight to keep us healthy and strong. POWERFUL VACCINES! We have many different vaccines and they help stop diseases going from person to person. This way thousands of people can be saved from suffering from diseases such as measles, polio, tuberculosis and chicken pox and many more!
