After many years of study, I earned my Registered Aromatherapist certification (anticipated renewal 2021). I have training and education in Healing Touch and Energy Medicine. As an Aromatherapy Practitioner, my passion was assisting clients to find their path that would support their body, mind and spirit so that they could be their best whole self. I am so excited to be pursuing my Integrative Health and Wellness Coaching Certification as it is such an important component when achieving one's best self. In 2009, my son joined the Vermont National Guard and deployed to Afghanistan. After losing two of the Soldiers in his Unit, my son struggled for four years and ultimately lost his battle with PTSD and ended his life on September 23, 2014. My passion is working with Veterans to assist them in finding a purpose and a mission in their life. Having a purpose gives individuals hope and the will to live their lives. As I expand my practice, my goal is to support all demographics to find a purpose and guide them on the path that will allow for improved whole health. As a Health Coach, I'm excited to support my future clients as they walk this journey.
