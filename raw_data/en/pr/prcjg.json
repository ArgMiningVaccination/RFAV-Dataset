Her love for music developed at an early age from a need to find peace in a chaotic world. For her, music was always the most effective form of catharsis, and she would play for anyone, anywhere. She placed second on season nine of American Idol, taking her emotive folk rock country style to the masses and catapulting her from coffeehouses to national stages.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.crystalbowersox.com/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Artist Website</a></p> <p>Phillip-Michael Scales had an uncle who played guitar for a living, none other than B.B.
