It is directed to: Investigate complaints alleging that citizens are being deprived of their right to vote by reason of their race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin,or by reason of fraudulent practices; Study and collect information relating to discrimination or a denial of equal protection of the laws under the Constitution because of race, color, religion, sex,age, disability, or national origin, or in the administration of justice; Appraise federal laws and policies with respect to discrimination or denial of equal protection of the laws because of race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, or nationalorigin, or in the administration of justice; Serve as a national clearinghouse for information in respect to discrimination or denial of equal protection of the laws because of race, color, religion, sex, age,disability, or national origin; Submit reports, findings, and recommendations to the President and Congress; Issue public service announcements to discourage discrimination or denial of equal protection of the laws. In furtherance of its fact-finding duties, the Commission may hold hearings and issue subpoenas for the production of documents and the attendance of witnesses. Since the Commission lacks enforcement powers that would enable it to apply specific remedies in individual cases, it refers the many complaints it receives to the appropriatefederal, state, or local government agency, or private organization for action. The Commission is composed of eight part-time Commissioners, four appointed by the President and four by Congress. A full-time Staff Director oversees the day-to-dayactivities of the Commission, headquartered in Washington, DC. The Staff Director isappointed by the President with the concurrence of a majority of the Commission'smembers. The Commission has 51 Advisory Committees\u2014one for each state and the District of Columbia. Each is composed of citizens familiar with local and state civil rights issues.The members serve without compensation and assist the Commission with its fact-finding, investigative, and information-dissemination functions. Each of the Commission's six regional offices coordinates the Commission's operations in its region and assists the State Advisory Committees in their activities.Regional offices are in Washington, DC, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Denver, and LosAngeles. The Commission's Robert S. Rankin Civil Rights Memorial Library is situated in Commission headquarters, 624 Ninth St., NW, Washington, DC 20425. The Commission and its State Advisory Committees have produced hundreds of reports and studies on national, regional, and local civil rights matters. Copies of thesepublications are available free to the public, as is a \"Catalog of Publications,\" by requestto the Publications Office, U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 624 9th Street, NW, Room600, Washington, DC 20425.

EDITOR 'SNOTE Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 3The protection of civil liberties is a nec- essary prerequisite to the protection ofcivil rights: without the freedom to dissent, the possibility of redress rests on themagnanimity of the government ratherthan on the authority of the governed. Civilliberties provide the space in which andthrough which civil rights can be defended,the most important of which is the freedomto discuss and to dissent. The articles and reviews in this issue of the Civil Rights Journal attempt to further the discussion on a number of topics central totoday 's policy debates. Chief among them is the question of civil liberty in a time of war,particularly when one ethnic group is theprimary focus of public concern. In his arti-cle \"Flying While Arab, \" David Harris, a pro- fessor of law at Toledo University, examinesthe evidence regarding the legal and practi-cal case for racial profiling. He finds thepractice not only morally objectionable butlikely to backfire, as the targeted group tac-itly withdraws its full support for the systemthat renders it vulnerable. Few people better represent the possibil- ity of humane discussion than Bob Moses,the civil rights activist who first gainedrenown in the 1960s as leader of the StudentNon-Violent Coordinating Committee. Hischaracteristically modest and wise vision isexhibited in an interview in this issue. Though overshadowed by the terrorist attack on the U.S. in September 2001, votingissues remain a paramount concern formany. Two articles in this issue focus on thattopic. Mark Mauer, the assistant director ofthe Sentencing Project, argues that felonswho have served their time deserve to havetheir right to vote restored. He surveys thelandscape, finding a patchwork of unevenand contradictory state laws, and focuses on the uncomfortable reality that incarcerationrates differ by race, making those who havebeen historically disenfranchised morelikely to suffer the same fate today. Jim Dick-son, by contrast, focuses on the practical dif-ficulties facing people with disabilities, andcalls for laws that provide better access topolling places. In other articles, Frank Wu examines the continuing prejudice faced by Asian Ameri-cans, David Lopes reflects on the history ofthe Kingdom of Kongo, and Gloria Jahodarecounts the events that led to the dispos-session of Native Americans in the \"Trail of Tears. \" The book review section is rich, con- taining full-length reviews of several of themost important works to be published overthe last year or two in sociology, psychol-ogy, and political science. All of these arti-cles have in common a serious engagementwith the issues, a respect for the facts, and areadiness to confront, honestly and fairly,the arguments of opposing points of view.In that sense, they present a model of howto conduct a debate in a democratic polity. If the business of America is business, as Herbert Hoover first said, then one of thebest ways to ensure that all of its peoplehave a chance to participate in the Americandream is by making sure that all of its peoplehave the chance to participate fully in thenation 's economic life. The article, \"Manag- ing the Revolution: Best Practices for 21stCentury Business, \" surveys the field and attempts to bring some of the current aca-demic discussion about prejudice and dis-crimination to bear on life in corporateAmerica. It also attempts to provide clearand specific ideas about how to best managean increasingly diverse population. CR4Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002 Equations An Interviewwith BOBMOSESAn Interviewwith BOB MOSESRadicalLegendary is to Bob Moses what dull is to thud; the adjective has been used so often in proximity to his name itseems to have become a part of it. Moses firstgained national attention in the early 1960s, whenhe was one of the co-founders of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee. He and many ofhis co-workers were beaten and arrested for theiractivities organizing African Americans in the DeepSouth, but no matter how extreme the situation,Moses never lost the calm, stoic demeanor forwhich he became known. For the past 20 years,Moses has turned his attention to a surprising but,he argues, no-less vital project: generating com-munity interest in promoting math literacy. Today,the Algebra Project serves 10,000 students in 28cities nationwide. Moses runs the Project out of itsheadquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, butteaches in Jackson, Mississippi, during the schoolyear. CRJ spoke with Moses in late October 2001. Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 5 Photo: Ron CesarWhat is the Algebra Project? One way to think about it is that it is establishing a \"math literacy floor \" for poor black and Latino students in urban and rural schools. The idea is that the computer age hasushered in a math component, in the way that the indus-trial age brought in a need for reading and writing. Literacybecame necessary for citizenship, for participation in poli-tics. So today the focus is on putting a floor under this tar-get population, so that students have choices, so that it isn 't a question that they can 't access certain domains of knowl- edge. So far, the focus has been on middle schools, on train-ing teachers. We 've had our best successes down South, in states from North Carolina to Louisiana. How did you first get the idea to focus on math? Was it a sort of eureka moment? No, it happened gradually. In my family, I was responsible for our kids ' math education. We have two boys and two girls, and came back to this country from Africa in 1976. Our old-est kid was in M.L. King Open School in Cambridge, and Iwas back in graduate school. When she hit eighth grade, theyweren 't offering algebra. That year I won a McCarthur, so I was working with her, and the teacher said, \"Why don 't you come in and help a couple of more kids? \" So the questionarose, who was taking algebra, and why. We wrote a letter to the parents of every incoming seventh-grade student andasked them what they thought. Universally they said, \"Well my kid should take algebra, but I 'm not sure every kid should. \" On that basis, we offered it to every child. That was the beginning of the Project, with the idea that we would puta floor under every child and develop math literacy \u2014which wasn 't being done at that time. How is the Algebra Project similar to the kind of community organizing you did in the 1960s? In the 1960s, we were using the right to vote as an organ- izing tool. The 1957 Civil Rights Act provided a minimumamount of crawl space that allowed us to organize aroundthe right to vote. When we had been doing direct organ-izing in Mississippi, when we had been doing the freedomrides, we got slapped with long jail sentences and heavyfines, and we couldn 't sustain that. But as long as we were focused on the right to vote, they couldn 't put us in jail and throw away the key. We were using the right to voteas a lever for broad political access. In the Algebra Project,we're using math literacy to achieve the broad goal of eco- nomic and programmatic access, but we 're using it as an organizing tool. Another connection is that the meeting place became a real tool for us. When we think of the civil rights move-ment, we think of eloquent leaders speaking to masses ofpeople in public spaces, but just as important was empow-ering people. The question became, how do we empowerthe people we were working with? and we came up withthis format that allowed them to discuss issues in smallgroups and then go out and see what they could do aboutthose issues. The sharecroppers had a lot of people advocat-ing for them, but it was only once they demanded the rightto vote that it happened. In the Algebra Project, we 're work- ing the demand side of the equation. We 're seeing young people who participated in the Project earlier in their livesbecoming math literacy workers. How many people does the Project reach? We've got programs in New York City, Boston, New Jersey, Baltimore, Chicago, and California. We also have projects inthe South, in Louisiana, Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina,and North Carolina. This year, we 're reaching about 10,000 students, in about 120 schools. How is the Project grown, how is it propagated? Mostly people come to us, as an organization, they make contact, say they want to do this project. Our firstresponse is to see if we can get a local group to sponsorand own it. We 're not trying to run the Project at the grassroots. We want to go where the interest is. But ofcourse we want them [the prospective teachers] to gothrough training and everything. Last summer inArkansas, we had about 80 teachers involved in the train-ing. So now we 're training the trainers. 6Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002WHAT IS STILL RADICAL ABOUT WHAT WE ARE DOING TODAY IS THAT WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO THE BOTTOM , AND ATTEMPTING TO LIFT THE BOTTOM . Have you been measuring the results of the program? Mostly the evaluation is being done by the Program Evalu- ation Group at Leslie College. They 've been looking at us and doing research and evaluations for eight or nine years.Last year, they looked in depth at one San Francisco school.This year, they 're at Lanier High School here in Jackson [Miss.], and they go to the Northeast next year. If you look at the data, they all show the same thing. If you do a certain number of things, the Project can work,and the students come out with higher grades. You 've got to train and support the teachers, which takes two or threeyears for them to get comfortable with the pedagogy. You 've got to get buy-in from the students, you have to get youngpeople involved, and you have to get the community andparents involved in some functional way. Were you inspired at all by the Latin American exam- ple of the \"pedagogy of the oppressed,\" which is basedon the notion that you need to impart not simply a setof skills or base of information, but a sort of criticalpolitical and personal consciousness about society? Actually, that kind of pedagogy we had been developing on our own, in the civil rights movement, particularly in theMississippi theater, where we were really trying to work thedemand side with sharecroppers. We were trying to figureout how to get them to change, to look at struggle as a partof their lives. Somebody like Fannie Lou Hammer comesout of that tradition. How do you answer those who say that what you 're doing now isn 't really radical? Trying to get the right to vote isn 't necessarily radical either; it was getting those people the right to vote that was radical. The political configuration was that they were at the bot-tom. We weren 't content to register middle-class blacks. We were trying to reach those who were really functioningas serfs in our society. And what is still radical about whatwe are doing today is that we are paying attention to thebottom, and attempting to lift the bottom. Because weknow from the 1960s that if you shift the bottom every-thing shifts. Society has to reconfigure itself when you 've got this new mix, these new people at the table. If you 're just looking for a few young people with math talent,that's already been done for quite a while. What 's radical is using algebra as an organizing tool, as a way to gaintraction in the community. It 's not as dangerous as demanding the right to vote, but in terms of building rela-tionships, learning how to struggle, and finding value in aparticular kind of work, the effort is similar. The kids inter-nalize a concept of themselves as knowledge workers,which is the key to becoming productive, and not justthinking of their future in terms of a dead-end job atMcDonald 's. You have some very specific ideas about how to teach algebra. How did they evolve?It's a refinement of what has come down as experiential learning from Dewey, Piaget, Lewin, and other people inprogressive education. I studied under Willard Van OrmanQuine at Harvard, and Quine said that elementary mathand logic get off the ground by the regimentation of ordi-nary discourse, that you take ordinary language andstraightjacket it. So I took this concept into the domain ofexperiential learning, where you have an event, then youhave reflection on the event, conceptualization of theevent, and finally the application. Quine fills in theprocess between reflection and conceptualization. It 's a leap from describing an event in ordinary street languageto describing it in language which focuses on the featuresof the objects as opposed to the objects themselves. Forexample, you focus on the speed or acceleration or trajec-tory of the car, not the car itself. Finally, a couple of big picture questions. As you look back over the past three or four decades, howsatisfied are you with how far things have come? What I 've felt, up to September 11, was that this was a good country to struggle in. You could have a good lifeand struggle. I wasn 't particularly optimistic that in my lifetime you would see these issues of race and class turnedaround, but I had the feeling that you could struggle forthem. Now I think it 's going to be harder in this country, and I 'm not sure yet what 's going to happen. The country itself is tightening up, in response to terror and to thethreat of terror, and that always hits our target populationfirst. So the first thing you see when you come in here atLanier is a recruiting sign, and you see more kids out join-ing the ROTC. I 'm not sure where this is headed. You've always stood in opposition to the main- stream, of course, but also, at least implicitly, tosome of the major civil rights groups and civilrights figures. Where do you believe you are now? We were in opposition to the more mainstream figures on policy issues. If you were working in the grassroots on pol-icy issues, as we were in the Freedom Democratic Party,then inevitably you get into direct conflict with the civilrights organizations that have forged alliances with majorpolicy groups and institutions. Now, today, the issue is theblack middle class, which has taken on the role of manag-ing schools and political institutions that deal with blackpeople as a whole. We bump up against that, because whatwe're doing is a critique of that kind of management. This issue of raising the floor is an issue because it 's their floor. They are the ones managing these institutions that havethese floors. So insofar as they not really willing to developtheir own critiques that what 's going on now isn 't accept- able, you are in various stages of conflict.

Americans have alwaysassumed that terrorism and other violent manifestations ofthe world 's problems did not and would never happen here, that our geographic isolation by the Atlantic and PacificOceans protected us. Indeed, since the Civil War, the UnitedStates has experienced no sustained violence or war on itsown soil. Sadly, we know now that we are vulnerable, andthat like countries all over the world, we must take steps toprotect ourselves. This is the new reality that Americans find themselves adjusting to: searches and inspections of ourselves and ourbelongings when we enter public buildings and areas, suchas government offices, sports stadiums, and airport con-courses; increased presence of law enforcement and evenmilitary personnel; enhanced police powers and curtailedcivil liberties; and new powers and tactics our governmentwill use to deal more strictly with foreigners and immi-grants. While some of these changes amount to little morethan inconveniences, others \u2014particularly changes in the law that limit individual freedom while expanding govern-ment power \u2014are in fact major changes in our way of life and the core values and meaning of American society. TheU.S. Congress has already passed a sweeping piece of legis-lation, increasing government power over everything fromwiretaps, e-mail, formerly secret grand jury information, tothe detention and trial of noncitizens. We know that the United States is a nation of immi- grants \u2014that, in many ways, immigrants built our great nation. We know that the immigrant experience has, in manyways, been at the core of the American experience, along withthe experiences of African Americans liberated from slavery.The diversity and energy that immigrants have brought toour country has been, and continues to be, one of our great-est strengths. But, we also know that we have sometimes dealtharshly and unfairly with immigrants and noncitizen resi-dents, especially in times of national emergency and crisis.Thus, it is critical that we try to understand the implications ofthe changes that have taken place and will continue because of the events of September 11 \u2014changes in the very idea of what America is, and in what it will be in the future. One of these changes has been particularly noticeable \u2014 both because it represents a radical shift in what we did priorto September 11, and because it also continues a public dis-cussion that was taking place in our country before that terri-ble day. Racial profiling \u2014the use of race or ethnic appearance as a factor in deciding who merits police attention as a suspi-cious person \u2014has undergone a sudden and almost complete 8Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002Flying While Arab: LESSONS FROM THE RACIAL PROFILING CONTROVERSY by David Harrisrehabilitation. Prior to September 11, many Americans had recognized racial profiling for what it is \u2014a form of institu- tional discrimination that had gone unquestioned for toolong. Thirteen states had passed anti-profiling bills of one typeor another, and hundreds of police departments around thecountry had begun to collect data on all traffic stops, in orderto facilitate better, unbiased practices. On the federal level,Congressman John Conyers, Jr., of Michigan and Senator Rus-sell Feingold of Wisconsin had introduced the End Racial Pro-filing Act of 2001, a bill aimed at directly confronting andreducing racially biased traffic stops through a comprehensive,management-based, carrot-and-stick approach. September 11 dramatically recast the issue of racial profil- ing. Suddenly, racial profiling was not a discredited law enforcement tactic that alienated and injured citizens while it did little to combat crime and drugs; instead, it became a vitaltool to assure national security, especially in airports. The pub-lic discussion regarding the targets of profiling changed too \u2014 from African Americans, Latinos, and other minorities sus-pected of domestic crime, especially drug crime, to ArabAmericans, Muslims, and others of Middle Eastern origin, wholooked like the suicidal hijackers of September 11. In somerespects, this was not hard to understand. The September 11attacks had caused catastrophic damage and loss of life amonginnocent civilians; people were shocked, stunned, and afraid. And they knew that all of the hijackers were Arab or MiddleEastern men carrying out the deadly threats of Osama binLaden 's al Qaeda terrorist network based in the Middle East, which of course claims Islam as its justification for the attacksand many others around the world. Therefore, many said thatit just makes sense to profile people who looked Arab, Muslim,or Middle Eastern. After all, \"they\" were the ones who 'd car- ried out the attacks and continued to threaten us; ignoringthese facts amounted to some kind of political correctness runamok in a time of great danger. But if the renewed respectability and use of profiling was one of the ways in which September 11 changed things, wemight also notice that the \"new\" racial profiling demonstrated the truth of an old saw: the more things change, the morethey stay the same. We should remember that racial profilingof African Americans and Latinos also originated in a war \u2014 the metaphorical \"war on drugs \"\u2014and was justified with the same arguments. But even more importantly, we should learnfrom what we now know were the grand mistakes of profilingin the last 10 years. If we do that, we will see that using Arabor Muslim background or appearance to profile for potentialterrorists will almost certainly fail \u2014even as it damages our enforcement efforts and our capacity to collect intelligence. History As in almost any serious policy inquiry, a look at the history of our country can help us attain a proper perspective onhow to view what we do now. Unfortunately, that historygives us reasons to feel concern at this critical juncture. Anyserious appraisal of American history during some of the keyperiods of the 20th century would counsel an abundance ofcaution; when we have faced other national security crises,we have sometimes overreacted \u2014or at the very least acted more out of emotion than was wise. In the wake of World War I, the infamous Palmer Raids resulted in the rounding up of a considerable number ofimmigrants. These people were deported, often without somuch as a scintilla of evidence. During World War II, tens ofthousands of Japanese \u2014immigrants and native born, citizens and legal residents \u2014were interned in camps, their property confiscated and sold off at fire-sale prices. To its everlastingshame, the U.S. Supreme Court gave the internment of theJapanese its constitutional blessing in the infamous Korematsu case. It took the United States government decades, but even- tually it apologized and paid reparations to the Japanese. And Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 9 After 9/11, racial profiling was no longer seen as a discredited law enforcement strategy, but as a vital tool to assure national security, especially in airports.Photo: Getty Imagesduring the 1950s, the Red Scare resulted in the ruining of lives and careers and the jailing of citizens, because they had hadthe temerity to exercise their constitutionally protected rightsto free association by becoming members of the CommunistParty years or even decades before. Hopefully, we can see the common thread that runs through these now notorious examples: an apprehension ofdanger to the country not only from the outside but from agroup of people within who are identified racially, ethni-cally, or politically with those thought to pose the threat,and a willingness to take measures that sweep widelythrough the identified group \u2014more widely than the threat might justify. (Of course, we have also learned that thesethreats have been wildly exaggerated; for example, the dis-covery of government documents more than four decadesafter the internment of the Japanese showed that the gov-ernment misled the courts by intentionally withholding crit-ical information that contradicted official efforts to makethe case for a sufficiently severe threat to justify the intern-ment. 1) The threat we face now bears many similarities: a danger from overseas posed by one group, and an identifiedgroup in the United States that has come under suspicion.All of this ought to encourage us not to leap forward with racial or ethnic profiling, but to hesitate before we do. Categorical Thinking We must hope that we have learned the lessons of this his- tory\u2014that the emotions of the moment, when we feel threatened, can cause us to damage our civil liberties andour fellow citizens, particularly our immigrant populations.And it is this legacy that should make us think now, even aswe engage in a long and detailed investigation of the Sep-tember 11 terror attacks. As we listen to accounts of thatinvestigation, reports indicate that the investigation hasbeen strongly focused on Arab Americans and Muslims.What 's more, private citizens have made Middle Eastern appearance an important criterion in deciding how to reactto those who look different around them. Many of thesereports have involved treatment of persons of Middle East-ern descent in airports. In itself, this is not really surprising. We face a situation in which there has been a terrorist attack by a small group of sui- cidal hijackers, and as far as we know, all of those involved were Arabs and Muslims and had Arabic surnames. Some orall had entered the country recently. Given the incrediblyhigh stakes, some Americans have reacted to Middle Eastern-ers as a group, based on their appearance. In a way, this isunderstandable. We seldom have much information on anyof the strangers around us, so we tend to think in broad cat-egories like race and gender. When human beings experiencefear, it is a natural reaction to make judgments concerningour safety based on these broad categories, and to avoid thosewho arouse fear in us. This may translate easily into a type ofracial and ethnic profiling, in which \u2014as has been reported \u2014 passengers on airliners refuse to fly with other passengerswho have a Middle Eastern appearance. Use of Race and Ethnic Appearance in Law Enforcement The far more worrying development, however, is the possi- bility that profiling of Arabs and Muslims will become stand-ard procedure in law enforcement. Again, it is not hard tounderstand the impulse; we want to catch and stop these sui- 10 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002 Constant efforts to stop, question, and search people who \"look like \" suspects, the vast majority of whom are hard-working, tax-paying citizens, will alienate the very ethnic groups whose cooperation we most need to win this fight.Photo: Getty Imagescidal hijackers, every one of whom fits the description of Arab or Muslim. So we stop, question, and search more of thesepeople because we believe it 's a way to play the odds. If all the September 11 terrorists were Middle Easterners, then we getthe biggest bang for the enforcement buck by questioning,searching, and screening as many Middle Easterners as possi-ble. This should, we think, give us the best chance of findingthose who helped the terrorists or those bent on creating fur-ther havoc. But we need to be conscious of some of the things that we have learned over the last few years in the ongoing racial pro-filing controversy. Using race or ethnic appearance as part ofa description of particular suspects may indeed help an inves- tigation; using race or ethnic appearance as a broad predictor of who is involved in crime or terrorism will likely hurt our investigative efforts. All the evidence indicates that profilingArab Americans or Muslims would be an ineffective waste oflaw enforcement resources that would damage our intelli-gence efforts while it compromises basic civil liberties. If wewant to do everything we can to secure our country, we haveto be smart about the steps we take. As we think about the possible profiling of Arabs and Mus- lims, recall the arguments made for years about domesticefforts against drugs and crime. African Americans and Lati-nos are disproportionately involved in drug crime, propo-nents of profiling said; therefore concentrate on them. Manystate and local police agencies, led by the federal DrugEnforcement Administration, did exactly that from the late1980s on. We now know that police departments in manyjurisdictions used racial profiling, especially in efforts to getdrugs and guns off the highways and out of the cities. Forexample, state police in Maryland used a profile on Interstate95 during the 1990s in an effort to apprehend drug couriers.According to data from the state police themselves, whileonly 17 percent of the drivers on the highway were AfricanAmerican, over 70 percent of those stopped and searchedwere black. Statistics from New Jersey, New York, and otherjurisdictions showed similar patterns: the only factor that pre-dicted who police stopped and searched was race or ethnic-ity. 2No other factor \u2014not driving behavior, not the crime rate of an area or neighborhood, and not reported crimes thatinvolved persons of particular racial or ethnic groups \u2014 explained the outcomes that showed great racial or ethnicdisproportionalities among those stopped and searched. But as we look back, what really stands out is how ineffec- tive this profile-based law enforcement was. If proponents ofprofiling were right \u2014that police should concentrate on minorities because criminals were disproportionately minori-ties\u2014focusing on \"those people \" should yield better returns on the investment of law enforcement resources in crimefighting than traditional policing does. In other words, usingprofiles that include racial and ethnic appearance should suc-ceed more often than enforcement based on other, lesssophisticated techniques. In any event, it should not succeedless often than traditional policing. But in fact, in depart-ments that focused on African Americans, Latinos, and otherminorities, the \"hit rates \"\u2014the rates of searches that suc- ceeded in finding contraband like drugs or guns \u2014were actu- ally lower for minorities than were the hit rates for whites, who of course were not apprehended by using a racial or eth-nic profile. That 's right: when police agencies used race or ethnic appearance as a factor \u2014not as the only factor but one factor among many \u2014they did not get the higher returns on their enforcement efforts that they were expecting. Instead,they did not do as well; their use of traditional police meth-ods against whites did a better job than racial profiling, anddid not sweep a high number of innocent people into lawenforcement 's net. The reason that this happened is subtle but important: race and ethnic appearance are very poor predictors of behav-ior. Race and ethnicity describe people well, and there isabsolutely nothing wrong with using skin color or other fea-tures to describe known suspects. But since only a very smallpercentage of African Americans and Latinos participate inthe drug trade, race and ethnic appearance do a bad job iden-tifying the particular African Americans and Latinos in whom police should be interested. Racial and ethnic profiling causedpolice to spread their enforcement activities far too widelyand indiscriminately. The results of this misguided effort havebeen disastrous for law enforcement. This treatment hasalienated African Americans, Latinos, and other minoritiesfrom the police \u2014a critical strategic loss in the fight against crime, since police can only win this fight if they have the fullcooperation and support of those they serve. And it is pre-cisely this lesson we ought to think about now, as the cry goesup to use profiling and intensive searches against people wholook Arab, Middle Eastern, or Muslim. Profiling to Catch Terrorists Using race, ethnic appearance, or religion as a way to decide who to regard as a potential terrorist will almost surely pro-duce the same kinds of results: no effect on terrorist activity;many innocent people treated like suspects; damage to ourenforcement and prevention efforts. Even if the suicide hijackers of September 11 shared a par- ticular ethnic appearance or background, subjecting allMid- dle Easterners to intrusive questioning, stops, or searches willhave a perverse and unexpected effect: it will spread ourenforcement and detection efforts over a huge pool of peoplewho police would not otherwise think worthy of attention.The vast majority of people who look like Mohammed Attaand the other hijackers will never have anything to do withany kind of ethnic or religious extremism. Yet a profile thatincludes race, ethnicity, or religion may well include them,drawing them into the universe of people who law enforce-ment will stop, question, and search. Almost all of them willbe people who would not otherwise have attracted policeattention, because no other aspect of their behavior wouldhave drawn scrutiny. Profiling will thus drain enforcementefforts and resources away from more worthy investigativeefforts and tactics that focus on the close observation of Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 11behavior \u2014like the buying of expensive one-way tickets with cash just a short time before takeoff, as some of the WorldTrade Center hijackers did. This has several important implications. First, just as hap- pened with African Americans and Latinos in the war ondrugs, profiling of Arabs and Muslims will be overinclusive \u2014 it will put many more under police suspicion of terroristactivity than would otherwise be warranted. Almost all ofthese people will be hard-working, tax-paying, law-abidingindividuals. While they might understand one such stop tobe a mere inconvenience that they must put up with for thesake of national security, repetition of these experiences forlarge numbers of people within the same ethnic groups willlead to resentment, alienation, and anger at the authorities. Second, and perhaps more important, focusing on race and ethnicity keeps police attention on a set of surface detailsthat tells us very little and draws officers ' attention away from what is much more important and concrete: behavior. Thetwo most important tools law enforcement agents have inpreventing crime and catching criminals are observation ofbehavior and intelligence. As any experienced police officerknows, what 's important in understanding who 's up to no good is not what people look like, but what they do. Investi-gating people who \"look suspicious \" will often lead officers down the wrong path; the key to success is to observe behav-ior. Anyone who simply looks different may seem strange orsuspicious to the untrained eye; the veteran law enforcementofficer knows that suspicious behavior is what really shouldattract attention and investigation. Thus focusing on thosewho \"look suspicious \" will necessarily take police attention away from those who act suspicious. Even in the current cli-mate, in which we want to do everything possible to preventanother attack and to apprehend those who destroyed theWorld Trade Center and damaged the Pentagon, law enforce-ment resources are not infinite. We Americans must makedecisions on how we run our criminal investigation and pre-vention efforts that move us away from doing just anything , and toward doing what is most effective . Third, if observation of suspicious behavior is one of law enforcement 's two important tools, using profiles of Arabs, Muslims, and other Middle Easterners can damage our capac-ity to make use of the other tool: the gathering, analysis, anduse of intelligence. There is nothing exotic about intelligence; it simply means information that can be useful in crime fight- ing. If we are concerned about terrorists of Middle Eastern ori-gin, among the most fertile places from which to gather intel-ligence will be the Arab American and Muslim communities.If we adopt a security policy that stigmatizes every member ofthese groups in airports and other public places with intrusivestops, questioning, and searches, we will alienate them fromthe enforcement efforts at precisely the time we need themmost. And the larger the population we subject to this treat-ment, the greater the total amount of damage we inflict onlaw-abiding persons. And of course the profiling of Arabs and Muslims assumes that we need worry about only one type of terrorist. We mustnot forget that, prior to the attacks on September 11, themost deadly terrorist attack on American soil was carried outnot by Middle Easterners with Arabic names and accents, butby two very average American white men: Timothy McVeigh,a U.S. Army veteran from upstate New York, and TerryNichols, a farmer from Michigan. Yet we were smart enoughin the wake of McVeigh and Nichols ' crime not to call for a profile emphasizing the fact that the perpetrators were whitemales. The unhappy truth is that we just don 't know what the next group of terrorists might look like. 12 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002 Using Arab or Muslim background or appearance to profile for potential terrorists will almost certainly fail \u2014even as it damages enforcement efforts and our capacity to collect intelligence.Photo: Getty ImagesRace or Ethnicity As Just One Factor Among Many? In many discussions of profiling, the question some raise is not whether to use race or ethnic appearance, but how. Pro- ponents and defenders of racial and ethnic profiling haveargued that profiling would be both acceptable and effectiveif race or ethnic appearance was not the only factor that indi- cated suspicion, but just one factor among many . The idea is that race and ethnic appearance should never be the only fac-tors that prompt suspicion, but could be useful if they are partof the whole picture that also includes behavior. Are there, infact, conditions under which it might make sense to treatpeople differently according to their race or ethnic appear-ance, as long as it is just one factor among many? Our prior experience with profiling counsels against this approach. Despite what many believe, racial profiling hasalmost never involved situations in which police used race asthe only factor in deciding which drivers or pedestrians tostop. In fact, it would be surprising if this were ever true.Human motivation is far too complex in any given situationto be based on one fact; moreover, even the thickest, mostbigoted member of a police organization would know betterthan to simply stop people based on race. And the numbersof drivers and pedestrians in the world would make thisimpossible anyway; as Justice Robert Jackson said many yearsago, when he was the attorney general of the U.S., traffic lawsand violators of those laws are so numerous that police mustinevitably choose between violators when deciding againstwhom to enforce the law. But even if race or ethnicity is just one factor among oth- ers, it still presents dangers. Using race or ethnicity for pur-poses other than describing a particular suspect or suspectsmeans that we must accept that race or ethnicity can becomethe dominant or most important factor among all of the oth-ers. And since people remain likely to attribute suspicion tothose different from themselves in the broad categorical waysdiscussed earlier, we end up with race or ethnicity not just asan additional, sharpening factor as we focus suspicion, but as the factor that for all practical purposes directs our actions as we decide who to stop, question, and search. This, of course,brings us back to the pillars of traditional policing: race orethnic appearance may be a valuable descriptor, but it is notbehavior. It tells us nothing about what people do or havedone, and instead distracts us from observing behavior. Second, we cannot discount the obvious skill and determi- nation of the adversaries we face in this struggle. The Septem-ber 11 attacks made clear that the al Qaeda terrorists were notwild, unguided fanatics. Rather they showed a high degree ofintelligence and cunning, spotting and taking advantage ofunnoticed weaknesses in our immigration and aviation secu-rity systems. They showed the ability and the patience forlong-range planning and careful action, as well as strict self-discipline. All of this is, of course, in addition to a belief intheir own cause so strong that they were willing to sacrificetheir own lives to attain their goals. And we cannot forgetthat the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11was not the first, but the second attempt to destroy those buildings; their first attempt, in 1993, was unsuccessful, andthey watched, waited, and planned for eight years to try again.With enemies of such craftiness and determination, it seemsextremely unlikely that they will use people for their nextattack who look like exactly what we are looking for. Rather,they will shift to light-skinned people who look less like Arabsor Middle Easterners, without Arabic names, or to people whoare not Middle Easterners at all, such as individuals fromAfrican nations or the Philippines. (In both places, there aresignificant numbers of Muslims, a small but significant num-ber of whom have been radicalized.) This, of course, will putus back where we started, and racial or ethnic appearance willbecome a longest-of-long-shot, almost certainly an ineffectivepredictor at best, and a damaging distracting factor at worst. Conclusion The terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, DC, present us with many difficult choices that will test us. Wewill have to ask ourselves deep questions: Who are we, as anation? What is important to us? What values lay at thecore of our Constitution and our democracy? How will wefind effective ways to secure ourselves without giving upwhat is best about our country? The proper balancebetween safety and civil rights will sometimes be difficult tosee. But we should not simply repeat the mistakes of thepast as we take on this new challenge. Only our adversarieswould gain from that. DAVIDHARRIS IS BALK PROFESSOR OF LAW AND VALUES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO COLLEGE OF LAW AND SOROS SENIOR JUSTICE FELLOW .

Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 13CRFor Asian Americans, the questions frequently come paired like that. Among ourselves, we can even joke nervously about how they justabout define the Asian American experience. More than anything elsethat unifies us, everyone with an Asian face who lives in America is afflicted by the perpetual foreigner syndrome. We are figuratively and even lit-erally returned to Asia and ejected from America. Often the inquisitor reacts as if I am being silly if I reply, \"I was born in Cleve- land, and I grew up in Detroit, \" or bored by a detailed chronology of my many moves around the country: \"Years ago, I went to college in Baltimore; I used to practice law in San Francisco; and now I live in Washington, DC. \" Sometimes she reacts as if I am obstreperous if I return the question, \"And where are you really from? \" People whose own American identity is assured are perplexed when they are snubbed in this manner. They deserve to know why \"where are you really from? \" is so upsetting. My white friends of whom I have asked the question are amused at best and befuddled at worst, even if one of their grandparents wasan immigrant or all of them once were. They deserve to know why \"where are you really from? \" is so upsetting to Asian Americans even if it carries no offen- sive connotations to them. 14 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002 Where are you REALLYfrom?Asian Americansand the PerpetualForeigner Syndrome by Frank H. Wu \"Where are you from?\" is a question I like answering. \"Where are you really from?\" is a question I really hate answering. \"Where are you from?\" is a question we all routinely ask one another upon meeting a new person. \"Where are you really from?\" is a question some of us tend to ask others of us very selectively.Like many other people of color (or a few whites who have marked accents) who share memories of such encounters, Iknow what the question \"where are you really from? \" means, even if the person asking it is oblivious and regardless ofwhether they are aggressive about it. Once again, I have beenmistaken for a foreigner or told I cannot be a real American. The other questions that follow in the sequence make the subtext less subtle. Assuming that I must be \"really from \" someplace else and not here, even pausing for the prelimi-nary \"where are you really from? \" some people proceed to ask me: \"How long have you been in our country? \" \"Do you like it in our country? \" \"When are you going back? \" and \"Do you have the chance to go home often? \" I am asked these questions with decreasing frequency over time but still toooften, and I am surprised at the contexts in which they con-tinue to pop up. When I give a speech, every now and then a nice person will wait to chat with me and with utter sincerity and no hintof irony, start off by saying, \"My, you speak English so well. \" I am tempted to reply, \"Why, thank you; so do you. \" I don 't suppose that such a response would make my point to anybody but myself. I am disappointed by these tire-some episodes because strangers have zeroed in on my raceand seem to be aware of nothing else. Taken together, theirquestions are nothing more than a roundabout means of ask-ing what they know could not be directly said, \"What race are you? \" Their comments imply that I am not one of \"us\" but one of \"them. \" I do not belong as an equal. My heart must be somewhere else rather than here. I am a visitor atbest, an intruder at worst. I must know my place, and it is nothere. But I cannot even protest, because my complaintexposes me as an ingrate. I don 't appreciate the opportunities I have been given. People who know nothing about me havean expectation of ethnicity, as if I will give up my life story asan example of exotica. A few people, I suspect, ask where we are from out of a naivet \u00e9 blended with malice. If pressed about my origins, I answer that my parents came from China, lived in Taiwan,and then came here as graduate students in the 1950s. Myinterlocutors sometimes say, \"Oh, I thought so, \" and end the exchange. They have placed me in their geography of raceand somehow they know all they need to know. They mustfeel that they have gleaned an insight into me by knowingwhere I am \"really \" from and they can fit me into their racial world order. What makes the incidents comical is that the person wait- ing in line, the clerk behind the counter, the stranger on thestreet, and whoever else turns around, leans over, or pulls measide to ask \"where are you really from? \" does so as if they are asking me something I have not been asked before. They donot know that they are reenacting a hackneyed scenario. Other people, I suppose, ask Asian Americans where they are really from because they sincerely would like to knowabout China or Asia, or they would like to show off whatthey already know. They are compelled to tell me that theywent to China for a vacation last year and saw the Great Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 15 \u00a9 Najlah Feanny/CORBIS SABAWall or they ate at a Chinese restaurant where they espe- cially liked the food. They may want to ask if it is really true,what they say about Asians, or there may be a phrase they 'd like translated. Asians and Asian Americans occasionally ask me the same question, but possibly with different meaning. Some of themare the same as anyone else: they may want to confirm aconjecture of some sort, or they wish to confide that theydetest another group, say, Koreans or Vietnamese. A fewwould like to establish rapport with someone else who hap-pens to be a minority and an outsider. They might need helpbecause of their poor English or finding their way in an unfa-miliar country, and they guess that I will be sympathetictoward them if not similar to them. What makes these incidents disquieting is that the pas- senger at the airport, the waiter at the restaurant, the doctor,any Asian individual who turns around, leans over, or pullsme aside to ask, \"Where are your people from? \" \"Where are your parents from? \" or \"What province is your family from? \" does so as if they are asking me what has not been askedthem before. They do not care that they are reinforcing prej-udices that affect them. In the diverse democracy that makes up today 's United States, we have decided that we will not be bound by our col-lective past. Yet we remain acutely aware of race \u2014which is not to say that we are racists. We want to know about race,but for many different reasons. The question \"where are you really from? \" shows that we interact with others around us with a sense of race even ifwe are not mindful of it. Being asked \"where are you really from? \" likely will not result in my being denied an apart- ment or a job, except in isolated instances. I wonder whatpeople are thinking, though: when I was interviewing for aposition as a law professor only seven years ago, I was toldby a senior faculty member at one school (in California noless), \"How appropriate that we have the Asian candidate today \"\u2014he was referring to December 7, Pearl Harbor Day. I believe the question is a signal, along a spectrum of invid-ious color-consciousness that starts with speculation butleads to worse. To be met with it so quickly and so oftenreminds me, over and over, that I am being treated differ-ently than I would be if I were white. Yet some people who want to talk to me about where I am from want to share with me where they are from liter-ally or where they are coming from, so to speak. For that rare individual, asking \"where are you really from? \" is intended as an invitation to a dialogue about what it meansthat each of us has come here from elsewhere and where wecan go together. The late Isaiah Berlin, a great philosopherof pluralism, once wrote, \"Only barbarians are not curious about where they come from. \" But he included that subject of self-inquiry in a lengthy list of topics in \"the pursuit of the ideal. \" He thought that the civilized person ought to care about, as importantly, \"how they came to be where they are, where they appear to be going, whether they wishto go there, and if so, why, and if not, why not. \" Whether \"where are you really from? \" begins or ends the conversation is crucial, then. The answer depends on whythe question is asked. Unfortunately, there is worse. Whenever I have had the privilege of appearing in a public forum discussing a con-troversial topic \u2014and any issue worth discussing in a public forum is likely to be a controversial topic \u2014I receive letters, phone calls, and e-mails from people who disagree vehe-mently with my perspective. I enjoy the 15 minutes offame, but I am taken aback by a few of the messages. They run along the lines of, \"Yeah, and what do they do in China? \" I have been told, for example, that because it would not be easyfor a white person to become a Chi-nese citizen, it is obvious that allcountries value their sovereignty.Thus, according to this reasoning,the United States is no different inmaking it hard for a Chinese personto become an American citizen. When I have spoken up in favor of affirmative action for historically underrepresentedminority groups that continue to face racial disparities, Ireceived hate mail that asked questions such as whetherthey have affirmative action in Japan. I am tempted to retort, \"How would I know? \" Or with too much cleverness for my own good, I could come backwith, \"What does that have to do with the price of tea in China? \" The put down of opinions held by Asian Americans through an allusion to their presumed homeland is an adhominem attack in its classic form. It has nothing to dowith the substance of an argument and everything to dowith the identity of the person advancing it. The writer whoasked me about Japan had it wrong, doubly. I am ChineseAmerican, not Japanese American. But even though myparents came from China, I have never even set foot on theAsian continent. I have heard the point as a direct taunt. It comes as the heckler 's jeer: \"If you don 't like it here, then go back where you came from. \" Or it comes as the snubbed host 's uncom- prehending whine: \"Don't you like everything this country has given you? \" 16 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002It is a swift slide from an overseas group to an American individual by wayof the catch-all phrase \"you people, \" as in, \"if you people hadn 't bombed Pearl Harbor ....\"The perpetual foreigner syndrome also can be expressed as empathy. Now and again, people introduce themselves to meby speaking pidgin Chinese. Or they make an elaborate showof bowing that is so inept that it might as well be a parody.They don 't realize that I speak English perfectly well and am accustomed to shaking hands. I have listened to people explain to me, trying their patience as much as mine, that they appreciate how I as anAsian American may face discrimination here, becausewhen they as Americans were traveling as tourists in Chinaor Japan they, too, felt prejudice. As much as I value effortsat mutual understanding, even these kindly people areoffering up an analogy that is frustratingly inappropriate. Itshows both what is wrong with the way Asian Americansare characterized and the nuance of the error. As a law professor, I help train people to argue from anal- ogy and to distinguish among different cases. Some analo-gies are persuasive; other analogies are inapt. The propercomparison to the treatment of a white American over-seas\u2014where he is in fact a \"foreigner \"\u2014is the treatment of a nonwhite American overseas \u2014where in fact he is a \"for- eigner. \" If the idea is to match up the situations, then the appropriate counterpart to the treatment of a white Ameri-can in Asia is the treatment of an Asian American in Europe.Otherwise, the necessary implication is that America is awhite nation. Incidentally, a nonwhite United States citizenvisiting \"the Continent \" is likely to be regarded as a bona fide Yankee. I am as able as my neighbor to be an uglyAmerican: a loud, rude, English-speaking tourist expectingto be catered to. When I am outside the United States, it is readily apparent to the rest of the civilized world where Icome from as soon as I open my mouth. Here at home, many Asian Americans are familiar with those awful moments when, in a dispute over who was inline first at the cash register, where dogs can be walked, whobumped into whom, or in declining to give money to apanhandler, and so forth, a person who is white or blacksuddenly shouts something about \"go back to where you came from \" or mutters an aside meant to be overheard about \"all these damn foreigners. \" In these instances, Asian Americans must decide whether they can and should disre-gard the racial tone. I find that when I respond, even if I tryto reason with someone, they sometimes become implaca-ble and the effort to engage them is futile. They insist morehotly that they are right, not racist. They were merely claim-ing the parking space they saw first, and even if they said,\"You know, this is the way we do it in America \" or asked, \"How long have you been in this country, anyway? \" it was- n't a veiled racial reference and I shouldn 't take it as such. Most people don 't see the slippery slope leading from governments and companies to nations and peoples andthen to races and cultures; it is a swift slide from an overseasgroup to an American individual by way of the catch-allphrase \"you people, \" as in, \"if you people hadn 't bombed Pearl Harbor . . . \" The distinction of United States citizen- ship, seemingly all-important, is blurred away. It is as easynow as it was a century ago to find diatribes about the Chi-nese government or Japanese companies that speak in Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 17Chinese American girl scouts in Seattle, Washington, 1947. \u00a9 Seattle Post-Intelligencer Collection; Museum of History & Industry/CORBISterms of China or Japan as monoliths or that conclude \"the Chinese are a military threat \" or \"the Japanese are an eco- nomic threat. \" The further proclamations that \"the Chinese are belligerent \" or \"the Japanese are devious \" don't have a clear stopping point. During the peak of Japanese economic gains, when in 1989, the Mitsubishi conglomerate bought Rockefeller Cen-ter, politicians and pundits took it as a dire sign that thesoul of America was for sale. In 1992, opponents almostblocked the sale of the Seattle Mariners baseball team to thefounder of Japanese game-maker Nintendo, who wanted tosave the franchise for the city and forestall its move to alarger market. In contrast to the fallout from Japan-bashing,there were no such concerns about the British and Dutchcompanies that owned more U.S. properties than the Japan-ese even during the latter 's buying frenzy, nor in 1998 when the German Daimler conglomerate, makers of Mercedes- Benz, merged with Chrysler, effectively taking it over. (Showing the pointlessness of asking about the nationalityof international conglomerates, Daimler and Chrysler bothowned part of Mitsubishi.) The original points that critics make about the handful of totalitarian leaders of the Chinese Communist Party or afew top business executives in a Japanese industry may bewell founded and even persuasive, but they are generalizedbeyond all reason. Whether by intention or through care-lessness, an anti-Asian outlook appears to encompass Asianimmigrants and even Asian Americans. Those who exclaim,\"But we don 't mean Chinese Americans or Japanese Amer- icans, \" should realize that others do, and it is as difficult for people to distinguish between the two positions as it is easyto clarify what is meant. Such precision would weaken therhetoric: it is more emphatic to exclaim \"the Chinese \" and \"the Japanese \" than to talk about the Chinese government or Japanese companies, but it also is dangerous and wrong. The confusion of Asians and Asian Americans springs from rules that would prohibit Asians from ever becomingAsian Americans. The racial conception of citizenship they reinforced has a long lineage. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act. Over time, the legislation was extended to create an Asiatic-barred zone. Asian immigrants were not allowed, with onlya few exceptions \u2014many came illegally, masquerading as the \"paper sons \" of individuals who were already legally present; they were \"sons\" only on paper and not in reality. Asian residents were prevented from becoming naturalizedcitizens, because they could not meet the prerequisite ofbeing a \"free white person. \" University of California at Davis law professor Bill Ong Hing has said of these immi-gration policies: \"It's no accident that the Statue of Liberty faces Europe and has her back to Asia and Latin America. \" Such sentiments were not limited to Asians; but they were undeniably racial, ethnic, and religious in all theirmanifestations. The nativist movement sought to restrictthe number of Europeans who were Southern and Eastern,and Catholic and Jewish. They brazenly wished to preservethe white Anglo-Saxon Protestant dominance of the coun-try, setting their quotas for visas based on the percentages ofeach ethnic group 's representation in the country at the turn of the century and assuming that anyone who was notpart of their \"old stock \" was inferior. The federal government opposed citizenship even for native-born individuals of Asian ancestry. In a test case in1895, the solicitor general \u2014the government 's lawyer before the Supreme Court \u2014opposed the application of Wong Kim Ark for citizenship. Wong had been born in San Francisco toparents who were Chinese. His hopes sprang from the 14thAmendment to the Constitution, which overturned the Dred Scott decision depriving African Americans of citizen- ship, and which continues to guarantee everyone \"equal protection \" under the law. The 14th Amendment opens, \"All persons born . . . in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States . . . \" In his brief to the Supreme Court, the solicitor general presented the official view of the government by reviewingthe precedent that appeared to support Wong before invok-ing the sacredness of citizenship. He states, \"For the most persuasive reasons we have refused citizenship to Chinesesubjects . . . and yet, as to their offspring, who are just asobnoxious, and to whom the same reasons for exclusionapply for equal force, we are told that we must accept themas fellow-citizens, and that, too, because of the mere acci-dent of birth. \" He asks rhetorically whether \"Chinese chil- dren born in this country \" should \"share with the descen- dants of the patriots of the American Revolution the exaltedqualification of being eligible to the Presidency of thenation. \" His answer is adamant: \"If so, then verily there has been a most degenerate departure from the patriotic idealsof our forefathers; and surely in that case American citizen-ship is not worth having. \" Nonetheless, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Wong by a 6-to-3 vote. It wrote that the citizenship conferred bythe measure was \"general, not to say universal, restricted 18 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002A young girl with the family baggage, awaiting deportation to an internment camp, 1942. \u00a9 CORBISonly by place and jurisdiction, and not by color or race. \"1 Even the Supreme Court was not as willing to allow Asian immigrants to naturalize. It gave itself the power toassign racial identities and the consequences that followed.From the inception of federal regulation over immigration,Congress had maintained the rule that only \"free white per- sons\" could naturalize. In 1870, it amended the statute to allow \"persons of African nativity, or African descent \" to naturalize as well. Thus, Asian immigrants had to pleadeither that they were \"free white persons \" or \"persons of African nativity, or African descent. \" In dozens of cases, they lost repeatedly. Takao Ozawa, a Japanese immigrant, and Bhagat Singh Thind, an Indian immigrant, both had their cases heard bythe Supreme Court; both of them lost, within three monthsof each other in 1922 -23. 2As University of California at Berkeley law professor Ian F. Haney Lopez detailed in anexcellent academic study, Ozawa wrote an autobiographicalbrief before retaining a former U.S. attorney general to arguehis case. Ozawa attests to his assimilation: \"In name, Gen- eral Benedict Arnold was an American, but at heart he wasa traitor. In name, I am not anAmerican, but at heart I am anAmerican. \" Called a paragon of assimilation by later scholars,Ozawa reviews his own life: hisflouting of Japanese laws requir-ing that he report himself, hismarriage, and his children 's birth to the government; hislack of affiliation with Japaneseorganizations; his children 's attending an American church and an American school; hisuse of English, and his children 's lack of knowledge of Japanese; his education at American schools; his continu-ous residence for 28 years; his preference for an American-educated wife; and his readiness to \"return the kindness which our Uncle Sam has extended me. \" Moreover, Ozawa argued he was literally white, even more so than \"the aver- age Italian, Spaniard or Portuguese. \" The Supreme Court rejected his claims without much difficulty. It reasoned that \"white \" and \"Caucasian \" were synonymous. Japanese were not white, because they werenot Caucasian. Their skin color was inconsequential,because skin color was not the only test of racial identity. Thind tried a different tactic, to no avail. Exactly as the precedent set by Ozawa suggested would be appropriate, hereferred to the many taxonomies of race that had beendevised by social scientists. Within the leading schemes,Asian Indians were not only Caucasian but also Aryan. The Supreme Court should have been caught by its own equation of \"white \" and \"Caucasian, \" but it disposed of Thind 's petition with the same alacrity it had shown Ozawa. It backed away from the scientific test, reasoning\"the words 'free white person ' are words of common speech, to be interpreted in accordance with the under-standing of the common man. \" By that standard, \"the physical group characteristics of the Hindus renders themreadily distinguishable from the various groups of personscommonly recognized as white. \" The law was more than matched by popular literature and even progressive political movements. Novelist Jack London, whose dispatches from Asia for the Hearst newspapers that introduced the term \"yellow peril, \" also wrote an essay of that title in 1904 warning of the \"menace \" to the Western world from \"millions of yel- low men \" (Chinese) under the management of \"the little brown man \" (Japanese). His rejoinder to fellow socialists who admonished him for these attitudes toward Asians was\"What the Devil! I am first of all a white man and only then a Socialist. \" His belief in Anglo-Saxon supremacy was fervent and formed \"a dominant note throughout all his writing, \" according to his daughter, as was his conviction that \"the world has ever belonged to the pure breed, and has never belonged to the mongrel, \" in his own words. Labor organizer Samuel Gompers, president of the AFL- CIO, co-wrote a pamphlet in 1901 about \"Meat versus Rice: American Manhood Against Asiatic Coolieism \u2014Which Shall Survive, \" arguing \"while there is hardly a single reason for the admission of Asiatics, there are hundreds of goodand strong reasons for their absolute exclusion. \" On other occasions, he warned of \"the menace of a possible over- whelming of our people by hordes of Asiatics. \" He explained that \"the Caucasians . . . are not going to let their standard of living be destroyed by negroes, Chinamen, Japs,or any others. \" Despite the AFL having pledged to unite working people \"irrespective of creed, color, sex, nationality, or politics, \" Gompers forbade locals from accepting Chi- nese or Japanese members. Gompers was not like other anti-Asian agitators, however, who were anti-Asian through and through without any reser-vations. He wanted to be known as open-minded. He insistedthat he had no grudge against Asian immigrants, but was act-ing as he did because of his experiences and observations. Hesaid in his autobiography, \"It is my desire to state emphati- cally that I have no prejudice against the Chinese people \" but only \"profound respect for the Chinese nation. \" He said in the very next paragraph, \"I have always opposed Chinese immigration not only because of the effect of Chinese stand-ards of life and work but because of the racial problem createdwhen Chinese and white workers were brought into the close Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 19People who know nothing about me have an expectation of ethnicity, as if I will give up my lifestory as an example of exotica.contact of living and working side by side. \" These contradic- tory comments were not exceptional. He had said earlier thatonce the Chinaman comes, he has either dominated or beendriven out, for \"the Chinaman is a cheap man. \" He then added, as if he had regrets for his hatred, \"The American peo- ple do not object to the Chinese because they are Chinese, \" but because of all the ills they would bring to the country. It never occurred to Gompers that Asian immigrants were not inherently any different from other laborers, butwere sometimes forced into being scabs. He did not thinkthat he could organize them to strengthen all workers, andhe did not recognize that he was contributing to the veryracial problem he blamed for the inability to join forces. Forhim, race was crucial and exclusion was preferable to coop-eration. Yet he recognized, however dimly, that it would bewrong to act out of prejudice even if he refused to acknowl-edge his own feelings as prejudice. Demagogues Madison Grant and Lothrop Stoddard had expressed the same apprehensions in their best-sellers in1916 and 1920, respectively. Grant wrote The Passing of a Great Race ; Stoddard, The Rising Tide of Color . In both, the two now-forgotten social Darwinists posited an imminentracial conflict arraying black, brown, and yellow against the superior white. More extreme than Oswald Spengler, the historian who devised the idea of the decline of the West,Grant and Stoddard were especially worried about \"race sui- cide\" by the internal weakening of the stock of the Nordic or the Anglo-Saxon. Chair of the New York Zoological Society, Grant argues on a biological basis for global segregation of barbaric fromcivilized races. With his interest in museums and environ-mentalism \u2014he formed a society to save the redwood forests \u2014Grant represented the blend of privilege and preju- dice, with culture and science, that shaped public policy. Although he had a moneyed pedigree that dated back to the Colonial age, Grant was a self-proclaimed Democrat. Heaverred that wealthy classes had introduced both blackslaves and Asian immigrants, to the detriment of commonpeople. But he did not indict the wealthy for seeking theirown advantage, and instead expressed hostility toward thepeople who were exploited. \"If there had been an aristo- cratic form of governmental control in California, \" he said, \"Chinese coolies and Japanese laborers would now form the controlling element, so far as numbers are concerned, onthe Pacific coast. \" In other words, it was the Asian workers who were the enemy. A magazine editor and radio broadcaster who authored more than a dozen books, including a history of children,Stoddard was a disciple of Grant 's. Several of his works advo-cated nativism and eugenics. Before World War II, he reported from Germany as an enthusiast of Hitler 's regime. He posits an \"iron law of inequality. \" Stoddard states that the \"obviously dangerous Oriental \" was someone \"against whose standards of living the white man cannot compete. \" He views \"the brown and yellow worlds of Asia \" as \"the effective centres of colored unrest. \" He worries that Asians would endanger whites because theyhad their own \"admirable cultures rooted in remote antiq- uity and worthy of all respect, \" but they also \"are to-day once more displaying their innate capacity by not merelyadopting, but adapting, white ideas and methods. \" He dis- claims any \"disparagement of the Asiatic. \" He argues that both Asians and whites were justified in winning opportu-nities in new lands, but \"the hard facts are that there is not enough for both \" and the Asian \"automatically crushes the white man out. \" Grant and Stoddard were influential, before their ideas of white superiority were repudiated in the aftershock of thehorrors of Nazi death camps. Stoddard is even fictionalizedin F. Scott Fitzgerald 's classic chronicle of the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby . The character Tom Buchanan, who has been reading Stoddard (called Goddard), proclaims, \"The idea is if we don 't look out the white race will be \u2014will be utterly submerged . . . Well, these books are all scientific. \" During military crisis, the perpetual foreigner syndrome becomes especially dominant. After Imperial Japanlaunched its sneak attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7,1941 \u2014\"a day that will live in infamy \" in President Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's historic Declaration of War speech \u2014 approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans were suspectedof the worst treason. They were presumed guilty as a groupof collaboration, sabotage, espionage, and being a likely\"fifth column \" in the event of an invasion. While two- thirds of the population consisted of native-born UnitedStates citizens, they were thought to have blood ties to ahostile power in what was viewed as a racial war. Given a few days ' notice, they were rounded up and sent to 10 hastily erected internment camps in deserts andswamps. With few exceptions, they were never chargedwith any crimes or convicted of any wrongdoing. They losttheir liberty, their livelihoods, their communities, and theirpossessions. The panic after Pearl Harbor was understandable. The dis- aster was unprecedented. Yet the decision to blame JapaneseAmericans should be neither condoned nor followed. Lieutenant General John DeWitt, commander of the West- ern Defense, famously declared, \"A Jap 's a Jap . . . is an enemy race . . . It makes no difference whether 20 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002During military crises, the perpetual foreigner syndrome becomes especially dominant.he is an American citizen, he is still a Japanese. \" He added that German Americans and Italian Americans were onlydangerous in some instances, \"but we must worry about the Japanese all the time until he is wiped off the map. \" Justice Hugo Black, renowned as a civil libertarian, wrote the majority opinion in the best known of the four SupremeCourt cases lending judicial approval to the wholesale incar-ceration of a minority group. 3Justice Black reasoned that Fred Korematsu, who had had crude plastic surgery in anattempt to pass as Hispanic and stay with his white girl-friend instead of reporting to an internment camp, \"was not excluded from the Military Area because of hostility tohim or his race. \" Instead, Black expounds, \"He was excluded because we are at war with the Japanese Empire. \" Justice Black notwithstanding, the crux of the matter must have been race. For aside from being of Japaneseancestry, Korematsu was simply another citizen. Apart fromhis ancestry, he had nothing to do with either the JapaneseEmpire or other Japanese Americans. The Korematsu case is the only example of the High Court using \"strict scrutiny \"\u2014a form of judicial review that is said to be espe- cially skeptical of racial references \u2014but approving an invid- ious racial classification of a racial minority. Moreover, acase that was supposedly not about race at all has becomethe source of the controlling legal doctrine on race.(Although Korematsu had his conviction vacated on a rare writ of coram nobis decades later and received a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1998, his case has never been over-ruled and remains \"good law. \") 4 Their patriotism may have been an unrequited love, but Japanese Americans displayed it poignantly. The JapaneseAmericans, still technically classified as \"enemy aliens, \" who enlisted in the then-segregated Army proved them-selves with the ultimate sacrifice. The 442nd RegimentalCombat Team and 100th Battalion became the most highlydecorated units of their size and length of service in Ameri-can history. The law has changed, but the general culture has not. When 21-year-old Yale student Maya Lin won the competi-tion for the Vietnam War Memorial commission, her pro-found design, with its black granite displaying a stark list ofall the 58,000 Americans who died in the conflict and setinto a gash in the earth, was controversial for more than itsaesthetics. The selection process was anonymous, and theOhio-born Lin was identified by only a number until hersketches were selected. Once her face was attached to herart, there were murmurings that she was the wrong choicebecause she was a \"gook. \" Although her monument has become one of the top tourist attractions in the nation 's capital, bringing together veterans, protesters, and families Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 21Young people at a Chinatown polling station, Los Angeles, California, 1992. \u00a9 Joseph Sohm; ChromoSohm Inc./CORBISwho make crayon rubbings of their love ones ' names, the reticent sculptor still expresses shock at the attempts to dis-credit her because of race. Hate crimes against Asian Americans are a brutal form of the perpetual foreigner syndrome. The 1982 murder of Vin-cent Chin is only the most notorious example. The ChineseAmerican engineer was clubbed to death in Detroit by twowhite autoworkers who, accusing him of being responsiblefor their woes, took a baseball bat to his head. The case onlybecame more widely known when the judge sentenced theperpetrators to probation and a $3,780 fine. Numerousother cases have been recorded around the nation, withattackers such as the \"dot-busters \" in New Jersey who assaulted Indian immigrants and killed two in their violentspree, and others who have taken guns, knives, and fists toAsian Americans as they recall Vietnam or kung fu movies. Yet I am an optimist. I know I am a citizen whatever oth- ers might think. And I believe that by working togethercooperatively and constructively, we can forge a sense ofcommunity that also allows dissent, a unity that containsdiversity. By engaging in the continual process this chal-lenge requires of us, we will make the promise of our nationthe reality of our lives. At a minimum, an open societyrequires that each of us accept all of us as equals. The perpetual foreigner syndrome can be addressed through public policy. Most importantly, the perpetualforeigner syndrome requires that we acknowledge ourown feelings and actions. As the questions about \"where are you really from? \" demonstrate, many of us sometimes think about race without even realizing that it is on ourminds. We are unconscious of our own stereotyping,despite our insistence that we are striving for an ideal ofcolor-blindness. Yet it happens to Asian Americans often:our civil rights violated twice over when even incidentssuch as assaults that involve racial epithets \u2014\"chink \" or \"jap\" or \"gook \"\u2014are regarded as something other than hate crimes. The perpetual foreigner syndrome suggests that to under- stand the complexities of race, we must use a paradigm thatis not exclusively black and white \u2014in literal and figurative terms. In literal terms, if \"American \" means \"white \" and \"minority \" means \"black, \" then individuals who are neither white nor black end up being neither American nor minor-ity. They are excluded altogether as foreigners who lackrights, even if they are in fact native-born Asian Americans,Latinos, or of mixed-race backgrounds. In figurative terms,if racial issues involve only villains and victims, then it isimpossible to resolve problems without identifying wrong-doers who are bigoted. The historical, structural, and subtleforms of racial disparities become easy to ignore, even ifthey are as severe as the isolated and spectacular incidentsof hardcore racism. It is possible and crucial to include Asian Americans, Latinos, and individuals of mixed-race backgrounds, with-out in any manner denigrating the unique experiences ofAfrican Americans. Demagogues may introduce AsianAmericans as the \"model minority \" (another myth requir- ing critical thought) to send the none-too-subtle message toAfrican Americans that \"they made it, why can 't you? \" Yet efforts to broaden the discussion of race need not come atthe expense of African Americans. The struggles of variousgroups can complement one another instead. They can gainstrength by uniting through principle. To do so, it is necessary to include individuals and com- munities that are neither black nor white in the decision-making that constitutes democracy and to consider theconcerns of these persons and groups. Among other con-crete measures, it is important to maintain accurate andcurrent statistics \u2014on matters ranging from housing segre- gation, educational attainment, health care, income levels,and political representation \u2014to determine both the progress that has been made and the problems that remain.Any program that is meant for all citizens must be accessi-ble in operation to all citizens. Any program that is targetedat disadvantaged segments of the population should under-take an objective consideration of who should be a benefi-ciary, rather than relying on assumptions. The perpetual foreigner syndrome also shows us that some lines that are supposedly based on citizenship actuallycover up lines that are based on race. Because the former ispermissible and the latter is not, it becomes easy to ration-alize distinctions among people as involving citizenshiprather than race. To overcome this tendency, government officials could give greater scrutiny to classifications that seem to be basedon citizenship to determine if they are racially motivated orproduce racial effects. Of course, the equal protection clauseof the Constitution \u2014the source of the strongest protections of our rights \u2014provides guarantees to all persons and not only citizens. The Supreme Court has interpreted this language insome instances in favor of persons generally and in otherinstances as restricted to citizens alone. It may require funda-mental changes to our society, though, to achieve the sameconsensus about citizenship that has developed over race. Meanwhile, our civic culture depends on genuine dialogue among equals. Leadership and grassroots efforts that furtherthe process of forming coalitions ought to be encouraged,supported, and funded. Working constructively and cooper-atively, we can progress toward social justice. FRANK H. W U IS AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF LAW AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY .

But it has becomeby so much the dominant rationale for the historical impulse that we risk neglectingother reasons history repays study. Indeed, the two vast injunctions of the discipline \u2014 toward memory and against repetition \u2014are more at odds than we typically recognize. All history is, ultimately, local, specific to a time and place and culture \u2014and in that sense unique. The more one remembers the details of a story, the less clear its moral is. History is not a bin of aphorisms;historians are not Aesop-manqu \u00e9s. Among the other reasons to study history, a better understanding of the present is the most seemingly straightforward. We are at a certain place along the path; knowing how we got here canshake loose the impression that our current arrangements are destined, natural, and fixed. Thatthe present came into being as a result of the choices and desires of the men and women whopreceded us implies the contingency of the present and suggests the malleability of the future.Nothing is bound to be the way it is; that this or that happened is not the same as saying that itcould not have happened otherwise. The following two articles \u2014one an original piece of writing, the other, a reprint from a neglected classic \u2014are guerrilla raids on a couple of the more remote provinces of history. They describe, in turn, a forced march of Cherokee from Florida to Oklahoma conducted early in the19th century and a sequence of letters between a Portuguese and an African king dating from the15th. The incidents in themselves are minor, small craft in an ocean of event. Yet they illuminatethe larger tides that capsized continents, and in their wealth of detail, remind us that history islived by individuals, however much or little they are the authors of their fates. The rise of slavery, the need to justify its self-evident cruelties, the rapidity with which these legitimations became accepted, the effect of this trade upon African societies; these are the largerissues around which Lopes ' depiction of the correspondence between a medieval Portuguese and Kongolese king revolve. Similarly, Jahoda 's account is about nothing less than the expropriation and extermination of a people \u2014or rather, of many peoples \u2014but it takes place around long- extinguished campfires in the north of Florida in the spring of 1813. It is in the lived details thesestories provide that we embark not merely on a scholarly but on what was once unapologeticallycalled a sentimental education \u2014an education in the sort of complex and humane understanding that ought to inform our conduct today. Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 23HISTORY as SENTIMENTAL EDUCATION A Preface to Holy Ground and The Destruction of the Kingdom of Kongo CRIn the north the scarlet council fires burned long and high on frost-touched nights in the springof 1813. It was the Moon of the Running Sap,and the United States and Britain were at war. Tecumtha of the Shawnees of Ohio was urging Amer-ica's Indians to declare for the British and push out of Indian land forever the rude settlers who appearedto think they were the only Americans whomattered. The Prophet Tenskwatawa, Tecumtha 's brother, was traveling from tribe to tribe exhortingtheir clans to rebellion as the sight your rifles! Have nofears\u2014your lives are charmed! Stand up to the foe; he is a weakling and a coward! O red brothers, fallupon him! Wound, rend, tear, and flay, scalp, andleave him the wolves and buzzards! O Shawneebraves! O Potawatomi men! \" Had not the Great Spirit first made the Shawnees before he made the Frenchand English out of his breast, the Dutch out of hisfeet, and the American Long Knives out of hishands? \"All these inferior races of man he made white and placed them beyond the Stinking Lake, \" Tenskwatawa shouted as black smoke vanishedupward into a blacker sky where stars glittered crispand blue-white. Now it was time to drive the inferiorraces back across the Stinking Lake. The British mustbe used to help exterminate the Americans; after-ward, the united Indians could deal similarly withthe British. 24 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002HOLY GROUND \"Away back in that time in\u20141492\u2014there was a manby the name of Columbuscame from across the greatocean, and he discoveredthe country for the whiteman. . . . What did he findwhen he first arrived here?Did he find a white manstanding on the continentthen? HARJO, CREEK by Gloria JahodaMany of America 's original settlers listened spellbound to the compelling oratory of Tecumtha and Tenskwatawa as itechoed through their ebony forests. Soon exhortations tovengeance were dividing tribes into hostile factions of mod-erates and fanatics, none more bitterly than the southernCreeks. The Creeks, so called by the whites because most ofthe subtribes that comprised the nation lived on rivers andstreams, owned sprawling fertile lands in Georgia andAlabama. Rivers that flowed red with Georgia clay, the Flintand Chattahoochee and Ocmulgee, and Alabama streamswhose slower brown waters moved under high canopies oflongleaf pines and moss-draped live oaks, the Coosa, Tal-lapoosa, Tombigbee, and Alabama, belonged by tradition tothe Creeks. Farther south lived a scattering of Spaniards inwest Florida, whose capital, Pensacola, was a boisterous townfull of an assortment of outlaws, pirates between expeditions,petty Spanish officialdom, and dark-eyed senoritas who wel- comed the visiting British army and navy with enthusiasm.The British Indian trading firm of Panton Leslie and Com-pany was based in Pensacola too. In the 321 years sinceColumbus had begun exterminating the Tainos of the WestIndies, America 's Indians had become dependent on the goods traders sold them: muzzle-loading rifles, keen-honedknives, osnaburg cloth, flannel and calico and sturdy blan- kets, brightly colored glass beads, and also potent whiskey. No tribe relied on traders more than the Creeks; they took to the white man 's ways so readily that they were con- sidered a \"civilized \" tribe. Parties of Creeks regularly jour- neyed from Georgia and Alabama to exchange skins andfurs at Pensacola; many Creek women had married traders.Names like McGillivray, Farquharson, Weatherford, andMcIntosh were common in the war towns and peace townsthat lined ferny southern riverbanks. The Creeks had appro-priated white customs that suited them \u2014cloth dress, hunt- ing weapons and ammunition, the keeping of peachorchards and livestock. But in most of their minds therewas no doubt that their lands were theirs forever. \"They are our life and breath, \" said one of their chiefs, Yahola Micco. \"If we part with them we part with our blood. \" The Creeks, though not as drastically as Tecumtha 's Shawnees, had already felt the pressure of white expansioninto their country. They watched horrified as Americanfrontiersmen killed game not only for food but for fun. TheCreeks had taken a long step into the 19th century, at thesame time that they had also been pushed back from theAtlantic Coast they had once known. Some were fatalists:what would be, would be. But some were not. When Tecumtha 's Religion of the Dancing Lakes came to young Creek braves, they were ready to believe in it. As theygyrated, leaders of the dance carried red sticks thatTecumtha 's followers said would show the direction from which the whites were coming. Any Indian who bore a redstick could not be injured. Soon council fires were also burn-ing in the heavy, humid nights of the South. In the Creek wartown of Tuckabatchee, 5,000 people crowded the mainsquare to watch Red Stick dancers whirl naked except forbreechclouts and eagle feathers. As the hard, hammeringmusic of rattles and the wails of reed flutes rose and fell in theperfumed darkness, the Red Stick men undulated into the chofoka, the town meetinghouse, while sweat poured down their burnished faces. In ringing tones, they prophesied mir-acles. Soon afterward, in rapid succession, came a comet, ameteor shower, and a mild earthquake. Could anyone doubtTecumtha when he said that the earth would tremble whenhe stamped his foot upon it? The hotheaded warriors of theCreeks did not. But Lumhe Chati, Red Eagle, had misgivings.The whites he knew in southern Alabama had been friendly.Why could the two peoples not live together? Red Eagle was born Bill Weatherford, son of a white trader and a Creek mother whose maiden name had been Tait. Thelands he knew best were the pinewoods and swamps wherethe Tombigbee and the Alabama rivers joined, a few milesnorth of the site of the ancient Indian town of Mabila. TheMabila Indians, obliterated by conflict and disease, hadalready passed into history, along with the Natchez and Timu-cuas and Calusas and Apalachees. Now Mabila (the French,when they had owned it, had called it Mobile) belonged to theCreeks.

Used with permission.forests and sluggish coastal rivers, past broad bays full of marsh grasses shin-ing darkly in the southern sun-light. The place of pilgrimage inPensacola was the store ofPanton Leslie and Com-pany. Also in Pensacola, asAmerican frontiersmenknew, British soldiers, withthe compliance of theSpanish, were trainingbands of Creek Indians inorganized warfare. These par-ticular Creeks had left their oldlands in Georgia and Alabama tobecome Siminoli, wanderers. The main body of the tribe had severed its ties with them. A Creek in Tuckabatchee was as much like a Seminole of steamingFlorida as an urban Yankee merchant who carried a gold-headed cane was like a squatter in the hinterlands who livedon deer, opossum, and raccoon meat. The Creeks consideredtheir Siminoli brothers \"wild men. \" Red Eagle, like so many of his nation, admired the efficiency of white civilization. Hefound the Religion of the Dancing Lakes excessive, the flightof the Siminoli futile, and the belief in the invincibility ofthose who carried red sticks grotesque. During the Summer Moon, in July 1813, 90 Alabama Creek warriors set out for Pensacola with laden packhorses.Their leader was the half-breed Peter McQueen, chief of theTallassee band. They made their way slowly through thedank heat. Frequently, they paused to rest in the shade ofhigh pines along sepia streamlets where there was freshwater to drink. To the whites of the Alabama frontier settle-ments, the group of traveling Indians was frightening. TheBritish fleet had been seen off Pensacola, and it was com-mon knowledge that the British and Spanish were incitingIndians and selling them ammunition. From cabin to far-flung cabin word was passed that the Creeks, urged on byRed Stick braves, were planning a massacre. AlabamaColonel James Caller called out a ragtag territorial militiaand crossed the Tombigbee to Sisemore 's Ferry on the Alabama. There, on the river 's western bank, he bivouacked for the night. His recruits listened to the calling of owls andthe thumping of marsh rabbits, wondering if the noisescame from animal or human throats. The militia had passed through the town of Jackson, named for the American major-general who had written such stirringrecruiting TO ARMS! . . Are we the titled slaves of George the Third? The military conscripts of Napoleon? Or the frozen peasants of the Russian Czar? No \u2014we are the freeborn sons of the only republick now exist- ing in the world. \" Andrew Jackson, who had known the Indian wars of the Appa- lachians as a boy, knew there were no republics among Indi- ans. Most red men understood his contempt for their race. The man whose name was an inspiration to Colonel Caller was Jacksa Chula Harjo to the Creeks \u2014 \"Jackson, old and fierce. \" Some said he was mad. Neighboring Choctaws called him, more succinctly, \"The Devil. \" On the morning of July 26, Caller started the laborious crossing to the east side of the Alabama. Horses swam by theside of long dugout canoes; it took most of the morning toget the animals across. At noon, Caller 's party halted at the cow pens of a frontiersman, where they were reinforced by acompany under the command of Dixon Bailey, a mixed-blood Creek who had been educated in Philadelphia at whiteexpense. Bailey 's men carried the same mixture of rifles and shotguns as Caller 's; they were as ready to fight, and their frontier horses were as sturdy. They wanted their pay, how-ever, more than they wanted glory. By July 27, Peter McQueen 's Creeks were returning from Pensacola with their purchases: rifles and shotguns like thosethe Long Knives carried, the bright cloth Creek wives fancied,metal fishing books, sharp hunting knives, and the British-made cookware that had replaced Creek pottery. The morningwas torrid. Before noon, McQueen 's party stopped by a tiny rivulet named Burnt Corn Creek, where they cooked and atethe game they had caught. The smoke of their fire rose slowlyinto the pinetops of the little barren where they were resting. Without warning, the Americans fell on them with shrill yells, forcing them to plunge into the river. Soon the Ameri-cans were losing Creek packhorses and plundering the waresof Panton Leslie and Company. Only a few bothered to pur-sue the Indians swimming down the Alabama. Then ColonelCaller ordered a retreat to a nearby hill in order to consolidatehis position. But the greediest of his followers held onto theirbooty as they drove their horses before them, while the 26 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002 Jackson had turned Indian against Indian in his determination to subjugate every red man in the United States.remaining Indians disappeared into a nearby swamp. The militiamen clung to their new possessions thinking them-selves victorious, while Caller and Bailey tried to rally them.But the Indians rushed out from the swamp brandishing theguns they had never relinquished. From the swamp they ranto a bed of tall reeds, where they began shooting at the whitesin the open woodland. This was more than Caller 's militia could endure. Two-thirds of them fled into the surroundingforest. Caller himself, who had marked no trail, became lostin a labyrinth of pond and hammock land and saw-palmettothickets. When he was found 15 days later he was \"starved almost to death and bereft of his senses, \" babbling idiocies in his verdant hell. For him the war of the United States ofAmerica versus the Creek Indian nation had had an inglori-ous beginning. The prosperous mixed-bloods of southern Alabama were frightened. The white settlers were more so. The Battle ofBurnt Corn would surely be avenged by the Indians. Againthe council fires began spiraling Creek towns: midnights, and the whites and mixed-bloodsheard it as they tossed sleepless on their cots. They knew theyhad to take shelter. A mile east of the Alabama on cypress-studded Lake Ten- saw lived Samuel Mims, who had built himself a ramblingframe house and large storage sheds. He had plenty of freshwater from nearby springs. Here the settlers quickly erected astockade around an acre of sandy Alabama earth; they left500 portholes in the fence, each one three and a half feetfrom the ground. They put up two unwieldy gates, one onthe east and one on the west. Within the fort they hewed outtemporary cabins, and at the southwest corner they started ablockhouse. To the south was a potato field, dotted by a fewramshackle slave cabins. Between the fence and Lake Tensawtall slash pines flashed high needles in the sun; on the northwere dense cane swamps, on the east trackless marshes. FortMims was possibly the most vulnerably situated outpost inthe history of the American frontier. Men might hide unde-tected on any side of it. The settlers did not wait for the blockhouse to be finished. They poured in with their featherbeds and cookpots, spin-ning wheels and axes and dogs and rations of dried meat.When Major Daniel Beasley arrived to take charge, he foundtwo of the youngest men in what passed for command. Thepicketing needed to be strengthened, the blockhouse to becompleted and two more built and scouts sent out to tell anyfriendly Indians that if they were hungry there was food forthem at Fort Mims. Possibly Beasley himself believed thatthere were friendly Indians even after the unprovoked attackat Burnt Corn Creek. By this time there were 553 peoplejostling each other in the fort: civilians, whites, half-bloods,officers and recruits, black slaves, and bedraggled women infaded calico who nursed the inevitable sick in the Alabamaswamp country in high summer. Malaria and dysenteryclaimed fresh victims daily; within the stockade the stench oftheir suffering was undiluted by wind. Inland Alabama has no summer winds. In the swamps the water shimmereddarkly and the slow snouts of alligators made semicircularripples as they moved forward; water moccasins were curledover looping branches. The smell of sulfurous marsh gasdrifted over the stockade to mix with the smell of disease andspoiling food. And thus Fort Mims waited. Meanwhile Peter McQueen, the literate leader of the fate- ful expedition to Pensacola, received an interesting commu-nication from British and Spanish agents in Pensacola whohad heard of Burnt Corn Creek. \"Fight the Americans, \" they urged him. \"If they prove too hard for you, send your women and children to Pensacola and we will send them to Havana;and if you should be compelled to fly yourselves, and theAmericans should prove too hard for both of us, there are ves-sels enough to take us all off together. \" The advice was bitterly debated in long chofoka councils. During these debates the young Chief Red Eagle sat pondering, his eyes flashing rest-lessly over his gathered tribesmen, his lips compressed. In hislong blue-black hair he wore two eagle feathers. Red Eagle 's father had been a white Georgian, his mother, a mixture ofCreek and Scottish and French. He himself had elected hisCreek identity. His brother, John Weatherford, had taken thewhite man 's way. He had not felt the same strong bonds to Creek earth and to the mystical Creek religion which taughtthe identity of man and nature under Isakita Immissi, theMaster of Breath. Red Eagle knew that so far the Creek War had really been a civil war. His half-brother David Tait was a Red Stick dancer;a sister and all her sons were also in the war party, while herhusband, McNac, had fled to Fort Mims. When Red Eaglespoke at last in the chofoka it was to say tersely: \"Do not avenge Burnt Corn. Civil War will only weaken us. \" In Fort Mims the Creeks had many relatives, and there were whiteand black women and children there as innocent as the redwomen and children of the Creek villages. Red Eagle was lis-tened to, for he was trusted as a man of honor, but the RedStick warriors outvoted him. They then asked him to leadthem on a Fort Mims expedition. No one had a better repu-tation than Red Eagle as a fighter and a commander of men.For the sake of his honor he consented; his loyalty was withhis nation. The fort would be shut tight; the battle could beturned into a token charge against an impregnable target,and such a token would surely satisfy the families of the war-riors killed by the whites at Burnt Corn. On August 29, two young blacks were ordered to mind some Fort Mims cattle in a nearby field. Not long after theypassed through the gate they came running back with thenews that they had seen 24 Indians in war paint. Hurriedly, anofficer rode to the spot with the blacks and a detachment ofhorses. There was not a sign of the enemy. The officer and hishorsemen were disgusted. At sunset the blacks were draggedback to Fort Mims. One of them was tied to the stockade andbeaten until his dark back was striped red with blood. Theowner of the other refused to let his slave be punished forlying and was ordered by Major Beasley to leave the fort by 10 Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 27o'clock on the morning of August 30. By then the slave who had been flogged left the fortagain to tend the cattle. Once more he sawa large group of Indians in the nearby for-est. But this time, his back swollen withlashes, he fled to a distant settlementwhere he might be believed. In themeantime, the other slave 's owner had abandoned his defense. The hap-less black was tied to the stockade inthe hot sun where he waited to bebeaten. Some of the soldiers sprawledon the ground laughed at him; othersindifferently played cards. A group ofteenagers danced by the open gate,while nearly a hundred small childrenfrolicked among the tents and, giggling,hid from each other behind the cabins.Inside, the sick moaned fitfully. Red Eagle and his men \u2014a thousand Red Sticks \u2014waited in the swamps, their view of the fort obscured by thick cane.Their faces were painted black and their arms and legs yellow,for they had taken the path of war. They carried medicinebundles, the red sticks of invincibility, and their tomahawks,and they also carried rifles and guns from Panton Leslie andCompany. At noon they heard the fort 's drum summoning the officers and soldiers to lunch. For a breathless momentlonger they waited. Then, with a massive whoop, they sprangforward. Only then was Red Eagle close enough to see, to hishorror, that the fort gate stood wide. His warriors rushedahead. Beasley hurried to the gate and tried to shut it, but itwas banked in Alabama soil and wouldn 't move. In a single blow Red Sticks felled Beasley, then left him to crawl behindthe gate, where he died of his gashes. Five designatedprophets began dancing Red Stick dances; some of the sol-diers managed to get to their weapons and shot them down.Red Eagle was shouting, trying to hold his men back. \"See!\" he roared out, \"the Red Stick prophets weren 't invincible! \" But there was no stopping the Indians. They killed soldiers,settlers, blacks, women, and children. Outside the picketsanother group of prophets had gathered to dance and shriektheir incantations. When the Indians set fire to the main building as well as the sheds, the flames fanned into a sunburst, and their smoke sti-fled the people of Fort Mims. \"Oh, God, I am a dead man! \" cried the father of Samuel Mims as his scalp was lifted from the pulp of his head. Somebody shouted, \"To the bastion! To the bastion! \" A Spaniard from Pen- sacola knelt with sandspurs digging into his knees, crossing himself. A black slave exultantly delivered a white child to one of the Red Sticks. Fort Mims burned on, and its stench now was that of a charnel house. Five hours later the Indians collected the booty that was left and melted away to spend the night in the forest, its stolid trunks interlaced against the hectic light from the burning cotton gin. Not until midnight did the flames subside. By then the Red Sticks slept by their small camp fires. But Red Eagle did not sleep. In the fetid fog of early morning, he ordered his braves to bury the Fort Mims dead. Quietly they began laying thembetween rows of potatoes, covering them with loose dirtand thickly clustered potato leaves. But there were toomany corpses, and the Indian wounded were moaning inpain, begging to be returned to their villages. Some were putinto palmetto canoes on the Alabama; others left on foot. Aparty of them staggered to Burnt Corn Creek, where theydied. In the forest, terrified dogs ran and yelped. Also in theforest a Red Stick warrior named Sanota hid. In Fort Mims,he had found a woman who had once befriended him. Hehad hurried away with the woman and her children,explaining to his fellows that he wanted them as slaves. Forweeks he hunted game for the little family; eventually,when they were strong enough, he guided them to a whitesettlement and then faded back into the wilderness fromwhich he had come. At Fort Mims, a party of militia arrivedto bury the dead. A young captain swallowed hard: \"It is a promiscuous ruin. \" Early in September, at an inn in Nashville, Tennessee, Jacksa Chula Harjo lay dying. The blood from a duelingwound was soaking through the two mattresses underneathhim. All the frock-coated physicians of Nashville were gath-ered gravely at his bedside, sure the end was near. His leftshoulder had been shattered by one bullet, and another had 28 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002 For Andrew Jackson, the war of the United States of America versus the Creek Indian nation had had an inglorious beginning.\u00a9 Bettmann/CORBISimbedded itself in the upper bone of his left arm. All but one of the doctors agreed on amputation. Jackson was only half-conscious, but as he heard the rising and falling of theirvoices he began to realize what was being said. \"I'll keep my arm,\" he rasped. On September 12 he was still alive and convalescing at the Hermitage, his Nashville plantation. He was in bed when thenews of the Fort Mims massacre came to him. \"By the Eter- nal, these people must be saved! \" His voice grew stronger as he raised himself on feather pillows and cried vengeance forthe whites of the Alabama frontier. Soon he was sitting upand announcing to the men of his regiment: \"The health of your general is restored. He will command in person! \" Shortly thereafter he swung onto a tall horse to ride against Red Eagle and the Red Sticks in their Moon of Roast-ing Ears. Fastidious politicians in Washington hadn 't liked Andrew Jackson when he had represented his district in Con-gress. \"A tall, lanky, uncouth-looking personage, \" they had sniffed. \"Queue down his back tied with an eel skin . . . Dress singular . . . Manners those of a rough backwoodsman. \" But backwoodsmen were better at dealing with rebellious Indianchiefs than perfumed dandies were. In Winchester, Virginia,another \"rough backwoodsman \" prepared with his regiment to march against the Creeks. His name was David Crockett. Driving hard into Alabama, where Choctaw Chief Push- mataha joined them (Choctaws and Creeks were traditionalenemies), Jackson 's forces descended on Black Warriors ' Town, a Creek settlement on the Black Warrior River, wherethey sacked what they could and then razed the place. TheCreeks had fled before them. Then Jackson turned south,establishing forts as he went. By early November he wascamped at Ten Islands, near present-day Gadsden, fromwhere he sent out his subordinate John Coffee to destroy thenearby Creek town of Tallussahatchee. Just after sunrise, Cof-fee's men rushed up to the doors of the Creeks ' houses; in a matter of minutes they had killed every warrior in the town,though \"the enemy fought with savage fury. \" The surprised Red Sticks, Coffee noted, \"met [death], with all its horrours, without shrinking or complaining. Not one asked to bespared, but fought as long as they could stand or sit. \" Coffee 's troops were not satisfied with killing the 186 warriors of Tal-lussahatchee. For good measure they shot down women andbabies until the ground ran vermilion. They went from houseto house slashing and firing. Tallussahatchee had been apeaceful little town without any defenses whatever. One ofthe Indian women \"had at least twenty balls blown through her,\" David Crockett noted. Afterward he added, \"We shot them like dogs. \" The avenging of Fort Mims was crueler than the original massacre since it involved a place utterly withoutfortifications. Fort Mims, Red Eagle had assumed, would haveprotection. Not a warrior escaped from Tallussahatchee. Oneof the Creek houses had 45 people inside it when Coffee 's men put the torch to it. The Indians ' screams didn 't bother the soldiers; they spent the next day \"eating potatoes from the cellar stewed in the oil of the Indians we had burned upthe day before which had run down on them. \"A few days later, Jackson led his troops into Talladega. \"We shall repeat Tallussahatchee, \" he said confidently. But his ranks broke; veteran army men blamed it on draftees. Laterthe draftees started to mutiny. Jackson held them at bay withhis rifle resting on the neck of his horse; his left arm was stilluseless. \"I'll shoot dead the first man who makes a move to leave! \" he thundered. That ended the mutiny. The warriors of eight Creek towns gathered in Artussee on the east bank of the Tallapoosa River, at the mouth of CalebeeCreek. It was a place sacred to the Red Sticks, \"beloved ground \" that had been reserved for Creek war councils. Surely the magic sticks, the incantations, and the Dance ofthe Lakes would protect them here. But the Red Sticks hadn 't reckoned on the bizarre reinforcements which arrived toswell Jackson 's ranks. Four hundred friendly Indians, mostly Choctaws but some Creeks who opposed the Red Sticks,arrived in the care of a Jewish trader named Abraham Morde-cai who had a reputation as \"a queer fellow \" among the Creeks. He traded his wares for ginseng root, hickory nut oil,and pelts. What the Indians didn 't know was that hickory nut oil was considered a delicacy by French epicures in NewOrleans. Mordecai sold it there for many times more thanwhat he had paid for it. Sometimes Mordecai was \"amorous. \" He had been charmed by a Creek squaw, wife of a Red Stickwarrior, and emerged from this intrigue with a thrashing thathad left him unconscious and his trading post a heap ofashes. The Red Sticks recognized Mordecai only too wellwhen they saw him. They also recognized many of theirbrother Creeks who, with Jackson 's soldiers, put the torch to Artussee 's houses. This time 200 Creek Indians were burned alive; 400 of their wooden houses and outbuildings went upin smoke, and women and children and infants perished ina second avenging of Fort Mims. When the news reached RedEagle, he led his warriors to Ecunchate, the most holy groundof all, where they believed they would truly be unconquer-able. Not only would red sticks protect them, but stout fenc-ing and a location atop a river bluff. Ecunchate symbolizedthe relationship of the Creeks to the earth. Its sacredness rep-resented the sacredness of every other inch of Creek soilwhere Creeks hunted or tilled. In marched the troops of Jacksa Chula Harjo. The Creeks hastily evacuated their wives and children into the sanctuaryof surrounding swamps across the river. Most of the RedSticks also were able to escape when Jackson 's cavalry failed to understand orders and charged. But the soldiers were exul-tant; they had the destroyer of Fort Mims, Red Eagle himself,at bay. Red Eagle, however, was too quick for them. He leapedonto his gray horse and began a wild ride along the banks ofthe Alabama. With Jackson 's cavalry in pursuit, horse and man flew against the wind until they reached a high bluff 15feet above the river. Red Eagle hesitated only a moment.Then, \"with a mighty bound \" he and his horse pitched over the bluff to the river below, where they disappeared beneaththe waves. Incredulous, Jackson 's horsemen watched horse and man rise again. Red Eagle held his horse 's mane with one hand and his rifle with the other. Ecunchate, the Holy Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 29Ground, had been reduced to smoldering ruins, but Red Eagle survived. The winter of 1814 passed with Jackson on an elu-sive Red Eagle 's trail, while Jackson 's troops laid waste to Creek towns. Now Red Eagle was determined never to giveup. Jackson had turned Indian against Indian in his determi-nation to subjugate every red man in the United States. At theHorseshoe Bend of the Tallapoosa River, Red Eagle gatheredhis Red Sticks to build a breastwork of logs; assailants wouldbe exposed to cross fire. Into the Horseshoe Bend poured themilitant braves of Hillabee Town, Oefuske, Oakchoie,Eufaulahatchee, Yauca, Hickory Ground, and the Fish PondTown, all of them waiting for Andrew Jackson who had beenjoined by a regiment of Cherokees from north Georgia andthe Carolinas. These Cherokees believed that in the Red Sticksthey were fighting renegade outlaws and that Jackson cher-ished their loyalty and would reward them well. It was theCherokees who captured the Red Sticks ' canoes by stealth and took them to the other side of the river, where they were soon filled with Choctaws, Cherokees, and Americans whopaddled furiously across to throw torches into the warriors ' midst at Horseshoe Bend. The breastwork went up in smoke.The defenses of the Red Sticks crumbled. The Indians died atknife- and gunpoint, red sticks clutched in their charredhands. Most of the warriors who tried to escape by plunginginto the Alabama were caught by Jackson 's men and drowned, their heads wrenched by hostile hands under thebrown water. After it was all over, gunsmoke drifted above theTallapoosa while mockingbirds sang obliviously and sunlightstreamed through the vapor onto the corpses. Only 10 RedSticks had escaped. But one of them was Red Eagle, and at thejunction of the Coosa and Tallapoosa he tried heartening theother nine. It was no use. This, too, was Beloved Ground, butthe demoralized Creek warriors had lost their faith in theReligion of the Dancing Lakes, in Tecumtba 's prophecies and red sticks and the blood-tingling music of war. They left RedEagle to muse at the Beloved Ground alone. One evening, in front of his quarters, Jackson was \"accosted by an unarmed, light-colored Indian \" who wore and Jackson? \" \"Yes?\" \"I am Bill Weatherford. \" Inside, Red Eagle explained why he had come to surrender to his antagonist. \"I can oppose you no longer. I have done you much injury. I should havedone you more, but my warriors are killed. I am in yourpower. Dispose of me as you please. \" \"You are not in my power, \" Andrew Jackson answered slowly. \"I had ordered you brought to me in chains, but youhave come of your own accord. You see my camp. You see my arms. You know my object. If you think you can contendagainst me in battle go and head your warriors. \" \"Ah!\" Red Eagle 's smile was dry. \"Well may such language be addressed to me now. There was a time \"\u2014he paused \u2014\"a time when I could have answered you. I could animate myfighters to battle, but I cannot animate the dead. General Jack-son, I have nothing to request for myself, but I beg you to sendfor the women and children of the war party who have beendriven to the woods without an ear of corn. They never didany harm. Kill me instead, if the white people want it done. \" Wordlessly Jackson offered Red Eagle a glass of brandy. The warrior drank it. \"Save the wives and children of the Creeks, and I will persuade to peace any Red Sticks remainingin my nation, \" he said. Deliberately, Jackson nodded. Then he extended his hand. Red Eagle took it, looked at his adver-sary's craggy features for a long moment and then, bowing, departed. With that handshake, the two principal architects of the ultimate fate of the American Indian had sealed a bargain.Red Eagle 's leadership in war had angered America. It had also convinced Andrew Jackson that America 's frontiers would always be frontiers while there were Indians toannoy the settlers. The Indians must go. They couldn 't be exterminated wholesale because of world opinion. But theycould be uprooted and packed off to some remote corner ofthe country where they wouldn 't be in the way. This haven would belong to them, they would be told in the traditionallanguage of America 's Indian treaties, \"as long as the green grass grows and the water flows, \" provided they began bik- ing en masse with a military escort to get there. At theHorseshoe Bend of the Tallapoosa River in Alabama,Andrew Jackson silently pledged himself to the policy ofIndian Removal, which in his presidency was to becomelaw. It would be a simple law: any Indian who remained onhis ancestral lands affirming his Indian identity would be acriminal. The Indians would be relocated somewhere onthe West 's Great Plains. It didn 't matter that the Great Plains already had Indian inhabitants who could hardly beexpected to welcome red refugees. But the governmentwould tout as a mecca the grasslands and forested river bot-toms near the Red and Arkansas and Verdigris rivers, in RedEagle 's time an all but uncharted mystery. Not until five decades had passed did the Choctaw Indian Allen Wrightgive it a name \u2014perhaps not without irony. The Choctaw word for red was houma; okla meant people. Oklahoma was Indian destiny before it graced a single map. Not an Indianalive, except those who already inhabited it, considered itHoly Ground. East of the Mississippi, Ecunchate was lostland, a lost dream, and the road that led out of it foreverbecame the Trail of Tears.

In a three-masted caravel, Cao traveled in a broad arc past the Canary, Savage, Madeira and Cape Verde Islands; rounded Cape St. Vincent and Cape Nao in theMaghreb; suffered his sailors ' puns \u2014\"He who reaches Cape Nao will return or nao(not) \"; revictualed at Arguin, a slave entrepot above the Senegal River, at Fort Mina, an armed post flush with gold dust from the trans-Saharan trade, and atCape Santa Catarina below Africa 's bulge, until then the outer limit of the known world. Then, trimming his lateen sails to navigate against the prevailingheadwinds, he sailed into the Southern Hemisphere, in whose unfamiliar skiesneither his astrolabe nor his almanacs availed him further. Soon he came to theeffluence of a river whose discharge sent sweet red water and clumps of grass andbamboo for miles into the Atlantic, so he named it the Powerful River, or Rio Poderoso . Thinking it might lead him to the fabled realm of Prester John, he coasted into its mouth on an afternoon breeze. Crocodiles and hippopotamuses lay stunned by heat on banksof brilliant orchids. Flocks ofparrots chattered at sunsetfrom tangles of mangrove.Eagles wheeled overhead. Like crabs crawling along a coastline, the Portuguese hadbeen exploring the African lit-toral and the Atlantic islands for decades before Caoreached the Kingdom ofKongo. The Canaries werementioned by Pliny, who them the \"Fortu- nate Isles, \" and died observ- ing the eruption of Vesuvius in A.D. 79. The Canaries lin-gered in the European imagi-nation, \"patches of twilight in the Sea of Darkness, \" but it wasn 't until 1339 that they Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 31 by David Lopes Early 16th-century Portuguese map of Africa, created 1508.THEDESTRUCTION OF THEKINGDOM OF KONGOwere rediscovered and settled by the Portuguese. Thereafter, the pace of exploration quickened. In 1415, Prince Henry theNavigator, spurred on by his astrologer, skimmed the profitsfrom his Lusophone soap monopoly, equipped an expedition,and seized the town of Ceuta, opposite Gibraltar. In 1419, aGenoan captain in the pay of Prince Henry struck Madeira.Settlers named the first children born there Adam and Eve.The Azores and the Cape Verdes were discovered in mid-cen-tury as navigators inched down Africa 's bulge. Everywhere they went, the Portuguese kidnapped a few of the locals,brought them to Portugal, taught them Christianity, and sentthem back. Also, because they had heard from Jewish tradersabout the Mansa of Mali, a man so rich that on his hajjin 1324 he had single-handedly caused prices in Egypt to spiral,they asked about gold. Some historians wonder which motivewas more important. Others say both: It was this mixture of the deeper passions \u2014greed, wolfish, inexorable, insatiable, combined with religious passion, harsh,unassailable, death-dedicated \u2014that drove the Portuguese remorselessly on into the torrid, fever-ridden seas that lappedthe coasts of tropical Africa and beyond. What historians know of the Kongo Kingdom is fragmen- tary. Sources include contemporary European accounts, pri-vate letters, church correspondence, bills-of-lading, papalbulls, missionary memoirs, slaver propaganda, embassyappointments, oral histories, ethnographic fieldwork, and apirate 's autobiography. Researchers have combed the archives of the Vatican, Rome, Florence, Milan, The Hague, Madrid,Lisbon, London, Paris, Brussels, and Sao Tome. On splinthouses above the Congo River and in decaying hillside vil-lages, anthropologists have sat down with tape recorder andnote pad to sift the memories of old men. Despite theseefforts, there 's a lot that isn 't known. Archives in Africa were destroyed by \"cannibals \" and fires. Sources contradict each other. Descriptions are vague or hostile. Parsing the old doc-uments in the light of anthropological knowledge of present-day societies \u2014a technique favored by many but not all researchers \u2014is a bit like solving story problems by looking at the teacher 's manual, with this punchline: the manual goes to a later edition of the problem book. When the court and king of the Kongo first learned that a whale-colored people from a place called Mputu had arrived at the mouth of the Nzere , their sails \"like knives in the sun, \" the kingdom was perhaps only six generations from its founding, late in the 13th century. Like the greatempires of West Africa, the Kongo emerged by subjugatingits neighbors through war and incorporating them into abroad-reaching trading zone. The wars of conquest werenot remembered for their difficulty. One Kongo noble tolda 17th-century chronicler that the original inhabitants ofhis region were small men with big heads, fat bellies, andshort legs. When they fell down, he said, they had troublegetting up. At its peak, the kingdom formed a roughsquare stretching from the mouth of the river to Malebo(Stanley) Pool, and from Luanda Island into present-day Angola. It would have been slightly larger than Portugal,and nearly as populous. The king 's household, an enclosure a mile and a half around, contained walled paths, palisades, decorated huts,courtyards, and gardens. One early traveler compared it tothe Cretan labyrinth. Trumpeters and soldiers stood guardat its entrance. Mbanza Kongo, the capital city, rose on acliff overhanging a river and a narrow valley fringed withforest. On its fertile plateau two springs gave crystal-clearwater. Estimates of the population vary: at the time the Por-tuguese arrived, 60,000 to 100,000 people were said to livein the capital; the only other town of note, the capital of thecoastal province of Sonyo, had a population of about15,000, and the various other provincial capitals were con-siderably smaller. From his throne of ivory and sculpted wood, the king ruled through an elaborate network of councilors and gov-ernors, clan elders and local chieftains, priests and electors.He maintained that network through alliance, marriage,trade, and force. Of his 12 councilors, four by statute werewomen. In theory, the king could neither declare war noropen a road without the councilors ' consent; in practice, the king 's power depended on his political skills. A strong king, for example, could replace his governors at will; aweak one struggled to maintain their loyalty. No rule of pri-mogeniture applied. Instead, clan elders picked the futureking from among the sons of the dying king 's lesser wives. Despite the fact that successions were sometimes bloody, itwas a system that ensured continuity: anyone sharp enoughto earn the clan elders ' loyalty was usually savvy enough to rule. Sometimes border provinces tried to break away, andsometimes peasants led local tax revolts, but the benefits oftrade, on the one hand, and the power of the king to levyan 80,000-troop army, on the other, were usually enough todiscourage rebellion. When a man died, he was officially mourned for eight days. Then the man 's principal wife led the relatives to the nearest river, cut the belt that her husband had worn in life,and threw it in. The river carried the belt away, \"together with the sadness for the lost one. \" During that period, male kin wore white whenever they approached the corpse \u2014white being the color of the dead. On the eighth day, womenapplied a mix of powdered charcoal to their faces and cheststo signify the end of mourning, though a variety of rites andprohibitions were in effect for up to a year thereafter. Thedead were buried in a special thicket. On their graves wereplaced objects indicating their status in life: chairs and cupson the tombs of title holders; baskets of roots and herbs onthose of curers; hammers, bellows, and anvils on those ofsmiths. On the tombs of hunters were placed the skulls ofwild beasts. Besides the ancestors, there were gods of earth, water, and sky, with their accompanying cults, symbols, powers, andpriestly castes. Some governed the fertility of the land; othersthe success of war or the acquisition of wealth and office. For 32 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002 the Kongo, a chance encounter with a peculiarly shaped twig or stone was loaded with meaning; whirlwinds incarnatedthe spirits of noble ancestors; grubs caused rain; albinos,dwarves, and twins could cure infertility, kill thieves, or pre-vent elephants from destroying the house; and disease wasthe invariable outcome of witchcraft. Fifteenth-centuryChristians brought with them a religion that had grownaggressive, doctrinaire, and remote; the landscape of theKongo was charged with ambiguous significance, repletewith signs and symbols of the sacred. If, as many scholars now insist, the European explorers did not \"discover \" the world \u2014it had, after all, been discov- ered by countless indigenous peoples already \u2014they never- theless inaugurated a global process of dis-enclavement,threading the first tenuous connections between the dis-persed and disparate civilizations of the earth. For many non-Westerners that process would result in destruction, dispos-session, or death. And because freedom emerged as a definingideal of the West during an era in which the worst abuses ofthat freedom were routine, our vision of the past can take ona clarity it lacked in the event, obscuring how tentative,uncertain \u2014in a word, explorative \u2014those early oceanic adventures were. More medieval than modern, the explorerslearned by going where they went. And in doing so, they notonly redrew the map, they also discovered the countless wayspeople had devised of being human. That is what makes theEuropean encounter with the Kongo \u2014the first large-scale, previously unknown civilization the Europeans came upon \u2014so riveting: one can see, in those early moments, how things might have turned out differently. In 1491, King Joao of Portugal sent to \"his royal brother \" the king of the Kongo a richly provisioned expedition thatincluded priests, carpenters, stone masons, and women, whowere to instruct the Kongo in housekeeping. (An expeditionthe following year, to the nearby island of Sao Tome,included two German printers, with printing press.) Receivedwith a jubilation that even they must have found astonish-ing, this first batch of colonizers went to work. Withinmonths, the masons had built a stone church and the priestshad baptized the king and most of the nobility. For their part, the Kongo thought that the Europeans were water spirits, gods of fertility. Painted in white and naked to thewaist, they had greeted the European colonizers in a ceremonythat was, according to the historian Ann Hilton, \"clearly an nkimba [fertility] cult assembly. \" Soon after the Europeans arrived, the brother of a traditional high priest discovered ablack stone in the shape of a cross, proving to the Kongo thatthe newly introduced religion belonged, as they had suspected,to the dimension of water and earth spirits. (After all, thewhites resembled albinos, who were thought to have specialpowers in this regard.) The Kongo king then insisted on beingbaptized before going off to war, because he wanted the pro-tection that the European ritual might give him. Given the odd ideas they had about each other \u2014the Por- tuguese, to give one example, thought that if they traveledtoo far inland the moon 's rays would swell their heads \u2014it's Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 33View of Mbanza Kongo, capital of the Kongo Kingdom, 1591. not surprising that the Kongo and the Portuguese often found each other baffling. What is surprising is how quicklythe Kongo were able to take advantage of their contact withEurope. Fruit from Asia, the Americas, and the Mediter-ranean \u2014orchards of guava, lemon, orange, pineapple \u2014throve in the Kongo tropical soil. The American cassava, or manioc tuber, replacedmillet, sorghum, and lucoas the starch of choice. Pineapple wine, sugarcane beer, English rum, and Indian ganja alljoined palm wine on the shelf of local intoxicants. TheKongo quickly adapted European technology that they founduseful: the Kongo king substituted an exotic horse tail for theelephant tail he had used as his own personal fly whisk. Thenobility saw the benefits of literacy and sent their sons \u2014and sometimes their daughters \u2014to missionary schools early on. In the mid-17th century, paper was in such demand that itcost a hen per sheet, and a common missal cost a slave. More surprising than the Kongo adoption of European crops and technical skills is the kingdom 's acceptance of some aspects of Christianity and Portuguese political organi-zation. Like Kemal Ataturk or the leaders of the Meiji Restora-tion, the kings who ruled the Kongo in the 16th and 17thcenturies responded with astonishing enterprise and creativ-ity to the European challenge. \"Not until our own time, \" asserts the historian Jan Vansina, \"would such an attempt at massive but free and selective acculturation be seen again. \" The Kongo kings embraced elements of Catholicism to givetheir rule a stronger ideological basis; they struggled to securetheir succession along Portuguese lines. And yet, despite theseingenious, sometimes heroic efforts, the Kingdom of Kongo wasdestroyed, as completely as the empires of the Aztecs or the Incas. By 1678, a visitor to Mbanza Kongo reported thatthe capital had been sacked, and that elephants were roamingin the ruins, eating bananas off the abandoned trees. In a word, the reason for the Kongo 's demise was sugar. Sugar had been known to Europe from about the 10th cen-tury. Fulcher of Chartres, who accompanied the army of theFirst Crusade and chronicled their hardships, is one of thefirst Europeans to mention it: In those cultivated fields through which we passed during our march there were certain ripe plants which the common folkcalled \"honey-cane \" and which were very much like reeds. . . . In our hunger we chewed them all day because of the taste ofhoney. However, this helped but little. But it was not until the late 15th and early 16th centuries that sugar replaced honey as the sweetener of choice, andthereafter it gradually became a staple. On that appetite thegreat sugar plantations of the Atlantic islands and Brazil flour-ished. And in their fields and mills, the institution of chattelslavery, which since Roman times had been all but extin-guished, flickered back to life. One historian has written thatthe sugar plantations prefigured the transformation of Euro-pean society, \"a total remaking of its economic and social basis. \" For Africa, that transformation would be a bitter one:it was largely in order to meet the labor demands of the Atlantic island and Brazilian cane sugar plantations that theslave ships first came to Africa, leaving in their crowded wakea subdued and chastened continent. Four centuries of slaveryhad their genesis in the cane fields outside Jerusalem. In the history of this period there is no more pivotal or enigmatic figure than Mvemba Nzinga. Known to generationsof Africans by his Christian name, Afonso I, he ruled as kingof the Kongo from 1506 to 1543. So little is known about himthat he reflects to every age something of its own image: tocontemporary Portuguese he was a figure of miracles, a soldiersaint, a Christian scholar who knew more of the Bible thanthe priests who came to instruct him. Here is how one priestdescribed him in a letter to King Manuel of Portugal: May Your Highness be informed that his Christian life is such that he appears to me not as a man but as an angel sent by theLord to this kingdom to convert it, especially when he speaksand when he preaches. For I assure Your Highness that it is hewho instructs us; better than we he knows the prophets andthe Gospel of Our Lord Jesus Christ and all the lives of thesaints and all things regarding our Mother the Holy Church,so much that if Your Highness could observe him yourself,you would be filled with admiration. He expresses things sowell and with such accuracy that it seems to me that the HolySpirit speaks always through his mouth. I must say, Lord, thathe does nothing but study and that many times he falls asleepover his books; he forgets what time it is to dine, when he isspeaking of the things of God. To later missionaries, reading these accounts in what appeared to them a lapsed and impenitent era, the age ofAfonso was a gilded moment, the focus of a consoling nos-talgia that was distinctly Christian in its location of an unre-deemed present enfolded in a grace past and future. In the1960s and 1970s, the image of Afonso underwent another seachange: to liberals, he appeared as a \"forest Othello, \" too innocent and trusting to understand that his dream of bring-ing European civilization to Africa was doomed by Europeanduplicity \u2014by priests eager to swap missals for slaves. To pan- African nationalists, he became one of the first great figures ofresistance, the black king of legend who struggled to save hispeople from bondage. The most recent scholars to have studied the early history of the Kongo, parsing the few contemporary documents withsophisticated textual and analytic tools, present a more pro-saic, complex picture. And perhaps it is because we see some-thing of ourselves in the canny and prismatic spirit whoemerges that the portrait seems at once more ambiguous andmore realistic than earlier ones. Afonso seized power in 1506, upon the death of his father, King Joao I. As the firstborn son of the king 's principal wife, Afonso was ineligible for succession. By tradition, that rightbelonged to sons of the king 's lesser wives. But Afonso had the Portuguese in his silk tabard pocket. As the governor ofNsundi, the north-easternmost province, Alfonso had devel- 34 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002 oped close ties with Europeans searching for Prester John. And as the firstborn, he was seen as the only legitimate heirby Portuguese priests, a perception he did much to encour-age. Unlike his father and brothers, who had quickly lostinterest in the mundele 'sreligion because of its stricture against polygamy, Afonso maintained his commitment toChristianity. Accounts of the battle by which he won acces-sion to the throne show how helpful that commitment was.Greatly outmanned, Afonso met his half-brother Mpanzu aKitima outside the capital. A Portuguese priest described whathappened next: Here Dom Afonso, and his handful of men, were ranged against the pagans and his brother; but before the latter hadcome face to face with the king, he was suddenly and entirely routed, and put to flight. . . . Being overcome by fright,Mpanzu rushed headlong into the ambush covered withstakes, which he himself had prepared for the Christians, andthere, almost maddened with pain, the points of the stakesbeing covered with poison, ended his life. Afonso and the early chroniclers tended to ascribe his vic- tory to the Virgin Mary and St. James, \"sent from God to his aid.\" But the presence of Portuguese guns and cavalry in the ranks probably didn 't hurt Afonso, either. (In other accounts, Afonso had his brother put to death after the battle was won.) Once in power, Afonso borrowed aggressively from Europe. He sent his sons to be educated in Portugal. One was Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 35In this sixteenth century drawing a Portuguese captain kneels before King Afonso, whose African subjects prostrate themselves o n the ground. consecrated Bishop of Uttica by Pope Leo X \u2014Africa 's first and only bishop for 400 years \u2014and another became a professor of humanities at the University of Lisbon. Afonso himselfseems to have studied everything. After reading five thickvolumes of Portuguese law lent to him by a certain Balthasarde Castro, he quipped: \"Castro, what is the punishment, in Portugal, for those whose feet touch the ground? \" Afonso established schools in Mbanza Kongo and in the provincialcapitals and sent the sons of hundreds of nobles to them. Toprevent the boys from sneaking away during their lessons, hebuilt high wooden fences around the schools. In 1526, hewrote to the king of Portugal asking for more grammarians. Though he never wavered in his profession of faith, Afonso seems to have used Christianity like one of those fore-ground-background pictures that let you see two figures inprofile or, alternatively, a vase. To missionaries, he appeared adevout Catholic; to Kongo, the beneficiary of a powerful newcult. He cleared the ancient thickets where the graves of theancestors lay, and on them built churches. He called the newchurches mbila , meaning tombs. He appointed the tradi- tional high priest of the water dimension to be in charge ofthe maintenance of the churches and the provision of holywater for baptismal rites. The priest, who had initiallyopposed Christianity, became an ally. Afonso took the tradi-tional domain of witchcraft, with its concern for worldly suc-cess, and onto it grafted Catholicism \u2014a religion whose prayers and relics were understood as European spells andfetish objects. Then he gave the new cult prominence as hisown personal spiritual realm and used it to legitimize his rule.Soon there were kingly cults, with their respective (Catholic)churches, in \"every lordship and province \" in the land. He destroyed the fetishes of his opponents, and though he pre-sented himself to Europeans as a \"married Christian monarch, \" he contrived to leave behind 300 grandchildren. In 1507, a year after seizing power, Afonso sent to Portugal a shipload of copper and ivory. By 1511, however, he wasalready complaining of the behavior of certain Europeans liv-ing in his realm. In the first of 22 surviving letters betweenAfonso and successive Portuguese kings, he asked Manuel \u2014 the Portuguese king \u2014to send an ambassador to the Kongo capable of restraining them. In 1512, responding in a lengthy regimento (a sort of protocol), Manuel specified the kinds of military, technical, and religious assistance Portugal was pre-pared to give Afonso. Accompanying the missive were anambassador and a contingent of priests, soldiers, and techni-cians. The regimento asked about the prospects for acquiring slaves: \"This expedition has cost us much, \" it concluded; \"it would be unreasonable to send it home with empty hands. \" There were, in fact, few slaves available for purchase in theKongo, but Afonso raided a neighboring kingdom after a bor-der skirmish and acquired 600 prisoners. These slave captainsprobably sold to the plantation owners of Sao Tome and tothe king of Akan, in West Africa, whose realm at that timeproduced roughly 10 percent of the world 's annual gold out- put. (In the early 1500s, gold and sugar were, pound forpound, nearly equally valuable.) Soon thereafter, settlers on the tiny island of Sao Tome, apparently impatient with the trickle of slaves Afonso waswilling or able to export, opened their own slave depots at themouth of the Congo River. Under Kongo law, only criminalsand prisoners of war could be sold as slaves, so the Tomistas, many of whom were themselves exiled Portuguese criminals, bribed chiefs, encouraged crime, incited rebellions, and insti-gated wars. They also blackballed priests, killed messengers,refused to ship Afonso 's other products (chiefly copper and ivory), defied the Portuguese king, and, along the way, intro-duced Africans to venereal disease. In 1515, Afonso wrote toManuel asking that he be allowed to take over the island. In1517, he asked to purchase a boat, so that he could at leasttrade with the Portuguese without interference from the Tomistas . \"Most powerful and high prince and king my brother, it is due to the need of several things for the churchthat I am importuning you, \" wrote Afonso. \"And this I prob- ably would not do if I had a ship, since having it I would sendfor them at my own cost. \" In 1526, he wrote to Manuel 's suc- cessor, King Joao III: The excessive freedom given by your factors and officials to the men and merchants who are allowed to come to thisKingdom . . . is such . . . that many of our vassals, whom wehad in obedience, do not comply. We cannot reckon howgreat the damage is, since the above-mentioned merchantsdaily seize our subjects. . . . Thieves and men of evil consciencetake them because they wish to possess the things and waresof this Kingdom. . . . They grab them and cause them to besold; and so great, Sir, is their corruption and licentiousnessthat our country is being utterly depopulated . . . to avoid this,we need from your Kingdoms no other than priests and peo-ple to teach in schools, and no other goods but wine and flourfor the holy sacrament; that is why we beg your Highness tohelp and assist us in this matter, commanding the factors thatthey should send here neither merchants nor wares, becauseit is our will that in these kingdoms there should not be anytrade in slaves nor market for slaves. When this letter went unanswered Afonso tried to block the slave trade himself, but this was impractical and maybeimpossible. The Kongo king 's power derived from being the apex of the trading system. \"If Afonso [had] ejected the Por- tuguese traders, \" writes the historian Anne Hilton, \"the trib- utary governors would certainly have welcomed them andhastened the disintegration of the state. \" Instead, Afonso established a commission of three royal officials to examinethe slaves and determine whether they were \"truly war cap- tives or kidnapped free men. \" The commission had little effect. Afonso continued to complain of the \"inordinate covetousness \" the slave trade had induced in his kingdom, spoke of slavery as \"that great evil, \" and protested that \"under cover of night \" nobles and freemen were still being stolen from their homes. And in a letter Afonso wrote toaccompany five of his nephews and a grandson on theirjourney to Portugal, he wrote: 36 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002 We beg of Your Highness to give them shelter and boarding and to treat them in accordance with their rank, as relatives of ourswith the same blood . . . and if we are reminding you of this andbegging of your attention it is because . . . we sent from this King-dom to . . more thantwenty youngsters, our grandsons, nephews and relations whowere the most gifted to learn the service of God . . . The abovementioned Antonio Veira left some of these youngsters in theland of Panzamlumbo, our enemy, and it gave us great troublelater to recover them; and only ten of these youngsters weretaken to your Kingdom. But about them we do not know so farwhether they are alive or dead, nor what happened to them, sothat we have nothing to say to their fathers and mothers. Joao replied in 1529. He opened on a solicitous note. Did Afonso no longer want to trade with Portugal? If that was hiswish, so be it. But he should know that to refuse to engage intrade was \"contrary to the customs of all nations. \" Here Joao plunged his knife: \"It would be no honor to Afonso or to his kingdom . . . if it were said that the Kongo had nothing totrade and it were visited by only one ship per year. Whatglory, on the other hand, attended a kingdom capable ofexporting 10,000 slaves annually! \" Twisting the knife, Joao concluded, \"If one of your nobles were to revolt against you, rich with merchandise from Portugal, what then wouldbecome of your glory and your power? \" Given the immensity of what followed \u20149 to 11 million Africans shipped to the New World in the next three centuries,millions more dead from wars fomented to secure slaves orfrom the horrors of the middle passage, an enduring legacy ofhatred and grief \u2014a novelist might be tempted to portray Afonso in the labyrinth of his palace, weighing the imponder-able future of his kingdom against a trade whose sorrows hehimself had experienced. Unfortunately, all we know for sureis that by the late 1520s, a thriving slave trade had evolved atMalebo Pool in the northeastern corner of the Kongo, and thatthis was a trade Afonso could \u2014and did \u2014profit from. For one thing, the slaves came from distant lands, so that the Kongowere themselves no longer subject to the depredations of theslavers. For another, the route the caravans took on their wayto the slave ships passed through the capital, allowing Afonsoto tax and regulate the trade. By the 1530s, 4,000 to 5,000slaves were leaving Kongo shores each year, and the MilkyWay, which traced the axis of their movement, was nick-named Nzila Bazombo \u2014the Road of the Slavers \u2014for the men who drove them to the coast. In 1540, Affonso could boast toJoao of his kingdom 's importance to the transatlantic trade: \"Put all the Guinea countries on one side and only Kongo on the other and you will find that Kongo renders more than allthe others put together . . . no king in all these parts esteemsPortuguese goods so much or treats the Portuguese so well aswe do. We favor their trade, sustain it, and open markets androads to Mpumbu where the slaves are traded. \" After reading Afonso 's eloquent and well-tempered letters protesting the trade, it is, of course, dismaying to come acrossa letter like this one. The transatlantic slave trade was so man-ifestly cruel that one wants to believe that from the start there was abundant resistance to it. This much can be said forAfonso: in an era in which slavery was universally accepted,he did everything in his power to see that his own peoplewere safe; he resisted Portuguese slavers for 20 years, and onlycooperated with them when he was faced with the prospectof his country 's imminent collapse; in dire circumstances he managed not only to ensure his nation 's survival, but saw to its prosperity. There is, as well, some evidence that Afonsomay never have been as cooperative as the slavers would haveliked, even after he had established the slave markets. In1539, for example, eight Portuguese, led by a priest, burstinto the cathedral where Afonso was attending High Mass (itwas Easter Sunday) and sprayed the chancel with musket fire. Ultimately, however, a letter like the one of 1540 shows how sentimental it may be to imagine that Afonso felt anyqualms about the trade itself. Few nations made out better than the Kongo in the early years of slavery. \"Through his monopoly on European products, \" writes Hilton, \"Afonso was able to draw many of the neighboring groups into tribute andto create a greater Kongo which far exceeded the nuclear king-dom of the late 15th century and which added to his wealth,prestige, and power. \" By the late 1520s, the kingdoms of Ngola a Kiluanje in the south and Matamba in the southeasthad sent tribute. In the next decade, several states north of theZaire, including a prime copper-producing region, had alsosent presents, and so had groups from the eastern plateau andthe southern mountains. By the time Afonso died, sometimein the early 1540s, the Kongo was one of the most powerfulkingdoms in Africa, its people among the wealthiest, and itsposition seemingly unassailable. It would not be so for long. In 1568, a mysterious ethnic group from Central Africa attacked the Kongo, and like barbarians at the gates of Rome,laid waste to the countryside and sacked the capital. Theyattacked with such speed that the king of Kongo had hardlyany warning of the invasion or time to raise his troops. Thecourt, assorted European merchants and missionaries, andthousands of ordinary citizens of Mbanza Kongo fled to anisland on the Congo River, where they suffered from chronichunger and the bubonic plague. For three years, crocodiles Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 37The king 's household, an enclosure a mile and a half around, contained walled paths, palisades, decorated huts, courtyards, and gardens.feasted on the hundreds of dead and dying who were cast into the surrounding waters, and the Kongo king sent oneSOS after another to his royal brother in Portugal. Eventuallya 600-man contingent of Portuguese soldiers arrived via SaoTome, rallied the remnants of the Kongo army, and routedthe invaders. It turned out, comic book style, that the soundof gunfire frightened the \"cannibals \" half to death. The new, post-restoration Kongo resumed its role as a pri- mary exporter of slaves to the New World. But the lesson ofthe Portuguese repulsion of the invaders was clear: Europeansmight not yet be able to invade and occupy African states,but they held the balance of power among them. That lessonwas not lost on the powers emerging on the African scene inthe early 17th century. By now, the trade had grown so lucra-tive that both the Portuguese and the Kongolese found them-selves competing for business. (The volume of the Africanslave trade tripled from 1500 to 1575, and doubled again inthe next quarter century.) French and British pirates, likeAndrew Battell and Sir John Hawkins (who was knighted for his piracy by Queen Elizabeth I), raided the Portuguese cargo ships. The Dutch, nearing their moment of global ascen-dancy, waged war on Portugal in Europe and abroad. Mean-while, kingdoms to the north and south of the Kongoemerged as major slave-producing regions, and innumerabletiny ports along the West African coast hung out the slavershingle as well. Most of these places could sell slaves for lessthan the Kongo because slaves elsewhere didn 't have as long a march to arrive at the coastal depots, and weren 't as heav- ily taxed as those that passed through Mbanza Kongo. (Pricesfor slaves varied dramatically over the years, but tended to fallduring the 17th century and rise again in the 18th.) Pushed out of the slave trade, the Kongo staved off decline for a half century by producing cloth that the Portugueseexchanged for slaves up and down the African coast, buteventually lost even this advantage to European and otherAfrican weavers. Gradually, the authority of the Kongo statefrittered away. In 1615, the Portuguese colonized the shell-producing island of Luanda, which for two centuries hadbeen the source of the Kongo 's nzimbu money, and also began importing shells from Brazil and India. In four years,the value of the Kongo currency plummeted by 80 percent.Sensing the Kongo 's weakness, Queen Nzinga of Angola annexed the Kongo 's southern provinces and siphoned offslaves from the interior. By the early 17th century, Angola was furnishing a quota of 12,000 slaves per year, most of themKongolese subjects, to European merchants. In addition, the Portuguese began distributing guns more widely, which altered the balance of power away from thecapital and toward the provinces. The Kongo 's coastal province of Sonyo declared independence, and neighboringstates that had once formed part of the greater Kongo brokefree as well. Battles for succession harrowed the Kongo; eightkings ruled in the period between 1614 and 1641. In 1665, a bitter dispute over mineral rights with the Por- tuguese governor of Luanda, led to a final, disastrous conclu-sion. In a Manifesto of War dated July 13, 1665, the then-Kongolese king, Antonio I, ordered all able-bodied Kongomen to enlist in a fight to protect their \"lands, possessions, women and children, their lives and their liberties. \" Accord- ing to later Portuguese estimates, 100,000 Kongo, 190 mus-ket-bearing mulattos, and 29 Portuguese answered his call.On October 30, Antonio and his troops met the combinedforces of Luanda and Portugal in fields outside Mbwila, a mar-ket town in north-central Luanda. It was drizzling and Anto-nio hoped the rain would dampen the Portuguese guns. It didnot. The Kongo lost 5,000 men, including Antonio, his twosons and two nephews, four of the seven governors, variouscourt officials, 95 title holders, and 400 other nobles. Por-tuguese losses were minimal. The Kingdom of Kongo never recovered. It splintered into hundreds of competing chieftainships, all led by infantes claiming descent from Afonso I, all variously coop- erative or mercenary, and all dependent on the slave tradefor their survival. Soon there seemed to be a slave factory inevery village in the land, and the trade fed, and fed off of, acivil war that verged on complete anarchy. Over the years,visitors to the capital Mbanza Kongo reported that the pop-ulation there varied from 100 to 5,000 people, dependingon the transitory success of the local chief in reviving theidea of the kingdom. But as a legitimate, viable politicalentity, the Kongo died in 1665. Or perhaps it is more accurate to say that the Kongo, no longer a state on a map, became, as it had been before Cao,wholly a place of the imagination. Once, Africa was a landof a million strange shadows, known only by the storiestravelers overheard in distant marketplaces and repeated intallow-lit taverns far from home. Citied and peopled bycountless Scheherazades, the continent the medieval car-tographers drew recalls a time when the words \"wondrous \" and \"awful \" were synonymous: on the ancient maps, the places labeled terra incognita were never blank, but popu- lated residences of the imagination. The explorers who plot-ted the continent 's profile and sounded its coastlines expected to be astonished, and were. Imagine what a giraffe,or an elephant, or a manatee looked like to the first Euro-peans to see them. Imagine Bartolomeu Dias rounding theCape of Good Hope and seeing the African coast stretchnorthward \u2014after traveling 5,000 miles in a ship no larger than the average American house. Imagine feeling the 38 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002\"It is our will that in these kingdoms there should not be any trade in slaves nor market for slaves. \" warmth of the Indian Ocean, and seeing the dhows of Mombassa and Zanzibar that even then had sailed as far asIndia. But behind the explorers came the missionaries andthe slavers (who were often the same person), and with nomore than the usual dose of arrogance and greed they shriv-eled the continent to the size of their hearts. \"Africans being the most lascivious of all human beings, \" wrote one slaver, \"may it not be imagined that the cries they let forth at being torn from their wives, proceed from the dread that they willnever have the opportunity of indulging their passions inthe country to which they are embarking? \" In 1508, when a young black woman arrived in Scotland (off a wrecked pirate ship, possibly), King James IV held andwon a royal joust in honor of \"that ladye with the mekle lip- pis.\" A century later, Shakespeare and Rembrandt gave to their portraits of Africans an intelligence and dignity thatlater centuries would scarcely credit, and dozens of lesserpainters of the Italian and Northern Renaissance sprinkledtheir canvases with images of blacks that were no more or lesscondescending than their image of Europeans. In the 15thand 16th centuries, the pope and the secular kings of Europewelcomed African potentates to their courts, and treatedthem with all the deference due royalty. But slavery needed amyth to sustain and justify it. So in the bedrooms of theBrazilian sugar estates, where oriental drapery wilted frombalustrades in the humid air, and from the lecterns of thecathedrals that the missionaries built, stories took root of theAfrican as a tom-tom player and a devil-worshiper, unciv-ilized savage, a sex-fiend and cheerful submissive. \"The peo- ple of Guinea, \" wrote one German scientist in the 18th cen- tury, \"are more insensible than others towards pain and natural evils, as well as towards injurious and unjust treat-ment. In short, there are none so well adapted to be the slavesof others, and who therefore have been armed with so muchpassive obedience. \" And Thomas Carlyle proclaimed, dizzily, \"Before the West Indies could grow a pumpkin for any Negro, how much European heroism had to spend itself in obscurebattle; to sink, in mortal agony, before the jungles, the putres-cences and waste savageries could become arable, and theDevils in some measure chained up! \" In this ideological transformation the Kingdom of the Kongo played a pivotal role. For it was with the discovery andexploitation of the Kongo, coming hard upon the establish-ment of the Atlantic sugar plantation, that the Europeandemand for slaves was rekindled, and the identification ofslavery and race made explicit. In the century prior to 1482,the number of black slaves taken annually from Africa num-bered, at most, in the hundreds. Most worked in Mediter-ranean Europe as household servants, hospital orderlies,garbage collectors, or in similar menial positions. Color atthat time was no bar to servitude: Greeks, Turks, Russians,Slavs, and Cretans were also enslaved, and most of the veryfirst slaves shipped to Brazil were white. But after 1482, thenumber of slaves coming from Africa rose dramatically. By1550, a Portuguese ditty could sum up Europe 's changing perception of Africa, and of the Kongo in particular:uns aos tratadores. (They sell each other there are many merchantswhose specialty it isto trick and capture themand sell them to the slavers.) Thus the question of who could enslave whom, and under what conditions, which had been a topic of lively debate inthe early years of the European discovery and conquest of theNew World, received a decisive answer. The die was cast: eventoday \u2014some 300 years after the Battle of Mbwila \u2014thriller novels and college bars still borrow the Kongo 's name for its suggestion of the primitive. The old kingdom, its territoryneatly bisected by the border between present-day Angolaand Zaire, continues to exert an atavistic attraction, like anout-of-the-way theater in a once-fashionable neighborhood,where, on sporadic afternoons, the lights darken and thesilent films still run. In the decades and centuries that followed, neither war nor peace would succeed in reuniting the kingdom. And yet,however degraded, the idea of resurrecting the Kongo neverentirely died. In the 1950s, F. Clyde Egerton, a visitor toMbanza Kongo, reported of the former capital: It has completely lost any romantic character it ever had, and is now no more than a straggling village. The walled citieshave disappeared and the eleven churches with them. What isleft of the Cathedral is unimposing, just the chancel arch andsome low remains of chocolate-coloured walls. It is sur-rounded by the unkempt grass which is everywhere to be seenin the dry season; and the graves of the early kings of theCongo, rough, obelisk-like monuments in an untidy church-yard, look unkempt and neglected also. Egerton wrote that he had spoken to an \"old man of nearly seventy who sported a magnificent white mustacheand who called himself Dom Pedro VII, the last king ofCongo, but he was rumoured to be an impostor. \" He lived in an unpretentious house near the ruins of the cathedral.Around the walls of his house hung copies of paintings ofPortuguese royalty. Egerton was shown the \"regalia, \" which he described as a \"royal robe trimmed with white fur, which looked more like rabbit than ermine, a silver crown, a sceptre,and miscellaneous utensils, none of which looked more thana hundred years old. \" The king, who died in 1955, was given a small subsidy by the Portuguese authorities, which he sup-plemented by growing a little coffee and rice. DAVIDLOPES IS A FREELANCE WRITER LIVING IN LAWRENCE , KANSAS . Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 39CROn Election Day 2000 in Florida, in the midst of all the dimpled ballots and hanging chads, ThomasJohnson stayed home. Johnson, the AfricanAmerican director of a Christian residential pro- gram for ex-offenders wanted to vote for George W. Bush, butwas prevented by Florida law from doing so. In 1992, John-son had been convicted of selling cocaine and carrying afirearm without a license in New York. After serving his sen-tence and moving to Florida in 1996, Johnson found that asan ex-felon he was barred from the voting booth. He washardly alone in this situation, as at least 200,000 others inFlorida who had theoretically \"paid their debt to society \" were also frozen out of the electoral process. Nationwide, fourmillion Americans either serving a felony sentence or whohad previously been convicted of a felony were also forced tosit out the election. 1 The laws that kept these citizens home can be traced back to the founding of the nation. In retrospect it is not terriblysurprising that felons were excluded from political participa-tion since the majority of the population was excluded at thetime. With the founding \"fathers \" only having granted the vote to wealthy white male property holders, the excludedpopulation also incorporated women, African Americans,illiterates, and the landless. Thus, political participation inthe new democracy was extended to just 120,000 of the twomillion free Americans (not counting the more than one mil-lion slaves and indentured servants) at the time, about 6 per-cent of the population. 2Except for convicted felons, of course, all these other exclusions have been removed over aperiod of 200 years, and we now look back on those barrierswith a great deal of national embarrassment. The exclusion of felons from the body politic derived from the concept of \"civil death \" that had its origins in medieval Europe. Such a designation meant that a lawbreaker had nolegal status, and also had dishonor and incapacity imposedon his or her descendants. The concept was brought to NorthAmerica by the English in the Colonial period. After the Rev-olution, some of the English common law heritage wasrejected, but the voting disqualifications were maintained bymany states. Two hundred years later, every state but Maineand Vermont (which allow prisoners to vote) has a set of lawsthat restricts the voting rights of felons and former felons.Forty-eight states and the District of Columbia do not permitprison inmates to vote, 32 states disenfranchise felons onparole, and 28 felons on probation. In addition, in 13 statesa felony conviction can result in disenfranchisement, gener-ally for life, even after an offender has completed his or hersentence. Thus, for example, an 18-year-old convicted of aone-time drug sale in Virginia who successfully completes acourt-ordered treatment program and is never arrested againhas permanently lost his voting rights unless he receives a gubernatorial pardon. While the issue of disenfranchise- ment would raise questions aboutdemocratic inclusion at any pointin history, the dramatic escala-tion of the criminal justicesystem in the past 30 yearshas swelled the number ofpersons subject to theseprovisions to unprece-dented levels. Currently, 2 percent of the adult popula-tion cannot vote as a result of a currentor previous felony conviction. Given the vast racial dispari-ties in the criminal justice system it is hardly surprising, butshocking nonetheless, to find that an estimated 13 percent ofAfrican American males are now disenfranchised. The coalescence of disenfranchisement laws and racial exclusion began to be cemented in the post-Reconstructionera following the Civil War. Prior to that not only were blacksin the South obviously unable to vote, but only six Northernstates permitted their participation. But the newly enfran-chised black population in the South was quickly met withresistance from the white establishment. In many states, thistook the form of the poll tax and literacy requirements beingadopted, along with a number of states tailoring their existingdisenfranchisement policies with the specific intent ofexcluding black voters. One scholar describes this as a meas-ure designed to provide \"insurance if courts struck down more blatantly unconstitutional clauses. \" 3 The disenfranchisement laws adopted in a number of southern states were not at all subtle, often requiring the lossof voting rights only for those offenses believed to be com-mitted primarily by blacks. In Mississippi, for example, the1890 constitutional convention called for disenfranchise- 40 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002The Modern-Day Voting Rights Challenge by Marc MauerDisenfranchisement ment for such crimes as burglary, theft, arson, and obtaining money under false pretenses, but not for robbery or murder.4 In the words of a Mississippi Supreme Court decision severalyears later, blacks engaged in crime were \"given rather to furtive offenses than to the robust crimes of the whites. \" 5 Other southern states \u2014Alabama, Louisiana, South Car- olina, and Virginia \u2014followed this pattern as well in their tar- geting of \"furtive offenses. \" The intent of such policy was made clear by the author of the Alabama provision, who\"estimated the crime of wife-beating alone would disqualify sixty percent of the Negroes. \" 6Alabama 's constitution also barred voting for anyone convicted of crimes of \"moral turpi- tude, \" including a variety of misdemeanors. Here, too, the intent and effect were quite obvious, resulting in 10 times asmany blacks as whites being disenfranchised, many for non-prison offenses. 7 These policies were not of fleeting duration. Alabama 's dis- enfranchisement law for offenses of \"moral turpitude \" was in place until 1985 before finally being struck down by theSupreme Court due to its discriminatory intent and impact. 8 And while Mississippi barred many petty offenders fromvoting for decades, it did not disenfranchise rapists and mur- derers until 1968.9 While one might debate whether the intended effect of dis- enfranchisement policies today is to reduce minority votingpower, it is inescapable that this impact could have been pre- dicted as a logical consequence of the nation 's wars on crime and drugs. The five-fold increase in the nation 's inmate pop- ulation since the early 1970s brought about both an absoluteincrease in numbers as well as a disproportionately greaterimpact on persons of color. Much of this was due to theinception of the modern-day war on drugs in the 1980s,whereby the number of persons incarcerated for a drugoffense rose from 45,000 in 1980 to nearly a half milliontoday. Blacks and Latinos now constitute four of every fivedrug offenders in state prison. A considerable body of research documents that these figures are not necessarily a result of greater drug use in minority communities but rather drug policies that have employed a law enforce- ment approach in communities of color and a treatment orientation in white and suburban neighborhoods. 10And the greater the number of minority offenders in the system, the greater the rate of disenfranchisement. At modest rates of disenfranchisement such a policy is one that is clearly of concern to an individual felon but isunlikely to affect electoral outcomes in any significant num-ber of cases. But at the historic levels that have been achieved in recent decades the issue is no longer one of merely aca- demic interest but is likely to be having a profound impact onactual electoral results. Sociologists Christopher Uggen and Jeff Manza have pro- duced a sophisticated model for estimating the number ofdisenfranchised voters in each state and the effect of theirabsence on elections for national office. 11Uggen and Manza assume that felons and former felons would vote at lowerrates than the (already low) national rate but that theywould be more likely to vote Democratic, given that theyare disproportionately minorities (an estimated 38 percentAfrican American) and poor and working-class whites. Evenwith a projected lower turnout they conclude that disen-franchisement policies have affected the outcome of sevenU.S. Senate races from 1970 to 1998, generally in states withclose elections and a substantial number of disenfranchisedvoters. In each case, the Democratic candidate would havewon rather than the Republican victor. Projecting theimpact of these races over time leads them to conclude thatdisenfranchisement prevented Democratic control of theSenate from 1986 to 2000. Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 41of Felons: The exclusion of felons from the body politic derives from the concept of \"civil death\" that had its origins in medieval Europe. \u00a9 James Endicott/Stock Illustration SourceSupporters of felon disenfranchisement contend that regardless of their outcome these policies are important forseveral reasons. One of the significant court decisions, anAlabama case decided in 1884, found that denying the voteto ex-convicts was necessary to preserve the \"purity of the ballot box \" from the \"invasion of corruption \" and that \"this class should be denied a right, the exercise of which mightsometimes hazard the welfare of communities. \" 12 In more recent times, this rationale has been presented within the context of the \"law and order \" political climate, being expressed as a fear that convicted felons would pre-sumably cast their vote in such a way as to weaken lawenforcement institutions. In a significant New York case in1967, Judge Friendly wrote that \"it can scarcely be deemed unreasonable for a state to decide that perpetrators of seriouscrimes shall not take part in electing the legislators who makethe laws, the executives who enforce these, the prosecutorswho must try them for further violations, or the judges whoare to consider their cases. \" 13Or in the words of one modern- day proponent, \"criminal disenfranchisement allows citizens to decide law enforcement issues without the dilution of vot-ers who are deemed . . . to be less trustworthy. \" 14 In other words, ex-felons would presumably vote for poli- cies that help criminals and thwart the legitimate interests ofotherwise law-abiding members of the community. If so, thismight set up a conflict between the principle of democraticinclusion and the need for public safety. But how real a threatis this? Suppose, for example, a group of burglars want toreduce the criminal penalties for burglary. First, they wouldhave to field a candidate (either one of their own or someoneelse who is \"pro-burglar \") to run for state office. They would then have to mount a rather effective campaign in this era of\"get tough \" politics in order to secure 51 percent of the vote. Once elected, the new office holder would have to convincea majority of the state legislature and the governor to reducepenalties for burglary. This hardly seems like a substantialthreat to the safety of the community. Perhaps a less fanciful scenario relates to drug policy. As the war on drugs has swelled prison populations and taken adisproportionate toll on minority communities, considerableopposition has developed to mandatory sentencing andrelated policies. In some neighborhoods substantial numbersof people are returning home after serving five-year prisonterms for low-level drug offenses. Arguably, their voices andvotes, along with those of their neighbors, might lead to theelection of candidates who support scaling back harsh druglaws. Is there a policy rationale that justifies excluding per-sons who have experienced the impact of such laws fromdeliberating about their wisdom? The prospect of electoral fraud is also sometimes raised as a legitimate concern in regard to felon voting. While theremight be some validity to this argument for felons convicted of electoral fraud, it is hard to imagine why a car thief or drugseller would have an interest in, or knowledge of, committingsuch an offense. Since more than 99 percent of felons have notbeen convicted of electoral offenses, this seems to be a rather overbroad concern. And when electoral fraud occurs, itrarely manifests itself in the presence of a voter in the votingbooth, but rather through improper counting of ballots oroutright bribery. One does not need to be a registered voter tocommit these offenses. Ironically, in some states electoraloffenses are only classified as misdemeanors and thereforepersons convicted of these crimes are not subject to disen-franchisement. Disenfranchisement is sometimes premised on being a legitimate aspect of punishment for a criminal offense, butthis is curious in several respects. While all other aspects ofsentencing are expected to be proportional to the offenseinvolved and are imposed by a judge on an individual basis,disenfranchisement is an across-the-board penalty imposedon mass murderers and larcenists alike. Further, criminal con-victions do not otherwise result in the loss of basic rights.Convicted felons maintain the right to divorce, own prop-erty, or file lawsuits. The only restrictions generally placed onthese rights are ones that relate to security concerns with aprison. Thus, an inmate may subscribe to Time magazine but not to a publication that describes the production of explo-sive devices. Conflating legitimate punishment objectiveswith the denial of constitutional rights sets a risky precedent. Proponents of disenfranchisement suggest that even in the most extreme cases the loss of the right to vote is nevertruly for a lifetime since all states maintain a process wherebyex-felons can seek restoration of their rights from the gover-nor. While this is true in theory, in practice it is often illusory.A number of states impose a waiting period of 5 or 10 yearsbefore an ex-felon can even petition to have his or her rightsrestored. The process of seeking restoration is also often cum-bersome and expensive. In Alabama, for example, ex-felonsare required to seek a pardon from the Board of Pardons andParoles, but also to provide a DNA sample to the state. 15Yet only four counties are set up to administer DNA testing, so anex-felon might have to travel hundreds of miles to do so. InMississippi, ex-felons must either secure an executive orderfrom the governor or convince a state legislator to introducea bill on his or her behalf, obtain a two-thirds majority in thelegislature, and have it signed by the governor. 16 Data on the number of former felons who have their rights restored are difficult to come by, but in one recent two-year period a total of 404 persons in Virginia regained theirvoting rights at a time when there were more than 200,000ex-felons in the state. 17The state of Florida had previously instituted a procedure whereby the Department of Correc- 42 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002 Disenfranchisement policies are in sharp conflict with the goal of promoting public safety.tions was required to aid released inmates in regaining their voting rights, and as many as 15,000 former felons a yearwere able to do so in the mid-1980s. But new rules imposedby the state in the early 1990s greatly restrict the number ofeligible inmates, with the result that fewer than 1,000 personsa year have their rights restored. Those who are not eligiblestill have the option of applying for executive clemency, butthis process involves completing a 12-page questionnaire thatasks about such items as the details of a spouse 's previous marriage, existing disabilities, amount of stocks and bondsowned, and a description of \"your relationship with your family. \" 18 While the rationale in favor of disenfranchisement is hardly compelling, there are two primary arguments whichsuggest that these laws are both counterproductive and out ofline with evolving international norms. First, disenfranchise-ment policies are in sharp conflict with the goal of promotingpublic safety. Whether an offender has been sentenced toprison, probation, or some other status, a primary goal of thecriminal justice system and the community should be toreduce the likelihood that the person will reoffend. Onemeans by which this can be accomplished is through instill-ing within the offender a sense of obligation and responsibil-ity to the community. Those persons who feel some connec-tion to their fellow citizens are less likely to victimize others.As former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall stated,\"[Ex-offenders] . . . are as much affected by the actions of gov- ernment as any other citizen, and have as much of a right toparticipate in governmental decision-making. Furthermore,the denial of a right to vote to such persons is hindrance tothe efforts of society to rehabilitate former felons and convertthem into law-abiding and productive citizens. \" 19 American disenfranchisement policies are also quite extreme by the standards of other industrialized nations. Inno other democracy are convicted offenders who have com-pleted their sentences disenfranchised for life, as is the case inmore than a dozen states. 20Of the handful of nations that restrict voting rights for a period of time after the conclusionof a prison term, those such as Finland and New Zealandonly do so for several years and only for electoral offenses orcorruption. A number of nations, including ones as diverse asthe Czech Republic, Denmark, Israel, Japan, and South Africa,permit inmates to vote as well. In recent years, the increased attention devoted to this issue has resulted in a reconsideration of some of the moreextreme policies within the states. In 2000, the governor ofDelaware signed into law a measure repealing the state 's life- time ban on ex-felon voting (imposing a five-year waitingperiod in its place), and the following year New Mexico didaway with its lifetime ban as well. Connecticut went further,extending voting privileges to felons currently on probationas well. And in August 2001, the bipartisan National Com-mission on Federal Election Reform co-chaired by formerPresidents Ford and Carter recommended that states allow forthe restoration of voting rights for felons who have com-pleted their sentence. In the wake of the national discussiongenerated over electoral problems and reforms, the nation is likely to see a renewed focus on this area of public policy inthe coming years. The irony of the combined impact of American disenfran- chisement policies along with the massive expansion of theprison system is that a half century after the beginnings of thecivil rights movement increasing numbers of African Ameri-cans and others are losing their voting rights each day. As theWestern democracy with the lowest rate of voter participation,it is long past time for the United States to consider means ofbringing more Americans into the electoral process and endthe practice of excluding large groups of citizens.

Two and a half million people use wheelchairs,110,000 are blind and have no light perception, 1.7million are legally blind, and 11 million people use sign language as their primary means of communication.These are visible disabilities. However, it is important to know that most disabilities are \"invisible. \" Less visible are disabilities caused by epilepsy, dia- betes, hypertension, heart disease, traumatic brain injury,mental retardation, AIDS, some forms of multiple sclerosis,psychiatric disabilities, and cancer. Voting Registration and People with Disabilities For a number of reasons, people who are disabled vote at a 10-20 percent lower rate that nondisabled voters. In fact, if people with disabilities voted at the same rate as those with-out disabilities, 4.6 million more votes would have been castin the last presidential election. 1 Poor voter turnout by Americans with disabilities is partly a result of low voter registration rates. There are approxi-mately 27 million people with disabilities who did not votein the 2000 presidential election; more than 10 million arenot even registered to vote. 2In fact, people with disabilities register to vote at a rate that is 16 percent lower than able-bodied Americans. 3 The National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), known as the Motor Voter Law, requires state agencies that provide servicesto persons with disabilities to offer voter registration to theirclients \"with each application for such services or assistance, and with each recertification, renewal or change of addressform. \" 4A National Organization on Disability/Louis Harris poll reports that only 58 percent of people with disabilities havebeen offered the opportunity to register to vote by their serviceproviders, indicating widespread violation of the NVRA. 5 Agencies required to offer this service include Paratransit providers. Paratransit is a public transportation system thatoffers curb-to-curb or door-to-door transportation for peoplewith disabilities. Approximately one million people with dis-abilities nationwide receive Paratransit rides, and at least400,000 of these individuals are not registered to vote.Recently, a district court in Pennsylvania ruled that the NVRArequires state-funded Paratransit agencies to provide voterregistration opportunities to their clients. 6Plaintiffs in the case requested that the court make a declaration that the stateviolated the NVRA by failing to designate its transportationauthorities as voter registration agencies. A Question of Access One of the reasons people with disabilities, especially those in wheelchairs, do not vote is because of difficulty accessingpolling places. A Rutgers University poll reports that 27 per- cent of nonvoting people with disabilities expect to haveaccess problems at the polls. A General Accounting Office(GAO) report states that 84 percent of all polling places havesome sort of barrier to voters with mobility disabilities. 7Gary Bartlett, the executive secretary-director of the State Board ofElections in North Carolina, recently surveyed the pollingplaces in one of his counties. He found that 20 percent of thatcounty 's polling places had been classified incorrectly as accessible. Rhode Island is the only state in the country tomake all its polling places wheelchair accessible. Over the past few years, the disability community and election officials have been meeting to address these ballotaccess problems. The National Task Force on Election Acces-sibility published in 2000 a polling place access guide that isavailable on the American Association of People with Dis-abilities (AAPD) Web site, www.aapd-dc.org. This guide hasbeen mailed by the Federal Election Commission to everyelection official in the country. On the other hand, some states are making changes because the courts are forcing them to do so. On February 8, 2000,Judge Howard G. Munson of the Northern District of New Yorkgranted an injunction by that state 's attorney general requiring that Schoharie and Delaware counties modify their pollingplaces to comply with the New York State Election Law and theAmericans with Disabilities Act prior to New York 's presidential primaries. The lengthy and detailed decision rejected each ofthe counties ' arguments, including that the attorney general 's demands were unnecessary and \"overly bureaucratic. \" 8Law- suits have also been filed against Philadelphia and Jacksonville,Florida. In August 2002, a settlement was reached in a suitagainst the District of Columbia, requiring accessibility forblind and mobility-impaired voters. 9 In addition to the problem of physical access to the polling place, millions of disabled Americans are denied theright to cast a secret ballot. This includes voters who are blind 44 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002The Sleeping Giant of American Politics by Jim DicksonPeople with Disabilities:and low vision, as well as those who have limited hand mobility. However, technology does exist that enables thesevoters to cast a secret ballot on a \"talking voting system. \" The voter hears the ballot and follows the prompts in thesame manner as when a customer calls his bank or utilitycompany, only in this case the computer is reading thenames of candidates for office. Maryland and Georgia requireone such accessible voting machine in every polling place,and the city of Houston has already used such a system intwo elections. There are five manufacturers of accessible vot-ing equipment. These are listed on the AAPD Web site. Closing the voter registration gap and making polling places accessible are just the start to increasing the voter turnout ofpeople with disabilities. These two agendas, while important,must be supplemented with nonpartisan voter education andget-out-the-vote drives. Disability service providers must pro-mote the importance of voting to all of their clients. Localcoalitions and disability advocates, assisted by national andstate disability organizations, can help achieve this goalthrough multiple mailings and phone banking. To increase the discussion of voting among disability serv- ice providers, the National Organization on Disability andthe League of Women Voters have published a nonpartisan,get-out-the-disabled-vote manual. This comprehensive man-ual, also available on the AAPD Web site, contains detailedinformation and instructions for disability service providers. Exercising the right to vote as full and equal participants in the democratic process is of great importance to all citizenswith disabilities. The American Association of People with Dis-abilities ' Disability Vote Project seeks to showcase the impor- tance of voting within the disability community. As the dis-ability community establishes itself as a powerful voting bloc, Americans will be all the more ready to accept and encourageall that people with disabilities have to offer the nation.

CRAFP PHOTO/ Manny CENETA \u00a9 AFP/CORBISDiversity Today It's every CEO 's worst nightmare. He 's packing his brief- case for the evening when he gets a panicky call fromhis public relations firm. There 's a story set to appear in tomorrow 's Wall Street Journal : A class action suit is going to be filed against the company alleging pervasive racial dis-crimination. The lawyer spearheading the case has wonmulti-million dollar lawsuits against several Fortune 500firms. Worse, there are rumors that a major civil rights figuremay be launching a boycott against the company, damagingits reputation in ways that will take years to undo. Then a call comes in from the VP in finance: The com- pany 's shares in early evening off-hours trading have dropped by three points, and are falling fast. Oh, and there 's probably nothing to this \u2014the VP 's voice drops to a whis- per\u2014but has he heard anything about an incriminating audio tape? Something about racist language at a recentexecutive staff meeting? Still consulting with finance, the CEO is interrupted by the persistent beep of call waiting. It 's the New York Times . The questions come fast \u2014faster than he can answer them. Any response to the lawsuit? Was he aware of the racial ten-sion at his Decatur, Illinois, plant? How many senior VPs inthe firm are African American? Just the one? Out of howmany? Nothing quite this dramatic, of course, has ever occurred to any real company. Even when disaster strikes, it 's usually spread out over a period of weeks or months. Still, if thetimeline has been condensed for dramatic effect, the inci-dents it describes are real enough, as any reader of the busi-ness pages will recognize. The $132 million dollar settlementat Shoney 's is dwarfed by the $176 million settlement at Tex- aco, which in turn is trumped by the $192 million settle-ment at Coca Cola. Small wonder that diversity and anti-sex-ual harassment training have mushroomed into a billiondollar business, or that company chieftains woo civil rightsleaders today as assiduously as they romance Congress. As companies scramble to avoid lawsuits, however, they're discovering something surprising: Diversity, it turns out, can be good for them. \"How well an enterprise works \u2014how productive it is in a highly competitive global econ- omy\u2014depends on whether it has people who are comfort- able working across lines of race, class, religion, and back-ground, \" say former Ivy League university presidents Derek Bok and William Bowen. \"Diversity is a business imperative because it affects competitiveness. \" This article takes that proposition as its theme. In a nation that is becoming increasingly multiethnic, and in a worldthat is ever more interconnected, diversity has become aninescapable business reality. Managed well, diversity can bea source of competitive advantage; managed poorly (or sim-ply left to its own devices), a source of frustration, resent-ment, and yes, even disaster. Business can 't be given the task of reforming society or of righting the nation 's historical wrongs. That is a task for everyone \u2014individually and collectively. But business can make sure that the doors of opportunity are held open to all.If there is one consistent message to be gleaned from theexisting research and from the experience of countless cor-porations, it is that responding proactively to diversity is notonly the right thing to do, it 's also the smartest. As Jocelyn Roberts, a human resources manager for a DC-based tech-nology company, noted, \"We view diversity as something more than a moral imperative or a business necessity. We seeit as a business opportunity. \" The Demographic Revolution The challenge of the 20th century, the great African Ameri- can scholar W. E. B. DuBois wrote prophetically in 1903,would be the problem of race. For American business leaders,the challenge of the 21st century may also prove to be race \u2014 as well as ethnicity, gender, age, religion, disability status,and sexual orientation, to list just a few of the many waysthat Americans now define and distinguish themselves. To understand why race \u2014and, increasingly, these other dimensions of personal identity \u2014continue to be so salient, consider the demographic changes now underway. In 1900,fully 87 percent of people living in the United States werewhite; most of those who weren 't white were African Amer- icans living in the Deep South. By 1950, those percentages 46 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002Managing theDiversityhadn 't changed much, although large numbers of blacks were migrating north in search of better opportunities in theindustrializing cities. Today, however, less than 75 percent ofAmericans are non-Hispanic whites. There are just as manyHispanics as blacks, and growing populations of Asian andMiddle Eastern Americans. By 2050, there will be nearlytwice as many Hispanics as African Americans, and \u2014in absolute numbers \u2014more Asian Americans than there are African Americans today. By the middle of this century, non-Hispanic whites will no longer be a majority of the popula-tion. In other words, we will all be minorities . No nation in history has experienced such a swift \u2014 indeed, such a revolutionary \u2014change in its demographiccomposition. Yet it is a revolution that almost never makes the headlines. Like the frog that doesn 't notice that the water in the pot is heating up, we rarely grapple with the true sig-nificance of all the incremental changes taking place. Theincreasing number of fashionable Asian restaurants in ourcities, the proliferation of Latino entertainers on our TVs;these are mere hints of something much deeper and vasterhappening below the surface. The United States, as thewriter Farai Chideya has argued, is making the transitionfrom being a majority-white nation concerned with blackand white issues, to a majority-minority nation insuffi-ciently aware of \u2014and insufficiently prepared for \u2014its emerg- ing multicultural identity. Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 47 Best Practices for 21st Century Business by David AronsonRevolutionArtvilleBusinesses, of course, have a particular interest in deal- ing with the practical realities of this change \u2014if they don't want to end up like the proverbial frog. Indeed, the changes are even more dramatic at the business level.Because immigration skews a population young, the laborforce of today and tomorrow will be even more diversethan the population at large. In addition, race and ethnicity are now just part of the \"diversity equation. \" The civil rights movement gave rise to a host of other groups seeking recognition, furthercomplicating the picture. Women, religious minorities,the disabled, gays and lesbians \u2014these are just a few of the groups that have given such a kaleidoscopic quality totoday 's political and social landscape. Today, only 29 per- cent of families composed of a married couple with chil-dren live in a traditional two-parent household with astay-at-home mom and a working dad. Especially whenAmericans not living in such an arrangement are takeninto account, it is clear the nation is a long way from theera of Father Knows Best . Ted Childs, vice president for workforce diversity at Inter- national Business Machines (IBM), points out another rea-son diversity is key: There are more than 12 million women-and minority-owned businesses in the United States, trans-acting more than $1.4 trillion in business each year. The per-centage of women- and minority-owned firms has morethan doubled in the past decade. The number of Hispanic-owned businesses alone jumped from 400,000 to 2 millionbetween 1986 and 1996. And Asian Americans havefounded more than 600,000 new businesses over the pasttwo decades. Today, Childs points out, there are more than83 million people of color in the United States, who, com-bined, have an income or spending power equivalent to theGNP of such mid-size nations as France, the U.K., or Spain.\"White men in America only have so much money, \" Childssays. \"If you measure a business by how it grows, you have to focus on people of color and the elderly. They are thenation 's fastest growing demographics. \" For Maria Johnson, vice president, Office of Diversity, Health, and Worklife Initiative, at Fannie Mae, diversity isalso a bottom-line issue. Fannie Mae specializes in the sec-ondary mortgage market; the company has an interest inseeing as many people own homes as possible. FannieMae's analyses suggest that the housing saturation gap \u2014 the difference between the number of people who owntheir own homes and the number who could \u2014is much higher for various minority groups than it is for whites.\"We estimate that at any moment, about 75 percent of whites could own their homes, and about 70 percent do.The saturation gap is only about 5 percentage points. Forsome minority groups, such as Hispanics, the gap is morelike 20 points, so every dollar invested [in encouragingthem to buy homes] yields higher returns. \" Much of the early impetus behind the diversity move- ment in corporate America came from the Hudson Insti-tute's 1980 report, Workforce 2000 . That report made head- lines by predicting that by the year 2000, only 15 percentof entrants to the workforce would be white males. As itturns out, that statistic wasn 't quite accurate, or to put it more charitably, wasn 't quite understood accurately. The 15 percent referred to net new entrants, a figure that rep-resents the number of those who are entering minus thosewho are retiring for each group, expressed as a percentageof the total. 1There has been something of a backlash as a result of this misunderstanding, with several analysts con-tending that the significance of diversity has been exag-gerated. It is important therefore, to speak clearly andaccurately. Between 1998 and 2008, about 42 million peo-ple will have entered the workforce. Forty-one percent willbe ethnic/racial minorities. Around 29 percent will be 48 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002 Figure 1.

Based on 1990 Census data with a projection of moderate immigration growth.white women. And slightly more than that \u2014roughly 30 percent \u2014will be white men (see figure 2). If this is far from the 15 percent cited in the headlines, it is still an extraor-dinary change from say, 1940, when white men consti-tuted 69 percent of the workforce. The changes are even more striking considering the other factors in effect. Fifty years ago, whites and blacks may haveboth worked in an office building, but chances are that thewhite worked as, say, a lawyer, and the black as a janitor.Today 's workplace, while still imperfect, is far more inte- grated. Indeed, sociologists tell us that work remains the onerelatively integrated setting left: There is, they say, a worry-ing trend toward resegregation in our neighborhoods,schools, civic associations, and so on. In addition, the nature of work is changing. The factory worker stamping rivets on an assembly line circa 1930 mayhave worked side-by-side with the fellow cranking the boiler,but they didn 't need to work together in the way that, say, a Web designer has to work with the marketing crew andsimultaneously coordinate with the technical experts. It 's difficult to quantify the extent of this change, but the new,post-industrial economy clearly puts a premium on team-based, knowledge-driven production. Finally, globalization is affecting us all, propelling immi- grants to new lands, knitting together ever-richer informa-tion networks, and releasing capital across borders, like waterseeking level. These processes will fundamentally alter thenature of the corporation itself. As management guru PeterDrucker has said: \"It is still generally assumed that the domestic economy, as defined by national boundaries, is theecology of enterprise and management. . . . But in today 's transnational [environment], the country is only a 'cost cen- ter.' Management and national boundaries are no longer congruent. \" America is becoming, as more than one writer has noted, the world 's first universal nation. In short, the critics of the diversity movement are wrong. Diversity is indeed here to stay, for reasons both domesticand international. Politics, economics, technology, anddemography are all propelling us toward a more interde-pendent, multicultural world. But the fact that it is inevitabledoesn 't make diversity any simpler or easier. In fact, diversity poses a host of new challenges for business leaders. Amongthese challenges: Getting the most out of a multiculturalworkforce; appealing to an increasingly segmented con-sumer market; clearing complex regulatory hurdles; and, notleast, avoiding lawsuits and negative publicity. Hidden Costs and Neglected Opportunities The argument for managing diversity has both positive and negative dimensions. On the negative side, managing diver-sity poorly entails costs. The most spectacular, of course, arethe costs of litigation and negative publicity. It will be yearsbefore Texaco (now ChevronTexaco) lives down one execu-tive's infamous 1994 remark that \"the black jellybeans are always stuck on the bottom. \" Its share price dropped $5 after news of that tape recorded remark surfaced. 2Other negative outcomes, such as turnover and absen- teeism, can be measured and \"priced out, \" and intermediate values can be derived from workplace satisfaction surveys. Aseries of workplace surveys by Innovations Internationalfound that compared to white men, women and people ofcolor were more likely to report that their talents and abili-ties were being significantly underutilized at work: Whitemen on average report 85 percent of their abilities are beingused; white women, 75 percent; and people of color, only 65percent. Simply from a business perspective, the waste ofhuman capital implied by this discrepancy is troubling. One estimate in the early 1990s was that the turnover rate for women was 100 percent higher than for men, and 40percent higher for blacks than whites. In 1988, Mobil foundthat women were leaving the company at rates 2.5 times theaverage for men, after controlling for child bearing. Withthe costs of replacing workers averaging $5,000 -$10,000 for hourly wage earners, and well over $100,000 for senior man-agers, these costs add up quickly. As revealing as these numbers are, they barely scratch the surface of the true costs of poor diversity management,because most of its consequences are difficult if not impossibleto quantify. How to measure the loss of productivity entailedby negative attitudes, inefficiencies arising from intergroupworkplace tensions, and overlooked opportunities? There areopportunity costs, as well. What if Brand X hadn 't foreseen the potential of the Hispanic market, and lost this growingniche to Brand Y? What if 25 percent of women managersweren 't burned out or cynical about their firm 's stated com- mitment to \"family values, \" when it requires them to work 60-hour weeks as an unstated condition of advancement? It is Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 49 Figure 2.

But Is It Good for You? Managing diversity is about more than avoiding negative out- comes. Diversity advocates make a stronger claim: Managedwell, they say, diversity can be a positive force, spurring cre-ativity, dynamism and excellence, renewing and refreshingthe corporation, and ultimately improving the bottom line.Authors have made different arguments in favor of diversity,and five consistently come to the fore: One is the resource-acquisition argument, which states that companies with the best reputations for promoting diversitywill attract the best workers. Why? Because, as their share ofthe labor force increases, more and more of the best workerswill be drawn from the ranks of women and minorities.They 'll naturally prefer an environment known to be friendly to their concerns \u2014as will ever-increasing numbers of whitemen who favor working in progressive, dynamic environ- ments. Or as Ernest Hicks, manager of corporate diversity andcollege partnerships at Xerox, says, \"People don 't go to work for companies that have bad reputations for diversity. \" Another is the resource-maximization argument, which states that a firm gains a competitive edge if it is able to hire,retain, and promote top performers, regardless of theirracial/gender status. Overcoming the factors that unduly limitemployees ' potential liberates talent that may have been stymied or gone under-utilized. The goal, says Carl Brooks,president of the Executive Leadership Council, a group of sen-ior African American executives, \"is to create an environment where everyone feels an opportunity to be discovered and uti-lized to their capacity. \" A third argument is creative problem solving. This claim relies on the common-sense notion that the more perspectivesthat can be brought to bear on a problem, the more and bet-ter solutions you are likely to generate. Other research suggeststhat exposure to diversity helps individuals develop morecomplex understandings of the world, leading to more pro- 50 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002One person with a particularly upclose view of developments inthe field is Carl Brooks, president of the Executive Leadership Council. The ELCis an organization of 250 senior-levelAfrican American executives and entrepre-neurs. \"Progress is slower than we had anticipated, \" he admits. \"The big issue is not outright racism, it 's breaking into the club. We 're accepted as senior partners, but with a few exceptions haven 't yet made that transition to top-level board membersand CEOs. \" The view that the situation hasn 't changed as much as it could have appearsto be confirmed by the statistics regardingworkplace discrimination. Indeed, fromthe frequency of the headlines aboutworkplace lawsuits and the steadilymounting sums awarded as a result ofEqual Employment Opportunity Commis-sion (EEOC) complaints, it can seem likethe situation has improved very little. Highly publicized lawsuits at Texaco in 1997 and Coca Cola in 2000 weresettled for $176 milion and $192million, respectively (see table 1). The number of charges filed with the EEOC has grown by 100 percentover the past decade (see figure 1). The average settlement award for an employment practice liability lawsuithas increased fourfold since 1994alone (see figure 2). Six of every 10 corporations have been hit with at least one sexualharassment lawsuit in the past fiveyears, according to the Society forHuman Resource Management, and firms with more than 250 employeesreport an average of six sexual harass-ment complaints a year. Meanwhile, white males continue to predominate at the higher levels of mostcorporate structures. Hispanics, AfricanAmericans, and American Indians aremore likely than whites or Asians to workin lower-paying semi-skilled jobs or asservice workers. They are less likely to holdwhite-collar jobs, and if they do, they aremore likely than whites or Asian PacificAmericans to work as typists, clerks, orsalespeople than as managers or profes- How have minorities fared in corporate America?

In other words, diversity not only spurs work groups to be more creative, but inspiresindividuals to become more creative as well. A fourth argument is the marketing argument, which, sim- ply put, says that successful marketing requires a thoroughand intimate knowledge of the culture you are marketing to.Diversity consultants invariably cite the example of Fordattempting to sell its Nova cars to Hispanics, seeminglyunaware that \"no va \" means \"doesn 't go\" in Spanish. A more recent example is the U.S. Army 's new motto, \"An Army of One,\" which was translated into Spanish as \"Yo soy el army. \" Only advertisers familiar with shades of meaning and theactual speech habits of Hispanic Americans would select theEnglish word \"Army \" over the Spanish \"Ejercito \"\u2014which for many recent immigrants from countries with turbulent pastshas decidedly negative connotations. A fifth argument relates to globalization. It says that the skills, languages, and cultural competencies of Amer-ica's diverse workforce are an invaluable resource in help- ing firms compete abroad. America 's immigrants, forexample, can help forge economic links between the United States and their countries of origin; their bilingualchildren help U.S. multinationals penetrate foreign mar-kets. Diversity Dilemmas A number of conceptual and intellectual dilemmas bedevil the diversity movement. Like vast tectonic plates, theydetermine much of the diversity movement 's topography, its fissures and mountain ranges and occasional volcanic con-troversies, yet remain largely hidden from view. One of them is how to acknowledge and discuss group differences without resorting to stereotypes. One of thenation 's most prominent diversity consultants, for example, has written a whole book about the differences betweengroups. In it, one learns that \"personal style is important in the way African Americans talk, walk, dress, work \u2014in every aspect of life \"; that Asian Americans value modesty and humility; and that \"Latin Americans highly value their emo- Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 51sionals. As of this writing, only two For- tune 500 companies are run by women;only four are led by members of an ethnicminority group. Fully 18 percent of For-tune 500 companies count no womenamong the ranks of their corporate offi-cers; 11 percent have no people of color. That's the bad news. The good news is that great strides have been made overthe past few decades. Since 1960, thepercentage of African American workersin managerial or professional positionshas increased sixfold. In the past decadealone, the percentage of black managersor professionals has jumped 6 points,from 16 to 22 percent (see figure 3). Thenumber of black senior executives at For- tune 500 companies has roughly dou-bled, says Brooks. And 89 percent of For-tune 500 companies now have at leastone ethnic minority on board, comparedwith 56 percent in 1990. The gains for women are even more impressive. The percentage of womenmanagers and professionals went from 14to 29 percent over the past decade.Women make up 12.5 percent of corpo-rate officers in Fortune 500 companies, upfrom 8.7 percent in 1995, and the num-ber of Fortune 500 companies with awoman top earner went from 29 to 83(see figure 4). 1It is important to emphasize these improvements, because a constantdrone of bad news can suggest that theproblems are too far-reaching or intract-able to be much affected by anythingbusiness executives do. In fact, there hasbeen a great deal of progress \u2014and more progress is likely, because many ofthe initiatives that began 10 to 20 yearsago are just now bearing fruit in theform of senior, top-level managers andexecutives. 1 Women of color have not been as fortunate: They make up only 1.3 percent of corporate officers, andonly six women of color are top earners. There areinsufficient data on other major ethnic/racial groups. Award MedianAward Mean SOURCE: Jury Verdict Research: Employment Practice Liability, Jury Award Trends and Statistics.Figure 2.

Most definediversity in the broadest possible terms \u2014encompassing, to quote from one diversity manual, \"all the ways that we are human, including our values,perspectives, personalities, and experi-ences. \" The impulse behind these defini- tions is noble: to make sure that every-one feels included \u2014even groups, such as white men, who might feel threat-ened or excluded by diversity initiatives.In practical terms, however, several ele-ments of personal identity usually cometo the fore in diversity initiatives: Race,Ethnicity, Gender, Age, Religion, Disabil-ity, and Sexual orientation (REGARDS).That is because these dimensions of aperson 's identity remain the most socially significant. It is along these linesthat people are most likely to be dis-criminated against \u2014that is, to be treated unfairly because of some irrele-vant group characteristic. And it is alongthese lines that groups have organizedto protest their mistreatment and pro-tect their rights. This section very brieflyexplores the situation and concerns ofeach of the major groups. AFRICAN AMERICANS African Americans remain America 's most visible minority. Throughout our history,they have been the minority group thatdefines what it means to be a minoritygroup in America, and their story isineluctably entwined with the nation 's own struggles to live up to its highestideals. Until very recently, they were alsothe largest minority group in terms ofpopulation. Their political activism, theirachievements in high-profile fields suchas entertainment and sports, and theirrich cultural legacy give them a visibilitythat other minority groups are onlybeginning to approach. (When asked toestimate what percentage of Americansare black, most Americans, black andwhite, guess in the range of 25 -40 per- cent; in fact, only a little more than 11percent of Americans are black.) Less well appreciated is the economic strength of black America. Stereotypesof blacks as poor, criminal, welfare-dependent, lazy, and so on, are not onlywrong, but can lead people to underes- timate the extraordinary potential of thisgroup, considered both as a market andas a workforce: African Americans have the highest buying power of any minoritygroup, at $532 billion per year(1998), up 73 percent since 1990. Almost 50 percent of African Ameri- cans own their own homes. African Americans outpace the gen- eral population in terms of growth inhousehold income, small businesscreation, mortgage origination, andhigher educational attainment. Unfortunately, African Americans con- tinue to face substantial hurdles in corpo-rate America. Many feel they are forced tocontend with unvoiced attitudes, suspi-cions, and stereotypes that they are havingconstantly to overcome. Among theseassumptions: that they are \"affirmative action hires, \" and therefore less deserving than others of their position; that they areless capable or intelligent or hardworking;that at heart they have negative andresentful attitudes. African Americans arealso most likely to report feeling the needto suppress aspects of their personalitiesand identities in order to blend in with thecorporate culture. And they report havingto work harder simply to be given thesame opportunities as others. LATINOS News that Latinos had effectively sur- passed African Americans as the nation 's largest minority group was the biggestheadline to emerge from the 2000 Census.But even before then, Hispanic communi-ties were capturing the attention of mar-keters, advertisers, and politicians. The diverse cultures, traditions, and countries of origin of Hispanic Americansvirtually guarantee that any summary oftheir accomplishments will be incomplete.Their historical experiences run from colo-nization and conquest to immigration andexile. The Hispanic American civil rightsmovement, led by such inspiring leaders asCesar Chavez, helped bring HispanicAmericans into the mainstream of Ameri-can social and political life. With more than30 million inhabitants of the United Statesnow self-identifying as Hispanics, they have come to exert a growing influenceon the cultural and intellectual life of thenation. This influence extends from thepopularity of Latin Beat to the efflores-cence of Hispanic literature. It is an influ-ence that will only continue to grow, asmore than one-quarter of the U.S. popula-tion is expected to be Hispanic by the year2050. Hispanics represent a burgeoningmarket as well as a growing labor force.The total purchasing power of the grouphas more than doubled since 1990, and isnow estimated at $450 billion. More thanone million Hispanics report an annualincome of more than $75,000. Younger,on average, than non-Hispanics, they arealso the most geographically concen-trated, with more than 80 percent residingin just five states: California, Texas, NewYork, Florida, and Michigan. Hispanics facea distinct set of problems. They are, pro-portionately, the least well-represented ofthe major ethnic and racial groups amongthe managerial and professional elite.Indeed, only 1 percent of executives atcorporations having more than 100 work-ers are Hispanic. This statistic partly reflectslanguage and educational barriers.Approximately half of all school-age His-panics are obtaining high school diplomas,compared with nearly 90 percent of blacksand whites. But, say advocates, the dispar-ity also reflects ongoing stereotypes of His-panics as macho, temperamental, andlow-skilled. In addition, some evidencesuggests that Latinos have not been giventhe sustained attention that many firmshave recently paid to African Americans,and that mechanisms for recruiting His-panics (for example, college job fairs) arenot as developed as they could be. ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICANS Although they are the nation 's fastest grow- ing population group, Asian Pacific Ameri-cans are often overlooked. They are themost diverse ethnic/racial group, exceed-ing even Hispanic Americans, since theyencompass Japanese, Indians, Chinese,Korean, Pacific Islander, Filipino, Viet-namese, and other nationalities, each withtheir own language and a complex andoften contentious history of interaction.They range from pre-literate HmongWinter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 53refugees, to highly skilled immigrant Indian software designers, to seventh- and eighth-generation Japanese American World War IIveterans. Considered as a group, AsianAmericans have done well: the averagehousehold income is $6,000 higher thanthat of Caucasians, and $21,000 higherthan that of African Americans. They alsoenjoy the highest educational level of anyracial/ethnic group in the United States.Thirty-eight percent hold bachelor 's degrees versus 22 percent of non-Hispanicwhites, 11 percent of African Americans,and 10 percent of Hispanics. High levels ofentrepreneurial activity have also boostedAsian American incomes. According to theSmall Business Administration, 56 percent,or $275 billion, of all minority business salescome from Asian Americans, comparedwith $184 billion from Hispanics and $59billion from blacks. However, these statistics can mask gross disparities among different Asian PacificAmerican communities and contribute tothe stereotype of Asians as a \"model minority, \" whose hard work, intelligence, and success rebut allegations that discrim-ination and prejudice remain problems inthis country. On the contrary, many AsianPacific Americans report having experi-enced various types of discrimination. Forexample, they are often mistaken for non-citizens and asked where they learnedsuch good English. They are viewed astechnically competent, but lacking ininterpersonal and leadership skills. ManyAsian Pacific Americans continue to expe-rience a \"glass ceiling, \" limiting their mobility into the highest ranks of execu-tive and administration positions. And arecent poll of American attitudes andbeliefs found that a substantial majoritystill subscribe to stereotypical judgmentsabout Chinese Americans \u2014for example, that they are \"clannish. \" AMERICAN INDIANS AND ALASKA NATIVES American Indians/Alaska Natives are per- haps the most invisible minority due totheir relative small size. Comparativelylittle data is collected by mainstream(i.e., non-Native) organizations, so theneeds and characteristics of Native pop-ulations often go unrecognized, particu-larly within the business sector. There are, however, 4.5 million American Indi-ans/Alaska Natives in the United States,making up 1.5 percent of the total pop-ulation. Within that group are widelyvaried cultural and tribal distinctions. Because of their unique circumstances and government relationships, NativeAmericans remain largely clustered and areless integrated with the rest of society thanother racial/ethnic minority groups. It isestimated that 40 percent of AmericanIndians live on reservations; the remaining60 percent live either close to reservationsor farther away in rural communities. Rela-tively few live in urban environments. Themajority of the American Indian/AlaskaNative population resides in the West (43percent) and South (31 percent). AmongAlaska Natives, the vast majority live inremote rural villages, highly segregatedfrom the state 's economic epicenters. An unfortunate history of domination and removal has left a large number ofNative Americans in a situation of poverty and economic depression, with littleopportunity for advancement, particularlyon geographically and socially isolatedreservations. Native tribes and villageshave some of the highest poverty andunemployment rates in the country, at 33and 43 percent, respectively, for those liv-ing on or near reservations. Some reserva-tions, such as Pine Ridge in South Dakota,experience unemployment rates as high as85 percent and poverty rates at more than60 percent. The same destitution is visiblein Alaska Native villages, where one-fifth ofinhabitants live below poverty, and insome, unemployment rates exceed 80percent. Despite federal obligations to tribes and villages, there has been little improvementin economic conditions and opportunitiesover the years. As table 1 indicates, thereare proportionately fewer Native-ownedfirms than are owned by any other group. Table 1.

Corporate attempts to improvediversity should include outreach to andrecruitment of Native populations, particu-larly in saturated regions of the country. WOMEN In 1943, the Office of the Secretary of War issued a pamphlet titled \"You're Going to Employ Women, \" which con- tained the following: \"A woman worker is not a man; in many jobs she is a substi-tute\u2014like plastics instead of metal \u2014she has special characteristics that lend them-selves to new and sometimes much supe-rior uses. \" As the cigarette ad insists, women have come a long way sincethen. Or have they? Although women area majority of the population, and some46 percent of the workforce, they areoften grouped as a minority or \"pro- tected category, \" both in law and in prac- tice. The reason? They continue to besubject to various kinds of job-related dis-crimination, from pay inequities toharassment to \"glass ceiling \" limits on their career. A few examples: A 1995 report found that 95 percent of senior managers in the largestU.S. companies were men. According to a 1996 study, less than 3 percent of federal contracts wentto women. Male physicians earn$1,553 per week, compared with$899 for females; male securitiesand financial professionals earn$1,118 per week, compared with$641 for females. Overall, research groups continue to find large discrepancies inincome by gender, with women earning about 74 cents for everydollar men earn. 1 The proportion of women in the labor force has grown steadily over the past fivedecades, from 29 percent in 1950 to 47percent in 1997. They are expected toreach parity by 2010. And women 's labor participation rate (the percentage ofwomen in the job market) grew from 33percent in 1950 to 61 percent in 2000.Two-thirds of women with children underthe age of 6 now work, up from 47 per-cent as recently as 1980. However, employers are only begin- ning to come to grips with the conse-quences of these trends. The traditionalcareer path, a \"lock-step, full-time march to a one-way, one-time retirement, \" developed during the heyday of the malebreadwinner, remains the norm at mostfirms. But it is, as one demographer hasexpressed it, an \"antiquated career tem- plate. \" Today most working husbands have working wives, and most childrenhave working mothers. Increasingly, firmswill find it advantageous to adapt newand innovative strategies to retainwomen employees, through flex andpart-time schedules \"mommy (or parent- ing)\" tracks, family leave, and telecom- muting, for example. OLDER AMERICANS The graying of the American worker is one of the dominant trends in today 's labor force. The oldest of the babyboomers hit 55 in 2001, and as thisdemographic bulge moves toward therear of the population snake, it will forceemployers to rethink many of theassumptions that they \u2014and society in general \u2014have long operated under. Labor participation rates of the elderlyhave drifted downward for nearly a cen-tury, for example, as Social Security andpensions have provided guaranteedincome. But many boomers will want tocontinue working past the traditionalretirement age, either because they enjoytheir work or because they need theincome. (Few observers expect SocialSecurity and Medicare to remain as gen-erous in the years after 2020 as they aretoday. The benefits that enabled the pasttwo generations of Americans to retire inrelative ease are unlikely to persist, sayexperts, because the proportion of work-ing to elderly adults will shift dramaticallyover the coming decades, from aboutfour-to-one in 1995 to about two-to-onein 2030.) Employers will have to recon-sider retirement planning and benefitprograms. They will also have to figureout how to make room for middle-agedsubordinates who find their opportunitiesfor advancement blocked by the continu-ing presence of senior personnel. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES There are as many as 54 million Ameri- cans with disabilities, including some 17million who are of working age. Of these,some 32 percent, or 5.8 million, are cur-rently employed. Fully 56 percent ofthose who say they are able to work arecurrently working, up from 46 percent in1986. And 72 percent of those whoaren't employed say they would prefer to be working. Four trends are likely toincrease the number of disabled Ameri-cans in the workforce: First, in part because of the aging oftions. \" These generalizations come perilously close to being stereotypes. Is the alternative, then, to pretend that groupdifferences don 't exist? Many diversity experts would say no: It is important, they say, to recognize that groups differ alongimportant lines, and to respect and value those differences.But what precisely do those differences consist of? Here,angels fear to tread, and even most consultants turn mute.So what is the confused manager to do?The answer, it would seem, is to be alert to the potential for differences without presuming them of any particular indi-vidual. Say, for example, you 're chairing a meeting discussing prospective job candidates with several colleagues you don 't know particularly well. One, a Midwesterner of Norwegiandescent, speaks favorably of a certain candidate, but withoutany real emotional emphasis. There are at least three possiblereadings: 1) your colleague likes the candidate, but doesn 't 54 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002America, there are ever-larger num- bers of people with disabilities. Second, new technology \u2014every- thing from sophisticated speechrecognition software to roboticallyenhanced wheelchairs \u2014is making it possible for many of those with dis-abilities to lead more productivelives. Third, there is a greater public awareness of the potential of thisgroup of employees, in part becauseof the public education activities ofsuch advocacy groups as theNational Organization on Disabilityand the Department of Labor 's Office of Disability Employment Policy. Fourth, new laws, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act andthe many state variants this 1990federal law inspired, have given dis-abled Americans opportunities theymay have been denied earlier. 2 All of this is good news not only for disabled Americans, but for theiremployers as well. Because they are gen-uinely grateful for the opportunity,employees with disabilities in the work-place are more reliable, more depend-able, more punctual, and more loyalemployees than their non-disabled coun-terparts, according to the Office of Dis-ability Employment Policy, which collectsdata and empirical evidence. 3Further- more, most of the changes necessary toaccommodate disabled Americans costbusinesses very little. One detailed analy-sis of a major retail store found that thetotal cost of all changes amounted to$45 per accommodated worker. Businessis also waking up to the market potentialof this group. Collectively, people with disabilities possess a disposable annualincome of more than $175 billion. Addthe incomes of household family mem-bers, and that number is more than a tril-lion dollars. A 1994 study conducted byNational Family Opinion, Inc., for the1996 Paralympic Games showed thatpeople with disabilities are more likely topurchase goods and services from com-panies that are \"disability friendly. \" GAYS AND LESBIANS It is difficult to estimate the economic strength of gays and lesbians, in partbecause no one really knows what per-centage of Americans are actually gay andlesbian. Estimates range from 2 or 3 per-cent to upwards of 10 percent. Althoughdata suggesting that gays and lesbianshave higher incomes than the averageAmerican have been widely publicized,gays and lesbians are, in fact, foundthroughout the spectrum of income dis-tribution: some are poor, a few are rich,and most are in the middle. 4There appears to be a distinction, however,between gays and lesbians, with lesbiansearning less, despite relatively similareduction levels as gay men. Income differ-ences also are evident along color lines. 5 There is some intriguing evidence thatgays and lesbians played a disproportion-ate role in creating the Internet economy.One recent study found a significant cor-relation between the size of a city 's gay population and the vibrancy of its neweconomy sector. Increasing numbers ofcompanies are recognizing the advan-tages of promoting a \"gay-friendly \" image. Among the strategies companieshave used: implementing human resourcepolicies that recognize domestic partners as spousal equivalents for insurance andpension benefits; developing advertisingthat features positive images of gays andlesbians; and selling products specificallyto the community through gay- and les-bian-focused media. The evidence sug-gests that these kinds of efforts pay off: Avast majority of gays and lesbians say theyprefer brands that recognize and includethem, while 87 percent report boycottingcompanies known to have negativestance toward the population. 1 The significance of this statistic is much disputed. It does not take into account the fact that men andwomen choose different careers, such as police ver-sus elementary school teachers, which may pay dif-ferently. Nor does it register the fact that men andwomen, even within the same career, often choosedifferent trajectories, with women more likely totake several years off at midcareer to bear and raisechildren. There has been surprisingly little solidresearch on what the residual differential is whenthese and other potentially relevant factors are con-trolled for. However, thoughtful analysts estimatethat there probably remains a small but statisticallysignificant gap. 2 Recent Supreme Court decisions such as Chevron v. Echazabal, 122 S.Ct. 2045 (2002), US Airways v. Bar- nett, 122 S.Ct. 1516 (2002), Toyota v. Williams, 122 S.Ct. 681 (2002), and Barnes, et al. v. Gorman, 122 S. Ct. 2097 (2002) on ADA will significantly impact thelives of people with disabilities.

On thebasis of what you know so far, you probably can 't tell how much consideration to give your colleague 's expressed prefer- ence. What do you do? Well, you can ask your colleague toelaborate on her point of view; you can, after the meeting, dis-creetly ask others who know her better how emphatically she tends to express herself; you can ask her to summarize herview in a memo; or you can simply take note of the ambigu-ity, and continue to observe her in future interactions. Thepoint of being aware of cultural differences is not to mechan-ically ascribe everything to those differences, but to becomemore skillful at making the kind of nuanced judgments thatare critical to long-term business success. Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 55CRA second conceptual dilemma dividing the diversity movement has to do with the set of problems or issues thatare seen as particularly problematic. Because diversity is ulti-mately about changing how individuals and groups interact,and the terms on which they interact, the endeavor canfounder along fundamental questions: What determineshuman behavior: Psychology? Culture? Institutional struc-tures? What weight should we assign each of these elements,and how do we model their interaction? These are amongthe perennial questions of social scientists, and it shouldn 't be a surprise that diversity consultants don 't have any con- clusive answers to them. Unfortunately, rather than recognize this dilemma for what it is, many diversity consultants have tended to holdup a piece of the puzzle and present it as the whole. Thus,some focus on the continuing problem of stereotyping andsubconscious prejudice. Others argue that behavior, notopinions, are the proper focus of diversity initiatives. Forthem, people 's thoughts and feelings are their own business; what counts is that they don 't behave in a racist or sexist manner on the job. Still others focus on changing the cor-porate culture. They argue that too much attention to theindividual employee pins responsibility on the wrong agent.If a diversity initiative fails, they say, it is usually not becausesome individual employees have failed, but because thecompany 's rules, procedures, practices, and so on, favor cer- tain groups over others. To bring this circle to a close, thosewho insist on psychological approaches then criticize theinstitutionalists for failing to appreciate the many subtleways that prejudice affects even the most benign and well-intentioned. The resulting cacophony can sound like aproverbial group of blind men describing an elephant \u2014an unusually large and cumbersome elephant, at that. This essay generally adopts a wide-angle approach, trying to get as much of the elephant into the picture as possible. Inthe sections that follow, it looks at the cultural and institu-tional factors that affect intergroup relations and that can \u2014 often inadvertently \u2014serve to benefit some groups at the expense of others. It surveys the literature of several disci-plines, from social psychology to anthropology to manage-ment theory, to sketch out some of the key insights of eachinto the complex set of forces that influence how we behavetoward each other. And it offers its own synthesis of viewsabout how to develop a diversity approach that respects dif-ferences without sacrificing the essential unity and disciplinethat any corporation needs to succeed. Cultural Divides Not all diversity-related problems arise out of the prejudices and stereotypes that we may consciously or subconsciouslyharbor about each other. Consider the case of James andHiroko, two casual friends at a regional accounting firm,jointly assigned to be team leaders of a task force developingthe company 's Web site. Their boss hoped the two friends would bring complementary strengths to the project, andthe two honestly looked forward to working with each other.Brash, self-confident, intense, James, a seventh-generation American of Dutch-English descent, had a quick, analyticalmind and the ability to energize the people around him.Hiroko, a first-generation Japanese American who hadgrown up in America as a diplomat 's daughter, was quieter, more reflective, with an elegant personal aesthetic that herboss hoped would rub off on the Web site. Yet it wasn 't long before James found himself frustrated by what he viewed as Hiroko 's failure to participate in the fast-paced give-and-take of the task force meetings. Againand again, he would discuss matters beforehand with Hirokoand win her approval on critical decisions, only to find thatshe would fail to support his proposals \u2014or worse, concur with an opposing idea. He couldn 't understand why Hiroko consistently sought to waste valuable time in the meetingsdoing work that could be accomplished more efficiently byindividual members of the team working on their own. Andhe was dismayed that Hiroko refused to honestly confrontthe problems they were having, despite his best efforts tobroach them with her. \"I thought Japanese were supposed to be so efficient and team-spirited, \" he thought, ruefully. Hiroko, for her part, had imagined that she was used to American directness, but found James remarkably insensi-tive. She couldn 't understand why he was so quick to shoot down ideas that originated from others, or even show themthe courtesy of properly considering them. It seemed onlycommon sense to her that the task force would work on thebig items collectively \u2014otherwise what was the good of put- ting the team together? And truth be told, James ' aggressive body language and tendency to invade her space made hernervous, though she knew this was just the American way,magnified, perhaps, by James ' outsize personality. In this case, neither James nor Hiroko began with nega- tive emotions or stereotypes of each other \u2014if anything, the stereotypes they might have subconsciously harbored weredistinctly positive. The problem lay in the cultural gapbetween the two, the way each person \"read\" the other on the basis of assumptions and understandings they hadacquired over years of socialization. The sad aspect of thiscase is that both James and Hiroko knew of the danger ofmaking cultural assumptions and tried to overcome them.James tried to engage Hiroko in a frank discussion of theproblems they were encountering; Hiroko knew, and madeallowances for, American styles of self-expression and bodylanguage. Yet both, in the end, proved unable to overcometheir own cultural assumptions and beliefs, and the value-laden judgments that came with them. The anthropologist Edward Hall, one of the early pioneers of the \"culture \" concept, famously said that we are \"captives of our culture, \" rarely more conscious of it than a fish is of water. Culture, in this case, means something different fromwhat it means when we say of someone who likes the balletand opera that she is \"very cultured. \" In the anthropological sense, culture refers to the totality of ways that we understandand interact with our environment and each other \u2014the norms, values, beliefs, understandings, orientations, and so 56 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002on, that govern our actions and behaviors. As the metaphor of the fish in water suggests, our own culture surrounds us yet remains largely invisible. Think, byway of analogy, of a person 's accent or language. Usually, we think of other people as speaking with an accent. Few of us are aware that we speak with any discernible accent until we areput in the situation of being different from the norm. Eventhen, we silently wonder why they don't speak like us. Culture extends and amplifies this problem. As in the case of our accent or language, the awareness that our normal,habitual, \"default \" way of doing things is particular, rather than universal, usually only arises whenwe are faced with someone who doesthings differently \u2014or when we, our- selves, become aware that we are differ-ent. Unlike language, however, it 's not always clear what the difference consistsof. Most of what constitutes a culture ishidden from us by its very ubiquity. It isnot just the words that differ, but theassumptions, beliefs, and values thatunderlie which words get said and inwhat context. We know what the Por-tuguese word for knife is; or at least, weknow that Portuguese has a more-or-lessexact corresponding word for knife (anassumption we couldn 't make, by the way, of some hunter-gatherer tribes inthe Amazon jungle). But we don 't know, except by long immersion in the culture,what a Brazilian way of doing business is,what norms of reciprocity, timeliness, for-mality, trust, hospitality, hierarchy, status,and so on, should govern any given situ-ation. All we can be sure of is that theyprobably differ in important respectsfrom our own. The problem is that we instinctively expect others to behave more or less aswe do. We 've been taught \u2014our whole experience in the world has taught us \u2014 what to expect, what 's normal, fair, or reasonable. We rely on those expecta-tions to make sense of the world and tobe able to function credibly within it.When those expectations are foiled, wecan become frustrated, angry, or with-drawn. Craig Storti, an ex-Peace Corpsvolunteer who has written an excellentbook ( \" The Art of Crossing Cultures \") about cross-cultural adaptation, says thatthe key is to become aware of our emo-tional reactions to cross-cultural differ-ences as they arise. This is no easy process. Most of the time, we simply have emotions. True,we may seek to control them by tamping them down, or by inhibiting our expression of them, but for the most part, wedon't think self-critically about our emotions as we are experiencing them. Becoming aware of what we are feeling,and being able to articulate that feeling with some speci-ficity, is, therefore, something of a learned skill. But it is,Storti argues, one that can have a big payoff (see figure 3). Storti focuses on culture shock, the cumulative, multi- ple pressures that come from living abroad. It is a weary-ing condition, like always being the new kid in a schoolwhere they don 't speak your language, teach unfamiliar subjects, and serve food you 're not used to. But many of the same dynam-ics are at work whenever individualsof different cultures come together.The potential client from Turkey, theHispanic co-worker, the Thai subordi-nate: Increasingly, all of us are beingforced to deal with people who comefrom different cultures. 3And how effectively we perform our jobdepends in part on how well we canwork across cultural divides. But how, short of a deep immersion in a culture, can we develop the inter-cultural facility Storti speaks about?Without the daily, in-depth, experi-ence of encountering differences, howcan we learn to behave in a culturallysensitive manner? Today 's visitor may be from Turkey, but tomorrow 's will be from Brazil, and next week 's from South Africa. The same variety is trueof our employees. We can 't be expected to know and understand thecultural background of every personwe do business with. Part of the answer to that question is that no one expects us to. If your busi-ness requires you to be in regular contactwith a specific group \u2014whether you 're a restauranteur or a banker \u2014learning a lit- tle about the culture and people you arein contact with will almost certainlyrepay the effort, and learning a lot aboutthem can be a life-enriching process. Butin most cases, it is enough simply to beaware that differences can arise. Moni-toring your behavior, and reflecting onthe other person 's, can help guide you toward an accommodation. You don 't need to be an expert; people will appre-ciate your sensitivity provided you seemto be making a good-faith effort to com-prehend them. Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 57 Figure 3. Process of ad justmen t We expect but the y are n't Thus , a cultura lincident occurs , caus ing , and wewithdraw .We beco me awar eof our react ion. We reflectonits cause And No question has spawned as much debate in the diversity field as the question of how an organization ought tochange if it is to accommodate diversity. In part, this isbecause the question is highly abstract; even people whomight agree about the right course of action in any specificinstance can disagree passionately about their rationale forpursuing it. There is, as well, a tendency among diversityexperts to cordon off different answers to the question asthough each represented a major shift in policy, beforearticulating their own (patented and improved) approach.In fact, most of the diversity strategies that have beendeveloped probably aren 't as distinctive in practice as they are in theory. Still, it is worth outlining some of the morecommon responses. The first might be said to be the \" Golden Rule \" approach. This approach demands of all employees that they treat eachother as they, themselves, would wish to be treated. It is prob-ably the default diversity management strategy among smallto mid-size firms without formalized human resource func- tions \u2014in other words, among firms where the policy is largely unarticulated. It understands that discrimination andprejudice are wrong, and its underlying goal is to see to it thatthe employees get along. What it does not do is recognizethat more subtle forms of discrimination exist, or acknowl-edge that the company itself needs to do things differently toensure that everyone is given a fair chance to succeed. The \" Right the Wrongs \" approach was popular in the 1970s and early 1980s but has since been waning. For manyyears, it served as the primary basis for affirmative actionprograms. The emphasis of this approach is on ensuringthat women and minorities are granted their \"fair share \" of opportunities throughout the organization. In practice,many of these programs focus on entry-level positions, withthe expectation that the effects will radiate upwardsthrough the organization over time. Part of the reason thisapproach is waning is that those expectations have notbeen met to the degree it was hoped. The \" Assimilation \" approach takes a more aggressive pos- ture to ensuring the success of minorities and women. Itunderstands that traditionally excluded groups are not aslikely to possess the soft skills and competencies of the his-torically dominant group, and makes proactive efforts to\"socialize \" them into the organization. An example of such apolicy might be a special orientation session for new recruits of color, or mentoring programs designed to familiarize non-traditional groups with the organization 's values and mores. The \" Multicultural \" approach, by contrast, is predicated on the notion that minorities and women bring strengthsrather than deficiencies to the organization. It seeks ways tocapitalize on these strengths. The primary exponent of thisapproach is R. Roosevelt Thomas, who urges corporations torevisit the assumptions that define the work culture in orderto make the organization work more effectively for all itsemployees. Thomas identifies several of the most commonof these assumptions: The notion of the manager as theteam captain, whose primary job is to lead by the example ofhis or her performance, rather than as the coach, whose jobit is to elicit the best performance of everyone on the team;the idea that the company is a family, which can, he says,seem paternalistic to many minorities; and the notion thatmanaging diversity is an event rather than a process. A few years after Thomas ' seminal publication in the Har- vard Business Review , David Thomas (no kin to Roosevelt) and Robin Ely published their own managing-diversity approachin the same publication. For Thomas and Ely, the diversityfield has already undergone one significant shift: It hasmoved from a \"discrimination-and-fairness \" paradigm to an \"access-and-legitimacy \" paradigm, which they characterize in terms similar to the ones Thomas uses to describe themovement from affirmative action to multiculturalism. Thatshift, they say, entails a recognition of the positive benefits ofhaving a diverse workforce. Its raison d 'etre is the need to respond to the nation 's increasing heterogeneity through a more representative labor force. Its strength is its emphasis onthe business rationale, a motivation the entire companycould support. Its weakness, say Thomas and Ely, is that ittends to push minorities into pigeonholes such as humanresources or community outreach. There has not been a cor-responding effort to integrate them into the company 's mainstream, revenue-generating work. The \"learning-and-effectiveness \" paradigm that Thomas and Ely propose is based on \"rethinking primary tasks and redefining markets, products, strategies, missions, businesspractices, and even cultures \" by incorporating employees ' perspectives into the main work of the organization. It pro-motes equal opportunity and recognizes cultural differences,but it goes beyond the earlier two paradigms in asking of thecorporation that it internalize differences among employeesso that it learns and grows from them. For Thomas and Ely, the key to making such an organiza- tion viable, to giving employees a feeling that they have astake in the company, is to change its culture. That culturaltransformation takes many forms. It means pushing theorganization toward the demands of flexibility, openness,and spontaneity over hierarchy, control, and secrecy. Itmeans focusing on the employee 's workplace satisfaction, on supporting both individual initiative and group cohe-siveness. It means redefining the role of the loyal subordi-nate. \"By condemning loyalty construed in terms of unques- 58 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002 The great challenge is to reconcile complex andsometimescompeting notionsover fairness and equality.tioning servitude and praising people who have the courage to question, blind obedience can be stigmatized, \" say a team of management professors from Columbia University. And itmeans emphasizing cooperation and teamwork, consensualproblem solving and decision making. All these traits, sayexperts, are likely to provide the context in which a diversityof opinions, personalities, and types can flourish. Con-versely, they are also likely to be the types of organizationsthat most benefit from diversity. The next section will examine how to put these ideas into practice. Best Practices Overview Once upon a time, it was going to be so simple. White men, forced by law to change, would set aside the prejudices andstereotypes they had used to exclude other groups for solong. Liberated from their oppression, people of color andwomen would quickly achieve social and economic parity. Today that dream can feel like chimera. Though they dis- agree passionately about the reasons, both the right and leftagree that the manifest inequalities that marked social rela-tions during the days of Jim Crow have not faded nearly asmuch as most people had hoped they would. A vast gulf inperceptions prevails: Most people of color and womenbelieve that racism and sexism are alive and well; most whitemen believe that incidents of discrimination are the excep-tion, and worry more about false accusations than abouteliminating ongoing disparities. Much of the diversity fieldultimately springs from this conundrum: We have achieveda formal legal equality but not economic and social equality. For business leaders, this dilemma plays out in various ways: In decisions over who to hire, promote, or terminate,but also in issues as mundane as who sits with whom at thecafeteria. The great challenge for diversity managers is toreconcile complex and sometimes competing notions overbasic values of fairness and equality. It is to balance the factthat social systems, left to their own devices, tend to repro-duce themselves along race, class, and gender lines, withinterventions that do not create unintended inequalities oftheir own. It is to create a level playing field that yieldsresults that are not only fair, but seen as fair, by very differ-ent constituency groups. The following section outlines how an organization might square these various circles. It discusses how to goabout instituting a diversity initiative, summarizes the prin-ciples on which one should be based, and provides a menuof real-world practices that companies have found useful.Diversity is an intrinsically controversial topic. But thesepolicies and practices can help companies forge a consensuson how best to proceed. A Strategy With apologies to Tolstoy, most successful diversity pro- grams are alike, but every unsuccessful one is unsuccessful inits own way. This section focuses on the common, underly- ing principles of successful diversity efforts \u2014the strategies, rather than the tactics. In later sections, we 'll take a look at the nuts-and-bolts, the actual policies and procedures thatmake for successful diversity initiatives. In this section, thefocus is at a higher level of abstraction: Not on what needs tobe done, but on what needs to be the case, the precondi-tions, for any effort to succeed. Perhaps the single most important ingredient in success- ful diversity programs is commitment from the top. In fact,it's safe to say that no diversity effort has ever really suc- ceeded without that commitment. Diversity is too amor-phous, too easily relegated to a second-tier status, to bedriven by subordinates. If diversity is not a leadership prior-ity\u2014and just as importantly, seen as a leadership priority \u2014 it can wither on the vine, a succession of half-instituted,uncoordinated measures. That doesn 't mean that the CEO must oversee the day-to-day management of the initiative.But it should be clear that the top brass are taking the effortsseriously, and that they expect everyone else in the com-pany to do so as well. As Ted Childs of IBM puts it, \"Employ- ees devote their energies to what the management spends itstime on, because that 's how they know what management truly believes to be important. \" Jack, a sales executive with a software design company, remembers what can happen when leaders fail to \"walk the talk\" on diversity issues. \"Diversity was always something of a joke \" at his old firm, he says. \"Every once in a while, the top brass would issue some memo about how everyone at thefirm is valued and how we should respect our differences, andeveryone would say, 'Yes, boss, ' and then we would go on doing exactly what we were doing beforehand. It bred a cer-tain amount of cynicism \u2014about diversity, but ultimately, about the leadership itself. Most of the rank-and-file engi-neers felt these were just token pronouncements designed tokeep the company in the clear if there was ever any lawsuit. \" There is the opposite danger, of course. And that is that the leadership gets too far in front of the rank-and-file, thatit is perceived as bullying or threatening. Diversity is alreadya loaded topic. People bring a great deal of anxiety, fear, andhope to the table once a diversity initiative is announced:\"Does this mean that I won 't get that promotion because I 'm not the right race/sex, etc.?; Does this mean I 'll finally be able to sign my partner up for health benefits, and if so, is ittime for me to come out of the closet? Does this mean I 'm going to be sued/fired/reprimanded for that racy joke I toldlast week at lunch? \" If leaders act too quickly, fail to educate employees, and attempt to diversify by fiat rather than bycoaching, the effort can end badly. \"There 's nothing worse than management suddenly 'get- ting religion, '\" says Tyler Vance, a diversity consultant who has seen \"too many \" such efforts backfire. One firm invited him to come in after a particularly disastrous presentation byone of the senior vice presidents. \"The VP gave the keynote speech at a corporate retreat on diversity, \" Vance recalls. \"He pulled out all these charts and graphs, which basically Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 59A Best Practices Cheat Sheetshowed that the company, no surprise, was filled with white men. And then he pulled out a new set of charts, demon-strating how the company 's racial/gender profile would be expected to change over the next five years. Well, you don 't need to be a genius to figure out how all the white menreacted. The whole weekend was spent discussing 'reverse racism ' and 'double standards. ' It took months to neutralize the bad feelings that developed out of that one speech. \" That brings us to the second principle: Bring people on board. Explain diversity in a way that encourages employeesto feel they have a stake in its success. That means makingsure that they understand three things, says Vance. First, that diversity is about inclusiveness; that it 's not simply a code word for minority concerns, butembraces a new way of thinking about maximizingthe potential of everyone within the organization. Second, that diversity is not simply the right thing to do, it 's also the smart thing to do. Whether it 's foster- ing intergroup understanding within the corporation,or improving the company 's ability to serve an increas- ingly diverse market or client base, diversity hasincreasingly become a business imperative. Third, that they will be consulted in the development of the diversity plan. \"There is no better way to get people on board than by encouraging them to partici-pate from the outset, \" says Vance. \"Often, employees will have better, more effective ideas about how to pro-ceed than the leadership. Diversity can 't be micro- managed; set goals and help your team achieve them. \" Once you 've secured commitment from the top and begun bringing people on board, the next step is to assesswhere the organization currently stands. This is commonlydone through a diversity audit. There are perils associatedwith conducting a diversity audit \u2014the main one being that the company may be forced to disclose the results in theevent of litigation. (Of course, the same audit cannot be usedas a sword against litigant claims without then becoming dis-coverable.) Furthermore, as Cyrus Mehri, one of the nation 's leading employment lawyers points out, the danger onlyreally comes about if the company simply shelves the subse-quent report. \"When your folks come to you [with a report of 60 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002General Principles: Engage in an ongoing study and eval- uation of the organization 's current efforts to promote diversity. Eliminate any policies and practices that present ongoing barriers tominorities. Decide what the organization 's short- and long-term diversity goals shouldbe. Develop a coherent plan to reach these goals, and set aside sufficientresources to help bring them about. Establish clear policies, communicate them to all employees, and followthem rigorously. Conduct periodic reviews of policies and programs to establish how wellthey are working to promote diver-sity. Make diversity a bottom-line issue and hold managers accountable forachieving results. Recruitment: Define carefully and accurately the job selection criteria, such as the par-ticular skills and abilities required,before the selection process begins. Partner with minority associationsand educational institutions, partici- pate in minority career festivals, andadvertise in minority media. Develop educational outreach pro- grams, such as scholarships, intern-ships, and work/study programs. Explore community involvement options that bring the companygoodwill and that open lines of com-munication. Work on eliminating barriers to hiring minorities, and communicate to allstakeholders the company 's ongoing efforts to expand the candidate pool. Make sure that all of those responsi- ble for hiring are fully briefed on thecompany 's policies and legal require- ments regarding affirmative actionand diversity. Promotion and Advancement: Make an affirmative effort to identify and develop high-potential employ-ees across all lines \u2014racial, gender, disability, and so on. Enable employees to expand their potential by making educational andtraining opportunities widely available. Establish broad-based mentoring pro- grams that cut across affinity groups,and make sure that mentors are given the training they need to successfullynurture junior employees who arewomen and people of color. Provide employees with tools, such as career resource centers and evalua-tion programs, to help them proac-tively manage their own careers. Keep promotion policies transparent and ensure that opportunities areaccessible to all. Study and validate promotion and compensation policies and proce-dures. Terms and Conditions: Develop family-friendly policies and flexible work arrangements that helpemployees cope with the work/familydilemma. Provide anti-sexual harassment and discrimination training to all employ-ees, and make sure they participate. Keep informed about emerging tech- nological innovations that help bringpeople with disabilities into the work-force. Adopt a presumption that reasonable accommodations can be found formost issues, ranging from religion toracial disparities], instead of ignoring them, take them seri- ously. \" That, he says, is what Coca Cola failed to do, both with an internal report and a Department of Labor analysis.As a result, he says, \"litigation became the last resort. \" Because the methodological issues are so complex, an outside consulting firm is usually retained to conduct theaudit. There is, unfortunately, an unusually wide variety inthe quality of diversity-related consulting firms. A good con-sulting firm will employ a well-credentialed team of socialpsychologists, sociologists, and lawyers with experience incivil rights, employment law, and organizational behavior.The best will typically draw staff from the major federalenforcement agencies as well as from academia and privatefirms specializing in diversity-related issues. A typical diversity audit consists of three elements: A demographic profile of the company by race and gender,cross-checked against income or job rank/category; a surveyof employee attitudes and opinions regarding diversity issuesand the company 's handling of them; and an analysis of corporate policies, systems, and practices that may have dis-parate impacts on different groups within the workforce. Afourth element is sometimes added: An investigation into the company 's efforts to reach traditionally underserved and emerging markets. In this case, the goal is not to conduct amarket analysis (which the company is presumably muchbetter equipped to undertake), but to examine the extent towhich the company itself has explored the viability of alter-nate profit centers. To maintain privilege, circulation of thecompleted audit, with its findings and recommendations, isusually restricted to senior management. The next step in the process is the development of a strategic plan to promote diversity. The audit answered thequestion: \"Where are we now [when it comes to diversity]? \" The strategic plan follows up by addressing the twin ques-tions: \"Where do we want to be? \" and \"How do we get there? \" To put it differently, an audit is the diagnosis; a plan is the proposed course of treatment. A strategic diversityplan typically consists of the following elements: 1. A brief, cogent analysis of the business case for diver- sity as it specifically relates to the company. A finan-cial consulting firm will have different reasons forundertaking a diversity initiative than a baby food Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 61pregnancy to disabilities. Conduct a periodic \"disability- friendly \" audit of the physical work environment. Develop a system to monitor com- pensation and performance appraisalto ensure that they are discrimina-tion-free. Termination and Downsizing: Communicate the reasons for the ter- mination clearly and succinctly. Minimize the pain of downsizing by encouraging voluntary departuresand early retirement. Consider providing grief and anger management counseling immedi-ately after the termination. Train managers to follow procedures that minimize corporate liability. Provide as much assistance to the ter- minated employees as possible,including training and education, jobplacement, and counseling. Alternative Dispute Resolution: Consider implementing any or all of the following: employee hotline,ombudsman program, peer reviewpanel, senior management reviewpanel, mediation program, and an arbitration program. Eschew the temptation to institute a binding arbitration program as a con-dition of employment. Clearly communicate a \"no retalia- tion\" program and discipline severely anyone who violates it. Management Commitment and Accountability: Get the CEO on board and keep the CEO on board. No diversity initiativecan succeed without strong CEO sup-port. Articulate a clear reason why it is nec- essary for the company to pursuediversity in the 21st century, andcommunicate that vision to allemployees. Establish clear goals and mile markers to measure performance. Tie management compensation, in part, to success in meeting andexceeding diversity-related goals. Create an organization capable of ongoing self-evaluation and self-cor-rection on diversity issues. Take steps to increase the diversity of the board of directors, and ensurethat they require proper accounting and self-reporting procedures, andhold management accountable fordiversity goals. Other Practices: Conduct diversity and harassment training for all employees, and maketraining part of the orientation fornew hires. Support the formation of affinity groups, and consult with them indeveloping diversity-related policiesand projects. Make a proactive effort to hire minor- ity- and women-owned contractorswhenever possible. Promote heritage festivals and diver- sity-related celebrations. Market diversity in-house as a critical component of the company 's ethos. Make company policies, practices, and goals, as well as employees ' diversity-related rights and responsi-bilities, fully known and understood. Hire outside diversity consultants with the same care you would hire, forexample, safety experts, or financialconsultants. CRmanufacturer. Articulating why diversity is \"mission critical \" helps a company set its priorities. A baby food maker may be particularly intrigued by the marketpotential of Hispanic and Asian immigrants; a whiteshoe financial consulting firm may be motivated bypolitical and legal considerations to diversify its exec-utive labor force. 2. Recommendations regarding mechanisms, such as affinity groups, vertical representative committees, orWeb-based anonymous suggestion boxes, for involvingemployees in the diversity initiative and incorporatingtheir concerns and ideas. This enables continuous feed-back and response, giving managers the opportunity toadjust and improve on their performance. 3. Proposals for institutionalizing the diversity initiative through the creation (or strengthening) of a diversity-related office at the executive level with well-definedresponsibilities and powers. Chief among these pow-ers should be the ability to investigate, assess, meas-ure, and make recommendations directly to the chiefoperating officer. A second and equally importantfunction of the office should be to act as a clearinghouse for companywide practices and policies, such asinternal marketing, minority internship, training, ormentoring programs, that promote diversity. 4. A list of clearly defined goals, based on existing out- come \"gaps\" discovered through the audit, setting forth the reasons for their adoption and determining whatresources and commitments are necessary to accom-plish them. Note that it is not enough simply to setgoals; to say, for example, that mid-career female attri-tion rates should drop by 25 percent over the next fiveyears, or that the market share for a new demographicbase should increase by 50 percent. By themselves,these are merely wishes. The plan must clearly enunci-ate how these goals are to be achieved. The goal of low-ering attrition rates of mid-career women might bereached through providing various types of maternalassistance, such as in-house day care facilities, flexiblehours, or the creation of part-time \"parental \" tracks. For items that are not clearly gaps or problems, the goalshould be continuous monitoring and improvement.5. A clearly defined set of diversity metrics. Measuring progress is essential, and although diversity wouldappear to be a relatively nebulous concept and there-fore difficult to measure, there are in fact many waysto proceed. The audit should have provided baselinenumbers regarding hiring, performance evaluations,disciplinary actions, complaint ratios, promotion andattrition or retention figures, workplace satisfactionsurveys, company demographics, market shares, andso on. Annual reviews of these figures can help firmsidentify areas of concern and achievement. 6. Finally, a strategic plan should contain accountability metrics. If diversity is a bottom-line issue, then itshould be granted bottom-line priority. That meansmaking managers accountable for their success or fail-ure in this area, and rewarding or punishing themaccordingly. Superior performance merits promotions,bonuses, awards, and other types of recognition. Developing a strategic diversity plan is a lengthy, labori- ous process. But most companies that have been through itfind the exercise well worthwhile. \"Developing a plan forces a company to think through its priorities and come to gripswith the issues raised by diversity, \" says consultant Tyler Vance. \"The process itself throws up a lot of issues: Who gets consulted, who gets to make the decisions. \" Vance cau- tions against outsourcing too much of this work: \"Compa- nies are sometimes tempted to hire an outside consultant todraw up a diversity plan for them. And a competent con-sultant can come back with an itemized list of 15, or for thatmatter 150, recommendations. But a really good consultantcan do something more important: Help the companyinternalize the process of change. \" Vance acknowledges the difficulties inherent in this approach. \"I think there 's a certain amount of trepidation that diversity initiatives will undermine the leadership, thatit's opening a Pandora 's box for airing resentments or griev- ances. \" That fear is generally overblown, says Vance. But to make sure that the conversation doesn 't veer off track, the key is to be clear about what 's at issue: \"The question is not how to become a more fair, or just, or compassionate organ-ization. The question is much more practical: How can weleverage the diversity of our organization to our competitiveadvantage? How can we make sure that all of our employ-ees' human capital is being fully utilized? \" Of course, answering that question requires more than just a set of principles. It requires tactics, policies, and pro-cedures. These will be discussed in the next section. A Collection of Tactics A good diversity program embodies values that are consis- tently upheld and regularly reaffirmed. But it is a hollowshell unless it follows through on its commitments withday-to-day practices that produce real-world results. Thepractices that follow are drawn from actual companies thathave been at the forefront of efforts to promote diversity. 62 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002 Companies have developed a broad range of practices designed to promoteand celebrate diversity . They range from aggressiveefforts to identify and dobusiness with minority-owned firms, to culturalheritage appreciation days.For the sake of analytical convenience, they are sorted into six categories: Recruitment and Hiring; Promotion andCareer Advancement; Terms and Conditions of Employ-ment; Dispute Resolution; Management Accountability;and other, system-wide practices. But many of the ideasbehind them are applicable across the board. Indeed, thereis something of a new consensus emerging: The best prac-tices for diversity are those that are not specific to any onegroup, but that promote opportunities for all. As MariaJohnson, head of diversity for Fannie Mae, points out,\"Instead of special programs, the focus should be on help- ing everyone reach their potential and achieve theirdreams \u2014whether it 's home ownership, completing college, or simply knowing that there is an emergency day care facil-ity available. \" Recruitment and Hiring Many employers have found that it takes a conscious effort to hire a diverse workforce. If they don 't make the effort, they end up with a workforce that is de facto segregated by jobdescription, with whites, Asian Pacific Americans, and asprinkling of African Americans constituting the professionalstaff, and blacks and Hispanics among the clerical and blue-collar workers. How and why does this happen? Well, in part,it reflects disparities in professional and academic achieve-ment. There are proportionately fewer Hispanic lawyers thanthere are Hispanics among the general population. It wouldbe mathematically impossible for every law firm in Californiato have a number of Hispanic partners on staff proportionalto their population in the state. But there are other reasons as well. Think about how a lot of recruiting takes place, particularly at smaller organiza-tions: So-and-so 's nephew is looking for a job, the uncle mentions it to a buddy of his at the bar, the buddy knowsabout an opening at the plant where he works, and vouchesfor the kid to his supervisor. The next day, the nephew getscalled in for an interview. If we lived in a completely inte-grated society, this sort of practice wouldn 't result in racial or ethnic disparities. But we don 't: The nephew, the uncle, and the buddy are all likely to be of the same ethnic group,and a process that did not involve anyone making con-scious, intentional efforts to discriminate ended up havinga disparate impact. There are other seemingly neutral practices that can also result in disparate impacts. Just as many whites might notbe comfortable applying for a job at, say, Ebony magazine, so many people of color may feel uncomfortable or reluctantto apply at, say, a local, family-owned hardware store. Evena well-intentioned employer seeking to diversify its work-force may not know where to advertise or what accommo-dations can be made to provide for qualified individualswith disabilities. But increasingly, firms are not content to leave it at that, and are making conscious efforts to increase their potentialapplicant pool. In fact, more and more companies seem toagree about the necessity of engaging in this kind of affir-mative action, even as older forms of affirmative action come under increasing judicial scrutiny. \"We understand the need to change, and we are, \" says David Bullard, of Amex International. \"At the same time, we don 't want to feel compelled to act because of court decisions. Making aneffort to increase the diversity of the applicant pool andcandidate slate is the best way we 've found to balance merit with fairness in our hiring decisions. \" Among the efforts now underway to increase the diversity of the applicant pool are internships and work/study pro-grams, community outreach efforts, and aggressive recruit-ing drives among nontraditional employee groups. At theBureau of National Affairs (BNA), a publishing companybased in Washington, DC, that specializes in legal informa-tion services, representatives attend numerous job fairs spon-sored by minority associations and colleges. The BNA spon-sors its own scholarship program, which provides funds tostudents at minority universities and gives them the oppor-tunity to work as interns. The BNA has also developed aneditorial traineeship which grooms minority staff withpotential to become professional journalists and editors. Promotion and Career Advancement Many of the barriers that act against hiring minorities also militate against their promotion. In-group favoritism (theold-boy network), the Pygmalion effect, the proportionaldearth of qualified candidates, inadequate knowledge aboutwhere to advertise openings, all play a role. Many minori-ties in corporate America feel that they don 't have access to the same informal mentoring that helps their white col-leagues climb the corporate ladder; that they don 't get the honest performance evaluation and searching feedback thatcan contribute to their growth; and that they don 't get the opportunities to take on risky or high-profile assignmentsthat lead to senior positions. Fannie Mae is a mortgage financial services company based in Washington, DC, and one of the few Fortune 500companies with an African American CEO. It has developedan extensive mentoring program consisting of three ele-ments: A speaker series, which seeks to expose employees topositive role models within Fannie Mae and beyond; a men-tor/protege program, which provides one-on-one coachingbetween senior and junior managers; and a Buddy program,which is designed to pair new hires with established ones tohelp familiarize them with the company 's workings. Partly as a result, says senior workforce manager Maria Johnson,Fannie Mae is among the nation 's leaders in corporate diversity. \"If you compare our employment rates to the rel- evant labor poor, we far exceed those standards at everylevel. Of our 168 officers, the most senior executives on ourstaff of 4,800, 23 percent are minority. \" Mentoring has proven to be among the most promising of today 's best practices. Harvard Business School professor David Thomas, who has conducted the most extensiveinvestigation to date of successful minority executives, Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 63continued on page 66An Interview with Cyrus Mehri 64 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002Having spearheaded discrimination lawsuits against Texaco and Coca Cola that fetched record settlements, Cyrus Mehri, now 40 years old, is one of the nation 's leading employment discrimination lawyers. But it 's not the sums he 's won for his clients that have most impressed observers; rather, it 's the broad institutional changes he 's helped bring about at these companies. In the Coca Cola case, for example, the changes include the creation of an outside seven-member independent task force mandated to ensure compli - ance with the settlement and to oversee Coca Cola 's diversity efforts. Now at Mehri & Skalet, PLLC, a Washington, DC-based firm, Mehri spoke with CRJ in late October 2001. More information on Mehri is available at the firm 's Web site, www.FindJustice.com. CRJ: Let me begin with a very broad question. Do you see the casesyou've litigated so far as exceptionsor as symptoms? In other words,how severe a problem do you thinkracism and discrimination are in cor-porate America? Mehri: These aren 't problems that are specific to any one company. What cor-porate America views as its best prac-tices in diversity fall far short of whatfairness requires. We 're ready to take on any company in the country becausewe believe the problems are not iso-lated to Coca Cola or Texaco. Corpo-rate America itself has a problem withsystemic discrimination. CRJ: Expand on what you mean by \"systemic discrimination. \" Mehri: Let's take it by topic or corpo- rate structure. There 's a glass ceiling where African Americans are brought inthe door, but not allowed to get up tothe higher echelons. Name the best-known companies in America and onceyou get to the executive committeesreally running these companies, you 'll see there 's virtually no diversity there. The second issue is what we 've coined the \"glass wall \" problem, where we see that the few African Americans whohave reached the higher echelons arechanneled away from the power posi-tions and profit centers. So there 's a lot of camouflaging of the problem by lay-ing out EEO-1 report numbers. But ifyou look behind these reports, you 'll see that there 's still widespread discrim- ination. How does this happen? Oneproblem we 've seen is a lot of compa- nies either don 't have a job-posting sys- tem or have a system that 's really a farce. So they 'll have this elaborate elec-tronic posting, where a job supposedly gets announced and you can competefor it. But the reality is that wholeclasses of jobs are exempted from theposting system. Or there are ways tocircumvent the posting requirement,by tailoring the job description so nar-rowly that only the preselected candi-date is qualified. Or you 'll have a secret system, what 's called a high-potential list of fast-track executives, which existsside-by-side with the explicit system.And the people drawing up that list areall white males. So what in fact is hap-pening is the same tap-on-the-shoul-der, good-old-boy network that pre-vents people from competing on theirmerits as existed before. Another problem area is in compen- sation. What tends to happen is thatcompanies give an undue discretion tomanagers and fail to examine howcompensation is being distributed andwhether there are any inequities. Theytake the ostrich approach. High-techcompanies distribute stock options thatmake people millionaires \u2014or at least they used to make people millionaires\u2014and then fail to really look at how their stock options are being distrib-uted. And if they do look, they don 't take corrective action. CRJ: Describe what the legal climate was like when you began doing thiswork. Mehri: We started doing this work in 1993, at the start of the Texaco case,when there were few private firmsenforcing the law. From the late 1970sto the early 1990s, there was a 90 per-cent decline in the number of employ-ment class action cases generally. So wefaced a situation where many of theplaintiffs had been forced to do theirhomework on their own. And they had demonstrated that there were prob-lems. They 'd prepare reports showing how African Americans were underrep-resented, how they were locked out ofthe real power centers of the company.But senior management responded bysaying things like, \"What are you guys, a bunch of black panthers? \" They 'd take the reports and stick them in thedrawer. And that just shut down thedialog, so litigation became a lastresort. And that 's when we were called in. CRJ: What kind of impact do racism and discrimination have, both on theindividual and on the company, gen-erally? Mehri: What we 've seen is that [black] employees are extremely loyal to theircompany, extremely proud to be partof it. They may have gone further thanany of their family members in previousgenerations, so they have a sense of\"Who am I to complain? \" But then they'll see that subordinates are mak- ing more money than they are, orthey'll see African Americans being shown the door one after another, andthe hurt goes far beyond the feeling ofbeing out of pocket. It has a profoundand disillusioning impact, a demoraliz-ing impact. Part of the emotional strug-gle is that the discrimination is so sub-tle. It takes a long time before peoplebegin to see it as systemic. It 's not until we meet with people, until we have 15or 20 potential class members in thesame room, that they realize that whatis happening to them is happening toothers, and they understand the moresweeping nature of the problem. The irony is that it 's really holding back these companies, because theyWinter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 65are missing out on world-class people. African Americans and other minoritiesare disproportionately leaving corpo-rate America because they end up feel-ing like the system is unfair, that theyare being locked out. And all they areasking for is an equal chance to com-pete. CRJ: Many people would say, \"Look, it's the 21st century. The Archie Bunkers and Bull Connors of theworld are long gone. How is it thatthese problems still remain? \" Mehri: I think there are different prob- lems in the white-collar and blue-collarworkforce. In the white-collar work-force, what you see is that decisionsabout compensation and promotionare ostensibly based on the evaluationsystem, but none of these companieshave really gone out and validatedthese systems to make sure they 're fair. They're based on giving undue discre- tion to managers who set different cri-teria for each person, and they 're not linked back to a careful job analysisbased on the actual content of eachperson 's job. What we 've found in company after company is that the evaluation systemsmay have eight categories, with a lot ofbusiness terms, but they basically boildown to handing out \"A\"s and \"B\"s and \"C\"s, like a school report card. And African Americans are overrepresentedin the \"B\"s. They get underrepresented in the \"A\"s and \"C\"s. So they give African Americans just enough of agrade to keep people happy or paci-fied, but not enough of a grade toadvance. So there is something terriblywrong with how corporate America ishandling its evaluation systems. CRJ: And what is happening among the blue-collar workforce? Mehri: There are a couple of issues happening there. One is that there is adramatic increase in the number ofhostile work environments in the man-ufacturing center. The other thing we 're seeing is more and more unfairness in the way testingprocedures are handled in the hourlyworkforce. So you might have a testthat determines how you go frombeing an hourly employee to being anelectrician, and that rating is worth $3or $4 an hour \u2014a tremendous eco- nomic difference. And what we 're find- ing is that these tests are antiquated,they're decades old, they 're not job related, and they 're having a huge dis- parate impact. Then we 're finding instances where there 's a kind of closed-door cheating to help the whiteemployees pass. And this battle, overpaper-and-pencil tests, is going tobecome a new old frontier, you mightsay. A new frontier for us, but a battlethat was supposedly fought and wonover a generation ago. CRJ: Say I 'm the CEO of a Fortune 500 company, and I come to you and say:\"OK, how do I improve, how do I 'Cyrus Mehriproof ' my organiza- tion? \" Mehri: (laughs.) You know, I 've never been asked by companies to come in,but if I were I could help turn themaround. Let me give you a list, but in nological order. First, I 'd have a genuine job-posting system that works and goesas far up the food chain as possible. Interms of pay grades, everything but themost senior management positionsshould be listed. I would not have anysecret promotions, any secret high-potential list. And if you are going tohave a fast-track list be very sure tocommunicate it, and what the criteriafor selection are. No more closed-door,golf-buddy selection process. I'd also make sure that the boards of directors of these companies take amore active role. Make sure that theyreceive reports, and use diversity as afactor for new board member selection.So start from the very top. I 'd also link managers ' compensation to how well they do in EEO performance. That willgo a long way. Companies should havemore mentoring and affinity group pro-grams, to help people develop profes- sionally. And finally, they should do amuch better job of gathering data andinternal reporting. They need to do amuch better job of monitoring theircompensation, evaluation, and promo-tion systems. CRJ: Tell us a little about the recent study, \"Double Standard on Appeal: An Empirical Analysis of EmploymentDiscrimination Cases in the U.S.Courts of Appeals, \" 1you commis- sioned on how employment discrim-ination cases fare in the federalappellate courts. Mehri: This was a study conducted by very distinguished, esteemed scholarsfrom Cornell Law School, and whatthey found, by looking at the hard dataover a 20-year period, was that appel-late courts seem to have a doublestandard for employment discrimina-tion cases. When a plaintiff appeals, heor she has no more than a 5 percentchance of reversing the defendant 's vic- tory at trial. But when a defendantappeals a plaintiff 's trial victory, the defendant has a 43 percent chance ofreversal. Only prison cases fare worse.The gap is so huge it cannot beexplained as anything other than biasagainst the employment plaintiffs. What makes this so astonishing is that plaintiffs have already overcome all kindsof obstacles to prevail at trial, and theseare very fact-intensive cases. So theresults of the study suggest that federalcourts use this deference to court find-ings as a shield for winning employers,but toss that shield away when it comesto reviewing employee claims. Sadly although this report was widely covered in the press, we haven 't had an adequate response from thejudiciary. In fact, we have yet to receiveany kind of thoughtful explanation atall, and you can print that. 1 Theodore Eisenberg and Stewart Schwab, \"Double Standard on Appeal: An Empirical Analysis of Employ-ment Discrimination Cases in the U.S. Courts ofAppeals, \" July 16, 2001, accessed at www.findjustice. com/ms/civil-just/schwab-report.htm.CRargues that \"people of color who advance the furthest [up the corporate ladder] all share one characteristic \u2014a strong network of mentors and corporate sponsors who nurturetheir professional development. \" Affinity groups are more controversial. Most large com- panies accept and tolerate them; a number actively promotethem and seek out their input; and a few don 't allow them at all. Those that don 't argue that affinity groups can divide employees and fracture a company 's identity. They worry that affinity groups may become advocates for specific indi-viduals and grievances, and may even lead to adversarialrelations with management. Other companies with morepositive experiences of affinity groups report that there islittle tendency for them to lead to division. And even whengroups do become advocates on specific issues, this can leadto a strengthened organization. May Snowden of Kodaksays that it is \"okay if differences emerge \" under employee network groups. \"Differences make for a robust culture, for the complexity and chaos that are marks of strength. \" Terms and Conditions The minimum legal requirement that firms must meet is equal pay for equal work.4As obvious as that principle is today, it was not so obvious even a generation ago, when itwas assumed, for example, that men should be paid morebecause they \"had families to raise. \" In the meantime, other issues have emerged: The workplace has to develop family-friendly policies, religious and disability accommodations,and anti-sexual harassment and discrimination trainingand procedures. How well a company cares for its employ-ees above and beyond meeting the legal minimum plays asignificant role in employee satisfaction, retention, and pro-ductivity Fannie Mae is another leader in worklife balance issues. It offers tuition reimbursement for employees pursuing col-lege degrees, emergency day care, five days ' annual family leave, on-site physicals, and \u2014reflecting its primary business mission \u2014up to $16,000 to help employees buy their first home. These programs help all employees, says diversitydirector Maria Johnson, but particularly those at the lowerend of the pay spectrum, by giving them access to the toolsthey need to improve their own lives. \"We think there 's a compelling productivity case to be made for these pro-grams. They pay for themselves in terms of increasedemployee productivity, loyalty, and retention. \" IBM has pioneered workforce accommodations for disabled workers, and through its engineering innova-tions, made it possible for many thousands of peoplewith disabilities, both within the company and without,to lead fuller, more productive lives. From architecturalmodifications, to electronic bulletin boards for the mobil-ity impaired, to telecommunications devices for the hear-ing impaired: Many of the devices that have becomealmost routine forms of accommodation were first devel-oped at IBM. Alternative Dispute Resolution Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) refers to those policies and practices that help bring about an early, satisfactory,and fair resolution to complaints regarding employmentdiscrimination. They can be as simple as talking to thesupervisor about unwanted attention from a colleague, topeer mediation and mandatory arbitration. 5 Among the strategies companies have developed, one feature stands out: The creation of multiple and redundantplaces for voicing and resolving complaints. One company,for example, offers the option of opening a dialogue withthe supervisor, the supervisor 's supervisor, or the human resources department, or talking directly with an ombuds-man. Another company offers five options: Dialogue withthe supervisor or a higher level of management, anemployee hotline, a conference with a company represen-tative, mediation, or arbitration. Other Best Practices Companies have developed a broad range of practices designed to promote and celebrate diversity. They rangefrom aggressive efforts to identify and do business withminority-owned firms, to cultural heritage appreciationdays. Fannie Mae, for example, recognizes and supports anarray of affinity groups, from Native American to Gay andLesbian. It draws on these groups to sponsor an annual,weeklong diversity celebration, and it recognizes, through-out the year, heritage observance months with programsand celebrations that give employees the chance to learnabout other cultures, and to share aspects of their own. United Parcel Service (UPS), the package delivery service, has a Community Internship Program, which places seniormanagers in communities of need. More than 1,200 seniormanagers have participated in the program since its incep-tion in 1968, at a cost of $10,000 per employee. For fourweeks, managers work in distant cities, becoming immersedin cultures far from their homes. They work in homelessshelters, mentor inner-city youth, aid immigrant farmworkers, build schools, and visit the home-bound. Thisexperience gives executives the opportunity to \"walk in another 's shoes, \" building sensitivity, cultural understand- 66 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002 In a nation that is becomingincreasingly multiethnic , and in a world that is ever more interconnected,diversity has become an inescapable business reality.ing, and social responsibility. But the program is not simply charitable, insists Rick Boehler, UPS ' director of workforce diversity. It also helps attune UPS executives to the increas-ingly complex needs of a diverse workforce and consumerbase. \"They 're amazed at how much they learn, \" says Boehler. \"They come back and nearly universally say the experience has made them better managers. \" Management Accountability Undergirding all of these policies and practices is manager commitment and accountability. If managers aren 't com- mitted to promoting diversity, and if they are not heldaccountable for the results, then diversity tends to becomean optional, relatively unfocused effort that produces spottyresults. Many companies these days are tying executives ' compensation packages to how well they perform on diver-sity-related matters. Often, the total amount is small: 5 per-cent or so. But the effect is to institutionalize and regularizea process so that diversity isn 't neglected. Fannie Mae is once again a leader in this area, with an Office of Diversity at the vice-presidential level reportingdirectly to the president and chief operating officer. Theoffice 's mission is to help foster a culture that maximizes and supports diversity at all levels, monitor compliance,operate the dispute resolution process, and administer thecorporate mentor program. It also works with the humanresources department to conduct assessments of the culture,and the training department to develop diversity trainingprograms. Fannie Mae 's Diversity Advisory Council is a standing committee of senior management and representa-tives of employee support groups that maintains commu-nication and ensures that the company remains responsiveto the needs of all its employees. Eastman Kodak 's global reach means that diversity is not merely a national issue, but a truly global one. The CEO hascommitted the company to increase to 40 percent the per-centage of women, minorities, and non-U.S. nationalsnominated as succession candidates to key positions. Itholds its managers responsible for reaching these goalsthrough performance ratings, and evaluates them on theirability to build and maintain a diverse workforce andencourage employees to develop their talents. The Human Factor Thus far, the focus has been on the firm, on what companies as institutions can do to maximize the benefits and mini-mize the risks of diversity. This decision to put the firm firstwas deliberate: Too many diversity initiatives focus exclu-sively on the individual. They assume that if the individualmanager or executive is made conscious of his deficits, he(and it is usually assumed to be a he) will cease to behave inways that unfairly limit the potential of minorities andwomen. The problem with this perspective is not that it isfalse, but that it is insufficient. No firm can rely simply onchanging the hearts and minds of its employees. If it is to Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 67Zero Tolerance: A Word of Caution It is tempting, in the face of potential lawsuits and the political climate that exists today, toannounce a \"zero tolerance policy \" with regard to discrimination and harassment. Imposing azero-tolerance policy gives evidence that manage-ment takes the issues seriously, and seems to elim-inate the possibility that disparities in treatmentwill arise, since every incident will receive the same(severe) response. The problem with these policies is twofold. First, a great many incidents are marginally or evenquestionably offensive, and inflexibile responsescan be more damaging than helpful. If, for exam-ple, someone repeats a slightly off-color joke heardon Seinfeld or Letterman, says something self-dep-recating about his or her group, or simply dis-cusses recent political scandals, some peoplemight take offense. A zero-tolerance policy wouldpreclude anything but a severe reaction, one thatcan seem disproportionate to the \"crime. \" There is no possibility of tailoring the response to the sever-ity of the incident. The second problem with zero-tolerance poli- cies arises from the first. If a zero-tolerance policyisn't enforced in a rigorous and literal way, because in some instances it leads to absurd overreactions,the policy as a whole is undermined. A policy, onceadopted, must be consistently applied. Anythingelse leads to greater legal exposure, because itopens the company to charges of picking andchoosing when to apply its own stated standard. A far better approach is to have the company 's response match the severity of the offense. If itmust be given a label, call it a \"Rapid Reaction \" policy. This policy should be explicit, transparent,and communicated clearly and frequently toemployees. If incidents arise, they should be dealtwith expeditiously and fairly, and there should bemechanisms in place to protect the rights of theperson making the accusation as well as dueprocess for the person being accused. Such a pol-icy should be based on principles of inclusivenessand sensitivity. But it should also presume thatemployees possess an inner fortitude and propor-tionality. Respecting diversity does not entail sur-rendering one 's judgment or good sense.There is a patchwork of laws gov- erning workplace discrimination.But at the federal level, three are central: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of1964 1prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national ori-gin; the Age Discrimination in Employ-ment Act (ADEA) 2prohibits employment discrimination based on the fact that theemployee (or job applicant) is 40 years orolder; Title I of the Americans with Dis-abilities Act (ADA) 3prohibits employment discrimination against qualified individu-als with a disability, \"who, with or with- out reasonable accommodation, can per-form the essential functions of theemployment position. \" (Two other laws, the Equal Pay Act of 1963 4and the Preg- nancy Discrimination Act of 1978,5are much less frequently invoked.) The first and third of these cover gov- ernment and private sector employershaving at least 15 employees; the second,at least 20 employees. In addition, moststates have laws that duplicate, reinforce,or extend the federal laws. The primaryaim of these laws is to ensure that allemployment-related decisions (e.g., hir-ing, promoting, and termination) aremade without regard to the employee 's (or applicant 's) status as a member of one or more of the protected classes. Illegal differential treatment is typically classified as being either intentional oradverse-impact. Intentional discrimina-tion occurs when the employer 's motive is discriminatory. Evidence of motive canbe direct: for example, when an applicantfor a truck driving position is told she will not get the job because of her gender.Evidence of discrimination can also beindirect, as when an individual in a pro-tected class is turned down, and subse-quently the employer hires some othernonminority applicant with lesser qualifi-cations. Adverse impact results from policy that has the effect of discriminating againstindividuals in a protected class even if theemployer 's reason for the different treat- ment is not based on protected status \u2014 unless the employer can prove that thepolicy is required by business necessityand is significantly related to the job 's requirements. An employer, for example,cannot require that all applicants for aloading dock position be young men. Itcan require that applicants regularly beable to lift 60 pounds, even if this policyresults in disparate treatment of femaleand elderly applicants. Height and weightstandards, fluency in English, arrest andconviction records, and so on, are allexamples of neutral criteria that havebeen found to have an illegal adverseimpact by the courts, when employershave proven unable to demonstrate thatthey are necessary for successfully per-forming the job. One notable exception to Title VII and the ADEA is the so-called bona fide occu-pational qualification (BFOQ). This excep-tion provides for those instances in whichit is an objective fact that members ofprotected classes cannot perform the jobin question. For example, a film director isallowed to cast only females for female leads; a Kosher delicatessen is allowed tohire only Jews to serve as butchers. Onthe other hand, an employer may notturn an applicant down because of cus-tomer preferences; for example, a beliefthat whites won 't buy from a black sales- man. (An interesting case now workingthrough the courts involves medical part-nerships that preferentially hire femalegynecologists, because, they say, moreand more women are requesting femaledoctors.) In 1977, a notable addition to the antidiscrimination laws occurred whenthe federal courts found sexual harass-ment a form of discrimination prohibitedunder Title VII of the 1964 Civil RightsAct. There are two principal forms thatsexual harassment can take. The first isthe \"quid pro quo, \" where submission to the sexual advances of a superior is a termof condition of employment. The secondis the so-called hostile work environment,where the employer 's offensive sexual conduct unreasonably interferes with thevictim 's job performance. Catalyst, a cor- porate women 's research group, says that 95 percent of harassment cases involve ahostile environment. (It is an urban myth,incidentally, that a single, unfortunateremark can lead to a successful lawsuit.Courts determine the psychologicalharm, severity, and frequency of theoffense, and whether it is physicallythreatening, before proceeding.) The Supreme Court has recently eluci- dated several steps employers can take proactively capitalize on the nation 's diversity, it must develop a broad range of policies and practices to helpensure that today 's workplace works for everyone. That is not to say, however, that individuals do not have an important role to play in successfully addressing diver-sity issues. This section examines some of the knowledge,skills, and abilities that firms should seek to inculcate intheir employees to further their success at managing diver-sity. These skills can be taught through training, orienta-tion, and development programs; they can be emphasizedin regular corporate communications; and they can beexemplified by actions that the firm and its leadershipundertake. They are not a substitute for other diversity measures (such as a minority contractor program), but theycan be an important complement to them. Perhaps the first quality firms should seek to develop and reward in their employees regarding diversity is theability to accept, and to be comfortable around, humandifferences. It may seem that this is too amorphous a qual-ity to foster, but that is not the case. Many of the day-to-day problems that arise from diversity come about becauseof the fears, anxieties, and tensions that people feel indealing with those who are different from themselves. It isthese emotions that hinder more relaxed social relations 68 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002Laws Governing Workplace Discriminationto prevent sexual harassment claims. First, they can develop and dissem- inate a written policy againstharassment. Second, they can institute an effec- tive complaint policy, with a mech-anism allowing employees tobypass the supervisors who may beharassing them. Third, they can investigate com- plaints quickly and thoroughly andtake appropriate disciplinaryaction. Fourth, they can provide anti-sex- ual harassment training to theiremployees, teaching them whatsexual harassment is and what todo if they believe that they arebeing harassed. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is the primaryagency tasked with enforcing thenation 's employment antidiscrimination laws. For years, it suffered from poormanagement and inadequate funding,resulting in a large backlog of cases, slowprocessing time, and poor customerservice. Its performance has improvedsignificantly over the past decade; how-ever, there is still considerable progressto be made. Most discrimination complaints allege one or more of the following kinds ofproblems: Isolated individuals acting without the sanction of the organization inways that are intentionally or sub-consciously prejudiced. This might be the case, for example, with asupervisor who denies an AsianAmerican woman a promotioninto management because shedoesn 't seem to him to be \"man- agement material. \" Small groups acting intentionally against members of a minoritygroup. This would be the case, forexample, if a group of coworkerswere harassing a gay colleaguewith the tacit approval of theirimmediate supervisor. The organization can establish practices that have a negativeimpact on certain groups, eventhough the practices are appar-ently neutral and were not createdwith any intent to discriminate.The courts tend to view these alle-gations with ambivalence. Finally, and most controversially, the organization can fail to takeaction to address one or more ofthese problems, as manifest bycontinuing disparities in outcomeamong different groups. Thisargument is by far the most com-mon in employment law becauseit assigns responsibility (and thusliability) to the organization ratherthan to individuals within it; at thesame time, it doesn 't rest on a finding that the company pursuedexplicitly discriminatory practices(after all, few organizations todayadopt such policies), but maintainsinstead that the company failed to take action that it should havetaken. It is no exaggeration to saythat much of employment law isconcerned with the two issuesraised by this sort of claim: theattribution and extent of liabilityfor acts of omission, and the con-ditions under which disparities canbe taken as evidence of discrimi-nation. Probably no other area of employ- ment law provokes quite as much con-cern as affirmative action. Intended toremedy present effects of past discrimina-tion, it was originally promoted by Presi-dents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon. 6 However, it has come under increasingcriticism for favoring certain groups at theexpense of others. Anti-affirmative actionmeasures have passed in California andelsewhere, and the Supreme Court, inseveral recent decisions, has imposedincreasingly greater limitations on affir-mative action programs. 7 1 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2 (1994). 2 Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 (1994). 3 Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (1994). 4 Equal Pay Act of 1963, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d)(1) (1994). 5 Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-(k) (1994). 6 Stephen Cahn, \"Stephen Cahn on the History of Affir- mative Action, \" 1995, accessed at aad.English.ucsb. edu/docss/Cahn.htm. 7 Michael Fletcher, \"Affirmative Action Tops NAACP List,\" The Washington Post , July 14, 1998, p. A3.among groups, and that can trigger or exacerbate conflict. The best way to alleviate these is to create an environmentin which the fact of human difference is acknowledgedand esteemed. E pluribus unum can be a corporate motto as well as a national one. This ethic needs to be woven intothe corporate culture, in everything from the art it placesin the entrance to the CEO 's communications to staff. A second trait companies should aim to foster in their employees is an understanding of the nature of prejudiceand discrimination. This needs to be done carefully if it isnot to backfire. Too often, in the past, white men weresimply accused of being prejudiced; if they tried to deny it,they were doubly accused, first of being prejudiced, and then of trying to cover it up. The result could feel like aSalem witch trial. There is a better way. Rather than trying to confront and expose the individual 's latent prejudices, the company should offer a simple, clear explanation of how prejudiceoperates and of the subtle ways that it may affect one 's judgment. This sort of presentation can be done in a train-ing session or as part of the new hire orientation. Itshouldn 't focus on accusation; it shouldn 't assume the worst of anyone. The goal should be to invite reflection:\"How might I be affected by these quite natural and unfor- Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 69CRtunately universal tendencies? \" There is no guarantee, of course, that those most in need of this sort of reflection willactually undertake it, but fostering a corporate culture inwhich the nature of prejudice and stereotyping are clearlyunderstood can go a long way toward eliminating them. A related trait that companies can promote is ambiguity tolerance. This psychological term refers to an ability to livewith uncertainty; to respond to ambiguous, complex, ormultifaceted situations and people without rushing to judg-ment. It 's what ordinary people call having an open mind. People who are close-minded experience ambiguous situa-tions as threatening. Feeling threatened, they respond withhostility toward the person provoking that uncertainty,even if that person hasn 't done anything to harm them. That is why we so often say of group hatred that it is \"irra- tional. \" The person doing the hating isn 't responding to any actual threat, but to the perception of a threat inducedby his or her own inability to deal with ambiguity. Again,this is not a skill that can be easily taught, in the way, for example, that one might train people in handling a new photocopy machine. But it is a trait that can be esteemed,\"talked up, \" made part of the corporate ethos, and demon- strated by example among the leadership. One other \"emotional skill \" that companies can foster is an appreciation for the challenges and difficulties thatother groups face, an ability to imaginatively project one-self into the shoes of another. When it is said of whites, orof men, for example, that they \"just don 't get it, \" what is being expressed is a frustration that they don 't appreciate the work involved in fitting into a culture dissimilar totheir own; the stress of being seen as a \"representative \" rather than as an individual; the effort to make others feelcomfortable; the need constantly to be on alert againstbehaving in ways that might be interpreted stereotypi-cally; and the wearying effects of rarely knowing howmuch race or gender are actually influencing the situa-tion. Is this store clerk being rude to me because I 'm black or because he 's unpleasant? (Whites may wonder the same if they receive bad service from blacks, but they visit farfewer black-owned or -managed businesses than blacksfrequent white-owned businesses.) Nor do members of the majority always understand the informal benefits thatcome from \"belonging, \" such as access to the grapevine or honest performance feedback. On the other hand, many women and minorities don 't understand how difficult that imaginative leap is. Becausethey experience discrimination daily, they don 't under- stand how the majority can fail to \"get it, \" and they wrongly conclude that this failure is a symptom of somedeeper dishonesty or deliberate decision. The fact is, how-ever, that most people understand only what they haveexperienced; what they haven 't experienced isn 't emotion- ally available to them. Here again, a non-threatening, non-judgmental educational approach is the wisest course. Toooften, in the past, the approach has been to berate themajority for their failure to \"get it \"; the impact on their consciousness has been temporary, at best. Far better toeducate through personal testimonials, stripped of rancor.Clear, honest accounts of the challenges and occasionalpain that are part of the daily experience for the many whoare not in the majority can deepen the consciousness ofthose who are far more than more aggressive approaches. Close cousin to this emotional understanding is a greater factual knowledge of the realities concerning raceand diversity. This knowledge can take three forms: First,a greater knowledge of the history and current realities ofgroups that are traditionally included under the rubric ofdiversity. A recent poll found that a large majority ofwhites believe that whites and blacks enjoy equalincomes, economic opportunities, and educational attain-ment. This might be said to represent a clear triumph ofignorance over prejudice. It means that most whites don 't believe that the majority of blacks are poor, welfare-prone,and so on. On the other hand, it also means that manywhites simply don 't know the facts about race today. Clearly, a deeper knowledge about the ongoing inequali-ties that mark relations between groups, and an awarenessof the demographic transformation now underway, canlead to a heightened appreciation for the need to proac-tively address these issues. Second, knowledge about the risks and benefits of diversity can generate a greater level of commitment tochange. The fact that there is a solid business case fordiversity can be a compelling argument to skeptics whoare unimpressed with the moral arguments for diversity. Third, anyone who works closely with people of another culture, race, gender, and so on, particularly in a manage-ment role, would do well to be attentive to them as indi-viduals. Susan Fiske, the Princeton psychologist, has notedthat powerful people pay less attention to subordinatesbecause they don 't depend on them, have other things on their mind, and may have a strong need to feel dominant.\"Stereotyping and power are mutually reinforcing, \" says Fiske, \"because stereotyping itself exerts control, maintain- ing and justifying the status quo. \" Thus, encouraging man- agers to be attentive to their subordinates as individuals 70 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002 The fact that there is a solid business case for diversity can be acompelling argument to skeptics who are unimpressed with themoral arguments fordiversity.can diminish a situational tendency to view them as (stereotypical) members of a group or category. The role of the organization in fostering a climate of respect and mutual consideration has been touched on atseveral points but needs to be made explicit. As Fiske haswritten, \"an organization can make certain values salient, can encourage the constructive sides of people 's self-con- cepts, can promote norms of fairness, and so on. Con-versely, an organization can ignore these issues and let thepowerful take the easy way out, not bothering to pay muchattention to the powerless. \" The importance of local or organizational norms is that they encourage or inhibit aclimate in which individuals can be harassed or discrimi-nated against. Harassment or discrimination is often asymptom of an organizational rather than an individualfailing. What may seem to majority managers to be inap-propriate and isolated behavior all too often feels to minor-ity and women employees like the visible tip of an icebergof discriminatory practices tacitly condoned from the top.That is one more reason why it is not enough to let theorganizational \"ship\" drift on matters related to diversity; it must be consciously steered away from the iceberg. Aside from valuing and modeling certain habits of the heart and mind, organizations can coach their employeeson a host of practical skills that will improve their diver-sity management. Most of these skills are part and parcelof good management techniques: Knowing how to listen,give feedback, foster constructive conflict, and mediatedisputes are not skills that are specific to managing diver-sity, but they are essential to it. Integrating diversity-related material into executive and management soft-skilltraining programs is a critical component of an overalldiversity program. If there is a single lesson underlying these prescriptions, it is that managing diversity well is not simply about race orgender or ethnicity; ultimately it is about managing peopleas if people mattered. Again and again, diversity managersat top companies stress a central message: A company 's greatest resource is its people. Managed humanely, giventhe chance to compete, \"the opportunity to be discovered \" in Carl Brooks ' memorable phrase, they will respond with dedication and loyalty. \"The secret is that it 's not just about blacks or women, \" says Brooks. \"It's also about the white man who maybe didn 't go to the right school, or who does- n't play golf, and who can remain undiscovered forever. If people feel like they have an opportunity, they 'll work. If not, they 'll go home every night at 5 pm. \" Fulfilling the Dream Does diversity only benefit those who are, in a sense, already \"in the game \"? Skeptics sometimes argue that cor- porate diversity won 't help the bottom quarter or quintile of people who have never learned the skills that corporateAmerica needs. Companies are, after all, in the business ofmaking money. Those who have been consigned to themargins of our society generally don 't make a particularly lucrative market or attractive labor force. Al Zollar, the general manager for IBM 's Lotus Software division, and as such one of America 's leading African Amer- ican high-tech executives, disagrees. \"I go to schools and ask the kids how much they think I make. They tell me $20,000or $25,000 year, because that 's what their expectations are. They don 't know that you can be an African American and make it. \" By giving young people an attainable vision of suc- cess, Zollar and other nontraditional executives give back totheir communities the most precious resource of all: Hope.\"Thanks to Martin Luther King and people of my father 's age, my generation has the opportunity to succeed in waysthat past generations could only dream about. We have anobligation to seize that opportunity, both to redeem the pastand to help forge a brighter future. \" References 1 If 100 classmates graduate from high school, of whom 90 are white, and 110 freshmen enter, of whom 95 are white, then the number ofnet entrants to the school is 10. Of these, five are white and five arenonwhite. (In other words, the school has five more whites than itdid, and five more nonwhites.) Thus, 50 percent of the net entrantsto the school are nonwhite, even though nearly 87 percent (95/110)of the entering class is white. The Hudson Institute 's 15 percent fig- ure simply represents a fact about the composition of the growth ofthe workforce, not about the workforce as a whole. 2 Some of the original reports about particularly offensive remarks attributed to Texaco officials turned out to be inaccurate. However,the overall thrust of the comments was certainly ill-advised. 3 Even the sexes sometimes seem to belong to different cultures.When the Tom Hanks character in \"A League of Their Own \" exclaimed \"There 's no crying in baseball! \" he was genuinely shocked that the women on his team were distraught that he was yelling at them. Themale ballplayers he had previously coached \"understood \" that a manager was supposed to yell at his players; they didn 't take it per- sonally. The women, on the other hand, interpreted the yellingthrough the lens of their own experience: If they were yelling atsomeone the way the Tom Hanks ' character was yelling at them, it would be because they were truly upset. Hanks ' character, for his part, interpreted crying as a sign of severe emotional distress andweakness. So both sides \"overinterpreted \" each other 's behavior in light of their own understanding of what was natural and proper tothe situation. 4 Equal Pay Act 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d)(1) (1994). 5 Mandatory arbitration programs have generated many com- plaints. The primary one is that the adjudicators are usually drawnfrom senior leadership in the industry, and so are not balanced byrace or gender. In its investigation of the securities industry, theU.S. Commission on Civil Rights found that 97 percent of thejudges on the arbitration panel pool were white men. Womenand minorities who are considering whether or not to file dis-crimination grievances must find that statistic rather daunting.For this reason and others, the Equal Employment OpportunityCommission generally discourages mandatory binding arbitrationas a condition of employment; increasingly, however, the courtsare finding such policies lawful. Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 71CRPerceived Legitimacy in the Struggle for Civil Rights Review of The Psychology of Legitimacy , edited by John Jost and Brenda Major Reviewed by Peter Glick and Susan T. Fiske To the extent that civil rights move- ments are battles for the hearts andminds of the public, they are conflictsabout the perceived legitimacy of oursocial institutions and laws. Politicaltheorists, including Machiavelli andMarx, have long recognized that per-ceptions of legitimacy \u2014what people perceive to be correct, proper, ormorally acceptable \u2014are critical to the maintenance of social and politicalhierarchies. Legitimization conspireswith psychological, social, political,and economic processes to supportestablished social hierarchies. The Psychology of Legitimacy , edited by John Jost and Brenda Major, collectsvaried perspectives on the social-psy-chological processes, among both theadvantaged and the disadvantaged,that shore up this wall around the sta-tus quo. Because we contributed achapter, this article is not intended tobe an objective, critical review, butrather to highlight the broader implica-tions of theories and research presentedin the book. (The researchers men-tioned below are either contributors tothe book or cited in it.) We will con-centrate here on one of the most dis-turbing aspects of the tendency to legit-imize \u2014how difficult it is to puncture the apparent legitimacy of a discrimi-natory social system, even amongthose who bear the burdens of disad-vantage and discrimination. Psychological theories of legitimacy examine what Jim Sidanius and hiscolleagues have termed \"legitimizing myths, \" the shared values, beliefs, and ideologies that justify social hierarchy.Legitimizing myths provide Pangloss-like rationalizations as to why, despiteobvious inequities, ours is the best ofall possible societies. As John Jost andhis colleagues note, such \"system-jus- tifying \" beliefs (that our society is good and fair) may either comple-ment or conflict with rationalizationseach of us uses to preserve esteem forourselves and for our groups (based onethnicity, gender, class, etc.). The pos-sible conflicts between these levels ofrationalization (self, group, society)differ for the privileged and the disad-vantaged. Legitimization Among the Privileged Happy are the privileged for whom jus- tifying the legitimacy of society simul-taneously fulfills the goals of flatteringthemselves and their groups. Successfulmembers of dominant social groupscan feel good about themselves, thegroups to which they belong, and theirsociety by embracing mutually rein-forcing beliefs in the legitimacy ofeach. For example, the system-justify-ing belief that American society is aperfect meritocracy provides individualand collective self-esteem for affluentwhites, confirming that their own andtheir group 's success is due to talent and effort, not group privilege. Byasserting the fairness and legitimacy ofsociety as a whole, these individualsalso reinforce positive self-images andgroup identifications. That the privileged typically support a discriminatory system surprises noone. Nor is this basic tenet of Marxistthought a new idea. What the psycho-logical perspective adds, however, is therealization that legitimizing beliefs arenot solely about maintaining eco-nomic advantage, going beyond pureMarxian views, nor are they merelycynical, deliberately Machiavellianattempts to placate the masses. Ratio-nalizations are truly effective onlywhen they deceive oneself as well asothers. The most powerful legitimizingideologies are sincerely held, unreflec-tively believed, and widely shared. For the privileged, the most attrac- tive rationalizations not only reinforcetheir economic and social advantage,but also fulfill the basic psychologicalneed to view themselves as both com- petent and morally good. Arguably,these psychological motivations are atleast as important to people as thepolitical and material self-interest thatMachiavelli and Marx claimed as thedriving forces behind ideological con-victions. Recognizing psychologicalmotives helps to explain behavior thatappears to contradict self-interest, butfulfills the need to feel morally correct.The revolutionary zeal of affluentreformers (Marx and Engels, after all,were members of the bourgeoisie) illus-trates how material self-interest cantake a backseat to a desire to be morallygood. In successful social movements,reformers have provoked (what Haber-mas termed) a \"legitimation crisis \" among members of the dominantsocial group. When most white Ameri-cans were led to realize that racial seg-regation contradicts American demo-cratic ideals \u2014central to the perceived moral goodness of American identity \u2014 attitudes changed. One's own and one 's group 's per- ceived morality, however, can all tooeasily reconcile with justifying hierar-chy and discrimination. Mary Jackmansuggests that paternalism appeals to theprivileged through a mental jui jitsu that transforms exploitation into benevolence, and dominance into serv-ice. Paternalistic legitimizing myths jus-tified 19th-century colonialism andslavery, by affirming white Europeanracial and cultural superiority whilesimultaneously defining, and by con-struing their actions toward \"inferior \" groups as benevolent rather thanexploitative (e.g., governing peoplewho were perceived as incapable ofgoverning themselves and ostensiblyintroducing culture and true religion to\"superstitious savages \"). Although the sensitivity of Ameri- cans to race relations has suppressedmore overtly paternalistic attitudestoward nonwhites (e.g., speaking of the\"white man 's burden \" has gone out of fashion), attitudes toward nonwhitesstill often contain an element of pater-nalistic pity. Overtly paternalistic atti-tudes toward people who are older, 72 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002BOOK REVIEWSphysically disabled, mentally disabled, and female have not been as thor-oughly challenged. Our own work(with Amy Cuddy and Jun Xu) showsthat these groups elicit mixed stereo-types of low competence and highwarmth, correlated with their low-sta-tus but noncompetitive social niche. Paternalism is both subjectively benevolent and effectively hostile. Onthe one hand, it evokes pity, whichleads to helping, and it justifies protec-tive legislation for groups perceived tobe weak. On the other hand, a fine lineseparates \"protecting \" and restricting. Opposition to the Equal Rights Amend-ment, for example, was framed as pro-tective (e.g., concerns about the draft). Our research on ambivalent sexism examines the role that \"benevolent sexism \" plays in legitimizing gender inequality. Benevolent sexism com-prises subjectively positive responses towomen that nevertheless presumethem to be the \"weaker sex, \" requiring men's protection and provision. Exam- ples of such beliefs include the ideasthat women ought to be set on apedestal, that women are more morallypure than men, and that womenrequire men 's protection. In a study of 19 nations, we found that wherebenevolently sexist attitudes wereendorsed, so too were hostile sexistbeliefs (that is, nations in which benev-olent sexism scores were high invari-ably also showed high hostile sexismscores). Furthermore, both types of sex-ism (hostile and benevolent) predictedstandard U.N. measures of nationalinequality between women and men(e.g., fewer women in top governmen-tal and business roles). In the contemporary U.S. political climate, women 's civil rights are attacked more effectively by those whoespouse a benevolently protective,rather than an overtly hostile, ideology.Hostile justifications (e.g., that womendo not possess leadership ability) arepolitically incorrect. In contrast,because of its affectionate, protectivetone, benevolent sexism is oftenembraced by women as well as men.And it manages to justify inequalitywhile also conferring a moral legitimacy on men as chivalrous, self-sacrificingprotectors (rather than exploiters) ofwomen. For dominants, paternalisticideologies avoid legitimization crises byjustifying their own superior status (andthe social practices that preserve it)while simultaneously asserting theirown benevolent moral goodness. Legitimization Among the Disadvantaged Members of disadvantaged groups have a more difficult time resolvingconflicts between the desires for self-esteem and belief in the fairness oftheir society. If members of low-statusgroups view society as just, their disad-vantaged position implies unflatteringviews of themselves and of their group.Social psychologists have discovered anumber of ways in which people solvethis conundrum. Unfortunately, manyof these solutions fail to challengesocial injustice. One psychological obstacle to ques- tioning the legitimacy of the social sys-tem is people 's desire to believe in a just\u2014even if cruel \u2014world. The motiva- tion to view the world as controllable isboth strong and basic, as Melvin Lernerfirst pointed out. Believing that peopleget what they deserve and deserve whatthey get maintains this sense of control,without which people risk feeling help-less and depressed. Members of disad-vantaged groups therefore face a diffi-cult psychological dilemma: believe inthe basic fairness of the world and viewtheir poor outcomes as deserved, or rec-ognize that society is unfair and riskfeeling helpless. Thus, Jost and his col-leagues propose that members of disad-vantaged groups face a legitimization crisis in which the desire to see theirsociety as fair conflicts with motivationsto view themselves and their group in apositive light. This dilemma can be resolved by viewing society as unjust, but mal-leable, and then joining collectivemovements for social change. But thedisadvantaged are less likely to bandtogether and work collectively forchange when a society allows for evenminimal social mobility (e.g.,tokenism). Stephen Wright has com-pared experimental conditions inwhich individuals are informed thatthey have been denied membership ina high-status group because membersof their participant 's group (based on the participant 's area of study at the university) were either (a) completelyrestricted or (b) allowed to form only 2percent of the high-status group 's membership. Participants were thengiven several options: take no action;take individual action (aimed at gettinginto the group without challenging thediscriminatory rules); or take collectiveaction (openly challenge the rules asunfair to members of their group). Inthe completely closed condition(where no \"social mobility \" was allowed), participants stronglyendorsed collective action. But whenthe high-status group was even slightlypermeable (accepting just 2 percentmembership from the participant 's group), individualistic action was pre-ferred and collective action became anunpopular choice. Wright 's results illustrate that collec- tive action is most likely in the face ofclear-cut discrimination that com-pletely closes off opportunities for theadvancement of specific social groups.Allowing even a token amount of socialmobility can diminish collective action;Wright empirically demonstrates howto co-opt the oppressed but talented.Thus, a system that promotes only afew members of disadvantaged groupsto tokens in high-status positions canhave unfortunate side effects \u2014when the success stories can coexist with con-tinuing disadvantages and a discrimina- Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 73BOOK REVIEWS PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORIES OF LEGITIMACY EXAMINE THE SHARED VALUES , BELIEFS , AND IDEOLOGIES THAT JUSTIFY SOCIAL HIERARCHY . tory system. Questioning the fairness of the society becomes less attractive tomembers of disadvantaged groups thando individual attempts to get aheadwithin the system. Furthermore, mem-bers of privileged groups can point tothe few prominent success stories tobolster their beliefs that the system isfair. Thus, ideologies such as the Protes-tant work ethic and tokenism not onlysoothe the consciences of the privi-leged, but (in a semi-permeable society)also puncture collective resistance bythe disadvantaged. Furthermore, individual members of oppressed groups who are successfultend themselves to buy into justifica-tions of the status quo. Havingachieved their success within the sys-tem, they have a stake in asserting itsfairness \u2014belief in meritocracy con- firms that their own success is welldeserved. Naomi Ellemers has foundthat successful women in male-domi-nated fields tend to distance them-selves from other women, viewingthemselves as different. Rather thanhelping other members of their sex,women who have succeeded in typi-cally male domains tend to view otherwomen stereotypically. What about those who are left behind? The famous Clark and Clarkstudies in the 1960s, which showedthat black African American childrenpreferred to play with white-skinned(not brown-skinned black) dolls, rein-forced the then-popular idea that self-hate was the inevitable outcome of dis-crimination. Newer research, however,shows that the self-esteem of ethnicminorities equals or exceeds that ofwhites and that black children nolonger prefer white dolls. This may, inpart, reflect an increase in minority self-esteem over the last 40 years. However,as Brenda Major and Toni Schmadernote, as researchers have probed moredeeply into minority self-esteem, theyhave discovered that members of dis-advantaged groups are quite adept atoften preserving individual and collec-tive self-esteem, but often at the steepprice of disengaging from domains inwhich their group tends to fare poorly.Unfortunately, for disadvantaged minorities these domains \u2014such as school \u2014may be precisely those that provide the best opportunity forupward mobility. In contrast to older notions of minor- ity self-hate, current research suggestscommon ground between the disadvan-taged and the advantaged \u2014everyone is motivated to develop a positive, distinc-tive identity. Being in an advantagedposition helps the privileged to basetheir individual and collective self-esteem on traits (e.g., competence andambition) and accomplishments (e.g.,education and high-status jobs) thatconsolidate their privilege. In contrast, lack of opportunity and discrimination hinder members of disadvantagedgroups from priding themselves on thetraits and achievements most valued bythe dominant society. Major and Schmader 's research has demonstrated that disillusionedAfrican American students devalue theimportance of academic feedback \u2014 when they suspect it may be raciallybiased \u2014so that failure at school does not threaten how they feel aboutthemselves. Protecting self-esteem inthis manner, however, decreases moti-vation to do well and promotes alien-ation from school (e.g., viewing schoolsuccess as \"acting white \"). This process is triggered by what Claude Steele hastermed \"stereotype threat \"\u2014the per- ception among members of stereo-typed groups that should they ever per-form poorly, others are all too ready toreduce them to a stereotype, to perceive them (negatively) as a \"typical \" mem- ber of their group. (Anybody can fallprey to stereotype threat in domainswhere their group is negatively stereo-typed, for example, white athletes com-paring themselves to black athletes.)Strikingly, stereotype threat endangersevery level of schooling for groupsstereotyped as academically weak. Eventhose individuals whose talent andeffort gain them admission to elite col-leges can fall prey to such anxieties ifthey perceive the school environmentas promoting stereotypical views oftheir group (as minority students oftenfeel at majority-white colleges). Fortu-nately, if schools build a sense of trust,they can diminish stereotype threatand performance gaps between stu-dents who are negatively academicallystereotyped and those who are not. Conclusion Legitimization conspires with psycho- logical, social, political, and economicprocesses to support established socialhierarchies. The Psychology of Legiti- macy , edited by Jost and Major, collects varied perspectives on the social-psy-chological processes, among both theadvantaged and the disadvantaged,that shore up this wall around the sta-tus quo. The varied perspectives pre-sented in The Psychology of Legitimacy can be usefully applied in many con- texts. We are not so much interested inpromoting a particular book as the use-ful ideas it represents. In legal settings,legitimization provides a theory of theprejudiced mind. In politics, legitimiza-tion explains change and stagnation.In social services, legitimization pro-vides a window for combating alien-ation. In diversity consulting, legit-imization provides an opportunity forexamining shared assumptions thatsupport the status quo. Perhaps knowl-edge in this case can truly empower.

Loury Reviewed by Christopher H. Foreman, Jr. In America 's cottage industry of writ- ing on race, a few nonfiction cate-gories predominate: history, biogra-phy, personal memoir, journalisticexpos \u00e9. But most stimulating and use- ful for raising the level of public dis-course are social science-based com-mentaries that aggressively invitesophisticated general readers to recon-sider what they know (or think theyknow) about the condition andprospects of African Americans. Exam-ples include recent work by sociologistOrlando Patterson, historians Stephanand Abigail Thernstrom, and politicalscientist Paul Sniderman. Whetherone remains optimistic or pessimisticabout America 's enduring racial prob- lems, we are indeed blessed with abroad spectrum of researchers andthinkers, from Thomas Sowell on theright to Lani Guinier and ChristopherEdley on the left, who remain eagerlyand productively focused on thisimportant intellectual work. Economist Glenn Loury offers us a fascinating new addition, this one pos-ing a direct challenge to the Thern-stroms ' impressively comprehensive and influential 1997 volume America in Black and White: One Nation, Indivisible . Once favored by conservatives for hiswillingness to question racial prefer-ences \u2014he was briefly considered for a political appointment in the Reaganadministration \u2014Loury 's arguments now place him closer to those \"racial liberals \" with whom he still has his dif- ferences. While Loury doubtless feelsstrongly about his subject, The Anatomy of Racial Inequality is a remarkable (if not in every respect fully persuasive) effort to reason rigorously. The presentation, though accessible to the general reader,is crafted to pass muster with profes-sional peers, who want to know notwhat Loury feels but what he candemonstrate. This concise volume, based on a series of lectures delivered atHarvard, is not easily sampled,skimmed, or summarized. It is never-theless well worth the effort itdemands. The reader will find no newdata but rather \"a novel conceptual framework for assimilating the evi-dence at hand. \" The argumentative style is partly deductive and frequentlyinterdisciplinary, though stronglyanchored (especially near the opening)in the economic analysis that is Loury 's intellectual home turf. Loury sets forth the core of his argu- ment in three chapters on racial stereo-typing, racial stigma, and racial justice.Quite early in the book, Loury beginslaying the groundwork for his positionthat \"taking race into account \" is not an invidious practice per se. Indeed,doing so turns out to be something of amoral imperative. He comes to thisconclusion even though he begins bypositing \"race\" as a construct grounded only in the simple (if universal) need ofhuman beings to organize, cope with,and gather information about theworld they find themselves in. But the\"body markings \" we construe as \"race\" are of importance to Loury (and to therest of us) as bearers of \"social mean- ing.\" These markings, he says, \"signify something of import within an histori-cal context. \" Loury is interested in the potential for stereotypes to be \"reasonable \" in the sense that they are \"self-confirm- ing.\" As human beings, we are both burdened by limited information aboutthe world around us and inclined tomake generalizations. More particu-larly, someone having limited informa-tion about \"marked \" persons may draw unwarranted inferences about individ-uals that are grounded in the general-ization. Persons about whom infer-ences have been made may then adjusttheir actions in ways that confirm thestereotype. Thus a sequence of mutu-ally supportive belief and behavioremerges. By way of example Louryposits an employer who, believing thatblack trainees are more likely than oth-ers to perform poorly, sets a lower tol-erance threshold for errors by suchtrainees. The black trainees, in turn, aremore likely than others to read thisemployer behavior as a disincentive toperform well. \"Knowing they are more likely to be fired if they make a few mis-takes, an outcome over which theycannot exert full control, more blackthan other workers may find that exert-ing high effort during the trainingperiod is, on net, a losing propositionfor them. \" They thus behave so as to confirm the expectations held of them. Loury offers additional examples: black automobile buyers and black stu-dents applying to professional schools.These \"thought experiments, \" as Loury presents them, likewise conclude withthe buyers and students behaving so asto confirm the expectations held ofthem. What is most interesting andpernicious here is that this dynamicmay be driven entirely by mutualexpectations rather than by the under-lying capacities of the parties to therelationship. Some readers may reasonably ask, however, whether the perverse patternsLoury presents are actually telling useverything we need to know. Mighteven the conscientious \"thought exper- imenter \" easily (however rig an Within theworld as Loury posits it, his logic seemsimpeccable. But what if inconvenientadditional facts (such as genuinelylower skill or motivation on the part ofhis hypothetical trainee) are present, asthey might indeed be in a real work-place? In that event, the negative out-come could not reasonably be held tostem entirely from the perverse stereo-typing dynamic Loury wants to illumi- Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 75BOOK REVIEWS LOURY IS INTERESTED IN THE POTENTIAL FOR STEREOTYPES TO BE \"REASONABLE \" IN THE SENSE THAT THEY ARE \"SELF-CONFIRMING .\"nate. (The notion that low teacher expectations induce low performanceis a familiar one in debates about edu-cation reform. But is this all we need toknow to raise minority test scores?) This reservation stated, however, Loury 's reasoning performs an impor- tant social and intellectual service byalerting us to the possibility that someunknown fraction of unwholesomeinteraction across the racial dividemight derive importantly from thekind of perverse expectations logic helays out. A theory that is not univer-sally applicable is not worthless.Indeed, Loury 's argument might prompt useful work on two fronts. Aca-demics might subject Loury 's argument to careful scrutiny, including hardempirical research. Meanwhile the restof us might profitably reconsider theroots of our own behavior regardingpersons bearing \"body markings \" other than our own, especially when that dif-ference is amplified by other disparitiesin social or organizational standing. But, if Loury is right, such reconsid- eration by ordinary people will beunusual, if not exceedingly rare. Explic-itly considering the possibility thatsuch a self-confirming feedback mech-anism could be unveiled and discred-ited, Loury believes this a tall order formost persons. Given the deeper realmof \"nonrational factors \u2014in particular, the taken for granted meanings thatmay be unreflectively associated withcertain racial markers \" in which their cognitive processes are anchored, suchdetached reflection may be unrealisticto expect. In theorizing about processes underlying . . . cognitiveacts,\" economist Loury may be on thin ice. (One anticipates that social psy-chologists will want to weigh in here.)But it is there that he must go to pursuethe next (and perhaps the most chal-lenging) part of his argument, whichcenters on the notion of racial stigma.While Loury 's discussion of stereotyp- ing centers on information , stigma is all about meaning . Bodily \"markings \" (or any visible characteristic of any personor thing, for that matter) may becomestrongly imbued with a significance and association. \"[T]he symbols we call 'race' have through time been infused with social meanings bearing on theidentity, the status, and the humanityof those who carry them. \" If this is so, the obvious charge to the racialreformer is to create new meaning, ifsuch a thing is possible. Loury antici-pates an equally obvious objectionfrom, if not the Thernstroms them-selves, then surely from readers familiarwith their recitation of survey evi-dence. Isn 't the social meaning of race changing (such a reader might ask) asreflected both in the long-term trenddata showing increased tolerance of blacks by whites and in the prolifera- tion of widely admired persons ofcolor? Loury 's insistence that probes of popular \"attitudes \" cannot capture what he 's getting at (i.e., \"meaning \") is a claim likely to generate some resist-ance. Empirically minded critics willinsist on knowing (and debating)whether one can observe and measure(as distinct from personal attitudes) \"an entrenched if inchoate presumption ofinferiority, of moral inadequacy, ofunfitness for intimacy, of intellectualincapacity, harbored by observingagents when they regard the race-marked subjects. \" One can see what Loury is getting at here: a reflexive,unquestioned \"us\" and \"them. \" (I believe I have detected such \"cogni- tions \" myself, from time to time, in persons who wouldn 't dream of behav- ing inhospitably, much less abrogatingmy rights. Yet I am relieved that it isnot my job to assay this terrain con- vincingly for others.) Where does all this take us as a pol- icy enterprise? For one thing, we gethere a new analytic vocabulary justify-ing an equal opportunity emphasis, adistinction between reward bias (under which \"productivity is rewarded differ- ently for members of distinct racialgroups \") and development bias (which makes \"opportunity to tivity . . . unequally themembers of distinct racial groups \"). For Loury the former is classic discrimina-tion, and worthy of less emphasis in ourracial discourse than the latter, whichlies more deeply embedded in a foun-dation shaped powerfully by stigma. Ifanti-black reward bias has declined, acrippling development bias lingers that,unfortunately, is anchored strongly inan informal, nongovernmental realmthat our political culture places largelyoff-limits to even determined efforts atsocial justice policy entrepreneurship.Loury 's analysis here calls to mind Pat- terson 's focus on informal social net- works as crucial channels for groupadvancement that are less viable amongblacks \u2014a collective disability justifying (for Patterson at least) affirmative action(at least for a limited time). Loury, by his own account, is adamant that he is not up to \"some over-theorized discourse in defense ofaffirmative action policies. \" In finding both liberal individualism and his owndiscipline 's analytic emphasis on atom- ized individuals wanting, Loury has farmore on his mind than the battle overdiversity in corporations and universi-ties. Rather, he suggests that since racematters as a profound and subtle gen-erator of inequality, so should it beallowed also to matter in the concep-tion and implementation of ameliora-tive policies. He is less interested in\"reaching beyond race \" (as Sniderman and his collaborators would have usdo) than in facing up to the socialfreight that racial \"markings \" force a significant slice of the American popu-lation to carry. For Loury the tenaciouspursuit of \"race-blindness \" may ironi- cally make us morally blind as well. 76 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002BOOK REVIEWS LOURY IS LESS INTERESTED IN\"REACHING BEYOND RACE,\" THAN FACING UP TO THE SOCIAL FREIGHT THAT RACIAL \"MARKINGS \" FORCE A SIGNIFICANT SLICE OF THEAMERICAN POPULATION TO CARRY .Distinguishing among policy imple- mentation, policy evaluation, and\"civic construction \" (the domain where \"we are building monuments, constructing public narratives, enact-ing rituals and . . . pursuing policiesthat have an inescapably expressive aswell as directly instrumental face \"), Loury argues that the race-blindness ofliberal individualism in the first andsecond realms is both \"ahistorical and sociologically na \u00efve.\" Only in the last, he believes, \"should some notion of race-blindness be elevated to the levelof fundamental principle. \" This is, of course, a startling policy stance from a scholar once so welcomein Republican-dominated salons. Forthose of us who have been readingLoury for a while, his alienation frommore \"conservative \" brands of think- ing about race is not news. He repeatsthe critique he launched in the Atlantic Monthly some four years ago against the Thernstroms ' America in Black and White . In the mid-1980s, political sci- entist Donald L. Horowitz coined thephrase \"the figment of the pigment \" to describe a mistaken belief in race andethnicity as fundamentally different.The Thernstroms approvingly cite thephrase in describing \"the myth that racial groups are sealed compartments,impervious to change. \" Loury says that the Thernstroms \"blame race-con- scious public policies for what they taketo be an excess of racial awarenessamong blacks, \" a view he thinks \"gets it exactly backward. \" For him \"it is the historical fact and the specific nature ofblacks ' racial otherness that causes affirmative action [for blacks] to be sofiercely contested . . . \" (Along the way Loury himself misstates the Thern-stroms ' argument. They don 't suggest that African Americans ' belief in the myth is the specific problem but ratherthat a widespread susceptibility to thisbelief is.) Loury also categorizes theThernstroms as \"conservatives, \" but that has always seemed to me a pecu-liar label for two old-fashioned IvyLeague liberals who happen to take askeptical stance toward affirmativeaction and certain delusional varietiesof black nationalism. Indeed America in Black and White explicitly attacks, in plain black and white, the conservativereluctance to \"acknowledge the ugli- ness of our racial history and the per-sistence of racism \" only two para- graphs before the Horowitz reference. On the whole, however, Loury serves us well by directing us toward\"the enigma of the stigma. \" He brings a keen and subtle mind to bear on a setof issues that sorely needs it. The Anatomy of Racial Inequality is thought- ful, provocative, and demanding (inboth the intellectual and politicalsense). It is sure to be at the center of allsophisticated discussions on race foryears to come. CHRISTOPHER H. F ORMAN , JR., IS PROFES - SOR IN THE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AT THEUNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND . The Future of Immigrant Children, and What it Meansfor the United States Review of Legacies: The Story of the Immigrant Second Generation and Ethnicities: Children of Immigrants in America by Alejandro Portes and Ruben G. Rumbaut Reviewed by Vivian Louie In the wake of large-scale immigration to the United States over the last 40years, immigrants and their childrentoday number 55 million persons, orone out of every five Americans. Theincorporation of immigrants and theirchildren has far-reaching implicationsfor our nation. One is the creation ofnew ethnic groups, concentrated inseveral states and metropolitan areas.Another has to do with the eventualtrajectories of these ethnic groups. Akey determinant of these trajectorieswill be the outcomes of the second-generation immigrant children whowere either born in the U.S. or camehere at an early enough age to belargely socialized here. How will theyfare in the United States? Will theyclimb the mobility ladder, fulfilling their parents ' aspirations for them, or will they fall down the ladder, perhapseven faring worse than their immi-grant parents? This is the central question underly- ing Alejandro Portes and Ruben G.Rumbaut 's exciting new book, Legacies: The Story of the Immigrant Second Gener-ation , and the answer, as they persua- sively argue, goes beyond matters ofimmigration. Indeed, the authors arguethat the story of the immigrant secondgeneration, specifically, its social andeconomic adaptation, can lead to twodramatically different national fates, inone case a nation revitalized by thenew ethnic mosaic, and in the other, anation downtrodden by an escalationin its social problems . Ethnicities , the companion volume to Legacies , speaks to a related question that has been thesubject of debate in political and publicpolicy arenas, namely, the role ofnationality or ethnicity in differentimmigrant and second-generation out-comes. In sum, the two volumes pro-vide a detailed rendering of the immi-grant second generation, includinghow ethnicity plays out in immigrantmobility, and in so doing, a possibleforecast of our nation 's future. If we look to the historical record, we see in an earlier wave of immigra-tion to the United States one possibleoutcome for the new second genera-tion. It is estimated that between 1880and 1924, 13.5 million south-central-eastern European immigrants landedon American shores. They came largelyfrom peasant, semi-literate back-grounds, had few skills, and their recep-tion in the United States was often vir-ulent discrimination combined withintense xenophobia, as they were com-pared unfavorably to the northwesternEuropean, Protestant migrants whohad come before them. Yet successivegenerations came to achieve socioeco-nomic mobility and were eventuallyincorporated into the nation 's social fabric, giving rise to the classic assimi-lation paradigm in the field of sociol-ogy, one in which mobility and inte-gration into mainstream American Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 77BOOK REVIEWSculture (e.g., white, middle-class, and of European, Protestant origins) wenthand in hand. Portes and Rumbaut, however, offer a very different picture of what couldhappen to the immigrant second gen-eration, one decidedly less optimistic.Some ethnic groups will indeed seetheir second generation follow the clas-sic assimilation paradigm, and quicklybecome incorporated into the Ameri-can mainstream. This trajectory iscause for optimism. Others, though,will see the second generation experi-ence downward assimilation, experi-encing the intense poverty and alien-ation from the mainstream that arecommonly associated with the Ameri-can underclass in response to the severeeconomic deterioration in many of ournation 's cities. If this scenario were to unfold, the urban underclass wouldnot only increase in sheer numbers butalso acquire a multiethnic character.This trajectory is cause for pessimism. In making this assessment, Portes and Rumbaut build on several richintellectual strands. One is their earlierwork, Immigrant America (1980), detail- ing where the new immigrants camefrom, the resources they brought withthem, and the different contexts ofreception they faced in the UnitedStates. Such contexts include how thegovernment treats the group, its incor-poration into the labor market, andwhether the group joins an alreadyexisting ethnic community. Another isan influential article written by sociolo-gist Herbert Gans, who envisioned thata significant portion of post-1965 sec-ond-generation immigrants might notfollow the classic assimilation para-digm, but rather would become alien-ated, jobless, and decline into poverty.Building on this vision, Portes and soci-ologist Min Zhou argue that the chil-dren of post-1965 immigrants areassimilating into different segments of society, with divergent outlooks onschooling and socioeconomic out-comes. Two groups are able to achieveupward mobility \u2014those children who assimilate into majority culture, andthose children who are able to drawupon strong ethnic communities and develop strong ethnic attachmentsalong with positive outlooks on school-ing. A third group of children whoexperience discrimination and settlenear native-born minority groups instruggling neighborhoods adopt nega-tive outlooks on schooling and assimi-late into urban poverty. This previous work on immigration left us with three important questionsthat could be traced both to the demo-graphic profile of recent immigrantsand to the American economy that is receiving them. First is the issue of race. Most of the post-1960 immigrants havebeen from Latin America, Asia, and theCaribbean, and are nonwhite. Whatrole will the racial hierarchy in theUnited States play in structuring theoutcomes of their second-generationchildren? A second key developmenthas been the increasing importance ofeducational credentials in the U.S.labor market. We know from sociolo-gist William Julius Wilson and econo-mist Richard J. Murnane and othersthat the American economy no longerprovides well-paid manufacturing jobsto persons with low levels of education(as was the case during the earlierperiod of European immigration to theUnited States). Instead, the second-gen-eration children will be joining anhour-glass economy sharply divided between well-paid employment for thehighly educated and highly skilled, andconversely, low-paid jobs for unskilledworkers with low levels of education,with few opportunities in between.Will the second-generation childrenacquire the necessary education to jointhe top segment of the economy? Thethird crucial development has been theemergence of an American urban pop-ulation living in neighborhoods devas-tated by the dual effects of industrialrestructuring and middle-class flightthat have left them largely isolated anddevoid of institutional support andsocial organization. Some immigrantshave settled near or in these neighbor-hoods, where residents try to cope witha frayed economic fabric of scarce jobopportunities and poverty, and a socialfabric of drugs and violence. The resi-dents are often the descendants of ear-lier black migrants from the AmericanSouth, and migrants from Puerto Ricoand Mexico, who came to the urbancenters in search of better lives forthemselves and their children. Will thenew second generation find theirhopes and opportunities similarlydiminished? Legacies provides a strong empirical basis for exploring these questions. Thebook draws from the Children ofImmigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS)based in Miami and San Diego, twosites that have been gateway cities forthe post-1960 immigration to theUnited States. In Miami, the focus wasthe children of immigrants from Cuba,Haiti, the Dominican Republic,Jamaica, and other islands in the Eng-lish-speaking West Indies, CentralAmerica, and South America. In SanDiego, the focus was the children ofimmigrants from Mexico, El Salvador,Guatemala, the Philippines, Vietnam,Cambodia, Laos, and East Asia (China,Japan, and Korea). The CILS student sample included schoolchildren from the ages of 13 to17, with a mean age of 14, thus allow-ing the authors to target children whohad not yet dropped out of school. Thechildren had to have at least one for- 78 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002BOOK REVIEWS THE STORY OF THE IMMIGRANT SECOND GENERATION CAN LEAD TO TWO DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT NATIONAL FATES : IN ONE CASE , A NATION REVITALIZED BY THE NEW ETHNIC MOSAIC , AND IN THE OTHER , A NATION DOWNTRODDEN BY ITS SOCIAL PROBLEMS . eign-born parent, and were either born in the United States or had lived in theU.S. for at least five years. Two surveyswere administered, the first to a sampleof 5,262 students when they were inthe eighth and ninth grades, and thesecond when they were in their lastyear of high school, or had already leftschool. Interviews were also conductedwith 120 parents in 1992, followed by asurvey of 2,442 parents in 1995. Thequantitative analyses provide richexplanatory power, balanced by vividlife histories of immigrants and theirAmerican-born-and-raised children. One key finding is that regardless of nationality and socioeconomic back-ground, immigrant parents share highlevels of optimism for their children 's futures in the United States. Yet despitethis optimism, there is a gap betweenwhat parents hope for, and how theirchildren are presently faring. On theone hand, parental optimism translatesinto an achievement drive on the partof their children. For some children,though, there emerges an eventual dis-juncture between these high aspira-tions and actual outcomes. As Portesand Rumbaut tell it, this disjuncturecomes from several sources. One isindividual characteristics like the kindsof financial and educational resourcesthat immigrant parents themselveshave and bring with them, which canshape their children 's paths; or whether the immigrant family can provide thestabilizing influence of two parents, asopposed to a single parent. Portes and Rumbaut further argue that the gap derives from the immi-grant group 's mode of incorporation, or a set of external conditions that laywithin the realm of public policy. Howthe government receives an immigrantgroup, for example, can play an impor-tant role in shaping the group 's out- comes. Portes and Rumbaut point tothe example of Nicaraguans in Miami,a group with relatively high levels ofeducation that could have allowedthem to climb the American mobilityladder. Unfortunately, their claims forpolitical asylum and assistance havebeen routinely denied, resulting in anuncertain legal status that makes it dif- ficult for Nicaraguans to convert theireducation into an economic toehold.Rather, they must settle for menial jobsthat leave them unable to transmitadvantages to their children. In apoignant example, a young Nicaraguandaughter, an excellent student,expresses her hopes of attending col-lege. In this, she is supported by hermother, who worked for an insurancecompany in Nicaragua, and hermother 's partner, who had his own farm in their native country. But wait-ing on tables and delivering pizzas, thejobs her mother and partner have beenable to get in the United States, do notpay enough to fund a college tuition,and due to their uncertain legal status,the daughter would not qualify for anykind of financial assistance. The American social context comes to the fore as another critical externalfactor. Immigrant parents maintain adual vision of the United States: a placewith abundant opportunities for theirchildren, but also a place where youthgangs, drugs, and lax cultural normsabout parenting undermine theirattempts to help children take advan-tage of those opportunities. It is whatPortes and Rumbaut term \"the Janus- faced nature of American society:unmatched educational and economicopportunities coupled with constantmultiple threats to family cohesion andindividual survival. \" The challenge is particularly acute for working-class par-ents whose abilities to monitor theirchildren are undercut by their lack offinancial resources. They cannot moveto safer neighborhoods where gangs donot beckon, enroll their children in bet-ter and safer schools, and disciplinetheir children in ways that they aremost familiar with. A Dominicanfather speaks of his attempts to disci-pline his 13-year-old son through phys-ical punishment, as parents might doin his native land, and how his Ameri-canized son responds \u2014with a call to 911, reporting his father for childabuse. In this family, the solution wasto send the son back to the DominicanRepublic for his schooling and a dose offamily discipline, a tactic the father believes saved his son from gang life. In the minds of immigrant parents, Americanization brings with it negativeconnotations that can endanger theirchildren 's futures. Indeed, Portes and Rumbaut find that immigrant childrenwho have been in the United Stateslonger have higher reading scores (indi-cating their growing facility with theEnglish language) but lower gradepoint averages. With the passage oftime, the immigrant drive for academicachievement begins to wane as accul-turation sets in. There is also the crucial matter of race. While the educational and finan-cial resources that immigrants bringwith them matter, race plays a key rolein how immigrants can capitalize onthose resources in the United States,and thus, the extent to which they canpass on advantages to their children.Given that they are either born in theUnited States or have grown up here,second-generation immigrant childrenconfront an additional set of issues cen-tered on race, namely how they self-identify and how others see them. Asthey are inserted into the Americanracial hierarchy, immigrant childrenbegin to see themselves as part of exter-nally constructed racial groupings, andsome racialize their national origins inways that their parents could not evenimagine, while others must negotiateimmigrant and racial identities thatcan be at odds with one another. In one telling example, the daughter of Trinidadian professionals con-sciously adopted the speech patterns ofher African American peers in schoolin an attempt to fit in. Yet, outside ofschool, she found herself followed bystore clerks and the object of curt inter-actions with whites on the basis of herrace. In an attempt to get better treat-ment, she learns to telegraph herTrinidadian or West Indian identity bytrying to reclaim the \"island accent \" of her parents ' homeland. Here, the historical record provides another interesting comparison. Theearlier wave of south-central-easternEuropean immigrants was classified as Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 79BOOK REVIEWSbeing of different racial stock (and harshly discriminated against as aresult). Looking back, we may find thisdifficult to envision since their descen-dants have long gained acceptance aswhites, and in fact, lay claim to anoptional ethnicity. We know from thework of sociologist Mary Waters, forexample, that a third-generation ItalianAmerican largely gets to choosewhether to be identified as Italian; it isnot an identity imposed on that per-son by others. It is unclear, however,whether this new second generation ofWest Indians, Dominicans, Mexicans,and Vietnamese, and their children willhave such flexibility, or whether theywill continue to have racialized ethnicidentities imposed on them by others,and occupy a lower rung in thenation 's racial hierarchy. In Ethnicities , Portes and Rumbaut move to consider another importantquestion that has fuelled much of theimmigration debate, that is, the role ofnationality and ethnicity in shapingdifferent outcomes among immigrantgroups. As they point out, analyses ofCILS data consistently point to nation-ality or ethnicity \"as a strong or signif- icant predictor of virtually every adap-tation outcome. \" The important question is why. Political conservativescertainly have provided one answer,long touting the extraordinary successof Asian groups (as compared withLatinos, for example), and West Indi-ans (as compared with African Ameri-cans). According to this line ofthought, which finds some support inthe American public, superior culturalresources are the key reason why someimmigrant groups are able to fare bet-ter than others. The scholars assembled to analyze the CILS dataset and draw upon theirown expertise, however, draw a verydifferent kind of conclusion. In fact,individual resources recede in impor-tance, in comparison to how socialstructures incorporate the immigrants. The story is not of individual ambition,or even skills, but one of \"constraints and opportunities \" created by these social structures. Portes and Rumbautpersuasively argue that this dynamic plays out differently among the variousnationalities, \"forging distinct but undeniably American personalities andoutlooks. \" Portes and Rumbaut cull from these analyses to detail three pos-sible paths of assimilation that high-light how a group 's interaction with social structures has a decisive impacton its outcomes. In one scenario, immigrant groups arriving with high levels of educationand skills meet with a neutral or favor-able context of reception. As a result,they are able to parlay their advantagein the economy, join the middle class,and provide their children with the benefits that come with this status. Fil- ipinos would be one example of thistype of assimilation. In the second sce-nario, the key is a context of receptionthat allows for the development ofethnic communities with strong eco-nomic opportunities. Two groups thatcame to the United States as refugees,the first wave of Cuban exiles to Miamiand the Vietnamese, would be exam-ples of this pathway. The U.S. govern-ment provided crucial assistance thatallowed for families and communitiesto be reconstituted, along with strongethnic networks. Thus, while theimmigrant groups may not have highlevels of education or skills, they dohave access to the opportunity to buildsmall businesses in these ethnicenclaves and capitalize on their ethnicnetworks to support the education ofthe second generation. In the third scenario, immigrant groups with few skills, or in some cases,even the highly skilled, meet with anegative context of reception. For theseimmigrant groups, there is no chanceof obtaining good jobs in the main-stream economy; there is no availablegovernment policy of assistance; andthere is no pre-existing ethnic commu-nity with strong support systems readyto receive them. Rather, these immi-grant groups settle near or in alreadydisenfranchised minority communitiesand experience persistent labor marketand social discrimination. Their precar-ious economic and social position inthe United States only heightens thestresses that underlie immigrant adap-tation. and Haitians experi-ence type of assimilation, alongwith Nicaraguans, who tend to havehigher levels of professionalization,which they cannot capitalize onbecause of their uncertain legal status.West Indian immigrants are interestingbecause they face a similar kind of dis-crimination, but the effects are medi-ated, in part, by their skills and highlevels of education, English languagefacility, and attempts to retain theirimmigrant culture. These pathways to assimilation for the immigrant generation and theirchildren prove to be a compellingargument for seeing group outcomesas embedded in structural factors atvarious levels. In effect, Portes andRumbaut 's two volumes present a per- suasive and empirically robust argu-ment against the idea that certaingroups are culturally positioned to dobetter than others. In their policy recommendations, Portes and Rumbaut focus on educa-tion and the role of language acquisi-tion. They make the case that immi-grant children should learn bothEnglish and their parents ' native lan- guage in school, and in fact, becomefluent in both. Such bilingualism willthen lead to high academic outcomes,a better relationship with parents, andpresumably, mobility. This prescriptionis very different from what they con-tend actually occurs in the public 80 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002BOOK REVIEWS IF HIGHER EDUCATION HAS BECOME THE TICKET TO AMERICAN MOBILITY , THEN IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN HAVE SOME KIND OF EQUITABLE ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION .school system, where bilingual educa- tion has become synonymous with\"temporary instruction in a foreign lan- guage for children unable to speak Eng-lish.\" In the authors ' view, the current attempt to quickly mainstream immi-grant children plays out to deleteriouseffects: some children not only losemost of their foreign language facility,but they end up with limited Englishskills as well. Even those children whobecome adept at the English languagestill lose out in a global economy,where speaking several languages hasbecome ever important. Their point onlanguage is well taken, even though theAsian groups in the study appear to bean interesting exception to their the-ory. The Asians rapidly lose theirparental language and yet do extremelywell in school, while some of theLatino groups are much more likely tomaintain Spanish language facility butdo not fare as well in school. With their educational policy pre- scriptions ,Portes and Rumbaut provide an important window into how tomeet the challenges facing immigrantchildren in the public school system.The stakes are high. As Portes and Rum-baut point out, these immigrant chil-dren have a single lifetime to matchthe educational credentials that thedescendants of earlier European immi-grants had several generations toacquire. This \"fast-forwarding \" of the educational trajectory is required forthe new second generation to make itin the new American economy. Immigrant status, however, may only be one layer of the compellingeducational issues that demand ourattention. Policies developed for immi-grant children attending poor, urbanschools might also need to address thechallenges found among all childrenattending these schools, both immi-grant and native-born groups, particu-larly minorities. There will likely besome divergence between the twogroups in matters of importance, espe-cially when it comes to language issuesand socio-cultural adjustment for immi-grants. But in other important respects,there is much overlap. After all, bothnative-born and immigrant children are attending the same urban schools besetby disinvestment, gangs, and concernsabout general safety. If higher educationhas indeed become the ticket to Ameri-can mobility, then it is our responsibil-ity to ensure that children have somekind of equitable access to higher edu-cation. The question then becomes,how can we improve the opportunityof all children to learn in publicschools? For example, we might con-sider if there is any way to replicate thestrong optimism of immigrant childrenamong the children of long-termminority groups. Or does the relation-ship go only one way, with immigrantchildren acculturating into a decline inachievement motivation? And here, the dynamics of race and ethnicity that Portes and Rumbautelaborate on so gracefully elsewhereneed to be taken into account. Howdo race and ethnicity shape children 's experiences with education, particu-larly in middle and high school, thetime when their performance struc-tures access to higher education? Race,as Portes and Rumbaut and otherscholars have shown us, still has apowerful impact on how Americansare treated and viewed. If that is thecase, what is the role of teachers ' and peer group perceptions and academicexpectations for different racial andethnic groups, for both immigrantand native-born children, and whateffect do these expectations have? Itmight also be useful to examine if andhow schools as social institutions per-petuate or challenge racial, ethnic,and class stratification, with an eyetowards school tracking and funding.A look at these types of issues mighthelp us explain why some of theAsians in Legacies were faring better than some of the Latinos, despite theirdifferent language patterns. Other researchers have been addressing these areas in ongoing proj-ects that, along with the contributionsmade by Portes and Rumbaut, willdeepen our understanding of thisimportant population. One of theseprojects is the Longitudinal ImmigrantStudent Adaptation Study (LISA) based at the Harvard Graduate School of Edu-cation. In this study, Marcelo and Car-ola Suarez-Orozco are examining howimmigrant students and their parentsengage with education over a period offive years. The students, who were firstcontacted when they were between theages of 9 to 14, are in many ways theyounger counterparts to the adoles-cents who were the core of Legacies . The LISA study further extends the lineof inquiry by observing how childreninteract in their schools, communities,and homes, and assessing their lan-guage ability and achievement throughindividually administered instruments.The latter will provide a welcome checkon self-reported data on the part of stu-dents or parents, as well as data releasedby the schools. The Immigrant Second Generation in Metropolitan New York based at theCity University of New York GraduateCenter is a project that promises toshed light on second-generationadults. Two sociologists, Mary Watersand Philip Kasinitz, and a political sci-entist, John Mollenkopf, are investi-gating the second generation 's educa- tional, economic, political, andcultural lives. In a sense, then, the Sec-ond Generation project will give us anidea of where the children in Legacies may end up. Additional strengths of this study are that it includes native-born groups (e.g., whites, AfricanAmericans, and Puerto Ricans) as acomparative frame for the immigrantexperience and an ethnographic com-ponent that studies the second gener-ation in diverse social settings such asa community college, the church, anda labor union. There is a tendency in the United States to see immigrants as occupying aseparate space, both physically andsymbolically. They come from placesthat seem far away, and in some cases,are literally so. Some arrive in mysteri-ous ways, under the cover of night, orthrough smugglers preying on theirhopes for a better life. Once in theUnited States, they negotiate a Byzan-tine bureaucracy for green cards, legal Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 81BOOK REVIEWSpapers, matters that non-immigrants do not often understand too well. Inthe public mind, immigrants are here,but they are not of here. While theirpresence is embodied in the clothes wewear, the fruits and vegetables we eat,and at the other end of the spectrum,the medical care and computer chipsto which we have access, they oftenseem to be invisible. And when they dobecome visible, they are often framedas a problem that can be managed bylaws restricting their entry. What weare left with in Legacies is how incom- plete that picture is. The story of immi-grant children has deep implicationsfor the rest of us. On their shouldersmay rest the health of some of ournation 's cities, as they become, in terms of their sheer numbers, our economicand political bulwark in future years.The story of the second generation is ina sense, then, our story, and it is up tous what the ending will be. DR. VIVIAN LOUIE IS A HARVARD FELLOW ON RACE , CULTURE , AND EDUCATION AT THEHARVARD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION . Why the Poor Stay Poor Review of The Color of Opportunity: Pathways to Family, Welfare, andWork by Haya Stier and Marta Tienda Reviewed by Roger Waldinger The affluent society discovered the other America more than four decadesago. Ever since, the United States hasbeen locked in debate over povertyand its possible causes and cures. Forthose who have been paying atten-tion, the controversy is not only end-less, but never quite seems to change.In the vision lying behind the war onpoverty, the problem lay in the condi-tions that the poor encountered:change their circumstances, throughjob creation and training, and Amer-ica's impoverished would seize the chance, moving ahead on their own.But in an echo of the old distinction between poor of the deserving andundeserving kind, some commenta-tors insisted that the problem wasrooted in the behavior and outlook ofthe poor themselves. Diminishing thepenalties associated with povertywould do more harm than good:unless pushed to mend their ways,those who had internalized the \"cul- ture of poverty \" would be unlikely to change. Of course, the poverty debate was not just about the poor; it was alsoimplicitly, often explicitly, about race.It was one thing to learn that povertypersisted in the hollows of Appalachia;quite another, it appeared, to be toldthat poverty afflicted a disproportion-ate number of African Americans, andeven more so, those who lived in andaround cities. Needless to say, argu-ments about the \"culture of poverty \" took on an entirely different tonewhen the poor people in question alsoturned out to be black. In policy terms, it takes no score- card to know who 's won the debate, as the name of our last major piece ofwelfare reform \u2014\"Personality Respon- sibility Act \"\u2014tells it all. But outside the corridors of Congress, the discus-sion, albeit in muted terms, burbleson. For the moment, it may all havean academic feel, as the tide that roseduring the 1990s eventually liftedmany boats. But the ways of the econ-omy often prove fickle: should Amer-ica slip into a serious recession, thenthe fortunes of the poor may take asignificant turn for a worse \u2014but this time, with much thinner a safety netthan before. In that case, the continu-ing considerations of experts will turnout to be relevant, assuming, ofcourse, that anyone in power cares toask for their advice. As it happens, the experts really do have something to say. While ideologyhasn 't disappeared from the halls of academe, contemporary scholars havetaken the pains to learn from theirmistakes of their predecessors. They 've also moved well beyond earlier, moresimplistic formulations of the prob-lem, understanding that the phenom- enon is multidimensional, and itscauses complex. Any number of fac-tors increase the risk of falling intopoverty: residing in central cities; lack-ing the educational credentials thatemployers want; having grown uppoor; starting out life without two par-ents; membership in a group for whichsome white Americans might haveconsiderable distaste, or, from a differ-ent point of view, that might have apreference for idleness over work. Butthe analytic difficulty derives from thefact that, in reality, these features areusually bundled together; the questionis how to unpack the relationship, andthen specify how one factor influencesthe next. This is the agenda tackled by Stier and Tienda in their ambitious andimportant new book. To understandpoverty, they argue, one needs toidentify the routes by which peoplefall into that state. Events in an indi-vidual 's life \u2014a failure to finish high school; a teenage pregnancy; forminga family without marriage \u2014make impoverishment a likely fate, at leastfor some period of time. But theseevents often occur in a context overwhich the individual has little control:after all, one doesn 't choose one 's own parents. Growing up in a poor house-hold or one where there 's only one parent increases all of the subsequentrisk factors. And one misstep in theearly stage of adult life and long-termtrouble follows: you don 't finish high school, and it 's hard to get an ade- quate, stable job, producing an erraticwork record that persistently makesyou an unattractive recruit. Stier and Tienda take this perspec- tive and apply it to a set of data that is uniquely suited to explore theirconcerns. Poverty seems most in-tractable, and politically most explo-sive, in its big-city form. It is in thatsetting that Stier and Tienda find theirmost basic raw materials, drawing onWilliam Julius Wilson 's Urban Poverty and Family Life Study, a survey of2,490 residents of poor neighborhoodsin Chicago. Since poor neighborhoods 82 Civil Rights Journal / Winter 2002BOOK REVIEWShouse people of varying class back- grounds, that design choice is crucial,ensuring that the survey takes in thecomfortably middle class, along withthose Chicagoans living in circum-stances that are the bleakest of thebleak. Design as well as the choice ofplace yield another axis of variation, asChicago represents the emergingshape of American life, containing notjust black and white, but sizeable pop-ulations originating in Puerto Rico andMexico as well. To widen the focus andhighlight any factors that might makeChicago a special, rather than exem-plary case, Stier and Tienda bring in alarge-scale, contemporaneous sampleof urban residents nationwide. Thetwo surveys provide a neat parallel, asboth use current as well as retrospec-tive data, allowing Stier and Tienda totrace the pathways by which earlierevents led to the life course that theirrespondents eventually followed. Armed with the right raw materials, Stier and Tienda then crunch the num-bers. They provide devotees of thequantitative arts with supporting evi-dence in the form they like, but do soin appendices, allowing graphs andwords to do most of the work in thetext. And while careful writing aboutnumbers is never an easy task, Stier andTienda deliver the message in a clear,straightforward, and readily compre-hensible way. Put simply, perhaps simplistically, the story they tell is one in which trou-bles, once encountered, rarely go away.Start out in a poor, broken family and aparent with little education, and one isat significant risk of not finishing highschool by the time one turns 19. Thesame factors increase the likelihood ofhaving a child out of wedlock, towhich one now adds the liability asso-ciated with failure to get the highschool degree. Likewise for the possibil-ity of recent welfare utilization, wherethe long hand of the past often leadspersons brought up in households withan extensive history of welfare utiliza-tion to repeat the pattern as adults. Thesame set of problems makes it harder toget a job, with employment difficultiesat any one point in time compounded by earlier failures to develop the rightwork history. With few exceptions, it 's all much harder in Chicago, where deindustrial-ization has destroyed the job market forthe low-skilled and hypersegregationhas left black Chicagoans severely iso-lated from everyone else, to follow theanalyses of William Julius Wilson andDouglas Massey. Chicago is just a badplace to get started: as compared withother urban residents, Chicagoans are more likely to have dropped out of high school; unlike the pattern nationwide,growing up with one or two parentsmakes little difference in this regard.Teen parenthood without marriage isalso much likelier in Chicago than inother urban places; once again, the localeffect of structure in the family of originproves much weaker, especially formen. And finding a job is tougher inChicago than elsewhere, where job-holding experience has a weaker payoffthan in other big cities, and womenwho've been out of work have virtually no chance of finding an employer will-ing to put them on a payroll. But the politics of poverty, and of poverty research, have been especiallypolarized by their intersection with thepolitics of race. For that reason, Stierand Tienda 's lessons regarding inter- group differences are sure to garner par-ticular attention: in their study, theeffects of ethnic or racial group mem-bership largely disappear once one hascontrolled for disparities in early lifeexperiences. On only one count doblacks appear clearly different fromwhites, even after taking into account background experiences and circum-stances. Whether in Chicago or else-where, whether men or women, a birthoutside marriage was far likelier tooccur among African American respon-dents than among whites. In Chicago,black men and women were also morelikely to report recent welfare use thanwere whites, even after differences infamily structure, past and present, oreducation had been set aside. But as nosuch disparity emerged in the nationalsample, or even among a subsample ofpoor urban women, Stier and Tiendaconclude that the Chicago resultsreveal something distinctive about theWindy City \u2014namely its high level of racial segregation \u2014and not an attrib- ute characteristic of the black popula-tion nationwide. And as regards theother outcomes of interest \u2014dropping out of high school and participating inthe labor force \u2014Stier and Tienda find that blacks don 't differ from whites at all, once the analysis has controlled forearlier life experiences. All of which is notto say that other intergroup differences don 't matter. Like other major metros, Chicago 's minority population is taking anincreasingly Hispanic tilt. The twoLatino groups studied by Stier andTienda \u2014Mexicans and Puerto Ricans \u2014don't look like blacks or whites; nor do they appear identical toone another. Stier and Tienda 's picture of the conditions experienced byPuerto Ricans does not look particu-larly pretty. Accepted as labor migrantsa half century ago, the Puerto Ricanshave long since worn out whatever lit-tle welcome they then received. InChicago, they fall into trouble, relativeto comparable native whites, on sev-eral counts \u2014high school completion, out-of-wedlock births, and welfareusage \u2014a pattern that 's especially dis- tressing since each source of disadvan-tage brings on another. The Mexicans provide a rather dif- ferent story, at least for now. Stier andTienda 's data show that members of this group are much likelier thanwhites to drop out of high school \u2014 Winter 2002 / Civil Rights Journal 83BOOK REVIEWS SHOULD AMERICA SLIP INTO A SERIOUS RECESSION , THEN THE FORTUNES OF THE POOR MAY TAKE A SIGNIFICANT TURN FOR THE WORSE \u2014BUT WITH A MUCH THINNER SAFETY NET THAN BEFORE .though as Chicago 's Mexicans are a mainly foreign-born population, com-ing from a country where school usu-ally ends after grade 7, it 's probably more accurate to say that they neverdropped in. This liability notwith-standing, few other sources of troubleappear: Mexican men and women areno more likely than whites to becomeparents out of wedlock; by contrast,Mexican women are more likely thanwhites to become parents throughmarriage. Furthermore, Mexican menand women are less likely than com-parable whites to experience recent useof welfare. That the Mexicans shouldlook so distinctive is not difficult tounderstand: after all, one doesn 't get to el norte without kin and friends, already in place and who are preparedto help out. The network also connectsMexicans to more cohesive inner-cityneighborhoods, which turn out to bedifferent places than the severelyimpoverished neighborhoods inwhich many blacks live. And Stier andTienda provide enough evidence tokeep Pollyanna still: contrasted tocomparable whites in poor neighbor-hoods, the Mexicans are doing OK. Butthen again, they 're not quite compara- ble, as the Mexicans have such lowskills, for which they pay considerablepenalty in the low wages they earn. In the end, of course, no fact can kill a theory \u2014not even as impressive an assemblage as the one that Stierand Tienda have gathered. The poli-tics of poverty are such that ideologi-cal commitments make it hard tochange minds: I doubt that a readingof this book will lead advocates of theculture of poverty \u2014or is it the culture of blame? \u2014to look at the matter in a different light. But if resistant to per-suasion, they should still be able toappreciate this book 's many virtues. Linking past and present, as Stier andTienda have done, is no small feat:surely, even unfriendly critics canagree that poverty is at least partly the result of cumulative causation, whichis why unraveling the circle, as theseauthors have done, is the only way toachieve intellectual results. To be sure,one can anticipate the riposte: isn 't cumulative causation just anotherword for \"culture of poverty, \" with Stier and Tienda telling us that thepoor lock themselves into their ownfate? But Stier and Tienda 's argument involves a contention about pathwaysand their consequences: though influ-enced by poverty, it is the pathwaychosen that exercises the long-termeffect. By contrast, a cultural argumentinvolves something else: a demonstra-tion that the poor view the worldthrough a distinctive lens, and there-fore, act differently from others. Andany effort to ascribe behavior to theculture of the poor would also have toinquire into the culture of the non-poor\u2014whose views of, and behavior toward, the impoverished are as cul-tural as anything else, and surely arenot without effect. Some readers may find the style of analysis off-putting, notwithstandingthe authors ' efforts to write a user- friendly book. The quantitative arts, asapplied social science style, will simplynot appeal to all tastes. One can alreadyhear those of different methodologicalpersuasions complaining that the booktakes a mechanistic approach, treatingthe \"subjects \" it analyzes as if they were balls in a billiards game, as opposed toreal-live, thinking, feeling people mak-ing decisions on their own. Perhapsthey're not entirely wrong. But it 's never fair to fault the authors for thebook they didn'twrite. Like any other, this book needs to be evaluated on itsown terms \u2014in which case, there can 't be any question about the nature of theaccomplishment. While waiting for controversy to erupt, however, the friendly critic canissue a few quibbles of his own. In gen-eral, Stier and Tienda persuade thatintergroup differences, in and of them-selves, are of little, if any, import. Butthe terminology is occasionally confus-ing. It 's a bit disconcerting, in a book entitled The Color of Opportunity , to learn that \"racial differences \" are only those concerning blacks and whites; it 's also bothersome to do cross-checkingwhen it turns out that the usage is notquite consistent. There is also the mat- ter of how to interpret the relativeimportance of intergroup differences.One can 't quarrel with Stier and Tienda if one keeps the focus on blacks andwhites. But if one asks about the num-ber of domains in which one observesat least one important intergroup dif-ference \u2014controlling for earlier experi- ences \u2014then the weight of earlier expe- riences, as such, doesn 't seem to be quite so great. This reader is also not fully com- fortable with the way in which Stierand Tienda handled the one clear lineof distinction between blacks andwhites \u2014namely, the greater likeli- hood that African American teens willbear a child outside of marriage, ascompared with whites. Yes, having achild out of wedlock has a negativeeffect on a range of outcomes acrossall groups. But is its impact on AfricanAmericans simply due to its greaterprevalence \u2014or does the response to out-of-wedlock births take a differentform among members of this group aswell? And one can 't help but note the tone of special pleading that creepsinto the discussion, when Stier andTienda try to explain the strongerracial effects in Chicago as opposed tothe national sample. But these are surely minor com- plaints, not worthy of distractingattention from this book 's many strengths. The Color of Opportunity is a skillful demonstration of the best thatsocial science can do, using the latesttools, and applying them to the typeof hard-won evidence best suited forthe question at hand. Of course,knowledge is no more than that, leav-ing the problem just as it was whenthe authors wrote. But one can 't get anywhere, if one doesn 't know where one's going. For their contribution to understanding America 's thus far intractable poverty dilemma, theauthors of this outstanding book haveboth students of poverty, and advo-cates of change, in their debt.
