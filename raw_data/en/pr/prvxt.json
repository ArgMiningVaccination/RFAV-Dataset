Thus ends the chapter called Dinacarya, the second in sutrasthana of Astanga hrudaya - Ayurvedic Seasonal Regimen Ritucharya is the 3rd chapter of Ashtanga Hrudayam. The word Ritucharya is made of two words - Ritu means seasons Charya means do's and don'ts ( regimen ). This important chapter discusses in detail regarding different seasons and the regimen to be followed. Six Seasons - in the Ancient Ayurvedic (two Masa). Shishira Ritu (winter, dewy season) - Magha and Phalguna (Mid January - Mid March) Vasanta Ritu (Spring season) - Chaitra and Vaishakha (Mid March - Mid May) Greeshma Ritu (Summer season) - Jyeshta and Ashadha (Mid May to Mid July) The above three Ritus form Uttarayana - Northern solstice. Here, fire is dominant. It is also called as Adana Kala, wherein the human strength is relatively low. Varsha Ritu (Rainy Season) - Shravana and Bhadrapada - Mid July - mid September Sharath Ritu (Autumn season) - Ashvayuja and Karthika - Mid September to Mid November Hemantha Ritu (Winter season) - Margashira and Pushya - Mid November to Mid January These three seasons form Dakshinayana - Southern solstice. It is also called as Visarga Kala, wherein the human strength will be relatively high. Uttarayana - Adana kala - Northern Solstice - mid the nature of the path, both the Sun and wind become very strong, powerful and dry during this half of the year. It takes away all the cooling qualities of the earth. Bitter, Astringent and Pungent tastes (Tikta, kashaya and Katu Rasas) will be more powerful, respectively, in the successive Ritus. Hence Adana Kala is dominated by Visarga Kala - Southern period, the Sun releases strength of the people. Here moon is more powerful, earth is cooled down due to clouds, rain and cold wind. Sour, Salt and sweet (Amla, Lavana and Madhura) tastes are dominant respectively during the three seasons of this period. Variation in strength as per season - \u0000 | Winter - Hemantha and Shishira - mid November - mid March - Highest strength Summer and rainy seasons - mid May - mid September - Lowest strength Spring and Autumn - Medium strength. 1. Hemanta Ritucharya - Ayurveda Winter regimen: Mid are strong, digestive fire becomes powerful, because it gets obstructed from flowing outward due to external winter.

Hence, in this period, one should consume food predominant with sweet sour and salt nights are longer, person feels hungry early in the morning. So, after attending to oblutions, one should resort to Abhaynga (oil massage) with oils that have Vata balancing properties. Massage should be done especially to scalp and forehead.

Then fine powder of Saffron and kasthuri (musk) is applied. The body is exposed to the fumes of aguru (Aquilaria agallocha) Since the digestion power is high, heavy-to-digest food such as meat soup mixed with fats, meat of well nourished animals, wine prepared with jaggery, supernatant part of wine (Sura) should be had more.

It includes - right quantity of food to take, right time to take food, types of indigestion and their treatment, qualities and types of after drinks, right method of food intake etc. Right Amount of Food always consume proper quantity of food. Right amount of food activates Agni - digestion power (which is compared to fire, in Ayurveda). Food that are light to digest (laghu) and those that are hard to digest (Guru) both require a specified quantity for proper digestion. As a general rule, if the food is heavy to digest (such as oily food, non veg, sweets etc), it should be consumed till half of the satiation level is achieved. (Ardha Sauhitya). If the food is light to digest, it should be consumed till one is not overly satiated. (Na Ati Truptata). The right amount of food is that, which undergoes digestion easily. Effect of taking more or less amount of quantity of food - \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 Consuming less quantity of food does not increase strength, ojus (immunity). The body will not be nourished properly. Over a period of time, it leads to Vata imbalance disorders. Excess quantity of food is again not desirable. It causes quick increase of Doshas. 3 - 3\u00bd. Due to eating excess quantity of food, Vata and other Doshas suddenly get increased together and associating with the undigested and vitiated food (Ama) , produce diseases. It causes Alasaka disease by blocking the movement of food inside the alimentary tract and Visuchika (gastro enteritis) by expelling out the undigested food in both downward and upward directions (diarrhoea and vomiting) simultaneously. This is seen in persons who are not self controlled and who can not control their craze for eating. 4-5. Alasaka - indigestion + constipation: \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 Food neither comes out in the upper route by vomiting nor from the downward route by purgation. Nor does it undergo digestion in the stomach. It stays in the stomach lazily (=Alasya). Such a disease condition is called as profound aggravation Vata, along with other Doshas, the person experiences pain in entire body, as though being pricked by needles, hence this disease is called Visuchika. (Suchi means needle). Influence of different causes Shoola Bhrama Delusion Anaha - bloating, fullness Kampa - tremors Stambha - stiffness etc symptoms.

In them, Vata gets increased, gets associated with Kapha to obstruct the movement of undigested food in the digestive tract. It causes the food to stay inside the stomach, as a foreign body. It leads to abdominal colic and such other symptoms, but without vomiting and diarrhea. 10 - 11. obstructed channels by accumulation of undigested food. Thus Doshas get obstructed in the GI tract, and begin to move in other unnatural channels. Thus Doshas spread throughout the body and make it stiff like a log of wood. This disease is called Dandakalasaka, which should be rejected for treatment as it is quick in causing death. 12.

Treatment principle for diseases Even the other diseases should be treated by adopting treatments which are opposite of their causative factors. It is called as Hetu Viparyaya Chikitsa. Hetu means causative factors. If, however, the diseases reoccur or persist for long time then the Hetu Viparyaya should be given up and disease specific treatment should be adopted. It is called which, though not actually opposite of either the cause or the diseases still produce the desired result) should be adopted; When the Doshas have returned to normal, when the Ama is completely relieved, when digestion activity is completely restored to normalcy, then oil-bath, drinking of oil (oleation therapies) and enema therapy, etc. should be administered appropriately.

Food should be consumed observing the rules and procedures of taking food. That is the ideal time. 54 - 55. Thus ends the chapter called Matrashitiya, the eighth in the Sutrasthana of called as Dravyadi Vijnaneeya Adhayaya. It explains about substances and its qualities, how a medicinal substance brings about action etc. Importance of the substance - Dravya Pradhanya \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 , \u0000\u0000 Dravya - (substance / mass of the substance) is the most important factor among Rasa (tastes) and other qualities; because all of these qualities are residing in the substance only. \u0000\u0000 Dravya/Mass is composed of five basic elements. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 It has Kshma - solidity as its substratum, it takes origin from Ambu (Ap Bhuta - water element), Agni (Tejas Bhuta - Fire element), Pavana (Vayu Bhuta - air element) and Nabhas (Akasha Bhuta - ether element), with their intimate and inseparable combination. Its identification/designation is decided by the predominance of particular element in the Dravya (mass / substance). 1-2. Notes :- Panchabhuta refers to five basic elements - Earth (solid), Water, Fire, Air and Ether. As per a philosophy, called as Sankhya philosophy, every substance on earth is composed of these five basic elements, in different proportions. The dominant part of the basic element decides the nature of the substance. Five Basic elements - Prithvi - Earth - Gandha (smell) is the special quality, Guru (heaviness), Khara (roughness), Kathina (hard) etc are its general qualities. Ap - Water - Rasa (taste) is its special quality, Tejas - Fire - Rupa (appearance) is its special quality Vayu - Air - Sparsha (touch) is its special quality Akasha - Ether - Shabda (sound) is its special Hridaya Sutrasthan Page No. 128 Astanga Hridaya Sutrasthan These elements combine together in an inseparable combination (Samavaya) to become gross objects and give rise to the formation of all the substances of this universe. Hence the entire universe is Panchabhautik (composed of five elements, hence designated as Prapancha). The proportion/quantity of each Bhuta (element) varies and hence the existence of variety of substances in this universe, each one very different and unique. Whichever element is predominant in any substance bestows its name to that substance. If Prithvi Bhuta (earth element) is more than the other four in a certain combination, then the substance the gets formed is called Parthiva - solid; If Ap Bhuta (water element) is dominant - then Apya - liquid If Tejas Bhuta (fire element) is more, it will be Taijasa (Agneya), if Vayu Bhuta (air element) it will be Vayavya, and if Akasabhuta (space element) is more, it will be Akasheeya (Nabhasa). Thus all the substances of the universe are classified into five kinds. Rasa - Anurasa - (Primary and \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 3 substance also arises out of Pancha mahabhuta (5 element) combination. Hence, because of the combination of the elements, there is no substance having only one taste. Similarly, there is no disease arising out of a single Dosha. Any disease will have involvement of more than one Dosha. Taste (rasa) is of two types. Primary taste (Rasa ) - the taste that is perceived clearly. The one that manifests clearly in a substance. \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 Secondary taste (Anurasa ) - which are not clearly manifest or which are recognized at the end. 3. \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 Guru (heaviness) etc qualities present in the Prithvi (earth) etc substances of are residing in the taste of the substance); Qualities of a substance are ascribed to the taste because of their intimate co-existence. Astanga Hridaya Sutrasthan Page No. 129 Astanga Hridaya Sutrasthan Qualities of substances based on the predominance of elements - Qualities of solid heavy to digest), Sthula (bulky), Sthira (stable) and Gandha (smell) qualities. Hence, substances that have Earth as the predominant element (Parthiva Dravya) have Gaurava (heaviness), Sthairya (stability), Samghata (compactness) and well nourished qualities - 5 Qualities of Guru (Heavy to digest), Snigdha (unctuous, oily, moisture), Manda (dull), Sandra (thickness, dense) and rasa (taste) qualities. Substances containing liquid as predominant element (Apya qualities. 6. Agneya Dravya Laksana sharp), Ushna (hot), Vishada (non-slimy), Sookshma (minute) and Rupa (appearance, showing, from) Substances that have fire as the main element causes Daha (burning sensation), Bha (luster), Varna (expression of colour) and Pachana ( digestion, process of transformation, putrefaction etc.) 7. Qualities produces dryness, Laghava (lightness), Vaishadya (transparency, clarity), Vichara (movements, different kinds of activities) and exhaustion 8. Qualities of ether dominant with ether dominance produce cavitation (hollowness) and \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 There is nothing in this universe, which cannot be used as medicine.Knowledge and purpose of each substance is required to use any substance as medicine. 10. Properties of Dravyas \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 Fire (Agni) and Pavana (air) predominant substances generally have the property of moving upwards \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 Bhumi (earth) and Toya (water) dominant substances generally have the property of moving downwards - 11 Virya is that property, through which drug action is made possible. No drug action is possible without Veerya and all actions are possible only by the Virya 13. Some authors opine that there are 8 types of Veerya (potency of an herb/medicinal (unctuous, oily) and Rooksha (dryness) Hima (cold) and Ushna Guru (Heaviness) etc. eight qualities as Veerya, do so by direct implication. Out of 20 qualities, these 8 qualities are predominantly seen in any substance, these 8 qualities are stronger than the rest qualities, are important in day - to - day routine, applicable to majority of substances being considered first in scientific procedures. Hence, these 8 have been given importance. 14-15. Why Rasa and Others are these are opposite to the 4 reasons mentioned above, hence gurvadi 8 qualities Ushna (hot) and Sheeta (cold) - only these 2 qualities as Veerya (potency). Because, though substances are of many kinds and qualities, only fire and water (Agni and Soma) are the powerful ones. 17-18. Astanga Hridaya Sutrasthan excessive thirst Glani - exhaustion, Sveda - perspiration, Daha - burning sensation, Ashupakita - quick cooking (transformation) and mitigation of Vata and Kapha; Action activities of life, enlivening Sthambha - stoppage, withholding, restraining and Rakta Pitta Prasada - purification of blood and calming change in the tastes that a substance undergoes at the end of digestion by the association of Jatharagni (fire in the stomach - digestion power, digestive juice in stomach), is called as Vipaka (taste conversion after digestion). 20. \u0000 \u0000 types of Vipaka (taste conversion after digestion). Swadu (sweet) and Patu (salt) tastes undergo Madhura Vipaka (sweet). Sour remains as sour itself - Amla - Amla Vipaka (taste conversion after digestion) Tikta (bitter), Ushna (pungent) and Kasaya (astringent) tastes Katu Sutrasthan Page No. 133 Astanga Hridaya Sutrasthan So, generally, sweet and Salt tastes get converted into sweet taste Sour remains as sour and Bitter, pungent and astringent convert into pungent. \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 The effects of the tastes, which are felt in the mouth and of the Vipaka (taste conversion after digestion) are similar. That means the effect of sweet taste and sweet Vipaka are similar. 21\u00bd. Mechanism of action of substances act by the action of taste or by Vipaka (taste conversion after digestion) or by the qualities that they posses (Guna (qualities)) or by Veerya (potency) them (Rasa, Guna, Vipaka, Virya and Prabhava) it suppresses all the other qualities to exhibit special influence and action. \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 In case of combination of two opposite qualities, the strong one vanquishes the weak. 23\u00bd - 24. \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 When two opposing qualities are present in equal strength, in that situation, Vipaka (taste conversion after digestion) wins over Rasa (taste); Veerya (potency) wins over (Rasa (taste) and Vipaka and Prabhava (special effect) wins over all of them (Rasa, Vipaka and Veerya) This is the pattern of natural 25. Prabhava - special effect:- \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 over-ruling Rasa (taste), Guna (qualities), Vipaka (taste Vipaka, and Veerya in a drug may be similar, sometimes the herb may exhibit entirely different action opposite to these qualities. That special effect of the drug over- ruling inherent qualities is called as with (plumbago zeylanica) respect Rasa (taste) etc, Danti is a purgative while Chitraka is not. Hence, purgation is the Prabhava of Danti. Similarly so, are Licorice - Glycyrrhiza glabra) and Mrdvika (grapes) Madhuka and dry grapes - both have similar qualities. But dry grape has mild purgative action, but Madhuka does not. Milk and ghee - both possess similar qualities. But ghee increases digestion strength but milk does not. Hence increasing digestion strength is the special effect of ghee. 26. Vichitra as Vichitra Pratyarabda exists. It means - born out of peculiar combination of peculiar factors. For example: both wheat and barley possess sweat and heaviness qualities yet wheat mitigates Vata but barley aggravates it. Fish and milk are sweet and heavy but still milk is cool and fish is hot. Meat of lion and meat of pig both are sweet in taste but still lion meat has Katu Vipaka (pungent taste conversion after digestion) and pig meat has sweet Vipaka (taste conversion after digestion). Thus ends 10 Rasabhediyam \u0000 Tastes, Their Qualities and Effects The 10 th chapter of Ashtanga Hrudaya Sutrasthana is called as Rasabhediya adhyaya. Rasa means taste and bheda means types. This chapter discusses in detail regarding the types of tastes and their properties. Tastes - Types and introduction Origin of taste - formed due to the combination of two Bhutas (primary elements). Madhura (sweet) - Prithvi + Ap (earth + water) Amla (sour) - Tejas + Ap (fire + water) Lavana (salt) - Ap + Tejas (water + fire) Tikta (bitter) - Akasa + Vayu (ether + air) Katu (pungent) - Tejas + Vayu (Fire and air) Kashaya (astringent) - Prithvi + Vayu (earth + air) - 1. Characteristics of tastes - Rasa Lakshana is understood by its sticking in the oral cavity, providing a feeling of contentment and pleasure to the body and comfort to the sense organs. It is liked even by ants 2. Amla (sour) \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 mouth watery, causes horripilation, tingling of the teeth and leads to closing of the eyes and brows. 3. Astanga Hridaya Sutrasthan \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Lavana (salt) causes more moisture in the mouth (increase salivation) and burning sensation in the cheeks and throat. 3\u00bd. Tikta (bitter) \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 Tikta (bitter) cleanses the mouth and destroys the organs of taste (makes perception of other tastes impossible). 4. Katu (pungent) \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 Katu (pungent) stimulates tip of the tongue, causes irritation, brings out secretions from the eyes, nose and mouth and causes burning sensation of the cheeks. 5 Kashaya (astringent) \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 Kashaya (astringent) inactivates the tongue (diminishes capacity of taste perception) and causes obstructions of the passage in the throat. 5\u00bd. Action of tastes - Rasa Karma being accustomed since birth, produces greater strength in the body tissues. It is very good for children, the aged, the wounded, the emaciated, improves skin complexion, hairs, strength of sense organs and Ojas (essence of the tissues, immunity). Sweet taste causes stoutness of the body, good for the throat, increases breast milk, unites fractured bones. Astanga Hridaya Sutrasthan Page No. 137 Astanga Hridaya Sutrasthan Sweet is not easily digestible, activities; It is unctuous, mitigates Pitta, Vata and Visha (poison). By excess use it produces diseases arising from fat and Kapha, obesity, Asthma, unconsciousness, diabetes, enlargements of glands of the neck, malignant tumour (cancer) and such others. 7-9 Sour and is unctuous, good for the heart, digestive, appetizer, hot in potency, cold on touch (coolant on external applications, relieves burning sensation), Sour taste satiates, causes moistening, it is easy for digestion, causes aggravation of Kapha, Pitta and Asra (blood) and used in excess, causes looseness of the body, loss of strength, blindness, giddiness, itching (irritation), pallor (whitish yellow discoloration as in anaemia), Visarpa - Herpes, spreading skin disease, swellings, Visphota (small pox), thirst and fevers. 10 - rigidity, clears the obstructions of the channels and pores, increases digestive activity, lubricates, causes sweating, penetrates deep into the tissues, improves taste, new growth, abscess etc.).

Used in excess, it causes depletion of Dhatus (tissues) and diseases of Vata origin. 14 - 16. Actions of pungent taste throat, allergic rashes, leprosy and other skin diseases, Alasaka (a kind of indigestion), swelling (odema); reduces the swelling of the ulcers, dries up the unctuousness (greasiness), fat, and moisture (water); Pungent taste increases hunger, it is digestive, improves taste, Shodhana (cleansing, eliminates the Dosas), dries up moisture of the food, breaks up hard masses, dilates (expands) the channels and balances Kapha. By over use, it causes thirst, depletion of Sukra (reproductive element, sperm) and strength, fainting (loss of consciousness) contractures, tremors and pain in the waist, back etc. 17 - 19. Actions of astringent taste not easily digestible; cleanses the blood, causes squeezing and healing of ulcers (wounds), has cold potency, dries up the moisture and fat, hinders the digestion of undigested food. Astringent taste is water absorbent, thereby causing constipation, drynessand cleanses the skin too causes stasis of food without digestion, flatulence, pain in the heart region, thirst, emaciation, loss of virility, obstruction of the channels and constipation. 20 - 21\u00bd. Madhura two Medas - sugarcane, Gokshura, Ksaudra, Draksa etc. form the group of sweet substances. 22 - 24. Amla Gana - acidissima, Karamardaka form the sour group. 25 - salt, Romaka, Pamshuja, Seesa form Ativisha, Vacha etc. group of bitters. Pippali, Chitraka and ginger, leafy vegetables such as Kutheraka and others (mentioned in verse 103 of chapter 6 earlier), Pitta (bile of animals), Mutra (urines), Arushkara taste increase Kapha except old Shali (more than one year old rice) and Yava - Barley - Hordeum vulgare, Mudga (green gram), Godhuma (wheat), Kshaudra (honey), Sita (sugar) and meat of animals of desert - like lands. Amla \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 Generally substances of sour except Dadima - Pomegranate - salts are bad for the eyes (vision) except Saindhava - except for Amrita (Indian tinospora), Patoli, Shunthi (ginger), Krishna obstructive - except Abhaya - Chebulic Myrobalan potency (Ushna Veerya (potency), each one, more so \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 Similarly Tikta Madhura (sweet) are cold in potency, each one more in their succeeding order. Ruksha are dry and cause constipation (each one more so in their succeeding order) Snigdha \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 while Patu (salt), Amla unctuous and help elimination of faeces, urine and flatus, each one more so in their succeeding order.

These are to be selected and used after considering the conditions of the Dosas and drugs (and therapies). 44. Thus ends the chapter entitled Rasabhediya, the tenth in Sutrasthana of - \u0000 \u0000\u0000 - doshas 11 th chapter of Sutrasthana of Ashtanga Hrudayam explains in detail regarding Tridosha in Tridosha are - Vata, Pitta and Kapha. Understanding Tridosha concept is your first step towards learning Ayurveda. The chapter is called as Doshadi Vijnaneeya Adhyaya. Chief constituents of the body | Dosha - Dhatu - Body tissues - Rasa (lymph / product of digestion), Rakta (blood), Mamsa (muscle), Meda (fat), Asthi (bone), Majja and Shukra (male and female reproductory secretions) Mala - waste products - sweat, urine and faeces Doshas, are the roots of the body. 1. Functions of normal Doshas - Prakruta Dosa responsible for all movements. (Movement of blood in blood vessels, movement of nutrients, movement of air in lungs, locomotion movements of hands and legs etc. ) In its normal state Vata causes enthusiasm, Vatha Dosha regulates respiration process, Regulates all locomotor movements, Regulates all activities of mind, speech, initiation of natural urges (tears, faeces, urination, sneezing, coughing, vomiting yawning etc) maintenance of the Dhatus (tissues) in their normalcy and proper functioning of the sense organs.

They are inverse proportionately related with each other. 26 - 27. Cause for increase or decrease Mala is usually due to excess nutrition (Tarpana), which is followed later on with increase of Kapha. Whereas the decrease of Doshas, Dhatus and Malas is due to loss of nutrition which is followed, later with increase of Vayu (Vata).

It attends to the functions such as ejaculation, menstruation, defecation, urination and child birth. 9 Five types of Pitta- \u0000\u0000 large intestine and stomach. (between Amashaya and pakvashaya) It is composed of all the five basic elements (Panchamaha Bhuta), it is predominant with fire element and devoid of water element. It is called by the term Anala- fire because of its function of Paka - digestion and transformation of food materials. It cooks the food, divides it into essence and waste, It bestows grace and influence on other types of Pitta. Hence, among all the types of Pitta, Pachaka pitta \u0000 The the Amasaya- stomach is known as Ranjaka. It converts the useful part of the digestion into blood. Hence it converts Rasa Dhatu Hrudaya -heart is known as Sadhaka.

Qualities that influence increase and decrease of Tridosha - Note: In the description given below, Chaya means - first level increase of Dosha in their own place. Kopa / Prakopa - means increase and overflow of Doshas from its own place to other place. It has the potential to cause the disease. Shama / Prashama - means decrease of increased Dosha and restoration of health. Qualities that cause Chaya, movement, etc causes Vata Chaya. Coldness along with dryness causes Kopa. Snigdha pichila (stickiness), sthira (stability) etc. associated with hotness bring about its Shamana of Vata. 19 Qualities that strong) and other qualities- dryness, lightness, etc associated with cold cause Chaya- mild increase of Pitta, The above qualities associated with hot, cause Kopa - profound increase of Pitta. Manda (viscous, mild) and other qualities like stickyness, stability etc, associated with cold bring about Pitta Shama- reduction back to normal. 20 Qualities that cause mild, etc along with cold quality causes Kapha chaya. (mild increase) Same Snigdha - unctuous, oily etc qualities associated with Usna - hot cause Kapha Kopa Manda- dull and others- rough, dry, clarity, movement, lightness associated with cold quality bring about Kapha Shama- reduction to normal. 21 Overall , Vata Dosha - Ushna (hot) + Ruksha (dryness) qualities cause Vata Chaya Sheeta (cold) + Ruksha (dryness) and Vata Kopa Ushna (hot) + Snigdha shama. Pitta Dosha Sheeta (cold) cause Pitta Chaya Ushna (hot) + Teekshna (piercing, strong) etc qualities cause Pitta Kopa Sheeta of Dosha in its own place. It produces dislike against the things that would cause further increase of particular Dosha. It is a self defense mechanism of the body to avoid further increase of Dosha, which may lead to disease. 22 Astanga of Dosha and overflow of increased Dosha into other body channels. It causes appearance of symptoms of increased Dosha, leading to onset of disease process. The premonitory symptoms of the disease can be observed at this stage. Sama \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 Sama means normalcy. Restoration / decrease of increased Dosha to its normal levels. Fluctuation of Dosha in increase) during summer by the use of Plants possessing such as lightness, dryness etc. It is especially so, in the bodies of persons possessing such qualities. But during summer, Vata does not undergo profound increase due to the heat of the summer. (Remember, cold is a quality of vata). Hot is opposite to Vata, hence there is no increase by a large extent. Similarly, Pitta undergoes chaya in rainy season, because of production of Amla viplaka (sour taste at the end of digestion) of water and foods. But it does not undergo further increase in rainy season, because of coldness. (Remember, hot is the quality of Pitta) Coldness checks further increase of Pitta in rainy season. Hridaya Hridaya Sutrasthan Kapha undergoes Chaya in winter by the use of foods with cold and oily qualiies. But it does not undergo prakopa because Kapha becomes solidified due to severe cold food habits can cause increase or decrease of Dosha. At the same time, seasonal effect also may cause Dosha increase or decrease. 28 Action of increased Dhosha - \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 When there is a flood, the water gushes into the cities very fast, but the reversal process is very slow. Similarly, the increased Doshas spread throughout body from foot to head to produce diseases but the decrease of Dosha and restoration of normalcy takes a very long time. 29 Dosha is the main cause for bird flying high in the sky cannot escape from its shadow, the root cause for disease lies in Tridosha. Even the mental qualities such as Satva, Raja and Tama are influenced by Tridosha. Dosha get vitiated, then cause vitiation of body tissues (Dhatu) and waste products (Mala) to cause disease. 32-34 \u00bc Three kinds of increase can be categorized as - Less involvement (heena yoga), - Wrong involvement (Mithya yoga) - Over involvement Astanga sense organs Kala - season Karma - action . So, less, wrongful or more involvement of sense organs / seasons / action leads to Dosha imbalance. It is explained further. Artha - of sense organs - insufficient, inadequate, contact or non- contact with the objects of senses- sound, touch, sight, taste and smell with their respective sense organs. For example, not at all hearing to sounds, or living in a low lit area etc Atiyoga is over indulgence. Seeing objects which are very minute, bright etc, gazing for a very long time, hearing to loud music etc. Mithya Yoga - wrong indulgence with sense organs - seeing / hearing frightening, very close, very far, disliked and abnormal objects cold, hot and rainy. Hinayoga of the Kala is - less cold in winter, less temperature in summer and less rain in rainy season. Atiyoga is - more rain in rainy season, more temperature in summer etc. Mithyayoga is manifestation of qualities opposites of the natural ones of the season. Example - rain during summer, cold weather during summer etc. 38 \u00bd 39 Astanga of actions pertaining to mind, body and speech lead to Dosha imbalance. Heenayoga - very less speaking, very little physical activity, very less thought process. Atiyoga - excessive speaking, excess physical activity and excessive thinking. Mithyayoga - wrong speaking, wrong physical activities and wrong, evil thinking, suppression of natural urges, improper postures, abrupt jumping and falling, speaking - too much immediately after meals , harboring of desires- attachment, passion, causes for increase of Doshas, thus increased they produce many kinds of diseases, involving the mind, tissues, viscera, bones and joints. 43-44 Pathways of diseases - Rogamargas :- The body is divided into three sections to explain different diseases. Antarogamarga - internal path - refers to gastro intestinal tract. Bahi roga marga - external path - refers to Rakta, Mamsa etc Dhatu (tissues) and skin. Madhyama rogamarga - it includes vital organs such as brain, heart, blood vessels, joints, nerves etc. This concept is explained below in detail. Bahi Koshta / Bahi Raktha- blood and others tissues (Blood, muscles, bone, fat, bone marrow and sex related secretions) and skin continue the Bahya Rogamarga - external pathway of disease. It is related with diseases such as moles, discolored patches on face, Gandalaji- goiter, glandular ulcer on the face, malignant tumors, hemorrhoids, abdominal tumor, swelling and other external diseases. 44 \u00bd -45 Anta Koshta / small intestine, Pakwashaya - large intestine The above two, along with the entire gastro intestinal tract is called as Mahasrota. (The big channel). This constitutes the Anta Koshta. Diseases which affect this path are - vomiting, diarrhea, cough, dyspnoea, enlargement of the abdomen, fever, dropsy, hemorrhoids, abdominal abscess etc. 46 urinary bladder and such other vital organs, joints of bones, blood vessels, tendons, ligaments, nerves constitute the madhyama rogamarga. From it arise, consumption , hemiplegia, facial paralysis, diseases of the head and other organs, pain, stiffness- loss of movement of the joints, bones, waist etc. 47-48 Different symptoms produced by increased Dosha - cutting pain Swapa - loss of sensation Sada - weakness, loss of function Ruk - pain Toda - continuous pain Bhedanam - splitting pain Sanga - Constriction, Angabhanga - bodyache, Sankocha - shrinking of the organ, reduction in size Varta - twisting, Harshana - tingling sensation Tarshana - thirst Kampa - tremors Parushya - roughness Saushirya - feeling of empty Shosha - dryness Spandana - pulsating Veshtana - rigidity, as if tied Sthambha - stiffness Kashaya rasata - astringent taste in mouth Aruna, Shyava Varna - appearance of blue or crimson discoloration - these are the abnormal signs and symptoms of increased Vayu -Vata. 49-50 reddish discoloration Ushmapakita - heat, increase in temperature, formation of pus, ulcers Sveda - sweating Kleda - inflammation with wetness, moistness Sruti - inflammation with pus / oozing Kotha - putrefaction- decomposition - toxicity Katuka Amla Rasa - bitter and sour taste in the mouth Pandu Aruna Varjitaha - appearance of color other than and crimson. 51- 52 Gaurava - heavyness Bandha - obstruction, Upalepa - coating, as if tied with a wet cloth Staimitya - stiffness, loss of movement Shopha - inflammation Apakti - indigestion, Atinidrata - varna - white discolouration Svadu lavana rasa - sweet, salt taste in mouth Chirakarita - delay in all the features, which appear in diseases, are to be recognized by the physician through inspection and others - methods of examination of patient. 54 Importance of patient observation: To gain the knowledge of the different stages of disease the physician should observe the patient every minute.55 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 Knowledge of successful treatment is obtained from constant practice just as knowledge of determining the quality of gems is obtained only from- knowing the science. 56 Three kinds of diseases based on cause of three kinds viz, Karmaja Vyadhi - Includes Diseases that originate due to bad deeds of the past lives, or of present life or of both past and present lives. Usually the cause for such disease is not clearly known. 57 from the specific causes, which lead to Dosha increase and then to disease manifestation. Doshakarmaja - combination of bad deeds and indulgence in causes of disease result in disease. Usually the symptoms are profound in this case. 58 Treatment for such diseases: \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 The Doshaja diseases get cured from indulgence in food, activities and medicine that have opposite qualities to the cause. Karmaja diseases get cured after the termination of the effects of such acts of previous / current lives. Dosha-Karmaja diseases get cured after the mitigation of Dosha and nullifying of effects of past deeds. 59 Two kinds of diseases - based on cause - have their own specific causes, comforting methods and clearly manifest features.

If they do not get subsided then, treatment has to be given- for the secondary diseases as well. If powerful, secondary affections should be treated soon because these- complication cause more troublers to the body which is already debilitated by should never feel shy for not knowing the nomenclature of the disease, for there is no rule/ custom/ state, that every disease has depending upon the nature of the causative factors, travels to many parts of the body and produces many disease, hence treatment of the disease, its abode- site should be judged very quickly with the help of knowledge of the disease. 65-66 Factors to observe in should minutely examine and determine, Dushya - the Dhatus and Malas involved in a diseases Desha - the area of the body where disease is manifested, the living place of the patient Bala - strength of the patient Kala- season, how old is the disease, age of the person etc. Anala- digestive power of the patient Prakriti- Body constitution, Vayas- age of the patient and disease, Satva- mind, tolerance capacity of the patient Satmya- The food and activities to which the patient is accustomed to. Ahara- food habits and Avastha- stages of the diseases The physician should watch for above factors to decide and then only, the physician should decide on the aggravated Dosha and its appropriate treatment.

The strength of the disease varies based on strength and weakness of the mind and body of the patient. Hence the physician should be very attentive. 69. who determines a grievous disease as a mild one, goes wrong in treatment because of under estimating the condition the drugs/ therapies in small doses. Such mild treatment causes worsening of the disease because of ineffective treatment. On the other hand, if the person over estimates the strength of the disease and over treats with Panchakarma and oral medicines, it will also trouble the health of the patient to a very great extent. 71- 72 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 Hence the physician should constantly study the science, determine the exact condition of all factors, all the time and then administer appropriate medicines and treatments. 73 Astanga Hridaya Sutrasthan Page No. 176 Dosha increase and decrease are 62.

Thus ends the chapter Gandushadi Vidhi - the Vidhi \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 - Eye drops, Eye salve Therapy Let us explore Ayurveda eye treatment methods and types. This is the 23 rd chapter of Ashtanga Hrudaya Sutrasthana, written by Acharya Vagbhata, son of is called as Aschotana Anjana Vidhi Adhyaya. Aschotana and Anjana refer to eye therapies. Aschotana = application of liquid drug in the form of drops in the eyes. Aschotana - Herbal eye drops In all diseases of the eyes, Aschotana (eye drops) is very beneficial. It helps to prevent Ruk - eye pain Toda - pricking pain Kandu - eye itching Gharsha - feeling of friction in the eyes Ashru - excessive lacrimation, tears Daha - burning sensation Raga - eye redness. 1. Drops of medicated liquids should be warm in case of Vata imbalance. Lukewarm in Kapha imbalance and cold in Rakta (blood) and Pitta imbalance. Aschotana Vidhi - procedure :- The person should lie on a cot in a place devoid of breeze. His eyes should be opened with the left hand of the physician The medicine dispenser, either a seashell or a wick is held in the right hand of the physician just two Angulas (finger width) above the inner angle of the eye (inner canthus) 10 - 12 drops of the medicated liquid are put into the eye.

In disorders due to blood and Pitta vitiation, eyes are mopped with a cloth dipped in cold water. 2 - 4 Very hot and strong medicinal drops lead to pain, redness and loss of vision; Very cold drops produce pricking pain, loss of movement of eye balls and discomfort; Excess therapy produces roughness of the lids, friction and difficulty in opening of the lids; Inadequate (less) therapy leads to worsening of the diseases, increase of swelling, redness and absence of lacrimation. 5 - 6. The medicine dropped into the eye, entering into the channels of the joints (fornices of the eyes), head, nose and face, eliminates the imbalanced Doshas which have localized in the upper parts of the body. 7. Astanga Hridaya Sutrasthan Page No. 278 Astanga Hridaya Sutrasthan Anjana Vidhi - procedure of applying collyrium is suitable for the person who has his body purified by Vamana, Virechana etc, in whom the Doshas are localized in the eyes only, when signs of fully ripened state such as slight oedema (Alpa shopha), severe itching (Ati kandu) and sliminess (Paichilya) are found, when the excretions of the eyes are thick, in persons who are being troubled by Pitta, Kapha and blood and especially in Vata imbalance. 8 - 9. Anjana is of three kinds - \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 Lekhana - scarifying, scraping Ropana - healing and Drishti prasadana - making the vision clear, soothing to the eyes; Lekhana Anjana \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 is prepared from herbs of astringent, sour, salt, and pungent tastes and hot potency; Ropana Anjana \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 is prepared from herbs of bitter taste and Prasadana Anjana \u0000 \u0000 from herbs of sweet taste and effects of strong collyrium, Prasadana Anjana is used. This kind of usage of one Anjana against the effects of the other is called as Pratyanjana - counter collyrium. Anjana Shalaka - Collyrium apparatus \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 , A metal rod, 10 Angula in length, thin in the middle, with tips resembling a flower bud is best suited for Anjana application. \u0000 For Lekhana Anjana, the Shalaka should be made of copper \u0000 \u0000 For Ropana, it should be made of iron or finger itself can be used. \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 For Prasadana, Shalaka of gold and silver is used. 12 - 13.

Anjana Kala should NOT be made at nights, during sleep, at midday, when the eyes are fatigued by strong rays of the sun. If done during these times, it will lead to diseases of the eyes because the Doshas get increased, spread to other sites and get liquefied. So to mitigate the Doshas, Anjana should be applied always either in the morning or in the evening when the sun is not present. 16 - 17. \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 Others say, that strong Anjana should not be applied during day, because the eye which has become weak by purgation treatment from strong herbs will be further debilitated by the presence of the sun. 18.

Instead, it produces itching, inactivity etc. Here Doshas get stagnated inside the eyes, even after Anjana therapy, due to cold effect. 22. Persons unfit for application of Anjana should not be done to persons who are Bheeta - in fear, Vamita, Virikta - who have been administered Vamana and Virechana who are hungry, Shitavegita - who have urges of urine, faeces etc., Kruddha - anger; Jvarita - during fever, when the eyes are fatigued, Shiroruk - during headache, Shoka - bouts of grief and Jagara - loss of sleep; Adurshte Arke - when the sun is fully covered with clouds, Shira Snate - after head bath, after inhalation of smoke and drinking of wine, Ajirne - during indigestion, fatigued from excess exposure to fire and sun; Divasupte - soon after sleep during day and Pipasite - when thirsty. 23 - 24.

Into the heap of Kalamushkaka, pieces of lime stone are put in. All the heaps are set on fire by making use of dried chaff of Tila plant (Sesame plant). After the heaps have been well burnt and fire has disappeared, one Drona (12,288 g) of ash of lime stone together with ash of Kalamushkaka and one and a quarter Drona (3072 g) of ash of others are taken, mixed together, dissolved well in half Bhara (48000 g) of water and cows urine separately, and filtered through a thick cloth till a slimy, reddish, clear and penetrating alkaline Astanga Hridaya Sutrasthan Page No. 344 Astanga Hridaya Sutrasthan material is obtained.

This is the mode of preparing Madhyama Kshara - alkali of medium potency . 8 - ash of shells, powder of excreta, biles etc. should not be made into a paste and added but put in powder form and taken out - filtered and thrown away.

It is sister science of Yoga. It is still a living and influencing science of prevention, treatment, and health promotion. Ayurveda has its own peculiarity. It has its own philosophy. All of which may not always exactly fit with other medical sciences. Ayurveda believes in cause-effect phenomenon. The therapies are broadly classified into - Yukti vyapasraya (use of rational therapies), Sattvavajaya (use of psychological therapies), and Daivyavyapasraya (use of Divine methods like faith healing). Today medical science has extensively studied many things, but still these ideas of Ayurveda help to a large extent. Both ancient and modern ideas should be encouraged to be studied and practiced in medical field for overall welfare of all. Practitioners and Institutions or organizations who deal with Ayurveda can have specific guidelines based on such classical texts and/or new studies or experiences. About Astanga Hridaya Sutrasthan Astanga = 8 organs (eight branches of classical Ayurveda) Hridaya = Heart (gist) Astanga Hridayam was written by Vagbhat in about 7 th century in Indian subcontinent. It is about health care. In Ayurveda there are eight (Astanga) classical specialties. The predominant two schools in Ayurveda are Charak (Medicine) and Sushruta / Dhanwantari (Surgery). This book is the summary of all the branches including Charak and Sushruta. And the Sutra-sthan, the first section, is the summary of the whole book. Hence, it can be said that this collection is the summary of whole of the classical Ayurveda. Ashtanga Hridayam is one of the important ancient Ayurvedic text books. It is one of the basic text books that are included in BAMS curriculum. This is one of the books that can make you feel you've got the book that you were looking for, if you are interested in Ayurveda, Yoga, or traditional and ancient medicine. This can be also an ample help to anyone who wishes to know ideas of people of the past, for appreciation, for critical reviews, research etc. (You may belong to general people, or doctor, or nurse, or anyone directly or indirectly involved in health care.) It was written in the time of influence of Buddhism, the author has shown respect to Hindu and Buddhist ideals. These ideas are similar to the ideas in different parts of the world in ancient times; these ideas represent a kind of summary of ancient human knowledge from all over the world. Most of these ideas are very much useful even today. Some of the ideas may sound uncomfortable or harmful to present day ideas. Some ideas are not found in practice these days, while some ideas are found practiced same as mentioned in the text, some are practiced with some modifications. In some cases it is seen that one idea of an Ayurveda scholar may vary from that of another. Such issues used to be resolved by sambhasa or logical discussions. Astanga Hridaya Sutrasthan Page No. 352 Astanga Hridaya Sutrasthan While reading this collection, Keep in the mind that: The number/s in the front or last of each paragraph indicates verse number. Reading this collection may be easier to those who already have got basic ideas of Ayurveda, or to those who want to know something of Ayurveda or ancient healing ideas. Some of the plants or animals explained in this ancient book may not be exactly translated in this translation, may be due to lack of exactly same species. Some of the terms explained in the ancient book may not have exact substitute in English. Some sorts of faults in translation can be traced, such as the translator may translate 'dravy' to be 'herb', but it can sometimes denote other substances to which either may be herb or metal or liquid or grain, that either may be used as medicine or as supplement or as food or as other sort of substance in the view of therapy. The word Vasti may also be written as Basti, Svedana as Swedana etc, Standard way of transliterating Sanskrit verses has not been strictly followed.(We shall try to do so in coming days) Almost all the translation has been included, excepts if any mistakenly unlisted lines exist; but not all the original slokas in 'devnagari' are listed. Most of the botanical/Latin/scientific names of species have not been italicized. (May be tried in next correction) A usual mistake during translation can be like use of general male tone like using 'he' to denote a person. It can be boring to a feminist. If s/he wants to make the reading comfortable s/he can replace those terms by proper feminist or neutral pronoun, in most of the times as long as the meaning does not get distorted. Some of the ideas may just be focused from the point of view of males, it should not be bothered, but there are some separate sections in Ayurveda which focuses on Female and child health called Kaumarbhrittya. (In ancient Ayurveda the word Purusha denotes anyone (male or female) who is the subject under consideration. However, Purusha in Nepali or Hindi general term denotes to male.) While using ideas in the book, it is good to take help from the Ayurveda scholar who has good level of knowledge and experience- so that we can prevent ourselves from wrong doing. While compiling this book, immense help from following webs and blogs were taken.
