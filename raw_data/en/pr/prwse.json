An Oklahoma State University program is working to combat that trend by inspiring the next generation of research scholars and expanding the field of One Health research. The 2023 Summer Research Training Program concluded earlier in August when 18 OSU College of Veterinary Medicine students attended the Veterinary Scholars Symposium in Puerto Rico. The 12-week paid research experience offers mentored training for veterinary students in biomedical research. \"I'm proud of our college's involvement in this program and commitment to developing student researchers,\" said Dr. Carlos Risco, CVM dean. \"Together, we are fostering the next generation of scientific leaders who will drive innovation, solve complex health challenges and make a lasting impact on the world.\" \"Across the veterinary community, we are seeing a decline in the number of clinical scholars. This program is preparing our students to become the next generation of skilled clinical scholars.\" The SRTP provides an avenue for students to explore research opportunities and gain hands-on experience while working to address society's greatest challenges through transdisciplinary research fields, such as One Health. \"The research conducted at the CVM uniquely places us at the intersection of animal and human health, fully embracing the One Health concept that is a crucial part of OSU's strategic plan,\" said Dr. Josh Butcher, veterinary physiological sciences assistant professor and SRTP committee chair. \"As such, the mentors we choose to place our students with for their summer experience have a broad diversity of research.\" This year, the program included topics such as exotic animal metabolism, human viral and bacterial infections, disease detection and treatment in production animals, and vaccine development. Breaking down the research Third-year veterinary student Paige Johnson's study focused on the inflammatory response of COVID-19. The study characterized the signaling pathway the SARS-CoV-2 virus membrane protein uses to cause an inflammatory response in macrophage cells. The goal of studying these pathways is to advance therapeutics to combat the severe inflammatory response of COVID-19 that often leads to mortality. For Johnson, this experience made her think differently about her future career. \"My experience in the program was overwhelmingly positive and changed the entire course of my professional career,\" Johnson said. \"I plan to pursue a dual DVM/Ph.D., a path I never would've imagined myself taking before this program.\" Johnson is grateful for the guidance and support of her principal investigator throughout the program. \"My biggest takeaways were that you can always learn more, apply more and think outside the box when it comes to both research and practicing as a veterinarian,\" Johnson said. Sydney Lubbers, a third-year veterinary student, conducted research on Herpes Simplex Virus-1, an important human pathogen that can cause serious ocular disease or encephalitis. Lubbers said this program opened her eyes to the depth of the veterinary medical field and allowed her to learn more about academic and industry opportunities she hadn't considered before. In the future, Lubbers is hoping to find a career path that allows her to conduct research and apply it to the clinical setting. The SRTP allowed her to gain experience in a lab while networking with practicing veterinarians who are also doing research. \"At its core, the program is an opportunity for our veterinary students to become a part of the cutting-edge research programs here at OSU and take part in multiple professional development opportunities,\" Butcher said. A networking opportunity Along with completing a research project, the program includes weekly seminars where students can interact with OSU faculty and industry leaders. Topics include careers in veterinary medicine, internships, residencies and dual degree programs. \"As part of our accreditation by the American Veterinary Medical Association and its Council on Education, we are expected to maintain a robust program of research that integrates with and strengthens the professional program,\" said Dr. Jerry Malayer, CVM senior associate dean for research. \"For 25 years, the SRTP has been one of the centerpieces of this effort. The program continues to grow in strength with remarkable quality and productivity shown in the projects.\" In fulfillment of OSU's accreditation requirements and dedication to the land-grant mission, the CVM provides opportunities for students to grow their skills and make a lasting impact on animal and human health. Butcher said funding partners play a vital role in providing this opportunity and the entire committee, including Drs. Jo\u00e3o Brand\u00e3o and Rudra Channappanavar, and the students are extremely grateful for their support. Sponsors for the SRTP include Boehringer Ingelheim, Institute for Translational and Emerging Research in Advanced Comparative Therapy, Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, College of Arts and Sciences, and College of Veterinary Medicine departments and dean's office.
