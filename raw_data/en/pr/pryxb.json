{"title": "Prospect of nanomaterials as antimicrobial and antiviral regimen", "author": "Ashok Chakraborty; Anil Diwan; Jayant Tatake", "url": "http://www.aimspress.com/rticle/doi/10.3934/microbiol.2023024", "hostname": "aimspress.com", "description": "In recent years studies of nanomaterials have been explored in the field of microbiology due to the increasing evidence of antibiotic resistance. Nanomaterials could be inorganic or organic, and they may be synthesized from natural products from plant or animal origin. The therapeutic applications of nano-materials are wide, from diagnosis of disease to targeted delivery of drugs. Broad-spectrum antiviral and antimicrobial activities of nanoparticles are also well evident. The ratio of nanoparticles surface area to their volume is high and that allows them to be an advantageous vehicle of drugs in many respects. Effective uses of various materials for the synthesis of nanoparticles impart much specificity in them to meet the requirements of specific therapeutic strategies. The potential therapeutic use of nanoparticles and their mechanisms of action against infections from bacteria, fungi and viruses were the focus of this review. Further, their potential advantages, drawbacks, limitations and side effects are also included here. Researchers are characterizing the exposure pathways of nano-medicines that may cause serious toxicity to the subjects or the environment. Indeed, societal ethical issues in using nano-medicines pose a serious question to scientists beyond anything.", "sitename": "AIMS Microbiology", "date": "2023-01-05", "cleaned_text": "| [1] || Sethi S, Murphy TF (2001) Bacterial infection in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2000: a state-of-the-art et al.
