Some e xamples of Coronavirus prevention or treatment claim s include : On a page o n your website titled \"THYMOSIN ALPHA-1 AND COVID-19, \" you state: 45 Urgent Care, P.C./Advanced Rehab and Medical, P.C. November 30, 2020 Page 2 \"Thymosin Alpha -1 is a peptide chain that is made by the body. Its purpose is to help regulate the immune system by augmenting the function of the cells that fight off infections. Studies have shown that Thymosin Alpha -1 helps fight off viruses, bacteria, and fungal infections. It also modulates the immune system to f ight cancer cells, make vaccines more effective, and kill cells that are unhealthy and are no longer useful to the body. This peptide can be produced in a compounding pharmacy and used as natural therapy to enhance our immunity and prevent infections. The peptide is FDA approved and is injected into the fat under the skin twice a week for prevention, or more frequently for an active infection. Because the compounded version of this peptide is identical to that made by the body, there are few, if any, side effects. 45 Urgent Care is introducing a new service that includes the use of Thymosin Alpha -1 as both a preventive measure and a treatment for viral infections. We are currently prescribing it to treat patients who are COVID -19 positive because of its know n effectiveness against viruses. If you are interested in learning more about this treatment and how it might enhance your health, call 731 -868-4609 today for an appointment! We are open Monday through Saturday 8am to 8pm.

Just wanted to take a quick moment to talk about our Immune Support and what we're doing during the Covid crisis and coming upon flu season to help boost the immune system so that your body can fight back if you are to come in contact with the viruses or bacteria for that matter. We do have a packet in our office that has been set up with this in mind. It has four items in it. The first one is Immunitone . . . it has got Echinacea, green tea, elderberry in it as well as some more stuff that helps support the immune system. The ImmunoBerry liquid . . . it has obviously elderberry and a root from China that actually helps to increase antibody response and activate CD4 counts which is a really important piece of our immune system response when we are fighting antibodies and bacteria. Also has wild black cherry bark in it that has an antioxidant effect so that it decreases inflammation as we fight our viruses, bacteria, whatever happens to be foreign in our system. The next one is zinc - we've heard a lot in the news about zinc. Zinc is actually being us ed as part of a treatment plan for people with Covid -19 but what it does is it increases the immunity by strengthening the walls of the cells so that viruses can't just get into those cells and infiltrate and cause a disease process. So everybody needs to be taking zinc. The fourth one and the last one is Monolaurin- Avail it has a lot of different things in it. It has antiviral properties as well as it can act as a natural form of an antibiotic without causing antibody resistance with the bacteria or the virus that you are trying to fight. This also contains vitamin C which is an important part of the immune system. All of these together is $125. . . not a bad price to stay healthy this season, come by and ask for our immune support packet.\" [September 3, 2020 post at https://www.facebook.com/45urgentcarejackson ; video also posted on the 45 Urgent Care YouTube channel at https://www.yo utube.com/watch?v=rkEOwB2QBzU ] 45 Urgent Care, P.C./Advanced Rehab and Medical, P.C.
