Low energy or occasional fatigue can be a drag on your day, especially if it takes away from your productivity at work, at home, or out at a social event. If you're tired in the afternoon, the stimulation of an [energy drink](/wellness/supplements/taurine-benefits) may not be the best choice\u2014especially if you want to sleep well and wake feeling refreshed the next day. But [certain herbs](/wellness/supplements/10-vitamins-and-supplements-for-energy) may help. Rather than giving you a big push, herbs work in a more supportive way, promoting healthy energy without the big ups and downs of caffeine and other stimulants. And most of them are easy to add to your daily routine to give you the gentle boost you need. What causes a lack of energy? There are plenty of reasons you might be having a slow day. Some of the most common culprits for fatigue include the following: - Poor or inadequate sleep: Getting a [good night's sleep](/wellness/sleep-relaxation/10-benefits-of-getting-enough-sleep)gives your body a chance to recharge. Not only does a good rest help boost energy, it supports a healthy mood, sharp memory, stress management, a healthy weight and more! (Need some help falling asleep? [These tips](/wellness/sleep-relaxation/what-to-do-when-you-cant-sleep)may help!) - Unbalanced diet: It's hard to feel good on a diet overloaded with processed carbs, saturated fat and sugar. While an occasional treat that includes fried foods or sweet indulgences can flood our systems with happy hormones, a balanced breakfast will do a lot more for your daily energy levels than a donut or pastry will. (Setting up a [healthy pantry](/wellness/lifestyle/healthy-pantry)will make it easier to \"eat clean,\" which helps support consistent energy levels.) - Lack of exercise: You might worry that going to the gym will make you more tired, but regular exercise helps you feel more energetic, not less! Regular exercise also supports the healthy sleep that is key for energy levels\u2014as well as supporting mood (thanks to the release of [endorphins](/wellness/mind-memory/how-to-release-endorphins)and other [brain chemicals](/wellness/mind-memory/happy-hormones)), cognition, focus and stress management. - Unmanaged stress: Dealing with everyday worries in a healthy manner (such as regular exercise, yoga, meditation, etc.) not only supports your mental well-being but your physical well-being, too. If you have heard people comment that you are \"running yourself ragged,\" it is no surprise that tiredness follows. - Alcohol: Drinking alcohol in moderation is key. Not only for your [liver health](/health-basics/liver-health-detoxification), but also for your mood and energy the next day. - Caffeine: The same \"moderation\" guidelines apply to caffeine intake. Too much caffeine, or drinking caffeine later in the day, can disrupt the healthy sleep patterns that are so important for energy the next day. This doesn't mean you can't enjoy your morning cup of coffee\u2014after all, coffee has antioxidants, liver health benefits and more! But the caffeine in that cup can be an issue for some. - Personal health: If you feel you are more tired than you should be on a day to day basis, [talk with your doctor](/wellness/lifestyle/how-honest-are-you-with-your-doctor)or healthcare provider. There are many reasons you may feel sluggish, and your doctor can work with you to help determine a cause. Why do I experience a midday slump? For most, that after-lunch lull is a natural part of your body's rhythm. Your sluggishness may be even more pronounced after a heavy meal, as your body diverts energy for digestion and your blood sugar and hormone levels change in response to the meal. If you are feeling fatigue, check your sleep, diet, exercise and hydration levels first. One or more of these might account for that grogginess. You may also want to try the gentle energy-boosting of herbal supplements. Not sure where to start?
