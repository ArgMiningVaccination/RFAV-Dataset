US: 1 800 643 8086 UK: 44 (0) 1509 EDITORIAL JORG GREUEL/PHOTODISC/GETTY IMAGESPharmTech.com/forum I received my pharmaceutical sciences doctorate degree 30 years ago. A gradu- ate student colleague and I were recently discussing our careers and the changes we've witnessed in the pharmaceutical industry. We both wondered whether our careers were taking place in the \"Golden Age\" of our industry or whether that time had passed us by. When graduate students completed their degree requirements in the 1980s, 1990s, or even in the early 2000s, they were frequently recruited by multiple, large drug companies. Maybe they weren't 7-foot basketball stars, but their training and the needs of pharmaceutical companies were a great match. Most students had several job offers with immediate potential for further mentoring and growth. In hindsight, there was a huge growth spurt in pharmaceutics, and companies were greatly expanding. Our scientific un- derstanding seemed to focus on simpler processes and principles. Even the dis- eases to be treated appeared less compli- cated, and certainly the drug-development paradigm was a shorter, less complex one. I guess we didn't realize how lucky we were. R&D problems have become more difficult during the past decade. As sci- ence has advanced, each step in the drug- development process has been placed under a microscope. Details that we might not have known existed previously now demand a more involved process. There is no question that our drug- development model has been refocused, and the jury is still out regarding the most efficient and productive scheme. As the pipeline and success rate for our com- pounds has dwindled, the need to main- tain the profit margins and to invest for the future has made many companies change their strategies. Drug-development models have been altered more often than any of us would like, especially when we recall the stable programs from our past. So our industry, like many others, has adopted a \"change\" mantra. One could eas- ily argue that the changes have been revo- lutionary, just as Kodak has experienced in the photography business. Fortunately, the pharmaceutical industry has been able to keep its feet somewhat on the ground. Not just hundreds, but thousands of colleagues have found this footing slippery, however, because of various mergers and layoffs. Large companies have struggled with their business models, facing patent expi- rations and adverse cost and payment sce- narios, among other concerns. The new graduate is struggling to find a job with brand-name companies. There are larger, more interactive, global components of research necessary to bring a new drug to the market. And the diseases themselves are much more difficult to overcome. All of us know, for example, that there is not one simple cure for cancer, although that may have been the na\u00efve goal of scientists 30-40 years ago. But new growth areas\u2014that is, small- and mid-sized pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations\u2014are filling the void for job-seekers. Many col- leges of pharmacy, such as the Universi- ties of Texas, Kentucky, and Kansas, have established research institutes to more closely align their research efforts with the private sector. We have learned that it takes cooperation across boundaries where only quiet competition and stiff regulation once existed. Sharing nonproprietary informa- tion and working collaboratively with FDA are more commonplace. And our scientific abilities and volume of information pro- duced have advanced. There are certainly many hurdles yet to clear. It's important during these times of transition to keep abreast of trends in cutting-edge science and to collaborate with colleagues to identify novel solutions. Sessions at the 2011 AAPS Annual Meet- ing and Exposition (Oct. 23-27) will look toward addressing current and future in- dustry challenges. Keynote speaker Janet Woodcock, di- rector of FDA's Center for Drug Evalu- ation and Research, will provide her views on regulation. The plenary session featuring John Lechleiter, president and chief executive officer of Eli Lilly and Company; Francis S. Collins, director of the US National Institutes of Health; and Sir Michael Rawlins, chairman of the United Kingdom's National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, will focus on the future of global pharma- ceutical industry, current research that may lead to new therapies, and the cost/ benefit of these therapies. Our health demands that new hypoth- eses and possible treatments be investigated to heal patients and save lives. The need to do this as a larger human objective is the core mission of our industry. There are cures for a healthy world yet to be found which we can collectively improve to ex- tend meaningful lives of patients. As long as we continue to search scientifically, dili- gently, and efficiently for these cures, the future of the pharmaceutical industry still burns bright. PTAdvancing with the Times Despite new hurdles, industry must continue to move forward and fulfill its mission.Philip R. Mayer Philip R. Mayer, PhD, is president of the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.PharmTech.com/forum See us at AAPS, Booth 222914 Pharmaceutical Technology OCtOber 2011 PharmTech.comPharmTech Talk AUGUST STEIN/PHOTODISC/GETTY IMAGES PharmTech.com/forumNoncompliance: human Nature? Angie Drakulich There were lots of subtle and not-so- subtle messages about industry's failure to comply with basic GMPs brought up during the PDA-FDA joint regulatory conference last month in Wash-ington, DC. FDA speakers made it clear that the most common GMP inspection citations have not changed much in the past decade, suggesting that industry has not yet gotten its act together. Most observations found by inspectors continue to be tied to the quality control unit and overall defi- ciencies in quality management systems. And as we have learned during the past few months, these types of deficiencies can lead to drug recalls and ultimately, drug shortages, a major public-health concern. A few conference participants brought up the notion that \"to comply\" is to go against human nature. It's much more natural, they suggested, to try and hide a mistake or to rely on one's own opinions about how things ought to be done, as op- posed to following a set of rules. It's not so much defiance that is causing quality prob- lems, however, as is a lack of training, they added. For example, if someone in the test- ing department does not understand why he cannot walk into a sterile room with regular shoes on, why would he make a big deal out of doing so? In many cases, employees just don't understand why cer- tain procedures must be followed and what the consequences are for not doing so. One FDA speaker pointed to a small company of 10 employees that was recently found to have not undergone any GMP training. So the larger elephant in the conference room was the fact that industry senior management needs to take a more proac- tive role in understanding and explaining quality GMPs and risk-based approaches to all employees, at all sites. The patient\u2014 rather than the bottom line\u2014must be in the minds and goals of management at all times in order for a sense of ownership and responsibility to trickle down. One audi- ence member even suggested renaming Good Manufacturing Practice to be Good Management Practice. I expect we'll hear more on this topic in the future.

For example, for one product, the sequence is to make the nonsterile bulk and take a bioburden sample. While the bioburden sample is being tested (three days), we sterile- filter the lot and fill the lot into vials. The filtration-and-filling process usu- ally takes 1 to 2 days. So by the time the test is done, the product is in vials. \"In this case, the investigation in- cluded sampling equipment for germs and reviewing cleaning records and validation data. Because the sampling for germs takes three days to grow out, more product is processed in the mean- time. We found the cause of the con- tamination, which was a defective bot- tom valve on the bulk vessel. But by that time we had four more lots processed through that vessel and we had four more bioburden failures. The bioburden results were so high that we couldn't jus- tify the sterility after filtration and the lots were rejected.\" it wasn't all it was cracked up to be \"I hate complaints,\" complained our GMP Agent-In-Place. \"We have a product that is sold with a diluent and cracks were found in the diluent vials. (The product was fine.) When we inspected the returned vials, cracks were found to be caused by seam overlap from the glass-molding process, and were not related to the general suit-ability of the vial. We were relieved, but more complaints rolled in. Additional complaints were for cracks caused by our manufacturing and packaging process. The diluent, unlike the product, is steam sterilized in an autoclave. Because of the numerous manufacturing-related com- plaints that came in, we ultimately recalled the lot of diluent that was used in several product shipments. Ouch.\" Running the gauntlet \"Of all the rotten lousy things to happen during an FDA inspection,\" our GMP Agent-In-Place groused, \"it was sticky beads. We were manufacturing time- release beads, which need to be coated to slow their dissolution rate. The coating process hadn't gone smoothly, and some beads were sticking together and forming clumps. Our operator moved them out of the coating pan and through a screen to remove the clumps. He had a face mask on and was using gloved hands and gauntlets to push the beads through the screen be- fore they hardened. \"The FDA inspector noted that little bits of Teflon from the gauntlets seemed to be flaking off into the beads and through the screen. The supervi-sor immediately asked the operator to replace the gauntlets and not to rub them on the screen, but the damage was done,\" sighed our agent. \"The product was contaminated and there was no good way to rework it. We re- jected the batch.\" Seeing through the haze \"New staff in our tablet-granulation area were given safety briefings and the batch- manufacturing records were updated to list the required safety equipment,\" our GMP Agent-In-Place began. \"But new employees hated dust masks because they got soggy, and with little dust in- volved in this particular product process, they elected not to wear them. Supervi- sors and experienced employees let this go as a way to haze the new staff. The next day, the new employees complained about flushing and heart palpitations, which tend to be side effects of a high dose of this product. \"The product was sold to another company 15 years ago. Do they haze their new employees the same way?\" wondered our agent.

Report from: India India is setting out to woo China in an effort to improve its own pharmaceutical- manufacturing sector. Although China is one of the largest trading partners of India, relations between the two nations have not been completely amenable, and China continues to stand ahead of its neighboring nation statistically. Government data show that bilateral trade was $61.74 billion in 2010. The same year, India's trade deficit with China was at $20.02 billion; it was $15.87 billion in 2009. With Indian pharmaceutical exports surging at 16% growth this year and set to cross the $12-billion mark, India is hoping that its pharmaceutical exports from India to China will also grow. Earlier this year, the Chinese government decided to open up its $50-billion phar- maceutical market and provide universal healthcare to the country's population, with a target date of 2020. To reach this goal, the government will need to source pharmaceuticals\u2014and India is eagerly waiting to benefit from the expected growth. contin. on page 20A.

He specifically advocated for the Chinese Health Ministry to improve its lengthy registration procedure, which often discourages Indian companies from trying to enter the Chinese market. Industry perspectives \"With regard to raw materials for the pharmaceutical sector, China is the world leader in basic raw materials today. They are also the masters in terms of APIs. If it is necessary for India to develop these areas, we have to partner [with] China,'' says Mumbai-based Cipla Chairman Yusuf K. Hamied. In 2010, Cipla committed to investing approximately $70 million in China over a 3-year timeframe. The company is try- ing to beat out competition from Bangalore-based Biocon, biologic drugs worth more than $80 to $90 billion in global sales are set to lose patent protection, presenting a major opportunity. We want to be a part of this in China,\" said Hamied. On June 15, 2010, Cipla acquired a 25% stake in Shanghai- based BioMab, a biotech company. The investment, in coordina- tion with the Desano Group in Shanghai (a supplier of anti-HIV and antimalarial APIs), will involve the establishment of two monoclonal antibody manufacturing plants, one in Goa and one in Shanghai. Looking forward, Hamied says Cipla plans to de- velop top-selling innovator products account for $19 billion in annual revenue. It has not always been easy for Indian firms to maintain a hold in China, however. Gurgaon, Haryana-based Ranbaxy was one of the first Indian companies to establish a venture in China, in 1993. According to a Ranbaxy official who preferred anonymity, a major part of Ranbaxy's sourcing used to come from China. \"The idea then was to secure increased market share for our innovative drugs and also use the initiative to source interme- diaries to cut down production costs,\" he said. However, in De- cember 2009, after launching more than 40 products in China, Ranbaxy divested its stake in the ventures it had with Guang- zhou-based Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Company and Hong Kong-based New Chemic. Ranbaxy said the move was part of a cost-saving consolidation of manufacturing operations. The Japa- nese firm Daiichi Sankyo, Ranbaxy's parent company, wanted to cut down unprofitable ventures and wanted exclusive control in China, not through a subsidiary. The same month, Ranbaxy dissolved its Japanese joint venture with Nippon Chemiphar as well, at the behest of Daiichi. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories and Chennai-based Orchid Chemi- cals and Pharmaceuticals have forayed into China as well, but with mixed results. In July 2000, Dr. Reddy's signed an agreement with two firms to establish a joint-venture company in China named Kunshan Rotam Reddy Pharmaceutical Company. The agreement, with the Rotam Group of Canada and Kunshan Double Crane Pharmaceutical of China, had a total starting in- vestment of $29.99 million. \"Though the [joint venture] was to produce and repackage bulk formulations and APIs, the Indian firm has not made much headway in China,\" said Sunder Mo- hanty, principal pharmaceutical analyst at the brokerage firm, India Infoline. Mohanty says a similar situation occurred with Orchid Chem- icals and Pharmaceuticals. The company set up a $25-million 50-50 joint venture in 2002 with North China Pharmaceutical Corporation. The goal was to tap into the market potential for anti-infective drugs in China with an envisaged a 300-million ton bulk active drugs per year manufacturing capacity. Nine years later, however, the venture activity is diluted and Orchid now re- lies on supplying chemicals and contract work focused on custom synthesis and analysis. Government views Until recently, India produced 70% of its bulk-drug needs, but that figure has now fallen to 30%. A Commerce Ministry state- ment of July 16, 2011, notes that the Indian government is worried that the amount of cheap bulk-drug imports from China have led to a sharp fall in the share of domestic production. Some have called India's low-export penetration into China embarrassing, including P.V. Appaji, executive director of Phar- mexcil, the Indian government's pharmaceutical export promo- tion council. \"Take a look at how China is supporting its bulk drug industry,\" Appaji says. \"With financial incentives worth $75 million, foreign multinationals are keen to set up base there. In India, though Big Pharma tends to form close collaborations, such as risk-sharing outsourcing to codevelop drug candidates, very few of them are willing to permanently set up a decent size R&D center here. In order to retain our export advantage, we need to think like China and counter multinationals at their own game.\" India's Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma has also gone on record to express disappointment over China not fulfilling its promise of importing more pharmaceutical products from India. In August 2010, at the 8th meeting of the India-China Joint Economic Group, China had assured India that it would give India access through government contracts in sectors like pharmaceuticals and IT. In a statement to India's Parliament on Aug. 24, 2011, Sharma expressed concern that a year had gone by without China fulfilling its promise to import more. He said the matter would be taken up for discussions again with China. The two nations are planning a series of talks, to begin Sept. 26, 2011, to shape a framework for enhanced economic coop- eration in the pharmaceutical, technology, energy, steel, and telecommunication sectors. A goal of the so-called Strategic Economic Dialogue is to figure out how to grow bilateral trade to reach $100 billion by 2015. Discussions will focus, among other topics, on enhancing exchange and cooperation of phar- maceutical API plant supervision. A.

The focus group is advo- cating for the inclusion of global health topics in all AAPS activities, including programming at meetings, strengthen- ing networking opportunities among members and other professional orga- nizations, and promoting educational and training programs for students about global health. The focus group grew out of a larger AAPS task force on global health, and after speaking to the chair-elect, Kishor M. Wasan, it's clear that this group is not only serious about its goals, but also extremely passionate about why it's focusing on global health. Wasan is a professor and distinguished univer- sity scholar in pharmaceutical sciences at the University of British Columbia in Canada, and the director and co- founder of the university's Neglected Global Diseases Initiative. \"Now is the time to have this discus- sion and this group,\" says Wasan, offer- ing a host of reasons why. Industry\u2014 and the world, for that matter\u2014have changed dramatically during the past 15 years or so, he explains. For starters, the influx in the late 1990s of nongov- ernmental organizations led to a major social change. \"We didn't have the Gates Foundation, or the Clinton initiative be- fore the 1990s. We didn't have targeted programs for diseases in developing countries, or World Health Organiza- tion indicators for fighting neglected diseases. These programs have provided global funds for research and projects that deal with worldwide infectious dis- ease and with problems that were being neglected,\" he explains. That's only half of the story. Social media has made a huge difference in bringing the world together to discuss and work on broad challenges such as global health. \"We can Skype with laboratories in Uganda, there are diag- noses being done with individuals in Kenya via cell phones, we can coordi- nate a project with people in 14 or 15 countries at a time,\" he says. And this technology has engaged young people, adds Wasan, who has witnessed first- hand in his University of British Co- lumbia students the excitement about the limitless opportunities that exist today. \"They feel the world as a closer place. They want to tackle these types of problems, and the problems are more accessible to them.\" Indeed, global diseases are starting to touch lives in the developed world. Air travel, for example, has brought some new parasitic cases from developing countries into developed countries. But there's also a larger concern today for diseases that affect developing nations because the world's economies are so integrated. \"If China, for instance, has some serious health issues, it's going to affect their productivity, which affects our productivity,\" explains Wasan. \"It's beneficial to everyone to improve health on a global level.\" For all these reasons, Big Pharma has decided that it wants global health and access programs, says Wasan. He admits that there are some politics that have gone into this decision, but at the end of the day, industry is doing more to saves lives, he says Wasan. Some of the target areas that the AAPS Pharmaceuticals in Global Health Focus Group plans to address through edu- cational and networking programs in- clude: the development of treatments, vaccines, and diagnostics for neglected diseases; assuring the quality and safety of active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug products that are produced and sold throughout the world; the development of vaccine formulations that are stable without a cold chain; small-molecule formulations that can withstand the rig- ors of tropical environments; and assur- ing that developing-country populations have access to routinely used vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics. A key component of the focus group's work, explains Wasan, is to highlight the technical aspects of global health efforts. \"Eighty percent of our members are in- dustrial scientists,\" he says. \"They want to know, for example, how to make a drug that is stable in a tropical environ- ment. They want to know how to make an oral formulation versus a parenteral (which also can be applied to countries in the developed world). Overall, our goal is to address the global healthcare and pharmaceutical issue while also tackling topics that are of interest to the scientific community so that they can apply what they've learned.\" AAPS plans to address these chal- lenges through one of the most basic forms of communication\u2014dialogue. \"We have all these groups coming to meetings and we have members around the globe,\" says Wasan. \"Innovation oc- curs by people talking, and we can co- ordinate that.\" The focus group also plans to get young people involved. \"These prob- lems are not going to be solved in our lifetime,\" says Wasan. \"They are genera- tional, and the kids who are in school now are going to be the ones that will have the energy to carry out solutions.\" The next global health focus group meeting is taking place at the October 2011 AAPS annual meeting in Wash- ington, DC.

The shortages affect many necessary drugs, including those for can- cer, anesthesia, influenza, and other critical conditions. In 2010, there were 178 drug shortages reported to FDA, 132 of which involved sterile injectable drugs, according the agency's frequently asked questions website for its Drug Shortages program. So far this year, there has been \"an increasing number of shortages, especially those involving older sterile injectable drugs, \" according to the site. \"All parties involved in the supply of drugs to Americans have a respon- sibility to make sure patients have access to the drugs they need, \" states an FDA press release on the subject. The agency intends to release a report in the coming weeks that ana- lyzes the problem and provides recommendations. \"One suggestion is a mechanism for manufacturers to report impending supply disruptions and discontinuation of drugs, which could help to curb drug shortages and improve the continuity of the drug supply, \" according to the press release. \"Meanwhile, the FDA will continue its efforts to work with manufactur- ers to ameliorate shortages. For example, FDA already expedites requests to qualify new manufacturing sites, new production lines or new raw-material suppliers to avert drug shortages. HHS remains committed to working with manufacturers, providers, patient advocates, and other stakeholders to help minimize drug shortages, protect patients, and identify solutions to this seri- ous problem, \" said the statement. As PharmTech went to press, FDA held a public workshop on Sept. 26, 2011, in Silver Spring, Maryland, to further discuss drug shortages and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's approach for addressing them. The causes and effects of drug shortages, as well as possible strategies for preventing or mitigating them, were to be discussed.FDA released its new enforcement strategy in August 2010.

The first is a proposal to reduce the period of exclusivity for biologics from the current 12 years to seven years. In addition, the practice of evergreen- ing\u2014extending the exclusivity period by making minor changes in product formulation\u2014would be prohibited. According to the report, \"The Administration's proposal strikes a balance between promoting affordable access to medications and encouraging innovation to develop needed therapies. The proposal will result in $3.5 billion in savings over 10 years to federal health programs including Medicare and Medicaid. \" Another provision would give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to prohibit pay-for-delay agreements, in which a manufac- turer of an innovator product pays to delay the entry of a generic drug onto the market. The proposal is intended to increase patient access to generic drugs and biologics, and the administration projects that the policy would save federal health programs $2.7 billion over 10 years. Also included in the plan is a proposal to align Medicare drug- payment policies with Medicaid policies for low-income beneficiaries. The plan would require the same drug rebates that are offered to Medicaid recipients to be offered under Medicare Part D. It is esti- mated that the policy change would result in $135 billion in savings over 10 years. \u00bbFollow us on Twitter @PharmTechGroup for the latest news, blog posts, and conference updates.Pharmaceutical Technology OctOber 2011 25IN THE FIELD Zone in on: Manufacturing ISPE to Publish Updated Sterile-Product Manufacturing Guide Erik Greb The International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering (ISPE) will soon publish an update to its guide to sterile-product manufacturing facilities. The new publication will replace the original guide, ISPE Baseline Guide: Sterile-Product Manufacturing Facilities, and contain practical information about technological advances in sterile manu- facturing. The updated guide will be a complete revision of the original version and include new information on various topics, including restricted-access barrier systems and isolator technology, facility design, best practices for terminally sterilized and aseptically pro- cessed sterile products, and updated guidance on quality attributes of construction and finishes for various grades of facility. The guide also will include diagrams and detailed text to explain and compare GMP requirements. ISPE intends the new publication to help person- nel develop compliant manufacturing solutions and to propose vari- ous routes for achieving compliance.The organization revised the guide with an international audience in mind. The update will tabulate, explain, and compare the cleanli- ness designations found in guidance documents from FDA, EMA, and the International Organization for Standardization. The guide is intended to improve harmonization in global facility design and foster international regulatory compliance. The new document will include ISPE's recommendations for complying with the latest FDA and EMA guidance. \"When the original Guide was released in 1999, it met a need in the marketplace by providing a comprehensive resource to help interpret and implement FDA regulations with respect to design and operations used for the manufacture of sterile pharmaceutical products, \" said Bruce Davis, leader of the team responsible for the update, in a press release. \"However, as technology advanced, aseptic processing in manned cleanrooms was no longer considered cur- rent GMP , and ISPE began tracking and communicating new, better methods of sterile manufacturing design, \" he added. The update will consolidate all of ISPE's latest best-practice recommendations on sterile manufacturing facility design. ISPE is a not-for-profit association of 22,000 pharmaceutical pro- fessionals in 90 countries. Members collaborate to provide GMP solu- tions, and the organization works with global regulatory agencies and industry leaders.

The system rapidly characterizes the size and con- centration of nanoscale protein aggregation in the presence of a large, nonaggregated protein population. Users can distinguish labeled particles from each other using the technique's fluorescence mode. The software measures the concentra- tion of virus or viruslike-particles more quickly than the plaque-assay tech- nique does, according to Patrick Hole, head of development at NanoSight. Unlike other particle-sizing soft- ware, the NTA software gives the user a visual validation of the source of the raw data, thus allowing him or her to identify potential measurement problems easily. The software com- plies with 21 CFR Part 11 by protect- ing recorded data from tampering, attributing data to individual users, and restricting certain functions to supervisors.Bioprocess analyzer ensures proper protein production conditions Roche's Cedex Bio Bioprocess Analyzer is a continuous random-access instrument that enables the safe and reliable determination of chemical and biochemical parameters in aqueous solutions.

The Centers for Disease Control and Pre - vention (CDC) expect to have more vaccin e available this season\u2014166 million dosage s versus 157 million in the 2010-2011 seaso n \u2014and have launched a major campaig n to vaccinate more healthcare workers an d pregnant women. Last year, about 42% o f Americans were immunized, more tha n usual, but still far below the 80% goal set b y the federal government. While the vaccin e community won plaudits for respondin g quickly to the 2009-2010 influenza pan - demic, the World Health Organizatio n (WHO) came under fire for slow distribu - tion of vaccines in poor countries, as wel l as charges that it hyped the danger of th e epidemic to boost drug company sales. A blue-ribbon panel rejected those charges , but the debate reveals the highly-charge d political environment surrounding im - munization programs . Vaccines have even made it into the Re - publican presidential race. Texas Governo r Rick Perry publicly disavowed his earlie r backing of the human papillomaviru s (HPV) vaccine for all young girls. Perr y signed an executive order in 2007 man - dating that all sixth-grade girls in Texa s receive Merck's Gardasil vaccine to preven t cervical cancer. Now, candidate Perry say s he made a mistake\u2014an about-face that re - flects concerns raised by social conserva - tives about vaccine mandates overall, an d specifically about endorsing a preventiv e for a sexually-transmitted disease . Other important developments this yea r brought good news to vaccine producer s and advocates. The US Supreme Cour t ruled in February that manufacturer s cannot be sued in state courts for injurie s allegedly caused by their products. Th e case,Bruesewitz v. Wyet h (Feb. 22, 2011) , should discourage plaintiffs from tryin g to circumvent the protections created b y the 1986 National Childhood Vaccin e Injury Act, which provides compensatio n from the industry-funded Vaccine Injur y Compensation Program (VCIP) to patient s claiming injury from vaccines. This federa l pre-emption of state-based injury suits i s crucial for protecting manufacturers fro m costly tort litigation that would drive the m from the vaccine business . The high court's decision came on th e heels of reports fully discrediting earlie r studies linking vaccines and autism, a claim that has plagued vaccine makers fo r years. Th e British Medical Journa l pub-lished a series of articles by journalist Bria n Deer documenting that data published i n a 1998 paper by British physician Andre w Wakefield and colleagues was not just ba d science, but deliberate fraud (1) .

Increased investment Despite lingering safety issues, vaccine research and new product development is expanding, generating optimism for new discoveries that will guard against AIDS, cancer, and multiple infectious diseases. Led by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foun-dation, which has committed more than $10 billion to support vaccine innovation, donor nations are boosting support for global vaccine R&D. Researchers anticipate that a dozen new vaccines may be rolled out in the next decade against diseases such as typhoid, malaria, and dengue fever. Gates has signed up the world-famous Barcelona soccer team to promote polio eradication, despite fears of some health authorities that complete elimination of the disease is too difficult and costly. The journal Health Affairs discussed strategies for achieving Gates' \"Decade of Vaccines\" in a special June 2011 issue that explores new vaccines in the pipeline along with new models for financing and paying for vaccine development and delivery. The promise is that investing more in immu- nization science and expanding vaccine distribution globally will reduce healthcare costs, promote economic activity, and save the lives of more than 6 million children through 2020. Pharmaceutical manufacturers now regard vaccines as a potential source of steady revenue, if not blockbuster profits. The world market for preventive vaccines exceeded $20 billion in 2009 and grew to nearly $30 billion in 2010. Projections call for 10% annual growth during the next five years due to new product introduc- tions and broader use. Expanded global production of seasonal flu vaccine is set- ting the pace: by 2015, WHO predicts that some 37 vaccine makers will be able to pro- duce 1.7 billion doses of influenza vaccine, enough to handle any pandemic. Merck, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Sanofi Pasteur, Pfizer, and Novartis dominate the market and continue to invest in the field. A main target of vaccine research is the development of new treatments for third- world diseases. A new meningitis A vac- cine has been distributed to more than 19 million people in West Africa, providing a model for collaboration to produce and distribute a vaccine that costs less than 50 cents. Sanofi Pasteur is testing the first vaccine for dengue fever, which sickens some 2 million children a year, primarily in Latin America and Asia. Researchers have begun early clinical trials for a new vaccine for tuberculosis, with initial results expected next year. Colorado-based Invi- ragen is collaborating with the University of Texas and federal agencies to develop a novel recombinant chikungunya virus vaccine. Vaccines are under development for schistosomiasis, hookworm, rabies, and Ebola virus. Earlier this year, Merck and Britain's Wellcome Trust announced a joint project to design an oral rotavirus vaccine that will be cheaper and easier to use than current shots. Several groups are working on new malaria vaccine projects. The most ad- The Smartest Distance Between T wo Points.

The most advanced is GSK's RTS,S vaccine candidate, now in Phase III studies in Africa under the auspices of the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative. In addition, the Infectious Diseases Research Institute (IDRI) is collaborating with the US Agency for International Development and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Re- search to develop an antimalarial vaccine that combines new antigens. Despite numerous failures in develop- ing an AIDS vaccine, scientists remain optimistic that success is possible. Re- searchers point to advances in under- standing the complexities of an AIDS vaccine and are developing new vectors, delivery technologies, adjuvants, and im- mune assays to address these challenges. For example, the International AIDS Vac- cine Initiative (IA VI), Scripps Research Institute, and several biotech companies recently reported the isolation of novel antibodies capable of neutralizing a broad spectrum of variants of HIV. Researchers were encouraged that this could provide new targets for the design of vaccine can- didates that can elicit similar antibodies to protect against the virus. New cancer vaccines are on everyone's wish list, encouraged by success in develop- ing HPV vaccines for cervical cancer and the prostate cancer treatment, Dendreon's Provenge. A recent announcement from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, cites plans for Phase I clinical trials for new vaccines to prevent the recurrence of ovar- ian and breast cancer. Bioterrorism threats also are spurring vaccine development. Last year, the HHS Biomedical Advanced Research and De- velopment Authority (BARDA) awarded approximately $50 million to organiza- tions seeking to reduce the time and cost of testing new medical countermeasures. Projects aim to increase the shelf life of in- fluenza vaccine stockpiles for future use in a pandemic and to develop adjuvant for- mulations to enhance influenza vaccine immunogenicity and cross-protection to new viral strains. BARDA is providing Emergent BioSolutions with $100 million over several years to develop a state-of- the-art production facility for its anthrax vaccine. More than $1 billion in contracts during the past six years have gone to man- ufacturers developing cell-based technol- ogy for seasonal influenza production, plus recombinant technology and adjuvented influenza vaccines. The expectation is that these innovations will foster development of other commercial products and medical countermeasures, such as next-generation smallpox vaccine. Price and access Vaccine development generates tension among companies regarding how to make R&D profitable enough to encour- age private-sector investment while also being able to offer sufficiently low prices to make products available to poor nations. While public health officials admit that the most cost-effective vaccine is one that's free, the stated goal is to provide emerg- ing markets with vaccines that cost less than $5 per dose.

In response, manufacturers are cutting prices significantly on vaccines for developing na- tions. At a June 2011 meeting in London to secure donor funding for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), India-based manufacturers prom- ised a record low $1.75 per dose price for pentavalent vaccines that protect against five diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, pertus- sis, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influen- zae type b (HIB). GSK and Merck reduced rates on rotavirus and HPV vaccines, and other leading manufacturers announced similar moves. GAVI will have the funds to purchase these more affordable products because the Gates Foundation and major donor nations pledged $4.3 billion in June to support its international immunization program. The UK led the list with a $1.3 billion pledge, followed by Gates, Nor- way, the US, and several other countries. Japan and Brazil gave for the first time this year. This support helped GAVI fend off criticism from international relief or- ganizations that it does not do enough to negotiate lower prices for vaccines, allegedly because of too-close ties to big vaccine makers. GAVI also responded by appointing Seth Berkley to head the organization, a prominent AIDS vaccine researcher who has campaigned for years to make all vaccines equally available to children throughout the world. Even in the US, high prices appear to limit vaccine utilization. Sales have been sluggish for Dendreon's Provenge despite a positive national coverage decision from Medicare that has prompted insurer cov- erage. Full treatment still costs more than $100,000 due to a complex regimen that in- volves manipulation of a patient's own im- mune cells. Physicians appear reluctant to prescribe Provenge because of tight insurer utilization requirements, high copays, and limited evidence of effectiveness. Price may be a factor in slow vaccination rates for the HPV vaccine as well. A 2010 CDC analysis found that more teens re- ceived vaccines to protect against meningi- tis (63%) and tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (69%), but only 49% of young girls received one dose of the HPV vaccine, and only 32% received the full three-dose regimen. \"Our progress is stagnating,\" complained Anne Schuchat, director of CDC's National Cen- ter for Immunization and Respiratory Dis- eases. \"Now that we have the tools to pre- vent most cervical cancers, it is critical that we use them.\" The CDC report noted lower HPV immunization rates among poor and minority teens, a sign that the $400-price tag for the full course of treatment probably is a problem. Moreover, some parents have raised concerns about side effects linked to Merck's Gardasil, and that some teenagers may regard vaccination as a green light for premarital sex. Merck's efforts to expand Gardasil's label to include male protection from anal cancer also has run into opposition due to cost and effectiveness issues. An analysis for CDC's Advisory Committee for Immu- nization Practices (ACIP) indicates a much MACHINERYPRECISION-CRAFTED Fairfield, New Jersey 07004 mgamerica.com 866-962-3090 973-808-8185FOR A WORLD OF Just because you have multiple needs doesn't mean you need to call on multiple equipment companies.

Although cost issues may limit utilization of some vaccines, adult immunization has gained support from health reform legislation. President Obama's Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover all recommended vaccines for adults, with no copays or deductibles, as part of efforts to expand preventive care. The policy applies now to new group and individual health plans, but is expected to affect all coverage over time. Manufacturing challenges While policymakers wrestle with cost and access issues, manu- facturers still face difficulties ensuring the quality of vaccine production. One reason for low utilization of Merck's Zostavax vaccine for shingles has been supply shortages due to manufac- turing problems at Merck's West Point, Pennsylvania, vaccines plant; reports of charred particles in vials have further compli- cated remedial efforts. Merck's adult vaccines for hepatitis A and hepatitis B also are in short supply, and the company has stopped producing its ProQuad varicella-MMR vaccine. Indian manufacturers seeking to ramp up production of low- cost vaccines also have run into production problems. WHO recently removed combination vaccines produced by Panacea Biotech from its pre-qualification list due to inspections that found quality management deficiencies at the firm's plant near Punjab, India. Meanwhile, FDA has concerns about manufacturing defi- ciencies and particulate contamination at several vaccine com- panies. FDA sent a Warning Letter to Australia-based influenza vaccine maker CSL in June after an March 2011 inspection in- dicated that the company had not addressed manufacturing problems identified at a site visit in April 2010. The initial FDA investigation stemmed from adverse-event reports citing re- ports of fever and convulsions in children taking its influenza vaccine in during the 2009-2010 pandemic, but uncovered a number of deficiencies in recordkeeping and quality control. The challenges of ensuring vaccine safety and quality were il- lustrated in 2010 when FDA suspended the marketing of GSK's rotavirus vaccine, Rotarix, for several months to assess the ef- fect of adventitious porcine virus found in this product. After evaluation, FDA recommended that physicians continue to use Rotarix, as well as Merck's Rota Teq vaccine, which has a similar problem. The agency cited strong safety records for the products and no evidence that the viruses pose a safety risk to humans. The case points to difficulties in adopting advanced analytic technologies that can uncover previously undetectable contami- nants. The challenge for regulators is to weigh the risk of halting vaccination for a dangerous health condition against uncertain effects of apparently benign extraneous viral material. References 1. B.

The second quarter of 2011 ended with $1.24 billion invested through 116 deals, a marked increase of 46% in dollars and 20% in deals from the first quarter. In compar- ing second-quarter performance to the same period of 2010, however, the amount invested on a dollar basis declined 9%, and the number of deals decreased 24%. Comparing the first half of 2011 with the same period of last year shows a decline of approximately $65 million in the amount of venture funding invested. During the third quarter of 2010, ven- ture investment in the US biotechnol- ogy industry declined considerably to $868 million compared with the second quarter 2010 bump of $1.37 billion. The sector raised $3.78 billion in venture- capital funding for all of 2010, slightly beat- ing the $3.72 billion gleaned in 2009 and far underperforming the 2007 and 2008 totals. If investors become disheartened by the slow growth in the US economy, a tightening federal budget and continuing regulatory uncertainly, a similar drop for the third quarter of 2011 may occur. For the second quarter of 2011, the US biotechnology industry remained in second place behind the software industry in its share of total venture- capital funding, the position in which it ended the previous year. The soft- ware industry received $1.5 billion in 254 deals during the second quarter. Two biotechnology subsegments expe- rienced significant upswings in venture funding during the second quarter of 2011: biotechnology research, up 216% year over year and biotechnology equip- ment, which gained 197%. Biotechnol- ogy human captured the largest share of any biotechnology subsegment, with $819 million going into 70 deals, but this level represented a 2% decline in dollars and a 21% decrease in the number of deals from the second quarter of 2010. The average deal size for the biotech- nology sector was $10.7 million in the second quarter of 2011, up 19% com- pared with the same quarter last year and up 22% compared with the first quarter of 2011. Biotechnology cap- tured two of the top 10 venture capital deals for the quarter. Intrexon received $100 million, and Merrimack Pharma- ceuticals drew $77 million. One reason that average deal size is up is that investors realize that the time and capital required to bring a new biotech- nology product to market continues to grow as companies maneuver through a complex regulatory process that re- quires extended clinical trials and a large amount of data to verify safety and ef- ficacy. The lengthy regulatory process also gives investors a reason to gravitate toward later-stage funding of companies closer to achieving liquidity. During the second quarter of 2011, later stage funding increased by 35% year over year to $693 million. Later stage funding also improved when compared with the first quarter of 2011, increasing by 81%. In comparison, early stage funding for the US biotechnology industry declined by 36% from the second quarter of 2010 to $546 million in the second quarter of 2011 . Compared with the first quarter of 2011, however, that figure increased 18%.Those late-stage companies experi- encing exit activity during the quarter helped venture funds achieve liquidity and enabled them to return dollars to their limited partners and increase sup- port for the rest of the companies in their portfolios. Biotechnology companies captured three of the 22 venture-backed initial public offerings (IPOs) during the second quarter of 2011. Internet-specific companies led with 11 IPOs. The biotechnology industry closed seven of 79 mergers and acquisitions for the quarter. The highest dollar deal was Daiichi Sankyo's $805-million ac- quisition of Plexxikon, a biopharma company based in Berkeley, Califor- nia. With Big Pharma facing a loss of $100 billion of revenue between now and 2015 due to patent expirations, we can expect to see more acquisitions of biotechnology companies with prod- ucts in a late stage of development as Big Pharma companies increasingly are looking to external sources of in- novation to replenish their pipelines. Adding to some optimism for the sector, investors who take a longer- term view see high demand for inno- vative biotechnology products that can treat unmet healthcare needs. In the United States, product demand is being fueled by an aging population and an increase in chronic conditions, such as diabetes. In developing nations, there is a potential uptick in demand from gov- ernments seeking to expand the reach of healthcare to more people and to a growing middle class better able to af- ford care. This demand bodes well for the sector, which should continue to at- tract a large share of venture capital as the economy improves. PTTracy T.

Companies such as Merck, Pfizer, and Glaxo-SmithKline (GSK) take the big-picture view of sustainability and consider not only packaging, but also greenhouse-gas emissions, energy consumption, water use, waste, safety, health and wellness, and social and ethical responsibilities. Companies' goals are ambitious; GSK, for example, intends to be carbon- neutral by 2050. Its interim goals in- clude a 10% reduction of carbon emis- sions by 2015 and a 25% reduction by 2025. GSK also has goals for reducing water use and landfilled waste. Merck and GSK rely on solar power to satisfy some of their energy needs. This energy source's positive effect on carbon footprint can be significant; With solar power supplying roughly 10% of the energy needs of two New Jersey facilities, Merck predicts it will reduce its annual carbon-dioxide emis- sions by 2500 tons, which is the equiva- lent of taking 400 cars off the road. Increasingly, drugmakers and other consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies are setting sustainability standards for suppliers to follow. GSK expects 90% of its paper packaging to be derived from sustainable sources by 2020 and has begun to measure sup- plier performance. Demands for sustainable packag- ing come from all directions. It ap- peals to consumers and retailers, such as Walmart. Shareholder advocacy groups like As You Sow are demand- ing that CPG companies shift to green packaging. On the legislative front, interest is growing in adopting an ex- tended producer responsibility (EPR) scheme under which manufacturers assume the expense and oversee the logistics related to packaging disposal. In Europe, where EPR requirements have been in place for many years, the lighter and more renewable the pack- aging material, the lower the costs as- sociated with postconsumer collection, sorting, and recycling. The global market for sustainable pack- aging is worth an estimated $107.7 billion in 2011. Rising demand from all stake- holders is expected to help the market grow steadily through 2021 (1). To increase sustainability, designers incorporate recycled content or renew- able materials and practice source re- duction, a strategy that minimizes or eliminates packaging and almost al- ways cuts material and transportation costs. Recycled content diverts waste from landfills and provides a market for recycled materials. Plant-based re- newable materials reduce reliance on finite resources such as oil. All three tactics lower greenhouse-gas emissions and reduce carbon footprint. Source reduction In a survey of CPG companies and converters, more than half (57%) of respondents said they were working on converting to lightweight packages (2). \"Reducing weight is driven in part by regulations, but also by cost savings,\" says Bernard Rioux, marketing and development manager for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa at DuPont Packaging and Industrial Polymers. A package redesign for Pfizer's Cen- trum multivitamins shows why light- weighting is such a popular tactic. Eliminating the use of polyvinyl chlo- ride (PVC) in the Centrum package and reducing the size of the shipping case saved 60 tons of material during the first year. The smaller shipping cases also allow more product to be shipped per truckload and eliminated the need for 124 trips. At GSK, packaging changes have eliminated tons of material and car- bon-dioxide emissions. For example, a redesigned canister for Ventolin and a transition from corrugated cases to pallet boxes for incoming inhaler components save 305 metric tons of material and reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by 1550 metric tons per year. Elimination of the PVC tray for Nico- derm resulted in a material savings of 8 metric tons and cut carbon-dioxide emissions by 20 metric tons. Many tools support source-reduction efforts. One machine minimizes con- sumption of corrugated cardboard by matching package size to the products being shipped. On-demand conver- sion of fanfolded corrugated sheet into boxes generates substantial savings in Hallie Forcinio is Pharmaceutical technology 's Packaging Forum editor, 4708 morningside Drive, Cleveland, OH 44109, tel. 216.351.5824, fax Outside the Box Hallie Forcinio Drugmakers and packagers are pursuing various initiatives to reduce their carbon footprints.

Renewable feedstocks Recycled content OctOber 2011 PharmTech.comPackaging Forum materials, inventory, and transpor- tation costs by reducing the need to purchase and store many sizes of cor- rugated cases, minimizing cushion- ing requirements, eliminating out-of- stock and obsolete box inventory, and increasing the amount of product per truckload. In addition, operational ef- ficiency improves because the strategy requires less box handling, less inven- tory planning and management, and less communication with vendors. The compact unit occupies 100 ft2 of floor space (Right-sized Packaging on De- mand system, Packsize International). A service optimizes distribution pack- aging by evaluating its size, material content, fill, and ability to prevent dam- age. Packaging that performs acceptably may be marked with a special logo (Eco Responsible Packaging Program, UPS). Suggestions for improvements can be made if a package fails (consulting ser- vices, UPS Package Lab). Software also can be a valuable op- timization tool. Life-cycle assessment software compares packaging choices and evaluates its environmental effects. The tool allows users to import their own life-cycle-inventory and life-cycle impact-assessment data, accepts cus- tom end-of-life recycling rates for in- dividual materials, and models criteria to meet the requirements of Walmart's Packaging Scorecard or the Global Packaging Project (PackageSmart life cycle assessment software, EarthShift). Package design and palletization software, together with cargo-load planning software, size packaging to create the most efficient pallet loads for shipping. Functions include calculat- ing compression or stacking strength to determine the corrugated grade that will protect the product most cost- effectively. The software also optimizes package dimensions to maximize the amount of product shipped per truck or container and creates mixed pal- lets for display. Savings in corrugated cardboard and transportation costs can reach 20% (TOPS Pro and Max- Load Pro software, TOPS Engineering; Cape Pack and Truckfill software from CAPE Systems).Recycled content Levels of recycled content are increas- ing in many packaging formats, par- ticularly for fiber-based packaging, such as corrugated cases, and film and containers made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). In fact, GSK has switched from a PVC clamshell to a recycled PET (rPET) clamshell for Ab- reva. The change cuts carbon-dioxide emissions by 25-52 g/pack. PET films with recycled content fit numerous applications and are com- patible with radio-frequency sealing or heat sealing. Designed to contain a minimum of 35% or 50% postcon- sumer recycled (PCR) content derived from bottles, respectively, the films are suitable for thermoformed packaging, including clamshells, blisters, and trays (Pentaform SmartCycle films, Kl\u00f6ck- ner Pentaplast Group). With rising demand, especially from the beverage industry, the supply of food-grade rPET is growing rapidly. New capacity for food-grade rPET is becoming available in North America, Europe, and Asia. A vertically inte- grated container maker is expanding its recycling facility to produce ultra- clean rPET from PCR material so it can increase rPET levels in its food-grade containers. The expansion will also help the company double its worldwide recycling capability to 10 billion bottles per year by 2016 (Clean Tech recycling facility, Plastipak Packaging). The expansion of a recycling opera- tion in the United Kingdom will more than double production of food-grade rPET in that country and help Coca- Cola Enterprises increase recycled con- tent to 25% in all its PET packaging in Great Britain by 2012 (ECO Plastics).The expansion of another European recycling plant will increase its rPET capacity from 25,000 to 35,000 metric tons and nearly double the number of bottles diverted from landfills each year. The vertically integrated plant in France also produces preforms (Artenius PET Packaging Europe). A plant under construction in Vietnam will recycle 1.5 billion PET bottles per year into food-grade rPET. Although config- ured primarily for bottle-to-bottle applica- tions, the facility also can produce recycled resin for fiber or carpet (Thanh Tai Gas). Renewable materials Although bioplastics, such as polylactic acid and microorganism-generated poly- hydroxyalkanoates (PHA), receive con- siderable attention from package designers and specifiers, much interest in biopoly- mers has shifted to traditional resins such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and PET made from plant-derived feedstocks. These replacements are chemically identi- cal to their petroleum-based counterparts and are recyclable through existing post- consumer collection streams. In fact, bio-based commodity plastics are forecast to overtake biodegradable materials globally, especially for pack- aging applications. \"Our market study shows that biobased commodity plastics, with a total of around 1 million [metric] tons, will make up the majority of pro- duction capacity in 2015,\" reports Hans- Josef Endres, professor of engineering and biotechnology at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Hanover, Germany. Of a total market of 1.7 mil- lion metric tons in 2015, traditional bio- degradable bioplastics will account for 0.7 million metric tons (3). One family of bio-based amorphous PET films contains as much as 30% re- newable content. Derived from ethylene made from sugarcane, the films run on the same tooling as petroleum-based PET and exhibit identical properties (TerraPET films, Kl\u00f6ckner Pentaplast). In other industries, major brands have introduced containers made of biobased HDPE or PET.

Eventually, the company plans to use or- ange peels, potato peels, oat hulls, and other agricultural byproducts from its foods business as the source material. PET bottles with 100% plant-based con- tent require plant-based ingredients such as ethylene glycol and purified terephthalic acid (PTA). Plant-based ethylene glycol has been available for some time and accounts for about 30% of the finished bottle. At least one biobased ethanol plant is operat- ing in Brazil (Braskem). Another is under construction in Santa Vit\u00f3ria, Brazil (joint venture between The Dow Chemical Co. and Mitsui & Co.). Plant-based PTA is just becoming available and typically starts with plant- based para-xylene, a precursor to PTA (sugar-beet-based para-xylene, Virent Energy Systems). Another plant-based para-xylene has been used successfully to make test quantities of PET film and is in the scale-up stage. It's also being studied for use in bottles (plant-based para-xylene, Gevo). PET 30% renew- able content based on sugarcane. Coca- Cola predicts that sales of products in PlantBottle containers will exceed 5 billion in 2011\u2014about twice the num- ber sold in 2010. Market reach has also grown from nine countries in 2010 to 15 in 2011. Coca-Cola also has developed an HDPE PlantBottle based on ethanol derived from sugarcane. It is used for single-serving containers for Odwalla juice products. Other brand owners using sugarcane- based HDPE containers include Danone Canada and Procter & Gamble (P&G). Danone Canada estimates that its con- version to sugarcane-based HDPE con- tainers for DanActive, Danacol, Danino Go, and Activia drinkable yogurt will reduce its carbon footprint by 55%. \"The packaging for Danone products accounts for 40% of our company's ecological foot- print, and is the second most important factor in terms of emissions,\" notes Anne- Julie Maltais, manager of external com- munications for Danone Canada. At P&G, switching to sugarcane-based HDPE bottles for Pantene Pro-V Nature Fusion hair-care products will help meet sustainability goals. The global rollout begins in western Europe and should be completed by 2013. By 2020, the company plans to replace 25% of petroleum-based materials with sustainably sourced, renew- able materials. Eventually, P&G intends to use only renewable or recycled materials for its products and packaging. References 1.

To alleviate confusion about being out-of-control (OOC), this column proposes concepts and defini- tions for the industry. No plant manager wants to hear the words, \"Your process is out-of-control.\" The process was probably designed, developed, nursed, nurtured, fine- tuned, tested, and coddled until it met the definition of a validated process (1). Now, someone who was never involved in process development declares it is as OOC. Not a welcome message and it begs the question, \"out-of-control for what?\" Modifiers and definitions are needed. There are several ways that the pro- cess can be described as OOC. There could be equipment failures or changes in the raw materials used. The process could be financially OOC (i.e., losing money), or out-of-regulatory-control with cGMP violations. Perhaps the op- erators are creating excessive deviations and confusion by not following the stan- dard operating procedures because of a dysfunctional work culture; managerial malfeasance has resulted in the demise of several companies in the past. If we say it is OOC, we are obligated to specify how. The most notorious lack of control is being out-of-specification (OOS, 2). An OOS situation exists when a reportable result collected at a single point in time exceeds a predetermined specification (3). This event precipitates a cascade of activity as described in the OOS guid- ance. This has been discussed exten- sively for years and is well understood by the industry. out-of-trend A more recent concern is being out-of- trend (OOT). An OOT situation exists when one or more reportable results, collected over a period of time, are compared with a historical data set or with a statistical model and deter- mined to be different from a practical significance standpoint. The cause behind OOT occurrences can take several forms. The process could experience a sudden change in the average or have an outlying data point. The standard deviation of the data could increase or decrease. The general direction of the data could be gradually upward or downward, which is often called process drift. Finally, the process could cycle up and down. Cycling can occur if the operators over control for the criti- cal process parameters (also known as independent variables or factors) and actually induce additional vari- ability into the critical quality attri-butes (also known as dependent vari- ables or responses). Note that OOT is usually perceived as a negative event but it could be a positive one. If the variability decreases or if the average moves towards the target, that would be a beneficial trend. If stability data does not change over the course of the study, that would be a neutral trend. These changes need not reach the level of statistical significance to raise an alert and initiate a response. This concept is supported by the re- cent Supreme Court case for Matrixx (4, see page 118 for the full report). The court held that a change or difference does not have to be statistically signifi- cant to warrant a preliminary examina- tion of the data or even an investigation. Thus, OOT is seen as a practical signifi- cance issue and not a statistical one. The comparison of practical signifi- cance and statistical significance was discussed in the March 2010 Statistical Solutions column on the role of statisti- cal significance tests (5). The goal of a statistical significance test is to prevent us from deciding something is important when it is just due to chance. In fact, if a difference or change is not of any prac- tical importance or significance, being statistically significant is frankly not of much interest. Western Electric 8 The application of statistical concepts to manufacturing in the United States is often traced to 1924 when Dr. Walter Shewhart wrote his famous memo de- scribing for the first time the statistical control chart (or Shewhart chart) while he was working at Western Electric in Cicero, Illinois.Current GMPs demand full understanding of out-of-control concepts.Lynn D. TorbeckooS, oot, ooc, and ooSc Lynn D. is a statistician at Torbeck and Evanston, IL 60202, tel. 847.424.1314, Lynn@Torbeck.org, www.torbeck.org.If a difference or change is not of any practical importance or significance, being statistically significant is frankly not of much interest.Pharmaceutical Technology OctOber 2011 47Statistical Solutions At that time, the term \"control\" was innocuous enough and didn't raise questions when he and others spoke of control limits and of being OOC. In the context of statistical control charts, if the pattern of values exceeds one or more the Western Electric 8 (WE8) rules, the data set is said to be \"out-of-control\" (6). (Note that most companies only use one or two, and no more than three, of the eight rules to avoid over-control.) But we need an additional modifier here as well. It is clearer to say the data set or process is \"out-of-statistical-control\" (OOSC). This has been the case since 1924, and there is no reason to change such an old habit now. If someone speaks of being out-of-control in the context of a statistical control chart we assume it is out-of-statistical-control. It should be pointed out that it is possible to be out-of-statistical-control and still al- ways meet the specifications. Not all processes, for example bio- technology, will easily exist in a con- sistent state of statistical control. Such a situation is often called being in a \"state of engineering control.\" In the chemical and refining industries, en- gineering control is more narrowly defined as the application of propor- tional, integral, or derivative tuners for process control. cGMP perspective That said, the cGMPs still call for companies to have firm control of their processes, statistical or other- wise. Being out-of-statistical-control, but within specifications is not accept- able from a cGMP perspective because there is a higher probability of manu- facturing defective product. Compa- nies are required to show continuing due diligence, provide data and analy- sis to prove that the process is being brought into a state of statistical con- trol, or provide a scientific and statisti- cal study to explain why it cannot be controlled. To summarize, for control charts, practical significance and OOT go together, and statistical significance and statistical control go together. There are four possible combinations, the control charts for which can be viewed together at PharmTech.com/ controlcharts: 1. Not OOT and not OOSC: the ideal situation 2. Not OOT but OOSC: cannot yet see a practical change, but failed one or more WE8 rules (see Figure 1) 3. OOT but not OOSC: can see a prac- tical change that is not yet statistically significant (see Figure 2) 4. OOT and OOSC: can see a practical change that is statistically significant. Finally, any of these four combinations can be OOS or not OOS as the specifi-cation concept is independent of trend (practical significance) and statistical significance. References 1.

But oral administration remains an elusive goal in biopharmaceutical drug delivery. To date, major obstacles have included problems of bioavailability caused by low absorption, poor cellular permeability, and protein instability and degradation. Several specialty pharmaceutical and other companies are applying various absorption-enhancing technologies to address the problem with some suc- cess. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including limitations on the size of the macromolecules that can be delivered. The challenges Formulation concerns. Achieving suf- ficient absorption of proteins is the most crucial challenge in formulation development, according to Wei-Guo Dai, a research fellow in drug delivery and device development at Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical R&D. Deliv- ering an adequate amount of protein into circulation by oral delivery is dif- ficult because enzymes in the body de- grade the protein, the gastrointestinal membrane is poorly permeable, and large molecules cannot easily enter into the bloodstream intact. Past efforts involving particulate delivery systems (e.g., nanoparticles or liposomes, mul- tifunctional polymers, and enzyme inhibitors) have achieved low rates of absorption that were not adequate to achieve therapeutic efficacy, says Dai. Permeation enhancers are one strat- egy to improve oral absorption. These agents include surfactants, fatty acids, and bile salts. They can be added to the formulation as excipients, or incorpo-rated into the delivery systems using proprietary technologies. Permeation enhancers function by disrupting the intestine's epithelial membrane or by loosening the tight junctions (i.e., intra- cellular barriers) between epithelial cells. In certain cases, permeation en- hancers have enabled formulators to achieve 10% bioavailability in preclini- cal research studies. But the amount of permeation enhancers required in these studies raises concerns about toxicity. Various types of permeation enhanc- ers entail various levels of risk, but even agents that are generally recognized as safe, such as ethanol and fatty acids, could pose toxicity problems because of the dosage amount and frequency. Formulators thus must conduct com- prehensive toxicity studies, says Dai. Another strategy to compensate for low bioavailability is to increase the dose of protein in a tablet. For ex- ample, if a tablet contained hundreds of milligrams of insulin\u2014far more than is administered in an injection\u2014 and if 1-5% of it were absorbed into the bloodstream, it could be enough to achieve the desired therapeutic ef- fect. But this approach has limitations. \"You may be able to jack up the dose, but your absorption window may be so small that you just don't have enough time for the drug to be absorbed,\" says Carlos N. Velez, managing partner of LacertaBio, a biotechnology business- development consulting firm. Aside from absorption issues, in- creasing the level of protein in an oral formulation may not be cost-effective in the absence of a superior clinical ben- efit. \"My guess is there just aren't enough suppliers for some of these proteins to bring the cost down to the point where you've got a $5-per-day dose,\" says Velez. He cites one company that has an oral formulation of a modestly sized peptide, but cannot buy the active ingredient at a low price. \"It'll be an enormous dollar- per-day dose, and that program is prob- ably not going to get very far because of a supply-cost issue,\" says Velez. Manufacturing obstacles.

One major problem is that proteins must be incorporated into a matrix, typically a disaccharide. Most tablet- production facilities run at a controlled humidity of 40%, but because the disaccharide matrix is extremely hy- groscopic, the formulation becomes a paste under those conditions, \"and it's a mess,\" says Pikal. Operating a plant at 2% humidity would avoid this problem, but this solution could be impractical because the technology would be ex- tremely expensive for a tablet manufac- turing facility. Another strategy might be to enclose much of the production line with bar- rier technology to keep oxygen and moisture out until the tablets are pack- aged. \"Using the best of the techniques that are available, you can probably do that, but it's a significant engineering challenge,\" says Pikal. \"While barrier systems are becoming common in par- enteral operations, as far as I know, such systems are not available for tablet op- erations,\" he adds. It's also conceivable that a manufacturer would have to make major changes to the air-handling and humidity-control systems for its plant.In addition, amorphous disaccharide matrices that contain proteins are not particularly compressible, so formula- tors would have to add ingredients (e.g., diluents or disintegrants) to achieve a mixture that could be made into a tab- let more readily. Also, it seems unlikely that a protein formulation could be wet granulated, so processing methodol- ogy would be limited, says Pikal. The amount of excipients required likely would limit the amount of protein that the tablet could contain. As a result, the amount of protein in the tablet \"is going to have to be awfully small,\" ac- cording to Pikal, and manufacturers might be limited to working only with potent proteins for their tablet. Besides causing problems for the manufacturing process, moisture also can degrade the protein itself. \"In some cases, you can break just one of those amino acid or disulfide bonds, and the activity of the molecule is destroyed,\" says Velez. A traditional wet granulator and tablet punch may not be peptide- friendly, he adds. A tableting method would need to ensure protein stability and activity throughout the process. This tableting process would have to include analytical methods to moni- tor the protein's structure. Personnel possibly could extract sample tablets during the process, for example, then extract the protein and analyze it with X-ray crystallography.Oral absorption- enhancing technologies Oral absorption-enhancing technolo- gies are one way to address the problem of poor bioavailability encountered in biopharmaceutical drug delivery. Several specialty pharmaceutical companies have developed such technology platforms. Passive transcellular transport through small-molecule carriers. One approach taken by the biopharmaceutical company Emi- sphere Technologies uses small-molecule carriers to enable the passive transcellular transport of drug molecules across cell membranes. The company has devel- oped a library of about 4000 proprietary small-molecule compounds, including acylated amino acids. The compounds' molecular weights typically are less than 400 Da and are the basis of Emisphere's Eligen Technology. The company uses a screening pro- cess to match the properties of its carri- ers (e.g., solubility) to those of the drug to be formulated. The goal is to find carriers that will help protect the drug and interact with it in the right way to deliver it into circulation. The carriers and the protein are blended together in a conventional process, but manufacturers must con- trol parameters such as heat to ensure that the protein is not damaged. \"It's really, in most cases, blending the carriers and proceeding with the pro- cess as you would with any other oral drug,\" says Prateek Bhargava, Emi- sphere's manager of formulations. The carriers can be used in most processes (e.g., milling, blending, and compres- sion) and require no special handling. After blending, the carrier and protein engage in a weak, noncova- lent interaction that does not alter the protein's form. The process is similar to that of physically mixing a small- molecule active ingredient and excipi- ent. This interaction protects the pro- tein from rapid degradation as it enters the acidic environment of the stomach and confronts enzymes in the small intestine. The carriers transport the therapeutic molecule through the gas- trointestinal tract quickly, which also reduces the opportunity for protein Unigene's tablet formulations use an enteric coat, protease inhibitors, and absorption enhancers to deliver peptides and proteins orally. image is courtesy of unigene laboratories50% of Out-of-Speci cation (OOS) results in QA/QC are caused by manual sample processing steps or human error.

Unlike other carrier-based drug- delivery typically use per- meation enhancers, Eligen Tech- nology conveys its payload through passive transcellular transport. The carriers cause a transient fluidization of the membranes in the gastrointesti- nal tract, thus increasing their permea- bility. After the membrane absorbs the formulation, it closes again. \"Typically, we start to see absorption in the stom- ach. It can also continue into the upper intestine, all the way through the small intestine, but we typically see a rapid uptake of the drug, says Gschneidner. After the formulation enters the bloodstream, it is greatly diluted. The large volume of blood is enough to break the weak noncovalent bond be- tween the carrier and the protein, thus causing the two to separate in a pas- sive process. The carrier is eliminated through normal excretory processes. The largest molecule that the Eligen Technology has delivered is human growth hormone, which has a mo- lecular weight of about 22 kDa. The carriers also have been able to deliver heparin, which has a molecular weight of 12-15 kDa, and insulin, which has a molecular weight of almost 6 kDa. Emisphere has not yet marketed an oral formulation of a large molecule, but has one product, salmon calcito- nin, a 32-amino-acid linear polypep- tide hormone, in Phase III clinical trials. The drug, a treatment for os- teoporosis and osteoarthritis, is being developed jointly with Novartis. In ad- dition, Emisphere is collaborating with Novo Nordisk on the oral delivery of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and insulin analogs. The GLP-1 analogs are in Phase I trials, and the oral insulin is in preclinical development. Enterically coated tablets. To deliver biopharmaceuticals orally, Unigene Laboratories creates enterically coated tablets that include permeation en- hancers and protease inhibitors, which prevent protein degradation. The pro- tease inhibitor is citric acid, an organic acid that, when released from the tab- let, creates a transient, localized, acidic microenvironment in which enzymes cannot readily break down the The permeation enhancer is an acyl carnitine, L-lauroyl affecting calcium transport and levels of adenosine triphosphate within the epithelial cells of the intestine, the acyl carnitine tempo- rarily loosens the tight junctions between these cells. This action frees the peptide to pass through these junctions by a mecha- nism called paracellular transport. The tablet formulation is protected by a pH-sensitive, poly(meth)acrylate based enteric coat that remains stable in the acidic environment of the stom- ach. The coating, made from Evonik's Eudragit polymers, keeps the tablet intact and prevents the peptide from being absorbed in the stomach. When the tablet enters the duodenum, which is a neutral environment, the enteric coating dissolves.

Altering the thickness of the enteric coating affects the timing of drug re- lease and can help obtain the best bioa- vialability and consistency. A water-soluble subcoat ensures that the enteric coating dissolves completely before the tablet releases its acid (i.e., the protease inhibitor) into the intes- tine. Otherwise, the release of the acid could prevent the rapid and complete dissolution of the enteric coat. The sub- coat thus ensures that the formulation \"is much more consistent in its release characteristics than it would have oth- erwise been,\" says Nozer Mehta, Unige- ne's vice-president of biological R&D. Paracellular transport raises the risk that unwanted materials, such as other small, digested food-based peptides, may pass through the tight junctions after they have been opened. This risk is mitigated because the enteric coating is designed to remain intact until the tablet opens in a small area in the duodenum. The coating thus prevents acyl carnitine from opening tight junctions through- out the gastrointestinal tract. Unigene's studies also show that the tight-junction opening is a transient phenomenon (1). \"If you gave the permeation enhancer 30 minutes in advance and then gave the peptide, you would not see any absorp- tion, says Mehta. Paracellular transport does limit the size of the molecules that can be de- livered. Unigene has delivered insulin successfully, and it generally focuses on molecules made of fewer than 50-60 amino acids. \"Large proteins probably would not work with our technology,\" says Mehta. Peptides do not have to be deriva- tized or changed to be compatible with Unigene's oral technology. In addition, the method requires no special manu- facturing equipment other than spray coaters to apply the subcoat and the enteric coat to the tablet. Unigene and Tarsa Therapeutics recently completed a Phase III study of a calcitonin formulation made with Unigene's oral delivery technology. Unigene also is using the technology to develop a parathyroid hormone analog, currently in Phase II development, with GlaxoSmithKline. Other commercial approaches Various other companies have devel- oped their own approaches to deliv- ering large molecules orally. Merrion Pharmaceuticals's GIPET technology platform small- and large-mol- ecule surface-active materials to en- hance drug absorption in the small in- testine. The surface-active agents used in GIPET are generally regarded as safe (GRAS) materials, including fatty acids and derivatives, surfactants (e.g., mono- or diglycerides), and and liquid crys- tals that entrap the active compound through physical or physical-chemical interactions, according to the company. Mixing the enhancer and drug some- times increases the latter's lipophilic properties, thus enabling large cules to cross the gastrointestinal mem- brane. The micelles and liquid crystals also protect drug molecules from enzy- matic degradation. By acting as mild surfactants, GIPET enhancers increase the fluidity of the apical membrane and aid the transcel- lular transport of drug molecules. The agents also can increase the paracellu- lar transport of drugs by contracting cytoskeletal actin filaments, which open the tight junctions and permit increased permeation of hydrophilic compounds. This function is not con- sidered a significant component of the activity of GIPET, however. The technology can be used to create three types of dosage forms. GIPET I yields enteric-coated tablets that con-tain the surface-active materials in powder form, along with the drug. GIPET II creates microemulsions of oil, surfactant, and drug in an enteric- coated gel capsule. GIPET III produces a mixture of fatty-acid derivatives in an enteric-coated gel capsule. All three GIPETs can deliver peptide or protein drugs. GIPET dosage forms can be cre- ated using conventional solid oral dos- age manufacturing equipment. In Phase I clinical studies, GIPET successfully delivered acyline, a deca- peptide that can be used to treat prostate and breast cancer, by the oral route and achieved pharmacological activity. GIPET also delivered a peptide of a similar size, desmopressin, in the clinic. Merrion cur- rently is collaborating with a partner to deliver larger peptides with GIPET. No products created through this technology have been marketed, however (2). Intravail technology from Aegis Therapeutics uses transmucosal ab- sorption enhancers for the oral deliv- ery of potent peptides and proteins. The Intravail absorption enhancers comprise a group of alkylsaccharides related to mild surfactants common in personal care and food products. The GRAS enhancers do not irritate muco- sal membranes. Studies conducted at Albany Medi- cal College have shown that the Intra- vail excipients can promote the oral absorption of certain peptides, such as octreotide and the antiobesity-an- tidiabetic leptin fragment D-Leu-OB3. The technology provides bioavailabil- ity comparable to or exceeding that achieved by subcutaneous injection. In one study, Intravail increased the oral absorption of an antibreast-cancer pep- tide by a factor of 10 and reduced the projected daily oral human dose from 2 mg/day to 200 \u00b5g/day. In addition to increasing bioavailability, the Intravail excipients have been shown to prevent peptide and protein aggregation and reduce resulting immunogenicity. The Intravail technology delivers pro- tein therapeutics as large as 30,000 Da, including GLP-1 analogs, calcitonin, growth hormone, leptin, insulin, eryth- ropoietin, and low molecular weight Merrion uses surface-active materials to enhance drug absorption in the small intestine.Patented Core Feeder Technology The first and second layer can be different products Allows a core tablet or component to be inserted into a predetermined location in a specific die utilizing a continuous chain Applies advanced technology for core-coating and time-release solid dosage tablets and core-component placement Cores are held in position and slowly embedded into the tablet over 32-degrees of turntable rotation allowing consistent, accurate and repeatable placement from setup to setup The placement positioning within the die is maintained by the geometry of the transfer cogElizabeth Hata's Core-Tableting System increases Hata's Triple Layer Press capabilities by efficiently producing single-layer, bi-layer, tri-layer and core-coated tablets.

Intravail formulations are compatible with conventional manu- facturing processes for flash-dissolve wafers, tablets, and gelcaps. In August 2011, Aegis received a patent for its Intravail-based oral for- mulations of several GLP-1 analogs. In April 2011, Aegis and scientists at Albany Medical College found that an Intravail-based oral formulation of the peptide octreotide achieved sys- temic bioavailability that exceeded that achieved by subcutaneous injection. The NanoCrystal technology from Alkermes (formerly Elan Drug Tech- nologies) is designed to increase drugs' solubility and can be used to deliver proteins and peptides (3). First, nanosized drug particles are created through methods such as wet milling, homogenization, precipitation, and supercritical-fluid techniques. This step increases the drug's surface area and enhances its dissolution profile. Proprietary stabilizers, such as F68 and sodium deoxycholate, are then surface adsorbed onto the drug par- ticles to prevent agglomeration. This process yields an aqueous dispersion that behaves like a solution and can be sprayed onto a substrate, such as lac- tose, and compressed into a tablet (4). Scientists have used the NanoCrystal technology to deliver zinc insulin orally. By altering peptides' particle size and surface properties, NanoCrystal tech- nology can improve bioavailability by as much as 600%, according to the com- pany. The technology also enabled si- rolimus, an injectable cancer compound sold by Pfizer, to be formulated as an oral tablet. The technology can boost the drug's rate of absorption and reduce the size of the required dose. Researchers' solutions Researchers at universities also are looking for methods of delivering pep- tides and proteins orally. A research team at Kyoto Pharmaceutical Univer- sity created a gastrointestinal mucoad- hesive patch system (GI-MAPS) con- sisting of four layered films contained within an enteric capsule. The system's backing layer is made of ethyl cellulose (EC), a water-insoluble polymer. Its surface layer is made of an enteric pH- sensitive polymer (e.g., hydroxypro- pylmethylcellulose phthalate) coated with an adhesive layer. The middle layer, made of cellulose membrane, contains the drug and permeation en- hancers (e.g., organic acids and surfac- tants), and is attached to the backing layer by a heating-press method. The surface layer is attached to the middle layer with an adhesive layer made of carboxyvinyl polymer. After oral administration, the system's surface layer dissolves and adheres to the mucosal membrane of the small intes- tine. This result creates a closed space that contains the drug and the absorp- tion enhancer. The high-concentration gradient in the closed space causes the small intestine to absorb the protein through passive diffusion. The GI-MAPS enabled the research- ers to deliver recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor orally to dogs and obtain bioavailability of 23%. By collabotaing with the semi- conductor industry, drug-delivery com- pany BioSerenTach developd a machine that produces GI-MAPS under GMP conditions (5, 6). Particulate systems, including solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), have been investigated as carriers for peptides, proteins, and antigens. Scientists have incorporated proteins and antigens into SLN and administered them orally. SLN formulations have improved protein stability, protected proteins from deg- radation, and achieved sustained drug release. Cyclosporine A, insulin, calci- tonin, and somatostatin have been in- corporated into solid lipid particles and are currently being studied (7). Researchers at St. John's University in Queens, New York, formulated oral dosage forms of -lactamase (BLM) within self-nanoemulsifying drug-de- livery systems (SNEDDS). gly- col monolaurate, polyethoxylated cas- tor oil, and 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethanol. They loaded approximately 2200 mU of BLM into the oil phase of SNEDDS using a solid-dispersion technique (8, 9). In vitro tests of transporting BLM across a cell monolayer showed that the SNEDDS resulted in 33% cumula- tive transport of BLM at 5 h while the BLM free solution achieved negligible transport. Oral delivery of 4500 mU/kg of BLM in a SNEDDS to rats achieved a bioavailability of 6.34%, which was 1.5 times greater than that achieved by BLM free solution. Delivery of BLM in the aqueous phase of the nanoemulsion resulted in a pharmacokinetic profile similar to that obtained by the free so- lution (10). The scientists currently are continuing these studies. Conclusion Scientists have made progress in develop- ing tablet formulations that can protect proteins from the digestive system and deliver them into the bloodstream. The level of bioavailability that current for- mulations achieve may not be adequate for clinical or commercial purposes, however. Even if these problems were to be solved, manufacturers would still need to develop new manufacturing and analytical methods that safeguarded pro- teins' stability and ensured their biologi- cal activity.

IMAGE: INFLUX PRODUCTIONS, PHOTODISK, GETTY IMAGESThe surge in the number of biologics in the drug-development pipeline, over 900 according to the latest report from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, introduces pressure on manufacturers to handle in- creasing numbers of small-volume prod- ucts (1). In fill-finish operations, this means manufacturers must have the abil- ity to quickly and efficiently switch their fill line from product to product without compromising product quality or sterility. Manufacturers are beginning to take ad- vantage of the benefits afforded by single- use technologies to address these needs. Single-use technologies are now widely- accepted tools in drug manufacturing, particularly manufacturing of biologics. A recent biomanufacturing survey in Phar- maceutical Technology indicated that 66% of respondents use at least some disposable components in their manufacturing opera- tions, and an additional 9% of respondents indicated that they use all disposables (2). Disposable upstream-processing tools, such as bioreactors and media storage containers have made a natural transition from bench-top to large-scale cell culture, and have evolved in size and complexity to fit the special needs of manufacturing- scale operations. Disposable downstream- processing tools have also been adapted to meet the demands of large-scale biopro- cessing. At the very end of the biomanu- facturing line is the fill-finish operation, where single-use technologies are just beginning to make inroads. Fill-finish is the last step in the manufacturing operation, after which the product is passed to the patient. As such, product quality and the possibility of contamination are of special concern when a manufacturer is considering whether to implement single-use tech- nologies. The fill occurs downstream of the last filtration step, so there is a height- ened sensitivity to sterility risks and the introduction of particulates. As with all disposable applications, product/material interactions and extractables and leach- ables are also concerns. In some cases, manufacturers may be reluctant to switch to a disposable line from a well-validated stainless-steel fill At the End of the Line: Single-Use Technologies in Fill-Finish Operations Amy RitterSINGLE-USE TECHNOLOGY Single-use, reusable or hybrid.

Kent Payne, vice-president and general manager of Development Services at Catalent Pharma Solutions indicated that in general, a big obstacle to adopting single-use technolo- gies in other parts of the manufacturing process has been a reluctance to change. \"The biggest challenge we faced in suc- cessfully applying single use systems elsewhere was first changing mindset to be open to new approaches from what we were used to,\" he says. For single-use sys- tems, validation of sterility and integrity is done by the supplier of the components, rather than the manufacturer. Handing these important quality checks over to another party requires a leap of faith that some may not be comfortable making. On the other hand, single-use tech- nologies offer advantages over stainless systems in control of contamination. In the PharmTech survey, a majority of respondents listed reduced risk of con- tamination as an advantage to single-use systems (2). A single-use filling line can be configured to have fewer connection points than a fixed-pipe line, thus reduc- ing the risk of microbial contamination. Moreover, since the line is only used for a single product, there is no risk of carry- over contamination. Althea Technologies uses disposable technologies in all of its fill operations. According to Chris Duffy, vice-president of operations, \"Preventing cross-contamination is an issue that Al- thea takes very seriously. To ensure that there is no carryover from project to proj- ect, Althea has stringent changeover pro- cedures and operates its fill facility with disposable technology in virtually 100% of our fill operations, from small-scale Phase I clinical supplies to commercial manufacturing.\" Time savings and flexibility Perhaps the biggest benefit to be gained by implementing a single-use filling line is the savings in time gained by eliminat- ing the cleaning and validation steps. Na- than Beyeler, process engineer at Merck Sharp and Dohme, cited the decrease in changeover time as being an important factor in the decision to implement a single-use fill line. \"Market pressure and good business sense dictate that we need to use our filling assets for manufacturing product, not for getting ready to manu- facture product,\" he says. \"The need to get the most product out of the process is increasingly critical to the business. That said, the paradigm of a few blockbuster vaccines allowing for long campaign operation and few product-to-product changeovers is under pressure as products portfolios become more focused on multi- ple (lower annual volume) biologics. This means that a production facility is faced with the challenge of more frequently changing the facility and equipment over to process different products. The reduc- tion of changeover time has therefore be- come one of the primary influences in our decision to implement single-use technol- ogy for current filling facilities.\" Indeed, Beyeler reported a reduction in changeover time from 16 hours to two hours when switching to a single- use line. In addition, a recent report produced by authors from Millipore demonstrated a similar reduction in total processing time, from 19 hours to 1.5 hours, when switching from a stain- less system to a single-use system (3). On average, biotech companies out- source 81% of their fill-and-finish require- ments. Biotech and pharmaceutical com- panies with in-house capabilities outsource 40% of their requirements (4). This means that CMOs are handling a large variety of filling operations, and can benefit from the flexibility afforded by single-use systems to handle multiple products. Althea's Duffy notes, \"Stainless equipment requirements vary from client to client. When not in use, these must be stored and when they are placed back into service must be cleaned again.\" The ability to quickly reconfigure the line to accommodate different size runs, different biosafety requirements, or different product containers adds greater flexibility to the filling operation. Evolving equipment requirements It is often the case that equipment evolves to fill an unmet need, and this is the case with disposables for fill-finish. At its simplest, a filling line can consist of a product container bag, a pump and a fill- ing needle, all connected by plastic tub- ing. Disposable filling lines, suitable for smaller-scale fills are available as \"plug- and-play\" systems, where the line comes fully assembled and presterilized, ready to be used. Such systems are adequate for small-scale fills, but do not operate at high speed and may not be suitable for high-viscosity products. Pump technology has improved to the point where disposable filling lines are feasible, but further improvements are possible. Peristaltic pumps have only re- cently achieved the accuracy required for fill applications. They are still limited by speed, and the tubing that runs through the pump is subject to degradation and de- formation over time. Plastic, disposable, rolling-diaphragm pumps are currently available and offer an alternative. How- ever, more rigorous applications requiring high volume, high speed, or high pressure, may be places where stainless steel contin- ues to be the better choice. There is plenty of room for new tech- nology to adapt to these challenges. Beye- ler says, \"At the moment, I think what has been offered is that which is the easiest and least risky to develop from the equip- ment vendors, a single-use version of what is already on the market. Some equipment suppliers for upstream processing have innovated beyond the 'also in single-use' type of approach and have developed specifically new technologies. As vendors increasingly see the potential competi- tive advantages for single-use technolo- gies I am looking for them to specifically invest R&D in developing innovative fill- ing technologies.\" The requirements for speed and cost-effectiveness in multiprod- uct manufacturing will drive the develop- ment of new disposable technologies for fill-finish operations.

Despite this essential role in drug develop- ment and commercialization, as with other suppliers to the pharmaceutical industry, such as producers of raw ma- terials, intermediates, or APIs, excipient manufacturers have to respond to the changing fundamentals influencing pharmaceutical supply and demand. In reviewing the recent activity of ex- cipient manufacturers, several trends emerge: increased consolidation based on product-line enhancement or geo- graphic expansion, select investment in emerging markets, and targeted growth in select product areas. Crunching the numbers The global excipients market is ex- pected to grow at a moderate pace through 2016 in line with overall phar- maceutical industry growth. The global pharmaceutical market is expected to reach $1 trillion by 2014 and nearly $1.1 trillion by 2015, according to the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics. The market is projected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3-6% during the next five years, slow- ing from the 6.2% annual growth rate that occurred during the past five years. For purposes of this analysis, the phar- maceutical market includes all types of biopharmaceuticals, including biologics, over-the-counter drugs, and traditional medicines distributed and administered through regulated delivery systems, such as pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, physi- cian offices, and mail order. Spending figures are reported as ex-manufacturer estimates that do not reflect off-invoice discounts and rebates (1). The global excipients market was val- ued at $4.6 billion in 2010 and is expected to reach $4.9 billion in 2011, according to IMAGE: NICHOLAS EVELEIGH / GETTY IMAGESThe global excipients market shows moderate growth, increased consolidation, and expansion activity in emerging markets and select product areas.

The global excipients mar- ket is expected to increase to $6.7 billion by 2016, representing a five-year CAGR of 6.5%. In terms of volume, 11.1 billion pounds of excipients are projected to be consumed in 2011. This level is expected to increase to 14 billion pounds by 2016, representing a CAGR in volume of 4.6%. BCC cites several factors influencing the global excipients market: concerns in the global pharmaceutical supply chain, ap- plication of quality by design in drug for- mulation and manufacturing, and overall concern for drug safety. BCC segments the market for ex- cipients into three major areas: organic excipients, inorganic excipients, and US Pharmacopeia (USP) water. Organic excipients represent the bulk of the global excipients market, accounting for approx- imately 93% by value in 2010. The market for organic excipients was valued at $4.3 billion 2010. It is expected to reach $4.5 billion in 2011 and $6.3 billion in 2016, representing a five-year CAGR of 6.6%. The market for inorganic excipients was $248 million in 2010. It is expected to reach $268 million in 2011 and $350 million by 2016, representing a five-year CAGR of 5.5%, according to BCC. USP water is the smallest segment in the global excipients market. In 2010, the market for USP water accounted for only $88 million. It is projected to increase to $92 million in 2011 and to $114 million by 2016, representing a five-year CAGR of 4.4%. Company deals and expansions Like the pharmaceutical industry as a whole and within specific sectors of the pharmaceutical ingredient supply chain, the excipient market has seen a fair amount of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in 2010 and 2011. In some in- stances, this M&A activity has been part of larger acquisitions among specialty- chemical and fine-chemical companies and other buyers. The deals also have in- cluded targeted product-line acquisitions as well as specific acquisitions by Western excipient manufacturers to increase their manufacturing, technical-service capa- bilities, and product offerings in emerg- ing markets.

Along with this deal- making, some excipient manufacturers also are expanding production capacity for select products. Lubrizol. One of the largest and most recent deals occurred in September 2011, when the conglomerate Berkshire Hatha- way completed its $9.7-billion acquisition of the specialty-chemical Lubrizol, which included excipients business. business in- cludes excipients used in solid, semisolid, and liquid dosage forms for oral and topical formulations. For oral solid dosage forms, key products are Carbopol polymers and Noveon polycarbophil, high molecular- weight polymers crosslinked with polyalkenyl alcohols or divinyl glycol. These poly- mers are used several commercial tablet forms, including swallowable (peroral), chewable, buccal, and sublingual tablets (2). With the closing of the deal, Lubrizol became a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, and Lubrizol's in- ternational headquarters will remain in Wickliffe, Ohio, according to a Sept. 16, 2011, Berkshire Hathaway press release. Berkshire Hathaway's acquisition of Lubrizol follows recent investment by Lu- brizol in India and the United States. In November 2010, Lubrizol opened a new regional applications and business center in Mumbai to support its advanced ma- terials business segment, which includes pharmaceutical ingredients and other consumer and industrial products. The center includes a development and ap- plications laboratory, which includes development, formulation, and appli- cations-testing capabilities in multiple personal-care and coatings applications as well as a pharmaceutical application development center. In May 2010, Lubrizol Advanced Ma- terials, a business segment of Lubrizol, announced an investment of approxi- mately $40 million in its Calvert City, Kentucky, manufacturing facility. The facility specializes in the production of Carbopol polymers, which are used in pharmaceuticals and personal care and home care products. Ashland. Another recent large deal was the $3.2-billion acquisition of In- ternational Specialty Products (ISP) by the specialty-chemical company Ash- land. The deal was completed in late August 2011. ISP is being integrated into Ashland Aqualon Functional In- gredients commercial unit, which was renamed as Ashland Specialty Ingre- dients following the acquisition. The deal combines the companies' prod- uct portfolio in water-soluble polymers and functional ingredients, inclusive of pharmaceutical excipients. Ashland Aqualon Functional Ingredi- ents offers functional excipients for solid, semisolid, and liquid dosage forms with the Ashland Aqualon Functional Ingredients business follow- ing its 2008 acquisition of the US-based specialty-chemical company Hercules. With the acquisition of ISP, Ashland gained additional excipients (e.g., cro- spovidone used as tablet disintegrants as well as povidone and copovidone used as binders). Ashland also acquired process technology for drug solubilization (e.g., spray drying and hot-melt extrusion) and related ingredient supply for drug solubi- lization (e.g., cyclodextrins and polymers for solid dispersions) as well as coating technology for immediate and delayed- release formulations. BASF. In December 2010, BASF com- pleted its acquisition of Cognis, a spe- cialty chemical company to the food, home care, personal care, and phar- maceutical industries, including ex- cipients. The equity purchase price was \u20ac700 million ($958 million). Including net financial debt and pension obligations, the enterprise value of the transaction was \u20ac3.1 billion ($4.2 billion). Completion of the structural integration of Cognis is targeted for the end of 2011, according to a Dec. 10, 2010, BASF press release. From a strategic perspective, although BASF's acquisition of Cognis was cen- tered on increasing its position in func- tional ingredients in nonpharmaceutical markets, such as food, personal care, and home care, the company gained ad- ditional product offerings in excipients. For example, some products of the former Cognis businesses include oleochemical- derived stearic acids, mono- and triglycerides, and castor-oil derivatives, which are used in topical, oral, and parenteral formulations. Other product offerings from the former Cog- nis businesses include chitosan, a natu- ral cationic polymer (polysaccharide), which is used in dermatology, medical applications for wound healing, tissue engineering, and as a drug-delivery agent in pharmaceutical formulations, and D- alpha 1000 succinate (TPGS), a water-soluble deriva- tive of vitamin E used to enhance the bio- availability of poorly soluble actives. In a smaller, separate deal, in Feb- ruary 2011, BASF and Sigma-Aldrich signed a global distribution agreement for several of BASF's pharmaceutical ex- cipients. Under the deal, Sigma-Aldrich will repackage the products into small pack sizes to make them available for academic-oriented R&D activities for use by universities and laboratories. The excipients portfolio offered com- prises various grades of binders (i.e., Kollidons), coatings (i.e., Kollicoats), and solubilizers (i.e., Cremophors, Lu- trols, duced Kollicoat Smartseal 30 D, a water- based dispersion for taste-masking and moisture-barrier applications, in 2010.

Industry members are responding to these concerns by improving and increasing the level of cross-company collaboration, as well as by implementing company-speci c initiatives. The best way to enhance supply chain security is for manufacturers to have intimate knowledge of materials suppliers and their methods of manufacturing, storing, and transporting the materials. However, obtaining this information can be quite resource-intensive and challenging for individual companies. Collaborative ventures between pharmaceutical manufacturers to safeguard today's extensive global supply chains are becoming more attractive to companies. Purpose The purpose of this white paper is to describe Best Practices that can be implemented by manufacturers to enhance global supply chain security. These Best Practices represent those implemented by members of Rx-360, a nonpro t consortium recently developed by volunteers from the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, including manufacturers and their suppliers. The Rx-360 mission is to enhance supply chain security and ensure the quality and authenticity of the materials moving through the supply chain.3 The organization works to enhance security and patient safety by auditing member organizations that supply materials to the pharmaceutical supply chain. Rx-360 then provides supplier audits to the organization's pharmaceutical manufacturing members to facilitate information sharing. Keep in mind that although Rx-360 can provide manufacturers with valuable information, it is still the responsibility of each Rx-360 company to make its own decision about suppliers, based on its own company product requirements, policies, and procedures.2 General A secure supply chain leads to open communication, problem prevention, constructive feedback and increased product safety\u2014all of which results in consistent and reliable products that can promote health and improve patient lives. Enhancing the safety and reliability of the pharmaceutical supply chain has become a critical component of manufacturing operations in an increasingly complex sourcing environment, with more at stake than ever.

Kollicoat Smartseal 30 D complements BASF's existing tablet coat- ings portfolio, which includes polymers and copolymers used to coat tablets, cap- sules, and pellets, and to control the release of drugs from solid dosage forms. Evonik. The specialty- and fine-chemicals company Evonik reorganized, effective Sept. 1, 2011, and combined its businesses for custom API manufacturing (i.e., exclu- sive synthesis), pharmaceutical amino acids (i.e., its Rexim product line), and pharma- ceutical polymers in a new healthcare busi- ness line. The pharmaceutical polymers business includes the company's Eudragit and Resomer product lines. The Eudragit line consists of acrylic copolymers for oral solid dosage forms, and the Resomer line includes bioresorbable poly(lactic-co-gly- colic acid) copolymers, which are used in depot formulations. Evonik acquired the Resomer business from Boehringer Ingel- heim in March 2011. Avantor Performance Chemicals. Avantor Performance Chemicals is proceeding with an expansion in India, following a key acquisition in 2010. Avantor Per- formance Chemicals was the new name given to the company after the acquisi- tion of Mallinckrodt Baker from Avan- tor's former parent company, Covidien, to the private equity group, New Moun- tain Capital. Avantor is a producer of products and materials for the pharma- ceutical industry, including excipients. In May 2011, Avantor opened a new pharmaceutical formulation application laboratory in Sinnar Nashik, Maharash- tra, India, with its partner RanQ Rem- edies. The new laboratory will be used to characterize excipients, perform func- tional testing, develop and characterize drug formulations, and support customer applications and product implementa- tion. In terms of excipients, RanQ has a position in microcrystalline cellulose and sodium starch glycolate and also has expertise in developing premixed and other application-focused pharmaceuti- cal excipients that result in a homogenous mix and coprocessed excipients. In addition to the applications labora- tory, Avantor completed construction of a pilot plant onsite at the RanQ facility. The pilot plant will be used to develop and scale up additional performance excipients to extend Avantor's J.T. Baker PanExcea product line. The PanExcea line includes performance excipients that combine fillers, binders, and disintegrants for increased functionality for immediate- release formulations and orally disinte- grating tablet applications. Other companies. Several other excipient companies are expanding. In 2011, DMV- Fonterra agreed to acquire the business and assets of Brahmar Cellulose Private Ltd. an Indian-based producer of pharmaceutical microcrystalline cellulose and sodium carboxylmethylcellulose. The acquisition, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval, is scheduled to close in the fourth quarter of 2011. In April 2011, FMC completed an expansion of its microcrystalline cellu- lose plant in Cork, Ireland.

FMC operates another microcrystalline cellulose plant in Newark, Delaware. In March 2011, Grace Davison Dis- covery Sciences, part of W.R. Grace & Co., opened a new technical service knowledge center in Southern India for customers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The new fa- cility is located in the Genome Valley near Hyderabad. The knowledge center supports Grace's customers in the areas of excipients, pharmaceutical interme- diates, laboratory separations, and bulk purification. The center also will provide product development and applications support and include such services as customer training, validation, testing for various products, and product demon- strations. The new center complements existing application laboratories in the United States, Europe, and China.In October 2010, ABITEC and Mutchler Pharmaceutical Ingredients, announced pro- vides for expanded customer service, sales, technical formulation-development support, and supply capability. Other expansions Excipient producer also are expanding in related pharmaceutical applications. For example, Huber Engineered Mate- rials (HEM), a division of J.M. Huber Corp., is expanding its Quincy, Illinois, manufacturing operations to increase capacity for calcium carbonate granula- tion production. The new addition is ex- pected to become operational in the sec- ond quarter of 2012 and generate nearly 10,000 metric tons of calcium carbonate granulation annually to serve the dietary supplement and pharmaceutical markets. The calcium carbonate granulation to be manufactured in Quincy will mirror that of the granulation line at HEM's plant in Modesto, California. The company recently received its California drug- manufacturing license for the Modesto facility and will continue to produce APIs at Quincy. Huber also produces calcium carbonate powder. Huber became a granulator of cal- cium carbonate and oyster-shell pow- ders with its 2003 acquisition of Micro Powders and Braig and added to its portfolio with the addition of West Coast Ingredients in 2006. The com- pany added to its particle-engineering capacity in 2007 with the addition of fluid-bed granulation and trituration capabilities. References 1. P.

FDA-PQRI: Process Drift FDA's Office of Compliance and Office of Pharmaceu- tical Science, both part of the Center for Drug Evalu- ation and Research (CDER), and the Product Qual- ity Research Institute (PQRI) co-chaired a workshop for industry on process drift in December 2010, in North Bethesda, MD. The workshop was well attended by par- ticipants representing industry, academia, and CDER. The program received high marks for its content and quality. The presentations were deemed relevant and compelling, with many examples illustrating a life-cycle approach to active monitoring and improving manufacturing performance. Both APIs and myriad pharmaceutical dosage forms were discussed. There was general agreement that this workshop deserves additional exposure. It was proposed that PQRI offer additional programs in the US and abroad, and publish a summary of the workshop. This article is intended to meet the latter objective. Defining process drift Process drift in the manufacture of an API or a drug product was defined by workshop attendees as: An unintended, unexplained or unexpected trend of measured process parameter(s) and/or resulting product attribute(s) away from its intended target value in a time-ordered analysis over the lifetime of a process or product. In many instances, process drift is the consequence of varia- tion in a variety of process inputs, including raw materials, manufacturing personnel, and machine (man-machine) interactions or processing conditions. In some cases, the testing of materials or measurement of process parameters may also experience drift. As an example, process drift is occurring when a unit operation of a manufacturing process moves toward the edge of its acceptable process ranges. Con- sequences can ultimately include significant variability in drug release, content uniformity, assay, or other product at-Detection, Measurement, and Control in Pharma Manufacturing PQRI-FDA Workshop Summary on Process Drift Margaret M.

Unacceptable variation during processing may lead to problems with consistency of in-process output, finished- product quality at release, or increased risk of failing speci- fication before shelf-life expiry. It is important to under- stand, monitor, and control process drift so that action can be taken before it impacts the patient. Understanding the major sources of variation is essential to the design and control of robust processes in the manu- facture of pharmaceuticals. Over time, a component or pro- cess may drift from its target due to intrinsic or extrinsic factors. These factors may initially be unknown or consid- ered to be of lesser significance. Failure to adequately con- trol processes and prevent defects can pose risk to patients/ consumers, affect product availability, and yield undesirable regulatory and business outcomes. The objectives and scope of the FDA-PQRI workshop included: Discussion of a life-cycle approach to monitoring manu - facturing performance that assures prompt detection and correction of meaningful variation Exploration of technological and management system approaches to better identify, measure, and control process variation and mitigate undesirable product variability Discussion of the impact of process drift on product performance, safety, and efficacy. Preventing process drift Prevention of process drift and continual improvement was a central theme of the workshop. In addition to the qual- ity benefits, workshop participants discussed important business efficiencies gained from improving quality, such as reduction in inventories, unexpected shutdowns, opera- tional costs, and capital expenditures. Trend monitoring is an important preventive program of a drug manufacturer to identify impending issues and allow time to investigate and resolve the problems before there is an impact on the patient. Statistical Process Control (SPC) and other time- ordered analyses can be used, ideally in real-time or shortly after completion of the process stage, to identify undesirable variation and enable appropriate action. Such early-warning systems enable detection of intra-batch and inter-batch pro- cess drift in a pharmaceutical operation and are an integral part of a 21st-Century quality system. Suitable quality stan- dards for APIs, excipients, container-closure systems, and drug products must be designed, implemented, monitored and periodically evaluated by persons involved in pharma- ceutical manufacturing and quality control/quality assur- ance, including management. Senior management's role was strongly emphasized as central to an organization's success at achieving proactive quality assurance rather than reactive quality control. Modern technology and process control approaches were discussed. Detection, diagnosis, and enhanced upstream control of process variables can be modeled and process trajectory more tightly measured and controlled to en- sure consistent material output. With this enhanced qual- ity information for each unit operation, intelligent control systems can be employed to provide dynamic feedback for larger manufacturing process improvement efforts. This improved knowledge will enable the impact of changes to the product or process to be predicted better so that the undesirable impact on product quality and stability can be prevented. Ultimately, enhanced process information will facilitate a state of process control (including continuous process verification) throughout the life cycle and yield drug quality benefits to both industry and consumers. When robust systems are not implemented and capable tools are not used to prevent process drift, resulting manu- facturing problems may include: low product yield, batch delays, ingredient and packaging variability, batch failures, product quality-related clinical failures, investigations, re- calls, product seizures, injunctions, and consent decrees. Detection and resolution of process drift was discussed for APIs, key excipients, and a variety of dosage forms (solid orals, transdermals, topicals, injectables, metered-dose in- halers and dry powder inhalers). The impact of alternate source qualification for drug product ingredients and pack- aging components was also included. The effect of process drift on specifications and shelf-life was addressed. In ad- dition, participants discussed proper supplier management, product quality monitoring and control systems (e.g., PAT), corrective and preventive action (CAPA) programs, and quality-by-design (QbD) approaches. Each approach was considered an integral piece to establishing and maintain- ing a stable manufacturing system. Breakout sessions Breakout sessions among participants focused on: The definitions and terms for describing process varia - tion and process drift The most frequent causes of variation in pharmaceutical manufacturing Current strategies for monitoring and detecting process variability Evolutions in industry management approaches and the regulatory environment that could promote more proactive process improvement throughout the product life cycle Impact of process drift on product bioavailability, safety, and efficacy. The following section summarizes key outcomes of the breakout sessions. Workshop participants recognized \"process drift\" as an \"unintended, unexplained, or unexpected trend of measured process parameter(s) and/or resulting product attribute(s) away from its intended target value in a time-ordered analy- sis over the lifetime of a process or product.\" When a substantial number of errors that occurred in pharmaceutical manufacturing were analyzed over a speci-FDA-PQRI: Process Drift400 Iroquois Shore Rd, (866) 337-4500 | Fax: (905) 337-7239 Manufacturing Quality Clinical Packaging Distribution Service www.wellspringcmo.comOur ability is your solution WellSpring is a unique CMO offering full-service clinical and commercial manufacturing, packaging, and analytical services from a single FDA audited and Health Canada licensed facility.

Human errors are due to inad- equate training, poorly understood standard operating procedures and processing parameters, lack of skill sets and procedural control, and inad- equate resources. Other sources are in- adequate change management and risk management. Unsuitable equipment, deficient preventive maintenance, and inadequate equipment calibration also lead to movement away from the nor- mal process variability. Inadequate un- derstanding of the inherent variability in and inappropriate characterization of excipients, APIs, and other compo- nents can lead to unacceptable process variation and can be one of the most complex areas to track during the life cycle of a pharmaceutical product. Scientific rationale is needed to select variables on which to focus most when monitoring process drift. For raw ma- terials, the certificate-of-analysis (CoA) testing alone is insufficient to deter- mine excipient variability. In compari- son with commonly used univariate analyses, use of multivariate analyti- cal methods for assessing properties of raw materials, in-process materials, and finished products by modeling relevant material attributes and process variables can support increased qual- ity assurance. However, appropriate education, training, and manufacturing process understanding is necessary to properly use these methods. Analytical method drift should also be monitored. Evolutions in industry management approaches could promote a more pro- active process improvement throughout the life cycle of a product. Justification to senior management is necessary to design and implement quality assur- ance concepts. Workshop participants agreed that upper management must support the efforts to assure drug qual- ity and understand the inherent costs of poor quality. Estimation of the cost of failure can provide an indication of the ramifications and support the resources needed. Better metrics are needed to quantify the risk-benefit ratio. Participants also indicated that the regulatory landscape needs to be more predictable. Some also felt that the time and cost to provide information to the regulators and receive approval for pro- cess improvements can be prohibitive. Process drift has the potential to af- fect product performance for all types of dosage forms. More meaningful ana- lytical tools for understanding and de- tecting process drift are needed. Iden- tification and use of improved input material measurements and process information are necessary to improve the likelihood of alerting a manufac- turer to process variability that may impact product quality, including drug bioavailability. For example, to date, the best in vitro marker available to industry for drug bioavailability is dissolution. Even when in vitro-in vivo correlation is not conclusively estab- lished, significant emerging changes in product quality and manufacturing consistency are detected by testing a compressed tablet for tablet disintegra- tion and drug dissolution. Overall, the participants felt that fur- ther work is needed to develop better methods that recognize and enhance understanding of the effects of process drift on product quality and product performance. Conclusion Feedback obtained from FDA-PQRI workshop attendees through a post- event survey has been positive. The topic of enhancing life-cycle manage- ment of process drift should be elabo- rated at future workshops, including discussion of advancements and in- novations in manufacturing technol- ogy that allow for dynamic process control.

The introduc- tory article explaining the history and structure of the series, as well as the first case study on defining design space, ap- peared in the July 2011 issue of P harmaceutical Technology (1).

The deviation A drug product site produces pain-free capsules, which are indicated as an anti-epileptic and for treatment of neuro- pathic pain. Multiple customer complaints of empty cap- sules were received. Lot ABC was fully distributed in the United States and no product remains within company control. There is no evidence of tampering. Batch record review indicated that during processing, a loose dosator was replaced on the encapsulation equipment. Follow- ing replacement\u2014and prior to resuming encapsulation, accep- tance testing of capsules produced required by standard operat- ing procedure was performed and product met requirements. Further investigation revealed that the loose dosator caused empty capsules to be produced. The encapsulation system used a vacuum system to remove empty capsules. This empty capsule removal system includes a reservoir for holding empty capsules rejected during the manufacturing process. As a re- sult of the loose dosator, an atypically high number of reject empty/low fill capsules were produced during the encapsula- tion operation, causing the reservoir to be filled and eventu- ally overflow. The reservoir was physically located over the ac- ceptable capsule flow. Therefore, it was determined during the Process Deviation and Empty Product Capsules A Risk-Management Case Study (Part 4) Ted Frank, Stephen Brooks, Kristin Murray, Steve Reich, Ed Sanchez, Brian Hasselbalch, Kwame Obeng, and Richard CreekmoreMASS SPECTROMETRY Innovation with IntegrityAt Daltonics, we've developed an entire portfolio of Mass Spectrometry Solutions designed to help you efciently and effectively get the results you need.

Sealed bottles were obtained from re- maining inventory of the lot. Of 30,661 capsules examined, 151 empty and 5 low-fill weight capsules were found. During the inventory evaluation, one to five empty capsules were found in 46% of the bottles evaluated. In the this case study, the manufac- turer decides to use quality risk man- agement to evaluate the potential impact of the deviation. Risk question and risk-assessment method The risk question developed for the subject case study is: Do a small number of potential low fill or empty capsules in a single batch of pain-free capsules pose an unacceptable risk to patients, and secondarily, to the company? In this case study, the risk factors are more qualitative than quantitative. Failure-mode effects analysis (FMEA) is specifi- cally designed to systematically study processes for possible failure modes and then to develop actions to mitigate these failure modes. An element that requires consideration in this case study is detectability of the defect. Is it possible for the pharmacist or the patient to readily detect empty capsules? The FMEA technique is an optimal tool for this application as the standard methodology includes all three risk components (i.e., probability, severity, and detectability). Therefore, the risk methodology selected for the subject case study is: FMEA. Risk identification, analysis, and evaluation The FMEA process used intends to identify potential risks that could result from empty capsules in the market and the possible consequences of each risk. It is understood that sufficient data may not always be available to reach conclusions, and identifi- cation of risks should be based on best available data, scientific knowledge, and historical experience. The rationale used to identify risks should be documented. Examples of potential risks include the following: patients may receive empty capsules, patients may not have availability of medically necessary product, the company could receive an audit observation from an internal auditor or external regu- latory agency, and so forth.Numerical ratings for the FEMA analysis are based on the following criteria: Severity of the failure Frequency of the failure Ability to detect the parameter. A numerical ranking of 1-3 is applied to each evaluated haz- ard, as demonstrated in the example FMEA risk-score ranking table using a three-point ranking scale (see Table I). In the FMEA analysis executed for this case study, the firm determined that, if there was potential for greater than a moderate risk-evaluation score, appropriate risk mitigating actions would be required to lower the risk to an acceptable level. Therefore, If the score for an evaluated hazard exceeds 9, corrective measures to the reduce risk of failure will be taken. If after attempting risk mitigation, the score could not be lowered below 9, the resulting risk would not be accepted. For those items with a score below the defined threshold, risks will be accepted. Conclusions are documented. An example worksheet for calculating the Risk Evaluation Score for this analysis is presented in Table II. Risk control In the current case study, risk-reduction and acceptance de- cisions centered on patient safety. Despite the apparently low number of empty/low fill capsules that may be present, there was no assurance that the numbers of empty capsules in the market was low. There was little ability for a pharmacist or patient to detect an empty or partially filled capsule. Most importantly, the potential medical consequence for some patients due to receiving and administering an empty or partially filled capsule was severe. As a result of the poten- tially high risk associated with some patients taking empty/ low-fill capsules, and the inability of the firm to implement appropriate risk mitigating actions to lower this risk (i.e., severity and ability to detect) to an acceptable level, the deci- sion was taken to initiate a product recall. Risk documentation and communication Site procedures require preparation and Quality division endorsement of a deviation report. The risk assessment output was incorporated into a number of existing work processes and their associated documentation. To prevent reintroduction of rejected product to the product, an auto- mated sensor was incorporated into the empty-capsule reject reservoir. When activated, this sensor automatically shuts down the encapsulation machine should rejected capsules in the reservoir reach the sensor level, thereby preventing overflow. The overflow sensor with automated equipment shutdown was applied to all encapsulation machines at the firm.

Accepted: June 13, 2011.Quality Control On-line measurement methods are often used to implement the process analytical technology (PAT) approach to process understanding and control and offer many advantages over traditional pharmaceuti- cal analytical methods. PAT tends to be fast and nondestruc- tive, and the tools can be integrated into the manufacturing process stream relatively easily. PAT helps improve process understanding and enhance control of product quality. A well-developed PAT method can be applied to perform real- time release testing on a large number of samples per batch. It is not surprising that the application of PAT to the test- ing of the uniformity of dosage units (UDU) has been the subject of extensive discussion between industry groups and regulatory agencies. The harmonized UDU test (hUSP) currently described in US Pharmacopeia <905> is the result of the International Conference on Harmonization's (ICH) effort to harmonize the US, EU, and Japanese pharmacopoeia tests and to ensure the consistency of the dosage units within a narrow range around the label claim (1). The hUSP flow chart is summa- rized in Figure 1. Using operating characteristic curves to evaluate the performance of the hUSP test The characteristics of the hUSP test can be summarized by a set of operating characteristic (OC) curves. A UDU test's OC curve is conventionally presented as the probability of lot ac- ceptance ( P) versus one key distribution parameter ( Q). As- suming the test is characterized by its sample size ( n), with possibly other distributional parameters, this relationship can be mathematically defined by the following equation: P = f (Q| n, other distribution parameters) Eq. 1 Often Q = standard deviation. However, it is common to re- place the standard deviation by coverage, which is defined as the percentage of dosage units within an acceptable potency range. It is assumed that the acceptable range is between 85% and 115% of the label claim (LC).Assessment of Large-Sample Unit-Dose Uniformity Tests Through Limiting Discriminatory Thresholds Yanhui Hu and David LeBlondFILM FORMING AND COATING POLYMERS s Modied starch-based polymers - LYCOAT\u00ae s Tablet coating - LYCOAT\u00ae RS FAST DISSOLVE AND CHEWABLE TABLETS (ODT) s Mannitol powders - PEARLITOL\u00ae C s Mannitol compound - PEARLITOL\u00ae Flash for ODT' s s Sorbitol powders - NEOSORB\u00ae P DILUENTS AND FILLERS FOR TABLETS /CAPSULES s Mannitol powders - PEARLITOL\u00ae C s Starche s (native, modied and pregelatinized) s Maltodextrin - GLUCIDEX\u00ae DIRECT COMPRESSION s Mannitol for direct compression - PEARLITOL\u00ae DC and SD s Sorbitol powder s - NEOSORB\u00ae P and NEOSORB\u00ae P DC s Xylitol - XYLISORB\u00ae DC s Partially pregelatinized starch - LYCATAB\u00ae C BINDERS FOR WET GRANULATION s Pregelatinized starch - LYCATAB\u00ae PGS s Partially pregelatinized starch - LYCATAB\u00ae C MOLECULAR , TASTE-MASKING grades) DISINTEGRANTS AND SUPERDISINTEGRANTS s Wheat starch, corn starch, potato starch DIETARY FIBER, PROTEINS AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS s Soluble dextrin - NUTRIOSE\u00ae FB and NUTRIOSE\u00ae FM s Non-GMO pea protein - NUTRALYS\u00aes Mannitol for direct compression - PEARLITOL\u00ae DC and SD s Xylitol - XYLISORB\u00ae s Co-processed starch and lactose - STARLAC\u00ae s Maltitol powders - SweetPearl \u00ae s Partially pregelatinized starch - LYCATAB\u00ae C s Dextrose s Mannitol compound - PEARLITOL\u00ae Flash s Maltitol powders - SweetPearl \u00ae DC s Co-processed starch and lactose - STARLAC \u00ae s Betacyclodextrin for direct compression - KLEPTOSE\u00ae DC s Maltodextrin - LYCATAB\u00ae DSHs Ready to us e system - ReadiLYCOAT \u00ae s Thin lm delivery pyrogen Maltitol syrup - Mannitol - PF GLYCOLYS\u00ae s s Chlorella microalga - ALGOMED\u00ae www.roquettepharma.comROQUETTE, through its production units (in Europe, in Asia and in the United States) and its international distribution network, will assure a constant quality of products and services throughout the whole world. \u00ae Registered trademark of Roquette Fr\u00e8res - \u00a9 Roquette Fr\u00e8res S.A. - 08/2011Supplier performance and reliability as good as it should be?84 Pharmaceutical Technology OctOber 2011 PharmTech.comQuality Control Representative OC curves obtained assuming a normal distribution and a target assay of 100% LC are shown in Figure 2. Under these assumptions, the performance of the hUSP test is sym- metrical around 100% LC batch mean. Thus, only the range of 90% to 100% LC of the batch mean needs to be evaluated. It is evident from Figure 2 that the prob- ability of passing the test is quite simi- lar for batches with mean assay between 94% and 100% LC because of the design characteristics of the hUSP test. Large sample size UDU test proposals The hUSP test is designed to accommo- date a small sample size (i.e., as many as 30 units), but PAT-associated on-line methods permit a much larger sample size from each commercial batch. An alternative \"large n\" UDU test is thus needed. Several proposals have ap- peared in recent years, and a brief re- view is provided below. Sandell proposal. Sandell et al. proposed a nonparametric counting test for sample sizes between 100 and 10,000 units (2). The maximum number of defect units, whose content exceeds the range of 85-115% LC, is equal to the median of the binomial distribution defined by a sample size (n), and a defect probability of 1 0.952 = 0.048. The authors demonstrated that the test has lower acceptance probability than that of the hUSP test as long as the probability is at or below 50%. However, the choice of the binomial median and defect probability of 0.048 is somewhat arbitrary and remains a point of controversy. Bergum and Vukovinsky proposal. Bergum and Vukovinsky suggested a nonparametric test with a defect-count limit equal to the largest integer less than or equal to 3% of total sample size (3). OC curves are used to make various compari- sons with the Sandell and hUSP tests. However, as with San- dell's proposal, the choice of 3% seems somewhat arbitrary. Diener proposals. Diener et al. proposed several parametric alternatives for sample sizes in the range of 31 to 99 (4). As they did with Sandell's approach, the authors demon- strated with OC curves that their tests were more stringent for batches with at most 95.2% coverage. But, again, it is not clear that the inherent quality levels that the tests represent are widely accepted. The key to any large sample UDU test is to define the un- derlying quality threshold that distinguishes an acceptable batch. Each of the above proposals makes assumptions about the acceptable coverage or defect rate. For example, both Sandell's and Diener's approaches chose 95.2% coverage as the quality requirement, while the Bergum and Vukovinsky proposal led (in the large sample limit) to a coverage of 97% as the quality requirement. The quality requirement of a large-sample UDU test should ensure good product quality and should be at least as stringent as the quality require- ment of the hUSP test. OC curves are often used to evaluate large-sample UDU tests, but they depend on test character- istics (e.g., sample size) and parameters of the population distribution, thus requiring the generation and unwieldy comparison of a large number of OC curves. It would seem desirable to summarize the performance of any proposed large-sample UDU test using a single quality criterion.Figure 1: The harmonized uniformity of dosage units (UDU) (hUSP) test flowchart.

ALL fIgureS Are courTeSy of The AuThorS86 Pharmaceutical Technology OctOber 2011 PharmTech.comLimiting discriminatory threshold Formally, a limiting discriminatory threshold (LDT) is de- fined as the large sample limit of the inverse of the prob- ability of acceptance function in Eq. 1. The concept of LDT for a large-sample UDU test is motivated by the following ideas and assumptions: 1. The key critical quality parameter of content uniformity is coverage. 2. A coverage threshold of less than 100% that unambigu- ously distinguishes between acceptable and unaccept- able batches should be agreed upon. 3. UDU tests exhibit both Type I (i.e., rejection of accept- able batches) and Type II (i.e., acceptance of unaccept- able batches) errors. As sample sizes increase, the test becomes more discriminatory. In the ideal limit of in- finite sample size (i.e., the true coverage of each lot is known with absolute certainty), the error probabilities are zero, and the OC curve is a step function. In this article, the coverage at which this transition occurs is called the LDT, defined in the following equation as the converging limit with increasing sample size: LDT for all P = lim . . ) Eq. 2 n/uni2192.alt1 4. The LDT of a given UDU test represents its inherent quality-discriminating threshold in the ideal limit of complete knowledge (i.e., infinite sample size) and can be determined algebraically or by computer simulation. 5. To be considered equally stringent, UDU tests, at a min- imum, should have the same LDT. Tests with the same LDT may approach the LDT at different rates as sample size increases. When comparing two large-sample UDU tests that have the same LDT, the test that approaches the LDT more rapidly can be considered more efficient. An LDT of 100%, while certainly desirable, is not realistic because of inherent analytical uncertainty. The LDT and the rate of approach to the LDT will depend not only on the test itself, but, in some cases (e.g., parametric tests), also on the distribution of the population from which samples are drawn. The LDT concept may not be limited to single coverage, but is applied to the 85-115% LC coverage here for illustration. In principle, the concept could be extended to multivariate quality metrics (e.g., joint coverage of 75-125% and 85-115% LC ranges), although that approach is not considered here. It is legitimate and useful to determine the LDT for com- pendial tests (e.g., hUSP test) that employ fixed sample sizes. Such tests rarely define a quality requirement (i.e., the re- quired coverage to pass the test) explicitly. When a defini- tive quality metric, such as coverage, can be identified, LDT provides a reasonable way to reverse engineer the intended standard of quality. Multistage tests are often designed such that the acceptability range is widened as the fixed sample size (i.e., stage) increases because the estimation of the population information has improved. This design reduces the risk of the Type I error and maintains a nominal Type II error rate. Ulti-mately, the criteria applied at the final stage set the standard for expected quality and decision error rates. Consequently, when evaluating the LDT of fixed-sample-size tests, the ac- ceptance criteria of the final stage should be kept constant with changing sample size. If the content of all individual units were known, the coverage would be known exactly and could be compared with the LDT that is inherent to the final stage of the test. This procedure effectively assumes that batch acceptance would be based on the perfect knowledge of the batch uniformity, had it been available. LDT estimation for the hUSP zero-tolerance criterion Eq. 2 is used to estimate the LDT of the nonparametric zero- tolerance (ZT) criterion in Stage 2 of the hUSP test. Assum- ing that a batch true mean is at the target potency of 100% LC, the ZT criterion requires all tested units to be within the range of 75-125% LC. If Q represents the true 75-125% LC coverage of the batch, the probability of acceptance (Eq. 1) is expressed in the following equation: P = f (Q|n) = Qn Eq. 3 The above equation may be inverted to solve for Q, thus yielding the following result: Q = f-1 (P|n) = P1/n Eq. 4 Substituting the above equation into Eq. 2 and solving for the limit yields the following result: LDT for all P = lim f-1 (P|n) = P0 = 1 Eq. 5 n/uni2192.alt1 Thus, the hUSP ZT criterion inherently would require a 75-125% LC coverage of 100%, which, as argued above, can- not be attained with existing technologies. The ZT criterion is useful as a failsafe in the current hUSP test to protect against an accidental serious failure that is not otherwise detected because of the small sample size. However, the ZT criterion in large-sample-size UDU tests may be unnecessarily stringent and dissuade personnel from performing testing. LDT estimation for the hUSP test without the ZT criterion The hUSP test does not explicitly define the inherent quality requirement. Because the test only applies to a small sample size, it will exhibit nonzero Type I and Type II errors. The test effectively establishes an acceptable standard for the Type I error probability that is determined by the Stage 2 cri- teria. Therefore, the LDT for the hUSP test without the ZT requirement, referred to as hUSP ( ZT) can be determined solely based on the Stage 2 acceptance-value requirement. This LDT can serve as a benchmark of the quality level that is expected in production batches. Assuming a target potency (T) of 100% LC, the Stage 2 AV requirement can be expressed by the following equation: Qalityo Cnry/r.scniXRPD, a nondestructive technique, coupled with our comprehensive database is useful for preformulation, drug development, and patent applications.Visit us at AAPS Booth #1446International Centre for Diffraction Data Databases from the Database Experts Enhance Productivity PDF-4/Organics 2012 A comprehensive materials database featuring 470,181 phases. www.icdd.com marketing@icdd.com Phone: 610.325.9814 Toll-free: (U.S. & Canada) Designed for rapid materials identification Polymorph Screening Quality Control Drug & Excipients Identification Formulation Analysis Quantitative Analysis Polymorph Identification Crystallite Size88 Pharmaceutical Technology OctOber 2011 PharmTech.comQuality Control AV = |X_ - M| + 2 S L1 Eq. 6 Figure 1 contains definitions of L , M, S , and X . For a normal population distribution, lim X_ and lim S , where and are the true batch mean and stan- dard deviation. Thus, in the large sample limit, given a batch mean, the largest acceptable value for the batch standard deviation is expressed by the following equation: Eq. 7 The batch means above 100% LC are the mirror images of the ones below 100%, and thus are not considered in Eq. 7. The limiting coverage at large sample size is expressed in the following equation: Eq. 8 in which N(x|\u00b5,LDT) is the normal probability density func- tion. The LDT for a normal population distribution (Eq. 8) is shown in Figure 3 as a function of population mean. The LDTs are 95.45% and 95.96% for batch means of 100% LC and 96% LC, respectively. The dip in LDT curve at batch mean of 98.5% LC results from the indifference zone of the hUSP test. Clearly, the most stringent coverage requirement of about 96% occurs at a batch mean near 96% LC. This requirement is more conservative than that of Sandell (i.e., 95.2%), but less conservative than that of Bergum and Vu- kovinsky (i.e., 97%). Determining the efficiency of the hUSP ( ZT) test Monte-Carlo simulation was used to determine the ap- proach to LDT for the hUSP ( ZT) test as sample size in- creases. In these simulations, half of the total units ( n) were tested at Stage 1 and the other half at stage 2, if necessary. Therefore, a test with sample size n may only use half of its total units. The coverage required to achieve a specified probability of acceptance, given a normal batch mean, was determined iteratively. Figure 4 illustrates the coverage re- quired to achieve 10% and 90% probability of acceptance (P10 and P 90, respectively) for two cases of batch means (96% LC and 100% LC). P 10 and P 90 coverage are plotted against the inverse of the square root of sample size. P10 and P90 of the hUSP test ( n = 30, including the ZT requirement) is also given in Figure 4. A batch with 89% cov- erage will have 10% probability to pass the hUSP test, while coverage of 98% is needed to pass the hUSP test with 90% probability. These coverage values are essentially the same for the two batch means, as implied by the overlapping OC curves for batch means between 94% and 100% LC. Other data points in Figure 4 are simulated without the ZT criterion. With increasing sample sizes, P10 and P90 coverage converge to the LDTs identified in Figure 3, thus indicating the increasing discrimination power with increasing sample sizes. With a batch mean of 100% LC, P10 and P 90 converge to an LDT of 95.4%. This LDT is the inherent quality-level re- quirement of the hUSP ( ZT) in the ideal state where the con- tent of all units in a batch are known. Figure 4 also shows that the LDT is 96% for a batch mean of 96% LC, thus matching the data in Figure 3. The differences in the LDTs for various batch means indicate the hUSP test is not totally independent of the batch mean. The choice of acceptance probabilities of 10 and 90% (i.e., P10 and P 90) to represent the rate of convergence is arbi- trary. It is desirable to choose probabilities that are extreme enough to illustrate convergence yet are not so extreme as to require excessive computer simulation time. Although all coverage lines should converge to the same LDTs, it is possible that other probability pairs (e.g., 5% and 95% or 20% and 80%) could lead to different conclusions about test efficiency. The chosen probability pairs should be consistent across the tests being compared.Figure 3: Limiting discrimination threshold (LDT) coverage of the hUSP(-ZT) test as a function of batch means, assuming a normal population distribution and target assay of 100% label claim (LC).

Washington Convention Center Washington, DC, USA Booth #2716 90 Pharmaceutical Technology OctOber 2011 PharmTech.comTogether, Figures 3 and 4 establish the inherent quality re- quirements of the hUSP test for the content range of 85-115% LC, as well as the convergent rates of the hUSP test toward the inherent quality requirements (LDTs). Jointly, these fig- ures serve as useful tools for assessing large-sample UDU tests. A satisfactory large-sample UDU test should have LDTs no less than those of the hUSP test and should converge relatively quickly toward the LDTs. These two assessment criteria can be demonstrated using Sandell's proposal as an example. Evaluation of the LDT of Sandell's proposal As stated above, the Sandell limit is equal to the median of the binomial distribution defined by a sample size n and a defect probability p of 1 0.952 = 0.048. For a large n, this binomial distribution approaches (by the central limit theorem) the normal distribution with mean (median) of np. Thus, at infinite sample size, an acceptable batch will have no more than 4.8% of all units outside 85-115% LC. Thus, the LDT coverage of Sandell's proposal is 95.2%. As a nonparametric test, the Sandell LDT is independent of as- sumed batch mean. Figure 5a superimposes the LDT of Sandell's proposal as a horizontal line on the LDTs from the hUSP ( ZT) test for a normal population distribution. Clearly, Sandell's pro- posal is not uniformly as stringent as the hUSP test. The P10 and P 90 coverage lines for Sandell's proposal are shown in Figure 5b. For comparison, the coverage lines from hUSP (ZT) test assuming a batch mean of 100% LC are also plotted. The angle of convergence of Sandell's proposal is only slightly greater than that of the hUSP ( ZT) test. For tests that include as many as 1000 samples, the P90 coverage line from Sandell's test is at or above the corresponding line from the hUSP ( ZT) test, thus indicating that Sandell's approach has a higher risk of Type I errors than that of the hUSP (ZT) test. Furthermore, the P10 coverage line from Sandell's proposal is lower than that of the hUSP ( ZT) test, thus indicating that Sandell's approach has a higher risk of Type II error as well. Sandell's coverage lines can be com- pared with those of the hUSP test for other batch means as well, although this article will not discuss this comparison. In summary, a nonparametric test that does not rely on the batch mean must have at least a 96% LDT coverage for the test to be considered as stringent as the hUSP test for all batch means. Furthermore, the P10 and P90 coverage lines of a proposed test should be contained within those of the hUSP ( ZT), as shown in Figure 5b. A P90 coverage line above that of the hUSP ( ZT) test indicates a higher risk of Type I error, with potential negative effect on the business operation. Similarly, a P10 coverage line below that of the hUSP (ZT) test indicates a higher risk of Type II error, potentially harming the marketed product's quality.

Such distri- butions might be present in batches for which the unit-dose potency variance is not constant during manufacturing. The nonstandard t-distribution, indexed by \u00b5, , and df (i.e., degrees of freedom), is such a distribution. In this case, the limiting coverage at large sample size is expressed in the following equation: Eq. 9 in which t(x|\u00b5, LDT, df) is the nonstandard t probability density function. Figure 6 shows how LDT coverage varies as a function of the assumed batch mean. The LDT for the hUSP ( ZT) was calculated for various nonstandard t distributions (indexed by the t-distribution parameter df) using Eq. 9. The LDT for the nonparametric Sandell test does not depend on assump- tions about the population distribution and thus remains constant. The hUSP ( ZT) LDT for the normal distribution is also shown for comparison. With increasing degrees of freedom, the LDT coverage pro- file of a nonstandard t distribution approaches that of the nor- mal population distribution, as expected. With lower degrees of freedom, the LDTs are less stringent for batches with means at or above 96% LC, but more stringent for batches with lower means. Between 96% and 100% LC batch means, the effect of df on the LDTs is surprisingly minimal, thus indicating the robustness of the hUSP test with respect to the changes in the greatly deviating units. Again, Sandell's proposal does not provide as stringent a requirement as the hUSP test does under the assumption of a nonstandard t distribution. Discussion and conclusion This article introduced and illustrated the LDT criterion for evaluating the performance and efficiency of large-sample UDU test proposals. The intent was not to introduce a new proposal or to provide a definitive evaluation of any specific large-sample UDU test, but merely to suggest an objective way of comparing test proposals and of ensuring that large- sample UDU tests will meet or exceed the quality standard set by the hUSP test. The LDTs for parametric tests generally depend on the parameters of the assumed population distribution. For il- lustration, LDTs were examined for normal and t distribu- tions. In principle, LDTs could be evaluated against other distributions that include skewness (e.g., log normal) or bi- modality (e.g., mixed normal). The authors used 85-115% LC as the range of interest for defining coverage, although other ranges (e.g., 75-125% LC) may also be of interest. Fur- thermore, the LDT approach could be extended to quality measures other than coverage, or to multivariate measures. It may not always be possible to calculate the LDT of a test directly by algebra and intuitive arguments. However, the LDT can always be obtained by extrapolation to a large sample size using simulation. This article showed how cov- erage corresponding to the 10% and 90% acceptance prob- abilities varied as a function of the sample size, which can be used to evaluate and compare the power and efficiency of competing tests. To ensure that quality standards are maintained at an ap- propriate level, it is imperative that common quality criteria be identified and adopted. This article presents the LDT approach to assist in reaching this common goal. References 1.

Accepted: June 24, 2011.Dry Powder Coating Efficient handling and transport of fine-particle powders can be difficult because of the highly cohesive nature of the bulk powder mass. It is well reported in the literature that the application of nanosized guest dry powder coatings, such as silicon dioxide, onto the surfaces of these cohesive host particles can effectively reduce the attractive forces between them (1-5). The fine nanoparticles increase the spacing between the host particles and increase the apparent surface roughness, which decreases the host particle cohesive van der Waals attractions (5, 6). After dry powder coating, the bulk powder exhibits increased bulk density, improved powder flow performance, and easy fluidization behavior, all of which can significantly improve manufacturing performance (1-5). This result is of significant benefit to pharmaceutical powder processing because the easy transport of large bulk quantities of powder through unit operations is necessary to manufacture solid dosage forms such as capsules and tablets. It was recently demonstrated that conventional pharmaceutical processing equipment, namely a comil, can effectively apply dry powder coatings of silicon dioxide onto active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and excipients without causing attrition of the host's primary particles (1). This discovery is important because comils can be operated in a continuous manufacturing process and are commonly available at pharmaceutical product manufacturing sites. Although the comil is a simple, effective, and scalable unit operation for applying dry powder coatings, the systematic study of the process operational design space, such as screen size and impeller speed, may be required to optimize the coating performance. This iterative method may not be possible in early drug product development because of the limited available quantities of API (often less than 50 g) and the potential for improved performance after dry powder coating may be overlooked, especially as API synthesis, isolation, and sizing processes change often. Therefore, alternative (or complementary) methods for applying dry powder coatings would be desirable during early product development.Applying Dry Powder Coatings Using a Resonant Acoustic Mixer to Improve Powder Flow and Bulk Density Matthew P. Mullarney, Lauren E. Beach, Beth A. Langdon, and Mark A. Polizzi96 Pharmaceutical Technology OctOber 2011 PharmTech.comDry Powder Coating A laboratory scale resonant acoustic mixer (LabRAM) similar to the one shown in Figure 1 was evaluated as a potential tool for dry powder coating (7, 8). The LabRAM is a sophisticated bench-top mixer that exploits low frequency, high intensity, acoustic energy to rapidly fluidize and disperse as much as 500 g of a variety of materials. The RAM uses acoustic energy to mix the desired media through an oscillating mechanical driver that accelerates the mixing vessel by as much as 100 times the acceleration of gravity. The propagation of mechanical energy through a system of plates, weights, and springs creates an acoustic pressure wave in the mixing vessel. The frequency of the driver is optimized by the control system so that the system operates at resonance. By operating at resonance, the acoustic energy is absorbed by the media. The efficient mixing is accomplished by creating a homogenous shear zone throughout the mixing vessel without imparting excess energy and without the aid of mixing media or impellers. This approach seems promising because the RAM can mix at high acceleration and amplitude and therefore induce significant shear strain within the bulk powder in a short time. Related work by Dav\u00e9 and coworkers has demonstrated that when high degrees of shear are induced (e.g., by impact coaters) to disperse fine particles, the particles preferentially adhere to the surface of larger host particles after processing (2, 3, 5). In this study, the RAM was evaluated as a tool for applying various dry powder coatings, such as silicon dioxide, to pharmaceutical excipients and APIs. The effect of these coatings on powder bulk density, particle size, and shear cell flow performance were used as indicators of performance enhancement, and the results were compared to those of dry powder coating using a comil. Materials and methods A selection of pharmaceutical powders were chosen as host particles with different particle sizes, particle shapes, and chemistry: ibuprofen (50 grade and 90 grade, BASF), acetaminophen (micronized, Mallinckrodt Baker), proprietary active pharmaceutical ingredients (API \"A\" and API \"B,\" Pfizer), mannitol (powder grade, SPI Pharma), and lactose monohydrate (310 grade, Foremost Farms). Four guest particles were selected and represented a range of small microsized or nanosized particles commonly used as glidants or lubricants in solid dosage formulations: hydrophobic silicon dioxide (Aerosil R972, Evonik/Degussa), hydrophilic grade, Brenntag Specialties), and magnesium stearate (HyQual, Mallinckrodt Baker). RAM dry powder coating. A resonant acoustic mixer (LabRAM, 500 g capacity, Resodyn) was used to prepare the coated particles in small batches (~20 g). The host and guest particles were placed into amber glass bottles and mixed for as much as 10 min at a frequency of 60-61 Hz and a mechanical driver magnitude of 75-80 times the acceleration of gravity. The mixing oscillation mixing frequency was optimized by the RAM driver control module to mix the powder at resonance. Comil dry powder coating. An overdriven comil (model 197, Quadro Engineering) was also used to prepare dry- coated particles. Details of this approach for coating were previously reported (1). This process required the selection of comil operating conditions (i.e., screens, impeller, operating speed, and the powder feeding rate) to maximize dispersion of the guest particles and enable throughput without screen blinding. A round-edged impeller rotating at a tip speed of 2.4 m/s and round hole screens (0.457 to 0.813 mm opening) were selected to maximize residence time and minimize host-particle attrition. The screen opening size was slightly above the maximum particle size of the host particle and the powder was manually charged to the mill at 10-200 g/min. Powder characterization. Photomicrographs were taken with a scanning electron microscope (FEI Quanta 200, FEI) using a working distance of 10 mm with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. The particle-size distribution was determined using a laser-diffraction particle-size analyzer (Sympatec HELOS/RODOS, Sympatec) with dry dispersion bulk density was determined using the USP <616> method. The flow behavior of powders equilibrated at 50% relative humidity was determined using an annular shear cell (Schulze Ring Shear Tester model using a preconsolidation stress of 4 kPa. The ratio of the principal consolidation stress to the unconfined yield strength was used to calculate the flow function coefficient (FFC). The FFC was used as an indicator of powder flow performance. Powders with FFC values between 4 and 10 were considered easy flowing, and higher FFC values indicate superior flow behavior (9).Figure 1: Laboratory-scale resonant acoustic mixer (LabRAM), including the vacuum-deaeration unit (left), mixing unit (center), and control unit (right).

An examination of the ibuprofen and acetaminophen host particles after mixing showed slight changes to the surfaces of some of the host particles when processed in the RAM without silicon dioxide. Figure 2 shows what appears to be surface melting of an ibuprofen particle after mixing without silicon dioxide. Considering the relatively low melting point of ibuprofen (~70 C), this suggests that interparticle friction may have increased the temperature of the powder during processing significantly above ambient laboratory temperature (20-25 C). Some particle-particle abrasion may also have occurred during mixing in the absence of a glidant. However, the melting and abrasion did not appear in samples that were mixed with silicon dioxide, presumably because the glidant acted to significantly reduce the friction during mixing. No appreciable changes in particle size, morphology, or surface texture were observed for the acetaminophen particles. Further investigation is recommended to determine whether any significant heat was generated during the process, which may cause physical changes to sensitive host particles. The particle-size distributions of the unprocessed ibuprofen and acetaminophen host particles were compared with the silicon dioxide mixed powders after 10 minutes of processing to determine whether appreciable host particle attrition or agglomeration had occurred (see Table I). The apparent particle size of the two ibuprofen powders slightly increased after mixing with silicon dioxide. There was no appreciable change in the particle size of the acetaminophen after mixing with silicon dioxide. It is hypothesized that the smallest ibuprofen particles adhered to larger particles after mixing. Based on these results, the RAM did not appear to cause host particle attrition during dry powder coating, but for certain powders, the process could promote agglomeration or further ordered mixing. The influence of RAM mixing duration was assessed using host particles mixed with 1 wt% Aerosil R972 by periodic sampling. The extent of mixing was determined indirectly from bulk-density measurements because the silicon dioxide acts as a glidant to enable host-particle rearrangement when well dispersed over the host particles. In nearly all cases, the powders achieved a steady-state bulk density after approximately five minutes of mixing (see Figure 3), and therefore a five-minute mixing time was used in subsequent host-guest particle screening experiments as the standard mixing condition. It is currently hypothesized that mixing time at resonance can be used to scale up this process. Assessment of host particles. The RAM extent of coating, as measured by the change in bulk density after 5 min of mixing, was examined using five host powders and four guest powders. The data show that, overall, the Aerosil R972 guest particles were the most effective in increasing bulk density of the host powders, followed by Aerosil A200 and magnesium stearate (see Table II). On average, titanium dioxide was the least effective for increasing bulk density. The superiority of the hydrophobic silicon dioxide over hydrophilic silicon dioxide for lowering interparticulate cohesion is consistent with reports in the literature (4, 5, 10). Similarly, magnesium stearate as a dry powder coating was also shown to be effective for increasing bulk density when mixed with sufficient mechanical shear. In fact, compared with silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate was even more effective for improving the performance of some powders when dry coated with mechanical shear, and is sensitive to processing speed and processing time (11). These results suggest that there is no universal optimal guest particle, but rather they must be individually chosen for each host and mixing system. The RAM mixing approach is well suited for this purpose as material combinations can be quickly assessed with minimal powder consumption and experimentation time. Relationship between comil and RAM dry powder coating. The bulk density and flow performance of uncoated powders were compared with comil dry coated powders and RAM dry coated powders to assess relative capabilities for dry powder coating.

In addition, the RAM was equally, if not more effective, than the comil for dry powder coating, presumably because of the significantly higher total shear strain imparted to the bulk powder system. This trend and hypothesis is similar to the observation that the comil is a more efficient tool for dry powder coating than a low-shear inversion mixer (1). Surprisingly, the relationship between flow and bulk density was linear ( R2 > 0.95) for each host particle system, regardless of the dry powder coating method. This finding further supports the qualitative observation made in comil dry coating studies in which an increase in bulk density was accompanied by an increase in flow performance (i.e., FFC) (1). Because the material consumption, material preparation time, and process time for dry powder coating with the RAM are generally lower than for an equivalent comil experiment, this instrument can be used as a screening tool during dosage form design to benchmark a host powder's maximum dry powder potential Dry Powder Coating Figure 4: Change in powder bulk density and flow performance of uncoated host particles (O), comil dry coated powders (C), and RAM dry coated powders (R).

This coating extent could then be used as a product quality attribute to target during transfer and scale-up to the comil, which is a more traditional pharmaceutical process. Conclusion The RAM was effective at applying dry powder coatings. The coated powders exhibited higher bulk density and superior powder flow performance compared with uncoated powders. This work demonstrated the following four main points: The RAM can effectively increase the bulk density of powders by applying dry powder coatings of silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate A linear relationship exists between bulk density and the FFC for powders dry coated with hydrophobic silicon dioxide Bulk density measurements can be used as a screening method to determine the potential for flow property enhancements The RAM could be used as a benchmarking tool for comil dry powder coating process optimization.

The aim was to test whether tablet hardness and weight could be controlled during the compression process by adjusting certain machine parameters. The experimental design process can help establish an understanding of the dosage-form properties of a particular compound, minimize the time required to produce a tablet with the desired characteristics, and reduce the amount of drug needed to establish the final dosage form.

Tablets have been a preferred dosage form for many decades, yet it is still challenging for formula- tion scientists to develop a robust tablet while minimizing the amount of waste created during the development process. The current study was intended to determine whether tablet hardness and weight could be controlled during the compression process with proper adjustment to certain ma- chine parameters. In this study, a Pharmatech MB015 inter- mediate bulk container (IBC) blender was used to prepare a blend consisting of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC, Avicel PH102, FMC and mag- nesium stearate (Ligamed) as a lubricant to improve flow behavior. The blend ratio of 98% MCC to 2% magnesium stearate was rotated in the asymmetrical IBC bin for 10 min at a speed of 20 rpm. Following the blending process, the powder mixture was dispensed into a hopper above a Fette (Rockaway, NJ) 102i tablet press. The 102i is a 24-station research-scale rotary tablet press capable of producing 172,800 tablets/h at its maximum rotational speed. For this set of experiments, 12 of the tablet press's stations were set up, and the selected tablet tooling produced a standard convex round tablet with a 7.5-mm diameter and a cup depth of 0.79 mm. Pretrial testing was performed to establish upper and lower limits for the variables that were determined crucial to producing a robust tablet. All testing was performed during the course of three days in a controlled environment of 70 F and 45% relative humidity. Five parameters were selected as main variables for the tableting process. The first was turret speed, for which a limit of 20,000-70,000 tablets/h was set. The turret speed, normally converted from tablets/h to rpm, is simply the ro- tational speed of the circular table in which the tablet die sits. Increases in speed increase the production rate. The second variable was feed-frame paddle speed, for which limits of 10-70 rpm were set. Tablet presses use either a gravity-fed feeder or a paddle feeder. The press used in this study incorporated a paddle feeder, which rotates several paddle wheels inside a housing where the powder blend is dispensed. The paddles sweep over the tablet dies and fill them as the paddles rotate. High speeds typically push more powder into the die cavity than low speeds do.

This variable represents how low the compression roller is set to force the tablet punches through the precompression zone to tamp down the powder and compact the blend slightly be- fore main compression occurs. Large numbers indicate that less force is applied to the powder. Tablet-cylinder height is often converted into a force measured in kilonewtons. Small values typically result in hard, thin tablets, assuming that the amount of powder fill is constant. The purpose of precompression is to remove entrapped air from the filled tablet-die cavity. This task aids the main compression step in producing a robust tablet. The fourth variable was tablet-cylinder height during main compression, for which limits of 2-3 mm were set. Like the precompression cylinder height, the main compression height is also set at a distance that directly affects the main compres- sion force applied to form the tablet. Large numbers result in soft tablets. Small values typically result in hard, thin tablets, assuming that the amount of powder fill is constant. The final variable was fill-cam height. A fixed fill cam of 12 mm was chosen for this study. The weight-adjustment ramp determines how low the lower tablet punch sits inside the die at the moment that the feed frame scrapes away the last of the excess material so that the material in the die cav- ity is level with the die table. This setting affects how much the final tablet will weigh. Large numbers result in heavy tablets. A large fill cam-weight adjustment height means that more powder will be inserted into the die, which typi- cally results in a heavy tablet. The term \"fill-cam height\" is useful for the purposes of this study simply because it is a shorter description of the weight-adjustment process step. A tablet is expected to conform to numerous require- ments, such as dissolution rate, content uniformity, friabil- ity, and thickness. Only the following two responses were selected for the current experiments: Tablet hardness (kP): For this study, a Dr. Schleuni- ger (Manchester, NH) model 8M hardness tester was selected. The tablet is set into the test zone on its flat surface while an actuated arm squeezes the tablet until it fractures. The amount of kilogram-force needed to fracture the tablet is measured and recorded. Four tab- lets were tested from each experiment, and the average value was recorded. Tablet weight (g): During each experiment, 10 tablets were weighed on a Mettler Toledo XS603-S laboratory balance, and the average value was recorded. Because each factor listed above had a wide range, the pretrial testing focused on producing a tablet with a testable hardness value. The lower limit for the selected Dr. Schleu- niger model 8M is 0.8 kp. A tablet hardness of less than 0.8 kP is too soft to hold its shape and falls apart with gentle handling. The upper limit for tablet hardness was chosen based on the maximum allowable compression force of the selected 7.5-mm round tablet tooling. Once the Fette tablet press achieved the maximum allowable force, the upper pre- compression and main compression limits were selected at a value just below that of the maximum force. Assuming excellent powder-blend flow properties, tab- let weight is primarily a function of the fill-cam size and weight-adjustment ramp setting. Fill cams are produced by the tablet press manufacturer and come in a range of sizes. The cam size is selected according to the desired tablet thickness or weight range. Fill-cam selection also can de- pend on the shape and size of the tablet being produced. For the 7.5-mm round tablet used in this study, a fixed 12-mm fill cam was selected. This selection permitted the experi- ments to test the upper and lower limits of the cam size re- quired to produce a tablet that held its shape when handled. It was determined that the weight adjustment ramp should be set to lower and upper limits of 8 and 10 mm, respectively. Experimental process and screening-study results Once pretrial experiments were completed, a broad design envelope was established using the five factors previously defined. A screening study was designed using a 251-level fractional factorial approach, which produced 16 experi- ments, as opposed to a full factorial experimental design, which would require 32 experiments. Although only 16 experiments were performed in the screening study, the fractional factorial design produces the same resolution as the full factorial design. In addition to reducing time and material, this 251 fractional factorial design tests for inter- actions between each of the five factors. For the screening study, three centerpoint experiments were added to the de- sign to test for nonlinearity (i.e., curvature in the data) and to help determine whether there was a significant lack of fit to the resulting model equation. Centerpoint experiments set all five factors to their midpoint between the low and high limits. The screening study data is shown in various tables. Table I shows the design summary, Table II shows the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for tablet hardness, and Table III shows the ANOVA for tablet weight. All experimental run data was entered into Design-Ease software (Stat-Ease) for analysis. A response ratio of 11.8485 suggests that the model should be transformed. After detailed analysis of the op- tional transformations, a square-root transformation ap- peared to present results with the highest confidence. The model F value of 509.46 implies that the model was signifi- cant. The chance that a model F value this large could occur as a result of noise is less than 0.01%. Values of p > F less than 0.0500 (at a 95% confidence interval) indicate that model terms were significant. In this case A, C, D, E, CD, and CE are significant model terms (see Table I). The curvature F value of 109.91 implies that curvature in the design space, as measured by the difference between the average of the center points and the average of the facto- rial points, was significant. The chance that a curvature F Pharmaceutical Technology OctOber 2011 107value this large could occur as a result of noise is only 0.01%. The lack-of-fit F value of 1.74 implies that the lack of fit was not significant relative to pure error, and this result is desirable. The chance that a lack-of-fit F value this large could occur as a re- sult of noise is 41.83%. The software produces equations that show how the hardness will respond when any of the factors in the equation change. R2 measures the confidence that the hardness will be what is expected. Adjusted R2 takes into account the vari- ances of the errors. For the first equa- tion, R2 is 0.9964, adjusted R2 is 0.9945, and adequate precision is 70.834. The R2 of 0.9964 is in reasonable agreement with the adjusted R2 of 0.9945. Adequate precision measures the signal-to-noise ratio. A ratio greater than 4 is desirable. The ratio of 70.834 indicates an adequate sig- nal. The following model equation, in terms of coded factors, can be used to establish the design space: [Eq. 1] The model F value of 999.17 implies the model was significant. The chance that a model F value this large could occur as a result of noise is less than 0.01%. Values of prob > F less than 0.0500 indicate that the model terms were significant. In this experiment, A, B, C, and E were significant model terms. The curvature F value of 1.16 im- plies the absence of curvature. The chance that a curvature F value this large could occur as a result of noise is 30.09% . The lack-of-fit F value of 2.17 implies that the lack of fit was not significant relative to pure error, and this result is desirable. The chance that a lack-of-fit F value this large could occur as a re- sult of noise is 35.76%. For the second equation, R2 is 0.9968, adjusted R2 is 0.9958, and ad- equate precision is 70.577.

The adequate precision ratio of 70.577 indicates an adequate signal. The following equation, in terms of coded factors, can be used to establish the design space: [Eq. 2] Augmented study approach The screening-study analysis helped determine a model equation that successfully describes the design space. The hardness and tablet weight models had R2 values close to 100%. The models were significant, with at least 95% con- fidence in the results. The centerpoint runs showed minor curvature in the design space, and an augmented experi- mental study with additional centerpoints would help de- termine its effect, since only three centerpoint runs were performed during the screening study. The screening study also showed no evidence that an upper or lower limit had been reached for the hardness or the tablet weight. An aug- mented study allows for the outer lim- its of the original screening study to be broadened to expand the factor limits and eventually aid in optimization. A central composite design (CCD) was selected for the augmented study to enable a response-surface method approach to optimization. Design- Expert software was used to prepare the augmented study factor limits and experimental run sheets. For the aug- mented study, an additional 15 runs were added to the original screening study of 19 runs, with new upper and lower limits. The 15 augmented runs included five centerpoint runs. For the 10 remaining runs that were not cen- terpoints, each factor was set at the new upper or lower limit, while the other four factors were set to their midpoints.The limits for the augmented study are shown in Table IV. Note that the coded values for some of the factors are not at a full \u00b12 as might be expected. The augmented experimental runs showed that if the limits for some of the factors were extended to two full experimental units, the resulting tablet would not have a measurable response. Modifications to the lower limits had to be made to produce valid data for subse- quent analysis. The repercussions of not using the two full experimental units are that the standard error of prediction are no longer symmetrical throughout the design space. Analysis of experimental design Hardness response. Two responses, tablet hardness and tablet weight, were measured throughout the set of experiments. Each measure response was analyzed individually. Using Design-Expert software, a half-normal plot of the experi- mental data results was constructed from the original screening results. The half-normal plot for the tablet hard- ness is shown in Figure 1. Only the significant factors are Process Development Figure 1: Half-normal plot of tablet hardness.

After the sample tablets were pulled from the rotary tablet press, the tablets were left stationary for 2 min before being tested, according to the standard protocol, as previously described. During a formal campaign, the finished batch may be held for at least 24 h before being sampled and tested again. The purpose of the delay is to ensure that the tablets did not rebound because of the compressed material's elasticity. Elastic tablets tend to expand after compression, thus causing a decrease in mea- sured tablet hardness. The half-normal plot indicates that factors A, C, D, and E, and interactions CD and CE significantly affected the hardness response. The analysis of variance shown in Table V supports the plot in Figure 1. In the next equation, R2 is 0.9881, adjusted R2 is 0.9842, and adequate precision is 56.625. The R2 of 0.9881 is in rea- sonable agreement with the adjusted R2 of 0.9842. The ad- equate precision ratio of 56.625 indicates an adequate signal, so the following model, in terms of coded factors, can be used to establish the design space: [Eq. 3] The 95% confidence intervals for all significant factors were verified to exclude zero, which supports the determina- tion that all identified terms in the model equation influence the response. A normal plot of residuals was constructed to determine whether residuals followed a normal distribu- tion (see Figure 2). A plot of residuals versus predicted was constructed to discover convincing trends to the residuals or suspected outliers in the data (see Figure 3). All data points are equally distributed and are within two standard devia- tions from the mean with two exceptions: one high point is 2.206 standard devations, and one low point is 2.312 standard deviations. The two data points that lie beyond two standard deviations of the mean could be investigated, and these experiments may warrant being rerun to confirm the data response. The data showed no potential outliers. Plots were generated for the interactions of CD and CE. The 3D-contour CD interaction plot is shaped like a spade because of the data collected during the centerpoint experi- mental runs. The interaction plot shows that tablet hardness increased as main compression and precompression heights were reduced. This makes logical sense because when the compression rollers are pulled close together, high compres- sion forces are imposed on the tablet, thus resulting in hard tablets. Both 3D plots and standard interaction plots support this analysis. The 3D contour CE interaction plot shows a response similar in shape to that of the CD interaction plot, but the shape is more easily interpreted as a channel (i.e., an inverted ridge with a slope that has not yet reached its minimum). The CE interaction plot indicates an increase in hardness when the fill-cam height (i.e., factor E) is low or high and the precompression roller height is re- duced (thus increasing compression force), as would be expected. The tablet weight responded linearly as the fill-cam height (i.e., the weight-adjustment ramp) changed. Weight response. Tablet weight is a crucial tablet character- istic, and data analysis is necessary for this response. The half-normal plot for tablet weight using the original screen- ing results indicated that factors A, B, C, and E significantly affected the weight response. The analysis of variance shown in Table VI supports the plot. In the next equation, R2 is 0.9955, adjusted R2 is 0.9945, and adequate precision is 126.423. The R2 of 0.9955 is in reason- able agreement with the adjusted R2 of 0.9945.

A normal plot of residuals was constructed to determine whether the distribution was normal. A residuals versus predicted plot was constructed to look for trends in the data. All data points are equally dis- tributed and are within two standard deviations from the mean, with two exceptions. One high point is 2.422 standard deviations, and one low point is 2.473 standard deviations). The two data points that lie beyond 2 standard deviations of the mean could be investigated, and these experiments may warrant being rerun to confirm the data response. The data have no potential outliers. No two-factor interactions can be plotted, though factor E (i.e., fill-cam height and weight-adjustment ramp) had a significant effect on tablet weight. As can be expected, the amount of powder placed into the die cavity had a direct ef- fect on tablet weight. The plot shows that as the weight ramp or fill cam height is increased, tablet weight increases. Optimization study and discussion of response Once the initial screening study and the augmented CCD study were con- cluded, sufficient data had been gener- ated to support an optimization study. The optimization process provides an opportunity to set the two responses, hardness and weight, to desirable out- comes and allow Design-Expert soft- ware to produce recommended experi- ments that should yield tablets with the desired criteria. Optimization is the ultimate goal of any experimental- design process. In this case, a target hardness of 7 kP and a weight of 190 mg were selected. The upper and lower factor limits from the augmented CCD study were used during the optimization process, and eight experiments were performed. The results of this study were mixed. Two runs were accept- able, but the other six produced undesirable hardness. The results of the optimization experiments are shown in Table VII. For added benefit, output responses from the tablet press were recorded for precompression force and main compres- sion force in kN. Although it would have been preferable to Figure 2: Normal plot of residuals for hardness. Weight = 192.7 1.14A + 17.49E 0.63B2 0.74E2Figure 3: Residuals versus predicted plot for hardness. Pharmaceutical Technology OctOber 2011 115have several more factor setpoint combinations to produce the desired tablet characteristics, several hypotheses can explain why the other experiments did not produce the desired tablet. The predicted response 3D plot shows how optimization run 7 responded at the given factor setpoints shown in Table VII. In Figure 4, a small window is evident on the concentric rings in the x axis. The window shows that a limited range of error is permis- sible to maintain the desired hardness and weight values. The area in red on the 3D contour represents the most desirable response. Further studies could be performed in the small red region with the intent of clearly defining the acceptable factor tolerances when moving a product into a manufacturing environment. High turret speeds can cause tablet weight to decrease, es- pecially if the feed-frame paddles are turning slowly. This ef- fect occurs when insufficient powder is placed into the tablet- punch die in the brief amount of time that it is under the feed frame. It is also possible that at such high radial velocities, high centrifugal forces push the powder fill out of the die.When precompression or main compression forces were high, tablet defects were observed in the form of lamination. Lamination likely occurs when the tablet is compressed too quickly, causing the tablet to separate in layers. This defect was often associated with high turret speeds. Lamination may also result from inadequate removal of the entrapped air in the die cavity during the precompression step. A tablet that has begun to laminate may provide false readings on the hardness tester. Lamination was more prevalent when main compression forces were less than precompression forces. Experienced formulation scientists and production operators understand the complexities of tablet-press operation, and this knowledge can help them to prepare targeted experimental de- signs that would produce optimization responses with great flex- ibility in the processing specification setpoints. As the processing specification setpoint error gets larger, the likelihood that the batch will be rejected for undesirable responses decreases. The larger the allowable variation from the processing setpoint, the Table VI: Analysis of variance for augmented central composite design model according to tablet weight.

Conclusion This study demonstrated that tablet hardness and weight could be controlled during the compression process with proper adjustment to certain machine parameters. Tablet compression is a complex process in solid-dosage manufac- turing. An experimental design is a useful tool, especially to the inexperienced user. Experimental design provides great insight into how all of the factors interact and what responses those interactions produce. To an experienced operator, experimental design provides a tool for generat- ing processing-specification setpoints that have large tol- erances so that manufacturing batches produce a safe and high-quality product for the patient with minimal rejection and rework. In this study, five factors were selected for all experiments, and the otherwise unknown relationships and interactions were discovered during the experimental pro- cess. As a formulator gains knowledge and experience in tablet compression, he or she can use experimental design tools such as Design-Expert with great success when the interactions between the factors are understood. High turret speeds can result in reduced tablet weight if the feed-frame paddle speed is insufficient. High speeds can also result in tablet lamination if the precompression forces are too high. In production environments, high tablet speed is most desirable because it results in high throughput. Manufacturers must strike a balance between producing ro- bust tablets and maintaining high production rates. Tablet presses normally use paddle feeders as opposed to gravity feeders. It is necessary to maintain sufficient paddle speed to ensure that the tablet die is properly filled. If the paddle speed is too high, it can overwork the formulation and cause content-uniformity failures. If the paddles pass through the blend too quickly, they can cause the constituents to separate because of their various densities. This effect may be most prominent in ungranulated direct-compression blends. In the most extreme cases, powder overworked through high-speed feed-frame paddles can be subject to shear forces, which can discolor the granulation by overheating the material. Precompression force is a measure of how much force is imparted to the tablet punch through the precompres- sion zone to tamp down the powder and slightly compact the blend before main compression. This experimental design process showed that light tamp- ing force is preferable to high precom- pression force. The goal is not to form the tablet at this step, but to remove a significant amount of air in the powder bed to minimize the potential for tablet lamination. Main compression force is similar to precompression force. Main compression rollers are often larger in diameter than precompression rollers. The larger diameter means that the tablet punch set spends a longer amount of dwell time in the main compression zone forming the tablet. Because high- speed presses have short compression zones, it is typical for a production tablet press to have large diameter compression rollers to extend the dwell time for as long as possible. To incorporate large diameter compression rollers, tablet-press manufacturers must increase the overall turret or die-table diameter to accommodate the larger compression rollers. The weight-adjustment ramp is an adjustable factor that de- pends on the fill cam that has been chosen. Fill cams are often chosen according to the size of the tablet being produced. This set- ting most directly affects how much the final tablet will weigh. For heavy tablets, it is sometimes necessary to increase feeder paddle speed to ensure that the tablet-die cavity is completely filled. Because tablet lamination was the most common defect, fur- ther studies could develop a relationship between establishing limits for precompression force and turret speed to produce tablets that are most likely to be free from this defect.

Siracusano case has raised questions among industry regarding what constitutes \"statistically significant\" information, including adverse- event reports.

But such was the situation after March 22, 2011, when the United States Supreme Court announced its decision in Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano (1, 2). In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court held that the lack of a statistically significant association between Matrixx's product Zicam and reports of adverse-drug events could not be used as jus- tification to withhold important information from stockholders. The pharmaceutical industry has questioned whether the Matrixx decision will have broader implications for drug products. The au- thors summarize the statistical and regulatory implications of the Matrixx decision on pharmaceutical quality and manufacturing. Background Matrixx is a securities-fraud class-action suit filed by investors against Matrixx Initiatives, Inc., a pharmaceutical company head- quartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, and three of the company's ex- ecutives, for violating federal securities laws by failing to disclose reports of a potential link between its leading product, Zicam Cold Remedy, and anosmia (i.e., loss of smell) (3). The investors alleged that Matrixx's past statements to the market, in which the company predicted revenue increases between 50 and 80%, were misleading in light of information available to Matrixx regarding the risk to its main revenue-generating product (4). While provid- ing optimistic sales estimates, Matrixx allegedly failed to disclose adverse-event reports regarding consumers who had lost their sense of smell after using Zicam Cold Remedy (5). Procedural history. On Dec. 15, 2005, the US District Court for the District of Arizona granted Matrixx's motion to dismiss the suit based on the investors' failure to properly plead the elements of a \"material misstatement or omission\" and knowledge of wrongdo- ing (6). In reaching this decision, the District Court relied in part on a ruling made by the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals in the case In re Carter-Wallace, Inc. (7). The In re Carter-Wallace deci- sion affirmed the dismissal of a securities-fraud class action suit based upon the investors' failure to sufficiently allege knowledge of wrongdoing on the part of the pharmaceutical company due to the absence of a statistically significant connection between the targeted drug and aplastic anemia (8). Seizing on the language in In re Carter-Wallace , the District Court in Matrixx noted that, \"courts have found adverse informa-The Matrixx Zicam Verdict Regulatory and Statistical Implications Cathy Burgess, Sean Simmons, and Lynn D. TorbeckPharmaceutical Technology OctOber 2011 119tion related to the safety of a product is not material unless such reports provide reliable statistically significant information that a drug is unsafe\" (9). In September 2003, a study conducted by the University of Colorado School of Medicine identified 11 Zicam users who suffered from anosmia (10). According to the inves- tors in Matrixx , not only did the pharmaceutical company fail to disclose the University of Colorado study, but it continued to make positive public statements regarding the product's growth potential and safety (11). Nonetheless, the District Court held that the investors \"failed to present evidence of a statistically signifi- cant correlation between the use of Zicam and anosmia so as to make failure to publically disclose complaints and the University of Colorado study a material omission\" (12). The US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, however, reversed the District Court's decision in favor of the investors, stating that the District Court erred in requiring statistical significance to estab- lish materiality (13). Relying on the Supreme Court's rulings in Basic Inc. v. Levinson and TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., the Circuit Court rejected the \"bright-line\" rule (i.e., a simple or straightforward judicial rule of decision) to determine materiality in favor of fact-specific inquiry in which an omission is material \"if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote\" (14-16). Thus, based on the factual allegations, the Circuit Court held the investors had sufficiently pleaded materiality to survive Ma- trixx's motion to dismiss (17). Thereafter, Matrixx filed a petition for certiorari , which was granted by the US Supreme Court. The court's decision From the outset, the US Supreme Court made clear that the issue at stake was: \"Whether a plaintiff can state a claim for securities fraud ... based on a pharmaceutical company's failure to disclose reports of adverse events associated with a product if the reports do not disclose a statistically significant number of adverse events\" (18). The short answer provided by the Supreme Court was clear and unanimous: yes. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Ninth Circuit in finding that the bright-line materiality rule sought by Matrixx was inconsistent with its ruling in Basic (19). The Supreme Court noted that because multiple factors are con- sidered in determining causation, the bright-line rule that 'would oth- erwise be considered significant to the trading decision of a reason- able investor'\" (20). Thus, Matrixx's argument in favor of statistical significance as the only reliable indication of causation was deemed flawed (21). After citing a litany of circumstances under which causation is determined in the absence of statistically significant data using other evidence, the Supreme Court held that \"assessing the materiality of adverse event reports is a 'fact-specific' inquiry ... that requires consideration of the source, content, and context of the reports.\" This is not to say that statistical significance (or the lack thereof) is irrelevant\u2014only that it is not dipositive of every case (22). Consequently, the Supreme Court, citing its ruling in Basic , which in turn relied on the language of the TSC Industries decision, held that because (taking the investors' allegations as true) information provided to Matrixx revealed a plausible causal relationship between Zicam Cold Remedy and anosmia, it was \"substantially likely that a reasonable investor would have viewed this information as having significantly altered the 'total mix' of information made available\" (23). Statistical significance Statistical discussions are exacting and circumscribed because the field of statistics uses the language of mathematics as well as Eng- lish to define, describe, and present statistical concepts and results. Words that are used freely in a lay discussion take on mathemati- cally precise meanings. Sentences are worded carefully to present the statistical concepts correctly. Generally, this does not present a problem because the context usually reveals whether the discus- sion is technical or not. In the both the Basic and Matrixx cases, it was clear that the discussions were not statistically oriented, and that the word \"significant\" was used in the general sense. In the Carter-Wallace case, it is clear that the discussion is sta- tistical in nature, and the word \"significant\" is used in its statistical technical sense. Thus, there is a need for a definition of the term \"statistical significance.\" Statistical analysis provides scientists with a tool along with theory and common sense for making scientific interpretations and conclusions. Often, the analysis focuses on identifying sig- nificant differences, that is, practical and statistical differences. Practical significance comes from comparing an observed dif- ference (i.e., a signal) with an absolute reference. Practical sig- nificance always takes precedence over statistical significance. In fact, statistical significance should not be determined until practical significance is found. Statistical significance, on the other hand, comes from compar- ing an observed difference with a relative reference that incorpo- rates a noise or random variability. Statistical significance testing compares a signal with noise and is often expressed as a ratio of signal to noise. The result is not meant to be a statement of causal- ity, truth, or reality. That is because if the signal can be shown to be stronger than the noise (i.e., more of a difference than expected by chance variation alone), then the scientist may conclude it to be \"statistically significant.\" Otherwise, it cannot be shown to be significant. If more data are obtained, the noise could be reduced, perhaps helping to demonstrate that the signal is significant. In fact, if the noise is small enough or if the sample is large enough, even wildly anomalous differences can be shown to be statistically significant. This difference is the reason that significance cannot be a single \"bright-line\" rule for causality. Rather, the primary purpose of statistical testing is to prevent the declaration of an ap- parent practical significance when, in fact, it could be caused by random variation. Implications for the pharmaceutical industry The Supreme Court's discussions of \"bright-line\" decision rules and the \"total mix\"of information applies to the use of statistical analysis of quality assurance and manufacturing data. Without too much difficulty, the Supreme Court's position could apply equally to stability studies, assay validation, process validation, design space, and process capability.120 Pharmaceutical Technology OctOber 2011 PharmTech.comAnyone who has hosted an FDA inspection knows that an investigator need not wait for a control chart to exceed one or more of the classic \"out-of-control\" signals before beginning a review of suspicious current and historical data. Sampling-plan acceptance should not be used as a defense for accepting some lots when it is clear from all the available information that the defect rate is higher than desired for the process as a whole. Waiting for a statistically significant event before evaluating a trend simply pushes the problem down the road; such an approach is also inconsistent with the concept of quality by design. Manufacturers should be looking at the total mix of infor- mation throughout process design, process qualification, and process verification. FDA's guidance for industry on Process Vali- dation: General Principles and Practices , issued in January 2011, makes clear that understanding the manufacturing process and potential variations\u2014that is, the total mix of information\u2014is es- sential for product quality. Interestingly, the FDA process-valida- tion guidance makes no mention of statistical significance. The document does refer to statistical confidence several times, but only in a general sense. It does not suggest or require a specific confidence level. As stated above, statistical significance is only the determi- nation that the difference we observe is larger than we would expect by random chance alone given the available estimate of variability. It is not necessarily truth, fact, or causation. It is only one tool for understanding all of the available information. FDA expects pharmaceutical manufacturers to use science-based rea- soning to determine which tools are appropriate for evaluating any given issue. In the laboratory . An out-of-specification (OOS) determina- tion is the result of comparing a single reportable value col- lected at a specific point in time with a specification. Statistical significance has no role in this determination, nor does practi- cal significance. A reportable result is either within specifica- tion or OOS. Thus, the Matrixx case has little or no implication for OOS determinations. A determination of out-of-trend (OOT) is the result of com- paring one or more reportable results collected over a time period with a statistically defined model or to statistically summarize those historical data. If a trend is large enough to be of practi- cal importance to an experienced analyst, then data should be reviewed even if they do not rise to the level of statistical sig- nificance. If the data are statistically significant, then chance is ruled out and a cause-and-effect relationship is supported but not proven. This position is supported by Matrixx , in that a lack of statistical significance does not justify failing to investigate a change in the data that could be of practical importance. Statisti- cal significance cannot be used, to quote the Supreme Court, as a single \"bright-line\" decision rule to the exclusion of other sources of supporting information. The evalua- tion of OOT data must be an evaluation of the \"total mix\" of information. Product liability lawsuits. Given that the underlying facts in Matrixx relate to ad- verse drug events, it is reasonable to ask whether the Supreme Court's decision has any bearing on product liability law- suits. Although the case does not appear to change the Supreme Court's view of the standard for causation (i.e., that the product \"more likely than not\" caused the injury, and that statistical significance is not necessary to prove such a claim), it does seem to reinforce the Supreme Court's holding in an earlier decision, Wyeth v. Levine , regarding a drug manu- facturer's responsibility to act upon new information about adverse events (24). In Wyeth , the Plaintiff, Diana Levine, claimed that she was injured by the in- appropriate administration of Wyeth's antinausea drug Phenergan, which caused her to develop gangrene and resulted in the amputation of a portion of her arm. In this case, a Vermont jury found that the Phenergan label was in- adequate and should have contained a stronger warning regarding intravenous push administration because of the Statistics OUT& Impact Analytical is a contract testing laboratory providing comprehensive analytical testing.

Wyeth maintained that Levine's state tort claims were preempted because FDA had approved the Phenergan label without such a strong warning (25). The doctrine of federal preemption is based upon the Suprem- acy Clause in the Constitution, which states that the \"Constitu- tion and the laws of the United States ... shall be the supreme law of the land [notwithstanding] anything in the constitutions or laws of any state . ...\" (26). Federal law preempts state law where a federal statute contains specific language indicating that federal law must control (express preemption), where federal law \"occu- pies the field\" (i.e., field preemption) or where state law conflicts with federal law and thus making it impossible to comply with both (i.e., conflict preemption). Wyeth argued that it would have been impossible for it to modify its labeling without violating federal law and that allow- ing Levine's state tort claim was unacceptable because it would permit a state jury to override FDA's scientific judgment regard- ing a product's labeling (27, 28). The Supreme Court rejected Wy- eth's arguments, holding that state tort claims for injuries caused by drug products were not preempted by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and that drug manufacturers have primary responsibility for strengthening warnings in their labeling based on new information about adverse events. The Supreme Court reasoned that Wyeth could have strengthened the warnings on the Phenergan label without prior FDA approval, and added that Wyeth could not simply rely on its approved labeling when faced with new information of adverse events (29, 30). The Supreme Court noted that FDA does not have sufficient resources of its own to enforce drug-product safety. FDA has historically viewed state tort law as a supplementary form of drug product regulation. Ultimately, however, the responsibility for safety of the product resides with the manufacturer (31). Conclusion The Wyeth decision put drug manufacturers on notice that they bear primary responsibility for their labeling, and they must be vigilant in monitoring and evaluating adverse events associated with their drug products. Moreover, the evaluation of risk in- formation must be ongoing: an event that seems insignificant today may be quite significant a year from now, in light of other adverse events. As shown in Matrixx , courts may not look solely to the concept of statistical significance in order to determine whether or not such adverse events indicate causation. Instead, as reaffirmed by the Supreme Court, drug manufacturers must continue to evaluate multiple sources of information when as- sessing the risks associated with their products. While the Matrixx case made no mention of Wyeth , it seems that the two cases are consistent in requiring drug manufacturers to evaluate carefully any new information about a drug product that trigger an obligation to act\u2014whether to notify stockholders of material facts or to change the warnings on a product's label- ing. However, such cases merely illustrate that the courts, investors and federal and state governments expect this obligation to extend well beyond mitigation of litigation risks and instead to include every aspect of pharmaceutical product design, manufacture, and stewardship.

The authors outline some areas that would benefit from additional consideration and the development of harmonization. These areas include step-wise modifications of test products, the concept of \"representative,\" genotoxic impurities, specifications and acceptance criteria, and stability studies. Steve Allen / Getty ImAGeSClinical-Trial Materials Conducting clinical trials is an integral part in develop- ing new, safe, and efficacious pharmaceutical prod- ucts. Exposing study volunteers to an experimental drug, particularly in the early stages of development, is challenging because of the limited information on the functional performance of the drug candidate. Regulatory guidances and formal control and approval procedures are in place to reduce risks and safety threats to study volun- teers. This article discusses the management of risks in pharmaceutical quality of clinical-trial supplies, particularly the challenges that occur for early-stage clinical trial materi- als for which knowledge of the drug compound is limited. The basic dilemma that seems difficult to fully circumvent is that one is gaining knowledge about the importance of quality attributes through the development process, yet the application of GMPs is predicated on that knowledge. The authors examine this dilemma and resolution in several areas: step-wise modifications of test products, the concept of \"representative,\" genotoxic impurities, specifications and acceptance criteria, and stability studies. Basic dilemma The principles that ensure that modern pharmaceutical products are produced to be safe and efficacious are codi- fied in cGMPs. In the US, these requirements are set forth in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act , specifically in Section 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 210 and 211 (1-3). In Europe, cGMPs are specified in Eudralex Volume 4, and similar standards exist in most countries (4). In large part, existing regulations do not distinguish between clinical supplies and approved commercial prod- ucts. One notable, but limited exception, is FDA's approach to certain Phase I clinical supplies. In 2008, FDA finalized a rule exempting certain Phase I clinical supplies from Section 21 CFR Part 211 and simulta- neously issued a guidance describing cGMP expectations for these clinical drug products (5). Although the guidance relaxes some expectations for clinical supplies compared with those for approved commercial products, the guidance requires most of the quality systems and components described in Section 21 CFR Part 211, including those for validated test procedures, specifications with acceptance criteria, and stability studies Quality Issues for Multiregional Clinical-Trial Materials Dennis Sandell, Terrence Tougas, Dennis O'Connor, and Steve Horhota Dennis Sandell* is director of S5 Consulting, J\u00e4rn\u00e5krav\u00e4gen 3, Se-222 25, lund Sweden, tel. + 46 46 150703, dennis@s5consulting.com.

This situation creates a dilemma for industry and regulators: one is still gaining knowledge about quality attributes during de- velopment, but application of cGMPs is based on the knowledge that is being acquired. More uncertainty about what is important to quality exists in early development compared with later in de- velopment as a product design matures and moves to commercial approval. This knowledge gap means that it is impossible to imple- ment the same level of cGMPs at Phase Ia as compared with a commercial drug product. Although authorities generally do not expect the same level of cGMPs throughout development, there is little specific regu- latory guidance on expectations for early development or for the various stages of development. As a result, International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidances on quality and other guidelines that are designed for commercial products are applied unevenly and unpredictably to early-development clinical trial materials because the consideration of quality var- ies from reviewer to reviewer and company to company. This inconsistency affects issues relating to specifications, shelf-life and stability, starting materials and the description of an API synthesis, and potential impurities. Specifications . Formal specifications are required for the release of clinical-drug products and related materials, yet the complete relevant knowledge for establishing meaningful specifications will not exist in the early-development stages, including infor- mation needed for selecting tests and the associated acceptance criteria. Some examples include tests for metal catalysts used early in an API synthesis, requirements for residual solvents, and dissolution requirements for solid oral formulations. Shelf-life and stability . Establishing an initial shelf-life for clini- cal supply requires extrapolation from a previous representative batch based primarily on limited accelerated testing. Adhering strictly to the ICH stability expectations for establishing and extending shelf-life would be a serious impediment to product development. Again, little guidance exists concerning a practi- cal approach to establishing the initial shelf-life of a prototype product that is likely to undergo significant refinements before a mature product design is achieved. Although most regulators expect concurrent stability studies to be conducted on repre- sentative samples of the clinical-trial material, this testing is of limited value with respect to ensuring the quality of the batch and frequently is of little value to the developer. Starting materials and description of the API synthesis. A commer- cial API synthesis is, in part, defined by the regulatory approval of designated starting materials. This designation has signifi- cant implications because it provides a detailed disclosure of the synthesis process and defines where cGMPs apply. Agreement on starting materials typically occurs before the manufacture of registration batches and is based on a detailed understand- ing of the factors that influence API quality, in particular the impurity profile. At the early stages in process development of an API synthe- sis, there is no regulatory approved starting material designa- tion, and there is a limited amount of information regarding the source or even the absolute identity of impurities appearing or potentially present in the final API. In addition, the route of syn- thesis is changing and evolving as the requirements shift from laboratory-scale quantities to a commercially viable synthesis. The net result is vague regulatory expectations regarding the level of detail and the extent of disclosure of the chemical steps leading to the final API. As a result, there are often additional requests by regulatory authorities that result in further expen- diture of resources by the applicant and regulatory authority or potential delays of clinical trials. Potential impurities . Although the concept of an actual im- purity is reasonably well-defined in ICH Q3A (R2) Impuri- ties in New Drug Substances, the concept of what constitutes a potential impurity is not (6). Decisions on designation of potential impurities, including degradation products, drive many activities and issues for the API and drug product. These decisions include the development of analytical procedures, the designation of API starting materials, the development of the API synthesis, the description of the synthesis, formulation development, and the design of sta- bility protocols. Additionally, any process designating po- tential impurities must consider the level of concern. Recent emphasis on genotoxic impurities complicates the issue be- cause one must consider whether a particular compound is potentially genotoxic and whether it is present at levels of concern, which are typically in the parts-per-million range.

The concept of \"representative\" A key concept of the pharmaceutical industry for introduc- ing change is an assumption that some entity is representa- tive of future materials produced by a proposed process. For example, the registration of a commercial product includes some number of so-called registration batches of API and drug product that are intended to be equivalent in quality and representative of the future quality of the commercial product. An application for a change to an approved com- mercial process typically includes a collection of analytical results from the product considered to be representative of future production, together with appropriate statistical com- parison to the existing product. The term representative does not equate with identical . For example, registration batches may be produced at pilot scale rather than at full produc- tion scale and still are considered to be representative of the commercial-scale process. For late-stage and commercial scenarios, ICH Q1A (R2) S tability Testing of New Drug Sub- stances defines what can be considered representative (7). During all phases of development, this same strategy of using representative materials to justify change, justify re- duced stability studies and establish initial shelf-life or extend shelf-life is frequently used and can be a valid and efficient development tool. As change is inherent in development, the ability to use representative materials to initially predict future performance is essential. The same criteria that define repre- sentative for a commercial process, however, are not transfer- able to early development. Again, the lack of regulatory guid- ance or established industrywide best practices relevant to development leads to unpredictable or uneven acceptance of the use of representative materials by regulatory authorities. There is a clear benefit to develop such best practices and/or regulatory guidance that defines the concept of representative by stage of development. Genotoxic impurities Compounds that have been shown to induce genetic mutations, chromosomal breaks, and/or chromosomal rearrangements are considered genotoxic and have the potential to cause cancer in humans. Regulatory authorities consider that exposures to even low levels of these impurities may be of significant concern. Current guidances that address issues related to impurities in- clude ICH Q3A (R2) Impurities for New Drug Substances and Q3B (R2) Impurities in New Drug Products, and EMA's Com- mittee for Medicinal Products for Human Use's guideline on the limits of genotoxic impurities (GTIs) (6, 8, 9). The ICH guidances define an impurity as any component of the drug substance or drug product other than the chemi- cal entity that makes up the drug substance or an excipient in the drug product. Depending on the quantity of drug substance or drug product to which a patient is exposed, these guidances recommend thresholds for the identifica- tion, reporting, and qualification of impurities. The iden- tification limits provided in ICH Q3A (R2) and ICH Q3B (R2), however, may not be acceptable for genotoxic or car- cinogenic impurities. The EMA guideline recommends that the level for GTIs should be \"as low as reasonably practicable\" (ALARP). Accord- ing to this principle, manufacturers should strive to achieve the lowest levels of genotoxic or carcinogenic impurities that are technically feasible and/or levels that convey no significant can- cer risk. For example, alternative synthetic routes that do not lead to genotoxic residues should be used if practical. However, according to EMA, the ALARP principle does not need to be applied to impurities that do not exceed the threshold of toxi- cological concern (TTC) (10). The ICH guidances on impurities do not apply to drug sub- stances or drug products used during the clinical research. Issues regarding the presence of genotoxic or carcinogenic im- purities, however, often occur during clinical development. In cases where the presence of an impurity with genotoxic or carci- nogenic potential is identified or where such an impurity may be expected based on the synthetic pathway, steps should be taken during the clinical development to address safety concerns as- sociated with these impurities. The EMA guideline provides recommendations for acceptable exposure thresholds during clinical development as well as for marketing applications. The concept of TTC for genotoxic compounds was de- Technical ServicesDevelopment Sciences Clinical Manufacturing Product Design Formulation Development Design Space Studies Process Engineering Thermal AnalysisClinical Material Preparation Technical ServicesQuality / Regulatory Support On-site Training Consulting 30 INDIAN DRIVE LuNPR IVYLAND, PA 18974 128 Pharmaceutical Technology OctOber 2011 PharmTech.comveloped for the EMA guideline and a draft FDA guideline, Genotoxic and Carcinogenic Impurities in Drug Substances and Products: Recommended Approaches (9-11). The guide- lines stipulate that exposure to a GTI must be below 1.5 /uni03BCg/ day, which represents a 1 in 100,000 incremental lifetime cancer risk. This level does not apply to the most potent car- cinogens or to GTIs for which safe limits already exist based on evidence of a threshold mechanism for genotoxicity. The TTC comes from an analysis of 730 compounds and related carcinogenicity data in the Carcinogenic Potency Database housed at the University of California, Berkeley (12). Origi- nally proposed by regulators as a 0.15-/uni03BCg limit on carcino- genic impurities in food, the value was adjusted upward for pharmaceuticals because of the benefit gained from taking medications. Even so, the 1.5 /uni03BCg limit is about 1000 times lower than typical thresholds on impurities. Alternatives to the TTC approach may be used. If there are adequate safety data for a known GTI, the data can be used to set limits that may differ from the TTC. Lacking data, drug developers have the option to conduct toxicological studies with a GTI to enable an estimation of a compound-specific limit or to default to the TTC. With impurities suspected to be GTIs, drug developers may not bother to classify them depending on the expected risk, needed analytical efforts, and considerations for controlling the impurity. If no testing is done, potential GTIs must be controlled at or below the TTC. If testing finds that a potential GTI is genotoxic, either the TTC or a level based on safety data must be used. If it is not genotoxic, the impurity is handled like any impurity. Although avoidance of GTIs as reagents, starting materials, synthetic intermediates, and byproducts in chemical process- ing is an important consideration, it is not always feasible or desirable. Functional groups that render starting materials and synthetic intermediates useful as reactive building blocks may also be responsible for their genotoxicity. Avoidance of mesyl- ate or tosylate salt isolations (i.e., to avoid potential mesylate and tosylate ester GTIs) may limit opportunities for optimal purification, physical properties, stability, or bioavailability of an API. The alternative to avoiding GTIs is to assess and man- age potential risk through appropriate application of chemical process design and analytical testing. The timing for GTI assessment and testing also must be con- sidered. During the early phases of development leading up to and including initial clinical trials, drug-candidate attrition is significant. Adding to the challenge of addressing GTIs is the fact that the chemical synthesis may be rapidly changing as it progresses toward a commercial synthetic route. Taking into account the limited availability of information on the impurity profile, especially in early development, and in the likelihood that the route of synthesis may change in the course of process optimization, a staged evaluation of reasonably expected GTIs or potential genotoxic impurities (pGTI) should be performed throughout development.

See us at AAPS, Booth 2355Pharmaceutical Technology OctOber 2011 129based on clinical stage of development, dose, and duration of administration (13). The draft FDA guidance also proposes a staged TTC approach, however, at stricter levels as compared with the PhRMA white paper (11, 13). Following a staged TTC approach, drugs can contain higher levels of GTIs if they are given for shorter periods of time, with the level staged to the duration of exposure. For pharmaceutical companies, the staged TTC greatly eases the burden on characterizing and controlling impuri- ties during the drug-development process. In early-stage work, impurity information is limited, and analytical methods are undeveloped. As candidates advance and synthetic processes are optimized, impurities are routinely assessed, and plans are made for avoiding or controlling them. A risk assessment of the synthetic process, including starting materials, intermediates, solvents, byproducts, and impurities identifies GTIs that are or might be present. Regulatory agencies may accept in silico structure-activity relationship (SAR) methods instead of laboratory tests to con- clude that the impurity is not genotoxic even if it has an alert- ing structure. Using in silico evaluations and expert opinion, GTI alert structures are identified among the compounds for which no data are available. Examples of commercial software applications used for this purpose include Casetox (Multi- CASE and Derek (Network Sciences Corp.) (14, 15). Certain chemical functional groups or structures associated with DNA reactivity are considered alerts for genotoxicity. If an impurity has a structural alert, a bacterial mutagen- esis screen, such as the Ames test, can be run to confirm its genotoxicity. A negative Ames test result will overrule a structural alert, and the impurity can be considered nongenotoxic. Although seemingly clearcut, pGTI evaluations have become a significant issue because there is no standard, agreed-upon process as to how to do an SAR evaluation. Some European regulatory agencies do not use any in silico methods because the systems are too costly to run and maintain. These agencies rely instead on simple struc- tural alerts. On the other hand, FDA has multiple systems, some of which are proprietary and inaccessible to drug developers. Although this staged approach provides significant clarity to con- trolling pGTIs, there are still several areas where further guidance would be beneficial. These areas are the use of scientific justification in lieu of actual testing for pGTIs, the scope of search for pGTIs in the synthetic scheme (i.e., raw materials, intermediates, byproducts, the synthetic steps before the final drug substance), testing methodology, and level of validation of these methods. An online PhRMA survey was created to serve as a bench- mark of industry standards and practices regarding genotoxic impurities (16, 17). The survey was sent to 22 different pharma- ceutical companies with 15 companies responding to the survey. Some key results included: 85% of respondents said they evaluate the synthetic pro- cess for pGTIs at the preclinical stage. 74% of respondents develop analytical test methods for all identified pGTIs. 82% of respondents stated they control pGTIs in non- genotoxic oncology drugs. 96% of respondents that follow a risked-based assess- ment for deciding not to test for a pGTI consider the number of steps back from the final API where the pGTI originates. 91% of respondents used the staged TTC approach from the PhRMA white paper for setting specifications for pGTIs during clinical development. The most common rationale for not testing for a pGTI was consideration of where the pGTI was introduced into the syn- thesis and whether the pGTI is reactive enough to be eliminated in downstream chemistry or processing, for example, acyl chlo- rides.

In addition, due to time constraints, when a pGTI has been identified, analytical methods may have to be developed, and controls implemented before confirmation through mutagenic testing. Assessment and control of pGTIs in drug development is challenging because of the evolving nature of the synthetic process, variable points of entry of pGTIs in the process, and the need for analytical measurements with adequate selectivity and sensitivity. When applying the staged TTC approach, consideration should be given to the drug prod- uct's clinical-development stage, the maximum duration of drug administration at that stage, the proposed indication (e.g., a life-threatening condition versus a less serious con- dition), the patient population (e.g., adults versus children), and the structural similarity of an impurity to a compound of known carcinogenic potency. Establishing specifications The quality of a commercial pharmaceutical product is set by a well-designed, understood, and executed manufacturing pro- cess using high quality raw materials. This built-in quality is verified at release and on stability by random sampling and test- ing of critical product characteristics against established specifi-cations containing specific acceptance criteria per characteris- tic. A natural aim is to control the quality of an investigational pharmaceutical product in a corresponding way, but this quality control is more challenging for several reasons. In-vivo/in-vitro correlation . Ideally, one would like to know how a change in an in vitro characteristic influences a desir- able or undesirable response in vivo . Using such knowledge, together with clinical judgment about where to draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable in vivo responses, it is fairly straightforward to develop appropriate control limits for in vitro characteristics. Unfortunately, these relations often are not fully understood even for products on the market, and the likelihood of being able to develop specifications using this ap- proach is even more unlikely earlier in development. Lack of information. For a product that is close to registra- tion, several batches already have been studied in Phase I-III development. The recorded release and stability in vitro char- acteristics of successful earlier clinical batches, together with batches manufactured under similar conditions as the clinical batches, can be used as a basis for statistically established lim- its for different critical quality attributes (CQAs). However, the earlier in the development process, the more limited this pool of historical knowledge becomes, including that some of the CQAs might not have been recorded for early batches. This problem can happen by not realizing that an attribute was critical or by not having appropriate analytical methodol- ogy to make that evaluation. Change to product. A basis for developing specifications based on previous knowledge is that earlier batches are representative of recently manufactured batches or at a minimum, it is under- stood how these batches relate to each other. During develop- ment, changes to raw materials, excipients, scale, packaging, and formulation occur frequently. Some data from previous batches, therefore, may be irrelevant and difficult to interpret. Method development . Characterizing a batch of product re- quires sophisticated analytical methods, and as such, takes time to develop, optimize, and validate. Batches used during development often are characterized using different meth- ods of increasing complexity and performance. Moreover, characterization of development batches and clinical-trial material may be done using different equipment in differ- ent laboratories . In vitro data for earlier batches may not be fully comparable to the corresponding data for later batches. Subjectivity of regulatory authorities in different regions . Consider- ing all issues associated in developing specifications during the early stages of development, it often comes down to collecting all data and scientific information available, judging the value of different pieces against each other, and making the best overall subjective judgment, taking all relevant regulatory guidance into account. The fact that a subjective element is involved can cause issues for releasing clinical-trial material in different regions as the guidelines and regulators' judgment may differ from the sponsor's. As a consequence, the tightest release specification over all regions often must be used. This need to simultaneously satisfy requirements in several regions in some cases lead to un- Our Focus/emdash.capYour Success Dow can oer you the following services for the production of sterile products Ophthalmic product development Vials, & bottle /f_illing; aseptic & terminally sterilized Solutions, suspensions, emulsions, ointments & gels Drug device combinations that may require aseptic assembly and /f_illing Scale-up to pilot scale Tech transfer to CMO of choiceOur Focus Your SuccessNEW Sterile Services!

Stability studies Clinical-trial materials are by their na- ture experimental items that undergo evolution as the potential drug candidate progress through clinical development. Because they are experimental, there is a certain amount of risk originating from the relative lack of information regarding functional performance and how critical dosage form attributes might be changing over time. From the standpoint of the formula- tion scientist, two principal risk-manage- ment goals need to be achieved during a clinical trial. First, the safety of partici- pating study volunteers must be ensured by minimizing controllable safety threats. Second, if an investigational compound fails to meet clinical-study objectives, whether for efficacy or toxicological reasons, it should be from a intrinsic outcome of the compound itself and not because of a failure in performance of the dosage form. The risk-management exercise is driven by the general interest in mov- ing to human trials as soon as possible to validate a proof of concept for phar- macological activity and determine if a particular compound is worthy of fur- ther consideration. As a consequence, early-development timelines typically are short, meaning that only a limited amount of information is available on dosage-form performance as a function of time and storage conditions. The un- certainty from the lack of stability data is partially balanced by the fact that early clinical trials are short in duration, involve a small numbers of subjects, and have a high level of control over the storage and handling of the clinical-trial materials. As illustrated in Table I, when a compound moves to the next stages of clinical devel- opment, the amount of data collected on performance increases, thereby resulting in reduced uncertainty in some respects. In parallel, the length of trial, the numbers of subjects involved, and the diminished control over the test articles also are in- creasing, thereby somewhat offsetting the increased data set.The statistical tools and evaluation criteria for stability data collected at the end stages of development, especially in support of marketing authorizations, are well developed. They primarily consist of linear least-squares techniques with hy- pothesis testing on slopes to determine whether a significant change over time is occurring for critical parameters. Poola- bility of slopes and intercepts is used to determine if product characteristics are reproducible between batches. These tools are less useful at the earlier stages in development because of the lim- ited duration of available stability data. Formulations typically are undergoing rapid evolution and are produced in very limited quantities, so homogeneity across batches cannot be ensured. Opportuni- ties to use neural networks in cases such as these have been explored but have not been widely implemented (18). Other multivariate techniques, such as cluster analysis or pattern-recognition meth- ods, which capitalize on previous work with related compounds or formulations would be worthy of further exploration. Conclusion There is considerable opportunity to improve drug development without compromising the strong safeguards that mitigate risk to subjects in clini- cal trials, including, areas that would benefit from additional consideration and harmonization. Although broad regulatory requirements exist for ma- terials going into clinical trials, more defined best practices that reflect the stage of development and risk-manage- ment practices would be a benefit to industry, regulators, and patients. The vetting of such best practices should be through an open process that involves these same stakeholders. To be most ef- fective, best practices should be suffi- ciently detailed yet flexible and subject to continuous improvement. The cur- rent philosophy of regulatory agencies has been to set a general framework for regulatory expectations through formal guidance documents but not to supply the level of detailed implied herein .

The manufacture, distribution, and dis- pensation of medicines are strictly and efficiently controlled in regions such as Europe and the United States, which may explain the low number of coun- terfeiting incidents that occur in these regions compared with other areas of the world. The high confidence of the public in the pharmaceutical supply chain, however, needs to be maintained and reinforced to keep discouraging patients from purchasing medicines from illegal websites. Complex supply chains Awareness campaigns, such as those promoted by the Council of Europe, can assist in this regard. These pro- grams, among other things, direct consumers seeking online pharma- ceuticals to the legitimate supply chain. New complex channels of distribution and dispensation, however, are devel- oping. These changes, coupled with economic constraints in public health- care systems are opening the door to fraud committed by rogue players.Anticounterfeiting efforts among regulators and business stakeholders have increased in the US and Europe since 2007. During these past few years, several serious incidents of counterfeit- ing, contamination, and adulteration have occurred, affecting, among oth- ers, Plavix, Casodex, and Zyprexa in the UK, and heparin worldwide. A European mass- serialization strategy The Council of Europe and its Euro- pean Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare (EDQM) have developed a comprehensive an- ticounterfeiting strategy that includes several activities, including the train- ing of customs, police and health offi- cers and the adoption of the Medicrime Convention on counterfeiting of medi- cal products and similar crimes involv- ing threats to public health. The Med- icrime Convention will be opened for signatures this month (October 2011), and will constitute, for the first time, a binding international legal instrument to combat counterfeiting by criminal- izing these activities (1). As part of this anticounterfeiting strategy, a new EDQM project called eTACT aims to develop a traceabil- ity and mass-serialization system that authorities and stakeholders (i.e., manufacturers, suppliers, dis- tributors, healthcare professionals, patients) across the global pharmaceu- tical supply chain can use. At its current stage of development, eTACT consists of a live demonstration IT system, developed using nonpropri- etary standards, with inherent flex- ibility. The system's repositories will contain data on the pharmaceutical products and items traced (e.g., trans- action data, such as the commissioning and registration of new items, packing, shipping, and dispensing). The main standards followed will be those from GS1, the international nonprofit association dedicated to im- proving the efficiency and visibility of supply chains. Product identifiers will thus be the GS1 Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs) and also national product numbers, such as VNRs in the Nordic countries. Master data (i.e., the product name, marketing au- thorization holder, dose strength) will be registered together with these prod- uct number(s). The item data will be formed by combining the product number(s), a nonsequential and unpredictable se- rial number, the batch number, and the expiry date of the item. The result- ing unique number, a Unique Medicine Europe establishes new collaborative system to track products and protect pharmaceutical supply chain.Susanne KeitelMass Serialization Program to Combat Counterfeit Drugs Susanne Keitel is director of the european Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and Healthcare (eDQM) of the council of europe in strasbourg, France. eDQM is responsible for the european Pharmacopoeia (Ph.eur.) , susanne.Keitel@edqm.eu. Allowing patients to verify the authenticity of their medication is a unique feature of EDQM's project.134 Pharmaceutical Technology OctOber 2011 PharmTech.comInside EDQM Identifier (UMI), compliant with GS1 standards, will be placed on the sec- ondary packaging of medicinal prod- ucts in the form of a 2D Datamatrix barcode. A switch to RFID tags is pos- sible at a later stage when the technol- ogy for this data carrier is sufficiently mature. Transaction data will be registered by system administrators. What data is recorded, who has access to those data and under what circumstances (e.g., alerts, or recalls) will be decided upfront by the stakeholders depending on the market destination of the prod- ucts, the panEuropean architecture of the system, and the data-sharing op- tion chosen by the manufacturer. The IT system will be usable along the entire pharmaceutical supply chain to the patient level to prevent entry of the counterfeit products into the mar- ketplace. The system will allow verifi- cation of any individual item or pack- age of a medicinal product by querying the directory of the repositories. System benefits Allowing patients to verify the authen- ticity of their medication is a unique feature of EDQM's project that will sig- nificantly contribute to strengthening the public's confidence in the legal sup- ply chain. Access for patients will be limited to verification and, given that their credentials will not be checked for privacy reasons, the level of informa- tion disclosed to them will be limited compared with that given to registered authorities and business stakeholders. (Figure 1 provides an overview of the eTACT service.) For products and countries where the system will be used, UMI scanning will be mandatory for manufacturers supplying, and for pharmacies veri- fying, pharmaceutical products. As a result, a minimum amount of informa- tion is always available for verification (i.e., that the item exists, is genuine, and has been dispensed only once by a registered pharmacy). Other business stakeholders in the supply chain between manufacturers and pharmacies may not be suitably equipped, or may not be willing to use the system systematically for cost rea- sons or because of high logistical con- straints, such as speed of distribution (the efficient pharmaceutical distribu- tion system is an asset to be preserved). For them, querying the UMI or captur- ing other transaction data (e.g., pack- ing and shipping) will be optional. This strategy makes the system pro- posed by the EDQM different from a pedigree or track-and-trace system, as is proposed in California, where any transfer of a pack from one party to another within the supply chain must be recorded, a step that represents a large business constraint. The eTACT system will rely on a central EDQM repository, supported by decentralized repositories among the manufacturers or with national bodies in an information-sharing model. Existing national systems will remain in place. The flexibility of this approach is a prerequisite for dealing with the key challenge of interoperability and for preparing for the complex implementa- tion of future European requirements for the traceability of medicinal prod-ucts, as defined by the recently adopted European Union Falsified Medicines Directive 2011/62 and its future del- egated acts (2). Conclusion By providing business stakeholders and regulators with a flexible pan- European system, the EDQM eTACT project allows for a harmonized, stan- dardized, and centralized securitiza- tion of the legitimate pharmaceutical supply chain, whatever the distribu- tion route. The system extends to the legitimate Internet sales of medicines promoted in some European countries. Public governance of such a system is vital to ensure effective and proper project development in coordination with regulatory authorities and to prevent the misuse of data (e.g., com- mercial data or information to patients on products).

The Importance of PIC/S in a Globalized World Tor Gr\u00e5berg The Pharmaceutical Inspection Coop- eration Scheme (PIC/S) celebrated its 40th anniversary in Geneva this past May. PIC/S has been a pioneer organiza- tion in the field of pharmaceutical in- spections and GMP. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention (PIC) entered into force in May 1971, as the first ever mutual recognition agreement (MRA) in the field of GMP inspections. Changing times Today, the organization has grown from 10 original European country members to 39 participating authorities from five continents. An additional nine authori- ties from countries such as Brazil and Indonesia, are in the process of becom- ing members. Paradoxically, the growth of the organization has been made pos- sible by moving from a legally-binding MRA (PIC) to an informal arrangement between regulatory authorities that better facilitates cross-border trade of pharmaceuticals while ensuring the safety of patients. Members exchange GMP information such as inspection reports, recall alerts, and other relevant data on a voluntary basis. PIC/S has adopted other goals as well, including the development and har- monization of GMP standards and guid- ance documents, the training of compe-tent authorities, in particular inspectors, the assessment (and reassessment) of in- spectorates, and the facilitation of coop- eration and networking for competent au- thorities and international organizations in view of promoting mutual confidence. The expansion of the PIC/S mis- sion illustrates how successfully the or- ganization has been able to adapt to a constantly changing environment\u2014in particular, globalization. The increas- ing globalization of public-health issues and the multiplication of actors involved (both in industry and among regulatory authorities) has made it necessary to in- crease harmonization efforts in setting regulatory requirements, inspecting and evaluating GMP compliance, licensing manufacturing sites, recalling defective batches, and the exchange of informa- tion. The philosophy of PIC/S is based on cooperation, communication, and trust. Because information-sharing within PIC/S is voluntary, it is up to the receiver of the information to decide how to use it (e.g., a participating authority can use the outcome of an inspection conducted by another PIC/S authority to avoid duplicat- ing an inspection). FDA's membership FDA has acknowledged PIC/S' efforts. The agency applied for PIC/S member- ship a few years ago and became an offical member in January 2011. PIC/S invited FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, MD, to deliver a kenote ad- dress at the May 2011 anniversary cel- ebration (1). In this address, Hamburg called upon all regulatory authorities to cooperate more closely and to share information on GMP inspections. Due to the globalization of the supply chain, a growing part of finished products and APIs are imported. Globalization represents not only new opportunities for manufacturers but also considerable challenges for regulators. As Hamburg as- serted, \"...no one country is capable of in- specting the world on its own, nor can we assure quality with inspections alone\" (1). All PIC/S members, including FDA, need to think about how to best pool resources and work together to protect public health. For FDA, PIC/S represents a key way to avoid the duplication of ef- forts and ensure the global security of the supply chain. Hamburg concluded her speech by saying, \"Today, PIC/S is more important than ever, given the realities of globalization\" (1). The FDA Commissioner's speech is remarkable on at least two counts: As Hamburg underlined\u2014and this is also valid for other countries, \"In the US, a stunning 80% of the ac- tive pharmaceutical ingredients in our drugs come from outside our borders and about 40% of the fin- ished drugs themselves\" (1). Because neither the US nor any other regula- tory authorities can inspect all im- ported medicinal products (includ- ing APIs), cooperation with other authorities is vital to get the most possible amount of information that a single regulatory agency's inspec- tors cannot gather. FDA is willing to use PIC/S as a tool to better safeguard the health of Americans.

Notewor- thy deals are INC Research's acquisi- tion of Kendle International, which boosted INC in rev- enues; inVentiv's purchase which pushed Catalent into the number two slot in clinical packaging. The rationale cited for these mega- deals is that global bio/pharmaceutical companies favor large CROs with broad capabilities in their selection of pre- ferred service providers. These \"stra- tegic partnership\" deals are the cor- nerstone of global bio/pharmaceutical companies' current sourcing strategies, which seek to leverage their massive buying power while reducing sourcing overhead expense and improving coor- dination with the CRO. The list of publicly announced pre- ferred provider deals (see Table I) shows that global bio/pharmaceutical com- panies have clearly embraced the large multiservice provider, at least for now. However, there is a substantial probability that sourcing models will change signifi-cantly in coming years and threaten the business model upon which the recent megadeals are based. sourcing strategies We have already seen a major shift in sourcing strategies at one of the largest bio/pharmaceutical companies. Pfizer was an early proponent of the func- tional service provider (FSP) sourcing model but has now shifted to the in- tegrated service provider (ISP) model. In the FSP model, Pfizer sought to en- gage the best-in-class service provider in each clinical research activity (e.g., site monitoring, data management, or central laboratory services) and to have those best-in-class providers support all of their trials. However, Pfizer exec- utives found the FSP model too costly because too much internal overhead was required to coordinate the activi- ties of the various FSPs. In its most recently announced stra- tegic CRO deals with Icon and Parexel, Pfizer has moved to the ISP model in hopes of eliminating the high internal overhead costs. Now, Icon and Parexel will provide a broad range of services to each of the clinical trials they will manage on behalf of Pfizer. coming down the learning curve It should be remembered that both the global bio/pharmaceutical companies and their CRO partners are still very new to the strategic sourcing process. They have barely begun to progress down the learning curve of how to establish and manage these relationships; the bio/ pharmaceutical industry is thought to be a decade or more behind other industries in its sourcing practices. As both sides gain experience and as some of these rela- tionships blow up, as they inevitably will, the sourcing model will evolve in direc- tions that have not yet been anticipated. At many of the global bio/ pharmaceutical companies, the senior executives that negotiated these stra-Preparing for the last War CROs that have made big acquisitions could be outmaneuvered by evolving sourcing models.Jim Miller Jim Miller is president of PharmSource Information Services, Inc., and publisher of bio/Pharmaceutical Outsourcing report , tel. 703.383.4903, fax 2009 CMC WuXi AppTec Bristol-Myers Squibb 2011 Clinical packaging Fisher Clinical Eli Parexel Pfizer 2011 Icon, Parexel Bristol-Myers Squibb 2011 CRO Covance, Quintiles Takeda 2010 CMC is chemistry, manufacturing, and controls.

It is likely that they underestimated the risks and challenges of those sourcing deals and the abilities of their partners to handle them. The consequences of adopting a radical new sourcing strategy with untested partners could be dire, if not catastrophic. Boeing demonstrated that with its Dreamliner supply-chain fiasco. The company outsourced major com- ponents of its new 787 Dreamliner pas- senger jet (including large sections such as the wings and fuselage) to partners around the globe. The company found out too late that many of its partners were not up to the task, which resulted in delaying delivery of the new plane by at least two years. In one case, Boeing had to acquire one of the partners pro- viding critical components in order to regain control of the supply chain. Boeing ran into these major problems despite decades of experience in out-sourcing major components for its civil- ian and military aircraft programs. It is not a big leap to imagine newcomers to strategic sourcing, which the global bio/ pharmaceutical companies are, having significant problems themselves as they learn to master the new model. In cir- cumstances similar to Boeing's, several bio/pharmaceutical companies have been forced to buy back manufacturing facilities that they had sold to startup contract manufacturers after those CMOs ran into financial problems and put the bio/pharmaceutical companies' product supply at risk. The point here is not to question the major acquisitions cited above or to question the business strategies of CROs and CMOs aimed at expanding their service offerings. They are a response to what the global bio/pharmaceutical companies are actually doing today and to ignore that would risk being shut out from the biggest opportunities. The further risk, however, is that in the two or more years it will take to fully integrate the parent and acquired companies into a genuinely single en- tity, the sourcing paradigm may have moved to a different place. The lessons of the first strategic partnering efforts will have been learned and applied to different sourcing arrangements. In the meantime, the CROs that are already big will be using their large scale to further their lead with new capabilities. For instance, Covance, the second largest clinical services provider by revenue, recently an- nounced a new service to help bio/ pharmaceutical companies select clini- cal sites more efficiently by using a da- tabase that incorporates information from the thousands of trials they have serviced in recent years. The CROs playing catch-up don't want to find themselves in the position of planning for the last war. Like the French military leaders who built the \"impenetrable\" Maginot line after World War I, they risk being circumvented by new tech- nologies and the innovative strategies they make possible. PT contin. from page 135 national borders and without foreign co- operation, has been seriously questioned. A repeat must be avoided at all costs. Said Hamburg, \"We must continue to work together in a proactive, rather than re- active, manner in dealing with potential threats\" (1). In addition, the international financial crisis will affect budgets and limit the amount of money that govern- ments will spend on healthcare. As a re- sult, cooperation with other regulatory authorities in the framework of PIC/S has become a strategic and financial pri- ority for FDA. transforming Pic/s Today, PIC/S is set to become a major player on the international GMP scene. However, there are two limitations: the first is that not all important regulatory authorities are members, in particular countries such as China, India, and Japan. Second, PIC/S is competent in GMP (i.e., control at the manufacturing level) but not for controlling the entire supply chain. For example, the PIC/S mandate does not cover good distribu- tion practice (GDP). To address the issue of membership, the organization recently revised its accession procedure to include a pre- accession phase. This phase includes a gap analysis, thereby offering a safe op- tion to future applicants who may not be able to meet all PIC/S requirements immediately. Among the 160 guests who came to the PIC/S 40th anniver- sary symposium, several nonmembers attended, including representatives from Bulgaria, China, Croatia, Geor- gia, Hong Kong SAR, Hungary (Vet), Japan, Nigeria, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Turkey, and Uganda. Some of these nonmembers have since expressed interest in joining PIC/S. The organization has also proposed establishing a Memorandum of Un-derstanding with authorities that are unable to apply for membership. Russia signed a memorandum with PIC/S in 2010. Such agreements make it possible to include nonmembers into the PIC/S network and further facilitate global harmonization. PIC/S is also considering extend- ing its mandate to include GDP. The growth of the industry and the effects of counterfeiting have led to a need to strengthen overall pharmaceutical sup- ply-chain control. Little work is being done in other fora to coordinate and harmonize GDP inspections (except in the European Union). An initiative by PIC/S could fill a gap in the control system of medicines. reference 1. M.

Aranha gave her presentation at the meeting of the Council's Formulation and Drug Delivery Committee in Cambridge, Mas- sachusetts, on Sept. 16, 2011. The presentation included a discussion of the unique chal- lenges associated with ensuring virological safety, the impor- tance of pre- and postproduc- tion controls, and the value of a quality-by-design approach. Aranha's presentation followed recent reports of adventitious virus contamination of products and production environments. She emphasized the need for a holistic approach to virus safety. Rao Tatapudy, vice-president of scientific affairs at Catalent PharmTech: What is the biggest industry challenge you're now facing? Tatapudy: The productivity and efficiency of internal drug development have become big challenges in the industry. These challenges arise from the large size of a few Big Pharma companies (which results from consolidation), the emergence of several large generic-drug players, long approval times for both branded and generic products, and a short pat- ent life for new drugs. This situation is an opportunity for global drug-development and delivery companies that support the pharmaceutical industry. By offering support for a product's en- tire life cycle, including preformulation, product development, clinical supplies, commercialization, analytical services, packag- ing services, and regulatory support, these companies can posi- tion themselves to succeed in the current environment. PharmTech: Do you see a new industry trend emerging? Tatapudy: Yes. Big Pharma is struggling with extensive talent on hand and limited product-development budgets, partly because of mergers and acquisitions, and partly because fewer and fewer new drug applications are being filed each year. On the other hand, global drug-development and delivery com- panies are extremely enthusiastic about the prospects for growth and innovation and have expanded their horizons to serve the entire industry across most dosage forms. In partic- ular, because a large majority of new molecules in develop- ment are BCS class II and IV compounds with significant bio- availability challenges, highly specialized expertise in drug development, delivery, and manufacturing will be needed, and this situation will require drug innovators to work closely with specialty drug delivery companies such as Catalent.

compliance. A quality assur- ance specialist cannot cover all this ground alone. Perhaps most important, the team needs a senior executive who has the power to champion the right answer for the deal, even when that answer is \"no.\" Consider the following example. A US company wanting to acquire a high- growth product line made a play for a successful company headquartered in Australia. The rewards matched the com- pany's objectives: revenue from sales out- side the US would jump from 15 to 40%. However, the risks would be just as great: registrations and patents would require global management, and the success of the venture depended on keeping the sell- er's key people and infrastructure. The- due-diligence team included the COO as well as senior people from manufacturing, finance, legal, quality assurance, business development, and R&D, and an indepen- dent consultant to question assumptions. In addition to working with a virtual data room, the team spent two days interview-ing seven of the seller's top executives and one day touring the main production facil- ity. The team included a senior executive who would be in charge of the postmerger integration crucial to future revenue and earnings. Because the due-diligence team had the right people, the process contrib- uted significantly to the immediate and long-term success of the acquisition. Ask the right questions. In many ways, due diligence is a detective's game: the analysts need to look at clues (often from only par- tial data) and solve the mystery by defining the business case for the merger or acquisi- tion, identifying the ways each facility or function would contribute to (or detract from) the realization of the business ben- efits, and pinpointing risks to processes, functions, or the enterprise. Even compa- nies that do a lot of deals are wise to treat each one as a new and unique experience. Find weak spots and define fixes. The due- diligence team needs to address areas of risk, such as the costs and efforts required to harmonize operations, the timetable for fixing problems, and the investment needed for postmerger integration. For example, upgrading an acquired compa- ny's enterprise resource planning system would be expensive and resource-con- suming; its costs should be acknowledged. Use facts to negotiate. The financial de- cision makers want to know of any issue large enough to stop the deal. But even problems that are not dealbreakers could be used in negotiations. The due-diligence team needs to be prepared to talk to C-suite executives, bond-rating agencies, invest- ment bankers, and the sellers about issues, potential solutions, a course of action and as its timing and estimated price tag. Bring in the regulators early. The postdeal organization should inform FDA or other appropriate regulators of plans to fix rec- ognized problems. Regulators know that M&As can create confusion and inconsis- tencies, and they look for them during in- spections. Even if there are no problems, it is a good idea for the buyer to connect with regulators to help ensure a smooth transi- tion. Due diligence is a strategy for risk management and return on investment. When done right, it helps ensure value creation in a merger or acquisition. PT174 Pharmaceutical Technology OctOber 2011 PharmTech.com PharmTech.com/viewViewpoint DORLING KINDERSLEY/GETTY IMAGES James W. Bedford and Mark Ehlert in the business press, discussions of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in- variably include percentages of deals that did not create their expected value. Failure numbers, ranging from 60-80%, are surprisingly high. Many companies seem to pursue deals without a clear picture of their potential risks. A due-diligence process that's too high-level or superficial is often to blame. For example, when a life-science com- pany considers a merger or acquisition, the due-diligence team typically looks for 483s, Warning Letters, notified-body findings, and product recalls to find any signs of potential problems with FDA. But when a deal does not deliver value, the real causes are often strategic, cultural, or technical. Strategy: testing the business case Due diligence is not the same as a conduct- ing a quality assurance compliance audit. But in the life-science industry, it's easy to confuse the two. The executives or the private-equity firm structuring the deal do not necessarily understand the companies' operations or FDA sanctions. At the same time, if a CEO or CFO is enamored with M&As as a perceived means to expand into a new business or enter a new market, the due-diligence team typically lacks the busi- ness expertise to ask the right questions or the clout to raise objections. For example, Company A might want to buy Company B because of its supe- rior sales force. Company A's marketing department contends that sales would double; the finance department believes that redundancy would allow Company A to reduce payroll by 10%. Both predic- tions are correct, but no one calculates the extra manufacturing capacity needed to produce a larger portfolio and volume of products. The expected value of the deal could be canceled out by unanticipated costs in another part of the organization. The fundamental questions asked dur- ing due diligence should go beyond FDA compliance and tackle the business reasons for closing the deal. This approach requires having the right people (not necessarily those who happen to be available) on the due-diligence team. Technical executives might be asked about open citations, but they're rarely consulted about the likely costs of integrating factories, supply chains, or distribution centers\u2014or whether these integrations can be done at all. But if inte- gration costs more or takes longer than ex- pected, customer relationships and product quality can suffer. Culture: gauging compatibility Often in a merger or acquisition, the per- sonalities of the two companies are not considered relevant. But stress and tensions can build when the cultures of two orga- nizations are incompatible. The possible triggers of a poor \"culture fit\" are limitless: management style, risk tolerance, flexibil- ity, talent, technology, and geography, to name a few. Some life-science companies are risk-takers; others are conservative. Some are entrepreneurial; others are hi- erarchical. Some are obsessed with \"zero incidents\" quality; others have a \"find a problem, fix a problem\" management style. If the two cultures can't be blended, the cost of a significant restructuring (including re- cruiting and hiring new executives) needs to be included in the M&A price tag.Getting the most value out of M&As requires the right team and the proper up-front legwork.Managing Business Risks During a Merger or Acquisition James W. Bedford is vice-president of Regulatory Compliance Associates, j.bedford@rcainc.com. Mark Ehlert is president of 315 Ventures, marke75@ yahoo.com. technical integration Post-M&A integration is often the cause of extra, unplanned costs. For instance, a seller often ends up supporting sold-off processes or IT systems long after the deal is done.
