While states have primarily exercised responsibility for oversight of drug compounding , FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of drugs marketed in the United States, including animal drugs. FDA regulations generally allow for drug compounding for animals from approved animal or human drugs but not from bulk active pha rmaceutical ingredients \u2014the raw ingredients that make up finished drug products. Mistakes in compounding drugs for animals can result in injuries to or deaths of animals. GAO was asked to review drug compounding for animals. This report examines (1) the benefits and risks of drug compounding for animals, (2) the extent of drug compounding for animals, and (3) FDA's approach to regulating these drugs. GAO reviewed federal regulations and guidance, FDA documents, and 18 peer -reviewed and other studies asses sing drugs compounded for animals. GAO also interviewed federal and state regulatory officials, and a range of stakeholders in the animal health industry. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FDA modify its reporting form, develop guidance for agency st aff regulating compounding for animals, and document consistently the bases for its regulatory action s. FDA generally agreed with GAO's recommendations. What GAO Found Drugs compounded for animals offer certain medical benefits but also pose risks of caus ing harm or being ineffective. Specifically, drugs compounded for animals can serve as treatment options when no suitable drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is available. For example, no FDA -approved drugs exist to treat megacolon \u2014a potentially lethal form of constipation \u2014in cats, so veterinarians rely on a compounded drug for treatment. D rugs compounded for animals can also pose risks of serious harm or may be ineffective if they contain too much or too little of an active ingredient, according to scientific studies and veterinary experts. However, FDA has acknowledged that it is not practical for the agency to approve each drug compounded for every animal that requires one; as a result these drugs are not reviewed for safety and effect iveness. In addition, because states have primarily exercised responsibility for pharmacies that compound drugs for animals, the states and not FDA generally review pharmacy compounding processes. The extent to which drugs are compounded for animals is un known because the information FDA and states collect is not aggregated or comprehensive for various reasons. First, unlike animal drug manufacturers, drug compounding pharmacies do not have to register with FDA. Second, although FDA and states try to shar e information about drug compounding pharmacies with each other, due to some states' privacy and confidentiality laws this information sharing is impacted. For example, FDA officials told GAO that some states are unable to share information about the resul ts of their pharmacy inspections with FDA because of their states' privacy laws. Finally, FDA does not know the extent to which compounded drugs are associated with adverse events, in part because the form used to voluntarily report such events does not as k if a compounded drug was involved. F ederal standards for internal control state that agencies are to obtain information from stakeholders that may have a significant impact on achieving its goals . By not asking for compounded drug information on its reporting form, FDA is missing an opportunity to inform its enforcement actions regarding animal drug compounding. FDA does not currently have final guidance directing its regulatory approach on drug compounding for anima ls and has not consistently documented the bases for the actions it has taken to regulate such compounding in the past. Until May 2015, FDA had guidance to direct its regulation of drug compounding for animals. In May 2015, FDA withdrew the guidance becaus e it did not reflect FDA's current thinking on the issues and h as not yet replaced it. This lack of guidance is inconsistent with federal internal control standards and r aises concerns as to how FDA staff will make consistent decisions on enforcing animal drug compounding regulations in the future. Moreover, with regard to the actions FDA has taken against pharmacies compounding drugs for animals from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients, the agency has not consistently documented how or whether it follow ed up on these actions. This lack of consistent documentation is also not in accordance with federal internal control standards, and without complete and consistent documentation of its actions, FDA cannot ensure that its regulatory approach is being appli ed consistently.

Adverse events lin ked to drugs compounded for animals include the deaths of 21 polo horses given a performance -enhancing drug compounded by a Florida pharmacy in 2009.1 More recently, in 2014 compounded drugs intended to treat equine protozoal myeloencephalitis \u2014a serious di sease affecting the central nervous 1An adverse drug experience is any adverse event associated with the use of a new animal drug, whether or not considered to be drug related, and whether or not the new animal drug was used in accordance with the approved labeling (i.e., used according to label directions or used in an extralabel ma nner, including but not limited to different route of administration, different species, different indications, or other than labeled dosage). Adverse drug experience includes, but is not limited to: (1) an adverse event occurring in animals in the course of the use of an animal drug product by a veterinarian or by a livestock producer or other animal owner or caretaker; (2) failure of a new animal drug to produce its expected pharmacological or clinical effect (lack of expected effectiveness); and (3) an a dverse event occurring in humans from exposure during manufacture, testing, handling, or use of a new animal drug. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 514.3 Letter system of horses \u2014were produced at a pharmacy in Kentucky that resulted in the deaths of 4 horses and injuries to 6 others . Page 2 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 2 Compounding is a traditional component of the practice of pharmacy. Pharmacies sometimes compoun d drugs for animals, usually upon receiving a prescription from a veterinarian. Some pharmacies compound only animal drugs, while others also compound human drugs . Veterinarians sometimes compound drugs for the animals they treat, using their own supplies of approved drugs and bulk drug substances . Drug compounding is overseen at both the federal and state level. At the federal level, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of drugs marketed in the United States, including drugs intended for animals. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations, FDA approves new animal drugs and regulates their manufacture, marketing, and distribution. Drugs compounded from bulk drug substances for animals are considered new animal drugs under the act. However, the process of both animal and human drug compounding is also considered to be a pharmacy practice, which has traditionally bee n regulated by state pharmacy regulatory bodies (generally, boards of pharmacy), through state laws and regulations.3 In 2012, concerns were raised over this overlapping federal and state oversight of the practice of drug compounding for humans when an outbreak of fungal meningitis that killed more than 60 people and sickened hundreds of others was linked to contaminated compounded steroid injections. Although Congress subsequently passed the Drug Quality and Security Act in 2013, which provided for additio nal authorities with respect to drug compounding for humans, the legislation did not apply to drug compounding for animals. You therefore asked us to review issues related to drug compounding for animals and FDA 's oversight. 2The drug was intended to treat equine protozoal myeloe ncephalitis, which is a serious disease of horses caused by a parasi te spread through contaminated feed or drinking water. The disease causes lasting neurological damage. 3State pharmacy compounding regulations may also be enforced by state veterinary medicine boards. According to the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association , veterinarians have historically compounded drugs for in -office administration to animal patients or for dispensing to the owners of the animals. This report examines (1) the be nefits and risks of drugs compounded for animals, (2) the extent of drug compounding for animals, and (3) FDA 's approach to regulating such compounding. To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant federal law, regulations, and FDA guidance documents relevant to drug compounding for animals from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients. To understand FDA activities, goals, and objectives related to oversight of compounding, we reviewed the FDA Foods and Veterinary Medicine Program Strategic Plan 2012 -2016. We reviewed and analyzed other relevant FDA documents also, such as summary data and records of FDA regulatory activities, including documentation of compounding pharmacy inspections from 2002 to 2014 and reports of adverse events associated with veteri nary drugs from 2001 to 2014. We compared FDA's guidance regarding compounding drugs for animals, which FDA withdrew during the course of our review in May 2015, and documentation of actions FDA has taken against pharmacies compounding drugs for animals fr om bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients with relevant standards of internal control for the federal government, Page 3 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 4 and Office of Management and Budget instructions for drafting appropriate regulatory guidance.5 To assess the reliability of FDA's data, we i nterviewed FDA officials familiar with agency data systems and procedures for gathering, entering, and verifying data on actions FDA has taken against these compounding pharmacies , and adverse drug events, and reviewed agency documentation and guidance supporting data collection activities. We determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of determining FDA's actions to enforce regulations on drug compounding for animals. We also interviewed officials from FDA's Center for Veterinary Me dicine, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, and Office of Regulatory Affairs, including four district offices responsible for regulatory oversight in four states we selected for in -depth review. We selected these states \u2014California, Florida, Kentucky, and Texas \u2014 because they vary in how they regulate compounding, are geographically dispersed, and two of them (Kentucky and Florida) have been the site of adverse events linked to drugs compounded for animals within the last 6 4GAO, Standards of Internal Control in the Federal Government , GAO/AIMD -00-21.3.1 (Washington, D.C.: November 1999). 5Office of Management and Budget, OMB Memorandum, M -07-07, Final Bulletin for Agency Good Guidance Practices (Washington, D.C.: 2007). years, the period during which the most recent serious adverse events occurred. For the four states, we reviewed relevant state statutes and regulations concerning compounding and interviewed animal health officials, specifically, officials of boards of pharmacy and veterinary medicine and veterinary medical associations, and supervising pharmacists. We also interviewed such officials involved with horse racing in Kentucky and Florida because, according to animal health officials we interviewed, racehorses often receive compounded drugs. The information we obtained from these states is not generalizable, but it furthered our understanding of key issues involved in drug compounding for animals. In addition, we conducted a literature search of peer -reviewed and other scientific studies asse ssing the quality of some compounded drugs and analyzed the results of these studies. We selected these studies by searching electronic databases of scientific journals for relevant articles published from 2003 to 2014 in which the quality or effectiveness of compounded animal drugs was identified as a key feature and also based on suggestions from experts in veterinary pharmacology identified by the American Veterinary Medical Association, a nonprofit organization representing more than 86,000 veterinarian s nationally, and the Animal Health Institute, a trade organization representing manufacturers of animal drugs. Two GAO scientists with expertise in chemistry and biology reviewed each study we selected to confirm its methodological and scientific soundnes s. Finally, we interviewed a wide range of national stakeholders in the animal health industry, including veterinary pharmacology experts and representatives of trade organizations for drug manufacturers, pharmacists, and national veterinary associations specializing in equine and zoo animals. We identified these organizations in part from referrals by the American Veterinary Medical Association; the Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonpartisan, nongovernmental organization dedicated to informing public policy deve lopment; and the Animal Health Institute. For a more detailed discussion of the objectives, scope, and methodology for our audit, see appendix I. A list of the 18 studies we reviewed can be found in appendix II. We conducted this performance audit from Jun e 2014 to September 2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusio ns based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Page 4 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals Compounding can involve manipulating an FDA -approved drug formulation for use in a manner that is not provided for in the drug's label directions. For example, compounding can entail combining two or more FDA-approved drugs or adding a nondrug component \u2014such as flavoring \u2014to an approved drug. Alternatively, compounding can involve formu lating a drug from raw ingredients, which include bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients (also called bulk drugs) and inactive substances, such as fillers, or binders. Page 5 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 6 Drugs compounded for animals from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients are considered \"new animal drugs\" under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Before a new animal drug can be marketed under the act, it must be reviewed and approved or indexed by FDA for safety and effectiveness.7 Animal drugs that are not approved or indexed are considered unsafe and therefore adulterated under the act. According to FDA officials and documents, the agency's premarket review is integral to its ability to protect public health. During the premarket review, the agency evaluates information submitted by drug companies to determine whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use and that the drug is properly manufactured and properly labeled. According to drug manufacturers, this review process can be costly for drug companies and take many ye ars. In addition, after FDA approves the drug, the agency overse es the ongoing manufacture of the drug to determine that it is 6Bulk active pharmaceutical ing redients are active pharmaceutical ingredients generally sold and purchased in large quantities in pure (raw) form for use as key components in a finished drug product. FDA defines a bulk drug substance as any substance that is represented for use in a dru g and that when used in the manufacturing, processing, or packaging of a drug, becomes an active ingredient or a finished dosage form of the drug. In this report, to avoid confusion, we instead use the term bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients. 7Marketin g is the process or technique of promoting, selling, and distributing a product or service. An indexed drug is a legally marketed unapproved new animal drug intended for use in minor species that has had safety and effectiveness affirmed through an alterna tive FDA review process. According to FDA, in many cases, minor species drug products are intended for uses that cannot reasonably go through the standard drug approval process. They are often intended for use in species too rare or varied to be used in tr aditional safety and effectiveness studies. Background produced in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices requirements, which help ensure the quality of drugs. Page 6 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 8 8FDA enforces regulations called Current Good Manufacturing Practices. According to FDA, these regulations require proper design, monitoring, and control of manufacturing processes and facilities, including the use of strong quality management systems, appropriate quality raw materials, robust operating procedures, and reliable testing laboratories, among other things. Although drugs compounded for animals are \"new animal drugs \" under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDA has acknowledged that it is not practicable for pharmacies to complete and obtain approval for a new drug application each time a compounded drug is prepared for an individual patient, and a compounded d rug may be required in cases where a failure to treat would result in animal suffering or death. Page 7 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 9 The Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act of 1994 provides an exception that allows drug compounding under specific conditions for animals without FDA p remarket review and approval. The act and its implementing regulations authorize drug compounding for animals from FDA-approved human or animal drugs based on a prescription from a veterinarian for veterinary purposes under the following conditions:10 \u00b7 no approved new animal or human drug can appropriately treat the condition diagnosed when the drug is used as labeled in the available dosage form and concentration; \u00b7 the compounding is performed by a licensed pharmacist or veterinarian within the scope of a p rofessional practice; \u00b7 adequate procedures and processes are followed to ensure safety and effectiveness of the compounded drug; \u00b7 the scale of the compounding activity is in line with the established need for compounded products; and \u00b7 all relevant state laws relating to drug compounding for animals are followed. FDA regulations allow drug compounding for animals from FDA -approved human or animal drugs under these conditions, but the regulations also state that nothing in the regulation \"shall be construed as permitting compounding from bulk drugs. \" 9Drugs compounded for animals are not equivalent to generic animal drugs. Generic animal drugs, like new animal drugs, must be reviewed and approved by FDA before they are marketed to the public, and must comply with Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements. 1021 U.S.C. \u00a7 360b(4)(a); 21 an FDA -Approved Animal Drug Source Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc . | GAO -15-671 FDA-approved animal drugs will have a New Animal Drug Application (NADA) number, or for generic animal drugs, an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA ) number, which may ap pear on the label, though neither is required. A compounded drug label may state that the drug is FDA \"registered\" or \"listed,\" o r made in an FDA \"registered,\" \"inspected,\" or \"approved\" facility. None of these designations means that the drug is FDA approved, however. Most FDA -approved animal drugs are listed in a searchable online database (http://www.fda.gov/ AnimalVeterinary/Products/ ApprovedAnimalDrugProducts/ ) called the Green Book, published annually and updated monthly . Drugs compounded for animals offer medical and other benefits but may pose a risk of causing serious harm or being ineffective. Page 8 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals Drugs compounded for animals offer benefits such as providing treatment options when no suitable FDA -approved drug is available. For example, there are no FDA -approved drugs to treat megacolon \u2014a severe fo rm of constipation \u2014in cats, so veterinarians rely on compounded cisapride for treatment.11 According to representatives of organizations representing compounding pharmacists and veterinarians, there are no substitutes for cisapride in cats, and many cats wi th megacolon would have to be euthanized without cisapride treatment. Drugs compounded for animals may also be more suitable than other treatment options because they allow for easier and more appropriate administration of medication to animals. For exampl e, compounding a drug may consist of adding flavor (e.g., beef flavoring to a pain medication for arthritis) to increase its palatability or changing its form (e.g., creating a paste from a tablet) to provide a more convenient method of administering the m edication and to improve absorption. The ability to tailor medications through compounding is especially important in treating exotic animals. Compounding allows veterinarians to accommodate the extensive diversity of sizes and features associated with exo tic animals such as large mammals, reptiles, and birds. (For pictures of exotic animals receiving treatment with compounded drugs, see fig. 1.) 11Cisapride approved for human use was v oluntarily withdrawn from the U.S. market in 2000 because of severe adverse events includin g rare, but serious, heart rhythm disorders and several deaths. When drugs \u2014including drugs for humans that are commonly used to treat animals \u2014are removed from the ma rket, veterinarians rely on compounded drugs if there is no other approved drug available. Drugs Compounded for Animals Offer Benefits but May Pose Health Risks Drugs Comp ounded for Animals Offer Medical and Other Benefits Figure 1: Veterinarians Administer Compounded Drugs to Exotic Animals Page 9 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals Compounded drugs also may provide treatment at lower cost than FDA - approved drugs. The American Veterinary Medical Association, a professional organization of veterinarians, and the FDA have both stated that cost is not an appropriate reason to use compounded drugs instead of FDA -approved drugs, however. For example, some animal owners are unable or unwilling to buy an expensive FDA -approved drug, and a veterinarian may prescribe a lower priced drug compounded from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients to alleviate suffering or save an ani mal that might otherwise die. One veterinarian told us that veterinarians have prescribed a compounded drug for chemotherapy because such drugs are often prohibitively expensive for pet owners. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, anim als are rarely covered by health insurance. Because animal owners generally pay for animal drugs out of pocket, the availability of less costly drugs can be important to some animal owners, according to some veterinarians we interviewed. Drugs compounded for animals may pose risks of serious harm or may be ineffective for two reasons, according to FDA officials. First, FDA generally does not review drugs compounded for animals f or safety and effectiveness because, according to agency officials, it is not practical for FDA to approve each drug compounded for every animal that requires Drugs Compounded for Animals May Pose Risks of Serious Harm or Be Ineffective one. Second, because states have primarily exercised responsibility for pharmacies, according to agency officials, FDA does not generally oversee the compounding process for quality manufacturing practices. FDA's position that drugs compounded for animals may cause serious harm or be ineffective is consistent with findings from published scientific studies we reviewed, as well as with the views of veterinary pharmacology experts we interviewed. According to these scientific studies and veterinary pharmacology experts, some drugs compounded for animals may contain too much or too little of an active ing redient and, as a result, may be either toxic or ineffective. For example, a batch of ingredients that is not uniformly distributed could produce compounded tablets with different levels of the active ingredient. A 2011 study of clenbuterol, a drug intende d to dilate the bronchial airways in horses to ease breathing, found that a compounded formulation of this drug contained 70 times the concentration of the FDA -approved drug and likely led to deaths of 2 horses and adverse reactions in 11 others. Page 10 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 12 We revie wed four other studies that tested the accuracy of compounded drugs by comparing the drugs ' actual characteristics to the specifications on their labels.13 These studies found that the compounded drugs tested generally did not meet specifications. In a broa der assessment carried out annually by the Missouri Board of Pharmacy, about one -fifth of randomly selected compounded drugs obtained from licensed state pharmacies from 2006 through 2014 were found to contain substantially less or more (from 0 percent to 450 12J.A.

Page 11 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 14 We also reviewed 10 studies comparing reference drugs to drugs that were compounded to allow a different route of administration. These studies all found that the compounded drugs with an alternate route of administration were poorly absorbed, decreasing the likelihood that the drugs would be effective in clinical situations. In two additional studies, compounded drugs also exhibited poor absorption even though they had the same route o f administration as the reference drugs. (For a list of studies we reviewed, see app. II.) In addition, according to veterinarians we interviewed, because drugs compounded for animals are not tested by FDA and may not list side effects on their labels, the y may cause side effects that pose risks to humans administering these drugs. For example, compounded drugs may cause unforeseen side effects, including sporadic behavior, such as kicking in large animals, placing humans at risk. They may also cause side e ffects if the drugs contact human skin. To illustrate, a drug sometimes compounded to control estrus (i.e., ovulation) in horses has the potential to cause pregnant women who administer it to miscarry, according to a veterinarian we interviewed. Representa tives we interviewed from pharmacies that specialize in veterinary drugs said that, except for emergency prescriptions, they routinely test all the drugs they compound to ensure the appropriate ingredients are in the right proportions. However, they also s aid that not all compounding pharmacists test their drugs and that there is no legal requirement to do so. 14Missouri Board of Pharmacy, Annual Report (Jefferson City, MO: 2006 -2014). The compounded drugs tested were listed by name but not were not identified as human or animal drugs. According to FDA, the drug names included some active pharmaceut ical ingredients tested that are approved in both FDA human and animal drug applications. The extent to which drugs are compounded for animals is unknown because the information that FDA and states collect on drug compounding is not aggregated or comprehensive. FDA maintains information on pharmacies it has inspected for potentially violating compounding regulations, but states are the primary h olders of information on pharmacies. Unlike animal drug manufacturers, which are required to register with FDA, pharmacies \u2014including those compounding animal drugs \u2014are not required to register with FDA. States license pharmacies to practice in their border s and maintain certain information on pharmacy operations. For example, pharmacy representatives we interviewed in the four states we reviewed told us that state pharmacy boards keep records of pharmacy ownership, location, inspections, and regulatory nonc ompliance \u2014information that if aggregated and analyzed might shed some light on the extent to which drugs are compounded for animals. Both FDA and state pharmacy officials we interviewed said they try to share information to the extent possible, including i nformation collected during inspections where both FDA and state officials are present. FDA can also share some information with state pharmacy officials who have provided a written statement of authority to protect confidential commercial information from public disclosure and provide a written commitment to do so, or by commissioning state pharmacy board officials as FDA representatives. Page 12 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 15 Even with these agreements, however, FDA and state officials said that they might decline to share documentation usefu l for oversight purposes if they considered it to be confidential or personal. For example, FDA will not share such information with Florida state officials because the agency is required under federal law to safeguard such information from public disclosu re, and Florida 's open records law requires regulatory officials to make information broadly available for public review. FDA officials said that some states also have privacy and confidentiality laws that restrict pharmacy officials from sharing inspectio n information with FDA. Moreover, even if FDA were able to collect information on pharmacies 15FDA can share confidential commercial information and information concerning the deliberative process involved in an FDA inspection with state government officials u nder what is commonly called a \"20.88 \" agreement. The conditions and requirements for sharing such information can be found in section 20.88 of title 21 to the Code of Federal Regulations . According to FDA officials, the agency can share personal privacy information under such an agreement but does not do so routinely because of the sensitive nature of the information. The Extent to Which Drugs Are Compounded for Animals and Involved in Adverse Events Is Unknown from all 50 states, states do not always distinguish between compounding pharmacies and pharmacies that do not compound, or, according to FDA, among pharmacies tha t compound only human drugs, only animal drugs, or both human and animal drugs. As a result, aggregated information from states would not necessarily help FDA determine the extent of drug compounding for animals. Two of the four states we reviewed did not make a distinction between pharmacies that compound drugs in general and pharmacies that do not compound, according to state officials we interviewed. Page 13 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 16 FDA also does not know the extent to which compounded drugs may have caused or been linked to adverse ev ents, in part because it does not specifically solicit such information. To obtain information on adverse events reports, FDA relies on voluntary reporting from veterinarians and pet owners, as well as from pharmacies. Regulations require that drug manufac turers report adverse events associated with the drugs they produce, but regulations do not expressly require pharmacies to report adverse events associated with the compounded drugs they prepare. According to FDA documents, since 2001, the agency has received 62 voluntary reports of adverse events identified as being associated with drugs c ompounded for animals. However, this number likely does not represent the actual number of adverse events related to drugs compounded for animals, in part because the reporting form FDA uses in collecting information on adverse events does not specifically solicit information on whether the drugs involved in the events were compounded. (For a copy of FDA 's voluntary adverse event reporting form, see app. III.) According to FDA officials, incomplete information in adverse events reporting forms makes it diff icult for the agency to determine whether the drug involved was compounded and how often such adverse events actually occurred. Federal standards for internal control call for agencies to ensure that there are adequate means of obtaining information from external stakeholders that may have a significant impact on the agency achieving its goals.17 By not specifically asking, on its voluntary reporting form, whether drugs involved in adverse events were compounded, FDA 16For example, Florida grants licenses to sterile compounders, but it does not issue a special license to a pharmacy that compounds only st erile products. 17GAO/AIMD -00-21.3.1 . is missing an opportunity to gather infor mation that could help inform its future actions taken against pharmacies for compounding drugs for animals from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients. Agency officials told us that amendin g FDA 's voluntary reporting form to request this type of informati on would not be difficult and agreed that it could provide valuable information. Such information, for example, could potentially help FDA identify compounding practices or specific compounded drugs that may pose increased risks and that the agency could u se to help target its regulatory efforts accordingly. Until recently, FDA had guidance to direct its reg ulation of drug compounding for animals, but the agency no longer has such guidance because it withdrew it in May 2015 and has not issued new final guidance. In addition, the agency has not consistently documented the bases for the actions it has taken in the past against pharmacies compounding drugs for animals from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients. Page 14 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals FDA Does Not Have Guidance on Its Approach to Regulating Drug Compounding for Animals, and the Bases for Its Decisions Are Not Consistently Documented Until May 2015, FDA articulated its regulatory approach in a 2003 compliance policy guide the agency had issued to describe what factors the agency would consider in taking action for drug compounding for animals. Page 15 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 18 The guide stated that drug compounding for animals from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients violates the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, but the guide also stated that FDA would seriously consider taking action when the scope and nature of the activities of veterinarians and pharmacists raised concerns norm ally associated with drug manufacturing or resulted in significant violations of the act. We reviewed the guide and noted that it contained several limitations, including terms that were not defined. We discussed our observations several times w ith FDA off icials from July 2014 to March 2015. These officials pointed out the weaknesses in the guide and requirements for compounding. It is our conclusion, based on discussions with FDA officials, that they agree that the guide needed revision. For example, the guide stated that FDA would consider taking action if drugs are compounded using \"commercial scale manufacturing equipment,\" but did not define \"commercial scale.\" The guide also stated that FDA would not take action if drugs were compounded in anticipation of receiving prescriptions except in \"very limited quantities, \" but did not define what was meant by \"very limited. \" The use of such terms without clear explanation in the compliance policy guide caused confusion among stakeholders, a situation that makes compliance and enforcement difficult. In May 2015, FDA withdrew its compliance policy guide leaving agency staff with no guidance for regulating drug compounding for animals from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients. Prior to its withdrawal, compliance staff relied primarily on the guide when determining whether the agency would take action, according to FDA officials. A May 2015 Federal Register notice stated that FDA withdrew the guide because it is no longer consistent with the agency 's current thinki ng on the issues.19 18Food and Drug Administration, Guidance for FDA Staff and Industry: Compliance Policy Guides Manual, Sec. 608.400, Compounding of Drugs for Use in Animals (July 2003). 1980 Fed. Reg . 28624 (May 19, 2015). Specifically, FDA stated that the withdrawn guide did not focus on the three main concerns FDA has about animal drug compounding: compounding copies of approved animal or human drugs from bulk active pharma ceutical ingredients, compounding for food -producing animals from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients, and compounding office stock from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients. FDA Does Not Have Guidance for Its Regulation of Drug Compounding for Animals from Bulk Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Under federal standards of internal control, agencies are to clearly document internal controls, and the documentation is to appear in management directives, administrative policies, or operating manuals. Page 16 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 20 Without documented policy or gu idance, FDA staff do not have clear direction on which to base their decisions about whether and how to enforce regulations on drug compounding for animals, raising questions as to how staff can consistently enforce such regulations. In particular, this wi ll become more important as the draft industry guidance discussed below becomes final. As FDA withdrew its 2003 compliance policy guide, the agency also announced the availab ility of draft guidance for industry on drug compounding for animals from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients. The Federal Register notice stated that the draft guidance, when final, would represent FDA 's current thinking on the issues. Similar to the agency 's 2003 compliance policy guide, the agency 's draft guidance underscores that drug compounding for animals from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients violates federal law but acknowledges that compounded drugs may sometimes be an appropriate treatme nt option when no FDA -approved drug is available.21 Accordingly, the draft guidance describes conditions under which FDA will generally not take enforcement actions for violations of specific provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Animal dr ugs are generally subject to the adulteration, misbranding, and approval provisions of the act. However, generally, FDA does not intend to take action for certain listed violations of the act if the conditions set out in the draft guidance are met. (App. I V provides a complete list of the conditions in FDA's draft, as of May 2015, under which the agency generally does not intend to take action to enforce restrictions on drug compounding for animals from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients.) 20GAO/AIMD -00-21.3.1 . 21Food and Drug Administration, Guidance for Industry No. 230: Compounding Animal Drugs from Bulk Drug Substances (Draft Guidance) (Washington, D.C.: May 2015). FDA Has Proposed Guidance for Industry and Made It Available for Public Comment This draft gu idance includes specific lists of conditions that should be met by pharmacies, veterinarians, and outsourcing facilities. Page 17 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 22 For example, in the case of pharmacies, the drug should be com pounded by, or under the direct supervision of, a licensed pharmacist; in the case of veterinarians, the drug should be compounded and dispensed by a licensed veterinarian to treat an individually identified patient under his or her care. In addition, the prescription for a drug compounded by a pharmacist should include a sta tement from a prescribing veterinarian stating that there is no approved animal or human drug that can appropriately treat the disease, symptom, or condition. According to the Federal Register notice on the draft guidance, this guidance provides informatio n to compounders of animal drugs and other interested stakeholders on FDA's application of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to the compounding of animal drugs from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients. Since fiscal year 2003, FDA has taken various actions against pharmacies compounding animal drugs from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients , including conducting insp ections and issuing warning letters, to address potential problems regarding drug compounding for animals, but has not consistently documented the bases for these actions. Actions FDA may take against compounding pharmacies include inspections, warning letters, seizures, injunctions, and criminal prosecution. An inspection of a pharmacy typically involves examining, among other things, the condition of the facility, and a review of the types of drugs compounded, controls for sterile compounding, training records, 22In 2013, Congress enacted the Drug Quality and Security Act. This act amended the Fede ral Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to provide for \"outsourcing facilities. \" Outsourcing facilities are facilities that compound sterile drugs and agree to register with FDA. The act allows these facilities to compound drugs using listed bulk active pharmaceu tical ingredients if the facilities comply with a number of restrictions and requirements. According to FDA officials, the act applies only to drug compounding for humans. However, because pharmacies can compound drugs for both humans and animals at the same facility, drugs compounded for animals at such pharmacies are also subject to the requirements. FDA Has T aken Actions against Compounding Pharmacies but Has Not Consistently Documented the Bases for These Actions FDA Has Conducted Inspections, Issued Warning Letters, and Taken Enforcement Actio ns employee practices, complaints, and laboratory testing record s. According to FDA officials, the agency does not routinel y inspect pharmacies that compound drugs f or three primary reasons: \u00b7 FDA does not have a comprehensive list of such pharmacies because they are not required to register with the agency; \u00b7 FDA does not have the resources to routinely inspect the thousands of pharmacies and veterinarians that compound drugs for animals, even if such pharmacies were registered with the agency; and \u00b7 states regulate pharmacy practice and drug compounding. However, FDA officials said the agency has conducted inspections of compounding pharmacies in response to adverse events or complaints about illegal compounding, called \"for cause \" inspections. Page 18 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 23 Since fiscal year 2003, FDA has carried out 39 inspections in response to complaints related to drug compounding for animals, including multiple inspections at some pharmacies. FDA officials said that, depending on the results of an inspection, the agency may take several actions, including (1) issuing a warning letter telling a pharmacy it has violated the law and should take corrective action and (2) requesting a voluntary recall o f a potentially unsafe compound.24 If these actions prove ineffective, or the identified violations are particularly egregious, FDA officials said they have the authority to take legal action, such as obtaining an injunction to stop a pharmacy from operatin g. As a result of violations identified during those inspections conducted since 2003, the agency has issued 15 warning 23According to FDA officials, the agency received approximately $2 million in additional funding in fiscal year 2015 to address drug compounding for animals. With the increased funding, FDA plans to, among other things, develop and implement a surveillance program involving sampling and analysis of purchased compounded products to identify pharmacies that compound drugs for animals to conduct inspections based on risk assessment. 24FDA's authority to require companies to recall a product does not apply to drugs, including drugs compounded for animals. As such, all recalls of drugs compounded for animals are voluntary, according to FDA officials. FDA also issues n otifications about potential issues with drugs compounded for animals, which can be found at http://www.fda.gov/Anim alVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/ComplianceEnfor cement/UnapprovedAnimalDrugs/ucm417562.htm . letters to pharmacies, worked to have pharmacies issue three voluntary recalls, and taken four legal actions against pharmacies. Page 19 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 25 FDA is sued warning letters to compounding pharmacies and veterinarians for a variety of reasons, including compounding from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients in a quantity associated with manufacturing and compounding with no documented medical need. FDA officials said, however, that the agency has not pursued a legal action to stop a pharmacy from illegally compounding drugs for animals since 2010, when the agency sought an injunction against a Florida -based pharmacy. According to FDA 's legal complaint, FDA inspected the pharmacy following deaths of 21 polo horses that died after receiving a compounded drug from the pharmacy. During subsequent inspections, FDA observed violations of federal law at the pharmacy and informed the pharmacy of the violations. The pharmacy responded that its actions were not subject to FDA's new animal drug manufacturing authority. FDA then sought an injunction in federal district court to stop the pharmacy from distributing animal drugs compounded from bulk a ctive pharmaceutical ingredients. The pharmacy challenged the injunction on grounds that the agency did not have the authority to regulate pharmacy compounding for nonfood -producing animals because, among other things, Congress had recognized when enacting the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that traditional pharmacy practices were closely regulated by state authorities. The district court subsequently found in favor of the pharmacy. That decision was vacated as moot on appeal by joint motion of the pa rties, however, because the defendants stopped compounding animal drugs from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients. FDA officials said compounding pharmacies have brought such challenges to FDA's authority to regulate drugs compounded for animals on sever al occasions, resulting in legal reviews and appeals, but the courts have generally ruled in FDA's favor. (App. V provides examples of legal challenges to FDA's authority.) Even though historically FDA has prevailed in some animal drug compounding cases, o fficials said that the continued challenges to FDA's authority have led the agency to carefully consider which actions to pursue. FDA officials indicated these considerations include the resources that are required, as well as how 25FDA also requested eight other voluntary recalls that involved drugs compounded for animals. We did not include those recalls in this count because they were initiated in response to inspections related to issues with drug compounding for humans. flagrant the violations a re and how significant the threat is to animal and public health. FDA officials stated that decisions favorable to FDA in the past do not guarantee that future challenges to FDA's regulatory authority will result in the courts affirming this authority. Representatives of animal drug manufacturers and a manufacturers' trade organization we interviewed told us FDA does not seem to be taking much enforcement action despite the proliferation of drugs compounded for animals, which encourages compounding pharmaci es to circumvent FDA's drug approval process and may discourage manufacturers from developing new drugs. Moreover, according to these representatives, some pharmacies have moved beyond compounding based on a prescription for an individual animal to produci ng large quantities of compounded drugs from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients without prescriptions \u2014and sometimes providing these drugs when there is no medical need for them. These drugs are often sold at a lower cost than FDA-approved drugs, the re presentatives said. Animal health industry representatives we interviewed said that a compounded product \u2014when compounded from FDA -approved drugs in accordance with FDA regulations \u2014should be more expensive than an unaltered FDA -approved drug because the cos t of other ingredients (e.g., flavoring) and the cost of labor to alter the drug typically make the price higher. The representatives said that pharmacies selling compounded versions of FDA -approved drugs at a lower cost likely compounded the drug from bul k active pharmaceutical ingredients, which violates the law. FDA officials we interviewed told us they have worked to curtail similar illegal activity that compromises the integrity of the drug approval process. For example, 14 of the 15 warning letters FD A issued relating to drug compounding for animals since 2003 involved violations related to compounding from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients or compounding when FDA -approved drugs were available. In one of these cases, FDA turned to the federal cour ts, getting the U.S. Marshals Service to seize the illegally compounded drugs. In two others, the pharmacies receiving the warning letters agreed to cease compounding from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients or implement corrective action to address the ir violations. Page 20 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals FDA has not consistently documented the bases for its decisions about how or whether it followed up on warning letters, adverse event reports from the public, veterinarians, or pharmacies, or complaints about illegal compounding from manufacturers. FDA's follow -up to warning letters ranged from 9 months to years or no apparent follow -up at all. For example, in 2003, FDA issued a warning letter to a p harmacy after identifying several violations, including compounding on a scale associated with manufacturing, during an inspection of the facility. In that case, FDA was able to have compounded drugs seized \u2014which can involve lengthy legal proceedings and c oordination with other federal agencies \u2014from the pharmacy within 9 months of issuing the letter. In contrast, FDA issued a warning letter to another pharmacy in 2006 after identifying a similar list of violations, but the agency did not take additional action at the pharmacy until 2012, 6 years later, after the death of a horse was associated with a different compounded drug from the pharmacy. Documentation that FDA provided does not indicate whether (1) the 2006 violations were resolved or (2) a connection exists between the 2006 and 2012 events. As a result, we could not determine the bases for the differences in the agency 's follow -up activities to these warning letters. Similarly, FDA 's bases for its handling of adverse event reports was not always clear ly documented. For example, FDA provided documentation showing that agency staff had inspected and issued one pharmacy a warning letter in response to certain adverse event reports, but the violations identified in the warning letter to the pharmacy did no t reflect concerns raised or drugs used in the reported adverse events. In addition, FDA provided documentation indicating that one adverse event report linking a compounded drug to a horse death was referred to FDA 's Office of Emergency Operations because the event involved a death. Page 21 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 26 But the documentation the agency provided did not indicate whether other adverse event reports involving animal deaths had been similarly forwarded to the emergency operations office. FDA officials said that other adverse even t reports involving the death of an animal were most likely also forwarded to the office, but the agency could not provide documentation supporting this position. We were also unable to determine how FDA handles complaints about illegal compounding, which FDA typically receives by mail, e -mail, or telephone calls from drug 26The Office of Emergency Operations provides support and assistance to FDA offices in managing the agency 's response to emergency incidents and situations involvi ng FDA regulated products. FDA Has Not Consistently Documented the Bases for Its Actions against Compounding Pharmacies manufacturers because the agency does not track or collect this information. Page 22 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 27 FDA officials told us that the agency has taken actions in response to such complaints, but that unlike adver se events reports, it does not track the number or types of complaints received or document how such complaints are ultimately addressed. Under federal internal control standards, agencies are to employ control activities, such as appropriately documenting transactions and internal controls.28 Such control activities would require, for example, FDA to consistently document the bases for taking action or not taking action to follow up on a warning letter, adverse event report, or complaint, as well as how eac h case was finally addressed. As long as FDA does not have documentation supporting its actions about drug compounding for animals, the agency cannot ensure that its regulatory approach is applied consistently. FDA officials we inte rviewed said that offici als responsible for reviewing agency actions are expected to ensure that violations that are similar in nature receive consistent uniform responses from the agency. However, FDA officials also said compliance staff primarily relied on the 2003 compliance p olicy guide when determining whether the agency would take action. As previously mentioned, the guide did not clearly explain the conditions that warranted action and now that it has been withdrawn, staff have no guidance to follow to help ens ure a consist ent approach. The officials agreed that better documenting what actions have been taken and the reasons for them would help the agency ensure more consistency in regulating drug compounding for animals. FDA approves new animal drugs and regul ates their manufacture, marketing, and distribution, but drugs that are compounded for use in animals do not receive FDA review and approval. While drugs compounded for animals offer medical and other benefits, they also pose a risk of causing serious harm or being ineffective. To obtain information on adverse events, FDA relies on voluntary reporting by veterinarians and 27Complaints about illegal compounding typically involve issues with a compounding pharmacy 's operations in contrast to adverse event reports, which generally involve animal injuries resulting from treatment with a compounded drug . Complaints of illegal compounding include allegations such as compounding drugs for animals on the scale of a drug manufacturer or compounding copies of FDA -approved drugs from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients. 28GAO/AIMD -00-21.3.1 . Conclusions pet owners. However, the reporting form that FDA uses to gather such information does not ask whether the drug involved in an adverse eve nt was compounded. By not specifically asking on its voluntary reporting form whether drugs involved in adverse events were compounded, FDA is missing an opportunity to gather information that could help inform its future actions against pharmacies compoun ding drugs for animals from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients. In addition, until May 2015, FDA had a compliance policy guide in effect that described how FDA intended to address compounding of animal drugs from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients and the agency 's current thinking on what types of compounding might be subject to enforcement action. FDA 's guide had some limitations and FDA withdrew the guide in May 2015 because, according to its Federal Register notice, the guide was no longer consistent with the agency 's current thinking on drug compounding for animals. With the withdrawal of the guide, FDA staff no longer have documented policy or guidance on which to base their decisions about whether and how to enforce regulations on drug compounding for animals, raising questions as to how staff can consistently enforce such regulations. This issue is of particular concern as the agency is in the process of developing new guidance for industry on drug compoun ding for animals. Finally, when FDA has t aken actions to addr ess potential problems at pharmacies regarding drug compounding for animals, it has not consistently documented the bases for its decisions about how or whether it followed up on warning letters, adverse event reports from the public, veterinarians, and pharmacies, or complaints about illegal compounding from animal drug manufacturers. As long as FDA does not document the bases for its actions against pharmacies compounding drugs for animals from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients, the agency cannot ensure that its regulatory approach is applied consistently. To help ensure that FDA has relevant and timely information to support management decisions, inclu ding the critical information necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs compounded for animals, we recommend that the Secretary of H ealth and Human Services direct the Commissioner of the FDA to take the following three actions: \u00b7 Modify the voluntary reporting form FDA uses to obtain information on adverse events to ask whether drugs involved in adverse events were compounded. Page 23 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals Recommendations for Executive Action \u00b7 Develop policy or guidance for agency staff that specifies circumstances under which FDA will or will not enforce com pounding regulations for animals and clearly define key terms. \u00b7 Consistently document the bases for FDA 's decisions about how or whether it followed up on warning letters, adverse event reports, and complaints about drug compounding for animals. We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Health and Human Services for review and comment. The department transmitted written comments from FDA, reproduced in appendix VI, in which FDA generally agreed with our recommendations. FDA also stated that it has made substantial progress addressing animal drug compounding. In addition to withdrawing the outdated 2003 Compliance Policy Guide and publishing draft Guidance for Industry on compounding animal drugs from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients, the agency stated that it has taken other steps, including hiring a compounding coordinator to oversee all veterinary compounding, as well as hiring additional veterinary, consumer safety, and regulatory staff to assist in matters related to animal drug compounding. FDA stated that it also has expanded the agency's webpage dedicated to animal and veterinary compliance and enforcement to include information on inspections, recalls, and other actions involving firms that compound animal drugs. FDA also provided technical comments that we incorporated, as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and other interested parties.

Morris, Director, Natural Resources and Environment Page 24 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals Agency Co mments Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology This report examines (1) the benefits and risks of drug compounding for animals, (2) the extent of drug compounding for animals, and (3) the Food and Drug Administration 's (FDA) approach to regulating such compounding. To determine the bene fits and risks of drugs compounded for animals and the extent of drug compounding for animals, we conducted a literature search of peer -reviewed and other scientific research assessing the quality of some compounded drugs and analyzed the results. We selec ted these studies by searching electronic databases of science journals for relevant articles published from 2003 to 2014 in which compounded animal drugs were addressed. We also identified studies based on suggestions from experts in veterinary pharmacolo gy. These experts were identified by the American Veterinary Medical Association, a nonprofit organization representing more than 86,000 veterinarians in private and corporate practice, government, industry, academia, and the uniformed services, and the An imal Health Institute, a trade organization representing manufacturers of animal drugs. We also identified studies by looking at the references in these studies to find additional relevant studies for review. Two scientists with expertise in chemistry and biology reviewed each study used in our report to confirm its methodological and scientific soundness. (For a list of the research studies included in our review, see app. II.) We also interviewed pharmacology experts and pharmacy representatives knowledge able about animal drugs, including authors of the peer -reviewed studies we analyzed, and representatives with the National Community Pharmacists Association, and the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists. We identified organizations through thei r prior testimony before Congress on drugs compounding and based on recommendations of organizations knowledgeable about animal drugs compounding or pharmaceutical quality and safety, including the American Veterinary Medical Association, a nonprofit organ ization; and the Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonpartisan, nongovernmental organization dedicated to informing public policy development. In addition, we interviewed a wide range of representatives of organizations involved with the nation 's animal health indu stry. These organizations included trade organizations for drug manufacturers, such as the Generic Animal Drug Alliance and the Animal Health Institute. We also interviewed representatives of companies engaged in animal drugs manufacturing, such as Zoetis and Dechra. Both the trade organizations and company officials we interviewed were recommended to us by the Animal Health Institute or the American Veterinary Medical Association. Page 25 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology Appendix I: Objectives, Scop e, and Methodology We also interviewed representatives of a variety of veterinary specialties, as well as selected state and national veterinary associations to better understand how compounded animal drugs are used and how widely they are used. These included representatives of the American Veterinary Medical Association and representatives of the American Association of Equine Practitioners and the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians. We selected the aforementioned national organizations in pharmacy and animal health from those identified as having an interest in animal drugs compounding or a nimal health by the American Veterinary Medical Association, and the Pew Charitable Trusts. We also interviewed officials with state veterinary organizations in California, Florida, Kentucky, and Texas. The state -level veterinary associations we interviewe d were selected as part of a four -state review of the animal drugs oversight practices carried out by state authorities. We selected these states \u2014 California, Florida, Kentucky, and Texas \u2014because they vary in how they regulate compounding, are geographicall y dispersed, and two of them (Kentucky and Florida) have been the site of adverse events linked to drugs compounded for animals within the last 6 years, the period during which the most recent serious adverse events occurred. To determine FDA 's regulatory approach to drug compounding for animals, we reviewed relevant federal law, regulations, and guidance documents relevant to drug compounding for animals. To get a better understanding of the goals and objectives related to oversight of compounding, we revi ewed the agency 's most recent strategic plans and strategic priorities. Page 26 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 1 We reviewed other relevant FDA documents also, such as summary data and records of FDA regulatory activities, including documentation of compounding pharm acy inspections and reports o f adverse events associated with veterinary drugs. We compared FDA's withdrawn 2003 compliance policy guide regarding compounding drugs for animals and documentation of FDA's actions against pharmacies compounding drugs from bulk active pharmaceutical ingr edients with the standards of internal control for the federal government and Office of Management and Budget instructions for drafting appropriate regulatory 1Food and Drug Administration, Office of Foods, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Center for Veterinary Medicine, Office of Regulatory Affairs, FDA Foods and Veterinary Medicine Program, Strategic Plan 2012 -2016 (Washington, D.C.: April 2012) ; FDA Strategic Priorities 2014 -2018, (Washington, D.C.: undated). Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology guidance. Page 27 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 2 We obtained data from FDA on inspections, compliance actions, and recalls from 2003 to 2015, as well as adverse events from 2001 to 2015 that were linked to compounding of drugs for animals. To assess the reliability of FDA 's data we reviewed agency documentation of the systems used to collect and record the data and interviewed officials knowledgeable about those systems. We determined the data are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of determining FDA 's actions to regulate compounding animal drugs. We also interviewed FDA 's veterinary, regulatory, and drug evaluation officials in headqu arters offices and the FDA district offices responsible for regulatory oversight in four states we selected for in -depth review of their efforts to monitor drug compounding and the extent to which the states collaborate with FDA district offices. We review ed relevant state statutes and regulations concerning compounding and interviewed representatives of boards of pharmacy and veterinary medicine, veterinary medical associations and pharmacies, and the horse -racing industry. The information we obtained from these states is not generalizable, but it provided us with a greater understanding of key issues involved in drug compounding for animals. We conducted this performance audit from June 2014 to September 2015 in accordance with generally accepted governmen t auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. 2GAO, Standards of Internal Control in the Federal Government , GAO/AIMD -00-21.3. 1 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 1999); Office of Management and Budget, Final Bulletin for Agency Good Guidance Practices , OMB Memorandum M-07-07 (Washington, D.C.: 2007).

The draft guidance would apply only to entities compounding animal drugs from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients (bulk substances) \u2014specifically state -licensed pharmacies and veterinarians, and facilities that register with FDA as outsourcing facilities under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The draft guidance, for which FDA was receiving public comments at the time of our re view, states that generally, the agency does not intend to take action against a state -licensed pharmacy, a licensed veterinarian, or an FDA -registered outsourcing facility Page 36 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals 1 under a certain provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act if these ent ities compound animal drugs from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients2 in accordance with the conditions described below, and the drug is not otherwise adulterated or misbranded.3 The draft guidance states that entities should keep adequate records to de monstrate that the necessary conditions have been met. Table 1 below shows FDA's stated conditions in the draft guidance for each of the three types of compounders. 1The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act permits drug compounders to register with FDA as \"outsourcing facilities.\" An outsourcing facility is defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as a facility at one geographic location or address that (1) is engaged in the compounding of sterile drugs; (2) has elected to register as an outsour cing facility; and (3) complies with all of the requirements stated in the applicable provision of the act. 21 U.S.C. 353b. An outsourcing facility must report to FDA certain information about the drug products it compounds. If certain requirements are met , drugs that the facility compounds can qualify for exemptions from FDA new drug approval and select labeling requirements. Outsourcing facilities registered with FDA will be subject to inspection. 2In this report, to avoid confusion, we use the term bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients to indicate \"bulk substances,\" a term used by FDA. FDA defines a bulk drug substance as any substance that is represented for use in a drug and that when used in the manufacturing, proce ssing, or packaging of a drug, becom es an active ingredient or a finished dosage form of the drug. 3A drug is deemed adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act if it consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance or has been prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions, among other things. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 351. A drug is deemed misbranded if, among other things, the labeling is false or misleading. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352.

The label of any compounded drug indicates the species of the intended animal patient, the name of the animal patient, and the name of the owner or caretaker of the a nimal patient. The label of the drug includes the following: \u00b7 active ingredient(s ); \u00b7 dosage form, strength, and flavoring, if any; \u00b7 directions for use, as provided by the veterinarian prescribing or ordering the drug; \u00b7 quantity or volume, whichever is appropri ate; \u00b7 the statement \"Not for resale ;\" \u00b7 the statement \"For use only in [fill in species and any associated condition or limitation listed in Appendix A];\" \u00b7 the statement \"Compounded by [name of outsourcing facility]; \" \u00b7 lot or batch number of drug; \u00b7 special stora ge and handling instructions; \u00b7 date the drug was compounded; \u00b7 beyond use date of the drug; \u00b7 name of veterinarian prescribing or ordering the drug; \u00b7 the address and phone number of the outsourcing facility that compounded the drug; \u00b7 inactive ingredients; \u00b7 the statement \"Adverse events associated with this compounded drug should be reported to FDA on a Form FDA 1932a; \" and \u00b7 if the drug is compounded pursuant to a patient specific prescription, the species of the animal patient, name of the animal patient, and name of the owner or caretaker of the animal patient. Source: GAO analysis of FDA Guidance for Industry (No. 230). | GAO -15-671 Appendix IV: Key Provis ions of FDA's Draft Guidance for Industry on Animal Drug Compounding Note A: The draft guidance states that a sale or transfer of the compounded drug does not include a veterinarian administering the drug to a patient under the veterinarian 's care. The sale or transfer of a drug by a pharmacy to a person or another entity is called \"dispensing \" a drug while the act of giving a medication to an animal is called \"administering \" a drug. Note B: FDA's draft guidance states that all cattle, swine, chicken, turkey, sheep, goats, and nonornamental fish are considered food-producing animals regardless whether the specific animal or food from the specific animal is intended to be introduced into the human o r animal food chain. Accordingly, FDA considers pet pot -bellied pigs and pet chicks to be food -producing animals. In addition, the draft guidance specifies that any other animal designated on the prescription or in documentation accompanying the prescripti on by the veterinarian as a food -producing animal, regardless of species, is considered to be a food -producing animal, such as rabbits, captive elk, and captive deer. Note C: For example, the veterinarian could state that, \"Compounded drug X would produce a clinical difference for the individually identified animal patient because the approved drug is too large a dose for the animal and cannot be divided or diluted into the small dose required. \" Note D: Extralabel use means actual use or intended use of a drug in an animal in a manner that is not in accordance with the approved labeling. This includes, but is not limited to, use in species not listed in the labeling, use for indications (disease or other conditions ) not listed in the labeling, use at dosage levels, frequencies, or routes of administration other than those stated in the labeling, and deviation from the labeled withdrawal time based on these different uses. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 530.3(a). Note E: The draft guid ance did not identify the bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients (bulk substances) or the animal health conditions these ingredients may treat, but stated that FDA would identify them later with input from the public. Note F: Information that FDA requests registered facilities to provide the agency twice per year includes the active ingredient(s); and the source of the active ingredient(s); the strength of the active ingredient(s) per unit; the dosage form and route of administration; the package descriptio n; the number of individual units produced; and the National Drug Code number of the active ingredients, if available, and the final product, if assigned. FDA suggests that registered facilities for sterile drug products (called outsourcing facilities), id entify which of the drugs they report biannually to FDA were intended for animal use. Note G: According to FDA 's draft guidance for industry regarding good manufacturing practices, certificates of analysis contain key information about the bulk active phar maceutical ingredient(s) and testing information to ensure the ingredients are as specified on the label. This information includes the name of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, its grade, the batch number, the date of release, and expiration date. The certificate should list tests performed and the numerical test results obtained, it should be dated and signed by authorized personnel, and include the name, address, and telephone number of the original manufacturer, among other things. Note H: FDA enfor ces regulations called Current Good Manufacturing Practices. According to FDA, these regulations require proper design, monitoring, and control of manufacturing processes and facilities, including the use of strong quality management systems, appropriate q uality raw materials, robust operating procedures, and reliable testing laboratories, among other things. Note I: Form 1932A is the form FDA uses to collect voluntary reports of adverse events associated with animal drugs. See appendix III for a copy of th is form.

[Note A] Whether the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the authority to prevent a pharmacy from compounding drugs for animals from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida, held \"that, in enacting the [Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act] in 1938, Congress did not intend to give the FDA per se authority to enjoin the long - standing, widespread, state -regulated practice of p harmacists filling a veterinarian's prescription for a nonfood - producing animal by compounding from bulk substances.\" 816 F, Supp. 2d 1256. FDA appealed, but the case was subsequently vacated by the appeals court on appeal by joint motion of the parties, however, because the defendants stopped compounding animal drugs from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients . 2012 WL 10234948. 2008 Medical Center Pharmacy v.Mukasey [Note B] Whether drugs compounded for human and animal use are new drugs and subject to FDA's approval, and whether federal law permits compounding drugs from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients for nonfood animals. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that compounded drugs are \"new animal drugs \" under the Federal Food, Dr ug, and Cosmetic Act, and are subject to FDA 's approval unless the drugs meet the relevant qualifications of the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act of 1994. 536 F.3d 408. 2005 Wedgewood Village Pharmacy, Inc. vs. United States [Note C] Whether a pharmacy is exempt from FDA 's general inspection authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and whether or not a pharmacy suspected of large -scale compounding is covered by the pharmacy exemption for inspection of records under the Federal Fo od, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that pharmacies are not exempt from FDA 's general inspection authority, and despite the statutory exemption for pharmacies from records inspection provisions for pharmacies , FDA does not violate due process by conducting records inspections when there is probable cause to believe that the exemption does not apply. 421 F.3d 268 - 275. 1989 United States vs. Algon Chemical, Inc. [Note D] Whether FDA can enforce regulations that essentially limit the sale of new bulk pharmaceuticals to holders of \"new animal drug applications. \" Specifically, whether FDA could prevent a firm from distributing bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients to veterinarians for use in compounding animal drugs if the firm failed to abide by labeling requirements. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that FDA acted within its statutory authority in promulgating and enforcing regulations. 879 F.2d 1155.

The Department appreciates the opportunity to review this report prior to publication. Sincerely, Jim R. Esquea Assistant Secretary for Legislation Attachment GENERAL COMMENTS OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) ON THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE's (GAO) DRAFT REPORT ENTITLED \"DRUG COMPOUNDING FOR ANIMALS: FDA COULD IMPROVE OVERSIGHT WITH BETTER INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE\" (GAO -15-671) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) appreciates the opportunity to review and comment on the draft report. FDA has made substantial progress and has taken an active and deliberative role addressing animal Agency Comments Department of Health and Human Services Page 1 Page 2 Appendix VIII: Accessible Data drug compounding, proposing a framework intended to balance competing objectives and reducing the risk of harm to human and animal health. The Agency generally agrees with GAO's recommendations and FDA's work in this program area is ongoing. Fiscal year 2015 accomplishments to date include: \u00b7 Withdrawing the outdated 2003 Compliance Policy Guide 608.400 and simultaneously publishing a draft Guidance for Industry #230, Compounding Animal Drugs from Bulk Drug Substances. \u00b7 Hiring a Compounding Coordinator who reports directly to the Director of the Office of S urveillance and Compliance to oversee all compounding related to Center for Veterinary Medicine activities. \u00b7 Hiring 3 Veterinary Medical Officers, 2 Consumer Safety Officers, and 1 Regulatory Counsel to assist in matters related to animal drug compounding. \u00b7 Expanding the Animal and Veterinary Compliance and Enforcement webpage to include a page dedicated to Inspections, Recalls, and Other Actions with Respect to Firms that Engage in Animal Drug Compounding. GAO Recommendation: Modify the voluntary reporting f orm FDA uses to obtain information on adverse events to ask whether drugs involved in adverse events were compounded . FDA Response: FDA agrees with the GAO recommendation to modify the voluntary reporting form for veterinary adverse events (Form FDA 1932a) to seek information about whether the involved drug(s) were compounded. Steps are being taken to revise the Form FDA 1932a to specifically ask whether the product is compounded. However, changing the form will not rectify other factors that may have a lar ger impact on the adverse event reporting, including the voluntary nature of reporting, the fact that many reporters of adverse events may not know that the drug is compounded because the drugs are not usually labeled as compounded products, and the limite d information about the extent of compounding for animals (i.e., denominator data). GAO Recommendation: Develop policy or guidance for agency staff that specifies circumstances under which FDA will or will not enforce compounding regulations for animals an d clearly define key term s. FDA Response: FDA agrees with this recommendation and notes that it has already published a draft Guidance for Industry #230 (GFI #230) Compounding Animal Drugs from Bulk Drug Substances. FDA did not Page 60 GAO -15-671 Drug Compounding for Animals Appendix VII I: Accessible Data leave stakeholders without a ny indication of its current thinking on this issue, as stated by GAO on page 14 of the report, because at the same time FDA withdrew the outdated 2003 guidance, it published draft GFI #230, Compounding Animal Drugs from Bulk Drug Substances. The co mment period for the draft guidance closes on November 16, 2015, and FDA intends to take comments into consideration in quickly finalizing the guidance. Once the guidance is finalized, the document will explain FDA's current thinking with respect to compou nding animal drugs from bulk drug substances. GAO Recommendation: Consistently document the bases for FDA's decisions about how or whether it followed up on warning letters, adverse event reports, and complaints about drug compounding for animals . FDA Resp onse: FDA generally agrees with this recommendation. One of FDA's key initiatives is to develop and implement an enforcement strategy that addresses unapproved new animal drugs, including compounded animal drugs. As part of this initiative, FDA will docume nt its actions with respect to follow -up on warning letters, adverse event reports and complaints.
