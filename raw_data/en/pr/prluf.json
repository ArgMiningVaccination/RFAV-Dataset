The use of sandalwood for spiritual purposes goes back 4,000 years; it is often burned as incense to facilitate deep meditation. Sandalwood essential oil can be diffused in the home to still a restless mind, calm an over-attached mental state, reconnect with inner spirituality, and bring a sense of peace. Calming and consciousness-expanding, frankincense has been used in religious ceremonies for centuries as it promotes meditation and prayer. Frankincense essential oil is used to treat anxiety, stress and tension, and is helpful for calming the mind, thus aiding in the attainment of a meditative state. It also helps to slow breathing, a sign of deep relaxation. Atlas cedar is believed to be the descendant of the original Cedars of Lebanon whose groves were revered in Biblical times as sacred, mystical places. Atlas cedar essential oil can be diffused to create a calm, quiet atmosphere; it has a harmonizing, stabilizing influence. Spirituality is a part of us all but we get so caught up in the daily grind that sometimes it seems impractical to think about a higher power or a \"bigger picture.\" This is when we need to light a candle, diffuse Spiritual Awakening Synergy Blend, and reflect on the quote by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin: \"We are spiritual beings having a human experience, not human beings having a spiritual experience.\" 10 mL/0.34 bottle from Amrita Aromatherapy "}
