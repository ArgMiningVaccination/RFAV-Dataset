Testimonials It is a pleasure for me to give a testimonial for Dr. Oksana Mulyukova. For approximately, three years I have been her patient. I sought acupuncture treatment for chronic back pain and insomnia. My chiropractor introduced me to Dr. Mulyukova, and it has been a wonderful collaboration. As a cancer survivor - having undergone several months of chemotherapy and radiation- it was very important to me to adopt a natural treatment program rather than relying on drugs for pain management. My treatments with Dr. Mulyukova have allowed me to successfully manage pain without medication and to enjoy better sleep! The atmosphere in her clinic is peaceful, soothing, serene, clean, quiet. My visits are always relaxing, and I always feel better after my time with her. I have Breast Cancer and I was given a strong chemo that caused neuropathy. The pain kept me awake and I went to my GP who put me on Gabapentin and I didn't like the side effects. A friend suggested Dr Mulyukova for acupuncture. I set up and appointment and continue to this day. My pain has significantly decreased an I can sleep better. I highly recommend Dr Mulyukova and her acupuncture. The treatment extends to my body mind and soul. I feel \"blissed out\" after each treatment most of the time. I have been a patient of Dr. Mulykova's since October 2017. It is without hesitation that I'd recommend her skill set to anyone I know. I firmly believe it's a challenge to find and connect with a pure, honest, and enthusiastic health care provider. Dr. Mulykova exceeded my expectations immediately with her combination of poise and tenacity. She understands my mentality and is as aggressive as you'll allow her. Her technique is mastered and at any time she is not seeing the results expected she speaks up and reevaluates treatment. I am genuinely thankful for her patience, her communication, and her commitment to serve her community. I see Dr. Mulyukova once per week for I think 5 months now, and I don't think I could function the rest of the week otherwise. These days, I'm in constant physical pain and emotional turmoil with some mystery diagnosis that has my traditional medical team baffled, but I feel much better when I leave an acupuncture session. She is so caring and compassionate. I feel so fortunate to have found her services. She is very attentive to my needs and makes sure she is always treating me with the best care she can give. I was scared at first because of my dislike for needles but she quickly vanquished that fear with her knowledge and expertise. "}
