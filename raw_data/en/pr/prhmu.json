A 12 News Phoenix I-Team investigative report has noted that a loophole in Arizona law has enabled licensed naturopaths in Arizona to offer [liposuction](https://www.plasticsurgery.org/cosmetic-procedures/liposuction) and other cosmetic surgery. Some Arizona naturopaths are performing Brazilian butt-lift (BBL) surgery (gluteal augmentation or gluteal fat grafting), which has a mortality rate of [1 in 3,000 patients\u2014far higher than any other cosmetic procedure](https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/press-releases/plastic-surgery-societies-issue-urgent-warning-about-the-risks-associated-with-brazilian-butt-lifts). Naturopaths lack appropriate training to perform cosmetic surgery. This training normally includes three to five years of general surgery training followed by a two- to three-year residency program specifically focused on plastic surgery. Arizona's naturopathic licensure law allows practitioners to perform minor surgery, but the Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Medical Board has not defined it. Experts consider liposuction to be major surgery. The report tells the story of a liposuction performed by a naturopath for $3,275 on a man who was not given the necessary compression garment after surgery. The man healed lopsided and was left scarred, with hardened fluid around his abdomen. In 2019, the Arizona board decided not to discipline the naturopath. Arizona has the widest scope of naturopathic practice in the country. [Wilcox K, Buono B.

KPNX-TV Phoenix, April 16, 2022] FDA warns about prenatal screening tests. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning about false results, inappropriate uses, and inappropriate interpretations of widely used, non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) tests\u2014also called cell-free DNA tests or non-invasive prenatal tests (NIPT). These [laboratory-developed tests](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/in-vitro-diagnostics/laboratory-developed-tests) (LDTs) identify signs of genetic abnormalities in a fetus based on a sample of blood from the pregnant woman. The FDA advises patients to: (a) talk with a genetic counselor or other health-care provider both before deciding to have prenatal testing and after the results are received; and (b) not use screening-test results alone to make decisions about pregnancy\u2014additional testing is needed to confirm whether the fetus is truly affected. [ [Genetic non-invasive prenatal screening tests may have false results](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/genetic-non-invasive-prenatal-screening-tests-may-have-false-results-fda-safety-communication). FDA Safety Communication, April 19, 2022] Most NIPS tests are offered without FDA review. The FDA is concerned that advertising claims that NIPS tests are \"reliable,\" \"highly accurate,\" and offer \"peace of mind\" for patients may not be supported with sound scientific evidence.

FDA news release, April 19, 2022] FTC sues funeral and cremation businesses. On behalf of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Department of Justice is suing Funeral & Cremation Group of North America, LLC, Legacy Cremation Services, LLC, doing business as Heritage Cremation Provider, and their owner, Anthony Joseph Damiano. According to the [complaint](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Legacy%20Complaint%20%28Docket%29.pdf), the defendants allegedly: - claim on their websites and during phone calls with consumers to operate local crematories or provide local cremation services - frequently fail to disclose that they merely attempt to arrange for services by unaffiliated third-party funeral providers - in some instances, are unable to locate a funeral provider in the location sought by the consumer, and instead secure services in other locations that are, at times, up to two hours away, without first consulting with the consumer - routinely posted prices lower than consumers ultimately paid - violated the Funeral Rule by failing to disclose the total cost of the goods and services and failing to disclose that the prices they charge for cash advance items are higher than defendants' costs for those items - in some instances, unfairly withheld or threatened to withhold cremated remains or information about the location of cremated remains from consumers who refused to pay previously undisclosed fees and higher prices The FTC is asking the court to stop violations of the FTC Act and the [Funeral Rule](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/topics/truth-advertising/funeral-rule) and impose civil penalties on the defendants.

FTC press release, April 22, 2022] [Hide Full Content](#thirty-two-thousand-seven-hundred-eighty-six) [A Close Look at the NutriMost Fat Loss System](https://quackwatch.org/chiropractic/dd/nutrimost/) In April 2017, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission announced that the marketers of the NutriMost Ultimate Fat Loss System had agreed to settle FTC concerns that their program had been marketed deceptively. NutriMost has greatly modified its program and business practices, but it may be instructive to look at what happened before the FTC became involved. Background History The NutriMost Ultimate Fat Loss System was developed by Ray Wisniewski, D.C., a chiropractor who practices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [1]. He began franchising it in 2014 and, by January 2016, the program was available through more than 160 clinics, most of which were operated by chiropractors. For at least two years, the NutriMost Web site claimed that the Ultimate Fat Loss program was \"designed to help keep ... In April 2017, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission announced that the marketers of the NutriMost Ultimate Fat Loss System had agreed to settle FTC concerns that their program had been marketed deceptively. NutriMost has greatly modified its program and business practices, but it may be instructive to look at what happened before the FTC became involved. Background History The NutriMost Ultimate Fat Loss System was developed by Ray Wisniewski, D.C., a chiropractor who practices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [1]. He began franchising it in 2014 and, by January 2016, the program was available through more than 160 clinics, most of which were operated by chiropractors. For at least two years, the NutriMost Web site claimed that the Ultimate Fat Loss program was \"designed to help keep your hormones in the very narrow Ultimate Fat Burning Zone\" and that \"The typical results are 25 to 45 pounds of fat loss in a mere 40 Days!\" [2] The site also claimed that the program (a) \"virtually melts away\" fat, (b) targets difficult-to-lose fat areas, and (c) does not require exercise, strenuous dieting, or radical changes in life style [3]. These claims were preposterous. For several years, the NutriMost System was centered around use of a ZYTO device. ZYTO systems use a hand cradle (pictured to the right) that relays low-voltage signals to and from a computer that runs proprietary software that recommends products. Their manufacturer, the ZYTO Corporation of Orem, Utah, states that the software \"sends stimuli to the body using digital signatures that represent actual things\" and interprets fluctuations in skin resistance that indicate \"the body's degree of preference for the items being assessed.\" [4] I do not believe that skin resistance and the other data generated by the ZYTO have any practical health significance [5].ZYTO's hand cradle has FDA 510(k) clearance for the purpose of measuring galvanic skin response (the skin's resistance to the passage of electrical current). [65] However, the computer component of the ZYTO system that \"interprets\" the measurements is not cleared or approved for diagnosing anything, identifying \"toxins,\" preparing medications, or providing data relevant to weight-reduction. Nor, as far as I can tell, have the claims made for it ever been supported by a scientific study published in a recognized journal [7]. In May 2015, the FDA warned ZYTO Corporation that it was illegal to promote its ZYTO hand cradle for use in diagnosing a disease or condition or predicting biological responses to a wide range of virtual stimuli including drugs and nutritional supplements [8]. In promoting NutriMost, Wisniewski, who called himself \"the Weight Loss Answerman,\" claimed that excess weight is caused by the accumulation of \"toxins\" in body fat and that the ZYTO prepared and imprinted \"energetic resonant frequencies\" into customized formulas that \"tell your body's cells \"how to more effectively detoxify.\" The recommendations were embodied in a colorful report given to the patient, which stated: Utilizing the latest developments in cellular biocommunication technology we are able to \"listen\" to the body\u2014to determine what supplements and the exact amount of each supplement that the body has a biological preference for which tremendously aids our decision making to attain the best results for long lasting and permanent targeted fat loss. Here's how it works; Using the most advanced technology with the NRF (NutriMost Resonant Frequency) biocommunication technology, the computer sends a signal to the body in the form of a virtual stimulus, your body responds with very subtle changes in the electrical properties of your skin and the hand cradle measures these changes and sends that information back to the computer; it's like the computer's asking your body a question and your body's answering. . . . Utilizing NRF Technology and the NutriMost Ultimate Fat Loss scan we now have the technology to assess the factors of fat burning, fat storage and fat metabolism. Including the organs involved, the hormones, neurotransmitters, vitamins, minerals, toxins, heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, mycoplasma, candida or biotoxins. Our goal with this scan is to create a personalized and customized plan that will address your body's top organ stressors as well as finding the best products to balance those biological stressors. All weight gain involves imbalances within the body's organs and hormones. To have lasting and permanent weight loss we must correct these organ and hormonal imbalances. The NutriMost Ultimate Fat Loss Scan has been programmed to help give your body the nutritional tools that it needs to overcome these specific imbalances and to promote bringing the body into a very narrow hormonal range for optimum fat burning. . . . . We expect to not only bring your body into the optimum fat burning zone but also balance and correct both the organ and hormonal stressors allowing us to go beyond weight loss and help you to actively create a lifetime of health [9]. These concepts are nonsensical. Obesity is not caused by toxins or infectious agents. Cells do not have \"resonant frequencies.\" And ZYTO cannot \"imprint\" frequencies into products or \"assess\" anything related to obesity or body health. After the FDA warning letter was issued, I noticed that many of the NutriMost clinic Web sites stopped mentioning the ZYTO by name but instead said that the program relied on \"Comprehensive Electro-Impedance Resonant Frequency Technology\" or \"CERF Technology.\" Before the FTC settlement, more than 60 people contacted me about their experience with a NutriMost practitioner. They reported that the program cost about $2,000 and included: - The ZYTO scan. [The scan reports I have seen](http://www.devicewatch.org/reports/zyto/nutrimost_scan2.pdf)identified (a) \"top 5 out of range organs affecting fat loss,\" (b) \"weight loss/fat loss product balancers,\" (c) \"signatures for the detoxification formula,\" (d) \"resonant frequencies in your energetic hormonal formula,\" (e) \"top 7 vertebral stressors,\" (f) a \"positive belief change affirmation,\" and (g) \"preferred foods.\" Such data have no science-based significance. - A 96-page manual that contained theoretical explanations, detailed instructions, and recipes. - A very-low-calorie \"food plan\" that supposedly caused the body to get into a \"near perfect and exact fat burning state.\" The NutriMost manual claimed that hunger would not occur because \"appetite will naturally be suppressed by the 2000 up to 7000 calories of fat you will be burning dues to the weight loss program.\" The typical recommended caloric would be 500 to 800 calories per day with very little carbohydrate. - Weight-loss formulas prepared with the help of the ZYTO device. To ensure their potency, the directions said to \"sucuss\" them by tapping the bottle on the heel of the hand 8-10 times in rapid succession. The bottle marked \"H 14\" was said to have been customized for one of the patients who complained to me. The sales process typically began with a radio ad, a newspaper ad (see example to the right), or a lecture that invited people to undergo a free or low-priced evaluation. Although many of the ads referred to the \"technology\" of the ZYTO scan, the device was not mentioned and the initial consultation was centered around being weighed on a scale said to determine the person's percentage of body fat and \"metabolic age.\" In reports I have seen, the \"metabolic age\" number was much higher than the person's actual age. Several people told me that they were very frightened when told that their metabolism was \"like that of a 90-year-old.\" The ZYTO scan did not take place until after the full (nonrefundable) program is purchased. Most people who contacted me reported that during the sales process, they were not told that the calorie content of the diet was extremely low. Practitioners typically offered a \"discount\" to patients who paid the full amount in advance and signed a contract which said that no refunds would be given. Some contracts I have seen included provisions intended to protect the clinic owners from complaints. They said (paraphrased): - NutriMost does not provide any medical advice, medical treatment, or diagnosis. - The health information and materials given to the customer are provided with no warranty that they are fit to use. NutriMost does not assume responsibility for any errors. - The information provided is \"not necessarily based on scientific or reliable tests or studies.\" - No product offered or recommended by NutriMost is intended to treat any medical condition. - NutriMost will not be liable for any type of damages the customer many incur by using the information, advice, services or products provided. - The customer agrees not to post any statements criticizing NutriMost through any online medium and agrees that any violation of this provision would make the customer liable for $35,990 in liquidated damages. - The customer agrees to waive any rights under any law that would limit the waiver of any such rights. I doubt that most people who signed such contracts understood what they were signing. The NutriMost manual claimed that men typically lose between 35 to 45 or more pounds in 40 days, while women tend to lose 27 to 32, that the system \"ALWAYS works,\" and that loss of 20 pounds is guaranteed. However, the \"guarantee\" was not a refund. The only thing available to those who fail was another 40-day cycle of the program\u2014provided that they had kept all of their appointments, kept a diary, \"followed the system and did not cheat and could show that.\" The NutriMost contract stated that those who stopped the program in less than 40 days because they felt ill or because it didn't work for them would not be eligible for a refund. However, several people have told me that their money was refunded after they threatened to complain to the chiropractor's licensing board, their state attorney general, and/or the Better Business Bureau and, if necessary, to file a lawsuit. To get a refund, some clinics required patients to sign a \"release of claims and non-disparagement agreement\" that prohibited them from discussing their experience unless compelled to do so by a subpoena, regulation, or court order. The agreements I have seen included a 2015 copyright notice from NutriMost Doctor's LLC. In 2016, many NutriMost sites reworded the guarantee this way: Although results may vary, those who follow the program typically have a very high success rate. NutriMost guarantees at least 20 pounds of weight loss by the end of your entire program. If you do not lose at least 20 pounds, you will have your program extended until the total weight loss reaches 20 pounds, with all associated costs paid by your NutriMost office. If within 90 days, you have not reached at least 20 pounds of weight loss while on the program, your NutriMost office will refund any amount from the cost of the program which you as the client deem to be fair up to the entire cost of the program. It seemed logical to me that people who were unable to follow the program (for health reasons, for example) would still be eligible for a refund. When asked, I advised callers who believed that they had been misled that if no immediate refund was offered, it might be practical to file suit under their state's unfair and deceptive acts and practices laws [10], many of which enable plaintiffs to collect triple damages (or a substantial penalty) plus attorney fees. In 2016, I noticed that more than 60 NutriMost Web sites had content that is identical except for the details about the individual clinic. Most have also had \"before and after\" pictures of the same six individuals who were said to have lost from 27 to 47 pounds on the program. I assume from this that the licensing arrangements included a pre-designed site that could be individually customized and that the six people were not clients of the clinics that displayed their testimonials. Searching with Google I found that at least 40 of these clinics contained this statement: Although Dr. Ray has been traditionally trained as a Doctor of Chiropractic, he presents and offers NutriMost services as member only services under his Pastoral Medicine License # L29076049. Dr. Ray is a Christian who believes that God created this body with an amazing healing power and that there is nothing outside the body, that is as powerful as the power that God put inside the body. Pastoral Medicine is the Professional Blend of Scriptural Health Wisdom and Understanding along with Leading Edge Science. The NutriMost services are pastoral health services and should not be confused with state regulated services. I do not believe that \"licenses\" issued by the Pastoral Medical Association (PMA) confer any legal right to practice a health profession [11]. I also believe that any service offered by licensed health professionals should be subject to regulation by their licensing boards, but only a few boards have addressed this issue. Some have ruled that PMA \"licensing\" does not convey the right to practice a licensed profession, but others have decided that if PMA-related activities are carried out as a separate business, they will not intervene. Regardless of what licensing boards decide, I believe that state attorneys general have jurisdiction under state consumer protection laws. Curiously, at least 17 of the chiropractors who operated NutriMost clinics that utilized ZYTO testing have been subjected to regulatory action at some point in their career and least six are no longer licensed as chiropractors [12]. In December 2016, the NutriMost Web site stated that more than 125,000 clients had used the program during the previous three years. I also noticed that the site and nearly all of the franchisee sites no longer mentioned the ZYTO or its technology. Since that time, NutriMost has removed ZYTO testing from its program, stopped using \"no-refund\" contracts, toned down its weight-loss claims, and raised the caloric level of its recommended diet. Wisniewski has also stopped referring to his PMA \"license\" and asked NutriMost franchisees to do the same. In 2016, I was able to obtain a working ZYTO device and tested myself 43 times in ten days. The software differed from the program used by NutriMost but was close enough that the results were relevant. Sixteen of the tests were \"basic\" scans that purported to detect problems with 20 body organs. These scans reported an average of 11 problematic organs, but the organs specified and the supposedly corrective products varied considerably from one test to another. I also took 12 food-category tests and 15 individual-food assessments. As with the basic scans, the individual-food scores were wildly inconsistent, with many foods scoring \"positive\" (recommended) on one test and \"negative\" (not recommended) on another administered a few minutes later. My basic scan results were so inconsistent that they could not possibly be clinically meaningful. In addition to being inconsistent, my food-category biosurveys recommended excluding so many foods that the resultant diets could be extremely unhealthful. These findings confirmed that the claim that ZYTO devices can provide useful information is preposterous [13]. Government Actions In 2016, shortly after NutriMost decided to stop using its ZYTO program, the Federal Trade Commission contacted the company to express concerns about the claims and other advertising practices that had been associated with its use. Without admitting fault, NutriMost signed a settlement order under which NutriMost: - Is barred from making deceptive claims or providing franchisees with the means to deceive consumers. - Is barred from making weight-loss claims unless they are supported by competent scientific evidence. - Must not represent that users do not have to follow a restricted diet. - Must not require buyers to sign a contract barring them from making negative statements about the NutriMost system. - If using a diet of less than 800 calories a day, must disclose this fact during the sales process. The agreement also called for payment of $2 million to cover refunds to consumers who bought the system directly from the NutriMost clinics operated by Wisniewski (not from the clinics operated by others). [14-16] In 2019, the FTC mailed checks for $560.64 to 3,483 people who had bought the NutriMost program between October 1, 2012 and August 9, 2016. In 2017, the California Board of Chiropractic Examiners accused Cynthia Benkert, D.C. and Carlos Seals, D.C of a long list of improper acts in connection with operation of their clinic, NutriMost SoCal. The document noted that in addition to making fraudulent claims about ZYTO testing and the NutriMost System, both chiropractors had represented themselves as \"licensed\" by the Pastoral Medical Association, which was \"not recognized by any regulatory agency as a legitimate governance body.\" [17] About ten days later, Benkert voluntarily surrendered her chiropractic license, but she continues to do business as PuraVida Wellness. Seals's chiropractic license was revoked in 2018. In 2017, the Indiana Attorney General and the Indiana Board of Chiropractic Examiners charged Peggy Grabinski-Solano, D.C. with false advertising and failing to practice accordance with the body of scientific systematized knowledge related to the healing arts. The case was settled with agreements under which she was assessed $5,000, placed on indefinite probation, and required to (a) take 24 hours of continuing education, (b) perform 50 hours of community service, (c) pay refunds totaling $4,290 to two patients who had complained to the board, and (d) make full or partial refunds to 142 patients seen between July 1, 2016 and June 11, 2018 who request them [18,19]. In 2019, the Iowa Attorney General announced that two chiropractors had agreed to issue refunds to NutriMost customers [20]. Bradley Cook, D.C., who operated NutrMmost of Iowa in Marengo and Cedar Rapids and had 484 customers, agreed to pay $50,000 [21]. Emmett Blahnik, D.C., who operated Next Level Weight Loss in West Des Moines and had 253 NutriMost customers, agreed to pay $30,000 [22]. Better Business Bureau Reports For more than two years, the Better Business Bureau of Pittsburgh gave NutriMost LLC an \"F\" rating based on \"advertising issues\" and the company's failure to respond to seven complaints. In January 2013, the BBB asked Wisniewski to substantiate a long list of claims on his Weight Loss Answer Man Web site, including the \"25-45 pounds in 45 days\" claim mentioned above. The BBB report noted that he did not reply [23]. About a year before the FTC settlement, NutriMost began transforming the company from one that was essentially Wisniewski and his chiropractic staff to a more developed company with structured departments and additional personnel. The expanded team modified the dietary program, eliminated ZYTO testing, abandoned business practices that had been criticized, and entered a formal partnership with the national BBB that included review of future ads. In response to these changes, the BBB revised its rating to A. In July 2017, the main BBB site listed about 80 other NutriMost businesses under separate names. Of these, 14 had \"F\" ratings and several reports noted that the advertising claims violated the BBB Code of Advertising, Similar Clinics Three companies in New York and New Jersey have used NutriMost's name and/or sales materials: - A chain of clinics in the New York City metropolitan area is making claims that are nearly identical to those of NutriMost. The proprietors appear to use a ZYTO device in the same way but also tests hair and saliva samples as part of its evaluation. Its [Web site](http://www.nuvofatloss.com/our-services/)calls the system \"Nuvo Fat Loss.\" The proprietor is Arthur Tourovets, D.C. - In 2014, Howard Werfel, D.C., a New Jersey chiropractor who had licensed the NutriMost system for his office, began offering a similar program through outlets in several states under the name \"40 Day Reset.\" NutriMost LLC responded with a lawsuit accusing Werfel of trademark infringement, unfair competition, and several other wrongs. ZYTO Technologies was also named as a defendant [24]. An attachment to the complaint indicates that NutriMost's licensing fee was an initial $24,999 (with a 10% discount for full advance payment) plus a monthly licensing fee of $599 [25]. - In December 2015, NutriMost LLC sued Healthy Living Nutrition, Inc., for using NutriMost's basic video and some of its promotional words on the Web site cantlosediet.com [26]. Since 2014, Ray Omid, D.C. of Jericho, New York, has offered the \"LightenUp Ultimate Fat Loss System\" with claims and methods that sound nearly identical to those that NutriMost used in 2015. Other Legal Actions In 2015, Nutri/Systems, IPHC Inc., filed an opposition to trademark registration of the word NutriMost, asserting that use of the word \"nutri\" in association with goods or services closely related to those of Nutri/System could cause confusion resulting in damage to Nutri/System. The opposition was withdrawn when NutriMost modified the description of the services associated with its proposed mark [27]. In 2016, NutriMost sued three chiropractors and their associated clinics in Idaho, Indiana, and Michigan for breach of contract after they stopped paying fees called for in their franchise agreements [28]. NutriMost itself was sued by Patrick St. Germain, D.C., who purchased what he believed to be the exclusive right to market in portions of Florida. The suit charges that Wisniewski and NutriMost Doctors LLC improperly enabled another chiropractor to open clinics in the same region [29]. The purchase agreement included licensing fees of $50,000 up front for the first four clinics, $15,997 for each of four more offices when opened, and $5,000 per month plus 3% of the monthly sales related to weight loss at all but one of St. Germain's facilities [30]. For at least two years, he has done business as Burn Fat Orlando with no mention of either NutriMost or Zyto on his clinic Web site. However, when I phoned on August 25, 2017, I was told that ZYTO scanning was still used. Previous Wisniewski Promotions Wisniewski, who graduated from Palmer Chiropractic College in 1982, has marketed himself enthuiastically throughout his career. In 1992, in a chiropractic newspaper ad, he and a colleague stated that they each had been serving more than 1,200 patients per week and that chiropractors who attended their seminars would learn \"how to get and process over 50 new patients in one day with just one doctor\" and \"how to make in the 7-digit range overhead.\" In 2008, Man\" Web site stated: Dr. Ray Wisniewski, the Health Care Answer Man, has tirelessly and relentlessly served his community for the past 25 years. He has performed nearly one million office visits, and has seen and helped nearly every condition imaginable. This has allowed him to develop a high level of skill, experience, and competence, and has resulted in the office becoming one of the largest Chiropractic offices in the country. . . . Over the past 25 years, Dr. Ray has repeatedly challenged himself to improve his art and skills by taking and presening seminars. He passionately researches information so he can provide his staff and patients with the most current and accurate health methods available. He constantly upgrades his office to utlize the most advanced state-of-the-art technological equipment for optimum results. His staff is educated, caring and the most capable assistance in the health field. . . . He is considered one of the top nutritional consultants and alternative healers in the country, and is certified in QRA (Quantum Reflex Analysis), which has been called the medicine of the 21st century [32] Quantum Reflex Analysis is an [applied kinesiology](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/ak.html) variant whose proponents claim that \"imbalances\" throughout the body can be diagnosed by testing muscle strength and corrected by ingesting dietary supplements needed to \"restore balance.\" [33] Wisniewski's Nutrition Answer Man Web site, which also described him as \"One of America's Premier Doctors,\" contained many statements that I believe were absurd: - Lowering cholesterol naturally, the NutriMost way, is one of the easiest things to do. Especially when we consider that when it is done artificially with medication it can increase your chance of dying. - For high blood pressure: \"Medications are dangerous and do not correct the problem\u2014they merely cover it up. . . . The most effective way to begin healing any condition is to first correct any interferences of the nervous system [with specific spinal adjustments]\" - If you want to be healthy, do our 6 Essentials of Health: (1) balance the pH (using a NutriMost product), (2) detoxify your body, (3) balance all hormones & nutrients in the body as well as water and oxygen, (4) restore and rejuvenate homeostatis of all body systems, (5) eliminate chronic infections, and (6) most important\u2014balance the nervous system!! - \"Another thing that you can do to assure your best health would be to utilize the Superfood Trio every single day. This assures that you have every single vitamin, mineral, nutrient, trace element, synergist, co-factors, active transporters, and essential fatty acids that you require. This is the ultimate insurance, and it is all grade 10, free of any excipients or toxic tag-along's. This is best of the best nutrition.\" - Ascorbic acid is not vitamin C [34]. From 2008 through 2011, Wisniewski's NutriMost site stated: As your Healthcare Professional, we use the most advanced testing to specifically determine your precise supplement and nutrient needs based upon your unique biochemistry. This now makes Nutrition & Wellness, evidence based. As you will see below, these invaluable tests can give a precise evaluation of your body to help unlock the solution to your health issues, allowing you to reach a level of health that you may not have experienced in a very long time [35]. The site also offered \"vitamins customized for you\" via a \"Home Vitamin Analysis Test,\" the details of which were not posted on the site. [36] From 2011 through 2014, Wisniewski's EZ PracticeGrowth.com Web site offered an \"Automatic Robotic New Patient Income Generating Machine\" that was promised to \"bring in New Patients and sell products over the Internet all on autopilot.\" The system, which cost $3,800, contained videos, PowerPoint presentations. a patient communication system, a media distribution system, an \"explosive\" practice-building course, a service that answered patients' questions, the chiropractor's own store and Web site, and turnkey programs for diabetes, lupus, scleroderma, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, candida, auto-immune conditions and weight loss [37]. A flier distributed in 2014 claimed that nearly every doctor using the system was collecting over $100,000 per month [38]. Wisniewski no longer promotes any of the above systems and the Web sites associated with them are no longer online. The Bottom Line Diets that are very low in calories are not much different from total starvation and are dangerous. The FTC has determined that the claim that a product \"safely enables consumers to lose more than 3 pounds a week for more than 4 weeks\" cannot be true because that rate of loss can result in gallstones and other health complications [39]. Limiting calories to 500 to 800 per day can cause people to lose about 3 pounds of fat per week if they can actually do it, but NutriMost claimed that more than twice this rate was possible. It is clear that the ZYTO device, the weight-loss formulas, the dietary strategies, and the NutriMost Ultimate Fat Loss System as a whole could not work as advertised. In 2017, NutriMost redesigned its approach along more standard lines, raised the caloric content of its diet program, abandoned use of the ZYTO device, advised clinic operators to stop using abusive contracts, and promised the FTC that any future weight loss and health claims would be supported with competent and reliable scientific evidence. NutriMost's current program begins with an analysis called \"NutriMost Intelligence,\" in which the client receives diet and supplement recommendations based on the answers to questions in an iPad app. A NutriMost official told me that the company plans to conduct an appropriate study of its revised program, but I do not know the details of the program or the proposed study. Whether NutriMost can demonstrate that its program is effective and worth its high cost remains to be seen. Despite the FTC action, some clinics run by former NutriMost providers still appear to be using programs based on ZYTO testing.

She would also like you to believe that her experience as a patient has qualified her to give advice about cancer. She warns people not to trust the medical profession. Her Web site states that \"the entire foundation of conventional medicine is based on ERROR.\" [1] Her videotapes state that standard cancer treatment has never cured anyone and that nobody should undergo chemotherapy and radiation for any cancer [2]. She claims that (a) all cancers are essentially the same; (b) the basic cause is weakness of the immune system; and (c) her diet-centered program cures people by strengthening their immune system [2]. She states that, \"All diseases are caused by a combination of three factors: malnutrition, dehydration, and stress.\" [3] She tells people that, \"Drugs never cure disease; they only change the form and location of the disease.\" [4] She claims that \"sugar is as addictive as cocaine\" and paralyzes the immune system for four hours\" after eating it [4]. She claims that \"osteoporosis is not caused by lack of calcium\" and that \"the more milk you drink, the more osteoporotic you become.\" [4] She spouts long lists of health problems that she claims are caused by commonly used foods and drugs [4]. She also advises against vaccination [5] and the use of standard treatment for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder [6]. She speaks eloquently and from the heart, but her tapes contain hundreds of factual errors and far-fetched claims. In my opinion, her advice is untrustworthy and is particularly dangerous to people with cancer. She is also a rabid antisemite. |Please Help Our Ongoing Investigation | Background History A Los Angeles Times Magazine article states that Day's father was a Seventh Day Adventist minister with a firm hand. While attending the University oif Southern California as an undergraduate, she worked as a floor model. She then worked as a dental hygienist but \"wanted to do something that made a difference.\" [7] She graduated from the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine in 1969 and then trained in orthopedic surgery at two San Francisco hospitals. Her Web site states that she subsequently became an associate professor and vice chairman of the department of orthopedics at the UCSF medical school and chief of orthopedic surgery at San Francisco General Hospital. During the mid-1980s, she received considerable media attention related to the risk of acquiring AIDS through exposure to the blood of AIDS patients during trauma surgery. Her book AIDS: What the Government Isn't Telling You, states that in 1989 she resigned from her job because she thought the risk of getting AIDS was too high [8]. The L.A. Times Magazine article provides a vivid description of the controversy that led up to her resignation [7]. Day says that she noticed a small breast lump in 1992 but did not seek medical care until about a year later [2]. A [pathology report posted to her Web site](http://www.drday.com/rumors/llulab.htm) states that October 26, 1993, she underwent an \"excisional biopsy\" in which a 1.7 centimeter tumor was removed and found to contain an infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma that extended to the margins of the biopsy specimen [10]. [A medical report dated November 2, 1993](http://www.drday.com/rumors/scrippshistory.htm) indicates that she was advised to have more of her chest area and the lymph nodes under her armpit removed and then undergo radiation treatment [10]. The doctor's note indicates that Day wanted only the wider chest surgery. Day's \"Cancer Doesn't Scare Me Anymore\" video [2] indicates that a few days later she had a second operation to remove the cancerous margins, but the extent of this surgery and the pathology report are not posted on her Web site. Then, according to the tape, she began eating a strict vegetarian diet, eliminated all refined sugar and processed foods, and drank large amounts of vegetable juice. All went well, she says, until nine months later when her tumor returned, this time the size of a marble. Realizing that \"diet was not enough,\" she turned to \"alternative methods . . . one after the other\"\u2014a total of 40 of them\u2014trying each one long enough to see whether it worked. (She does not say how she could tell whether a method worked or how long it would take to decide.) Then, she says: Suddenly my tumor grew from the size of a marble to the size of a large grapefruit. And it did this in just over a period of just over three weeks. . . . It was the size of a softball. By this time the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes under my arm and at the base of my neck and I knew I was in big trouble. At first, surprisingly, the tumor wasn't very painful, but over time the pain became more and more intense until even but even the strongest narcotic pain medicine would not touch it. . . . . Now I became so sick I had to close my office. As things got worse, I became essentially bedridden and the pain continued to increase. The tumor was so heavy that when I got up even to go to the bathroom I had to support the weight of the tumor with my hand. My body was in total collapse. I had symptoms of numerous other diseases besides cancer. Not only did I have this huge painful tumor on my chest that I had to look at every day, but I had developed a tremor in my right hand that was a specific symptom of Parkinson's. . . . In addition, I had symptoms of multiple sclerosis on the left side of my body, my leg became numb from my knee down, I lost some control of my left leg, and my left arm felt like someone was always grabbing it. The tips of my fingers and toes became numb and cold, a disorder known as Reynaud's syndrome. I developed what appeared to be allergies to all foods except three. Whenever I would eat any others, I would collapse and have to be on oxygen. And I was overwhelmed with depression and anxiety to the point that my heart felt like it was going to jump right out of my chest. I was a mess. For over a year I continued to get worse, all the time becoming more anxious and more discouraged. But I kept going forward. I kept studying and trying one thing after another and I kept studying the Bible and praying, asking the Lord to show me how to get well. But nothing worked. My cancer kept getting worse. Because my pain was becoming intolerable, I found one surgeon who was willing to remove a portion of the tumor just for pain relief without forcing me to have mastectomy or chemotherapy. And all the rest of the tumor was left in place, including the lymph nodes. Then they sent me home to die. I became so sick that I was essentially bedridden for six months. As my cancer progressed, I became unable to eat and then unable to take fluids. At one point I was not expected to live through the night. My husband who saw my life rapidly ebbing away as my breathing became more and more labored said to me, \"I've got to take you to the emergency room. You're dying.\" And I knew I was. As a trauma surgeon caring for victims of massive injuries, I've seen a lot of people die. I know what death looks like. And I was dying. But I refused to go. I knew that if I went to the hospital they would give me drugs. I knew that I had so little life left in me that the drugs would kill me. I also knew that God says in his word that he forgives all our sins and heals all our diseases. God says, \"I am the Lord who heals you.\" My husband and I had been praying together three times a day every day since I'd been ill. I had claimed the healing promises in the Bible, while at the same time following everything I knew how to do, including eating the original diet God gave in the Garden of Eden: fruits, grains and vegetables in their most natural form. I decided I had to continue to trust God. I wanted to stay under his protection and depend on Him rather than depend on human medical knowledge which is nothing more than drugs. . . . Because I'd been unable to eat for three weeks, nor take in fluid for three days, I was rapidly becoming very dehydrated. I knew I could not continue for long without water. Then the Lord impressed on my mind something I had heard was done in medicine 60 or 70 years ago before the introduction of intravenous fluids. Dehydrated patients could be rehydrated through the colon by water dripped in slowly by enema. The colon can absorb water and even nutrition in the form of wheat grass juice, carrot juice, or green leafy vegetable juice. That's the way I stayed alive for the next few days until I could drink. At that point of death, I had decided to trust God with my life and He showed me what to do. Then over the next few weeks and months I started to understand the rest of the 10-step plan. Sometimes the information would come to me through the mail anonymously. Sometimes I would become impressed to study in a certain area. And information that I had previously read now became clear in the way it applied to my situation. Of course, all the time I continued to pray and asked the Lord to show me the way to get well. Finally, the entire plan became clear. From the time I started on the whole 10-step plan with 100% commitment, it was just eight months until all my cancer was gone. It went away slowly, one day at a time. Then it took an additional ten months for me to regain my strength. So in 18 months I was totally well and cancer-free. I'll soon be 64 years old and I am healthier than when I was 30. I have lots of energy and I don't have an ache or a pain anywhere [2]. Unanswered Questions One way to judge whether a story is accurate is to see whether it is internally consistent. Day's story is not. She states that her cancer grew from marble to grapefruit size in about three weeks\u2014and her video shows a mass in the front of her chest. (It might be interesting to know why she videotaped it.) Then, she says, she proceeded to do 40 \"alternative\" treatments, one after the other, until she could tell whether each one worked. How long did it take to try these out? What happened to the tumor size during this period? She said the tumor became painful and was so heavy that she had to support it with her hand when she walked. The allegedly tumorous area in the video does not appear large enough to fit this description. Did the tumor continue to grow at an extremely rapid rate? If it enlarged and she intended to document what happened, why doesn't she show subsequent videotapes? Did she actually have a tumor recurrence, or was the swelling she displays in her video merely a large benign cyst (walled-off collection of fluid) or swelling due to inflammation? Day says that when the tumor recurred, the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes under her arm and in her neck. Yet she describes no further medical care at that time. How could she know whether her lymph nodes were cancerous without obtaining a biopsy? If she had a lymph-node biopsy, why hasn't she posted a pathology report showing that she had cancerous nodes? Day says that as her condition worsened, she developed Parkinson's disease; multiple sclerosis; Reynaud's syndrome; allergies to all but three foods; and severe anxiety and depression. How likely do you think it is to develop four significant unrelated illnesses in a short period of time? Do you think it is possible to be allergic to all but three foods? (I don't, because many foods never cause allergic reactions.) Do you think it is likely that eating other foods could produce an allergy so severe that the person would collapse and require oxygen? I don't. Anaphylactic shock is a severe allergic condition in which the person has great difficulty breathing. But the appropriate treatment would be adrenalin, not oxygen. It could also be asked why she happened to keep oxygen handy and why, if it were critical, she didn't die the first time she had one of her \"allergic\" reactions. Is it possible that her \"allergic\" symptoms were merely anxiety attacks that included rapid breathing (hyperventilation)? She states that she became bedridden for months and implies that this was the result of her cancer. It seems to me that severe depression and possibly malnutrition were more likely to be responsible. She then says that over a year she \"continued to get worse\" and the pain got so unbearable that she had further surgery. I assume she means worse than when she had the serious ailments described above. Is that possible? She does not describe the surgery in detail and does not provide documentation of what happened. Why doesn't she post her pathology report for this third operation? What about her pain management? Why did she delay surgery that she thought could relieve her pain? She says at the beginning that her pain was so unbearable that \"even the strongest narcotic couldn't help.\" She says elsewhere that she did not want medical care because doctors rely on drugs and drugs cause cancer. Yet she apparently took \"the strongest narcotics\" and did not explore other pain-relief measures such as injections that might deaden the nerves that deliver the pain. She expresses antagonism about cancer surgery that she regards as mutilating. Yet she delayed seeking a minor operation that would not only relieve her pain but would also improve the appearance of her chest. Her willingness to suffer for years rather than seek timely medical care strikes me as extraordinarily poor judgment. Day states that after slowly recovering from what she describes as near death, she apparently decided that she had found the answer to cancer and began marketing her insights to the world. She apparently believes that her single experience entitles her to declare that virtually everyone who does what she recommends will be helped. And she apparently believes that it is appropriate to tell people that medical treatment has never succeeded in curing cancer. These claims are absurd, but people who are frightened, possibly desperate, and uncertain what to do might decide to follow her advice instead of getting proven care. Day acknowledges these feelings, states that she has been there herself, and offers an alternative to chemotherapy, radiation, and \"mutilating surgery.\" This message can be very powerful because when people feel \"understood,\" they are prone to believe what they are told. As far as I can tell, Day stopped seeing patients in 1989 and never returned to practice. She still holds a California medical license but her primary activity is the sale of books, tapes, and dietary supplements. Her educational materials were published by [Rockford Press](https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/CBS/SearchResults?SearchType=CORP&SearchCriteria=Rockford+Press&SearchSubType=Keyword), which she appears to operate from her home. Day's Response to \"Vicious Rumors\" Day notes on her Web site that \"vicious rumors have been circulating\" and that letters have been sent to \"people in leadership positions\" warning them not to have her speak to their groups. In response to this, she distributed several pages from her medical records and posted part of this information on her Web site. These documents (which I have seen) and what she did with them raise still further questions. Day's videotaped account [2] states that she developed a Parkinson's disease tremor in her right hand and weakness of her left arm and leg between her second and third chest operations, which would be some time in 1994. However, there is good reason to believe that this was not the first time she had these symptoms. The clinical note of November 4, 1993 was actually longer than the half-page report Day has posted to her site. The original report was at least two pages long and stated at the bottom that it was a \"History and Physical.\" [The section below what Day posted](http://www.drday.com/rumors/scrippshistory.htm) reads: In other words, the doctor reported that Day told him that her left-sided weakness, tremor, and probable diagnosis of Parkinson's disease occurred 3 or 4 years before the episode she described in her \"Cancer Doesn't Scare Me Any More\" videotape. A line at the bottom of the page states \"History and physical continued,\" which means that there was a physical examination that Day has chosen not to post. (I do not have the page or pages that followed.) She also cut off the bottom of the pathology report of the specimen obtained at her second surgery. According to Day: My Scripps Memorial Hospital Biopsy Report, on November 4, 1993 showing -\"Microscopic Residual tumor at previous bx (biopsy) site.\" with a Diagnosis of: INFILTRATING DUCTAL CARCINOMA. (Pathologist, P. Price) This biopsy also showed that the surgeon at Scripps Memorial Hospital was also not able to remove all of the cancer. Cancerous tissue was still present at the margins, even after the surgery [11]. To back this claim, [Day has posted a page with two images](http://www.drday.com/rumors/scrippsbiopsy.htm) [12]. The upper image shows the top 3 inches of the \"Surgical Pathology Report.\" The body of the pathology report is not included. The omitted portion (which I have seen) describes three specimens: (A) a large specimen of \"left breast tissue,\" which is said to have no residual cancer; (B) a small specimen of \"pectoral fascia tissue,\" which is said to have microscopic cancer present; and (C) a small sample of \"most medial breast tissue,\" which is not interpreted on the page. It appears to me that there is at least one other page to this report and that the report cannot be fully interpreted without seeing the pathologist's conclusions. The lower image is a full-page copy of her \"Breast Staging Worksheet,\" dated November 5, which contains the handwritten words \"Microscopic residual tumor at previous biopsy site\" at the top. I don't know whether these words refer to the situation before or after her November 4th operation. Moreover, the studies were done on frozen sections, which probably means that a final and more definitive report exists but was not distributed by Day. Unlike the first biopsy report, the records she distributed do not state that the tumor extended to the margins of the specimens. Thus, as far as I can tell, her response to the \"vicious rumors\" does not actually demonstrate that the tumor remained after the second procedure. It would not surprise me if the final pathology reports showed clear margins, which would mean that the cancer might have been fully removed. So far, Dr. Day has turned down three requests to provide the \"missing\" records. On April 15, 2002, the Director of Health Ministries for the Seventh-day Adventist Church sent a [letter ](http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/Day/williams.html)asking Dr. Day for copies of the final pathology report from Day's second operation and complete records of her third operation [13]. On May 28, [Day replied ](http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/Day/williams.html#dayreply)that she had already released everything that was needed to prove that she had had cancer, that he had no right to ask for further information, and that there was no \"incompleteness\" in her records [14]. The issue, of course, is not whether she had cancer but whether it was cured by the surgery she had. Early in June, she refused a similar request made by telephone by a newspaper reporter in Arizona. On June 8, I sent my own request, to which she replied: Could you please tell me on what authority you are asking for information. Just because you have the funds to pay the monthly web site hosting fee for your own Web site does not give you authority to ask for anything from anyone. Who appointed you as the guardian of America's health? [15] Basic Facts The idea that diet can cure cancer by \"strengthening the immune system\" is a fairy tale. Although diet is a factor in whether cancer develops, there is no scientific evidence or logical reason to believe that dietary strategies can cure cancer. The idea that a \"natural diet\" can do so is absurd. In recent years, medical scientists have proven that cancer results when the genes that control cell growth mutate. Genes govern and control all basic physical traits, including eye color, hair color, skin color, and even tendencies toward some diseases, such as diabetes. Day's claims are the equivalent of saying that eating raw vegetables can change blond hair to brunette [16]. Even if Day is correct that her methods are the answer to cancer, how can she be certain? Has she ever done a study to see whether people who follow her advice appear to benefit? Does she make any effort to gather follow-up information? Does she know\u2014or care\u2014what happens to cancer patients who abandon standard medical treatment after viewing her videotapes? I know of one case in which a 68-year-old man with cancer in his throat and behind his nose canceled scheduled treatment with radiation after seeing one of Day's videotapes. At that time, the doctors thought this treatment had 70% chance of curing him. Without treatment, however, the cancer gradually spread to the surrounding tissues. Over a two-year period, the cancer became extremely painful and ate a hole through the roof of his mouth that makes it difficult for him to eat without the food going out his nose. Radiation and chemotherapy therapy made the cancer disappear from his nose and throat, but it has recurred at the base of his brain. Chemotherapy may still prolong his survival, but his trust in Day's story reduced the quality of his life and appears to have shortened it by several years. Another case I know about involves a 39-year-old woman who suddenly discovered that she had a malignant melanoma that had metastasized to her brain. The doctors thought that without treatment she might live for a few months and that with chemotherapy, she might live for up to a year. Some people in this situation decide that they want to live as long as possible, whereas others decide that it would not be worth suffering with chemotherapy for such a short extension. After listening to Day's tapes, this woman became terrified about chemotherapy and decided that Day's methods would cure her. She lived for about two more months, during which she stopped eating nearly everything she enjoyed and ate mostly raw vegetables and fruits. Before she got sick, eating had been one of her favorite activities. But during her final weeks, she felt miserable because she craved her usual foods, but she would not eat them and wound up \"basically starving herself\" and losing 40 pounds. I advise people who are terminally ill to spend their remaining time as pleasantly and productively as possible. The patient's older sister, who shared this story with me, believes that Day's advice greatly reduced the patient's quality of life. Dietary Supplement Hype In addition to selling tapes, Day sells vegetable powders and other dietary supplements. For many years, the main one was Barley Green, a product marketed by [YH-International](http://www.yh-international.com), a multilevel (MLM) company for which she is a distributor. Day's Web site advises taking the product \"to help rebuild and maintain a healthy immune system.\" [17] According to Day: Barleygreen is a green powder made from the dried juice of the young green barley leaf which contains the widest variety of important nutrients in the plant kingdom. . . . Green barley leaves contain a multitude of enzymes necessary for digestion, more than a dozen vitamins, 17 minerals, 18 amino acids and chlorophyll. Barleygreen is a whole food concentrate. It is as close to its natural state as possible thereby supplying the nutrients in their natural proportions [18]. During the late 1980s, Barley Green was distributed by another MLM company whose distributor kit featured a videotape claiming that the American food supply is lacking in nutrients and filled with toxins. The videotape also alleged that vegetables are \"void of nutrients \" and that preservatives, artificial flavors, dyes, emulsifiers, artificial sweeteners, and other \"unnatural chemicals may rob the body of energy and vitality. \"Fortunately, the tape said, a Japanese researcher named Yoshihide Hagiwara had \"produced a cell food to balance the lacking American diet.\" One segment of the videotape stated that Barley Green contained \"16 organic vitamins, 11 major minerals, 18 amino acids, 12 trace minerals, and enzymes\" and had \"captured the life essence.\" However, another segment of the tape stated that barley leaf contained \"25 kinds of vitamins, including B15, K, and P.\" (Actually, there are only 13 vitamins for humans, and B15 and P are not among them.) Barley Green was also claimed to \"fight pollutants in the body\" and to contain \"live enzymes,\" including many that are found in white blood cells. The fact that these enzymes would be destroyed during digestion and therefore would fail to enter the body of Barley Green users was not mentioned; nor was the fact that the amounts of most nutrients in Barley Green were insignificant. In 1988, the FDA ordered the company to stop claiming that Barley Green would make people more energetic and was effective against cancer, arthritis, high blood pressure, obesity, depression, and many other health problems. The FDA also told the company to stop making false statements about the quality of the American food supply [19]. In 1989, the FDA seized quantities of several AIM products because their labeling or promotional material exaggerated the dietary value of the products. The case was settled by a consent decree ordering the destruction of one product and the offending labeling for the others [20]. However, many distributors continued to make false claims, including claims that Barley Green is effective against cancer. In November 2004, Day terminated her association with the original MLM company, which, by that time, was no longer selling Barley Green. Although she does not directly state that Barley Green is a cancer remedy, the statements on her Web site are still misleading. I do not believe there is any scientific evidence that Barley Green or any similar product can help rebuild and maintain a healthy immune system. In addition, it does not contain \"a multitude of enzymes necessary for digestion.\" In 2007, the FDA ordered Day to stop advertising that BetaBeet helps prevent cardiovascular disease [20]. Alternative Explanations? Are there other possible explanations for what happened to Dr. Day? The simplest possibility is that her cancer was not aggressive and was entirely removed by surgery, and that the rest of her problems were emotional. She withdrew from ordinary living for several years, during which time she spent many months in bed and was fearful, depressed, and in pain. Withdrawal is a symptom of major depression. She also exhibits grandiosity (\"I know more than other doctors\"), messianic feelings (\"I can cure the world\"), and unrealistic fears (all drugs are so dangerous that it pays to risk one's life to avoid them). She indicates that her methods developed through a combination of study, religious faith, revelation, and anonymous letters sent through the mail. Day appears to be absolutely certain that she is correct and\u2014in effect\u2014knows more than the vast majority of cancer specialists. This degree of certainty is not unusual among claimants to miraculous cures for serious diseases. These people often think clearly about most things but have a circumscribed set of beliefs that are not modifiable by contrary evidence. They may also go through a mental struggle that ends when their misbeliefs \"crystallize\" and stop interfering with day-to-day functioning. Psychiatrists refer to this phenomenon as a paranoid crystallization. That is my educated guess about what happened to Dr. Day. Day's 10-tape audio series, \"Conquering Confusion about your medical treatment,\" illustrates the expansive nature of her thinking. Throughout these tapes, she describes a conspiracy for world domination\u2014with roots going back over 200 years\u2014whose elements include the AIDS virus (created to reduce world population from 6 billion to 500 million); fluoridation; vaccination; food; the medical profession; television programming; computer games (used to program children); subliminal television messages; rock music (a basic \"beat\" was created to make young people \"susceptible to sex\"); the CIA; government-controlled food-management organizations; \"the Illuminati\" (who began working toward a new world order in 1776); the Rockefeller Foundation, the American Cancer Society; laser and DVD technology; television boxes (that can be used to spy on people) the Communist Manifesto (promoted by the U.S. Government); the news media (behind every story there is a plan controlled from a central source); rewriting of school textbooks; cover-up of the real killers of President John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Princess Diana, and Martin Luther King; \"diabolic plans for your health care\"; melting of the polar ice cap; and plans by National Aeronautic and Space Agency (NASA) to use rocket power to relocate the Earth further way from the Sun. To guard against these many alleged dangers, she advises everyone to stop watching commercial television (because after only a few minutes, watchers lose the ability to think rationally and resist the \"lies\" that permeate our society). She also states that cancer patients cannot get well if they work or watch television and that getting medical care and taking medication are a betrayal of God [3]. Do you think these are sane ideas? Promotion through Infomercials In 2004, ITV Direct began broadcasting a 30-minute television infomercial to sell Day's \"Cancer Doesn't Scare Me Anymore\" videotape. During the broadcast, company president Donald Barrett \"interviews\" Day who states that standard medical treatment for cancer never cures people and that Day's 10-step plan offers a better opportunity for recovery. Infomercial Watch has posted a detailed analysis of the infomercial transcript [21]. In December 2004, the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus concluded that the infomercial was misleading [22]. Anti-Semitic Involvement In September 2003, Day testified at a hearing concerning Ernst Z\u00fcndel, a hate propagandist whom Canada was trying to deport to Germany. Various sources indicate that Z\u00fcndel had for many years funded neo-Nazi groups and published anti-Semitic and Holocaust-denial tracts such as the 1977 book [The Hitler We Loved and Why](http://www.jrbooksonline.com/HTML-docs/hitlove.htm). [23-25]. ADL has described Z\u00fcndel as \"one of the largest distributors of Nazi and neo-Nazi propaganda and memorabilia in the world.\" [26] At the time of Day's involvement, Z\u00fcndel was detained in Toronto pending a Canadian Federal Court review of the government's declaration that he was a threat to national security, an order that would trigger removal to his native Germany, which had issued an arrest warrant for him [27]. [Z\u00fcndel's wife claimed that he had used herbs to cure himself of \"inoperable, terminal cancer](http://zgrams.zundelsite.org/pipermail/zgrams/2003-July/000551.html)\" many years previously but had had a recurrence because detention authorities would not permit him to continue taking them. Her Web site (Z\u00fcndelsite) listed Day among the signers of a [petition](http://zgrams.zundelsite.org/pipermail/zgrams/2003-May/000460.html) to government officials which asserted that, \"Mr. Zundel is an honest, outspoken man, and he does not deserve to be sent to Germany to face FIVE YEARS in prison merely because he has openly questioned the accuracy and veracity of what many claim to have been an historical occurence.\" Day testified that Zundel had cancer and high blood pressure and needed to be released from the detention center so that he could follow a non-drug treatment [28]. A week later, on the Jeff Rense Program, Day stated that she had been a friend of Zundel's wife for 13 years (many years before she married Z\u00fcndel) and that the Canadian authorities \"plan to kill him by neglect and keeping him under pressure.\" Day's effort to help Z\u00fcndel did not benefit him. In February 2005, Canadian Federal Court Justice Pierre Blais ruled that Z\u00fcndel could reasonably be described as a threat to Canada's security. In a scathing 63-page decision, Justice Blais described Z\u00fcndel as a hypocrite who cultivated a pacifist public image while guiding, aiding, and supporting neo-Nazi groups around the world, including some that \"propagate violent messages of hate\" and work to accomplish \"the destruction of governments and multicultural societies.\" A few weeks later, he was deported to Germany, where he was charged inciting racial hatred and defaming the memory of the dead. In 2007, he was convicted of 14 counts and sentenced to five years in prison, the maximum allowed under German law for those offenses. His obituary in the New York Times noted that he was released in 2010 and died August 5, 2017 at the age of 78 [29]. Day maintains an antisemitic Web site of her own that is filled with misinformation and hateful statements [30]. Vicious Lies about Me Day claims that after her second operation, her breast cancer recurred, doctors did a \"de-bulking\" operation and sent her home to die, but she cured herself with \"natural methods.\" She has never responded in an honest way to my skepticism. If her story is true, she should be able to produce medical records to document her assertion that\"grapefruit-sized mass\" was cancerous. Instead, however, she states that her medical records are \"private.\" I find it interesting that she displayed her bare breast in videos but says her surgical pathology report is too personal. Day has not been happy with my criticism. But instead of responding to a single word I have written, she has chosen instead to try to smear my reputation by posting a \"Response to Stephen Barrett\" page that links to 18 articles that contain false or misleading information about me. Most of these articles were written by Tim Bolen, a \"publicist\" who earns his living by helping \"alternative\" practitioners faced with regulatory action, criminal prosecution, or other matters that threaten their financial well-being and/or license to practice. Bolen's typical \"help\" consists of libeling regulators, consultants, and others who oppose what his clients do. Since 1999, he has posted false and defamatory statements about me to his Web sites and distributing them to others who do the same [31]. One of the 18 links states that I am \"de-licensed,\" which implies that I had my medical license taken away for wrongdoing. The simple fact is that I have never been subjected to discipline and merely retired from psychiatric practice in 1993 in order to have more time to write. I maintained an \"active-retired\" Pennsylvania license from 2006 through 2018, but neither Bolen nor Day has the slightest interest in writing accurately about me. Another of Day's links goes to an unidentified article from a chiropractic newspaper which stated that I was sued for \"racketeering.\" That lawsuit, which was filed in response to my libel suit against Bolen, was groundless and was dismissed in 2002. In 2011, Day added a lengthy analysis in which she (a) misrepresented what I have written in this article, (b) accuses me of illegally obtaining some of her medical records, and (c) claimed (falsely) that a judge rebuked me for \"false claims of being a psychiatrist\" and refused to allow me to be an expert witness [32]. The Bottom Line I do not know Day personally and have made no formal evaluation of her mental state. But based on what she has published and her refusal to make crucial medical records public, I do not believe she cured her cancer with diet or prayer. I strongly advise against following her advice.

Here are 30 signs that should arouse suspicion. 1. When Talking about Nutrients, They Tell Only Part of the Story. Quacks tell you all the wonderful things that vitamins and minerals do in your body and/or all the horrible things that can happen if you don't get enough. Many claim that their products or programs offer \"optimal nutritional support.\" But they conveniently neglect to tell you that a balanced diet provides the nutrients most people need and that government guidelines makes balancing your diet simple. 2.

How can quacks and vitamin pushers be recognized? Here are 30 signs that should arouse suspicion. 1. When Talking about Nutrients, They Tell Only Part of the Story. Quacks tell you all the wonderful things that vitamins and minerals do in your body and/or all the horrible things that can happen if you don't get enough. Many claim that their products or programs offer \"optimal nutritional support.\" But they conveniently neglect to tell you that a balanced diet provides the nutrients most people need and that government guidelines makes balancing your diet simple. 2. They Claim That Most Americans Are Poorly Nourished. This is an appeal to fear that is not only untrue, but ignores the fact that the main forms of bad nourishment in the United States are obesity in the population at large (particularly the poor) and undernourishment among the poverty-stricken. Poor people can ill afford to waste money on unnecessary vitamin pills. Their food money should be spent on nourishing food. It is falsely alleged that Americans are so addicted to \"junk\" foods that an adequate diet is exceptional rather than usual. While it is true that some snack foods are mainly \"naked calories\" (sugars and/or fats without other nutrients), it is not necessary for every morsel of food we eat to be loaded with nutrients. In fact, no normal person following the [Dietary Guidelines for Americans](https://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2005/document/default.htm) is in any danger of vitamin deficiency. 3. They Recommend \"Nutrition Insurance\" for Everyone. Most vitamin pushers suggest that everyone is in danger of deficiency and should therefore take supplements as \"insurance.\" Some suggest that it is difficult to get what you need from food, while others claim that it is impossible. Their pitch resembles that of the door-to-door huckster who states that your perfectly good furnace is in danger of blowing up unless you replace it with his product. Vitamin pushers will never tell you who doesn't need their products. Their \"be wary of deficiency\" claims may not be limited to essential nutrients. It can also include nonessential chemicals that nobody needs to worry about because the body makes its own supply. 4. They Say That Most Diseases Are Due to Faulty Diet and Can Be Treated with \"Nutritional\" Methods. This simply isn't so. Consult your doctor or any recognized textbook of medicine. They will tell you that although diet is a factor in some diseases (most notably coronary heart disease), most diseases have little or nothing to do with diet. Common symptoms like malaise (feeling poorly), fatigue, lack of pep, aches (including headaches) or pains, insomnia, and similar complaints are usually the body's reaction to emotional stress. The persistence of such symptoms is a signal to see a doctor to be evaluated for possible physical illness. It is not a reason to take vitamin pills. 5. They Allege That Modern Processing Methods and Storage Remove all Nutritive Value from Our Food. It is true that food processing can change the nutrient content of foods. But the changes are not so drastic as the quack, who wants you to buy supplements, would like you to believe. While some processing methods destroy some nutrients, others add them. A balanced variety of foods will provide all the nourishment you need. Quacks distort and oversimplify. When they say that milling removes B-vitamins, they don't bother to tell you that enrichment puts them back. When they tell you that cooking destroys vitamins, they omit the fact that only a few vitamins are sensitive to heat. Nor do they tell you that these vitamins are easily obtained by consuming a portion of fresh uncooked fruit, vegetable, or fresh or frozen fruit juice each day. Any claims that minerals are destroyed by processing or cooking are pure lies. Heat does not destroy minerals. 6. They Claim That Diet Is a Major Factor in Behavior. Food quacks relate diet not only to disease but to behavior. Some claim that adverse reactions to additives and/or common foods cause hyperactivity in children and even criminal behavior in adolescents and adults. These claims are based on a combination of delusions, anecdotal evidence, and poorly designed research. 7. They Claim That Fluoridation Is Dangerous. Curiously, quacks are not always interested in real deficiencies. Fluoride is necessary to build decay-resistant teeth and strong bones. The best way to obtain adequate amounts of this important nutrient is to augment community water supplies so their fluoride concentration is about one part fluoride for every million parts of water. But [quacks usually oppose water fluoridation](../../03HealthPromotion/fluoride.html), and some advocate water filters that remove fluoride. It seems that when they cannot profit from something, they may try to make money by opposing it. 8. They Claim That Soil Depletion and the Use of Pesticides and \"Chemical\" Fertilizers Result in Food That Is Less Safe and Less Nourishing. These claims are used to promote the sale of so-called \"organically grown\" foods. If an essential nutrient is missing from the soil, a plant simply doesn't grow. Chemical fertilizers counteract the effects of soil depletion. Quacks also lie when they claim that plants grown with natural fertilizers (such as manure) are nutritionally superior to those grown with synthetic fertilizers. Before they can use them, plants convert natural fertilizers into the same chemicals that synthetic fertilizers supply. The vitamin content of a food is determined by its genetic makeup. Fertilizers can influence the levels of certain minerals in plants, but this is not a significant factor in the American diet. The pesticide residue of our food supply is extremely small and poses no health threat to the consumer. Foods \"certified\" as \"organic\" are not safer or more nutritious than other foods. In fact, except for their high price, they are not significantly different. 9. They Claim You Are in Danger of Being \"Poisoned\" by Ordinary Food Additives and Preservatives. This is another scare tactic designed to undermine your confidence in food scientists and government protection agencies as well as our food supply itself. Quacks want you to think they are out to protect you. They hope that if you trust them, you will buy their \"natural\" food products. The fact is that the tiny amounts of additives used in food pose no threat to human health. Some actually protect our health by preventing spoilage, rancidity, and mold growth. 10. They Charge That the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) Have Been Set Too Low. The RDAs have been published by the National Research Council approximately every five years since 1943. They are defined as \"the levels of intake of essential nutrients that, on the basis of scientific knowledge, are judged by the Food and Nutrition Board to be adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of practically all healthy persons.\" Neither the RDAs nor the Daily Values listed on food labels are \"minimums\" or \"requirements.\" They are deliberately set higher than most people need. The reason quacks charge that the RDAs are too low is obvious: if you believe you need more than can be obtained from food, you are more likely to buy supplements. 11. They Claim That under Everyday Stress, and in Certain Diseases, Your Need for Nutrients Is Increased. Many vitamin manufacturers have advertised that \"stress robs the body of vitamins.\" One company has asserted that, \"if you smoke, diet, or happen to be sick, you may be robbing your body of vitamins.\" Another has warned that \"stress can deplete your body of water-soluble vitamins . . . and daily replacement is necessary.\" Other products are touted to fill the \"special needs of athletes.\" While it is true that the need for vitamins may rise slightly under physical stress and in certain diseases, this type of advertising is fraudulent. The average American\u2014stressed or not\u2014is not in danger of vitamin deficiency. The increased needs to which the ads refer are not higher than the amounts obtainable by proper eating. Someone who is really in danger of deficiency due to an illness would be very sick and would need medical care, probably in a hospital. But these promotions are aimed at average Americans who certainly don't need vitamin supplements to survive the common cold, a round of golf, or a jog around the neighborhood! Athletes get more than enough vitamins when they eat the food needed to meet their caloric requirements. Many vitamin pushers suggest that smokers need vitamin C supplements. Although it is true that smokers in North America have somewhat lower blood levels of this vitamin, these levels are still far above deficiency levels. In America, cigarette smoking is the leading cause of death preventable by self-discipline. Rather than seeking false comfort by taking vitamin C, smokers who are concerned about their health should stop smoking. Suggestions that \"stress vitamins\" are helpful against emotional stress are also fraudulent. 12. They Recommend \"Supplements\" and \"Health Foods\" for Everyone. Food quacks belittle normal foods and ridicule the food-group systems of good nutrition. They may not tell you they earn their living from such pronouncements\u2014via public appearance fees, product endorsements, sale of publications, or financial interests in vitamin companies, health-food stores, or organic farms. The very term \"health food\" is a deceptive slogan. Judgments about individual foods should take into account how they contribute to an individual's overall diet. All food is health food in moderation; any food is junk food in excess. Did you ever stop to think that your corner grocery, fruit market, meat market, and supermarket are also health-food stores? They are\u2014and they generally charge less than stores that use the slogan. By the way, have you ever wondered why people who eat lots of \"health foods\" still feel they must load themselves up with vitamin supplements? Or why so many \"health food\" shoppers complain about ill health? 13. They Claim That \"Natural\" Vitamins are Better than \"Synthetic\" Ones. This claim is a flat lie. Each vitamin is a chain of atoms strung together as a molecule. With minor exception, molecules made in the \"factories\" of nature are identical to those made in the factories of chemical companies. Does it make sense to pay extra for vitamins extracted from foods when you can get all you need from the foods themselves? 14. They Suggest That a Questionnaire Can Be Used to Indicate Whether You Need Dietary Supplements. No questionnaire can do this. A few entrepreneurs have devised lengthy computer-scored questionnaires with questions about symptoms that could be present if a vitamin deficiency exists. But such symptoms occur much more frequently in conditions unrelated to nutrition. Even when a deficiency actually exists, the tests don't provide enough information to discover the cause so that suitable treatment can be recommended. That requires a physical examination and appropriate laboratory tests. Many responsible nutritionists use a computer to help evaluate their clients' diet. But this is done to make dietary recommendations, such as reducing fat content or increasing fiber content. Supplements are seldom necessary unless the person is unable (or unwilling) to consume an adequate diet. Be wary, too, of questionnaires purported to determine whether supplements are needed to correct \"nutrient deficiencies\" or \"dietary inadequacies\" or to design \"customized\" supplements. These questionnaires are scored so that everyone who takes the test is advised to take supplements. Responsible dietary analyses compare the individual's average daily food consumption with the recommended numbers of servings from each food group. The safest and best way to get nutrients is generally from food, not pills. So even if a diet is deficient, the most prudent action is usually diet modification rather than supplementation with pills. 15. They Say It Is Easy to Lose Weight. Diet quacks would like you to believe that special pills or food combinations can cause \"effortless\" weight loss. But the only way to lose weight is to burn off more calories than you eat. This requires self-discipline: eating less, exercising more, or preferably doing both. There are about 3,500 calories in a pound of body weight. To lose one pound a week (a safe amount that is not just water), you must eat about 500 fewer calories per day than you burn up. The most sensible diet for losing weight is one that is nutritionally balanced in carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Most fad diets \"work\" by producing temporary weight loss\u2014as a result of calorie restriction. But they are invariably too monotonous and are often too dangerous for long-term use. Unless a dieter develops and maintains better eating and exercise habits, weight lost on a diet will soon return. The term \"cellulite\" is sometimes used to describe the dimpled fat found on the hips and thighs of many women. Although no medical evidence supports the claim, cellulite is represented as a special type of fat that is resistant to diet and exercise. Sure-fire [cellulite remedies](https://quackwatch.org/related/cellulite/) include creams (to \"dissolve\" it), brushes, rollers, \"loofah\" sponges, body wraps, and vitamin-mineral supplements with or without herbs. The cost of various treatment plans runs from a few dollars for a bottle of vitamins to many hundreds of dollars at a salon that offers heat treatments, massage, enzyme injections, and/or treatment with various gadgets. The simple truth about \"cellulite\" is that it is ordinary fat that can be lost only as part of an overall reducing program. 16. They Claim to Have a Better Overall Approach to Health Care Many quacks refer to their practices as \"alternative,\" \"complementary,\" \"integrative\" \"functional,\" \"holistic,\" \"biological,\" and/or \"advanced.\" These marketing terms falsely suggest that they offer more than the science-based medical community. 17. They Claim to Treat the \"Root Cause\" of Your Health Problems Many quacks promise to locate and treat the underlying cause(s) of whatever health problems you have. In addition to nutrient deficiencies, the current favorite include hidden allergies, chemical sensitivity, heavy metal toxicity, yeast infections, molds, (\"candida\"), Lyme disease, hormonal imbalances, energy blockages, and misaligned spinal bones (the chiropractic favorite). The \"root cause\" tactic serves several purposes. First, it implies that standard health care will fail because it is a superficial approach. Second, it enable quacks to profit from selling one alleged treatment after another to virtually everyone who believes them. 18. They Promise Quick, Dramatic, Miraculous Results. Often the promises are subtle or couched in \"weasel words\" that create an illusion of a promise, so promoters can deny making them when the \"feds\" close in. False promises of cure are the quacks' most immoral practice. They don't seem to care how many people they break financially or in spirit\u2014by elation over their expected good fortune followed by deep depression when the \"treatment\" fails. Nor do quacks keep count\u2014while they fill their bank accounts\u2014of how many people they lure away from effective medical care into disability or death. Quacks will tell you that \"megavitamins\" (huge doses of vitamins) can prevent or cure many different ailments, particularly emotional ones. But they won't tell you that the \"evidence\" supporting such claims is unreliable because it is based on inadequate investigations, anecdotes, or testimonials. Nor do quacks inform you that megadoses may be harmful. Megavitamin therapy (also called [orthomolecular therapy](https://quackwatch.org/related/ortho/)) is nutritional roulette; and only the house makes the profit. 19. They Routinely Sell Vitamins and Other \"Dietary Supplements\" as Part of Their Practice. Although vitamins are useful as therapeutic agents for certain health problems, the number of such conditions is small. Practitioners who sell supplements in their offices invariably recommend them inappropriately. In addition, such products tend to be substantially more expensive than similar ones in drugstores\u2014or even health-food stores. You should also disregard any publication or Web site whose editor or publisher sells dietary supplements. 20. They Use Disclaimers Couched in Pseudomedical Jargon. Instead of promising to cure your disease, some quacks will promise to \"detoxify,\" \"purify,\" \"revitalize,\" or \"energize\" your body; \"balance\" its bring it in with nature; \"stimulate\" or \"strengthen\" your immune system; \"support\" in your body; \"unlock your body's healing ability\"; or stimulate your body's power to heal itself. Of course, they never identify or make valid before-and-after measurements of any of these processes. These disclaimers serve two purposes. First, since it is impossible to measure the processes quacks allege, it may be difficult to prove them wrong. Moreover, if a quack is not a physician, the use of nonmedical terminology may help to avoid prosecution for practicing medicine without a license\u2014although it shouldn't. Many marketers of dietary supplements and herbal products use similar language to describe the purposes of their products. The \"boost-your-immune-system\" claim is especially noteworthy when applied to allergies and to autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis. In these conditions, immune mechaisms go awry and attack the body's own cells. If the supposed treatment could actually enhance immue function, it would make these conditions worse! Some approaches to [\"detoxification\"](gastro.html) are based on notions that, as a result of intestinal stasis, intestinal contents putrefy, and toxins are formed and absorbed, which causes chronic poisoning of the body. This \"autointoxication\" theory was popular around the turn of the century but was abandoned by the scientific community during the 1930s. No such \"toxins\" have ever been found, and careful observations have shown that individuals in good health can vary greatly in bowel habits. Quacks may also suggest that fecal material collects on the lining of the intestine and causes trouble unless removed by laxatives, colonic irrigation, special diets, and/or various herbs or food supplements that \"cleanse\" the body. The falsity of this notion is obvious to doctors who perform intestinal surgery or peer within the large intestine with a diagnostic instrument. Fecal material does not adhere to the intestinal lining. Colonic irrigation is done by inserting a tube into the rectum and pumping up to 20 gallons of water in and out. This type of enema is not only therapeutically worthless but can cause fatal electrolyte imbalance. Cases of death due to intestinal perforation and infection (from contaminated equipment) have also been reported. 21. They Claim to Use or Mobilize Healing Forces That Are Not Recognized by Science Many quacks claim they can cure diseases by mobilizing healing forces with a device. They typically claim that all cells vibrate with specific \"frequencies\" that their device can counter with healing frequencies. Some even claim that this process can be done through telephone lines or via the Internet. Since the forces they claim to mobilize cannot be detected by scientific instruments, it is safe to assume they do not exist. 22. They Use Anecdotes and Testimonials to Support Their Claims. We all tend to believe what others tell us about personal experiences. But separating cause and effect from coincidence can be difficult. If people tell you that product X has cured their cancer, arthritis, or whatever, be skeptical. They may not actually have had the condition. If they did, their recovery most likely would have occurred without the help of product X. Most single episodes of disease end with just the passage of time, and most chronic ailments have symptom-free periods. Establishing medical truths requires careful and repeated investigation\u2014with well-designed experiments, not reports of coincidences misperceived as cause-and-effect. That's why [ testimonial evidence](https://quackwatch.org/related/scivsalt/) is forbidden in scientific articles, is usually inadmissible in court, and is not used to evaluate whether or not drugs should be legally marketable. (Imagine what would happen if the FDA decided that clinical trials were too expensive and therefore drug approval would be based on testimonial letters or interviews with a few patients.) Anecdotes (reports of individual experiences) occasionally provide suggestions about what might be worth studying. As an anonymous commenter to a blog said recently: \"Anecdotes are how you start research\u2014not how you finish it.\" Never underestimate the extent to which people can be fooled by a worthless remedy. During the early 1940s, many thousands of people became convinced that \"glyoxylide\" could cure cancer. Yet analysis showed that it was simply distilled water! [1]. Many years before that, when arsenic was used as a \"tonic,\" countless numbers of people swore by it even as it slowly poisoned them. Symptoms that are psychosomatic (bodily reactions to tension) are often relieved by anything taken with a suggestion that it will work. Tiredness and other minor aches and pains may respond to any enthusiastically recommended nostrum. For these problems, even physicians may prescribe a placebo. A placebo is a substance that has no pharmacological effect on the condition for which it is used, but is given to satisfy a patient who supposes it to be a medicine. Vitamins (such as B12 shots) are commonly used in this way. Placebos act by suggestion. Unfortunately, some doctors swallow the advertising hype or become confused by their own observations and \"believe in vitamins\" beyond those supplied by a good diet. Those who share such false beliefs do so because they confuse coincidence or placebo action with cause and effect. Homeopathic believers make the same error. Remember, too, that anecdotes and testimonials may be complete fabrications\u2014stories simply made up for marketing purposes\u2014and that the people to whom they are attributed may not even exist,\u00e5 23. They Claim That Sugar Is a Deadly Poison. Many vitamin pushers would have us believe that refined (white) sugar is \"the killer on the breakfast table\" and is the underlying cause of everything from heart disease to hypoglycemia. This is a gross exaggeration. [Excess sugar can contribute to the development or worsening of heart disease and several other health problems and should be avoided](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/added-sugars). However, that when sugar is used in moderation as part of a sensible balanced diet, it is a safe source of calories and eating pleasure. Sugar is alao factor in the tooth decay process, but what counts is not merely the amount of sugar in the diet but how long any digestible carbohydrate remains in contact with the teeth. This, in turn, depends on such factors as the stickiness of the food, the type of bacteria on the teeth, and the extent of oral hygiene practiced by the individual. 24. They Display Credentials Not Recognized by Responsible Scientists or Educators. The backbone of educational integrity in America is a system of [accreditation](http://www.ed.gov/offices/OPE/Students/file01.html) by agencies recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education or the Council on Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), which is a nongovernmental coordinating agency. \"Degrees\" from nonaccredited schools are rarely worth the paper they are printed on. In the health field, no nonaccredited school can qualify people to give trustworthy advice. Also note that some nonaccredited schools set up their own non-recognized accrediting bodies. Unfortunately, possession of an accredited degree does not guarantee reliability. Some schools that teach unscientific methods (chiropractic, naturopathy, acupuncture, and even quack nutritional methods) have achieved accreditation. Worse yet, a small percentage of individuals trained in reputable institutions (such as medical or dental schools or accredited universities) have strayed from scientific thought. Since quacks operate outside of the scientific community, they also tend to form their own \"professional\" organizations. In some cases, the only membership requirement is payment of a fee. We and others we know have secured fancy \"professional member\" certificates for household pets by merely submitting the pet's name, address, and a check for $50 [2]. Don't assume that all groups with scientific-sounding names are respectable. Find out whether their views are scientifically based. Also note that groups that promiote nonstandard treatment often set up a certifying board so that their members can claim to be board-certified. Some quacks are promoted with superlatives like \"the world's foremost nutritionist\" or \"America's leading nutrition expert.\" There is no law against this tactic, just as there is none against calling oneself the \"World's Foremost Lover.\" However, the scientific community recognizes no such titles. The designation \"Nobel Prize Nominee\" is also bogus and can be assumed to mean that someone has either nominated himself or had a close associate do so. Some entrepreneurs claim to have degrees and/or affiliations to schools, hospitals, and/or professional groups that actually don't exist. The modern champion of this approach appears to be the late [Gregory E. Caplinger](https://quackwatch.org/related/cancer/immustim/), who claimed to have acquired a medical degree, specialty training, board certification, and scores of professional affiliations\u2014all from bogus or nonexistent sources. A few organizations even issue \"licenses\" that lack government recogition. The most noteworthy of these is the [Pastoral Medical Association (PMA](http://www.credentialwatch.org/reports/pma/overview.shtml)), which \"licenses\" practitioners and registers prospective patients as \"members\" who wish to receive care from these providers. Encouraged by PMSA, hundreds of practitioners are using the credentials \"PSc.D.,\" \"D.PSc.,\" and/or \"Doctor of Pastoral Medicine\" to promote their services [3]. Even legitimate credentials can be used to mislead. The American Medical Association's \"Physician's Recognition Award\" requires participation in 150 hours of continuing education over a three-year period and payment of a small fee. Most practicing physicians meet this educational standard because it is necessary to study to keep up-to-date. Accredited hospitals require this amount of continuing education to maintain staff privileges, and some states require it for license renewal. However, most physicians who do this don't bother to get the AMA certificate. Since the award reflects no special accomplishment or expertise, using it for promotional purposes is not appropriate behavior. 25. They Offer to Determine Your Body's Nutritional State with an Invalid Test or a Questionnaire. Various health-food industry members and unscientific practitioners utilize tests that they claim can determine your body's nutritional state and\u2014of course\u2014what products you should buy from them. One favorite method is [hair analysis](https://quackwatch.org/related/hair-2/). For $35 to $75 plus a lock of your hair, you can get an elaborate computer printout of vitamins and minerals you supposedly need. Hair analysis has limited value (mainly in forensic medicine) in the diagnosis of heavy metal poisoning, but it is worthless as a screening device to detect nutritional problems [4]. If a hair analysis laboratory recommends supplements, you can be sure that its computers are programmed to recommend them to everyone. Other tests used to hawk supplements include amino acid analysis of urine, muscle-testing ( [applied kinesiology](https://quackwatch.org/related/tests/ak/)), [iridology](https://quackwatch.org/related/iridology/), [live-cell analysis](https://quackwatch.org/related/tests/livecell/) analysis, vital hematology, and biocytonics), [some genetic testing](https://quackwatch.org/related/tests/genomics/), blood typing, \"nutrient-deficiency\" and/or lifestyle questionnaires, and [\"electrodiagnostic\" gadgets](electro.html). 26. They Diagnose Their Favorite Diseases in Virtually Everyone Who Consults. At least 25 diagnostic labels classifiable as fads have been in vogue during the past fifty years [5]. Some unscientific practitioners apply one or more of these diagnoses to almost every patient they see. The common ones include adrenal fatigue, candidiasis hypersensitivity, hypothyroidism, \"leaky even \"magnetic deficiency.\" [5] Some refer to actual disease (which the patients do not have), whereas others are not recognized by the scientific community. In many cases, nonstandard tests are used to \"diagnose\" them and recommend \"dietary supplements,\" \"detoxification,\" and/or various procedures to treat them. A small percentage of physicians and large percentages of chiropractors, naturopaths, acupuncturists, and bogus \"nutritionists\" are involved in this process. Others may also profit by selling educational materials promoting these alleged conditions and supplement concoctions claimed to help them. 27. They Claim They Are Being Persecuted by Orthodox Medicine and That Their Work Is Being Suppressed Because It's Controversial. The \"conspiracy charge\" is an attempt to gain sympathy by portraying the quack as an \"underdog.\" Quacks typically claim that the American Medical Association is against them because their cures would cut into the incomes that doctors make by keeping people sick. Don't fall for such nonsense! Reputable physicians are plenty busy. Moreover, many doctors engaged in prepaid health plans, group practice, full-time teaching, and government service receive the same salary whether or not their patients are sick\u2014so keeping their patients healthy reduces their workload, not their income. Quacks also claim there is a \"controversy\" about facts between themselves and \"the bureaucrats,\" organized medicine, or \"the establishment.\" They clamor for medical examination of their claims, but ignore any evidence that refutes them. The gambit \"Do you believe in vitamins?\" is another tactic used to increase confusion. Everyone knows that vitamins are needed by the human body. The real question is \"Do you need additional vitamins beyond those in a well-balanced diet?\" [For most people, the answer is no](../../03HealthPromotion/supplements.html). Nutrition is a science, not a religion. It is based upon matters of fact, not questions of belief. Any physician who found a vitamin or other preparation that could cure sterility, heart disease, arthritis, cancer, or the like, could make an enormous fortune. Patients would flock to such a doctor (as they now do to those who falsely claim to cure such problems), and colleagues would shower the doctor with awards\u2014including the extremely lucrative Nobel Prize! And don't forget, doctors get sick, too. Do you believe they would conspire to suppress cures for diseases that also afflict them and their loved ones? When polio was conquered, iron lungs became virtually obsolete, but nobody resisted this advancement because it would force hospitals to change. And neither will scientists mourn the eventual defeat of cancer. 28. They Claim to Have Scoured the World to Find What Works Some promoters tell stories about how, when they or a loved one got sick, they traveled throughout the world and found a cure. Such stories imply that \"unknown\" or \"secret\" cures exist if you only look hard enough for them. Think about it. If anyone knew of such a cure, why wouldn't they want to share them and the fame, fortune, and good feelings that wiould come from sharing them? 29. They Warn You Not to Trust Your Doctor. Quacks, who want you to trust them, suggest that most doctors are \"butchers\" and \"poisoners.\" They exaggerate the shortcomings of our healthcare delivery system, but completely disregard their own\u2014and those of other quacks. For the same reason, quacks also claim that doctors are nutrition illiterates. This, too, is untrue. The principles of nutrition are those of human biochemistry and physiology, courses required in every medical school. Some medical schools don't teach a separate required course labeled \"Nutrition\" because the subject is included in other courses at the points where it is most relevant. For example, nutrition in growth and development is taught in pediatrics, nutrition in wound healing is taught in surgery, and nutrition in pregnancy is covered in obstetrics. In addition, many medical schools do offer separate instruction in nutrition. A physician's training, of course, does not end on the day of graduation from medical school or completion of specialty training. The medical profession advocates lifelong education, and some states require it for license renewal. Physicians can further their knowledge of nutrition by reading medical journals and textbooks, discussing cases with colleagues, and attending continuing education courses. Most doctors know what nutrients can and cannot do and can tell the difference between a real nutritional discovery and a piece of quack nonsense. Those who are unable to answer questions about dietetics (meal planning) can refer patients to someone who can\u2014usually a registered dietitian. Like all human beings, doctors sometimes make mistakes. However, quacks deliver mistreatment most of the time. 30. They Encourage Patients to Crusade for Their Treatment Methods. A century ago, before scientific methodology was generally accepted, valid new ideas were hard to evaluate and were sometimes rejected by a majority of the medical community, only to be upheld later. But today, treatments demonstrated as effective are welcomed by scientific practitioners and do not need a group to crusade for them. Quacks seek political endorsement because they can't prove that their methods work. Instead, they may seek to legalize their treatment and force insurance companies to pay for it. One of the surest signs that a treatment doesn't work is a political campaign to protect the practitioners who are using it.

American College of Physicians news release, Sept 9, 2021] Dr. Sherri Tenpenny's COVID-19 misinformation gospel spotlighted. A Religion News Service report describes how Sherri Tenpenny, an osteopathic doctor from Cleveland, Ohio, appeals to Christian nationalism in promoting COVID-19 misinformation: - In testimony in June before Ohio legislators, she claimed COVID-19 vaccines could \"magnetize\" people's bodies or allow them to \"interface\" with cellphone towers. She also said: \"For those of you who say you are Christians, what will your life review look like at the end of your life? Will the Lord say to you: 'You coerced people into being injected with this gene-modification technology that irreversibly disrupts your chromosomes?'\" - In one session of her \"Happy Hour with Dr. T,\" a semiweekly Bible study on Instagram Live, she \"implores God to release the U.S. from the 'tyranny of the mask,'\" argues America is founded \"on your word,\" and expresses hope it will \"return\" to being \"one country under God.\" In another session, she refers to vaccines as a \"bioweapon to damage your children\" created by \"Satanists\" who allow Black Lives Matter and antifa activists to operate as a \"front\" to \"drive socialism through the heart of America, which turns into communism.\" - In August at Bards Fest, a Christian nationalist gathering in St. Louis she: (a) claimed the shots have no medical benefit, make people sick and amount to a \"sin\" because getting one involves \"bowing to fear\"; (b) said: \"How many stories are in the Bible about (Jesus) healing leprosy? Leprosy back in the day, when Jesus was alive, was an incurable deadly disease. Don't you think he might be able to take care of you in COVID, too?\"; and (c) framed vaccine proponents as murderous descendants of the biblical Nimrod. [Jenkins J.

[Hide Full Content](#thirty-one-thousand-eight-hundred-twenty-four) [Don't Pay or Contract in Advance for Chiropractic Visits at a \"Discount\" Price](https://quackwatch.org/chiropractic/strategy/contracts/) Many chiropractors offer contracts under which patients pay in advance or agree to pay for many visits at a \"discount\" price. I have seen contracts for as many as 100 visits. Chiropractors who offer them typically tell all patients that long-term care is needed to prevent recurrence, spinal degeneration, or various serious diseases. Some chiropractors display a chart of \"subluxation degeneration\" or \"spinal decay\" that they say is inevitable without intensive and/or long-term care. Some tell nearly all of their patients that the curvature of their neck needs to be changed. All such advice represents overselling. Even if chiropractic treatment can legitimately help a problem, it is not possible to know in advance that a large specified number of visits will be needed. In addition ... Many chiropractors offer contracts under which patients pay in advance or agree to pay for many visits at a \"discount\" price. I have seen contracts for as many as 100 visits. Chiropractors who offer them typically tell all patients that long-term care is needed to prevent recurrence, spinal degeneration, or various serious diseases. Some chiropractors display a chart of \" [subluxation degeneration](/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/quackwatch/chirobase/06DD/subluxation_degeneration.pdf)\" or \"spinal decay\" that they say is inevitable without intensive and/or long-term care. Some tell nearly all of their patients that the curvature of their neck needs to be changed. All such advice represents overselling. Even if chiropractic treatment can legitimately help a problem, it is not possible to know in advance that a large specified number of visits will be needed. In addition to excessive visits, contracts often contain provisions intended to discourage quitting. Some say that if treatment is stopped before all of the visits are used, the discount will be canceled and visits used will be figured at their \"full\" price. Some contracts also call for an \"administrative fee\" for early stoppage. Payment Arrangements Three types of payment arrangements are common: - Installment payments to the chiropractor - Advance patient to the chiropractor - Use of a \"health care credit card\" in which the chiropractor gets paid by a loan company and the patient is obliged to repay the loan company Installment payments pose the least risk because patients who stop \"early\" are unlikely to be forced to pay for more services than they have received. The amount of money is usually too small to make a lawsuit practical, and failure to pay medical bills will not affect a person's credit rating. Full advance payment is more risky because if the chiropractor refuses to make an appropriate refund for unused services, it may be difficult to obtain one. Third-party financing through a credit agency is very dangerous because no matter what happens between the patient and the chiropractor, the patient remains legally bound to repay the loan and failure to repay can seriously damage a person's credit rating. Many chiropractors encourage patients to finance the contracted amount through CareCredit, a company that pays the chiropractor (minus a small fee) upfront and then collects from the patients. The process is typically described as an interest-free loan or interest-free credit plan. However, if payments are late, the interest and other fees can be very high. Some patients are led to believe that the chiropractor was simply extending credit with a payment plan. However, the CareCredit plan is a \"non-recourse\" loan from what the law would regard as an independent loan company [1]. The worst contract I have seen included a provision that the patient is responsible for any legal fees incurred by chiropractor for collection of any unpaid balances. That means that if they wind up in court and the patient loses, the patient could be faced with a large legal bill. Contract-Related Legal and Regulatory Actions In 2000, J. Mitchell Adolph, D.C., signed a consent order with the Maryland State Board of Chiropractic Examiners under which he agreed to (a) pay a $10,000 fine, (b) surrender his license until he passed a examination and completed board-approved courses in ethics (25 hours) and recordkeeping (12 hours), (c) perform 100 hours of community service, and (d) when his license was restored, engage a monitor who would supervise his practice for two years. Among other things, the order noted that he had treated six symptom-free patients without clinical justification, recommended excessive manipulations for maintenance care, and required patients to pay for extended treatment before determining that they needed it [2]. In 2001, The New York State Board for Chiropractic found Frank J. Amato, D.C., guilty of exerting undue influence on a patient for his own financial gain by placing pressure on the patient to bring family members into the office for examination, evaluation and treatment by him. During the discussions, Amato offered a contract for 72 visits with substantial discounts if other fanily members were to enter treatment. Amato was also criticized for holding a \"Patient of the Month\" contest in which the patient who recommended the most new patients to the practice would win a color television set [3]. In 2008, in response to complaints from patients, the Maryland Board of Chiropractic and Massage Therapy Examiners advised chiropractors not to use \"extended treatment contracts\": A licensee is free to use whatever patient contract he/she desires provided that the contract is clear, fair, and may be terminated at any time for any reason, without penalty by the patient. If a contract unduly restricts a patient to commit for extended periods of treatment requiring penalties for termination, the contract is unconscionable and considered as unprofessional conduct by the Board. Licensees must carefully assess binding a patient to an extended care contract since parameters of care, patient health and patient desires change as time goes by. For example, a patient may simply not like the personality or treatment methods of the licensee. In such cases, the patient must have the free, unfettered and unobstructed right to terminate the patient care contract for any reason and at any time without penalty. The Board has received numerous complaints from patients regarding the unfair use of such contracts. For these reasons, the Board strongly advises licensees to refrain from the use of long-term, extended treatment contracts. During the same year, the Maryland Board issued a consent order that placed Andrew Joyce, D.C. on probation for three years, fined him $9,000, and required that his practice be monitored. The order described how Joyce had contracted to provide long courses of treatment but failed to adequately document the need for the treatment, what took place during many of the visits, the patient's status at each visit, and what treatments were administered during each visit. The board also found many improprieties in Joyce's insurance billings [4]. In 2007, the Kansas State Board of Healing Arts charged Bradley Eck, D.C., of Wichita, Kansas, with unprofessional conduct. The complaint stated that he engaged in deceptive advertising and used improper contracts under which patients paid \"discount\" prices in advance for multiple visits but would receive no refund for visits that were not used [5]. In February 2009, the case was settled with a [consent order](https://centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/quackwatch/chirobase/board/chiro/eck/consent.pdf) under which Eck must pay investigative costs plus a $5,000 fine; serve probation for two years; and provide full refunds to patients listed in the complaint who did not receive all of the treatments for which they contracted [6]. That same month, a small claims court judge voided the contracts between chiropractor Donald Harte and two former patients who sued Harte in Marin County, California. Gertrude West, a retired attorney, had sought help for knee pain but was advised to have intensive care for \"subluxation degeneration\" of her spine. She contracted for 100 visits with a discount for advance payment but severe penalties for discontinuing. After 49 visits over a 4-month period, she concluded that she was not being helped and asked that payment for the unused visits be refunded. When Harte refused, she filed suit. The judge concluded that (a) West had been misled, (b) the penalty clause was \"unconscionable,\" and (c) West was entitled to a $6,401 refund, plus the cost of the suit [7]. The other former patient, Victoria Pollock-Grasso of Tiburon, objected to Harte charging a $559 \"administrative fee\" when she decided to stop seeing him. Grasso said she stopped because an orthopedist she consulted for a second opinion said she had degenerative disc disease in her cervical spine and that Harte's manipulation of her neck could cause her to have a stroke [8]. Harte appealed the West ruling, asserting that the contract was enforceable and that he was entitled to reasonable compensation for services rendered. The small claims appeal judge reduced the award to $4,589.00 plus costs of $75.00. The judge did not explain how he decided what was \"reasonable,\" but he clearly agreed that the contract was not. Documents from the case show how Harte used scare tactics. His \"report of findings\" is a pre-printed form with fill-in sections such as: - \"Dysautonomia: mild | moderate | severe | very severe.\" In this area Harte checked \"severe\" and penned in the words \"May get worse.\" - \"Diseases you have, apparent or not , diseases that are in the process of developing, and every aspect of your . . . body function that is operating at less than optimal level. Unknown diseases? - \"Pathological changes in the spine itself, from years of VSC: Subluxation Degeneration.\" The bottom of the form contains \"recommendations for initial intensive care,\" with blanks to fill in the number of visits per week, and a statement that the speed and degree of eventual recovery are influenced by consistency in following the recommendations. The contract called for 92 regular visits at $97 each ($55 Medicare discount price) and 8 \"progressive examination visits\" @ $250 each\u2014said to be a total value of $7,080 for a discount price of $6,354 if paid in advance. It goes on to say, however, that if care is stopped before completion, services will be charged at regular prices and a 10% \"administrative fee\" would be added. In 2009, the Minnesota Attorney General and Minnesota Board of Chiropractic Examiners filed a lawsuit accusing Express Health of Lakeville, Minnesota and its owner Cory Couillard, D.C. of engaging in predatory lending practices [9,10]. The suit alleged: - The sales process often began with free health or spinal screening at a public location where it was recommended that they undergo a \"full\" office evaluation. - After the full evaluation, patients were typically told that without extensive treatment, they were headed for serious health problems. - Couillard and his clinic aggressively enrolled patients in the CareCredit Credit Card offered by GE Money Bank, convincing some patients to complete applications by telling them that they were not applying for a credit card but that the clinic simply wanted to check to see if they would qualify for credit. - Unbeknown to these patients, Express Health and Couillard then submitted the application to the Bank, which issued a CareCredit credit card in the patient's name. In order to ensure that patients qualified for a credit card, the defendants sometimes submitted to the lender false annual income for patients, in some cases doubling or more patients' actual income. - Once patients were issued a credit card, the defendants placed lump-sum charges of up to $5,040 on the credit card, without patients' knowledge or consent. - In the two-year, five-month period between December, 2006 and April, 2009, the clinic charged $560,850 to CareCredit credit cards issued to its patients. About half that amount was later refunded by the clinic to patients who complained. The Attorney General's office also published a Consumer Alert cautioning patients to be wary of high-pressure sales pitches using health care credit cards [11]. After the lawsuit was settled, the Minnesota licensing board suspended Couillard's license [12]. In 2011, the Minnesota Board suspended the license of Jeffrey Styba, D.C. for improperly enrolling patients into credit card plans, overbilling them, ordering unnecessary services, and failing to keep adequate records. The board noted that when enrolling patients in a CareCredit plan, Styba or a staff member would complete the application form online and routinely claim an annual income at or above $120,000. Rather than inquiring about the patient's income, he or his staff would just \"plug in a number.\" Styba was ordered to pay a $30,000 administrative fine and pass an examination in ethics and boundaries. When he did neither, the board extended his suspension and in 2014 canceled his license [13]. The South Dakota Board of Chiropractic Examiners has banned the use of prepayment contracts and taken disciplinary action against at least three chiropractors who used them: - In 2011, the board disciplined Josh Biberdorf, D.C. for entering into contracts in which patients received a discount for paying for services in advance. In South Dakota, entering into a contract that obligated patients to pay for future care is considered unprofessional conduct. The case was settled with a consent agreement under which Biberdorf was assessed $10,000 and placed on probation for one year during which the board was entitled to review his records to verify that he had discontinued the use of prepayment contracts. He was also required to complete the [ProBE Ethics and Boundaries Program](http://www.cpepdoc.org/programs-courses/probe). [14]. During the proceedings, Biberdorf told the board that about 20% of his patients entered prepayment. In a subsequent newspaper interview, he said that although he did not contest the proceedings, he contended that prepayment contracts are ethical and were common among the state's 385 chiropractors. In the same article, the state board's attorney said that \"prepaid plans may create, in the mind of the patient, a perceived need for care which may exceed appropriate care under the circumstances\" and \"may also create improper financial incentives for chiropractors to provide unnecessary treatment.\" [15] At the time he was disciplined, Biberdorf was president of the South Dakota Chiropractors Association. - In 2013, the board reprimanded Jayson D. Snyder, D.C. and placed him on probation for one year. He was also assessed $1,750 in costs, ordered to cancel all contracts that had been signed that year, and ordered to participate in the ProBE program [16]. - In 2013, the board began a disciplinary action against Bryan Williams, D.C. for unprofessional conduct that included using prepayment contracts in violation of the board's rules. Although William denied the allegations, he told the board he was planning to relocate to another state and signed a consent agreement under which he agreed to pay administrative costs of $4,400. He also voluntarily surrendered his license but is permitted to reapply if he wants to practice again in South Dakota [17]. The Georgia Board of Chiropractic Examiners has ruled that, as of January 9, 2012, it would be considered unprofessional conduct for any chiropractor to use \"coercion, duress, fraud, overreaching diagnosis, harassment, intimidation or undue influence\" to enter into a financial contract that obligates a patient for care or payment for care. In addition: - The patient must be given a permanent copy of the signed contact; and the contract must provide a clearly defined refund policy typed in not less than 12 point font. An initial line must be next to the refund policy and must be initialed by the patient. - The contract must contain the statement \"There is insufficient evidence to suggest that not receiving chiropractic care will lead to death, paralysis, disability or permanent harm.\" Said statement must be typed in not less than 12 point font. - Any chiropractor who enters into a prepayment financial contract with a patient must allow the patient 48 hours to sign and return the contract. During this 48-hour evaluation period from the time when a copy of the written contract is provided to the patient; no content of the contract can be changed. - Any chiropractor who enters into a prepaid financial contract with a patient shall determine and record the patient's clinical objective which the per-paid care is designed to achieve and provide the patient with a copy of this objective [18]. In 2013, the Texas Board of Chiropractic Examiners fined Randall Johns, D.C. $1,000 and ordered $590 restitution to a former patient who had paid $2,675 in advance but stopped before having all of the treatments, and was not reimbursed for the treatments not received [19]. In 2013, the Idaho Board of Chiropractic Physicians and Spencer G. Williams, D.C., signed a stipulation and consent order what stated: The Board received information that [Williams] may have engaged in unfair and abusive billing practices by using high pressure tactics to have patients sign extended Patient Case Fee Agreements requiring as many as 135 office visits. Said contracts further require patients to pay penalties if they do not attend special additional training. The extent of the contracts is not fully explained to the patient and an undisclosed monthly billing fee is also assessed. In some cases, patients have been required to make patient referrals to cover all or part of their fees. Respondent has also engaged in code splitting and significant overutilization of services. Although Williams denied the allegations, he agreed to (a) stop the challenged practices, (b) take a continuing education course in ethics, and (c) pay $6,000 for investigative costs and attorneys fees [20]. A Florida law enacted in 2012 limits the amount that a chiropractor can hold in trust to $1,500. That should prevent Florida chiropractors from collecting full contract amounts in advance from patients who pay directly. However, contracts with installment plans can still be used [21]. That same year, David Yachter and the Florida Board of Chiropractic Medicine signed a settlement agreement under which he was reprimanded, ordered to pay a $6,000 fine plus $5233.31 for costs, placed on probation for 2 years, and required to take continuing education courses in risk management, record-keeping, and coding [22]. The agreement settled charges that (a) he had improperly recommended that an 87-year-old patient undergo treatment that included 80 spinal adjustments, (b) the patient paid $3,034.50 in advance to get a discounted price and (c) Yachter had failed to follow proper trust accounting procedures for the payment [23]. Michael McClain, D.C., who operates Vital Energy Chiropractic in Helena, Montana has been disciplined by the Montana Board of Chiropractors for marketing treatment plans with 72 or 80 prepaid visits. In 2013 and 2014, he settled complaints by revising his procedures to separate recommendations for \"medically necessary/corrective care\" from those for \"wellness/maintenance care.\" He is also required to administer an informed consent form that specifies that his wellness/maintenance plan \"makes no representation that any treatment it offers will cure or prevent any condition, disease, or event, other than vertebral subluxation.\" [24] In 2014, the Montana board also reprimanded his wife, Terah McClain, D.C., for her involvement with one of the patients [25]. Washington State regulations state that it is unprofessional conduct for \"any chiropractor to enter into a contract which would obligate a patient to pay for care to be rendered in the future, unless the contract provides that the patient is entitled to a complete refund for any care not received.\" [26] [Colorado rules ](https://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/GenerateRulePdf.do?ruleVersionId=5187)permit the patient to cancel. prepaid contracts within 30 days of signing. [Kentucky rules](https://kbce.ky.gov/Documents/BCE%20Law%20and%20Regulations%20Booklet.pdf) consider it unprofessional to directly or indirectly engage in \"threatening, dishonest, or misleading fee collection techniques, including having patients enter into a contract for a course of treatment.\" North Carolina regulations state that a patient who terminates a treatment plan early has a right to a pro-rata refund for unused services [27]. Government Actions Involving CareCredit In 2013, the Financial Protection Bureau ordered GE Capital Retail Bank and its subsidiary, CareCredit to refund up to $34.1 million to potentially more than 1 million consumers who had been victims of deceptive credit card enrollment tactics [28]. The agency's press release noted that at professional offices around the country, consumers were signed up for CareCredit credit cards they thought were interest free, but were actually accruing interest that would kick in if the full balance were not paid at the end of a \"promotional\" period. The settlement also called for better disclosures [29]. Earlier that year, GE Capital Retail Bank and CareCredit settled a lawsuit by the New York Attorney General by agreeing to similar safeguards (plus a few others) and payment of $125,000 to cover the costs incurred during the investigation and monitoring of the matter [30. The documents in these cases did not mention whether chiropractic offices were involved, but I assume they were. In 2017, the CareCredit Web site announced: CareCredit has recently implemented a CareCredit Certification for enrolled Providers in an effort to ensure that every CareCredit card applicant is given a clear, easy-to-understand explanation of financing options available. This Certification acknowledges the Provider's dedication and knowledge in providing consistent and accurate information to their patients/clients, so the patient/client can make well-informed decisions about their care. This Certification is renewed every two years to help ensure that patients/clients are given the most current information [31]. The announcement does not indicate whether the certification process looks at whether patients are offered unnecessary treatments or abusive contracts. My Advice to Consumers The best way to avoid being tricked is to stay away from tricksters. In line with this, I have published a list of warning signs that are associated with overselling [32]. The most important are \"free examinations\" and recommendations to treat \"subluxations.\" If you have signed a chiropractic contract of the type described above and later conclude that keep the following mind: - Contracts covering multiple visits over a period of months are probably not enforceable. Penalty causes are probably unenforceable, and most chiropractic licensing boards would view them as unethical. However, if a health care credit card is use to make payment, the patient is obligated to repay the loan company. - If you have had as much help as you need, don't let a contract intimidate you. Ask for cancellation of the contract and a full refund of unused services with no penalty. - If you conclude that the whole treatment plan was unnecessary, demand a refund of all payment. - If the chiropractor claims that you owe money and has an authorization to submit additional charges to a credit company, ask the company not to pay any more and cancel your account if necessary to protect yourself. - Don't worry excessively about a threat to turn you over to a collection agency. Failure to pay chiropractic bills will rarely affect your credit rating. If an agency becomes involved, simply tell them to stop contacting you. - Be prepared to complain to the state chiropractic board and the Better Business Bureau. Before doing so, give the chiropractor a final chance to resolve the situation amicably. - If you plan to complain, get a copy of your records so they cannot be altered later. - A suit in small claims court might be successful. In some states, a suit under the state's Unfair Trade Practices Act could lead to a significant penalty and reimbursement of attorney fees [33,34]. - If you need additional advice, [please send me an e-mail](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e89b8a81868e87a8999d898b839f899c8b80c6879a8f)that describes why you sought care, what you were told, what you were sold, and what else happened. Please also send a copy of the contract and any other records your have and include your phone number.

Volume 15, Issue #3 TIME'S OVERLY OPTIMISTIC VITAMIN COVER STORY The April 6 issue of Time read like a health food magazine as it shouted the headlines: \"New research shows they [vitamins] may help fight cancer, heart disease and the ravages of aging. The article's byline stated: \" ... no, you may not be getting enough of these crucial nutrients in your diet.\" Editor's note: \"May'\"is a weasel word\" that automatically states \"may not.\" The term Weasel word is derived from from the weasel's habit of sucking the contents out of an egg while leaving the shell superficially intact]. It is defined as a word used in order to evade or retreat from a direct or forthright statement or position\" (Webster'.s). \"Weasel words have become more than just an evasion or retreat .... they can make you hear things that are not being said, accept as truths things that have only been implied, and believe things that have only been suggested. When you hear a weasel word, you automatically hear the implication. Not the real meaning, but the meaning ii wants you to hear\" (Wrighter. / Can Sell You Anything. NY: Ballantine, 1972). The article read like the propaganda we regularly receive from the Vitamin Nutrition Information Service (VNIS), a Hoffman-LaRoche (Roche) public relations program that promotes supplementation by distribution selectively favorable literature. Toe article's false premise is that scientific positions which question the benefits of self-prescribed supplementation with glamor nutrients (ie, those popularized by enthusiasts) are now outmoded. Scientists were selectively quoted as supporting \"a new paradigm\" which endorses supplementation. Many who spoke favorably of supplements are, or have been, supported by the supplement industry. Dr. Victor Herbert had supplied the Time author with solid evidence of the potential harm of self-supplementation, but the substance of his comments were deleted. Instead, he was simply quoted as a nay-sayer for the status quo that we get all that we need from food and vitamins only make expensive urine. Feigning balance, the message clearly was to take vitamins. Toe article went beyond advocacy to prescription by presenting a table of vitamins and their possible benefits. The article comes at a critical time when Congress is being bombarded with mail stimulated by the health food-supplement industry trying to squelch proposed FDA policies aimed at reigning-in the out-of-control marketing of supplements. Is this just a coincidence or does somebody besides us smell something funny here? The Rest of the Story After the foregoing item was composed, we found that Probe (5/l/92) had done a critique of the Time article titled \"Vitamin Bs Boost Sales.\" In its analysis, Probe called weasel words \"fudge words.\" About may it said \"in one Times table this fudge word appears an incredible 15 times. But the powerful thrust of the piece, and the media message is that the 'mays' are but quibbles.\" Probe revealed that the source of Time's story was a press kit about a New York Academy of Sciences (NYAS) conference held in Arlington, VA, Feb. 9-12, which was proposed and mainly funded by Roche, the world's largest vitamin manufacturer. The conference did not include a cross-section of scientists, but hand-picked people whose work favored supplementation. One of the co-chairmen, who chose the speakers, was vitamin researcher Lawrence Machlin who works for Roche. Probe also noted that the NYAS had designated the conference as an official continuing education course (CME) for physicians. New rules proposed by the FDA say that CME events should \"meet standards for independence\" and that a drug company \"should take specific steps to ensure objectivity, balance and scientific rigor,\" and \"not be able to exert control, express or implied, over the scientific contents of the activity.\" Such standards clearly were not met in this case. The greatest impropriety was how the conference was promoted to the media. The public relations firm Ketchum put its press release on an NYAS letterhead and did not reveal that the conference was sponsored by Roche. The press kit included unproved medical claims (eg, \"prevents cancer\") that are unlawful for dietary supplements either on labels or in promotional materials, such as a manufacturer's press release. By hiding the fact that the conference was proposed, largely paid for, and heavily influenced by Roche, a press package laced with illegal claims became the basis for the biggest vitamin promotion of the decade. The contact person for the Ketchum press release was Maureen Temus, MS, RD. Curiously, the VNIS contact person for another pro-vitamin package, \"Antioxidant Vitamins: Good News for Healthy Hearts,\" distributed by Roche in April, 1992 was the same Maureen Temus. What TIME Left Out Dr. Herbert had urged Time to include the cautions that no study of feeding supplements to any group of generally healthy Americans bas shown supplements produce less disease or longer life spans. In fact, the only study of vitamin E megadoses in elderly people found that the vitamin takers died twice as fast as those who did not take mega-E. Just as there is evidence that vitamin supplements may protect against some kinds of cancer and heart disease, there is also evidence that such supplements may promote other kinds of cancer and heart disease. For instance, in the 10% of Americans who inherit a gene for iron overload disease (heterozygous hemochromatosis) vitamin C supplements are more likely to cause rather than prevent cancer by mobilizing highly oxidant catalytic iron from body stores. Excess iron stored in heart muscle can cause fatal arrhythmias. Iron supplements are twice as likely to harm as to help men and postmenopausal women. The body converts vitamin C to oxalic acid, and those Americans who pile up oxalate can get oxalate kidney stones. (Time poo-pooed the vitamin C-kidney stone connection). Herbert also warned that vitamin C megadoses can throw AIDS patients into fatal hypovolemic shock. Women contemplating pregnancy or pregnant should not take daily more than 10,000 IU of vitamin A because as little as 25,000 IU daily (5X the RDA) can cause birth defects. Time ignored these dangers in favor of a few benign warnings. EMS CASE UNRELATED TO L-TRYPTOPHAN REPORTED A case of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with dietary supplement use which did not include L-tryptophan is reported by Michael Patmas, MD (New Jersey Medicine, 1992;89:285-6). Toe patient used \"an array of supplements and homeopathic remedies including lysine.\" Further research is called for. Who Will Win: The Special Interests or Consumers? Congress had the wisdom to pass the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA); we soon shall see if it has the courage to see it through. The health food, supplement and herbal industries coalition is pulling out all of the stops to defeat proposed reforms. These industries have many allies in the media who are themselves vitaminophiliacs (lovers of vitamins \u2014 or more perhaps with the idea of vitamins) who eagerly publish and broadcast pro-vitamin messages. A million letters are being sent to Congress by the health food devotees. How Congress interprets all of this attention may hold the key. Knowing that the country is mad as hell at them for repeatedly selling out to special interest groups, if it becomes clear that the lobbying and letter-writing scampaign is the work of the very special interest group that the NLEA was designed to curtail, Americans might get better consumer protection. If, however, these efforts are seen as representing voters whose support is needed to win elections this fall, the results could be a victory for the health scam artists. NLEA is the most significant consumer protection reform in the past 30 years. Concerned citizens are urged to make their voices heard on this critical matter. DECEPT1VE TACllCS USED TO PROMOTE SPORTS AIDS An article by exercise physiologist David Lightsey, MS and Jerry Attaway, M.Ed, Physical Development Coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers, details deceptive tactics used to promote alleged ergogenic (ie, athletic performance enhancing) aids. Lightsey is Coordinator of NCAHFs Ergogenic Aids Task Force. A number of deceptive marketing strategies became clear during the group's investigations of the claims of 45 companies which advertise in popular athletic and bodybuilding magazines. Their report descrlbes deceptive tacticss such as taking research results out of context; pro team endorsements (some unauthorized); falsely claiming that double-blind research is underway; stating that research is not for public review; using testimonials; implying that a product patent is proof of value; using inappropriate bibliographic citations; using media publicity examples as proof; doing mail order fitness evaluations; and using inappropriate anabolic measurements. (National Strength & Conditioning Assoc 1, 1992;14:26-31) DR. SISTER'S DIET SCAM A Canadian journalist has uncovered facts discrediting Dr. Sister's Method and Dr. Sister's Supplement plan. The plan includes a book and a one-month supply of supplements for $49.95. Investigation revealed that a picture of \"brilliant physician\" Dr. Daniel Sister, turned out to have the same face as Dr. Daniel Johnson, brilliant discoverer of Dr. Johnson's Method. Both are products of the Montreal-based MSA Company. The FDA issued an import alert on the product on March 5. The product contains guar gum, which can swell up causing esophageal or intestinal blockages. No evidence could be obtained to prove that either Dr. Sister or Johnson were real people.

Available from Consumer's Union. TIME ARTICLE USED IN HEAL1H FOOD INDUS'IRY CAMPAIGN The National Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA) called the 4/6/92 Time cover story \"the most positive and powerful public relations tool that the industry bas been able to use in years.\" As a result, the NNF A is sending a copy to every member of Congress. Meetings are being arranged between NNF A reps, members of Congress, and key government officials (named are HHS Secretary Sullivan, US Surgeon General Novello and VP Dail Quayle). Tours of NNFA-member manufacturing plants are also being offered and Strom Thurmond has already attended one in So. Carolina. (NNFA Update 4/}.2/92) DANGEROUS DENTAL PRODUCT Formaldehyde-containing paste known as \"Sargenti paste,\" \"RC-2B,\"or \"N-2,\" has been used as a low-cost, quick one-stop root canal technique for many years. Toe paste \"mummifies\" the tooth by replacing the pulp with a toxic substance. The paste doesn't cause problems if it stays contained within the tooth, but therein lies the problem. The paste can be difficult to control during application. It can ooze out of the opening at the bottom of the tooth and reek havoc with other tissues. The entire paste is not FDA-approved, which means that the only way it can be supplied legally is by having\u00b7 it prepared within a state's boundaries. There is a history of successful lawsuits against DDS's who have used this method (almost exclusively nonspecialists who have learned the technique at a workshop) and their suppliers. A recent case involved a California woman who suffered permanent nerve damage to her jaw with attendant pain, numbness, and dysfunction has been settled for $75,000. A special verdict against the suppliers of the paste, Available Products, Inc. and Elbee Chemists, of $25,000 was also assessed. (lrsheid v Truong, Sao Francisco Superior Court, #908373). TEACHlNG CRITICAL THINKING The editor of The American Biology Teacher says that we should teach critical thinking as a necessity for living, not just as a tool for science in an editorial in the January, 1992 issue. Randy Moore focuses on alleged paranormal matters, many of which have health implications (eg, astrology, New Age, crystal power, pyramid power, numerology, Scientology, psychic surgery, faith healers and reincarnation. He points out how the failure to discriminate between sound and unsound beliefs in these areas can affect health decisions. This 6-page article is worth reading and sending to educators. DIET AND CANCER PREVENTION Victor Herbert, MD, JD Epidemiology teaches that a diet high in fruits and vegetables, and low in calories-especially fat calories-is preferable to tower the risk of cancer. But, overly enthusiastic advocates of supplementation to prevent cancer. regularly confuse coincidence with cause-and-effect in epidemiological studies. They represent vitamins, antioxidants and carotenoids as the primary benefcial constituents of diet, and use blood levels of these chemicals as their gauges. In reality, many vitamins, antioxidants. and carotenoids are redox agents that can be harmful in excess. One should measure oxidized ascorbate and serum ferritin to get a better picture of the biochemical reality of what's happening in the body than will be revealed by simply measuring the reduced ascorbate in the blood. Excess antioxidants may harm by destroying oxidant activity of nitric oxide (NO), an important natural regulator produced by cells. Vitamin C is so potent a redox agent in the presence of iron that vitamin E researchers use a vitamin C-iron mixture to inactivate vitamin E. Only 6% of Americans (mainly menstruating females) are in negative iron balance, but 10% of Caucasian men and women and 8% of American blacks have a gene for iron overload (heterozygous hemochromatosis). Vitamin C exacerbates this problem because it enhances iron absorption. Vitamin C also releases iron from body stores as catalytic iron, and catalytic iron is one of the most viciously oxidant substances known to man. According to Margit Krikker, President of the Hemochromatosis Research Foundation, daily megadoses of vitamin C for years, enhancing their iron absorption, were responsible for cardiac deaths in at least three athletes, who were unaware of their genetic predisposition to iron-loading. Further, vitamin C catabolizes to oxalate, and those Americans who pile up oxalate can get harmful deposits in the kidneys and other organs. The pill sellers don't reveal that the more vitamin C one takes, the lower the percent of it is absorbed. The rest passes out in the stool, often producing hyperosmotic diarrhea on its way. Some of the excess vitamin C is converted in the gut to oxalate which is absorbed increasing the body's oxalate burden. The emphasis upon beta carotene and its marketing as a supplement is misguided. Beta carotene is a much less potent singlet oxygen trapper than the carotenoid lycopene. Lycopene, which is high in tomatoes, is vastly preferable as an antioxidant to the beta carotene which is high in carrots. We agree that efforts should be made to convince the average American to eat more fruits and vegetables and less fat. We do not agree that the nutritional approach to cancer prevention should emphasize vitamins, antioxidants and carotenoids. Such is sophism, not science. Such thinking promotes\u00b7 inappropriate supplement usage, and encourages excess dosages (ie, if a little is good, a lot is better). Nutrition-against-cancer enthusiasts ignore toxicity and display their ignorance by equating high-doses with \"optimal.\" All over-the-counter supplement labels should state: \"NOTICE: It has not been determined whether non-prescription use of this product is helpful, harmful, or neutral in terms of health or longevity.\" ARIZONA DO'S BACK DOWN ON CHELATION THERAPY BAN We reported in the Jan-Feb issue that the Arizona Board of Osteopathic Examiners had banned chelation therapy. We now learn that the board rescinded their ban on advice from the Attorney General's office due to the possibility of anti-trust action.- This is- an indication of the sad state of affairs in consumer protection via medical discipline. The legal eagles seem to have forgotten about the principle of \"unfair competition\" that can be aimed at promoters of unproven remedies. Doctors who restrict themselves to telling the truth are put at an unfair advantage by quacks. JUICEMAN One of the most aggressive promoters of dietary magic around today is Jay Kordicb, the \"Juiceman.\" We first learned of Kordich's claims in a Las Vegas ReviewJournal (c.1991) story. Kordich, a mostly raw-foods vegetarian, claims to have cured himself of bladder cancer some 40 years ago by gulping vegetable juices that be whizzed up himself. Now he's got a line of juice-makers be calls Juiceman that be is huckstering all over the country. A telephoned report from Baltimore is that Kordicb did an infomercial in which members of the audience claiming to suffer from various disorders would come down, get a sample of freshly whizzed up juice to drink, and declare that they would use the device in the future. This medicine show approach is likely to attract the attention of the FfC which is keeping an eye on advertising abuses via infomercials. Another promotional stunt that the FfC is likely to look askance at is the promotional newsletter Choices produced by The Juiceman company which is loaded with direct health claims, testimonials, and ads for Juiceman products. Glen Braswell was sent to jail for a similar scheme in which he created what appeared to be a magazine but was actually a promotional publication for his products. From what we have seen, we believe that it is just a matter of time before Kordich will face a day of legal reckoning. Kordich's book The Juiceman's Power of Juicing was #4 on the NY Times Best-Seller list the last week of April. [Footnote: Disadvantages of juicing are that, because of the huge amounts of fruits & vegetables required and the high price of the juicers (c. $300), it is very expensive and most of the dietary fiber is discarded.] BLUE-GREEN ALGAE IS BAACK In 1986, the FDA prosecuted K.C. Laboratories of Klamath Falls, Oregon, for its promotion -of blue-green algae. Typical of today's nutrition hucksters the company claimed that its product was a food and needed no FDA approval. FDA contended that the product's drug claims (the company claimed algae could treat a wide variety of ailments) required that they be proved safe and effective before marketing. The saga was reported in the July-August, 1986 FDA Consumer. A court injunction issued in December, 1985, against the production and sale of blue-green algae products was made permanent in February, 1986. In 1992, NCAHF is again receiving inquiries about extravagant health claims being made for Super Blue Green, an algae product from Klamath Falls, Oregon. Claims are presented in a kind of \"now you see it, now you don't\" fashion which first extols the disease-related benefits of nutrients such as beta carotene and pseudonutrients such as chlorophyll, and then points out what a great source of the nutrient blue-green algae just happens to be. The message being sent is clear; super blue-green is health food. Sometimes drug claims are disguised as \"commonly reported benefits.\" \"Increased energy and vitality,\" \"alleviation of stress, anxiety and depression,\" relief from fatigue, hypoglycemia, many allergies, poor digestion, sluggishness and more,\" and \"improved memory and mental clarity,\" are but a few. The product is being multilevel marketed which usually means that individual salespeople will add their own anecdotal reports of miracles to their pitches. It seems clear that fines alone are not enough to stop the promoters of lucrative health schemes. Health fraud has become expensive enough that the FBI bas doubled the number of agents who will work on the problem. Toe fiscal 1993 budget asks for 24 additional assistant U.S. attorneys (to a total of 50) to work on health care fraud. Presumably, efforts will focus on those defrauding Medicare. Such activities do not necessarily involve quackery (ie, promoting false or unproven methods) but often involve false billing and other practices (see NCAHF NL, Nov-Dec, 1990 for a description of how health fraud generally is done). However, some forms of quackery (eg, AIDS, cancer) have become so large and lucrative that they are apt to be targeted. Recall that it was the FBI which nailed Jimmy Keller, and the conviction was for wire fraud. According to the cover story of the 2/24f)2 U.S. News & World Report (yes, Virginia, the same publication that overrated fringe medicine in its 9/23/91 cover story) health care fraud may amount to $80 billion per year. Toe article is worth reading and the problem even more worthy of note. Toe patrons of unregulated free enterprise should again take notice. They can add health care fraud to the HUD and.S&L scandals, and the rip-offs associated with health claims for foods to the results of poor regulation. SIGNS OF CHIROPRACTIC PROGRESS MISLEADING Recent stories being planted in the media about chiropractic's progress appear to be misleading: University-based education. The University of Bridgeport (UB) recently started a chiropractic program. This looked good until the recent report that UB is bankrupt and about to close until the Rev. Sun Yung Moon, leader of the Moonie cult, agreed to buy it (Newsweek, 4/1.1 f)2). Toe chiropractic program appears to have been started out of financial desperation. Hospital privileges. PR people brag that hospitals now admit DCs to their staffs. Toe number of hospitals is about 30, most of which are in financial difficulty and are trying to expand their marketing base. Value of manipulation. DC propagandists are ballyhooing the RAND study as supportive of chiropractic. They do not reveal that (1) the chiropractic profession paid for the study; (2) 4 of the 9 evaluators of the studies were favorably-biased DCs; (3) only 4 of the 22 controlled trials involved chiropractic manipulation (ie, versus safer techniques used by physical therapists, DOs, etc.); (4) nor do they come clean by accurately presenting RAND's conclusion that \"the efficacy of spinal manipulation is neither proven nor disproven at this time.\" In a KNBC-1V Los Angeles interview, RAND project director Paul Sbekelle, MD, said only that manipulative therapy was \"better than doing nothing\" for back pain. Referrals by MDs. In the wake of the AMA antitrust case, MDs are now aware that they may refer to DCs if they wish, but there is no good evidence that they are doing so. MDs appear to be as unwilling as ever to trust their patients to nonscientific DCs. Workmen's Compensation Successes. The studies being pushed to show that DCs are superior to MDs in workmen's comp cases are inadequate as proof. None control for the severity of the injuries (the more serious ones are more likely to be treated by MDs); none control for the difference between mere customer satisfaction and true effectiveness; and, the DCs only mention the ones that make them look good. Other workmen's comp studies have showed DCs to be overpriced and of marginal value.

Stoller, who trained primarily as a pediatrician, is best known for his advocacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. In 2019, the San Francisco City Attorney served a subpoena that sought Stoller's medical records for all vaccine exemptions he had written since 2016 (the year that California enacted SB 277 to eliminate non-medical vaccine exemptions for school entry). Stoller filed a lawsuit to quash the subpoena, but the suit was unsuccessful.

(2) When the. standard of care requires a change in the diagnosis, act, or omission that constitutes the negligent act described in paragraph (1), including, but not limited to, a reevaluation of the diagnosis or a change in treatment, and the licensee's conduct departs from the applicable standard of care, each departure constitutes a separate and distinct breach of the standard of care. (d) Incompetence. 6. Section 2266 of the Code states: The failure of a physician and surgeon to maintain adequate and accurate records relating to the provision of services to their patients constitutes unprofessional conduct. OTHER STATUTES 7. Health and Safety Code section 120325 provides: In enacting this chapter, but excluding Section 120380, and in enacting Sections 120400, 120405, 120410, and 120415, it is the intent of the Legislature to provide: (a) A means for the eventual achievement of total immunization of appropriate age groups against the following childhood diseases: - - Diphtheria. - Hepatitis B. - Haemophilus influenza type b. - Measles. - Mumps. - Pertussis (whooping cough). - Poliomyelitis, - Rubella. - Tetanus. - Varicella (chickenpox). - Any other disease deemed appropriate by the department, taking into consideration the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the. United States Department of Health and Human Services, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians. (b) That the persons required to be immunized be allowed to obtain immunizations from whatever medical source they so desire, subject only to the condition that the immunization be performed in accordance with the regulations of the department and that a record of the immunization is made in accordance with the regulations. (c) Exemptions from immunization for medical reasons. (d) For the keeping of adequate records of immunization so that health: departments, schools, and other institutions, parents or guardians, and-the persons immunized will be able to ascertain that a child is fully or only partially immunized, and so that appropriate public agencies will be able to ascertain the immunization needs of groups of children in schools or other institutions. (e) Incentives to public health authorities to design innovative-and creative programs that will promote and achieve Juli and timely immunization of children. 8. At all relevant times, former Health and Safety Code section 120370 provided, in pertinent part: (a) If the parent or guardian files with the governing authority a written statement by a, licensed physician to the effect that the physical condition of the child is such, or medical circumstances relating to the child are such, that immunization is not considered safe, indicating the specific nature arid probable duration of the medical condition or circumstances; including,. but not limited to, family medical history, for which the physician does not recommend immunization, that child shall be exempt from the requirements of Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 12Q325, but excluding Section 120380) and Sections i20400, 120405, 120410, and 120415 to the extent indicated by the physician's statement. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 9. At all relevant times, Respondent Kenneth P. Stoller, M.D., was a physician and surgeon with a specialization in pediatrics at his office in San Francisco, California. 10. In 2015, the California Legislature amended Health and Safety Code section 120325 to eliminate personal beliefs as a basis for exemption from required immunizations for school-aged children. As a consequence, school-aged children not subject to any other exception were required to have immunizations for 10 vaccine-preventable childhood illnesses as a condition of public school attendance. 11. Beginning in 2016, Respondent began issuing medical exemptions to school-aged children. 12. Patient 1, a 4-month old male, was seen by Respondent on or about August 9, 2016. Patient 1 had a medical history significant for a congenital heart defect, and reports of vomiting, shortness of breath and difficulty gaining weight. Respondent's records state a history of present illness (HPI) as the parents' concern about an adverse event from immunization (AEFI). Respondent did not document an examination or record vital signs. His plan was to test for HLA DRBl/DQBl genes. Based on subsequent testing, Respondent concluded that the HLA-DRBl *13 allele was absent and that the child had an HLA DRBI 03 allele, which genetic polymorphisms Respondent concluded would likely make him a vaccine non-responder to the vaccines for measles and hepatitis B. Albeit he had not identified any vaccine contraindication or precaution, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and/or the American Academy of Pediatrics, Respondent issued a medical exemption for Patient 1 that was global, i.e. applying to all vaccines, and permanent in duration. 13. Patient 2, a 2.5-year-old female, was seen by Respondent on September 27, 2018. The examination documented for Patient 2 was within normal limits and her medical history was unremarkable for any contraindications or precautions for any vaccines. Nevertheless, Respondent issued a temporary medical exemption based upon the history of a sibling who reportedly had an AEFI after his 6-month immunizations and had thereafter developed a learning disability. Although the temporary exemption stated that the child would be undergoing an \"Adverse Event Risk Assessment,\" no further testing or evaluation was performed and/or documented. 14. Patient 3, the 4.5-year-old male sibling of Patient 2, was also seen by Respondent on September 27, 2018. The parents reported that they believed Patient 3 had developed dyspraxia/apraxia after receiving a set of six immunizations at age 6 months. They reported that the morning after he received the vaccines, Patient 3 was found lying in \"a puddle of blood and vomitus.\" Respondent described the reported event variously as \"near exsanguitory\" and an \"acute Respondent did not obtain the child's pediatric records, nor did he investigate further. Respondent's plan was to perform genetic testing, however, such testing is not documented and apparently was not done. Respondent issued a temporary exemption from all required vaccinations. 15. Patient 4, a 4-year old female, was seen by Respondent on December 14, 2015. At that time, the child's mother reported that the child had not had any immunizations and that the mother was concerned that the child might have a genetic predisposition to adverse reactions to vaccinations, based upon a family history of autoimmune illnesses and relatives with neurodevelopmental issues and autism. Respondent did not obtain or review any past medical records. On or about April 29, 2016, Respondent issued a medical exemption letter for Patient 4. In that document, Respondent stated that Patient 4 \"has genetic issues\" and as a result, \"she is at high risk of adverse events to vaccination so that vaccinations are not considered safe.\" As with Patient 1, discussed above, the exemption is permanent and barred administration of any and all vaccines. In his \"Adverse Event Risk Assessment Report,\" Respondent stated that the basis for his conclusion that vaccines were unsafe for the child was that \"the patient has the IRFl/MTHFR/IL-4 polymorphism.\" In a subsequent interview, Respondent acknowledged that genetic polymorphisms are not recognized by the CDC as medical contraindications to vaccination. 16. Patient 5, a 6-year old female, was seen by Respondent on December 18, 2017. Prior to that visit, as was his custom and practice, Respondent conducted a telephone interview with the child's father. In that interview, the HPI was stated as the parent's concern that the child would be at risk of an adverse vaccine reaction based upon a sibling with \"post vaccine auto-immune issues including but not limited to chronic joint pain and allergies to various foods, gluten and metals.\" Respondent's plan was to perform genetic testing, for which the parents were instructed to purchase \"23 and Me\" a direct-to-consumer ancestry and genetic testing product. Respondent then interpreted the raw data to conclude that the child had multiple polymorphisms on multiple genes which he stated were related to adverse risks from vaccinations. Respondent issued a permanent exemption from all vaccinations for the child, which stated that \"vaccination is not considered safe due to [Patient 5's] specific genetics.\" 17. Patient 6, a 12-year old male child and sibling of Patient 5, underwent the same evaluation as his sister and received a permanent and global exemption from all vaccinations based upon genetic polymorphisms. 18. Patient 7, a 5-year old female, was seen by Respondent on January 3, 2018. Prior to that visit, in a telephone consultation, the child's parents had attributed the child's dyspraxia and speech delay to previous vaccinations and requested a genomic assessment. Respondent concluded that the child had polymorphisms on 8 of 12 genes associated with adverse event following immunization (AEFI), specifically IRFl and SCNlA and \"a cousin with documented AEFI (VAERS).\" No medical documentation relating to the cousin is contained in Respondent's chart. The exemption is permanent and applies to all required vaccines. 19. Patient 8, a 12-year old female, was seen by Respondent on December 7, 2017. That was preceded by an August telephone consultation with the child's parents. which Respondent summarized as a discussion of her prolonged encephalitic reaction and \"stroke\" related to a Hepatitis B vaccine. Patient 8 was given a permanent exemption from all vaccinations based upon her \"unusual history\" and on polymorphisms on HLA DRBl AND SCNlA genes. 20. Patient 9, a 12-year old female, was evaluated by Respondent on January 3, 2018. The visit was preceded by a September 13, 2017 telephone call from the child's mother in which the mother stated that the child needed an exemption within ten days or \"she can't go to school.\" In a telephone consultation that took place on the following day, Respondent made note that the child has \"immediate family 'members with multiple autoimmune diseases and who seems to have gone thru a multiple year period of having very compromised health post vaccination including but not limited to multiple URI/LRI, asthma, atopia and otitis infections.\" A temporary exemption was issued as to all vaccines and, after testing, a permanent and global exemption was issued based on double mutation on the HLA DQBl and double mutation on the IRFl gene, which Respondent stated \"play such a strong roll [sic] in having untoward immune reactions to foreign substances and biotoxins.\" 21. Patient 10, a 5-year old female, was seen on March 8, 2018. During an earlier telephone consultation, Patient l0's mother had requested that the child be screened for genetic risk from vaccines and she related a family history of \"auto-immune issues\" and an older sibling who developed \"overt neuro-behavioral delays\" after receiving vaccines. The mother complained that the school nurse \"sees it as her job to protect the community from unvaccinated children.\" The same at-home genetic test resulted in findings of multiple polymorphisms and Respondent opined that the child was at increased risk of an AEFI and 'should be permanently exempted from all required vaccinations. FIRST CAUSE FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION (Gross Negligence/Repeated Negligent Acts/Incompetence) 22. Respondent Kenneth Paul Stoller, M.D. is subject to disciplinary action pursuant to section 2234 and/or 2234(b) and/or 2234(c) and/or 2234(d) in that Respondent engaged in unprofessional conduct and was grossly negligent and/or repeatedly negligent and/or incompetent in his care and treatment of the patients described in paragraphs 12 and 15 through 21 above, which are incorporated herein. 23. Respondent routinely performed genetic testing for the purpose of determining whether a child should be exempted from required vaccinations. Genetic testing in order to determine vaccine response or risk for adverse events following immunization is not recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). The standard of care for a primary care provider and specialist is to follow national standards for pediatric vaccination practices and immunization recommendations from the CDC, issued through the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, as summarized in The Red Book. Genetic variations in the population are normal and to be expected. While some differences exist, at the present time, no allele serves as a marker that accurately predicts vaccine response. A permanent exemption for all vaccines based on the polymorphisms described by Respondent is not supported by medical and scientific evidence and constitutes grounds for disciplinary action pursuant to the statutes set forth in paragraph 22. SECOND CAUSE FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION (Gross Negligence/Repeated Negligent Acts/Incompetence) 24. Respondent Kenneth Paul Stoller, M.D. is subject to disciplinary action pursuant to section 2234 and/or 2234(b) and/or 2234(c) and/or 2234(d) in that Respondent engaged in unprofessional conduct and was grossly negligent and/or repeatedly negligent and/or incompetent in his care and treatment of the patients described in paragraphs 12 through 21 above, which are incorporated herein. 25. Respondent routinely obtained and relied upon unverified patient and family histories, including but not limited to autoimmune disorders, asthma, gluten sensitivity, inflammatory bowel disease, Hashimoto's disease and other conditions not generally accepted to constitute precautions or contraindications to vaccines. The standard of care for a primary care provider and specialist is to follow national standards for pediatric vaccination practices and immunization recommendations from the CDC, issued through the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and the American. Academy of Pediatrics, as summarized in The Red Book. The conditions described in Respondent's records are not considered precautions or contraindications for routine immunizations by the CDC or AAP. The histories obtained by Respondent are typically scant and insufficiently documented as accepted diagnoses. To document an existing or family history of a condition or reaction without specification of the condition, the person who had the condition and their relation to the patient, and the specific vaccine or vaccine component that the condition or reaction related to, is not standard medical charting. In some cases, Respondent recorded a history of potentially very serious events, such as near SIDS, near exsanguination or acute encephalitis, but he did not obtain the pertinent medical records or otherwise investigate. Respondent's provision of medical exemptions based on conditions not generally accepted as medical precautions or contraindications, his inadequate documentation of patient and family histories and failure to obtain records and/or investigate potentially very serious events fall below the standard of care and constitute grounds for discipline pursuant to the statutes set forth in paragraph 24 above. THIRD CAUSE FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION (Gross Negligence/Repeated Negligent Acts/Incompetence) 26. Respondent Kenneth Paul Stoller, M.D. is subject to disciplinary action pursuant to section 2234 and/or 2234(b) and/or 2234( c) and/or 2234( d) in that Respondent engaged in unprofessional conduct and was grossly negligent and/or repeatedly negligent and/or incompetent in his care and treatment of the patients described in paragraphs 12 through 21 above, which are incorporated herein. 27. Respondent routinely issued exemptions that applied to all vaccines. There is no component that is common to all vaccines. A severe reaction to an earlier dose of a specific vaccine may be a contraindication for another dose of that vaccine or to a dose of a related vaccine that also contains the same constituents, but not to all vaccines. Similarly, a moderate or severe acute illness might be a temporary precaution, resulting in deferral of immunization, but not a permanent, global contraindication to all vaccines. Respondent's issuance of vaccine exemptions which are not specific to a particular vaccine and are permanent and global falls below the standard of care and constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to the statutes set forth in paragraph 26 above. FOURTH CAUSE FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION (Inadequate Records) 28. Respondent Kenneth Paul Stoller, M.D. is subject to disciplinary action pursuant to section 2266 in that Respondent failed to maintain adequate and accurate records. As stated above, Respondent's records contain only scant and vague patient and family histories, lack vaccine-specific evaluations, contain diagnoses not supported by the findings or by medical science and omit reference to prior medical records and/or primary care physicians. PRAYER WHEREFORE, Complainant requests that a hearing be held on the matters herein alleged, and that following the hearing, the Medical Board of California issue a decision: - Revoking or suspending Physician's and Surgeon's Certificate Number A 41183, issued to Respondent; - Revoking, suspending or denying approval of RRespondent's authority to supervise physician assistants and advanced practice nurses; - Ordering Respondent, if placed on probation, to pay the Board. the costs of probation monitoring; and - Taking such other and further action as deemed necessary and proper; DATED: July 29 2019 _________________________ KIMBERLY KIRSHMEYER Executive Director Medical Board of California Department of Consumer Affairs State of California Complainant [Hide Full Content](#seventeen-thousand-nine-hundred-forty) [Government Actions against Richard A.

In 2018, in response to this conviction, the board revoked his license with no right to reapply for it. In 2021, he was convicted of a federal felony related to his attempts to promote a misbranded drug as a preventive for COVID-19. For this he was sentenced in 2022 to eight months in federal prison to be followed by one year of supervised release. This article describes these government actions in detail. Wilson's Syndrome For more than 20 years, \"functional hypothyroidism\" has been promoted as \"Wilson's Syndrome,\" a term concocted by [E. Denis Wilson, M.D](../../../01QuackeryRelatedTopics/fad.html#wilson)., who practiced in Florida in the early 1990s. The syndrome's supposed manifestations include fatigue, headaches, PMS, hair loss, irritability, fluid retention, depression, decreased memory, low sex drive, unhealthy nails, easy weight gain, and about 60 other symptoms. Wilson claims to have discovered a type of abnormally low thyroid function in which routine blood tests of thyroid are often normal. He states that the main diagnostic sign is a body temperature that averages below 98.6\u00b0 F (oral), and that the diagnosis is confirmed if the patient responds to treatment with a \"special thyroid hormone treatment.\" [1] In 1992, the Florida Board of Medicine fined Wilson $10,000, suspended his license for six months, and ordered him to undergo psychological testing [2]. Although he does not appear to have resumed practice, his ideas are still promoted by the [Wilson's Syndrome Foundation](http://donotlink.com/www.wilsonssyndrome.com/). Wilson's syndrome is not recognized by the scientific community as a legitimate diagnostic entity. In 1999, the American Thyroid Association issued a strongly worded statement that concluded: - The proposed basis for \"Wilson's syndrome\" is inconsistent with well-known and widely-accepted facts about thyroid hormone production, metabolism, and action. - The diagnostic criteria for \"Wilson's syndrome\"\u2014nonspecific symptoms and body temperature measurement\u2014are imprecise. - There is no scientific evidence that T3 therapy is better than a placebo would be for management of nonspecific symptoms, such as those that have been described as part of \"Wilson's syndrome,\" in individuals with and normal thyroid hormone concentrations, - T3 therapy results in wide fluctuations in T3 concentrations in blood and body tissues. This produces symptoms and cardiovascular complications in some patients, and is potentially dangerous [3]. Note: Although \"Wilson's Syndrome\"\u2014as defined by Dr. Wilson\u2014is a bogus diagnosis, there is a Wilson's disease, a rare condition caused by a defect in the body's ability to metabolize copper. Disciplinary Action in 1998 In 1994, a local newspaper reported that Marschall had learned about \"Wilson's Syndrome\" by studying Wilson's publications and had consulted Wilson by phone. The article said that Marschall was treating more than 200 Wilson's Syndrome patients and that the cost of the initial diagnosis, including the blood test, was $400 [4]. Court documents filed on September 30, 1997, by Washington's Secretary of Health state: - In 1994, Marschall \"met\" Patient A, a California resident, through an online computer service and discussed Patient A's health concerns via the online service. Soon thereafter, Marschall mailed the patient a personal history form, a fee schedule, a patient/physician contract to read and sign, and instructions on how to take her temperatures. After reading Patient A's completed personal history form and temperature log, he diagnosed the patient as suffering from a thyroid problem and determined treatment for that diagnosis in a telephone conversation with the patient. - Marschall never performed a physical examination of Patient A and did not order or perform the standard laboratory tests used for appropriate diagnosis of thyroid malfunction. Despite this, in January 1994, he prescribed a synthetic thyroid hormone (liothyronine) that was mailed to patient A from Bellgrove Pharmacy in Bellevue, Washington. - In 1995, Marschall diagnosed and treated between 75 and 100 long-distance patients for \"functional hypothyroidism\" solely via telephone, online computer services, and/or by mail. He prescribed liothyronine for at least five of them who resided in states other than Washington. - The standard recommended dosage of liothyronine is between 25 and 75 micrograms per day. Marschall prescribed dosages as great as 300 micrograms per day, with about 25% of his \"functional hypothyroidism\" patients receiving doses greater than 200 micrograms per day. Excessive ingestion of liothyronine is hazardous and can result in death. Unprofessional conduct, as defined by Washington's laws and regulations, includes conduct that \"creates an unreasonable risk that a patient may be harmed.\" [5] During the proceedings, Marschall claimed that he had based his diagnosis of Patient A on laboratory records obtained from the Kaiser Foundation Hospital/Kaiser Permanente Medical Group. However, Kaiser personnel stated that the records were not requested until 1998, and Patient A stated that she had not signed any release for Marschall to get her records [6]. In 1998, the Washington State Department of Health suspended Marschall's license for 30 months with the provision that he could continue practicing if he did not treat out-of-state patients without physically examining them and treating them in tandem with a health-care professional from the state where the patient resides. He also agreed to pay a $3,000 administrative fine and to permit a Health Department investigator to audit records and review what he was doing twice a year for a two-year period [7]. The proceedings did not address whether \"Wilson's syndrome\" is a genuine entity or whether the factual details in the complaint were accurate. Criminal Prosecution In February 2009, customs agents intercepted a package of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) that was addressed to Marschall from India. To be properly labeled, HCG must contain a warning that it has not been demonstrated effective for the treatment of obesity. The FDA then sent Marschall a detention notice which said that the drug was improperly labeled and would be released to him only if he provided a good reason to believe that the product complied with the law. He replied: I am an endocrinologist, a hormone expert. I use Human Chorionic Gonadotropin to treat infertile patients. I require it in 5,000 units ampules most of the time. Some times use 10,000 unit ampules which I can get from American pharmaceutical manufacturers. But American manufacturers do not make 5,000 unit ampules. HCG has only a 60 day shelf life so when I need 5,000 unit ampules to treat over a longer period of time I must purchase them from pharmaceutical manufacturers who make it that way and they happen to be in other countries. I have been in practice 23 years and I have a lot of experience with HCG. The HCG that I get from these suppliers works just as well as the HCG I get from US manufacturers and cost about the same. I hope you will release my shipment soon, I have several patients in need of treatment. If I can answer any other questions you have please email me [8]. The FDA did not release the shipment to Marschall. In July 2009, customs agents detained a similar HCG shipment and sent Marschall another detention notice. Despite these notices, Marschall ordered (and received) illegally manufactured HCG from a compounding pharmacy in Florida\u2014which FDA investigators found by searching the trash picked up at his clinic. In 2010, federal agents searched Marschall's clinic and seized computers, patient files, and dozens of boxes of HCG. During the search, Marschall falsely told FDA official that he prescribed HCG for infertility. However, his Web site stated that he used it for weight-loss. (In fact, in 2009 and 2010, the site claimed that users of his HCG-Slim program would \"lose a pound a day and keep it off for life.\") In 2011, Marschall was charged with one count of causing the introduction of misbranded drugs. [9].Shortly afterward, he entered a guilty plea in which he acknowledged that he had lied to the FDA [10]. The court sentenced him to 2 years supervised release and ordered to provide 250 hours of community service and pay a $2,000 fine plus a $100 special assessment. At the sentencing hearing, Marschall told the judge: It is clear to me that I made a mistake by ordering HCG over the Internet. I will say in my defense that HCG is something that has been used in the world since the 1930s, and it has been used for heart disease and rheumatoid problems, prostatic hypertrophy, for immune system disregulation, as well as for weight loss. I have been using it for all those different things. So when my sources in America were unable to provide me\u2014and I contacted every possible compounding pharmacy from California to the East Coast to try to get HCG through my normal channels. I never ordered off of the Internet for any other reason than this. I felt, knowing that it was at least a misdemeanor to do so, that in my belief system, according to the philosophy I was trained under at the University of Santa Clara, you can break a civil law in pursuit of a higher moral law. So in my opinion, in my belief at the time, getting HCG for patients who had benign prostatic hypertrophy, who were struggling with cancer as well as weight problems and an inability to get pregnant and heart disease and several of the conditions that this amazing compound, this natural compound was providing benefit for, if they couldn't supply\u2014if the three American manufacturing suppliers couldn't provide it for me and the Canadians had documented safety evidence for their HCG, which is what they told me and what I was aware of from other sources and other patients who were getting it from the same place, then I did break the law and I did do that. And as soon as\u2014I guess you might say some people would have said to me that you are a victim of your own success, meaning about the 13th clinic that I could ascertain by 2008 to provide HCG for any reason, other than undescended testicles and infertility which the FDA has approved it for. I was training other doctors around\u2014some of my fellow naturopathic doctors who are endocrinology trained in our own way. They started ordering, and we couldn't get it domestically, so in fact we got it this way, not just myself, but as many Americans do, when they can't get their own pharmaceutical drugs that they either can't get or afford, they do it through that way. I was looking for another source and within just several months, it came available in Florida. And at the time the FDA actually took my HCG, they took domestic HCG from my clinic, a thousand dollars worth which they never returned, and it only has a shelf life of six months, so that's the case. I guess if I had to do it over again, I wouldn't have done it. It was a mistake. Look what it has gotten me into here. Even with the benefit of these patients, I broke the law. So I don't intend to ever do that again, ever [11]. Further Government Actions In 2012, following his conviction, the Washington Department of Health (DOH) charged Marschall with unprofessional conduct [12 ]. The charges included (a) improperly representing himself as a \"bariatric endocrinologist\" and (b) being convicted for trafficking in human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), which he was illegally prescribing as a weight loss drug. The charges were settled with an agreed order under which: - Marschall admitted that between 2008 and 2010, he prescribed HCG to approximately 170 patients who lived outside of Washington State and had never seen him in person. - The DOH fined him $10,000, suspended his license for at least one year, ordered him to take continuing education courses in ethics, endocrinology, and obesity. - Marschall was ordered to remove references to HCG from his Web site and indicate that all new patients must be examined during their initial visit. - If his license is reinstated, he must serve seven years on probation with semi-annual record audits for one year and annual audits for four years [13]. In 2014, while his license was under suspension, the board learned that Marschall was still holding himself out as a practicing naturopath, soliciting patients, and prescribing drugs. In fact, pages on archive.org indicate that he continuously advertised naturopathic services at his Natural Healing Clinic until at least the end of 2014 [14]. In September 2015, he signed an agreed order that required him to pay a $5,000 fine and permanently cease and desist from practicing naturopathy in the State of Washington without a requisite health credential [15]. However, he continued doing business as \"Rick Marschall, N.D.\" at his Natural Healing Clinic. The clinic Web site stated: After 31 years I have retired from prescriptive practice. I have let go of my license to practice medicine or naturopathic medicine in the State of Washington and I am not licensed to prescribe prescription drugs in the State of Washington or plan to do so anywhere else. I have learned how to help people with significant health challenges in a more effective, sustainable and inexpensive way without the need for drugs for most issues. Read on and then call me at no charge to discuss whether this diet and lifestyle change is of interest to you [16]. The treatments mentioned on his site included \"nutritional counseling,\" \"sex hormone balancing,\" \"constitutional homeopathic energy medicine,\" investigators found that he was still prescribing HCG to patients. In 2017, Marschall pleaded guilty to introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce and was fined $2.000 and sentenced to two months in prison to be followed by one year of supervised release. Documents in the case state: - Between February 2014 and February 2017, Marschall prescribed HCG to about 60 individuals for weight loss. - Marschall obtained the HGH from various compounding pharmacies by lying about the states of his license and DEA registration number. - In September 2016, two Washington Department of Health investigators went undercover as patients and listened as Marschall touted HCG for weight-loss and described how he would set up a program of injections for them. - Later that fall, Marschall communicated via email with an undercover FDA criminal investigator, conducted a one-hour telephone screening, and, without meeting or examining the patients, mailed HCG to her at a cost of $550 for a one-month supply [17,18]. In 2018, Marschall signed an agreed order under which Marschall admitted that he had been practicing naturopathy illegally since 2013. The order also \"permanently enjoined from the practice of naturopathic medicine, and from representing himself as a naturopathic physician or using the initials 'ND', the title 'doctor' or 'naturopath', or any other similar title, without the requisite health care credential [19]. However, he continued to market himself himself a \"health coach\" and \"retired\" naturopath. In March 2020, FDA criminal investigators began reviewing complaints from the public about postings on In October 2021, following a 4-day trial, Marshall was convicted for the third time of distributing misbranded products [21]. In March 2022, Marschall was sentenced top eight months in prison plus one year of supervised release. In asking for a prison sentence, the prosecutors wrote to the court: For decades, Marschall lied and broke the law to provide unapproved treatments and healthcare services. Marschall lied to patients. He lied to authorities. He treated patients without examining them. And he prescribed substances in unusually large doses. Marschall repeated that dangerous playbook in this case: lying to the undercover agent about his credentials, treating her and her children over the phone without a physical exam, and recommending an extremely high dose of his drug.\" [22] References - Wilson ED.

Volume 16, Issue #6 BARRETT TESTIFIES FOR NCAHF ON HATCH BILL Dr. Stephen Barrett testified on behalf of NCAHF before the House of Representatives Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies on Oct. 18. Barrett reviewed and documented the current deceptive public relations campaign by the health food industry to block the passage of reform legislation that would strengthen consumer protection by increasing the enforcement power of the FDA (and FTC). Barrett stated that after having observed the health food industry for many years that he has come to consider it as \"a form of organized crime.\" Comment: It has been amazing to have watched over the past ten years how the Congress has identified the nature and extent of the problem of quackery in the nation [1-3] constructed the 1990 Nutrition Labeling & Education Act as a partial remedy, and now how its members are being duped by the very people who are major sources of the original problem. If the Hatch-Richardson bill is passed, it will represent the greatest setback to consumer protection law since the 1906 Pure Food & Drug Act. Some segments of the media seem to be catching on to the fact that this legislation represents major destruction to consumer rights. We believe that the longer this debate lasts, the better chance there is that the propaganda efforts of the health food industry can be neutralized.

AAP TAKES POSITION ON ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has taken the position that it \"cannot recommend or support any therapies or treatments for pediatric patients that are not clearly supported by conventional scientific research.\" AAP Media Alert, 10/18/93 THE DECEPTIVE PLACEBO Researchers evaluated five treatment modalities that seemed to work under clinical conditions but whose effects disappeared under controlled clinical trials. Under uncontrolled conditions the procedures all elicited reports of about 70% improvement (40% excellent, 30% good). Physicians as well as patients were fooled by the apparent benefits. The authors dub these clinical illusions \"the power of nonspecific effects in healing.\" Such are generally dubbed placebo effects (ie, beneficial responses due to the ACT of treatment rather than the treatment itself). The term \"nonspecific effects\" is good because it corrects the misconception of a single mechanism at work in placebos. The most common misconception is that the patient must believe in the procedure for the placebo effect to occur. This is not true. Other factors such as operant conditioning (previous experience wit h healing acts), suggestibility, expectation, and many more may be operating. In fact, more than 30 variables are known to affect placebo responses. This well-conceived study supports the need for double-blind studies, and helps explain why some health professionals fall into quackery. (Roberts, et al. Clinical Psychology Review, 1993;13:375-91) Comment: Its not enough to say, \"Who cares if it is just placebo, so long as it works.\" The problem is that the treatment may not have worked at all, and we need to know the difference between perception and reality. The reality is that aside from placebo effects, people feel better due to natural cycles in symptoms or normal healing with the passage of time. In some instances, patients have not improved, but clinic-ians following the old adage \"seek and ye shall find whether its there or not\" have reported illusory improvements based upon their expectations.

The product has been sold by mail mostly through ads in gay-oriented newspapers-a month's supply going for $195. (FTC News, 10/5/93) REPORTING ADVERSE REACTIONS TO PILLS AND DEVICES Medical Abstracts points out that it took less than 4 months for the FDA to withdraw temafloxacin from the market, but 4 years to withdraw the guar gum product Calban. Both produced adverse effects including death. The difference was the presence of a functional reporting system for prescription drugs versus the slowness of reporting of the adverse effects of the over-the-counter products. An FDA survey indicates that 50% of all doctors aren't aware that they should report adverse drug and medical device reactions to the FDA. The FDA has introduced a program called MedWatch that is designed to speed up and increase adverse-event reporting by doctors, pharmacists, nurses and other health providers. The simpler one-page report form replaces 5 other forms and uses a single address: 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852-9787; 1-800-FDA- 0178. Since reporting is voluntary, consumers may have to insist that adverse reactions be reported by the provider to whom they complain. NIH OFFICE OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE MAKES GRANTS The NIH Office of Alternative Medicine has funded a number of projects that will look into unusual methods of healing. Included among the grants are some real eyebrow- raisers. For instance, Lawrence Kushi will study macrobiotics and cancer. Curiously, Michio Kushi, the investigator's father, is the primary proponent of macrobiotics. A New Mexico physician will investigate intercessory prayer; a New Jersey MD will try Qi Gong (mystical hand waving?) on reflex sympathetic dystrophy; and a California PhD will investigate homeopathy and health. The grants are being criticized for their use of limited public funding on projects of dubious scientific value while those within mainstream science are denied. In addition to the value to science debate, it is reported that Frank Wiewel and Ralph Moss, both of whom built their notoriety by promoting dubious cancer therapies, have attempted to get Barrie Cassileth, PhD, ousted from the NIH panel because she is a member of the American Cancer Society's national Committee on Questionable Methods of Cancer Management. They charge that the ACS committee's function is to debunk questionable cancer procedures. Cassileth retorts that Moss and Wiewel are \"true believers\" who are trying to \"purify the panel of those who do not blindly accept the value of a product or practice simply because it is termed 'alternative'.\" (The Chronicle of Higher Education, 9/15/93, pp.A32-3) UNSOUND THEORIES & CLAIMS OF CHELATION THERAPY Saul Green describes the history, theories, and evidence regarding chelation therapy (CT) for vascular disorders in Nutrition Forum (Sept-Oct). This useful article covers the dubious safety of CT (proponents play down its risks), and rebuts each of four mechanisms of action by promoters to explain how CT supposedly works. The results of past and status of current studies are also presented. Comment: CT is one of the remedies NCAHF is most often asked about by people considering the procedure as an option to standard care. Dr. Green's article provides the most useful review we have seen on this important topic. HOW WILL NIH/OAM CONTROL PATHOLOGICAL SCIENCE? Pathological science encompasses fraud, crankism, and the more subtle wishful science in which true-believers use science to \"prove\" what they already are certain is true. Wishful scientists gather proof like an attorney, piling up positive data for their case, and while discarding and impugning any data that do not fit the paradigm. Students of pathological science know that it is nearly impossible to catch a cheat or to find where true believers have distorted the data. The gold standard of science that ultimately uncovers pathological science is the failure of attempts to replicate the studies. The question that must be asked about the NIH grants is who will validate these studies by attempting to reproduce them? Will people with no ideological interest be willing to devote the time and effort to a dubious method that has alleged to have been proved of value by a true believer whose results are just what an outside observer would expect? Hopefully, there will be competent researchers willing to undertake such tasks, but the chances are slim since good researchers usually have a full agenda and are not inclined to do research in unfamiliar areas. Our fear is that the research will gain NIH's status and be used to promote quackery. SUSAN POWTER Susan Powter, a spectacle of a woman with a bleached crew-cut and manic activity level, is the latest exercise and health guru attracting media attention. Connie Chung featured Powter on Eye To Eye (10/18). Powter, who is known for her high amplification, mixes her messages to women about taking charge of their lives by doing something drastic about the man who is messing them up, exercising vigorously, and eating a high volume, very low-fat diet. Looking like Twiggy on steroids, she is a screeching dynamo in the style of the Juiceman. Powter makes her ignorance a virtue by proclaiming that she is not a doctor, nutritionist or dietitian and doesn't wanna-be. She spouts nutrition nonsense about food \"chemicals,\" advocates vegetarian extremism, and other nonsense. Available from NCAHF is The American Dietetic Association's review of Powter's Stop the Insanity program pointing out its positive and negative aspects. SASE +$1. SEN. HATCH GROWS BOLDER AS HE HAWKS HIS LEGISLATION Senator Orrin Hatch attempted to justify his legislation that would permit a largely unregulated marketplace for supplement hucksters on CBS Morning News on Oct 19. Hatch charged that the FDA wanted to prevent people from getting beneficial supplements, specifically, folic acid for neural tube defects and vitamin E for heart disease, plus, he alleged that his bill would help reduce national health care costs. This has no basis. A 1992 study of 10,758 Americans found no longevity benefit and questioned the cost-effectiveness of supplement taking [1]. His complaint that the FDA does not allow health claims for folic acid to prevent neural tube defects does not justify his bill that would create a snake-oil marketplace for supplements. Hatch's praise of vitamin E reflects recent vitamin-sellers hype, not the established value of vitamin E, and like other vitamin salespeople, he ignores its risks [2]. Incredibily, Hatch is huckstering for the very industry that government studies have revealed is a big part of the nation's multibillion dollar quackery problem. His self-interest is obvious and blatant. Not only does he have a personal financial interest in the industry, but now the health food industry is raising campaign funds for him [3]. Hatch may not realize that he is ingloriously writing himself into the history of quackery in America. [Citations:(1) Kim, et al. AJPH, 1993;83:546-50; (2) Roberts. Medical World News, 3/93, p.71; (3) Health Foods Business, 9/93, p.10] FARMER SELLS MILK CURE A southern Minnesota dairy farmer, Herbert Saunders, has run into legal difficulties because of claims that his milk cures AIDS, Lyme disease, cancer, diabetes and other ailments. Customers had to first buy a cow at $2,500 and then pay up to $35 a bottle for its milk. Saunders reportedly injects a sample of a patient's blood into the cow's udder; and, theoretically, the cow forms antibodies which become part of its colostrum. This theory is said to have been tested by the Univ. of Minnesota in the 1950s with inconclusive results. Saunders defends his actions with familiar arguments; testimonials, his sincerity, and the hope it offers. (Minneapolis Star Tribune, 9/22/93) IMMUNOAUGMENTATIVE THERAPY EXPOSED Saul Green, PhD, has come up with another penetrating, insightful critique of so-called \"Immunoaugmentative Therapy\" (IAT) a dubious cancer treatment created by the late zoologist, Lawrence Burton, PhD, which Victor Herbert, MD, has described as neither \"immuno- augmentative\" nor \"therapy.\" Green details the history of its proponent's theory and how it came to be available in the Bahamas as a treatment. Burton's original work was disclaimed by his collaborator. The chemistry of IAT materials does not make sense, and some were found to have HIV contamination. The facts presented not only discredit IAT, but cast great doubt upon its underlying hypothesis that the immune system plays a major role in cancer's etiology. This article is a splendid piece that will take its place among classical refutations of pathological science and pseudo-medicine. (JAMA, 1993;270:1719-23) Dr. Green is a biochemist who did cancer research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for 23 years. He consults on scientific methodology and has a special interest in questionable medical procedures. Green is a member of the NCAHF Board of Directors. RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF SPINAL MANIPULATION The risk/benefit of spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) was analyzed on the basis of 140 case reports by researchers at the Department of Neuroscience, Division of Neurosurgery, University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria. Six risk factors (misdiagnosis, failure to recognize the onset or progression of neurological signs and symptoms, improper technique, SMT performed in the presence of contraindications, and manipulation of the cervical spine) are identified. The review notes that despite flawed designs, SMT demonstrates consistent value for acute low-back pain, and coupled with low risk, is acceptable as a treatment. However, the risk/benefit ratio was judged as unacceptably high for patients with nerve root symptoms or signs associated with prolapsed discs and neck pain. Potential complications and unknown benefits indicate that SMT should not be used for children. (Neurosurgery, 1993;33:73-79) CHEMICAL SENSITIVITIES Multiple chemical sensitivities has been proposed as a new disease in which the victim has adverse reactions when exposed to various substances under ordinary circumstances which do not affect the general population. The hypothesis has generated a cadre of fringe practitioners calling themselves clinical ecologists, a following of patients, and a genre of attorneys and expert witnesses who have managed to hit several industries for some large deep pocket lawsuits. The media's attention on the environment, the strident claims of environmental activists, and the general concern for the environment taught by schools, public broadcasting, and so forth, have created a psychosocial setting that plays to a kind of mass hysteria one might label environmental anxiety disorder. This is not meant to poke fun at sufferers whose symptoms are very real, and must be taken seriously. In a report titled \"Immuno-logic, psychological, and neuropsycho-logical factors in multiple chemical sensitivity,\" (Annals Intern Med, 1993;19: 97-103) researchers say that immunologic testing did not differentiate patients with chemical sensitivities from controls, but such patients did exhibit a higher prevalence of current anxiety or depressive disorder (44 v 15%). These disorders did not appear to precede the onset of chemical sensitivity, and 25% of patients showed no current psychological disturbance. 25% of cases (no controls) satisfied criteria for somatization disorder. Researchers conclude that psychological symptoms, though not causal, are a central component of chemical sensitivity. Comment: It is interesting that a substantial portion of sufferers do not exhibit psychological disorders. For some insight into what behavioral factors may be at work in such patients see \"Allergy-related quackery\" (NY State J Med, 1993; 93:100-04) which describes how the power of the imagination, operant conditioning, and practitioner influence can reinforce imaginary sensitivities. CORRECTION July-August, 1993 we reported that a lawsuit, filed by two UC Berkeley cultologists against the American Psychological Association and the American Sociological Association alleging that several top executives had attempted to destroy their careers through various improper actions, had been settled. We have learned that the case remains unsettled. PROSTATA Full-page ads that appear to have been torn out of a newspaper (page numbers \"D14\" and \"D15\" appear along with the date \"Thursday, April 22, 1993,\" but the top corner where the newspaper's name would appear is cut off) are hawking Prostata, a product that claims to prevent or treat prostate disorders and act as an aphrodisiac. The product contains zinc and pyridoxine; the herbs: serenoa (aka, saw palmetto and alanine and glutamic acid; bee pollen, and silica. Familiar names and faces dot the ad. \"Dr. KW Donsbach\" is quoted as reporting on a double-blind study. A mug shot of \"Dr.\" Earl Mindell appears. Also Dr. Hans Kugler (PhD[?]) who's been hawking anti- aging products for years in such publications as the Health Freedom News (ie, the \"hang on to your wallet\" news). Prostata, a product of Life Force, Inc, (Cheyenne, WY) is listed in the FDA's publication Unsub-stantiated Claims and Documented Health Hazards in the Dietary Supplement Marketplace, July, 1993, that \"demonstrates the pervasiveness of the problem posed by dietary supplements.\" *Diuretics can create an illusion of effectiveness by increasing urination frequency or irritation. CHIROS TREATING CHILDREN In July, 1993, Paul E. Brown, MD, did a phone survey of 100 chiropractic offices in the Minneapolis- St.Paul area. Posing as a parent with a 4-yr-old child with ear problems, he asked five questions to office personnel or available chiros: Do you treat children? (99% yes) Do you treat ear infections? (80% yes) Do you treat allergies? (69% yes) Do you sell vitamin supplements from your office? (78% yes) Do you do applied kinesiology (21% yes) Some chiros told him that the first cervical vertebra is often out of place and that this affects nerves and blood so that ear problems occur. Others said that dietary practices such as using cow's milk leads to excessive mucous which contributes to the problem.

FOOD TECHNOLOGISTS FOR FDA SUPPLEMENT REGULATION The Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) have submitted commentary on the scientific issues raised by HR 1709, Richardson's Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1993 (companion to Sen. Hatch's bill) which provides details as to why supplements should not be permitted to by-pass established FDA procedures for assuring safety and efficacy for health claims. The 12-page document provides information of substance for anyone desiring details on why the Hatch-Richardson legislation should be defeated. NYC CONSUMER AFFAIRS CHARGES DIET- PILL COMPANIES Acting Commissioner Richard Schrader announced on October 27 that the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs was charging seven diet-pill companies with \"telling fat lies in magazine and newspaper ads.\" Among the phone claims were: \"the power to block the absorption of calories and the guarantee of effortless weight loss even while continuing to consume a diet rich in fat and calories.\" Six of the seven ads were found in national women's magazines, one was in a supplement to the Daily News. The companies and products charged were: - Hanover Labs, Inc. Livingston, NJ (Lipo/trim) - Martrim, Lawrence, KS (Martrim) - Prolab Nutrition, Berlin, CT (Tight and Firm capsules) - Universal, New Brunswick, NJ (Tone 'N Tighten anti- cellulite formula - Body by Jay Fitness Enterprises, Santee, CA (Fat Burning System) - America's Best Nutritionals, Destin, FL (Trim Now) - World Wide Marketing, Hollywood, CA (Nutra Trim 7) The companies have been directed to contact the department's legal division to answer the charges. They face substantial fines for multiple violations plus the costs of investigation, and will be expected to agree to desist from further violations. Contact persons: Linda Sachs or Pat Cohen at 212-487-4270. UNIV. OF COLORADO BOARD OF REGENTS TO SCRUTINIZE THERAPEUTIC TOUCH The University of Colorado Board of Regents has announced that it will conduct an inquiry into the teaching of Therapeutic Touch (TT) by its School of Nursing. TT has been under public scrutiny by the Rocky Mountain Skeptics (RMS), a nonprofit group, for the past two years. RMS is concerned about the make-up of the board of inquiry because several TT proponents have been included on the board of inquiry. RMS fears that proponent's influence may dilute or stymie efforts to hold nursing education to a scientific standard in this matter. The board's findings could establish a landmark in the standards of quality assurance in health care. RMS failed to stop the acceptance of TT course work for continuing nursing education by the Colorado Board of Nursing in 1992, but succeeded in focusing public attention on this dubious practice.

Volume 19, Issue #6 COLLOIDAL SILVER PRODUCTS WIDELY CONDEMNED Colloidal silver is being huckstered as a superior germ fighter by a number of promoters, including the wacky naturopath-veterinarian Joel Wallach. NCAHF reported that a permanent skin discoloration known as argyria can result from ingesting too much silver. Now, even the National Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA) is warning health food dealers and consumers that colloidal silver products have not been proved either safe or effective (NNFA Today, Oct, 1996). Of this, NCAHF president William Jarvis says, \"Pinch me, I must be dreaming!\" Since when does the NNFA worry about unproved safety or efficacy? NNFA was a driving force behind the passage of the Hatch Bill forbidding the FDA from regulating dietary supplements on the basis of safety or efficacy. Most NNFA members live off of the selling of health products that are unproved. \"Let's hope that this new-found concern over public health and safety extends itself to other health food products,\" Jarvis says. In addition to the NNFA criticism, a consumer named Rosemary Jacobs of Derby Line, Vermont, has filed a citizen's petition with the FDA asking that all orally-administered products containing colloidal silver be required to carry a warning label. Jacobs asked the FDA to consider banning all ingestible products containing silver unless the manufacturers can prove that they are effective. (Food Chemical News, 10/14/96) YAM PRODUCTS Taking hormone supplements is a current fad. People are ingesting melatonin, DHEA, human growth hormone, testosterone, etc, with a startling lack of fear. Among the popular items on the growing list are Mexican yam supplements that are alleged to become the building blocks for DHEA or progesterone. By way of background, in the not-too-distant past the main source of steroid hormones was animal glands. This was not efficient because the amounts were very small-it took 625 kg of ovaries from 50,000 sows to produce 20 mg of pure crystalline progesterone. In 1943, it was found that Mexican yams (Dioscorea species) were rich in steroidal sapogenins that could be converted to progesterone. This hormone and the process used to prepare it were the foundation stones of the Syntex Company (Pharmacognosy, 1988, p.175). Mexican yam became the principle raw material from which birth control pills (ie, \"the pill\") are made. Now the health food industry is peddling Mexican yam supplements as a \"natural\" way for women to avoid post menopausal estrogen therapy, and for others to provide their bodies with the building blocks of DHEA. People do not stop to think that any substance that actually has a hormonal effect upon the body is potentially dangerous and must be carefully monitored. The difference is that the legitimate drug companies are fulfilling their duty to warn users of their products of potential adverse effects while the health food promoters are not. Worse, they make \"natural\" seem to be synonymous with \"safe\" when it is not. Now comes a report from Aeron LifeCycles Laboratory which says that Mexican yam-containing products do not contain, nor act as precursors to, progesterone, progestin, or DHEA. (Townsend Letter, 10/96, p.104) This is good news on the safety front, but still leaves users as victims of another dietary supplement hoax. NEBRASKA OUTLAWS EPHEDRA DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS In July, the Nebraska State Legislature enacted a law that categorizes products containing ephedra as prescription only. Exempted are FDA-approved over-the-counter products. The Nebraska law is a reaction to the irresponsible 1994 Dietary Supplements Health & Education Act (DSHEA) which stripped consumers of protection from hazardous dietary supplements. It only deals with one dangerous substance being hawked by the health food industry, but it shows how states can undo the folly of bad laws passed by Congress. Obviously, what is needed is a total repeal of the DSHEA, but with the industry willing to throw big money at our lawmakers, the chance of getting the right thing done is slim. The industry is reported to have given $2.5 million to lawmakers \"to get its message across.\" GNC REMOVES EPHEDRINE PRODUCTS General Nutrition Centers has removed products containing ephedrine from its 2,700 stores due to the bad publicity the substance has been receiving in the press, which had led to a 20% drop in the value of GNC stock. Ephedra products make up about 6% of GNC's business. GNC is asking its manufacturers to reformulate products. Although a company spokesman declared that GNC was \"erring on the side of safety by removing ephedrine,\" NCAHF suspects that the fact that several states have banned ephedrine products following many deaths that have been linked to the substance is a major factor in GNC's decision. As a national chain it is important to have standard products that can be marketed in all states. (FDA Hotline, October, 1996) Comment: In some products ephedrine is being replaced with phenylalanine. According to Graedon's Best Medicine, (Bantam, 1991) \"There may be a risk of hypertension with l-phenylalanine, so this amino acid should not be taken unless under a physician's supervision.\" Graedon says that l-phenylalanine also carries a possible risk of malignant melanoma, which is no small matter to sun-loving health enthusiasts who make up an important segment of consumers of such products. Many products continue to contain caffeine in substantially higher doses than a cup of coffee. CHIROPRACTIC CENTER AT NIH On September 30, President Clinton signed into law the 1997 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act which includes nearly $1 million for the continuation of the \"chiropractic demonstration grants program.\" Under the 4-year-old program, chiropractic colleges conduct collaborative demonstration projects with DCs and MDs working together to diagnose and treat spinal and lower back conditions. The bill also establishes a Chiropractic Center within the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine. The primary political support for these developments came from Senators Arlen Spector (R-PA) and Tom Harkin (D-IA). Both states have chiropractic colleges. (Dynamic Chiropractic, 11/18/96) Comment: Up to now chiropractic had been largely left out of the discussion on \"alternative\" and \"complementary\" medicine at NIH. Having a designated center now catapults it ahead of some of the other guilds. This is an important, and possibly constructive development. The American Medical Associations 1997 edition of Physician's Current Procedural Terminology now includes an identification code for \"chiropractic manipulative treatment\" to \"influence joint and neurophysiological function.\" Although some may view this development as another example of the degradation of evidence-based medicine, there is some reason for optimism. The more association chiropractic has with standard health care, the more limited it becomes in its scope of practice. Chiropractic's future lies in treating low back pain, less neck rotation (because of the unjustifiable risk/benefit ratio), and an abandonment of the subluxation concept. In isolation, chiropractic got crazier. In association with standard medicine, it will become more sound. PATIENTS CAN HELP DETECT HEALTH INSURANCE FRAUD Fraudulent pharmacy practices, such as short counting prescriptions, can steal millions from Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance companies. Patients should count the number of pills in a bottle carefully to be sure they are getting the prescribed amount. If a pharmacy does not provide the full prescription and asks you to return for the remainder, be sure to do it and check the count. Always ask your doctor for the total number of pills being prescribed and match it with the number from the pharmacy. If the prescription is marked for refills, be sure to get them when the time is due. Ointments and creams should be checked for size. For example, the patient may receive a 15 g tube while the company is billed for a larger size. Medicaid and Medicare are said to be the most vulnerable to such fraudulent practices. This is the type of fraud that is least likely to attract attention of the anti-fraud agencies. It is small time stuff to them but costs the nation many millions. Only alert consumers can police such practices. RAND FINDS LITTLE JUSTIFICATION FOR NECK MANIPULATION The Rand Corporation conducted a review of the appropriateness of manipulation and mobilization of the cervical spine employing the same technique it had used to evaluate spinal manipulative therapy for back pain. A panel of nine judges (4 DCs, 4 MDs, and 1 MD/DC) rated cervical manipulation for appropriateness for specified clinical conditions. Each scenario was rated twice-once individually, and then again after a group discussion. A scale of 1 to 9 was used to judge appropriateness based upon the evaluator's opinion of its benefit-risk ratio. Only 11.1% of 736 indications for cervical manipulation were judged appropriate. The most important finding was the paucity of evidence for the benefit of these procedures. The risks of cervical spine manipulation are well documented. Estimates of risk run from as low as 1 in 40,000 manipulations for mild complications, to 1 in one million for serious complications. [Coulter, et al. The Appropriateness of Manipulation and Mobilization of the Cervical Spine. Santa Monica, CA, Rand Corp, 1996] Comment: Although the report discussed the differences between mobilization and manipulation (the latter is more forceful with extension and rotation), there was insufficient attention paid to differences in the risks of these procedures. NCAHF contends that, since neck stiffness and/or soreness are self-limited, and that there is no important medical benefit to neck manipulation, any risk of stroke or paralysis-no matter how small-is unacceptable. Even if the risk is 1 in one million, the thought of 50,000 chiros nationwide doing 20 to 40 manipulations each working day presents the nightmare of 1-2 patients a day experiencing completely avoidable strokes or paralysis. Given the history of chiropractic silence on its shortcomings, and an ideology that teaches that everyone will benefit from having his or her neck \"cracked,\" NCAHF can only repeat its strong warning against neck manipulation. KENNEY PICKS A BONE WITH THE ZONE The TV tabloid shows are gushing about the latest food fad in Hollywood: going for \"the zone\" as promoted in the book by the same title written by Barry Sears, PhD (biochemistry, Indiana University). \"The zone,\" Dr. Sears claims, is a \"nearly euphoric metabolic state\" in which athletes perform their best, those with weight problems lose their bulk, and all will reduce their risks of serious diseases. Sears recommends a 40% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 30% protein diet to live in the zone. Sears contends that the high complex carbohydrate, low fat diets recommended by Pritikin and Ornish, are dangerous. This has prompted NCAHF vice president, James Kenney, PhD (Rutgers), a nutritionist at the Pritikin Longevity Center, to respond in detail. Lest readers accuse Kenney of financial conflict of interest, please bear in mind that Sears not only is selling his book but also has a line of BioZone snack bars that will cost users about $40 per week if they follow the \"Spartacus Quick Start Plan.\" Kenney's critique fills the entire 8 pages of the Sept-Oct Nutrition & Health Forum (formerly Nutrition Forum). Bonnie Liebman didn't like The Zone either. Her 3-page critique appeared in the July-August, 1996 issue of Nutrition Action. Both give credit and criticism alike on similar points, but for dietitians and nutritionists who want the details, Kenney's critique has 56 references. CHROMIUM PICOLINATE PROMOTERS SETTLE FTC FALSE ADVERTISING CHARGES The Federal Trade Commission announced settlements with three California companies charged with making unsupported claims about weight loss and health benefits for chromium picolinate. The companies, Nutrition 21, Body Gold, and Universal Merchants, were unable to provide solid scientific evidence to back their claims. [FTC News Notes, 11/4/96] CAN STANDARD MEDICINE EMPLOY \"ALTERNATIVE\" & \"COMPLEMENTARY\" MEDICINE WITHOUT LIABILITY? Trial lawyers should be licking their chops as naive hospital administrators rush to market alternative medicine because it is a fad. The reason is that when things go badly standard medicine cannot be protected from legal liability in the same way nonstandard practitioners have in the past. An investigation of why the attorneys who have managed to make a good living off of medical malpractice cases haven't been able to make a dent in the problem of quackery uncovered some important reasons why patients this is so. Deep Pockets Lawyers pursue \"deep pockets,\" and off-beat practitioners avoid looking like good target. Many do not carry insurance, a fact that they inform patients about by posting signs in their offices (patients are not always warned but find out after the fact). In a sad case in which a woman was paralyzed from the neck down by a chiropractor, she found that he had no insurance whatever because he had crippled 2 others and could not buy insurance. Most of his assets were in his wife's name, and his worth was only about $50,000. No attorney was willing to do all of the necessary work for such a paltry collectible award. Differing standards of conduct Acupuncturists, chiropractors, naturopaths, etc, do not practice medicine; therefore, they cannot be held to medical standards. Case: An Oregon woman fell on her tail bone. She went to a chiropractor instead of a physician. He x-rayed her back, but didn't see the fracture. After some time, she developed chronic, severe back pain. A physician found that the failure to immobilize her fractured vertebra had caused bone spurs to develop. She sued but lost because, in the eyes of the law she had gotten what she had paid for-she had chosen the chiropractor \"at her own risk.\" Other chiropractors had testified that he had followed standard practice for chiropractors. This defense won't work when it can be shown that patients believed that they were chosing medicine, and that the provider knew-or ought to have known-that the safety of the \"alternative\" or \"complementary\" procedure was unproven which is inherent in the definitions of such procedures. Primum non nocere (\"above all, do no harm\") is the oldest consumer protection principle in history. Culpability For Referrals Even if patients are referred out, medical doctors or clinics referring patients to nonstandard practitioners carry a degree of responsibility if things go badly. Administrators should be alert to the fact that nonstandard practitioners generally employ a kind of \"heads I win, tails they lose\" psychology. When things go well they take the credit, but when things go badly they blame standard medicine. Alternative practitioners have traditionally substituted patient satisfaction for true clinical effectiveness. Their ability to convert patients to their way of thinking generally puts the patient on the side of the alternative practitioner when disputes arise. Barnum wisely advised, \"Never try to beat a man at his own game.\" A MOTHERING GROUND OF QUACKERY William T. Jarvis, Ph.D. During 25 years of studying quackery, I have been struck by the high proportion of major types of quackery that originated in a relatively small region of western Europe. Herbalisma, magnetic Gerson cancer therapyk, to name a few. I believe that the European tradition of alchemy which was embodied in the German alchemist, Paracelsus (1493-1541), seeker of medical remedies, is significant. Paracelsus, who was extreme in both mysticism and intelligent observation, is an icon who has inspired a devoted following of medical cranks and influential lay persons-among them Prince Charles [1]. Although already familiar with Paracelsus from my study of medical history, I had the opportunity to read Paracelsus's writings first hand while a witness in a case involving the starvation death of a 17-month-old Canadian child. The Germany-reared herbalist responsible for the tragedy was so devoted to Paracelsus that he had translated his books into English and used them as his source of authority. Medical historians give Paracelsus some credit for his views, but most of what he taught is very weird by any standard. Skrabanek said that \"Paracelsianism is fundamental to the credibility of holistic medicine, and that it is no coincidence that Paracelsus was resurrected by Nazi leaders in their promulgation of naturopathy.\" [1] Naturopathy began in the 19th century German water cure spas, and Germans today are said to be \"by far the world's leading spa-goers\" with more than 6 million going on a \"cure\" each year [2]. In Germany, 7 out of 10 general practitioners practice alternative medicine [3]. A dozen off-beat clinics in the region promote unproven cancer cures-most are in Germany. Use of unproven cancer remedies in the region are the highest ever reported: Germany (65.7%), Austria (59%), and Switzerland (52% & 70%). [4] Many of these bogus cancer remedies are available at Mexico border clinics. A large homeopathic medicine industry thrives in Europe-90,000 of the 126,000 medicines on the market in Germany are \"homeopathic and natural medicines.\" [5] The European Common (EC) Market situation forced pharmacists there to face up to the reality that homeopathy is a delusion. Even after a debate that acknowledged homeopathy's absurdities, pharmacists voted to continue selling irrational homeopathic remedies. Despite its name, the EC's European Medicines Evaluation Agency does not evaluate medicines but merely coordinates the evaluations of drugs made by EC member states [6]. Alderidge provides a description of nonstandard medicine in specific European countries [7]. It's not a pretty picture for those who believe in evidence-based medicine. The next time someone tells you about medicines that are available in Europe that our hard-nosed FDA won't allow into this country-remember its legacy of quackery. Citations.

Thus, an herb that resembles an organ or malady is useful in its cure. (b) While experimenting with the magnet, Austrian physician Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815) got the idea that the human hand possessed a similar power which he called animal magnetism (Latin anima, \"spirit\" or \"soul\"). One hundred years later a magnetic healer named Daniel Palmer invented chiropractic. (c) While living in Austria in 1790, German physician Franz Josef Gall (1757-1828), theorized that the shape of one's skull was a map that revealed personality. He and his pupil, Johann Sebastian Spurzheim (1776-1832) formulated phrenology in four treatises (1810-19). It has disappeared, but its kin, physiogamy (character is revealed in the shape of the face) is still alive. (d) In 1810, German physician Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), who earned a living translating classical works into German because he had become disillusioned by his inability to cure his patients, discovered the same primitive idea of correspondences that inspired Paracelsus.

Reich built The Orgone Energy Accumulator to treat diseases by absorbing \"blue bions\" or \"Cosmic Orgone Energy.\" The American College of Orgonomy uses and promotes Reich's methods.

NEW BOOK ON MAGNETISM PROVIDES TOOLS FOR DEBUNKING VITALISM Belief in vitalism, \"the doctrine that the functions of a living organism are due to a vital principle distinct from physicochemical forces\" (Webster's Dictionary); or, \"the theory that biological activities are directed by a supernatural force; opposed to mechanism\" (Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary) provides the conceptual underpinnings that sustains the perpetual plague of quackery. Vitalistic of the \"physicochemical forces\" despised by vitalists embraces the physics of magnetism, an understanding of which is key to debunking vitalistic psychobabble. Dr. James Livingston makes the physics of magnetism clear in his marvelous book, Driving Force (Harvard, 1996). Livingston writes in a delightfully readable style. Readers will not only learn marvelous facts about lodestones, how the earth generates its own electromagnetic field, and the role of magnetism in nearly every modern technology, but they will also see how pseudosciences have exploited the mystery of magnetism for their purposes. Livingston provides useful information on how magnets are used to deceive people for entertainment by magicians, and how these same tricks have been used by phoney psychics, such as Uri Geller, to deceive the public. Kusche wisely stated that the less a person knows about a subject, the easier it is to make it into a mystery, in his debunking of the Bermuda Triangle myth (The Bermuda Triangle Mystery-Solved, Warner, 1975). Livingston explains the lack of science and the appropriate skepticism that should be applied to magnet products that claim to treat pain and disease. Nikken, Oriental Medical Supplies, and other companies are discussed with the caveat that none of these products have proven value for anything medical. This is contrasted with understandable explanations about how the medical marvels like Magnetic Resonance Imagery, positron emission tomography, and computerized taxial tomography work. Carl Sagan has said that the appeal of pseudosciences is that they seem to provide insight into the construct of the universe and how things work. Sagan contends that the realities science uncovers are more wondrous than the fantasies of the mystics. Livingston has filled in the information we need to appreciate what Sagan was talking about. I have put Driving Force on my basic reading list for anyone who seeks the knowledge needed to attack pseudoscience and quackery at their foundations.

CHROMIUM PROMOTERS SETTLE FTC FALSE ADVERTISING CHARGES The Federal Trade Commission announced settlements with three California companies charged with making unsupported claims about weight loss and health benefits for chromium picolinate. The companies, Nutrition 21, Body Gold, and Universal Merchants, were unable to provide solid scientific evidence to back their claims.

HEALTH FRAUD CASE RESULTS IN $18 MILLION AWARD The Aetna, Metropolitan Life and Employers Health insurance companies were awarded $18 million in a civil suit against the Russian emigre brothers, the Smushkeviches, who billed $100 million through their diagnostics labs and clinics scam. The award was the first ever for health insurance fraud under the Racketeer-Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). This may set a precedent for future well-organized health fraud scams. Physicians Financial News, 4/15/90). MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR UNPROVED AIDS THERAPIES The clamor for relaxed consumer protection standards by AIDS activists is seen by some as proof that FDA law sets unreasonably high demands for new therapies for an incurable disorder. Organized quackery, which is always looking for a way to undermine consumer protection law, is attempting to capitalize on this issue. The reality is that safety and effectiveness are not absolutes but part of a benefit-risk equation. On the risk side, no one wishes to see the misery of AIDS patients increased by toxic unproved remedies. Safety demands that therapies not be more harmful than the disease itself, and this can only be known by testing. On the benefit side, cure is not the only measure of effectiveness. Such things as prolonged life, extended functional independence, improved quality of life, or reduced suffering are measurable benefits of therapies. NCAHF believes that anyone offering remedies for AIDS or ARC should be required by law to only administer these only as part of a peer-reviewed, experimental protocol that will guarantee that worthwhile information regarding their safety and effectiveness will be obtained. Requirements as to what is permitted as an experimental remedy may be reduced to only reasonable proof of safety. The only other requirement NCAHF would insist upon is that consumers be fully informed on the nature and status of the remedy. NCAHF believes that these represent the minimum level of consumer protection in a responsible society. To do less would be to abandon desperate AIDS and ARC sufferers to unjustifiable exploitation by quackery. It is essential that states pass and enforce such laws due to the fact that the Federal government is concerned only with drugs and devices in interstate commerce and does not regulate health care practitioners. DISEASE-PRONE PERSONALITY A comprehensive article examining the idea that personality plays a causal role in the development of various diseases appeared in the American Psychologist (June, 1987). Linkages between personality and disease have been proposed for asthma, headache, peptic ulcer, rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, and cancer. The article summarizes the research on these and points out some of the problems with proving the existence of such connections. With the increasing popularity of psychoneuroimmunology, and other behavioral medical theories, this article is very useful in trying to sort out sound approaches to this complex concept. NUTRITION WORKBOOK GIVES SOLID INFORMATION Human Nutrition was designed to be a supplemental workbook for college nutrition classes. It turned out to be an excellent information source for anyone who wants a practical, interesting guide to good nutrition practices. The 186-page, full-sized, wire-bound workbook is packed with facts about foods and dietary practices followed by today's kids, teenagers, young adults, athletes, fast food users, dietary abusers (eating disorders), and so forth.

CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS WANT TO RENEGE ON DIPLOMA MILL REFORMS In 1989 the California legislature passed a reform bill that would help eliminate easy degrees from \"authorized\" schools (not \"approved\" or \"accredited\"). Now one of those unaccredited colleges is pushing bills that would undo the stricter standards. Three California Senators helping in the effort reportedly are John Seymour (R-Anahiem), Cecil Green (D-Norwalk), and Ralph Dills (D-Gardena). The three have received more than $20,000 in campaign contributions from California Coast University, the correspondence school behind the effort. CCU recruits about 1,000 students annually mostly through magazine ads. Students can earn bachelor's master's and doctoral degrees in less than a year. The three legislators authored a bill that would allow unaccredited schools to say that they are comparable to state universities. Bruce D. Hamett of the State's Postsecondary Education Commission says that the bill \"provides a legal sanction for misleading advertising.\" (Santa Ana Register, 5/22/90). Comment: California has never been known for the integrity, courage or intelligence of its state legislators. FLUORIDE WILL NOT APPEAR IN NTP ANNUAL CANCER REPORT John R. Butcher, PhD, Head of General Toxicology at the Experimental Toxicology Branch of the National Toxicology Program says that the results of the sodium fluoride studies that caused such a furor this Spring will not receive mention in the NTP Sixth Annual Report on Carcinogens because listing in that document typically requires a positive response in carcinogenicity studies with two species of animals. The results of the studies they conducted were that there was no evidence of cancer in male or female mice, or in female rats, and the evidence in male rats was equivocal. (6/6/90 Letter to John Small, National Institutes for Dental Research.) PHARMACISTS' VIEWS OF \"ALTERNATIVE\" HEALTH CARE A survey to assess the perceived knowledge and usefulness, referrals and utilization of \"alternative\" health approaches (AHA's) of U.S. and British pharmacists was conducted by Nelson, Bailie and Areny of the Wayne State University College of Pharmacy (Detroit, Mich.). More than 50% of the pharmacists in both countries had 'never heard of' or 'only heard of' about half of the 21 AHA's listed. Acupuncture was felt to be the most useful AHA (U.S. 83.8%; UK 91%). Osteopathy and chiropractic were most often referrals by U.S. pharmacists (38.6% and 33.5% respectively), whereas, homeopathy (14.7%) and osteopathy (14.5%) were most often referrals by British pharmacists. The most utilized AHA's were osteopathy (21.8%) and chiropractic (19.3%) by U.S. pharmacists, and homeopathy (10.1%) and herbal medicine (6%) by the British. The authors conclude that it is essential that pharmacists become knowledgeable about AHA's because of their prominent role as dispensers of reliable health information to the public. (J Clin Pharm & Therapeutics, 15:141-146, 1990). CHRONIC FATIGUE NOT ALWAYS CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME A prospective study of 300 patients with chronic fatigue found that only six percent met the criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The most common diagnosis (61%) was major depression. Panic disorder (14%) and somatization (11%) were more common than CFS, and dysthymia was as common (also 6%). The cause of chronic fatigue was identified in 84% of the patients, and psychological diagnoses were by far the most common. The researchers concluded that psychiatric testing is the most useful diagnostic tool for patients with chronic fatigue. (Manu P, Lane TJ, Matthews DA. \"Chronic fatigue: a prospective diagnostic study of 300 patients,\" Clinical Research, 38:(2):1990 [Abstract]). USE OF DIRTY TRICK SPREADS The September-October, 1989, issue of this newsletter described a deceptive marketing tactic being employed by the promoters of Berry Trim, a dubious weight-loss product. The trick uses what appears to be a full-page newspaper ad that has been ripped out and sent by an anonymous friend. The ad arrives in an unmarked envelope. Either written in the margin or attached is a hand-written message using the recipient's first name (eg, \"Joe, try it, it works!\") signed with a single initial (eg, \"K\"). Recently, two other promotions are employing similar tactics. One is a pill called Cholestrolite that claims to \"... insure weight-loss without conventional calorie counting dieting. .\" The other is the discredited \"anti-aging formula\" Gerovital H3. The trick seems to work quite well. Many people who ask NCAHF about the product are unaware that the note is not actually from someone they know. They are often quite surprised when we explain how the deception is accomplished. SUNRIDER PAYS $175,000 FINE The Sunrider Corporation has paid a fine of $175,000 to the State of California for false advertising and unfair competition. Among the misrepresentations listed in the complaint were the claims that its product \"Nutrien\" contained \"Vitamin B-8\" a substance that doesn't exist; that Nutrien and other products have an effect upon heart disease and pneumonia; and the assertion that Sunrider products have an effect upon high blood pressure. The unfair competition charges listed the foregoing misrepresentations plus offering for sale adulterated food products (salmonella), mislabeling-including claims of more protein and less carbohydrates than products actually contained, and containing less Vitamin A than claimed. (Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, Case No. C747506, Dec. 26, 1989.) REFLEXOLOGY PSEUDOSCIENCE MAKING A COMEBACK In the mid-1970's foot reflexology was a popular fad among hippies and fringe physical therapists. In 1980, NCAHF organized a study at Loma Linda University to test the claim that existing maladies could be confirmed by sensitive spots on the feet. A reflexologist certified by a leading proponent organization examined 70 subjects who had filled out a questionnaire asking about problems experienced within the past two years in 43 different organ locations. The results failed to support reflexology's claim of an association between sensitive spots on the feet and organ pathology. John Renner, MD, covered reflexology's lack of validity in his Health Bulletin column in The Kansas City Star (10/22/89). NCAHF has prepared a single page reprint along with a schematic drawing of reflexology (also known as \"Zone Therapy\") theory. Send $1 and a SSAE. ORGANIC PRODUCE FAILING IN THE MARKETPLACE According to a report in The Sacramento Bee, organically grown produce is failing in the marketplace. The main reason seems to be high prices. Raley's, one of the first supermarkets to offer organic produce is calling the experiment a failure and is cutting back on its offering. The firm is losing money from waste. Raley's president, Charles Collings, says that the company apparently overestimated the public's real interest in such products. \"We can't afford to keep throwing it away\" said Collings. Bel Air Markets also found that despite good showings on some varieties, organic produce sales were not sustained. The alar scare was apparently responsible for the temporary successes experienced by marketers. It seems, however, that the reality of higher prices has turned many consumers off. The stores still intend to carry some organic produce, but only what demand dictates. AYURVEDIC MEDICINE Promoters are pushing hard to establish \"ayurveda\" as a marketing term for health food products and unorthodox health services. The main promoter of Ayurvedic Medicine is Deepak Chopra, MD, a follower of the East Indian guru, the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi who is the founder of the Transcendental Meditation movement. Chopra is profiled in \"The (In Health [formerly Hippocrates] May-June, 1990). Ayurvedic medicine is ancient East Indian folk medicine inseparable from Hinduism. Like all ancient approaches to treatment, it relies heavily upon psychology (ie, magic) and subjective empiricism. Chopra is aggressive and becoming better known. This article will help readers become familiar with his views and style. Readers of this newsletter should know that Dr. Stephen Barrett has denied making the critical statement about Chopra attributed to him in the article; he only criticizes Ayurvedic philosophy. ARIZONA'S WEIRD MEDICINE The April meeting of the Arizona Board of Medical Examiners focused upon the problem of off-beat medicine. Arizona licenses a wide variety of nonscientific health care providers (eg, acupuncturists, chiropractors, homeopaths, naturopaths), and seems to have more than its fair share of fringe MDs and osteopaths. According to the report, \"Letters of Concern\" (the Board's least-serious form of rebuke) were issued to several physicians. Other MDs were censured for promoting dubious remedies for hemorrhoids and smoking cessation. Still others were cited for malpractice abuses unrelated to quackery. (The Arizona Republic, 4/8/90.) COULD NATUROPATHY EVER MEET ACCEPTABLE STANDARDS? NCAHF is in contact with naturopaths who are leaders in a reform movement. They understand that NCAHF's objection to the recognition of naturopathy is based upon its traditional antiscience orientation. Reformers say that they hope to remove this objection and make naturopathy into an acceptable health care system. Their view of an ideal naturopathic physician (ND) is a practitioner sufficiently trained in diagnosis and screening to serve as a primary entry health care provider practicing general medicine with an emphasis upon teaching healthful lifestyles, managing minor illnesses, natural childbirth, personal counseling, and so forth. Rather than automatically opposing drugs and surgery, they say, naturopathy would simply have a different emphasis. NDs would teach appropriate lifestyle changes that are safe and effective alternatives to drugs. For instance, weight-loss and exercise would be used as an alternative to medication for high blood pressure. If it were found not to be working for an individual patient, he or she would be referred to a regular physician. ND's believe that there is a selective patient population of people willing to make the extra effort required who would utilize naturopathic services. ND training would emphasize patient screening and practitioners would work in cooperation with MDs to whom more serious problems would be referred. Counter to their tradition as \"drugless practitioners,\" reformers say that the idealized ND might even prescribe some medications. NDs say that they prefer to use herbal remedies, but acknowledge that these would have to meet scientific standards of safety and effectiveness. NDs would apply contemporary medical standards to validate their practices and would open themselves to peer review by MDs. NDs would rely upon the standard scientific medical literature for its knowledge base. NDs would abandon homeopathy, iridology, reflexology, and other sectarian or pseudomedical practices. Recognizing the propensity for naturopathy to attract sociopaths, the profession would work to set a higher standard for self-discipline than is presently done with conventional medicine. ND reformers see the present dearth of family practitioners, its appeal to a growing health promotion-minded public willing to work at lifestyle changes, the high cost of high tech health care, and the high cost of medical education as favorable to their marketing strategy. Reformed NDs would encourage immunization, pasteurization, fluoridation, and other proven public health measures. What the reformers have in mind sounds something like nurse practitioners, midwifery, barefoot doctor, and physician assistants, all rolled into a single role. This vision presents naturopathy, not as an \"alternative\" form of health care, but as filling a gap that has been left by the evolution of highly specialized, high-tech medicine. It would provide a low cost, low-technology brand of health care. Is this a pipe-dream or could such a profession emerge from the ranks of present-day naturopathy with its unorthodox traditions? If so, could and would AMA-approved medical schools also offer such a program? Several reform-minded NDs say that it can be done. NCAHF's President has advised these reformers to demonstrate by developing a model program in one or more of the states that presently license NDs and approve Naturopathic Medical Education. It may take a generation to accomplish, but once shown to be a responsible profession working within mainstream health care, naturopathy would have arrived and would grow rapidly. NCAHF has told ND reformers that just as it has done in the case of affiliating with a chiropractic reform organization, it would be willing to help build a bridge for NDs to enter mainstream health care if they approached their practices objectively and were open to careful scrutiny from the consumer protection perspective. As we have suggested to chiropractic reformers, reformer ND's may find it advantageous to change the name of their profession to make it easier to purge itself of incorrigible quackery. NCAHF would be interested in reader's comments as the dialogue continues. NCAHF ATTORNEY FILES LETTERS OF WARNING Michael Botts has recently sent two letters of warning notifying agencies that actions they were about to undertake put the public at risk of serious injury and that ignorance of that fact could not be used as an excuse because they have been notified of the potential dangers of their actions. On May 17 Botts wrote to Oregon Attorney General David Frohnmayer regarding a Rule pending before the Naturopathic Formulary Council (NFC) of the Oregon Naturopathic Board. The Rule would permit naturopaths to prescribe 104 potentially dangerous or poisonous drugs. Included, for instance, was digitalis which can cause cardiac toxicity, heart attacks and deaths. Botts notified the AG that \"injury to the public from naturopaths prescribing under this Rule is not only probable, it is imminent.\" He strongly advised that the AG \"take whatever steps are necessary to see that the public health is not endangered in this manner.\" Botts served notice that if the Rule is enacted and people are injured that he intends to publicize that prior notice had been given of expected dangers from the Rule. For your information, the NFC was formed by an act of the Oregon Legislature in an apparent attempt to satisfy naturopaths who have been clamoring to become something other than \"drugless practitioners.\" The NFC has been constituted in such a way that pro-naturopathic interests outnumber qualified pharmacologists likely to descent 3 to 2. From what NCAHF has learned the NFC appears to represent the worst kind of politicizing of a serious health care issue. The Oregon Board of Naturopathic Examiners objected to the list because it was too restrictive, but agreed to adopt it under strong protest rather than go to court. The naturopathic patient medication time-bomb is ticking in Oregon! On June 6, Botts sent a letter of warning to the Governor of Alaska asking that he veto Alaska House Bill 146 because of Section 22 which states: \"...the board may not base a finding of professional incompetence solely on the basis that a licensee's practice is unconventional or experimental in the absence of demonstrable physical harm to a patient;\" (In plain language, the board cannot lock the barn unless a horse has been stolen!) Botts clearly pointed out that this law put Alaska's citizens in very real danger because the only time the State could act is \"after someone is hurt or killed.\" Botts noted his own past experience as a former Iowa Assistant Attorney General citing the reality that people are regularly injured by quackery. He made it clear that he intended to publicize his letter in the event that the law was passed and someone was injured by a (deviant) Alaska practitioner. Copies of either of these letters are available upon request. Send $1 and a SSAE. PROMOTERS MOAN OVER OTA DRAFT REPORT The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), the agency which does research and investigation on matters involving science and technology for the U.S. Congress, initiated a study of unconventional cancer treatments in January, 1987. The study was requested by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce which oversees a wide range of health issues. The Committee had been heavily lobbied by proponents of so-called \"Immuno-Augmentative Therapy\" (IAT), a dubious cancer remedy being sold in the Bahamas by a maverick zoologist Lawrence Burton, PhD. Like laetrile promoters in the 1970's, the strategy involved picketing congressmen by allegedly cured cancer patients (many of whom are now dead), and people who operate the referral agencies posing as consumer advocates. NCAHF has followed this study carefully, but limited its comments to a single item in the May-June, 1987 issue of this newsletter. We predicted at that time that OTA would \"..simply go over the ground covered by all of the rest of us who study cancer quackery. Following a negative report, the quacks will predictably yell 'foul' and resurrect their standby arguments about conspiracies, cover-ups, inside fixes, and so forth.\" This statement sounds like a perfect prophecy in light of what has transpired. On March 9 the OTA held a public meeting at which many of the promoters of cancer quackery appeared to vent their anger over the report. The usual players were present to present the familiar distortions of reality that has become their creed. Promoters are pushing for a double standard. They want to be able to sell cancer remedies on the basis of the marketplace demand they can create through publicity and advertising employing testimonials and unsubstantiated claims. The essence of the OTA's review of the unconventional remedies and arguments of proponents can be summed up by linking several outstanding sentences in the draft report: \"One system of medicine is formally recognized in the United States-scientific medicine, dominated by medical doctors. The safety and efficacy requirements of the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act for new drugs and medical devices codify scientific medicine as the national standard\" (1-14). \". . .'unconventional cancer treatments'. . . are defined not by what they are, but what they are not: part of mainstream, orthodox medicine\" (1-25). \"Valid methods for determining the efficacy and safety of unconventional cancer treatments are the same as those that are valid for evaluating conventional treatments. There is no 'alternative evaluation' methodology that can give valid answers. . .\" (1-43). No matter how much the promoters of unconventional therapies moan, there is no denying these facts. The obvious financial self-interest of those selling unconventional cancer remedies negates their arguments charging self-interest on the part of the establishment. What the promoters obviously seek is to escape the accountability that goes with offering responsible medical care. [Citations used above are technically not quotable because they are taken from the unofficial, preliminary draft. They are presented to show what it is that promoters are complaining about.] The quackery-related death of a 17-month-old girl has sent shock waves across Canada. No one aspect of the story is unusual. The scenario is a classic combination of cultural vulnerability, modern urban mythology and quackery. The Victim Dead from malnutrition and pneumonia is Lorie Atikian. Eight months before her death on September 25, 1987, Lorie was a perfectly healthy baby. When she died she was nearly bald, covered with deep red rashes, and so emaciated that the paramedics thought they were being tricked by being given a doll to treat. The Parents Lorie's parents Sonia, 38, and Khochadour, 54, are emigres from Lebanon and Syria. In addition to Lorie, the couple has two teenaged children. Like many people these days the Atikian's were concerned about modern food additives, pesticide residues, and drugs. Their cultural background may have made them a bit more vulnerable, but like most people they held positive attitudes toward \"natural\" food and medicine. Sonia became enamored with Gerhard Hanswille, an \"herbologist.\" The \"Herbologist\" Gerhard Hanswille, 55, says that he learned herbology in Germany through self-study and books (Germany has a tradition of folk medicine that includes a great deal of Medieval herbalism). In 1972, Hanswille obtained a mail order doctoral degree in naturopathy from \"Bernadean University\" (BU) located at that time in Las Vegas, Nevada. BU, which was never approved or accredited to offer any courses, was closed down by the Nevada Commission on Postsecondary Education in 1976. It then moved to California where it operated for several years before eventually becoming \"authorized\" under the State's liberal rules (Aronson, 1983). California has tried to close BU but has been blocked by its claim to being a religious school of the Church of Universology (Emshwiller, 1987). Hanswille owns two \"House of Herbs\" stores, writes and gives seminars at which he expounds his theories, which include making wax and clay effigies sealed with drops of blood and sperm (notions founded in Monismand Vitalism which are the basis of most primitive folk medicine). Hanswille's book describes how to heal diabetes, epilepsy, TB, tumors and paralysis by \"touchless massage.\" Hanswille likens the technique to dowsing for water, something that \"not everyone can do.\" Sonia paid $450 to take Hanswille's course. The Promise Hanswille's compelling vision of natural health made a convert of Sonia. When she became pregnant with Lorie in 1985 Hanswille convinced her to remain \"pure\" for the sake of the child. She testified that Hanswille promised to make Lorie a super baby. \"That baby is going to be very different. Its going to develop without chemicals. Its going to be strong and pure...it going to be very special.\" Hanswille convinced Sonia that vaccinations would \"poison\" her child, and that ultrasound examination would damage an unborn baby's brain. He had Sonia tell her pediatrician that she would not be bringing Lorie in any more because the family was moving to California. Hanswille was described as \". . .like a doctor. . .surrounded by medicine and books. . . sure of what he was saying. He always had an answer.\" The Regimen Hanswille advocated an organic, vegetarian diet. He sold the Atikians a special juicer for $400 alleging that their own juicer \"burned the nutrition\" out of fruits. Among the special products the Atikians purchased from Hanswille were a bottle of baby oil that cost $16, a bar of soap costing $7.40, and a 3 kg box of laundry detergent that cost $35.99. When Lorie became ill she was treated with royal jelly, \"cell salts\" (homeopathy), and an herbal concoction brewed by Hanswille. He also treated Lorie with an electromagnetic \"vitalizing\" machine that \"stimulates the blood\" and has attachments such as an electrified comb that \"livens up the hair.\" Sonia Atikian testified that they became very concerned about Lorie's condition but that Hanswille assured them that it was normal for clumps of her baby's hair to fall out and not to worry if Lorie didn't gain weight. Hanswille told Sonia that taking Lorie to a hospital would be like \"holding a loaded gun to Lorie's head and pulling the trigger.\" The Legal Charges The Atikians were charged with failing to provide the necessities of life for their baby daughter (child neglect). Up until now Hanswille has not been charged with anything. He has angrily complained that he feels like \"the accused\" but denies that he did anything wrong. He says that he \"cannot tell people what to do,\" that it is up to the parents to make decisions for their children. The judge instructed the jury that it was all right for them to \"vent your spleen\" over the activities of Hanswille \"and his ilk,\" but neither he nor herbalism were on trial in the death of little Lorie. The Verdict On June 12 the Atikians were found guilty of child neglect. Sentencing is scheduled for July 6. How Unusual Is This Case? The sad story of the death of little Lorie Atikian received national coverage in Canada by the Toronto Star (5/10-6/13) and The Globe and Mail. It is the kind of story that elicits harsh blame of the parents for their gullibility. \"How could they have been so foolish?\" is the usual response. The reality is that most of the public is sympathetic to the underlying assumptions that condemn modern food, commercial agriculture and extol \"natural\" medicine. The herbal industry is trying to distance itself from Hanswille by saying that the case is \"not typical.\" However, we believe that what Hanswille told the Atikians is not only widely believed by health food and natural (herbal) medicine ilk; it largely represents the philosophy that is used to justify the existence of \"alternative\" medicine and herbalism. The faith the Atikians placed in Hanswille seems cult-like, but how different is it than the confidence a patient must put in a surgeon, anesthesiologist, radiologist, or physician who hold lives in their hands? Murder, By Words Alone? In 1962, a California chiropractor was convicted of second-degree murder by words alone in the death of 11-year-old cancer patient, Linda Epping. To get a conviction, the prosecutor had to prove that \"his fraudulent representations ... caused Linda to die when she died\" (Miner, 1964). We do not know enough about Ontario law to know if what Hanswille did constituted the unlawful practice of medicine, and if so, the resultant death of Lorie Atikian makes such a felony. We do know that Lorie's death is even more tragic than Linda Epping's because Linda had a form of cancer that is usually fatal while Lorie was a healthy baby with a normal future. People who presume to give health advice that can make the difference between life and death must be regulated by the government and held accountable for their misdeeds. Consumer protection law holds that practicing medicine is a privilege, not a right. Like driving a car or flying an airplane, only those who are qualified are granted such privilege by the state. It is clear that the state has a compelling responsibility to protect vulnerable people\u2014and their children\u2014from the glib purveyors of pseudomedicine. It matters not that such practitioners are sincere in their beliefs. Experience teaches that, when it comes to quackery, zealotry can be more dangerous than fraud.

The article dispels the illusion that the OAM was founded because medical scientists saw great value in \"alternative\" medicine. In truth it was the influence of quacks on gullible politicians who then used their political power to impose the OAM on NIH. The result has been the biggest public relations victory for quackery in history (which the article quotes NCAHF president as stating). The article also establishes the fact that individuals are using their association with OAM to sell people on the value of the questionable methods they promote. This article is must reading-especially for journalists who are doing stories on the OAM. NCAHF has been collecting media reports on the OAM and it is abundantly clear that the media has missed the real story. Worse, it has become the unwitting accomplice of quackophiles who are using NIH's prestige to advance their causes. CAT'S CLAW CANCER REMEDY Cat's claw cancer herbal Peruvian folk remedy is being touted as a cancer medicine in the USA. Ads have been run on Spanish-speaking radio stations. The remedy involves Una de Gato-Cat's Claw in English. Cat's Claw can involve either of two herbs whose scientific names are Uncaria tomentosa and Uncaria guianensis. Cat's Claw is being quacked as \"a wondrous herb from the Peruvian rain forest\" thus capitalizing upon the current fascination with rain forest explorations. Reports in the fringe literature are typical. They talk about how the herb is used to treat cancer by people in Peru (none of whom seem to be qualified to judge its worth), and quickly and without warning shift to other uses and/or information that have more credibility. According to a scientific report in the Journal of Natural Products (1991;54:453-9) researchers have isolated six new quinovic acid glycosides from Cat's Claw samples. Oral doses inhibited edema (swelling) but showed no significant anti-inflammatory action on experimentally induced edema in a rat's paw. Because of anecdotal reports of Cat's Claw having been used as a folk remedy for cancer, samples have been submitted to the National Cancer Institute for testing. THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF QUACKERY IS SCARY NCAHF believes that quackery can be cost-effective: (1) if it is cheaper, (e.g., vitamins and herbs instead of prescription drugs); and, (2) because patients will die sooner than they would with standard care. Cost Health care has become outrageously expensive. Overloads of paperwork, the for-profit legal profession using its creativity to find ways to milk the medical system, a politically-sustained welfare bottomless pit, and more have driven costs to beyond reason. By comparison, most quack (i.e., alternative medicine) is cheap. Some insurance companies are already testing the financial viability of writing policies for \"alternative\" medicine. Effectiveness It is the lack of effectiveness of quack remedies that makes them financially appealing. Shortening the time of care saves money. Quacks substitute patient satisfaction for effectiveness. This is attained by communication skills (i.e., simple answers), compassion (friendliness and expressions of concern), providing hope (never say \"die\"-literally!), and administering mood-altering substances and/or procedures (i.e., Dr. Feelgood techniques). Dr. Feelgood techniques include: (1) herbal \"energizers\" (e.g., Ma Huang, caffeine- containing substances, coffee enemas, or ginseng); (2) \"bodywork\" (e.g., massage, manipulation, laying on hands) which relaxes people and increases their suggestibility thus enhancing the placebo effect; (3) colonic irrigations, which give people a jolt, and are erotic experiences for some (if you don't believe this, you should see the pro-colonic materials in NCAHF's files); what appears to be a \"natural\" remedy can be adulterated with prescription drugs that produce real effects. Socially-acceptable euthanasia? Quackery offers another benefit \u2014 it is socially-acceptable euthanasia. Jack Kevorkian has made physician-assisted suicide a matter of national debate. Cases such as those of Nancy Cruzan, Baby Jane Doe, and Baby K have stymied medical ethicists and cost the nation millions in resources. In contrast, overwhelming apathy is seen when someone opts for quack medicine. Why is there such a difference between our views of withholding life-support versus substituting quackery for life-prolonging standard care? Using quackery creates the illusion of having treatment rather than giving in to fate. In addition, we seem to be culturally conditioned to quackery-use as an acceptable expression of individual autonomy, but not so with euthanasia. If politicians and health business profiteers take notice, we're in real trouble. BOOK ON CRITICAL THINKING How To Think About Weird Things: Critical Thinking For A New Age, by Schick and Vaugh (Mayfield, 1995) in my view, does what no other book on critical thinking has done; it delivers! Many lament over the great need for the teaching of critical thinking. As a teacher, I have followed this concept for years, reading everything I could find on the topic, and attending seminars. Interestingly, no one has ever been certain about how to go about teaching critical thinking. Many resort to coursework in logic, but this doesn't seem to work for anyone but those who already think logically! The idea has been advanced that the best defense against bad ideas is a wide base of knowledge that enables one to have many touch points with reality. Critics say that people are so highly specialized that they can only recognize error within their own very narrow scopes. At the same time they have been taught to be open-minded. The method I have preferred is to recapitulate the order of events historically that brought humankind from primitive, prescientific (magical) thinking, through early attempts at science, and noting landmark improvements on the scientific method. Schick and Vaughn approach the problem by raising key issues, asking the basic questions, providing insightful information on the landmark cases that have driven popular beliefs, and drawing principles that can be used in making judgments in the future. The factor that wins the point time after time is that they provide the information that discredits the anecdotal cases that have given credence to new age beliefs. As a result, readers are not only armed with guiding principles on how to think about weird things, they can explain how weird things appeared believable in the first place. I rate this book as one of the best I have ever seen. It should be required reading for every student. \u2014 William Jarvis SPORTS PERFORMANCE AID MET-RX QUESTIONED MET-Rx, a sports performance aid, claims to contain a special, superior \"European-produced protein.\" The company has sold over $60 million worth thus far. Because of the number of high profile professional athletes and teams which are touting the product, San Francisco Examiner medical writer Lisa Krieger took a careful look. She reported (9/15/95) that MET-Rx is just another high-priced item that capitalizes upon athletes' wishful thinking. David Lightsey, Coordinator of NCAHF's Ergogenic Aids Task Force, says that there is no magic in MET-Rx and that the money spent on the product would be more wisely used to buy food. The company's founder, A. Scott Connelly, MD (anesthesiologist) acknowledges that there are no conclusive studies, but says that studies will eventually prove the superiority of his product. In the meantime, he is relying upon the testimonials of happy celebrities. ALABAMA SAYS TO DIPLOMA MILL: NOT IN OUR BACK YARD! Lloyd Clayton of Birmingham, Alabama operates a number of diploma mills. (An organization that awards degrees without requiring its students to meet educational standards for such degrees established and traditionally followed by reputable institutions. [Pollution in Higher Education; Efforts of the US Dept. of Education in relation to degree mills, USOE, 3/74.]) Included are the Clayton School of Natural Healing, Chadwick University, and the American Holistic College of Nutrition. (Clayton also sells \"Dr. Clayton's herbals and homeopathics.\") Although the Clayton \"schools\" operate in Alabama, they are not licensed there. Alabama's Department of Education attempted to close Clayton down in 1981, but Clayton fought it legally. The State Attorney General opined that the \"schools\" would not be required to be licensed if they offered no programs to Alabama citizens. [Joe Miller, Private School Licensure Section, Alabama Dept of Education, letter 9/18/95] Comment: The AG's action gave sanctuary to a socially despicable operation. This apparently does not please the Dept of Education, but its hands are tied. Mr. Miller is to be thanked for being forthright in his response to our questioning on the status of the Clayton \"schools.\" (Clayton \"schools\" are \"accredited\" only by an accreditation mill!) DEEPAK CHOPRA Deepak Chopra, MD has become so popular that the Los Angeles Public Television station KCET used him for its 1995 fund-raising campaign. Chopra lectured on his metaphysical views and was interviewed and praised by the moderator as the phones rang and the pledges poured in. The scene resembled religious TV shows that preach and raise money. Those who have followed Chopra from his days promoting the Maharishi, through his success as a writer of wishful thinking books and association with the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine, to his rise and fall at Sharp Hospital in southern California will find Elise Pettus's article in New York magazine (8/14/95) a fact-filled journey from his birth to his future plans as a guru. This is a four-star article for readers who want to collect profiles of the leading personalities in alternative medicine. QUACKED CONSUMER REPORTER STRIKES BACK Ellen Burstein was a TV investigative reporter for 13 years who was struck with multiple sclerosis. In 1991 she read a glowing front page New York magazine report about Dr. Irving Dardik and his Superesonant Wavenergy (SRWE) program. Dardik's credentials included having been chairman of the U.S. Olympic Committee's Sports Medicine Council. Dardik told her that his SRWE program was aimed at correcting imbalances in the immune system through a stress-recovery regimen and that in time her MS would disappear. He demanded $100,000 up front for treatment. In time, Burstein came to realize that Dardik's program was a fraud, and she didn't take it lying down. Drawing upon her experience, Burstein pursued the matter. [This resulted in the New York State licensing board lifting Dardik's medical license](http://www.quackwatch.com/11Ind/Dardik/index.html). She has also filed common fraud charges. Burstein told her story in TV Guide (10/15/94). The concise and substantive article is one of the best we've seen. Ironically, it is an instance where a story in a prominent publication duped a media professional into becoming a victim of quackery, and how that victim used her media-learned skills to bring her assailant to justice. At NCAHF we see cases in which the media was the source which both made the victim aware, and instilled the confidence necessary for the victim to pursue, some form of quackery. Burstein's case can be used as a model to illustrate the problem our society faces due to the interaction of a media philosophy that denies social responsibility for promoting quackery and the current buccaneer free-enterprize political philosophy. GANDHI DID NOT ENDORSE AYURVEDIC URINE DRINKING The August 21 Newsweek carried an item alleging that the ayurvedic practice of drinking one's own urine is gaining in popularity. Therapeutic applications are dubbed \"urotherapy\" and \"uropathy.\" The article stated that Gandhi followed the practice-the implication being that if a great man like him would drink his own urine, it may not be as crazy and disgusting as it seems. Now comes a letter from Arun Gandhi of the Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence saying that urine drinking was not a therapy he believed in or advocated. [Newsweek 9/18/95:25] ALGAE PEDDLERS NUMBERS GROWING In August, 3,500 distributors of Cell Tech's blue-green algae products gathered in Klamath Falls, Oregon. According to the report, the number of distributors has grown from 26,000 to 185,000 in the past two years [The Oregonian, 8/4/95]. Cell Tech is the successor of KC Laboratories that was shut down by the FDA in 1986. We have been unable to distinguish between the claims and activities of Cell Tech and those that caused KC's demise. The fact that blue-green is also the color of money seems to be a significant factor. CASE IS DROPPED AGAINST MAVERICK MD The Justice Department decided not to file charges against Jonathan Wright, MD, the Kent, Washington physician whose office was raided by the FDA in 1992. Wright, who is the former president of the American Quack Association and current president of the National Health Federation, was accused of smuggling unapproved drugs, among other things (for details see \"Health foods industry backs 'persecuted' doctor,\" Priorities, Winter, 1993). Alexander Schauss, who leads the health food industry lobbying group Citizens For Health (CFH) rallied its activists to clamor on Wright's behalf. CFH portrayed the FDA raid as an abuse of federal power (a la, Waco & Ruby Ridge). I t is not known whether the bombing of the Federal Building at Oklahoma City has caused the Justice Department to back away from noisy radicals, or if politicians have used their influence (Orrin Hatch is head of the Senate Judiciary Committee) to \"call off the dogs.\" At any rate, CFH's Schauss is calling the decision \"a great day for alternative medicine.\" [Seattle Times wire story in Kansas City Star, 9/26/95] DENTAL MAVERICK CHARGED The Colorado Attorney General has charged Colorado Springs dentist Hal Huggins with prescribing drugs having nothing to do with dentistry (eg, insulin), removing the dental amalgams from patients with the promise that it would solve incurable diseases, and employing oddball methods (e.g., devices, equipment without clinical justification, and strange procedures such as vitamin C purges) in his practice. Huggins has developed a national following of maverick dentists throug h his books and continuing dental education courses. Huggins claims that he is being persecuted by the dental profession for exposing the dangers of mercury fillings. Huggins justifies medical tests and procedures on his claim that dental mercury causes medical problems. This report says that Huggins' license to practice dentistry is in jeopardy. [Denver Post, 8/30/95] CANCER QUACK GETS 5 YEARS On June 20, Michael Kent Bilbrey, 44, of Chandler, AZ was sentenced to 5 years in prison and ordered to pay $39,300 in restitution for selling a quack cure that was nothing more than a concoction of cranberry juice, saline solution and household bleach. Bilbrey pleaded guilty in March to a charge of theft, admitting that he promoted his potion as a cure for cancer and AIDS with no scientific justification. DRUG CHAINS SUED FOR HOMEOPATHY CLAIMS A California-based public interest attorney, Donald Driscoll, has filed lawsuits in that state against major drug chains, including Payless, Long's, and Walgreens, charging that package inserts indicating specific uses for homeopathic remedies constitute false advertising. Driscoll hopes to accomplish what the FDA failed to do when drug companies starting marketing homeopathic products in the mid-1980s, which is to require such medicines to comply with the 1962 Amendment to the federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act that requires drugs to be proved effective prior to marketing. Driscoll's lawsuits are mentioned in a story covering homeopathy that appeared in Time magazine on 9/25/95 (pp.47-8). Comment: Homeopathy spokesman Jay Borneman states that Driscoll's lawsuits \"are another attempt by the National Council Against Health Fraud to attack homeopathy\" [Resonance, Sept-Oct, 1995, p.25]. As pleased as we are with these lawsuits, NCAHF had nothing to do with Driscoll's action. Dr. Barrett provided information after Driscoll contacted him and told him of his intent to file the lawsuits. Of course, NCAHF will provide whatever help it can in these cases. A question being raised by Borneman is whether legal action filed in a California County Court can restrict the sale of products marketed in compliance with current federal policy. NCAHF contends that current FDA policy violates the law the agency is supposed to uphold. # COLLOIDAL SILVER Colloidal silver is being touted as a \"natural universal antibiotic.\" It is also said to (guess what) \"enhance the immune system\" (which seems to have become the universal claim for contemporary quackery!). Promoters claim colloidal silver is useful for HIV/AIDS, cancer, herpes, candidasis, stap h & strep infections, shingles, TB, diabetes, as an antiparasitic medication, and more. The FDA is not aware of any substantial evidence which demonstrates that colloidal silver solution is useful to prevent or treat any serious condition, or that it is safe. The substance has not been proved safe or effective. FDA warns that the indiscriminate use of colloidal silver solutions can result in argyria which includes a permanent ashen-grey discoloration of the skin. [Unproven product warning, Univ of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension News Office, Madison 11/11/94] # NEW BOOK REVEALS DANGERS OF CHIROPRACTIC Chiropractic: The Victim's Perspective is a detailed, penetrating 260-page report that exposes the dangers of chiropractic health care. The author, George Magner, who was permanently injured by chiropractic treatment, spent several years collecting information on others who suffered serious trauma at the hands of chiropractors. His manuscript was edited by Stephen Barrett, MD, who provided additional data. The book covers chiropractic's history and current status. Included are: \"subluxation theory,\" chiropractic education and licensure, questionable marketing dubious diagnostics and therapeutics, nutrition-related nonsense, \"chiropractic pediatrics,\" insurance abuses, the AMA antitrust lawsuit, deceptions behind recent headlines, research considerations. significant risks, the need for informed consent, \"freedom of choice\" issues, and the urgent need for reform.

Jarvis, Ph.D. Misdefinitions A review of studies of physicians' interest in \"alternative\" and/or \"complementary\" medicine reveals that most writers don't understand their topic. There is no consistent definition of these terms and writers do not even apply simple dictionary meanings. For instance, an article in Medical Economics (9/11/95) entitled \"Alternative medicine comes to the OR\" describes a cardiac surgeon (Mehmet Oz) who used qigong (a Chinese relaxation technique) on surgical patients. Qigong is considered legitimate as a relaxation technique, but so-called \"qigong masters\" who purport to heal by paranormal means are considered charlatans even in China. (Honglin. \"Introduction to the theory and method of Chinese qigong and pseudo-qigong,\" Rocky Mt Skeptic, Nov-Dec '92). The writer used the wrong word. Webster's Dictionary defines alternative as \"a proposition or situation offering a choice between two or more things only one of which may be chosen\" (emphasis added). Unproven alternatives that replace proven medicine are unacceptable. Oz was using qi gong as \"complementary\" medicine. Complementary meaning: 1: serving to fill out or complete; 2: mutually supplying each other's lack. Complementary is a standard medical term. Oz used qi gong to relax presurgical patients, which is an appropriate application of the art of medicine. Apples and lemons lumped together Too many fail to separate potentially useful alternative methods (e.g., suggestive therapies, psychological aids, relaxation techniques) from pure quackery (e.g., AIDS and cancer cures). Lumping all alternative practices together allows quackery to benefit from the credibility of those with some usefulness. Time magazine this did in its 1991 cover story touting alternative medicine. Its poll showed that most people were using chiropractors and acupuncturists, but the article pictured people being treated with crystal healing and exotic ayurvedic sesame oil drips that no one had reported. A survey of Quebec general practice and family physicians asked only about acupuncture, chiropractic and hypnosis. Some have listed \"counseling and psychotherapy\" presumably done by clinical psychologists who are referred to as \"nonmedical providers.\" Other procedures that have been part of standard medicine for years that have been listed include hypnosis, biofeedback, relaxation techniques, and acupuncture-yes, acupuncture! Acupuncture has been used in American medicine for decades. Granted, its effects may be largely placebo, but its mechanisms of endorphin release, suggestion therapy, counter-irritation, and its usefulness as a psychological aid have enabled it to survive clinically. Some include \"diet and exercise\" as \"alternative,\" which is crazy. Preventive medicine has been promoting these for years. Even Dr. Dean Ornish's program has been dubbed \"alternative\" despite the fact that he has provided evidence of its value which is widely accepted as valid. Much tolerance toward alternative medicine is due to ignorance. I had bachelor's and master's degrees in health education from two major universities and had never heard the word \"chiropractic.\" I learned of it because of an interest in manipulative therapy in the prevention and care of athletic injuries. In the 1960s, a number of negative articles on chiropractic appeared in the literature. To get chiropractic's side of the story, I began reading their publications. It was reading what DCs said about themselves that alarmed me and made me realize that chiropractic is a dangerous health care cult. This led to the hypothesis that the more a health educator knew about chiropractic, the less he/she would like it. This was the focus of my doctoral dissertation. I provided accurate, unbiased information on the history, theory, beliefs and practices of chiropractors through a programmed instruction course. The course was developed with the aid of two chiropractic groups (straights & mixers; n=19), and one medical groups (n=3). All agreed that the information provided accurately portrayed the chiropractic controversy. My hypothesis included another well-established reality, that knowledge was but one factor influencing attitudes, and that it was not the primary factor. This was proved by the fact that at the end of the course, the scores on the knowledge level of the test group equaled those of chiropractic students in training, but their attitudes were highly negative, while the chiropractic students' attitudes were highly positive. I believe that current studies of the attitudes of medical doctors toward alternative medicine reflect the same reality that led me to conduct my study. I contend that this would hold true for most of what currently is calling itself alternative medicine. Studies of physicians' attitudes toward nonstandard medicine consistently find a combination of interest in these topics coupled with ignorance about them. Unless they are predisposed to believing in an ideology that is in conflict with scientific thinking, the more physicians learn about these procedures, the more negative their attitudes become toward them.

The background of this case goes back to CBCE's attempt to have colonics included in chiropractors' scope of practice (BMQA v. Luly and CBCE, 1984).

Volume 12, Issue #3 CALIFORNIA CHIROPRACTIC BOARD'S ATTEMPT TO EXPAND SCOPE OF PRACTICE THWARTED The Sacramento County Superior Court has ruled against the California Board of Chiropractic Examiners (CBCE) in a lawsuit brought by the California Medical Association and a number of physicians with the state's medical and physical therapy licensing boards as interveners. The background of this case goes back to CBCE's attempt to have colonics included in chiropractors' scope of practice (BMQA v. Luly and CBCE, 1984). The California Department of Justice ordered DCs to stop doing colonics on the basis that such constituted medical practice. CBCE joined Luly in challenging the ruling and lost. CBCE then attempted to include colonics-and some other dubious practices-within the chiropractic scope of practice by redefining chiropractic practice. Handicapping CBCE is the fact that the 1922 chiropractic practice act was established by a voter referendum which can only be changed by another referendum. Several landmark decisions, the most important of which is Crees v. BMQA (1963), have held that DC scope of practice can only be revised within the confines of what chiropractic was believed to be in 1922. The Sacramento court has made a summary judgment upholding both the Crees and Luly decisions further setting the cement around greatly limiting DC's scope of practice in California. Comment: California has more DCs (8500+, 20% of the world's total), and chiropractic colleges (5 of 16 in the USA) than any other political region; plus, Los Angeles College of Chiropractic seems to be the most progressive in turning chiropractic into a respectable profession; therefore, events in California are bound to have an important influence on DCs everywhere. We wonder if the state's rigid practice act might eventually force progressive DCs to form a new profession. OREGON TAKES LICENSE OF HOLISTIC PHYSICIAN On March 22, the Oregon Court of Appeals upheld the license revocation of Lynn Anderson, MD (Washington Medical School, St. Louis, 1973) who formerly practiced in Medford, Oregon. The medical board issued the revocation after Anderson refused to submit to a board interview in 1986 that was part of an investigation into complaints by former patients. Anderson described herself as a \"holistic\" physician. She says that her refusal to cooperate with the board was based upon her belief that it would be biased against her as a holistic practitioner. She says that members of the board are physicians schooled in mainstream medicine and refuse to be educated in what holistic medicine is all about. Anderson now resides in Hawaii where she says that she is doing \"research and writing.\" She says that she plans to appeal the decision. (The Mail Tribune (Medford, OR), 3/23/89.) GILDA RADNER The recent death Radner represents a set-back for the \"think-yourself-well\" movement in cancer therapy. Ms. Radner has received widespread publicity as a celebrity spokesperson who was alleged to have \"beat ovarian cancer with the help of a psychological regimen outlined by a Northern California wellness clinic\" (Florida Magazine, 4/16/89). Radner was featured on the cover of Life magazine touting the mind over matter approach to cancer therapy. Although upbeat psychological programs theoretically might help people overcome depression and despair, the false hope of these unproven methods has great potential for abuse, and the popularity of such programs is being capitalized upon by quackery. It is very doubtful if the media will publicize Radner's failure to anywhere near the degree it did her alleged success. This is a lesson in how the media helps advance dubious cancer treatments. SUPPLEMENT USE BY HEALTHY ELDERLYDietary supplements apparently provide some benefit and some risk to the healthy elderly population. Use of supplements markedly decreased the proportion of subjects with inadequate nutrient intakes using a 2/3s of RDA criterion for vitamins B6, B12, D, folic acid and calcium. However, potentially excessive levels of thiamine, vitamins A and E were observed.(Hartz et al. J American College of Nutrition, 7:119-128, 1988). NORTH CAROLINA BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS CONDEMNS CHELATION THERAPY The North Carolina Board of Medical examiners has resolved that \"chelation therapy is of no proven benefit in the treatment of atherosclerotic disease and should not be used for this purpose until its clinical efficacy is established by formal, controlled , clinical trials or by some objective evidence of its benefit. Moreover, treatment with chelating agents, including EDTA, has some associated toxicity and should not be considered a completely benign procedure.\" (From the Board's 12/88 newsletter.) CLAUDE PEPPER (1900 - 1989) NCAHF wishes to pay tribute to Congressman Claude Pepper who died on May 30. Mr. Pepper was an exemplary figure who fought to improve the lot of common people. His 1984 anti-quackery hearings established the problem as a national issue and set the pace for reform. NCAHF was pleased to see Pepper receive a quackbusters T-shirt for his 85th birthday at the 1985 National Health Fraud Conference. NCAHF's national media awards given for the best anti-quackery coverage are named for Mr. Pepper. Hopefully, some of today's legislators will catch the vision of public service Mr. Pepper represented and follow in his footsteps. PHARMACISTS ADMONISHED TO AVOID NUTRITIONAL QUACKERY Wayne Bidlack, PhD and Mark Meslin, MS, RD, have co-authored \"Nutritional quackery: selling health misinformation\" (Calif Pharmacist, 36:34-43, Feb, 1989) which admonishes pharmacists to provide accurate health advice as a duty to their customers and their profession. Their exceptionally well-done article describes nutritional quackery's methodology and provides information on many dubious products. Among the methods used to promote nutritional quackery are: exaggerated claims for special foods or products; distortion by omission; distortion from a scientific fact; false nutritional premise; promotion of unrecognized nutrients as beneficial to good health; promises to prevent or cure diseases; and, promises of an easy solution to a difficult problem. Dubious products covered include: wheatgrass, wheat germ, acid supplements, Vitamin C, pyridoxine, mineral supplements, Vitamin A, and pangamic acid. The authors conclude by telling what can be done to identify and fight nutritional quackery. This is one of the best articles on the topic we have seen for awhile. NCAHF BOARD MEMBER WINS AWARD Victor Herbert, MD, JD, has been awarded the 1989 Dupont Specialty Diagnostics Award for his work in nutrition and metabolism, and for the subsequent significant development of ligand assays for vitamins and hormones. The Clinical Ligand Society particularly recognized Dr. Herbert's development of the first radioassay for the surface cell receptors for B12 binding protein, for a radioassay for vitamin B12, and for the concept of coated charcoal for the separation of free from bound ligand. The award was presented at the society's annual meeting in May. ESSAYS CRITICAL OF NEW AGE Prometheus Books has published Not Necessarily the New Age: Critical Essays (1988), which is 395-pages representing 17 critiques of New Age activities and thought. Jeff Walker reviews the work in The Ontario Skeptic. Readers may want to scrutinize Walker's review before ordering this anthology, and may do so by sending a SSAE to NCAHF and 50 cents in cash or stamps. A portion of Walker's review includes statements attributed to Marc Madoff, editor and publisher of a New York-based holistic magazine. Madoff excoriates his community for flinging itself into a pyramiding scam disguised as a prosperity workshop; \"The holistic community... has never had the guts to police its own, to reject the leeches and New Age scum that have permeated our ranks from day one. As a result, we've taken in and supported some of the lowest dregs that mainstream society has thrown away, and we've gone beyond supporting them; we've made them our leaders. And in doing so we've created a sick community, one that thrives in a fantasy world where the normal laws of logic and reason don't apply...\" Medoff declares that being openminded and nonjudgmental have gone to such extremes that \"what we have here is a social circus; anything goes, and nothing is wrong.\" He admits that the New Age is a sales promotion package and now disassociates his magazine from the concept and much of its content.

Judge Sutter concluded that \"overwhelming evidence... proved... that Alta-Dena's raw milk frequently contains dangerous bacteria which causes serious illness. Pasteurization kills such bacteria. Yet for 35 years, Alta-Dena carried out a false and misleading advertising campaign touting its raw milk now sold under the 'Stueve's Natural' label as 'safe', the 'safest' and superior to pasteurized milk. Alta-Dena's health and nutrition claims have also been misleading and sometimes downright dangerous.\" The Judge's decision would require that all raw milk product cartons carry a clear warning about the dangers of raw milk. The court action came in a suit brought by Consumer's Union and the American Public Health Association. The court order would also require the dairy to pay $100,000 as restitution to a fund to fight consumer health fraud, and civil penalties of $23,000 to the Alameda County District Attorney. [Consumer's Union News, press release dated 4/10/89; contact person: Elizabeth Laporte, 414/391-8100.] CLINICAL ECOLOGY OVERVIEW Stephen Barrett, MD, provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the pseudomedical practices of \"clinical ecology\" and \"candidiasis hypersensitivity\" (\"yeast the March-April, 1989 Nutrition Today. Dr. Barrett summarizes the key points presented in past critiques of these topics, and provides a great deal of new information, some of which is startling. Most amazing is the fact that the American Medical Association and American Academy of Family Physicians grant continuing medical education credit for questionable courses offered by the American Academy of Environmental Medicine, a mutual admiration society for clinical ecologists. Particularly revealing is the information on the political activities of practitioners and patients, and the implications their purported claims have for insurance companies who are pressured to pay for dubious treatments. In 1977, a federal tax court ruled that, Theron Randolph, MD, a leading proponent of clinical ecology, could deduct the extra cost of \"organically grown\" foods as a medical expense! Equally impressive is Dr. Barrett's overview of \"candidiasis hypersensitivity.\" This dubious malady is also linked to AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, \"hypoglycemia\", and alleged dental amalgam (mercury) toxicity. Here again, Barrett summarizes key material from the past and provides new information. Barrett concludes with recommendations to improve consumer protection. These include: (1) scrutiny of practitioners by state licensing boards; (2) FDA action against the illegal marketing of anti-candida products; and, (3) withdrawal of continuing education certification by medical organizations. CLINICAL ECOLOGIST GUILTY IN CHILD'S NEAR-DEATH The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (Canada) Discipline Committee accepted the guilty plea of Dr. Irvine Allen Korman following a near-fatal allergic reaction of a child who he failed to properly assess and wrongly advised. A mother, herself a dentist, brought her two children to Dr. Korman for treatment of allergy problems both have had since birth. The boy had become worse since starting school. The children were tested, the boy more so than the girl, in two ways. First, was the sublingual application of a solution followed by 10-minutes observation for unusual behavior (This sublingual provocative test is condemned by the American Academy of Allergy and immunology.). The second test was \"applied kinesiology\" in which the patient holds a closed glass container of a solution of the substance to be tested in one hand while the examiner tests the strength of the opposite abducted arm (\"muscle-testing\"). The mother did not understand the second test and questioned Dr. Korman about the reliability and predictability of this test for peanut sensitivity. Korman told her that he had absolute confidence in these tests and assured her that it was all right to give the children peanuts. The mother purchased some \"organically-grown\" peanut butter and gave each child a tiny amount on a piece of bread. \"A dramatic scene followed. Both children collapsed. The girl was terribly white-faced, regained consciousness, was given medication, vomited, developed huge hives, but continued to breathe. The boy kept struggling, could not open his eyes, was gasping for breath, was blue and choking. An ambulance took the family to the hospital where the children were given adrenaline and within a few hours were fine again, but naturally somewhat shaken.\" Korman was given a recorded reprimand, had his license suspended for 60 days, with an additional 12-months suspension if he failed to complete the McMaster Physician Review Program with special attention to the areas of immunology, allergy and nutrition; plus, any remedial programs that may be recommended under the Physician's Enhancement Program. Further, Korman had to agree to an investigation within one year of completion of the McMaster Programs. [From: Discipline Commitee, Report of Proceedings, The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, pp.9-10, February, 1989.] FOLLOW-UP OF FAITH HEALER'S PATIENTS FINDS NO MIRACLES Reporter C. Eugene Emery, Jr, of Providence, Rhode Island, conducted a follow-up investigation of people who were alleged to have been cured by faith healer Rev. Ralph A. DiOrio, a catholic priest, in a November, 1987, faith healing service held in Worcester, Massachusetts. Emery's 9-page report entitled \"are they really cured?\" appeared in the Sunday Journal Magazine, section of the Providence Journal, 1/15/89. Emery evaluated twenty-eight people who claimed cures. Ten of these were chosen at his request by DiOrio's own organization as representing their 10 \"best\" cases. None could be established as having been cured. In some it could not be established that they actually had the diagnosis they claimed. Others were not cured according to their doctors. Still other \"cures\" were most likely attributable to medical treatment or the natural history of the disease. Nevertheless, all continued to believe that they had experienced a miracle despite the paucity of evidence. Emery's case by case description is interesting and useful. Even more fascinating is the willingness of believers to cling to their beliefs in the face of counter evidence. This report exposes the invalidity of personal testimonials in cases of alleged faith healing-with some implications for any healing experience which encourages the \"will to believe.\" SUBLIMINAL SEDUCTION IN MARKETING \"Ever since September of 1957, when movie theatre patrons were alleged to have been subliminally induced to buy popcorn and Coca Cola, covert manipulation has been regarded by some writers as a serious possibility entailing an unconscionable invasion of privacy.\" So begins Thomas Moore's \"The case against subliminal manipulation\" (Psychology & Marketing, Special Issue: Subliminal Influences in Marketing, Vol.5, No.4, pp.297-316, Winter, 1988). Moore does not claim that advertisers cannot induce people to buy things, but he does make a case against subliminal influence. He notes that attempts at marketing applications of subliminal motivation haven't even established awareness thresholds. Moore discusses problems associated with attempting to conduct valid research on the question, and some unusual topics such as backward messaging on rock & roll records. This is not light reading, but it is helpful to anyone interested in claims regarding subliminal massaging. HYDROGEN PEROXIDE POISONINGS A 35% solution of hydrogen peroxide (10 times stronger than the 3% solution commonly used as a disinfectant) has been touted as \"Hyper-oxygenation Therapy\" for AIDS, cancer and more than 60 other conditions. Although the promoters of 35% H202 solution dub it \"food grade\" (an unrecognized term), in fact, H202 is highly corrosive and dangerous at that concentration. This was tragically demonstrated recently when a mother took a bottle of what she thought was water from her refrigerator and poured drinks for her two children and the child of a neighbor. The neighbor's child died and the others were severely injured. The H202 had been obtained by mail-order as an \"alternative medicine.\" Such products are sold under such labels as \"Biowater\" and \"H202.\" Federal officials have been trying to block promotion of the chemical since 1985. [The Morning Call, (Allentown, PA) April 14, 1989.] FDA reports a second case of H2O2 poisoning that involved a similar incident in which a 4-year-old child mistook H2O2 in a refrigerator container for water and served drinks to her two brothers. The resulting injuries required more than 6-months of medical care and cost thousands of dollars (FDA press release no. P89-18, 4/13/89). Comment: Defenders of quackery may argue that the above cases are no different than any other child-poisoning from the medicine cabinet, and should be thought of simply as unfortunate events. NCAHF contends that they differ in one important way: there was no potential benefit to having 35% H202 in the house, only risk. People cannot avoid living with risks, but only those offering proven benefits can be justified. AUTHOR RETRACTS FALSE STATEMENTS ABOUT NCAHF PRESIDENT To avoid a lawsuit, Sandi Mitchell, author of But It Really Works, has apologized to NCAHF President William Jarvis for using his name and making false statements about him and NCAHF. Mitchell states that she will split the book, remove references to Jarvis, and have it rebound. The book is largely an attack on registered dietitians for their attempts to outlaw unqualified nutritionists through state licensure. Mitchell had promulgated false statements originating with Clinton Miller and the National Health Federation that Jarvis and NCAHF have received large sums of money from the pharmaceutical industry and are working in secret with MDs and dentists to destroy freedom of choice in health care. She also made these false statements in an article published by Health Store News, Feb-March, 1987. Mitchell lists her training to be in psychology, sociology and guidance counseling. She also claims a \"PhD\" from unaccredited Donsbach University. TOXICITY OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE According to Dreisbach's Handbook of Poisoning, 10th Edition (Los Altos: Lange Medical Publ, 1980, p.371, concentrated solutions (20-30%) of are strong irritants to the skin or mucous membranes, and 6% is a weak irritant. When used as a colonic lavage, H202 has caused gas embolism and gangrene of the intestine at concentrations down to 0.75%. Gosselin, Smith and Hodge (Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products, 5th Edition, Baltimore: Williams & Wilkins Publ, 1984) state that decomposition of H202 may release large volumes of oxygen (10 times the volume of the solution). Cases of rupture of the colon, proctitis, and ulcerative colitis have been reported following H202 enemas. Powders and tablets that generate H202 have caused oral and esophageal burns when ingested. PHYSICIANS GROUP RELEASES POSITION PAPER ON QUACKERY The American College of Physicians have released a position paper on health quackery. The document was published in the ACP Observer in April, 1989 (Vol.9, No.4). ACP defines health quackery as \"the promotion and commercialization of unproven and potentially dangerous health products and procedures.\" It points out that quackery's essential elements are deception and a primary concern for profit, and that the deception invariably includes omission of adverse information regarding efficacy or safety. The position paper makes it clear that it is not addressing the intentional, unnecessary and inappropriate use of otherwise legitimate tests and therapies by some practitioners. That type of substandard care is to be addressed by future position papers. The ACP supports an informed and active opposition to fraudulent treatment practices. It encourages physicians to (1) elicit information from their patients about use of dubious products and services; (2) be knowledgeable about quackery; (3) to be active in their communities in raising public awareness about the lack of scientific evidence supporting dubious practices; and, (4) to report questionable health products and practices to the appropriate authorities. Comment: ACP deserves commendation for its action. Outside observers may find it surprising, but public declarations encouraging members to actively oppose quackery are rare. NCAHF's experience has been that medical doctors tend to view quackery as inevitable and invincible. Many simply give up without a fight. NCAHF points out that quackery's inevitability is like that of disease and death, and just as physicians do not give up on these human problems, neither should they surrender to quackery without a fight. The realistic goal is not to eliminate quackery, but to minimize its negative impact upon society. CALIFORNIA MIDWIFE CONVICTED Rosalie Tarpening, 62-year-old lay midwife, has been convicted of second-degree murder in the stillbirth of a baby girl delivered after 50-hours of labor. Philip Coscia said that his wife, Susan, 37, begged to be taken to the hospital during the delivery but Tarpening talked her out of it saying that \"it was the most natural thing for a baby to be born.\" Tarpening denied this saying that she recommended hospitalization when the labor failed to progress. The jury did not believe her. Experts testified that the baby would probably have lived if medical care had been solicited early in her labor. Tarpening was also convicted of the unrelated offenses of practicing foot reflexology, iridology, and colonic irrigation. Ten years ago, Tarpening was convicted of practicing medicine without a license in Madera County after a newborn with breathing problems died. Tarpening, a Jehovah's Witness, never attended college, but has a certificate from the now-defunct Los Angeles College of Physical Therapy. She believes that she is being persecuted for using \"alternative therapies.\" Her conviction carries a maximum sentence of 15 years to life imprisonment. She is to be sentenced in August. (San Francisco Examiner, 5/21/89.) HOW MEDICAL DOCTORS VIEW CHIROPRACTORS Family physicians in the State of Washington were surveyed about their knowledge and views of chiropractors; 79% (476) responded. 66% indicated discomfort with what DCs do while acknowledging their effectiveness with some patients; 25% viewed DCs as an excellent source of care for some musculoskeletal problems. Only 3% regarded DCs as quacks that patients should avoid. In spite of the AMA's previous injunction against referring patients to DCs, 57% admitted that they had done so. (Cherkin, et al., \"Family physicians' views of chiropractors: hostile or hospitable? Am J Public Health, 79:636-7, 1989). Comment: This study provides evidence that the AMA's ethical prohibition against cooperating with DCs was ineffective. In her dubious antitrust decision against the AMA, Judge Susan Getzendanner held that the ethical prohibition was probably effective despite an absence of evidence establishing that it was so. This assumption weighed heavily upon her issuance of an injunction. GERMANIUM CLAIMS CALLED \"PURE GOBBLEDYGOOK\" Health food companies are marketing germanium as an \"adaptogen,\" which they define as something that enhances the body's ability to cope with any stress, or as an \"electronutrient,\" which supposedly \"optimizes life force.\" The University of California, Berkeley Wellness Letter (June, 1989) calls such claims \"pure gobbledygook,\" but point out that the FDA does not consider them to be medical claims. They say that FDA banned the import of germanium from Japan last June, but that American companies are still marketing domestic products. Long-term use of germanium has been implicated as a factor in kidney failure. Economic damage may be caused by the fact that germanium pills can cost consumers anywhere from $1 to $12 a day. Comment: FDA again demonstrates its inability or lack of will to curtail quackery by not recognizing that terms \"adaptogen\" and \"optimizes life force\" clearly represent claims to alter bodily functions. Just because the promoters of quackery employ vague pseudoscientific language instead of more precise medical terms is no reason to ignore the ultimate purpose of such language. CAUSE OF ADVERSE REACTION TO USA FIBER BAR Many readers will recall USA, Inc., which must have set some kind of records for slick salesmanship and a supernova-like burn out. One of the problems USA, Inc. had with its product line involved adverse reactions to their Fiber Energy bar or Calorie Control Formula. Despite the fact that the company is gone, the scientific mop-up continues. Allergists Atkins, Wilson and Bock report that the cause of the adverse reactions appears most likely to have been cottonseed protein sensitivity. Seven subjects who experienced the reactions were evaluated by skin-testing and double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges. An unwillingness to subject patients to serious adverse reactions limited the methodology somewhat, but the cause of the problem was reasonably established. (J of Allergy Clin Immunology, 82:242-50, 1988) REVIEW OF NRDC PESTICIDES BOOK The book Pesticide Alert: A Guide to Pesticides in Fruits and Vegetables, (San Francisco: Sierra Club Books, 1988) by Lawrie Mott and Karen Synder of the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) is reviewed by Robert M. Hollingsworth, Director of the Pesticide Research Center at Michigan State University. From Hollingsworth's review, it is clear that the NRDC-Sierra Club publication lives up to its to-be-expected biases, but the reviewer is fairer to the authors than they are to their topic. He gives credit for helping draw attention to several needs in refining and improving ways to ensure that pesticides to not constitute a health threat to consumers. Hollingsworth provides substantive criticism of major flaws in the authors' statements and examples. His review will be useful to anyone attempting to balance the overstatements of the radical environmentalist movement. (Chemical & Engineering News, 5/8/89, pp.35-6). SHOULD FOOD TERRORISTS BE HELD LEGALLY LIABLE? Daniel E. Koshland, Jr. editorializes in Science (4/7/89) that it is time to recognize that public interest groups have conflicts of interest, just as do business groups. \"Businesses prefer to be out of the limelight; public interest groups like to be in it,\" says Koshland. \"Because they are selling products in the marketplace, businesses downplay discussions of hazard. Because public interest groups acquire members by publicity, they emphasize hazards. Each group convinces itself that its worthy goals justify oversimplification to an 'ignorant' public. Businesses today have product liability and can incur legal damages if they place a dangerous product on the market. Public interest groups have no such constraints at the moment; it may be time to develop appropriate ones so that victims of irresponsible information have redress. Public interest groups, as well as apple growers, contribute importantly to our society, but both groups should be accountable for their acts.\" USE OF \"ALTERNATIVE\" THERAPIES BY AIDS PATIENTS Roger Hand, MD, (University of Illinois at Chicago) interviewed 50 AIDS patients about their use of so-called \"alternative\" therapies. For comparison, Dr. Hand also interviewed 30 cancer patients and 64 patients with other medical conditions. Eighteen of the 50 were using one or more alternative therapies compared to 2 of 30 cancer patients and 3 of 64 general medical patients. The therapies used by the AIDS patients were acupuncture (15 patients), imagery (12), massage therapy (11), megavitamins (10), acupressure (8), unapproved medications (7), and high cereal diet (1). Two cancer patients and one general patient used imagery, and two general patients used megavitamins. Treatments were obtained from local nonphysician practitioners, many of whom worked in community-organized alternative care clinics. All of the AIDS patients believed the remedies to be of value, but none expected to be cured by them. (New Engl J Med, 320:672-3, 1989) VITAMIN TELEMARKETING SCAM Two people have been charged with \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" in connection with a vitamin telemarketing scam in Connecticut. Biagio A. Marra and Alphonse Cassanova of the Vita-Plus company allegedly grossed $286,115 during the four months they sold vitamins over the telephone. More than 80 complaints were received from dissatisfied customers who apparently were misled on the price of the supplements ($3.95 became $395.00) and prizes they expected to receive. (The News-Times (Danbury, CT, 3/30/89.) ANTIFLUORIDATIONISTS LAUNCH NEW PROPAGANDA ATTACK After several years of relative quiet, John Yiamouyannis, the world's leading antifluoridationist, has launched a new blitz. After failing to convince people that fluoridation is unsafe, JY's newest claim is that it is not effective. JY obtained raw survey data from the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR) through the Freedom of Information Act and \"analyzed\" it by to his own unconventional methods (for instance, JY claims to have \"age-adjusted\" DMFT rates by adding the DMFT rates for each of 13 age groups and dividing by 13 which would yield an average, but not an age-adjusted average). Since NIDR has not yet published a proper analysis of the raw data, there is nothing to compare with JY's calculations. A review of the handling of JY's \"study\" becomes an instructional classic in media manipulation. JY submitted his paper to Community Dentistry & Oral Epidemiology (CD&OE), a peer-reviewed journal. Without waiting for acceptance, JY circulated copies to other antifluoridationists puffing its importance by informing them that it had been submitted to CD&OE. On May 1, the Center for Health Action (an antifluoridation agency JY founded) held a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, DC, at which he presented the results of his \"study.\" A chorus of antifluoridation litany has followed JY's announced study. Antifluoridationist Bette Hileman, an associate editor at Chemical & Engineering News (C&EN), misrepresented JY's monograph as \"New studies (plural) cast doubt on fluoridation benefits\" (C&EN, 5/8/89) in which she attempts to increase JY's credibility by stating that his article has been submitted to the Danish journal (the article was eventually rejected). She also attempts to build credibility by noting that the union of professional employees at the Environmental Protection Agency has written a letter to EPA Administrator, William Reilly asking him to suspend EPA's unqualified support of fluoridation. She doesn't reveal that the union local leader is an antifluoridationist. Hileman wrote an antifluoridation article disguised by the title \"Special Report: Fluoridation of Water,\" that appeared in the 8/1/88 C&EN. The article was so biased that even Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, MD, took time to write a lengthy rebuttal (C&EN, 11/28/88). In December, 1988, the US Public Health Service's Dental Disease Prevention Activity Center for Prevention Services at Atlanta issued a four-page response to Hileman's article noting that Hileman's article was \"highly slanted, giving credibility to anti-fluoridation claims that have been proven unsubstantiated.\" Unfortunately, the antifluoridationists have already won something from this fiasco. Research shows that the mere mention of controversial issues creates a negative bias against a technology (J Communication, Spring, 1981). Few editors are sufficiently informed on fluoridation to spot disinformation. As a result, this antifluoridation propaganda will be inadvertently spread by well-intended publishers. The NCAHF main office in Loma Linda will supply readers with copies of the antifluoridation articles and/or rebuttals for its usual service and postage charges. NCAHF also has articles that expose JY's fallacious cancer-fluoridation links. [According to a report in The Atlanta Constitution (4/20/78), JY served as a nutrition adviser to the parents of 4-year-old Chad Green during the time the Greens were deciding how to treat little Chad's acute lymphocytic leukemia. The Greens illegally removed Chad from Massachusetts, taking him to Tijuana for laetrile treatment where the boy died. The case was nationally-publicized in the 1970s.] [Hide Full Content](#twenty-nine-thousand-eight-hundred-ninety-three) [NCAHF News, Volume #5 ADVERTISING MAILERS IN DISGUISEThe Journal of Longevity: Medical Research Reviews in Preventive Medicine Fields looks like a magazine.

NOSTRUM MOGUL TAKES THE FIFTH AT SENATE HEARINGA. Glenn Braswell the nostrum mogul who received one of the controversial pardons granted by President Clinton, exercised his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to answer questions that might be self-incriminating at a U.S. Senate Special Aging Committee hearing on September 10th. The hearing focused on \"Swindlers, Hucksters, and Snake Oil Salesmen: The Hype and Hope of Marketing Anti-Aging Products to Seniors.\" Braswell is the president of several companies. One of his companies sends consumers advertising mailers, such as the so-called Journal of Longevity, which deceptively promote products sold by Braswell's Gero Vita International with claims of anti-aging, aphrodisiac, and other types of health-enhancement. The editor of the \"Journal,\" Ron Tepper, also took the Fifth. NCAHF Board members Robert S. Baratz, MD, PhD, DDS and Timothy N. Gorski, MD testified at the hearing and observed Braswell's appearance. \"His face was shrunken,\" said Dr. Baratz of Braswell. \"He has the brown-tan, leathery skin similar to someone with renal failure. He appears to be skin and bones. His hair was missing large patches, and was very fine textured. These are clinical signs of malnutrition. He could barely get out his words.\" In February The New York Times reported that Braswell was 57. Dr. Baratz testified that the \"health freedom\" movement is a major danger; he called it \"health tyranny.\" Its \"promoters and profiteers have put up this 'smoke screen' to obscure their real agenda, which is to escape the reins of evidence and regulations so that they can enrich themselves.\" Dr. Baratz warned the Committee about \"Redefinitions of the New Age\" such as \"alternative medicine.\" He pointed out that \"[t]he 'alternative' to scientific, evidence-based medical practices is non-evidence based, non-scientific nonsense.\" He provided several examples of pseudoscientific experimentation disguised as patient care such as the dental amalgam removal scam and inappropriate uses of chelation therapy. He called for a serious reappraisal of the Dietary Supplement and Health Education Amendment of 1994 (DSHEA) and offered suggestions for Congressional action such as the development of legislation \"to allow states' attorneys general to get nationwide injunctions against sales and distribution of illegitimate and falsely advertised products.\" Dr. Gorski testified that in 1984 Congressman Claude Pepper's Subcommittee on Health and Long-Term Care of the Select Committee on Aging recognized quackery as a scandal. He noted that today quackery thrives, disguised as \"alternative\" medicine, which he called \"a huge business that is at once a media darling, a feeder at the public trough, and a threat to the public health.\" A deceptive 1993 survey of Americans received widespread, uncritical acceptance as evidence that a huge proportion of Americans regularly use methods marketed as \"alternative.\" This mistaken belief was used to support misguided policies. Congress established the Office of Alternative Medicine and then the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. These organizations were staffed and controlled by advocates. The White House Commission for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy was formed with advocates as its appointees. DSHEA became law and opened the floodgates for marketing of products that had been condemned by the Pepper Subcommittee. Dr. Gorski concluded: \"There cannot be two kinds of drugs: those with a known composition, quality, potency, effects, hazards, interactions, and so on, and those about which all these things are little more than a guess. Neither can there be two standards of advertising for such products: one that requires a competent scientific basis before it is disseminated and one in which, for all practical purposes, anything goes. To have it otherwise, ultimately, is to have two kinds of law: one ruled by facts and reason, and one that is not subject to such \"traditional,\" \"orthodox,\" and \"conventional\" considerations. Testimony by Mike O'Neil, the former chief financial officer of Braswell's companies, provided an insider's view of Braswell's business dealings. He said that the articles in the Journal of Longevity routinely contained false statements and \"every word is designed to do one thingsell Braswell product.\" \"The products sold by the Braswell companies are rotated through the Journal with new product names and articles concocted as necessary,\" stated O'Neil. \"That is, if a product does not do well, it is renamed and given life in treating some other malady.\" O'Neil detailed Braswell's elaborate and effective strategy hindering regulatory agencies from having an impact on his businesses. O'Neil mentioned that he is part of on an ongoing IRS investigation of Braswell's role in a \"massive off shore tax evasion scheme.\" The published testimony by Jane Heinrich, U.S. General Accounting Office director of health care and public health issues is entitled Health Products for Seniors: Potential Harm from \"Anti-Aging\" Products. It includes a table listing the 16 most frequently used herbal and specialty supplements (according to a Prevention magazine survey) the principal claims, principal known adverse effects, principal contraindications, and principal known interactions with medications. It states that \"evidence demonstrates that many senior citizens use anti-aging products and that consumers who suffer from aging-related health conditions may be at risk of physical and economic harm from some anti-aging and alternative health products, including dietary supplements that make misleading advertising and labeling claims.\" Joyce C. Lashof, MD, representing the University of California, Berkeley Wellness Letter, provided testimony about how the dietary supplement marketplace since the passage of the ill-conceived DSHEA misleads consumers into wasting their money on unnecessary or dangerous products. She stated that the Wellness Letter published a review of 70 dietary supplements at its Web site (www.wellnessletter.com). Also testifying at the hearing were E. Vernon F. Glenn, Esq. (who represents sports celebrities who have accused Braswell of defaming them through unauthorized use of their likenesses in direct mail advertising), Maryland attorney general Joseph Curran, and officials from the FDA, FTC, and FBI.

BOGUS IMMUNOTHERAPY PROMOTER SENTENCEDOn October 20th notorious medical impostor and phony immunotherapy investment scammer Gregory Caplinger received a 14-year prison sentence from U.S. District Judge Thomas Wiseman for wire fraud and money laundering charges. Caplinger swindled nearly $2 million dollars from investors in ImmuStim, a concoction he misrepresented as effective in treating AIDS and other diseases. Judge Wiseman ordered Caplinger to pay his victims about $1 million restitution. Caplinger had been convicted by a federal jury in North Carolina on July 20, 2000, but he failed to show up to hear the verdict and became a fugitive wanted by the FBI. In June Dominican Republic authorities arrested Caplinger and later turned him over to the FBI. While attending his sentencing hearing, Caplinger's Dominican fianc\u00e9 and alleged accountant, Flavia Berroa was arrested. She was charged with harboring a fugitive. [Frazier E. Medical swindle draws 14 years. The Charlotte Observer, October 31, 2001.] AVERTING A NUTRITION CULTISM FAMILY TRAGEDY: A FATHER'S STORYThe following e-mail messages were received by NCAHF in September. They are reprinted with the sender's permission, but edited for space and clarity. The real names of family members are changed to maintain the anonymity of the family. Dear Sirs: Finding your Web page was a relief. I need some help (or suggestions, or guidance, ANYTHING), on how to deal with a specific family situation involving my in-laws, my wife, and my children. (We currently live with my in-laws and we will continue to live with them for the next year or so.) My father-in-law, now 52 years of age, discovered one year ago that he has an incurable chronic disease. Since that discovery, his wife has leaped into alternative medicine in an attempt to heal him; her logic and discerning capacity are now gone. My mother-in-law, began her adventure with Dr. Norman W. Walker and his book Colon Health Key to Vibrant Life, which advocates weekly, if not daily, colonics. After that it was the turn of Dr. Wallach and his \"Dead Doctors Don't Lie\" audiotape. [Ed: See NCAHF Newsletter January/February 1998 and March/April 1996.] Now it is Dr. Lorraine Day and her \"cure-all\" videotapes. Then came the \"Hallelujah Diet.\" [Ed: Promoters say the diet is based on God's original instructions in Genesis 1:29.] Recently she just started to listen to another audiotape about \"Germs do not cause disease.\" Personally, I cannot stand even to be in the same room when she and my wife are listening to these tapes. Needless to say most of this material lacks any reference list, names, studies or any background information. Every time I attempt, with some solid data on hand, to debunk some of this psycho-health terror I am told: \"Maybe they know something you and the doctors don't know.\" And: \"You know, the doctors and the pharmaceutical companies do not want people to know how to get healthy.\" Here are some of my mother-in-law's beliefs: - Frequent \"colonics\" are needed to \"detoxify\" yourself. - Drinking lots of water cures most disease. - Doctors and modern medicine have not cured any disease ever, not even one. - Milk and sugar cause AIDS and most of the disease we currently know. - Cooked food has zero nutritional value-no proteins, nothing, nada, empty food. Only raw foods have nutritional value and have the \"enzymes of life.\" - Veggie and raw food diets cure AIDS and cancer and most disease. - Dialysis can be avoided by following a regimen of mineral and vitamin supplements. - Germs/bacteria and viruses never cause any disease. The disease is inside us and we start it by what we eat. - 25% of American couples are infertile because they do not take minerals in their diet. - Kids under the age of ten are dying of heart attacks all over America because of lack of minerals. Trust me people this is not a joke. My stomach turns every time I hear any of this crap. All of this is coupled with a change in diet that involves the entire family. We are going toward a more vegetarian style of eating habits, and I need to say that I do not have anything against it. I wholeheartedly agree that we need to have good, healthy meals and frequent exercise. (Personally, I draw the line on the barely green powder; it is just awful and in my opinion, totally useless junk.) We have three wonderful kids: Peter, 9; Rachel, 5; and Mark, 3. They are healthy and healthy-looking. They eat well (lots of veggies and fruits as well as all the rest). Here is the problem. My mother-in-law has convinced my wife to have cow milk banned from the kids. (I am the only one who drinks milk-in my coffee.) Soy milk ONLY is allowed for the kids. I have mixed feelings about this, and occasionally \"smuggle\" my kids a great bowl with cereal, fresh fruits and some good God-sent cow milk, thanks very much. Otherwise, as soon as any one of my kids reaches for the milk carton, here comes the yell: \"Do you want to get an ear infection? Don't you know that milk can kill you?\" I have spoken loudly against this and said that I consider it under \"psychological child abuse.\" But I am hitting a brick wall here. Now, here is the twist: my wife, on suggestion from my mother-in-law, wants to put Peter on a 7-day juice-only fast in order to \"cure\" and \"detoxify\" him from the \"poisons\" that cause his ear infections. They also want to give him \"fruit juices injected via rectum\" if he is too sick to eat. Colloidal silver [Ed: see NCAHF Newsletter November/December 1996] has been discussed for the kids too, as a form of \"cure-all\" antibiotic. At this point I got REALLY concerned, set my foot down and told my wife that we really needed to have a serious talk about this \"alternative medicine\" situation. I consider these practices on a child to be very dangerous, and borderline child abuse. There is no way I will allow my kids to be subject to the juice fast, colloidal silver or anything like that. I agree completely with this statement on your Web site: \"children should have access to rational, responsible health care.\" You see, I am used to a different approach towards doctors. I go to see the doctor, as needed, and use some good, old common sense. I rely on solid logic, facts, and nothing of all this nonsense. Do you have any suggestions? Should I talk with our pediatrician (without my wife present)? One more thing: (rhetorical question): How on earth can otherwise \"normal\" people cave in and believe all this nonsense? Thanks, Concerned father in Texas. NCAHF replied with a note that validated the father's concerns, pointed out that NCAHF has contacts with child healthcare advocates in Texas, and invited the father to contact NCAHF by phone. The father replied via e-mail as follows. Dear Mr. London, Thanks for your prompt reply to my e-mail. Please accept my apologies for such a late reply to your letter. Things are improving since I wrote to you. I showed my letter and your reply to my wife and we had a long, late-night talk about the entire issue. I also printed a lot of material from your Web site and gave her a good read about lots of these \"health gurus.\" Some of her repeated comments were: \"NO WAY!\" And, \"Oh my gosh!\" And later on, \"How can they do that?\" She is very upset for having allowed her emotions and hope for good health to come into the way of her judgment and common sense. So juice fast and the other stuff is out of discussion in our family. We will continue with our healthier nutritional habits, since my cholesterol level is quite high and I really need to bring it down. Oh yes, and new running shoes too. So, I am glad that thanks to your Web site and your help, my wife opened her eyes. As for my mother-in-law, well, we will try to approach her one step at a time, since I am afraid she is into this big time. For now, I ordered some books for her to read, and I will have her read some stuff off your Web site too. You know, it is sad. My mother-in-law is an exquisite person. She is a businesswoman, 49 years old, a very nice lady with a degree, and really down to earth. She loves her family and her grandchildren with all of her heart and would do nothing to hurt anybody. Unfortunately, she also happens to be a little bit too trusting of \"printed paper\" and a very easy target for scams of many sorts. It would be interesting to see on your Web site a section on the psychological angle of health fraud. Why do otherwise normal people fall so easily and deeply and become prey of these alt-medicine practitioners? Well, Mr. London, thanks again for your help. I will be happy to visit your Web site often and keep it handy as a source of debunking of false science. Thanks!
