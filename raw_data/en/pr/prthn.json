While the available evidence indicates the direct impact of COVID-19 on child and adolescent mortality is limited,1 the indirect mortality effects of the pandemic - resulting from over-stretched health systems, disruptions to care-seeking and preventative interventions like vaccination and nutrition, household income loss, lockdowns, masking, handwashing and social distancing - are not yet well understood. This lack of clarity is particularly acute in the many low- and middle-income countries that do not have well- functioning surveillance and data systems. An uncertain trajectory As the pandemic unfolded and only fractured and limited empirical information on its impacts was available, some projections and models2, 3, 4 predicted high numbers of additional child deaths resulting from the indirect effects mentioned above. Based on the results of some of these modelling exercises, this report's 2020 edition stressed the critical importance of maintaining life-saving interventions and services for children and women during the pandemic to ensure hard- won gains in combating child mortality were not lost. Now, the availability of empirical mortality data - reported birth, death and population counts from vital registration systems or health information systems in over 80 countries or areas - makes it possible to more directly, albeit partially, assess the mortality situation of children and youth in 2020, the most recent year reported in this round of UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) estimates. Incomplete picture, long-term outcomes unknown Thus far, these data from over 80 countries and areas do not show the feared reversal in child mortality gains in 2020 that was projected by some early modelling based on assumed service disruptions. While about half the countries with available data for 2020 excess mortality analysis are high-income countries, evidence from low- and middle-income countries - e.g., Brazil, India, Kenya, Mexico, Mozambique and South Africa - similarly showed little impact on national-level child, adolescent and youth mortality in 2020. Following analysis of these data and recommendations from its Technical Advisory Group, the UN IGME has not adjusted the 2020 rate for COVID-19-related mortality (see 'Box: COVID-19 and Child and Youth Mortality in 2020' on p. 6 for more details). The estimates in this report are based on empirical data up to 2020, where available, or extrapolation to 2020 by continuing recent trends from the most recent empirical data point available. Still, as more quality data become available for 2020, further monitoring is needed for a more complete picture of child, adolescent and youth mortality as well as the relevant contributing factors. For instance, fewer injuries, a decline in cases of certain infectious diseases, and reductions in exposure to air pollution due to social distancing, masking, and increased handwashing may have contributed to the observed continuous decline in child mortality. Meanwhile, warnings from various studies and organizations emphasizing the critical importance of maintaining life-saving interventions and services for children and women may have led countries and stakeholders to take action to protect more child and adolescent lives during the pandemic. Indeed, some health services and interventions rebounded in the latter half of 2020 4after an initial reduction immediately following the onset of the pandemic5 , and disruptions to interventions were rarely reported as severe6, 7. More data and research are urgently needed to foster a more nuanced understanding of how and why child mortality has changed since the pandemic began, and to ensure children and adolescents do not succumb to preventable deaths. The pandemic itself is still unfolding - and because the data remain poor, outcomes for children and adolescents in 2021 and beyond remain unknown. The COVID-19 pandemic may affect child mortality differently by age group and socioeconomic status; for instance, newborns and children from poor households may require more protection and intervention to avoid unnecessary loss of life than other children. While the child and adolescent estimates published in this year's Levels and Trends in Child Mortality are the most robust estimates for 2020 based on available information and data as of the publication date, caution is needed when interpreting these results given the data limitations. Too many lives lost Even without COVID-19-related mortality adjustments, the death toll is still staggering: More than 5 million children died before turning 5 in 2020 alone. Tragically, much of this loss of life could have been prevented. These deaths are not carried equally around the world - children in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia continue to face the highest risk of death and to bear the brunt of the child mortality burden. As the world attempts to vaccinate widely to reduce preventable deaths due to COVID-19, it is also time to remember and renew our commitment to ending all preventable child deaths that devastate millions of families year after year. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)8 call for an end to preventable deaths of newborns and children under age 5, with all countries aiming to have a neonatal mortality rate of 12 or fewer deaths per 1,000 live births and an under-five mortality rate of 25 or fewer deaths per 1,000 live births by 2030. If these goals are to be met, the global community must double down on its efforts to ensure the most vulnerable children survive, wherever they are. But current trends are cause for alarm: More than 50 countries will not meet the under-five mortality target by 2030 and more than 60 countries will miss the neonatal mortality target without immediate action. Access to effective and high- quality care along with continued expansion of coverage of life-saving interventions and strong primary health care will bring countries closer to achieving these goals. If every country met or exceeded the SDG target, 8 million under-five deaths could be averted between 2021 and 2030. Urgent need to fill data gaps The burden of child deaths is disproportionately carried on the shoulders of too few. These inequitable deaths, coupled with the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, leave no doubt that monitoring must be sustained and expanded to accurately track progress towards global goals, inform policy to ensure greater survival, and respond to sudden shocks like the pandemic. Timely, high-quality and disaggregated data are critical to achieving this goal. The substantial data gaps (e.g., only 40 countries have high-quality nationally representative under-five mortality data for 2020) pose enormous challenges to policy and decision-making. Investments in data collection systems and concerted efforts to improve the availability, quality and robustness of mortality data must be continued for greater accuracy and timeliness in monitoring the survival situation for children, adolescents and youth. 5Since the first deaths from COVID-19 were reported in early 2020, there has been immense concern as to the lethality and vulnerability to the illness by age. Even as evidence began to emerge in 2020 showing COVID-19's very modest direct impact on child and young people's mortality, numerous governments, aid organizations, and medical and scientific institutions grew concerned with the possible increase in indirect deaths among children and youth due to disruption of specific interventions and services that have proven to be critical in saving children and women's lives in low- and middle-income countries. These deaths could stem from the repercussions of strained and under-resourced health systems, limitations on care-seeking and preventative measures like vaccination and nutrition supplements, or socioeconomic strains on households resulting from job losses, economic contractions or even deaths of parents due to COVID-19. Early scenario-based modelling warned that increases in wasting coupled with severe and sustained reduction in the coverage of basic life- saving interventions - antenatal care, childbirth delivery care, postnatal care, vaccinations, and early childhood preventative and curative services - could substantially increase under-five deaths, essentially reversing a decades-long decline in global under-five mortality.2 These scenarios were based on assumptions of large and blanket reductions (about 40 per cent to 50 per cent) in intervention coverage across all services, irrespective of service delivery platform, and increases in wasting. Later modelling using actual reports of observed service disruptions in a smaller number of countries did estimate some additional mortality, but to a lesser degree and with less severe disruptions to services than the earlier modelling.9 Modelling for specific causes of death has also used reported service disruptions to predict an increase in under-five deaths. For instance, additional malaria-related child deaths have been estimated for 2020 triggered by service disruptions.10 Further modelling based on the well-documented inverse relationship between child mortality and economic output or wealth - i.e., economic downturn would be followed by increased numbers of deaths - suggested the damaging financial consequences of the pandemic could mean more children would die.11 Looking back: Child and youth mortality in 2020 Models linking economic downturns or reductions in interventions to more child deaths demonstrate the importance of these factors in determining overall mortality under normal circumstances, and these models can be crucial tools in the absence of empirical evidence to plan and make policy. At the same time, it is also important to review the empirical evidence on child mortality (where available) to determine whether any adjustment is warranted, and if so, to what degree. Empirical mortality data for 2020 has become more available throughout 2021. Based on these empirical data, the UN IGME determined that no COVID-19-related adjustment to its estimates was warranted for 2020. The UN IGME's data collection and analysis of child mortality in 2020 is described below, along with a brief explanation of the gap between the estimates presented in this report and those from the modelling efforts mentioned above. Direct COVID-19 mortality The evidence on deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 infection shows a strong age gradient, with children and adolescents least effected. The COVerAGE database, an open-access database compiled by Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR), contains age- and sex-specific data on COVID-19 deaths for COVID-19 AND CHILD AND YOUTH MORTALITY IN 2020 677 countries in 2020 (see Map 1).12 These data show children and adolescents under age 25 made up just 0.6 per cent of the total reported COVID-19 deaths in the database for 2020 (1.5 million), but 39 per cent of the total population in these countries.13 Moreover, the youngest children are least vulnerable: Of the over 9,900 deaths reported among children and adolescents in 2020, just 27 per cent occurred among children aged 0-9 years, while 42 per cent occurred among youth aged 20-24 years.14 The large number of countries not reporting age-specific deaths information notwithstanding, children and youth are not widely impacted by direct COVID- 19 deaths in this dataset. More information about this dataset and its limitations can be found in the UNICEF dashboard COVID-19 Confirmed Cases and Deaths: Age- and Sex-disaggregated Data , and further information on total COVID-19 deaths and cases by country can be found at the WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard .Excess mortality So far, a relatively small number of direct COVID-19 deaths have been reported among children and young people, but they may be at increased risk of indirect death resulting from disruptions to services, decreased utilization of health services (due to lockdowns or fear of contracting the virus) or economic contractions. One way to analyse the contribution of these indirect deaths to overall mortality is to look at excess mortality during the period of concern, i.e., 2020. Excess mortality is defined as the difference between observed deaths (or mortality rates) over a given period of time, e.g., annual deaths in 2020, and a baseline or expected number of deaths typically based on historical data. Excess mortality results when observed deaths exceed expected deaths. Notably, excess mortality includes all causes of death, and should therefore capture any direct or indirect mortality among children and youth.

Source: UN IGME analysis of COVERAGE database 7To calculate the possible excess mortality in all age groups of interest - neonatal, infant, under-five and 5-24 - the UN IGME undertook an analysis of empirical data derived from civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems and health management information systems (HMIS), i.e., observed number of deaths, for more than 80 countries or areas (see Map 2). These countries or areas account for more than half of total live births and about a third of under-five deaths in 2020; of the 40 countries with the highest burden of under-five deaths, 15 also had data available for this analysis - including Brazil, China, Ethiopia, India, Mexico and South Africa. Likewise, about 50 per cent of the countries in the UN IGME excess mortality analysis are classifed as low- or middle-income countries. The baseline or expected mortality was modelled using historical deaths for 2015- 2019 to predict expected deaths for 2020 with 95 per cent confidence intervals, and ratios of observed deaths to expected deaths were analysed to detect any significant deviations. When the uncertainty in the expected number of deaths is included, only five countries (7 per cent) showed significant, positive excess under- five mortality (see Figure 1), and these countries already had very low mortality in the preceding years. About 51 per cent of countries showed no significant deviation from the expected number of deaths, and 41 per cent showed significantly fewer deaths than would be expected based on historical data. The proportion of countries with significant excess mortality increases with age but maxes out at just 19 per cent of all countries in the 15-19 age group; again, these countries generally have very low mortality in these age groups to begin with. As Map 2 makes clear, one limitation of the CRVS analysis is the reliance on data that disproportionately represent high-income countries - the pandemic is likely to impact countries from other income groups differently. Data source type CRVS data HMIS data No data Note: Gray color-coded countries do not have CRVS, HMIS or other relevant data available and were therefore not included in this analysis. Data for Mozambique are from the COMSA system. This map does not reflect a position by UN IGME agencies on the legal status of any country or territory or the delimitation of any frontiers.MAP 2Countries with 2020 data included in the excess mortality analysis by data source type 8To address this gap, the UN IGME analysed monthly data on births and neonatal, infant and under-five deaths from a dozen low- and middle- income countries' HMIS or other data collection systems, including some with substantial child and youth populations like Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India and Kenya. After applying a similar analysis to the approach used with CRVS data, the HMIS data confirmed the results of the CRVS analysis. Furthermore, data provided to the UN IGME from the Countrywide Mortality Surveillance for Action (COMSA) system in Mozambique and South Africa's Rapid Mortality Surveillance system also showed no excess child mortality in 2020. In fact, the South African data suggest a downward trend in child mortality for 2020.UN IGME estimates and other modelled estimates These empirical data on excess mortality and the UN IGME estimates for 2020 show a continued global decline in mortality, which diverges from the modelling efforts described earlier in this report that predicted the opposite. There are several reasons for this discrepancy. First, the continued decline, and in some cases faster decline, in child mortality in 2020 may be attributable to protective effects of pandemic control measures like mask wearing, handwashing and social distancing that are not considered by these other models. These COVID- 19 preventive measures may also control various infectious diseases that still dominate the cause of death structure for young children in low- and middle-income settings and Negativ e None Positiv eFIGURE 1 Note: The number of countries in each category is shown in parenthesis. Not all countries had age-specific data available for all age groups, and four countries that are not among the 195 countries that UN IGME produces annual estimates for are excluded from this figure. Thus, the number of countries in each age category is not necessarily the same. Source: UN IGME analysisProportion of countries with significant excess mortality in CRVS data for 2020 by age 9limit exposure to negative health factors like air pollution. For example, at end of 2020, reports began to emerge of moderate to minimal flu seasons in various parts of the world, which were thought to result from the dramatic decrease in mobility and social interaction.15, 16 Indeed, the UN IGME analysis not only found scant evidence of increased child mortality in 2020, but also pointed to possible protective effects across childhood and adolescence, and especially in infancy, with far more countries showing lower than expected mortality than excess mortality (see Figure 1). Limits on mobility and social distancing measures may also contribute to declines in mortality at older ages, since adolescents and youth are less likely to die of causes like drowning, injuries or accidents. These protective effects have been observed in some limited cause of death data available from CRVS, and a reduction in mortality from injuries in these age groups has been observed in weekly data from the United States.17 In addition to the possible protective effects of pandemic control measures, it is important to consider the long- and short-term impacts of disruptions to certain interventions. Mortality outcomes for children and adolescents in 2021 and beyond remain unknown as the multiple indirect impacts of the pandemic on child mortality could take time to unfold - while intervention coverage may decrease sharply and suddenly, the impact of reduced specific interventions like nutrition campaigns and immunizations on mortality may take some time to be realized. For instance, in 2020, the number of completely unvaccinated children increased by 3.4 million,18 which is likely to show an impact on mortality over time. At the country level, shrinking government budgets may lead to reduced services for children, which can impact their health and well-being. At the household level, if families fall into poverty, their ability to afford food and services for children will be impacted, and food insecurity can lead to stunting and increased risk of death and poor developmental outcomes in the long term. While the estimates presented in this report refer to the time period up to 2020, these possible long-term impacts on mortality must be considered when collecting and analysing data on excess mortality in 2021 and beyond. Similarly, as the UN IGME produces national- level estimates and is therefore concerned with whether to make adjustments at that level, it must also be noted that national averages can obscure subnational-level variation. For instance, the pandemic's impact may vary regionally within a country or differentially impact families at opposite ends of household wealth scales. Therefore, along with continued national-level monitoring, analysis of disaggregated data (where available) will also be critical to fully understand the pandemic's effect on the health and survival of children and youth. The UN IGME estimated mortality rates and assessed whether adjustments needed to be applied to 2020 based on empirical data on mortality itself; in other words, the model does not use covariates to estimate mortality but rather fits a smooth trend line through observed data on mortality. The modelling methods mentioned earlier take a different approach, using measures like service disruption or economic changes to predict the number of child deaths. Discrepancies can arise since these models do not consider other relevant factors in determining the total number of deaths, such as the protective effects discussed above. These models rightly demonstrate the potential impact of interventions or economic downturns on mortality, but do not factor in a possible counterbalance of fewer deaths resulting from protection from common causes of death. Furthermore, some early modelling relied on service disruptions as covariates, and more recent modelling noted service disruptions were not as severe or as long in duration as originally assumed.9 For instance, vaccine dose data from January-December 2019 and 2020, WHO 10regional office reports, and the WHO-led Pulse survey showed a global decline in the number of DTP3 and MCV1 doses administered in the first half of 2020, but this was followed by recovery in the second half of the year.5 Likewise, two WHO-led Pulse surveys on continuity of essential health services from mid-2020 and early 2021 showed that while nearly all countries reported disruption in at least one essential service, these disruptions were rarely reported as 'severe' (i.e., more than 50 per cent of users not serviced as usual).6, 7 While Pulse surveys provide important information on the status of essential service provision, it is difficult to quantify the severity and duration of service disruption from these reports alone, which is the first step in modelling deaths resulting from service disruption. Looking ahead: Strengthening data in 2021 and beyond There appears to be a lack of widespread evidence demonstrating excess mortality among children and youth for 2020 based on available data. However, there is reason to take caution when interpreting these data. Like much data on mortality, the data on COVID-19 deaths are limited in their disaggregation by age and sex, yielding an incomplete picture of the age-specific burdens of direct mortality. They also tend to encompass high-income countries, where well- functioning CRVS systems were in place before 2020 to report detailed data on deaths. While analysis of HMIS data and supporting data from other low- and middle-income countries (e.g., India, Mozambique and South Africa) confirm the CRVS analysis results representing primarily high- income countries and deepen the UN IGME's understanding of the age-mortality dynamics of the pandemic, the excess mortality analysis is lacking in data representing the widest variation in country characteristics. Additionally, the HMIS data themselves have varying degrees of quality and may suffer from under-reporting of births and deaths if, for example, more births or deaths occurred outside of facilities - i.e., at home or in the community. These issues in data collection related to incomplete or delayed reporting must be also be considered when analysing excess mortality data in the near future. Along with the risk of overinterpreting these data, caution should also be taken in assuming 2021 will be like 2020. COVID-19 has shown its ability to change in unpredictable and unexpected ways. The surge of the Delta variant, the rollout and uneven access to vaccines both between and within countries, the relative decline in country- wide lockdown policies and personal precaution taking, and the economy in 2021 are just some of the pandemic's evolving aspects that could result in a different mortality outcome for children and youth in 2021 compared to 2020. Finally, as mentioned above, the excess mortality data analysed also showed some variation by age, with a slight increase in the number of countries showing significant excess mortality at older ages, i.e., 15-24. Likewise, some HMIS data also showed possible excess stillbirths in 2020 in some countries, though neonatal and child mortality show no such increase. While this report does not include stillbirth estimates, more data and research are needed in this area for future sets of estimates. Considering the data limitations and the dynamic nature of this pandemic, continued monitoring of child survival and health with appropriately disaggregated data is essential to early detection and action - particularly if the impact of COVID- 19 were to worsen for children and youth. The pandemic has not only demonstrated the precariousness of survival gains, but also shed light on the inadequacy and inequity of many of our existing mortality monitoring systems to accurately reflect the health and survival situation in parts of the world that are already battling relatively high child and youth mortality rates. The paucity of these data nearly two years into the pandemic reiterate the urgent need to expand and better support the data systems needed to collect timely and detailed mortality data and enable quick responses to rapidly changing conditions. 11Under-five mortality and SDG assessment The continued burden of child mortality represents an enormous loss of life - in 2020 alone, 5.0 (4.8-5.5)19 million children died before reaching their fifth birthday, even without an increase in mortality attributable to COVID- 19. Half of those deaths, 2.4 (2.2-2.6) million, occurred among newborns (Figure 2). Moreover, most of these deaths were preventable. The 5.0 million deaths among children under 5 that occurred in the 12 months of 2020 alone are all the more glaring now that the world has lost close to the same number of people to COVID- 1920 - and has mobilized to slow these vaccine- preventable deaths through immunization programmes. This same level of commitment must be made to lessen the burden of child mortality. Children are still facing wildly divergent chances of leading a healthy life simply based on where they are born and the economic circumstances they are born into. While the global under-five mortality rate (U5MR) fell to 37 (35-40) deaths per 1,000 live births in 2020, children born in sub-Saharan Africa continued to face the steepest odds of survival in the world. The 2020 U5MR for this region was 74 (68-86) deaths per 1,000 live births, 14 times higher than the risk for children FIGURE 2Global mortality rates and number of deaths by age, 2020 Note: All figures are based on unrounded numbers.Mortality rates Number of deaths (in millions and percentage Neonatal (0-27 aged 1,000 17 119 010203040 adolescents asolescents aged 10-14 years 0.4 (5%) 12FIGURE 3Under-five mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 live births) by Sustainable Development Goal region, 1990, 2000 and 2020 Note: All figures are based on unrounded numbers.TABLE 1 Note: All calculations are based on unrounded numbers. 1990 2000 2020 SDG country target for 2030 Sub-Saharan AfricaOceania (exc.

Likewise, children born in low-income countries, where 2020 U5MR was 66 (60-78) deaths per 1,000 live births, were 14 times more likely to die before reaching age 5 than children born in high- income countries (2020 U5MR 5 (5-5) deaths per 1,000 live births). At the country level, under- five mortality rates in 2020 ranged from 2 deaths per 1,000 live births to 115 deaths per 1,000 live births, and the risk of dying before turning 5 for a child born in the highest-mortality country was about 65 times higher than in the lowest-mortality country (see Map 3). The first month of life is the most vulnerable period of child survival. Nearly half (47 per cent) of all under-five deaths in 2020 occurred during the neonatal period - the first 28 days of life. This is an increase from 1990 (40 per cent), as the global level of under-five mortality declines faster than neonatal mortality (see Table 2). Likewise, divergent chances at survival start from the earliest ages - sub-Saharan Africa has the highest neonatal mortality rate in the world, at 27 (25-32) deaths per 1,000 live births, followed by Southern Asia at 23 (21-26) deaths (see Table 3). A child born in sub-Saharan Africa is 11 times more likely to die in the first month of life than a child born in the region of Australia and New Zealand, and a child born in a high-income country has a risk of death in the first month that is just one tenth the risk to a child born in a low-income country. At the country level, neonatal mortality rates in 2020 ranged from 1 death per 1,000 live births to 44, and the risk of dying before the 28th day of life for a child born in the highest-mortality country was about 56 times higher than in the lowest-mortality country (see Map 4). Communicable and infectious diseases continue to be leading causes of under-five deaths. Globally, premature birth and birth complications (birth asphyxia/trauma), pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria remain the leading causes of preventable deaths of children under 5 years old.21 For older children, adolescents and young adults aged 5-24 years, injuries (unintentional and intentional) become the more prominent cause of preventable mortality.22 The burden of child deaths falls hardest on just two regions. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, 2.7 (2.5-3.1) million children died before reaching their fifth birthday - this is 54 per cent of all Note: This map does not reflect a position by UN IGME agencies on the legal status of any country or territory or the delimitation of any frontiers.MAP 3 Under-five mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 live births) >100 75 to 100 50 to 75 25 to 50 10 to 25 10 No dataUnder-five mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 live births) by country, 2020 14TABLE 2 TABLE 3 Note: All calculations are based on unrounded numbers.

Another 27 per cent of the global total of deaths occurred in Southern Asia, with 1.4 (1.2- 1.5) million under-five deaths; Southern Asia accounted for 26 per cent of live births in 2020. These two regions also bear most of the world's newborn deaths, with sub-Saharan Africa leading in the global share of these deaths at 43 per cent (1.0 (0.9-1.2) million), followed by Southern Asia at 36 per cent (0.9 (0.8-0.9) million (see Table 2). Notably, the Southern Asia region has unusually high neonatal mortality given the level of under-five mortality, and neonatal deaths have stagnated at 1 million deaths annually in sub-Saharan Africa even as mortality rates have declined. This is due to an increase in live births in the region in recent years.13 Children living in fragile and conflict-affected situations are especially vulnerable. The under- five mortality rate in the 38 countries classified as fragile and conflict-affected situations23 was 76 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2020, a three-fold increase in risk compared to all other countries. About 43 per cent of global under-five deaths in 2020 occurred in fragile and conflict-affected situations. If current trends continue, 54 countries will not meet the SDG target for under-five mortality. Of the 195 countries analysed in this report, 125 have already met the SDG target on under-five mortality, and 16 countries are expected to do so by 2030. But the pace of mortality decline must quicken if the remaining 54 countries are to meet the target on time. Of these 54, 38 countries will need to more than double their current rate of progress to achieve the SDG target by 2030, without considering the additional challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic or other emergencies (see Figure 4). Even more countries are at risk of missing the SDG target for neonatal mortality. While 122 countries have already achieved the neonatal mortality target, 61 countries will need to accelerate progress to meet the neonatal mortality target by 2030 (see Figure 4) - and 53 countries will need to more than double their current rate of decline to meet the target on time.

Of the 54 countries off track to meet the SDG target on under-five mortality, nearly 75 per cent (40) are in sub-Saharan Africa (see Figure 4), 85 per cent (46) are classified as low- or lower-middle- income countries, and about half are classified as fragile and conflict-affected situations. For the neonatal mortality target, 70 per cent of the countries at risk of missing the target are in sub- Saharan Africa, 84 per cent (51) are low- or lower- middle-income, and 39 per cent are classified as fragile and conflict-affected situations. If countries at risk of missing the SDG target on under-five mortality accelerated progress to achieve it by 2030, 8 million children's lives would be saved. On current trends,24 more than 43 million children younger than 5 will die before 2030, half of them newborns. Well over half of these deaths - 58 per cent - will take place in sub-Saharan Africa (25 million), with another 24 per cent occurring in Southern Asia (10 million). Meeting the SDG target in the 54 countries that are off track would avert 8 million under-five deaths between 2021 and 2030 and reduce the annual number of under-five deaths to 2.5 million in 2030 (see Figure 5). Even more lives could be saved - almost 25 million - if all countries were able to reach an under-five mortality rate equivalent to the average under- five mortality rate in high-income countries (5 deaths per 1,000 live births). Under this scenario, there would be just 700,000 under-five deaths in 2030. Fewer countries showed gender disparities in under-five mortality. The estimated under-five mortality rate for boys in 2020 was 39 (37-42) deaths per 1,000 live births and 34 (33-38) deaths per 1,000 live births for girls. In 2020, an estimated 2.7 (2.6-3.0) million boys and 2.3 (2.2-2.5) girls died before reaching age 5 (see Figure 6). On average, boys are expected to have a higher under-five mortality rate than girls. In some countries, the under-five mortality rate for girls is significantly higher than what would be expected based on global sex-ratio patterns. The number of countries showing higher than expected mortality for girls has fallen from 22 to 5 since 1990. 19Across all regions, the risk of dying between the ages of 5 and 24 is lower than for children under 5 years old. At about half the level of global under-five mortality, the probability of dying among children and youth aged 5-24 years was 18 (17-19) deaths per 1,000 children aged 5 years in 2020 (see Table 5 and Figure 7). Noteably, exposure to the risk of death is four times longer in the age group 5-24 than the under-five age group. Globally, the age pattern of child and youth mortality rates sees mortality fall from the peak of under-five mortality to a low among 10-14 year-olds, then increase again. While the level of mortality differs considerably between regions, this age pattern is generally consistent across regions except for the regions of Australia and New Zealand, Europe and Northern America, and Latin America and the Caribbean, which see the lowest mortality among 5-9 year olds (see Table 5 and Figure 7). Despite lower rates compared to children under 5, an estimated 2.2 (2.1-2.4) million children and young people aged 5-24 years died in 2020, with more than half of those deaths occuring among those aged 15-24 years (see Table 6 and Figure 2). Nearly 1 million adolescents died in 2020. The probability of dying among adolescents aged 10-19 years was estimated at 7.6 (7.3-8.4) deaths per 1,000 children aged 10 years in 2020.

Over 70 per cent of all deaths among 5-24-year-olds occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (45 per cent) and Southern Asia (26 per cent) (see Table 6). If current trends continue, nearly 21 million children and youth aged 5-24 years will die between 2021 and 2030. Of these projected deaths, 8.9 million will occur among adolescents aged 10-19 years, and 72 per cent will occur in just two regions: sub-Saharan Africa (9.9 million) and Southern Asia (4.9 million)that risk is relatively low compared to other age groups presented in this report, 0.9 (0.9-1.0) million adolescents died in 2020. Globally, about 43 per cent of the deaths among those aged 5-24 years occurred among adolescents (see Table 6). Survival chances for children and youth aged 5-24 years depend heavily on the regions and countries they are born into. At 39 (38- 44) deaths per 1,000 children aged 5 years, sub-Saharan Africa has the highest regional probability of dying for the age group 5-24 in 2020, followed by Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) with 21 (17-26) deaths per 1,000, and Southern Asia 16 (15-19) deaths per 1,000 (see Table 5). Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) have the highest regional mortality rates across all four five-year age groups in 2020, save for Latin America and the Caribbean, which replaces Central and Southern Asia with the third highest regional rate for older adolescents aged 15-19 years and youth aged 20-24 years (see Table 5 and Figure 7). The average probability of a five- year-old dying before reaching age 25 was eight times higher in sub-Saharan Africa than in the Australia and New Zealand region, which has the lowest mortality rate for 5-24-year-olds. At the country level, mortality rates for 5-9-year-olds ranged from 0.2 to 16.1 deaths per 1,000 children aged 5 years; for 10-14-year-olds, from 0.2 to 12.9 deaths per 1,000 adolescents aged 10 years ; for 15-19-year-olds, from 0.8 to 18.0 deaths per 1,000 adolescents aged 15 years; and for 20-24-year- olds, from 1.0 to 24.3 deaths per 1,000 youths aged 20 years. Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia carry the heaviest death burden for children and youth FIGURE 7Probability of dying for five-year age groups among children, adolescents and youth by Sustainable Development Goal regions, 20200.5 1.0 2.0 5.0 10.0 20.0 50.0 100.0 AgeProbability of 04 59 1014 1519 2024 SubSahar an Afr ica Oceania (e xc.

On average, the most recent quality data point on child mortality across all countries was 4.8 years old, with half the countries in the world having a data point within the past 3.5 years. For about a third of all countries, the latest available child mortality data point was more than five years old (see Figure 8 and Map 5). Data availability worsens for some regions and income groups. In sub-Saharan Africa, more than half of all countries in the region have a gap of more than five years between the most recent available data point and the common reference year 2020 - globally, just 35 per cent of countries have a most recent data point this old (see Figure 8). Similarly, on average, the most recent data point among low-income countries was 7.3 years old, among middle-income countries 5.1 years old, and among high-income countries 2.6 years old; two thirds of all low- and middle-income countries have no reliable data on under-five mortality in the past three years. Recent data are also rare in fragile and conflict-affected situations - on average, fragile and conflict-affected situations had a most recent data point that was 8.2 years old. Countries at risk of missing the SDGs are less likely to have recent, reliable data on child mortality. Among the countries at risk of missing the SDG target on under-five mortality, the most recent data point on average was 7.4 years old, while countries already achieving the target had an average most recent data point that was just 3.5 years old. Fewer recent data means greater FIGURE 8 Distribution of the country extrapolation periods in each Sustainable Development Goal region and Zealand) SubSahar an Afr icaLatin Amer ica and the Car ibbeanCentr al and Souther n AsiaEaster n and SouthEaster n Asia Northern Afr ica and W ester n AsiaAustralia and Ne w Zealand, Europe and Nor thern Amer ica<= 2 years 25 years 510 years >10 yearsPer cent 23uncertainty in the recent period and greater reliance on extrapolation. Just 40 countries had high-quality national data for 2020 included in the estimation model, though national or subnational data were available for more than 80 countries or areas to help analyse excess mortality due to COVID-19. The countries shown in green in Map 5 have an included data point for 2020 in the estimation model, and data availability for the excess mortality analysis is described in the box on COVID-19 and child mortality (see p. 8). Overall, there are fewer countries with data for 2020 included in the estimation model than those that have information on age-specific deaths in 2020 for the excess analysis; this is because some countries' CRVS data may not meet data completeness thresholds for inclusion in the model and some death data for use in the excess analysis did not have appropriate denominators for calculating rates or only had preliminary data for 2020.25 Furthermore, countries that rely on survey data to describe child mortality are unlikely to have 2020 data even if they have conducted a recent survey due to the retrospective nature of child mortality estimation from birth histories. Given the intense focus on mortality in the context of the pandemic, increased data sharing and availability will be crucial for adequately tracking child mortality related to COVID-19, if any.

In total, 5.0 million children under age 5, including 2.4 million newborns, along with 2.2 million children and youth aged 5 to 24 years - 43 per cent of whom are adolescents - died in 2020. This tragic and massive loss of life, most of which was due to preventable or treatable causes, is a stark reminder of the urgent need to end preventable deaths of children and young people. Based on the best available empirical evidence, representing more than 80 countries and areas, and acknowledging that estimates in this report differ from some models that predicted increased deaths in 2020 due to service disruptions or economic downturns, the UN IGME did not find significant excess mortality among children in 2020 and therefore makes no adjustment to its 2020 estimates. Still, these data have limitations in their representativeness, and the pandemic and resulting mortality profile could change substantially from what has been observed thus far. We must continue to collect data, where available, to monitor the mortality situation of children and youth. Even as child and youth mortality in 2020 continued to show a downward trend from years prior, the task of ending preventable child deaths remains unfinished. If current trends continue, 54 countries will not meet the SDG target on under- five mortality, more than 60 countries will miss the target on neonatal mortality and 43 million under- five deaths are projected to take place between 2021 and 2030. About half of these deaths will be newborns and more than half will take place in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, without urgent action, almost 21 million children, adolescents and youth aged 5-24 years are projected to die before 2030. In contrast, if every country met the SDG target on under-five mortality, 8 million under-five deaths could be averted between 2021 and 2030. However, achieving the target in all countries is hindered by large and persistent regional and income class disparities in mortality. If current trends continue, 58 per cent of the projected 43 million under-five deaths before 2030 will take place in sub-Saharan Africa and another 24 per cent will occur in Southern Asia. Close to 75 per cent of the countries at risk of missing the SDG under-five mortality target are in sub-Saharan Africa and 85 per cent are low- or lower-middle income countries. Likewise, more than 80 per cent of the total under-five deaths in 2020 occurred in just two regions: sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. If the world is to address the still substantial annual child death burden, it must target action and attention to the most vulnerable regions, countries and ages. Though sub-Saharan Africa was not as hard hit as some other regions in terms of COVID-19-related mortality in 2020, the region's doggedly high mortality rates and future demographics call for increased focus on this region. Coupled with an increase in births and the under-five population in sub-Saharan Africa - a projected 408 million births are expected to take place between 2021 and 2030 and the under- five population is projected to increase by 17 per cent, to about 199 million, by 2030 - persistently high neonatal mortality rates across the region could lead to further stagnation or even increases in the number of neonatal deaths. The neonatal period is the riskiest time for a child's survival, and globally, as the level of under-five mortality falls, a greater share of all under-five deaths is taking place during the neonatal period, calling for increased attention to this period of life and urgent action to prevent newborn deaths. Addressing sub-Saharan Africa's demographic changes and pressing neonatal mortality will require strengthening and investing in health 26systems to improve the coverage and equity of care in delivering high-quality and high- impact maternal, newborn and child survival interventions. It will also require investment and expansion of the data collection systems required to monitor mortality in the future. As mentioned, data to assess excess mortality in 2020 are limited in age-disaggregation and geographic representativeness, and just about one fifth of the 195 countries covered in this report had high- quality under-five mortality data for 2020 available at the time these estimates were generated. Moreover, in the places where estimated mortality rates are highest, data tend to be most outdated - in sub-Saharan Africa, the most recent data point on child mortality was more than five years old in over half the countries in the region. These data gaps present serious challenges to timely and accurate estimation and monitoring of child mortality. The world is urgently engaged in limiting the mortality impact of the COVID-19 virus - this same focus must be applied to avert the millions of equally tragic child and adolescent deaths from all other causes that are projected to take place in the coming years, if we maintain the status quo. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced businesses, organizations and individuals to leave behind pre-pandemic mindsets and reevaluate ways of working to develop new methods that increase effectiveness. It is also time to leave behind the pre-COVID complacency around child mortality and recommit to every child's right to survive. With proper attention and action, ending preventable child deaths is still possible. Country consultation In accordance with the decision by the Statistical Commission and the United Nations Economic and Social Council resolution 2006/6, UN IGME child mortality estimates, which are used for the compilation of global indicators for SDG monitoring, are produced in consultation with countries.26 UNICEF and the WHO undertook joint country consultations in 2021. The country consultation process gave each country's ministry of health, national statistics office or relevant agency the opportunity to review all data inputs, the estimation methodology, and the draft estimates for under-five mortality and mortality among children and young adolescents aged 5-14 years and youth aged 15-24 years. The objective was to identify relevant data that were not included in the UN IGME database and to allow countries to review and provide feedback on estimates. In 2021, 102 of 195 countries sent comments or additional data. After the consultations, the UN IGME draft estimates for mortality in children under age 5 were revised for 95 countries using new or updated data, and the estimates for mortality in children and young adolescents aged 5-14 years or in youth aged 15-24 years were revised for 100 countries, given new or updated data. All countries were informed about changes in their estimates. 27 Estimating child mortality This chapter summarizes the methods the UN IGME uses to generate mortality estimates for children under age 5, older children and young adolescents aged 5-14 years, and older adolescents and youth aged 15-24 years. The UN IGME updates its estimates of neonatal, infant, under-five mortality and mortality among children aged 5-14 years and mortality among youth aged 15-24 years annually after reviewing newly available data and assessing their quality. These estimates are widely used in UNICEF's flagship publications, the United Nations Secretary-General's annual SDG report, and publications by other United Nations agencies, governments and donors. The UN IGME, which includes members from UNICEF, WHO, the World Bank Group and United Nations Population Division, was established in 2004 to advance the work on monitoring progress towards the achievement of child survival goals. Its Technical Advisory Group (TAG), comprising leading academic scholars and independent experts in demography and biostatistics, provides guidance on estimation methods, technical issues, and strategies for data analysis and data quality assessment. Overview The UN IGME employs the following broad strategy (Figure 9) to arrive at annual estimates of child mortality: 1. Compile and assess the quality of all available nationally representative data relevant to the estimation of child mortality, including data from vital registration systems, population censuses, household surveys and sample registration systems; 2. Recalculate data inputs and make adjustments as needed by applying standard methods; FIGURE 9UN IGME estimation strategy COMPILE Compile and assess the quality of all available nationally representative data relevant the estimationPROCESS Recalculate data inputs and make data adjustments if needed Recalculate indicators Calculate standard errors Pooled intervals for small populations Vital RegistrationUnder-five mortality Infant mortality Neonatal mortality Mortality among children aged 5-14 Mortality among youth aged 15-24Sample Vital Registration Population SBH, HH, SSH) Calculate standard errors Optimize intervals Adjust for HIV/AIDS- related bias in survey data collectionMODEL Fit a statistical model to the data to generate a smooth trend curve that averages over the different data sources for a country EXTRAPOLATE Extrapolate the model output to a target year and apply post-estimation adjustments Extrapolate Adjustments for HIV/AIDS and crisis UN IGME mortality estimates with uncertaintyOUTPUT Calculate number of deaths and publish estimates Calculate number of deaths using UN IGME mortality estimates and annual live births and population UN IGME report CME Info SDG database/ SDG report Others COUNTRY CONSULTATION Annual country consultation process to solicit feedback on UN IGME underlying data and methods: Revision of estimates based on new data from country consultation Note: FBH refers to full birth histories; SBH refers to summary birth histories; HH refers to household deaths; SSH refers to sibling survival history. 283. Fit a statistical model to these data to generate a smooth trend curve that averages possibly disparate estimates from the different data sources for a country; and 4. Extrapolate the model to a target year (in this case, 2020). To increase the transparency of the estimation process, the UN IGME has developed a child mortality web portal, Child Mortality Estimation (CME) Info, available at <childmortality.org>. It includes all available data and shows estimates for each country as well as which data are currently officially used by the UN IGME. Once new estimates are finalized, CME Info is updated accordingly. The UN IGME applies a common methodology across countries and uses empirical data from each country to produce comparable estimates, i.e., country values for the same reference year produced using a common method. Applying a consistent methodology allows for comparisons between countries, despite the varied number and types of data sources. UN IGME estimates are based on nationally available data from censuses, surveys or vital registration systems. The UN IGME does not use covariates to derive its estimates, but, rather, applies a curve-fitting method to empirical data after data quality assessment. Countries may use a single data source for their official estimates or apply valid methods different from those used by the UN IGME. The UN IGME does not report figures produced by individual countries using other methods, as these estimates would not be comparable across countries. The differences between UN IGME and national official estimates are usually not large if the empirical data are of good quality. The UN IGME aims to minimize errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time, and produce up-to- date and comparable estimates of child mortality. Because errors are inevitable in data, there will always be uncertainty around data and estimates. To allow for added comparability, the UN IGME generates all child mortality estimates with uncertainty bounds. Data sources Nationally representative estimates of under-five mortality can be derived from several different sources, including civil registration and sample surveys. Demographic surveillance sites and hospital data are excluded as they are not nationally representative. The preferred source of data is a civil registration system that records births and deaths on a continuous basis. If registration is complete and this system functions efficiently, the resulting estimates will be accurate and timely. However, many low- and middle- income countries do not have well-functioning vital registration systems. Therefore, household surveys such as the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, the USAID-supported Demographic and Health Surveys, and periodic population censuses have become the primary sources of data on mortality among children under age 5 and children, adolescents and youth aged 5-24 years. These surveys ask women about the survival of their children and about the survival of their siblings, and it is these reports (or microdata upon availability) that provide the basis for childhood, adolescent and youth mortality estimates for a majority of low- and middle- income countries. The first step in the process of arriving at estimates of levels and recent trends of child mortality is to compile all newly available data and add the data to the UN IGME database. Newly available data will include recently released vital statistics from a civil registration system, results from recent censuses and household surveys and, occasionally, results from older censuses or surveys not previously available. The full set of empirical data used in this analysis is publicly available from the UN IGME web portal, CME Info <childmortality.org>. In this round of estimation, a substantial amount of newly available data has been added to the underlying database for under-five, infant and neonatal mortality. Data from 96 new surveys or censuses were added for 55 countries and new years of data from vital registration systems or sample vital registration systems were added for 81 countries. In total, more than 4,600 country- year data points from about 180 series were added or updated. The database, as of December 2021, 29contains over 21,900 country-year data points from more than 1,600 series across 195 countries from 1990 (or earlier, back to 1911) to 2020. The databases for mortality among children aged 5-14 years and for mortality among children aged 15-24 years each contain more than 7,900 data points. The increased empirical data have substantially changed UN IGME estimates for some countries from previous editions, partly because the fitted trend line is based on the entire time series of data available for each country. The estimates presented in this report may differ from and are not necessarily comparable with previous sets of UN IGME estimates or the most recent underlying country data. Whatever the method used to derive the estimates, data quality is critical. The UN IGME assesses data quality and does not include data sources with substantial non-sampling errors or omissions as underlying empirical data in its statistical model. Civil registration data Data from civil registration systems are the preferred data source for child mortality estimation. The calculation of under-five mortality rates (U5MR, the probability of dying between birth and exactly 5 years of age, expressed per 1,000 live births), infant mortality rates (IMR, the probability of dying between birth and exactly one year of age, expressed per 1,000 live births), mortality rates among children aged 5-14 years (the probability a five-year-old would die before reaching age 15, expressed per 1,000 children aged 5 years) and mortality rates among youth aged 15-24 years (the probability a 15-year- old would die before reaching age 25, expressed per 1,000 youths aged 15 years) are derived from a standard period abridged life table using the age-specific deaths and midyear population counts from civil registration data. The neonatal mortality rate (NMR, the probability of dying between birth and exactly 28 days of age, expressed per 1,000 live births) is calculated with the number of deaths of infants under 28 days of age and the number of live births in a given year. For civil registration data (with available data on the number of deaths and mid-year populations), annual observations were initially constructed for all observation years in a country. For country- years in which the coefficient of variation exceeded 10 per cent for children under 5 years or 20 per cent for children aged 5-14 years, deaths and midyear populations were pooled over longer periods. Starting from the most recent years, deaths and population were combined with adjacent previous years to reduce spurious fluctuations in countries where small numbers of births and deaths were observed. The coefficient of variation is defined to be the stochastic standard error of 5q0 (5q0 = U5MR/1,000) or 1q0 (1q0 = IMR/1,000) observation divided by the value of the 5q0 or 1q0 observation. The stochastic standard error of the observation is calculated with a Poisson approximation using live birth numbers, given by sqrt(5q0/lb) or similarly sqrt(1q0/lb), where lb is the number of live births in the year of the observation.27 After this recalculation of the civil registration data, the standard errors are set to a minimum of 2.5 per cent for input into the model. A similar approach was used for neonatal mortality and mortality among children and youth aged 5-24 years. To select country-years for which vital registration data are included for older children, adolescents and youth aged 5-24 years and to compute adjustment factors in case of incomplete registration, a hybrid of the generalized growth balance method (GGB) and the synthetic extinct generation method (SEG), the GGBSEG method was used. The GGBSEG method is one of several demographic methods known as \"death distribution methods\"28 and has been shown to perform better than the GGB and SEG methods in isolation. The GGBSEG method is implemented in the DDM package of the R statistical software.29 Completeness was estimated for each country for periods between pairs of recent censuses for which an age distribution of the population was available in the Demographic Yearbook.30 The sex-specific completeness estimates were combined to obtain an estimate for both sexes. When the estimated completeness was less than 80 per cent, mortality rates derived from vital registration data were excluded from the model fit. When completeness was greater than or equal to 95 per cent, the registration was 30considered virtually complete and no adjustment was used to adjust mortality estimates upwards. If completeness was between 80 and 95 per cent, the inverse of the completeness rate was multiplied by the number of deaths to obtain adjusted estimates. These adjustments are only applied to mortality data above age 5 as the death distribution methods cannot be applied to estimate completeness of registration of under-five deaths. Survey data The majority of survey data on child mortality comes in one of two forms: the full birth history (FBH), whereby women are asked for the date of birth of each of their children, whether the child is still alive, and if not, the child's age at death; and the summary birth history (SBH), whereby women are asked only about the number of children ever born to them and the number who have died (or equivalently, the number still alive). FBH data, collected by all Demographic and Health Surveys and increasingly, by Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys and other nationally representative surveys, allow for the calculation of child mortality indicators for specific time periods in the past. This enables these survey programmes to publish under-five child mortality estimates for three 5-year periods before the survey; that is, 0 to 4, 5 to 9, and 10 to 14.31, 32, 33 The UN IGME has recalculated estimates to refer to calendar year periods using single calendar years for periods shortly before the survey and gradually increasing the number of years for periods further in the past, whenever microdata from the survey are available. The cut-off points of a given survey for shifting from estimates for single calendar years to two years, or two years to three, etc., are based on the coefficients of variation of the estimates.34 Mortality estimates of children aged 5-14 years can also be derived from the FBH module, but the probability of dying among children in this age group (10q5) is estimated for the period 0-12 years before the survey and divided into periods according to the coefficient of variation of the estimates (< 20 per cent). In general, SBH data collected by censuses and many household surveys use the woman's age as an indicator of the age of her children and their exposure time to the risk of dying, and employ models to estimate mortality indicators for periods in the past for women ages 25 to 29 through ages 45 to 49. This method is well known but has several shortcomings. Starting with the 2014 round of estimation, the UN IGME changed the method of estimation for SBHs to one based on classification of women by the time that had passed since their first birth. This method has several benefits over the previous one. Firstly, it generally has lower sampling errors and, secondly, it avoids the problematic assumption that the mortality estimates derived for each age group of women adequately represent the mortality of the whole population. As a result, it has less susceptibility to the selection effect of young women who give birth early, since all women who give birth necessarily must have a first birth and therefore, are not selected for. Thirdly, the method tends to show less fluctuation across time, particularly in countries with relatively low fertility and mortality. The UN IGME considers the improvements in estimates based on time since first birth worthwhile when compared to the estimates derived from the classification by age of mother. Hence, in cases where the microdata are available, the UN IGME has reanalysed the data using the new method. Due to known biases in the estimation for the 0-4 year period by time since first birth and for the 15-19 and 20-24 age groups of women, these data points are excluded in the estimation model. Moreover, following advice from UN IGME's TAG, child mortality estimates from SBH were not included if estimates from FBH in the same survey were available.35 SBH data are not used to derive neonatal mortality or mortality among children aged 5-14 years. Mortality estimates of youth aged 15-24 years were derived from the sibling survival histories (SSH). In SSH, women aged 15-49 years are asked to list all their siblings born to the same mother by birth order and to report on each sibling's gender, survival status, current age, if alive, or age at death and years since death, if deceased. Sibling histories have been extensively used to model adult mortality in countries lacking vital registration and to monitor trends in maternal 31mortality.36, 37,38 SSH were used to estimate the probability of a 15-year-old dying before reaching age 25 (10q15) for a period of 0-12 years prior to each survey. This period was divided in intervals of various length (6, 4, 3, 2, 1 years) depending on the coefficient of the variation of the estimates. Adjustment for missing mothers in high-HIV settings In populations severely affected by HIV/AIDS, HIV-positive children will be more likely to die than other children and will also be less likely to be reported since their mothers will also have been more likely to die. Child mortality estimates will thus be biased downwards. The magnitude of the bias will depend on the extent to which the elevated under-five mortality of HIV-positive children is not reported because of the deaths of their mothers. The TAG developed a method to adjust HIV/AIDS-related mortality for each survey data observation from FBH during HIV/ AIDS epidemics (1980-present) by adopting a set of simplified but reasonable assumptions about the distribution of births to HIV-positive women, primarily relating to the duration of their infection, vertical transmission rates, and survival times of both mothers and children from the time of the birth.39 This method was applied to all direct estimates from FBHs. The model was improved to incorporate the impact of antiretroviral therapies (ART) and prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT).40 No adjustment was included for HIV-related biases in the age group 5-14, since no method currently exists to estimate the magnitude of this bias in the probability 10q5. For mortality at ages 15-24, the vertical transmission of the virus is unlikely to introduce biases in the estimates, as mortality rates relate to the survival of the siblings of adult respondents. Systematic and random measurement error Data from these different sources require varied calculation methods and may suffer from different errors, such as random errors in sample surveys or systematic errors due to misreporting. Thus, different surveys often yield widely divergent estimates of U5MR for a given time period, as illustrated in Figure 10. In order to reconcile these differences and take better account of the systematic biases associated with the various types of data inputs, the TAG developed an estimation method to fit a smoothed trend curve to a set of observations and to FIGURE Empirical child mortality data in Nigeria and Papua New Guinea Note: All data available for the country are shown as coloured points, with observations from the same data series joined by lines, and each colour identifying different data sources.

Grey bands represent the standard errors of the observations where available or applicable. 10 32extrapolate that trend to a defined time point, in this case, 2020. This method is described in the following section. Estimation of under-five mortality rates Estimation and projection of under-five mortality rates was undertaken using the Bayesian B-splines bias-adjusted model, referred to as the B3 model. This model was developed, validated and used to produce previous rounds of UN IGME child mortality estimates, including the previously published round in 2020.41, 42 In the B3 model, log(U5MR) is estimated with a flexible splines regression model. The spline regression model is fitted to all U5MR observations in the country. An observed value for U5MR is considered to be the true value for U5MR multiplied by an error multiplier, i.e., observed U5MR = true U5MR * error multiplier, or on the log scale, log(observed U5MR) = log(true U5MR) + log(error multiplier). The error multiplier refers to the relative difference between an observation and the truth with error multiplier equal to 1 (and log(error multiplier) equal to zero) meaning no error. While estimating the true U5MR, properties of the errors that provide information about the quality of the observation or in other words, the extent of error that we expect, are taken into account. These properties include: the standard error of the observation; its source type (e.g., Demographic and Health Surveys versus census); and whether the observation is part of a data series from a specific survey (and how far the data series is from other series with overlapping observation periods). These properties are summarized in the data model. When estimating the U5MR, the data model adjusts for errors in observations, including the average systematic biases associated with different types of data sources, using information on data quality for different source types from all countries. Figure 11 displays the U5MR data and B3 model fit over time for Senegal, used here for illustrative purposes. Compared with the previously applied LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) FIGURE Empirical under-five mortality data and estimates from the B3 model for Senegal Note: The B3 estimates are in red. Ninety per cent uncertainty intervals for the U5MR are given by the pink shaded area. All data available for the country are shown as coloured points, with observations from the same data series joined by lines. Solid circles and lines represent data series/observations that were included for curve-fitting. Unfilled circles and dash lines represent data series/ observations that were excluded. Grey bands represent the standard errors of the observations where available or applicable.11 estimation approach,43 the B3 model better accounts for data errors, including biases and sampling and non-sampling errors in the data. It can more accurately capture short-term fluctuations in the U5MR and its annual rate of reduction and, thus, is better able to account for evidence of acceleration in the decline of under-five mortality from new surveys. Validation exercises show that the B3 model also performs better in short-term projections.27 The B3 method was developed and implemented for the UN IGME by Leontine Alkema and Jin Rou New with guidance and review by the UN IGME's TAG. A more complete technical description of the B3 model is available elsewhere.27, 42 Estimation of infant mortality rates In general, the B3 model described above is applied to the U5MR for all countries (except the Democratic People's Republic of Korea where a non-standard method was employed). For countries with high-quality vital registration data (covering a sufficient period of time and deemed to have high levels of completeness and coverage), the B3 model is also used to estimate the IMR but is fitted to the logit transform of 33r, i.e., log( r/1-r) where r is the ratio of the IMR estimate to the median B3 estimate of U5MR in the corresponding country-year. This is to restrict the IMR estimate to be lower than the U5MR estimate for any given year. For the remaining countries, the IMR is derived from the U5MR through the use of model life tables that contain known regularities in age patterns of child mortality.44 The advantage of this approach is that it avoids potential problems with the underreporting of neonatal deaths in some countries and ensures that the internal relationships of the three indicators are consistent with established norms. For countries in the Sahel region of Africa (Burkina Faso, Chad, the Gambia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Senegal) the relationship from model life tables does not apply between infant and child mortality, thus a logit transform of the ratio of IMR/U5MR is used to estimate IMR from U5MR using data from FBHs and a multilevel regression with country- specific intercept. Adjustment for rapidly changing child mortality driven by HIV/AIDS To capture the extraordinarily rapid changes in child mortality driven by HIV/AIDS over the epidemic period in some countries, the regression models were fitted to data points for the U5MR from all causes other than HIV/AIDS. UNAIDS estimates of HIV/AIDS under-five mortality were then added to estimates from the regression model. This method was used for 17 countries where the HIV prevalence rate exceeded 5 per cent at any point in time since 1980. Steps were as follows: 1. Compile and assess the quality of all newly available nationally representative data relevant to the estimation of child mortality; 2. Adjust survey data to account for possible biases in data collection and in HIV/AIDS epidemic; 3. Use UNAIDS estimates of HIV/AIDS child mortality45 to adjust the data points from 1980 onwards to exclude HIV/AIDS deaths; 4. Fit the standard statistical model to the observations to HIV-free data points; 5. Extrapolate the model to the target year; in this case 2020; 6. Add back estimates of deaths due to HIV/AIDS (from UNAIDS); and 7. Derive a non-AIDS curve of IMR from the estimated U5MR using model life tables; add the UNAIDS estimates of HIV/AIDS deaths for children under age 1 to generate the final IMR estimates. Estimation of under-five and infant mortality rates by sex In 2012, the UN IGME produced estimates of U5MR for males and females separately for the first time.46 In many countries, fewer sources have provided data by sex than for both sexes combined. For this reason, the UN IGME, rather than estimate U5MR trends by sex directly from reported mortality levels by sex, uses the available data by sex to estimate a time trend in the sex ratio (male/female ratio) of U5MR instead. Bayesian methods for the UN IGME estimation of sex ratios, with a focus on the estimation and identification of countries with outlying levels or trends, were used. A more complete technical description of the model is available elsewhere.47 Estimation of neonatal mortality rates The NMR is defined as the the probability of dying between birth and exactly 28 days of age, expressed per 1,000 live births. In 2015, the UN IGME method for estimating NMR was updated to a Bayesian methodology similar to that used to estimate U5MR and derive estimates by sex. It has the advantage that, compared to the previous model, it can capture data-driven trends in NMR within countries and over time, for all countries. A more complete technical description of the model is available elsewhere.48 For neonatal mortality in HIV-affected and crisis-affected populations, the ratio is estimated initially for non-AIDS and non-crisis mortality. After estimation, crisis neonatal deaths are added back on to the neonatal deaths to compute the total estimated neonatal mortality rate. No AIDS deaths are added to the NMR, thereby assuming these deaths only affect child mortality after the first month of life. 34Estimation of mortality rates among children aged 5-14 years and youth aged 15-24 years Since 2017, the UN IGME has generated country- specific trend estimates of the mortality in children aged 5-14 years - that is, the probability a five-year-old would die before reaching age 15 (10q5). Since 2020, the UN IGME has also generated estimates of the mortality in youth aged 15-24 years - that is, the probability a 15-year-old would die before reaching age 25 (10q15). The methods used are similar to those used to estimate the U5MR. The B3 statistical model was applied to the 5-14 and 15-24 age groups separately and used to obtain smooth trend curves in the probability of a five-year-old dying before age 15 (10q5) and the probability of a 15-year-old dying before age 25 (10q15). There were not enough data inputs from vital registration, surveys or censuses to estimate the probability 10q5 in 30 countries and 10q15 in 36 countries. For these cases, the probability, 10q5 or 10q15 was modelled on the draft estimates of U5MR and an expected relationship between mortality in the 0-4 and 5-14 or 15-24 age groups, as observed in countries with sufficient data series. A hierarchical linear regression was used to regress log(10q5) or log(10q15) against log(U5MR) and the coefficients of this regression were used to predict the probability 10q5 and 10q15 between 1990 and 2020 for countries with insufficient data sources. The advantage of this approach is that no model life tables are used (such life tables are based on the historical experience of countries with high- quality vital registration data and do not always adequately reflect mortality age patterns in low- and middle-income countries). A more complete technical description of the model is available elsewhere.49 It is worth noting that for all non-vital registration data series, non-sampling biases specific to data series are estimated with the B3 model. We observed that full birth histories from surveys tend to slightly underestimate mortality in the age group 5-14 when compared to other data series. Sibling histories used to model the probability 10q15 also tend to underestimate mortality in the age group 15-24, especially for reference periods that are located further in the past from the survey date. This is likely due to omissions of some deaths or systematic age misstatements. As a result, in countries where the trend in mortality is largely informed by survey data, the final estimates are adjusted upwards and therefore, the final estimated series may fall slightly above the original survey data points. Estimation of child mortality due to conflict and natural disasters Estimated deaths from major crises were derived from various data sources from 1950 to the present. Data on natural disasters were obtained from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters' International Disaster Database.50 Conflict death data were taken from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program/ Peace Research Institute Oslo datasets,51, 52 Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project53 Center for Systemic Peace/Integrated Network for Societal Conflict Research dataset,54 as well as from reports prepared by the UN and other organizations. Estimated child and youth deaths due to major crises were included if they met the following criteria: (1) the crisis was isolated to a few years; (2) under-five crisis deaths, crisis deaths among children aged 5-14 years or crisis deaths among youth aged 15-24 years were greater than 10 per cent of non-crisis deaths in the age group; (3) crisis U5MR, crisis 10q5 or crisis 10q15 was > 0.2 deaths per 1,000; (4) the number of crisis deaths among children under 5 years, or among those 5-14 or 15-24 years old was > 10 deaths. These criteria resulted in 43 different crises for 32 countries being explicitly incorporated into UN IGME estimates for under-five mortality, 67 different crises for 53 countries being incorporated into the mortality estimates among children aged 5-14 years, and 69 different crises for 48 countries being incorporated into the mortality estimates among children aged 15-24 years. Because background mortality rates were relatively low in the older age groups, crisis deaths represented a larger share of deaths and thus, more crises met the criteria for inclusion than for under-five mortality. Crisis deaths were included in the estimates by first excluding data points from crisis years, then fitting the B3 model to the remaining data and adding the crisis- specific mortality rate to the fitted B3 curve. Crisis death estimates are uncertain but, presently, no uncertainty around crisis deaths is included in the uncertainty intervals of the estimates. Instead, we assume the relative uncertainty in the adjusted 35estimates is equal to the relative uncertainty in the non-adjusted estimates; this assumption will be revisited in the near future. The UN IGME has assessed recent humanitarian crises and, based on the scarcity of currently available data and the difficulties of estimating the broader impact of these crises on health systems, decided to hold the estimates constant from the start of the crisis while increasing the uncertainty over the crisis time for three countries: South Sudan, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and Yemen. Where applicable, direct crisis deaths have been added to the constant trend estimate. The UN IGME will review new data, if available, in the next estimation round and revise estimates accordingly. Estimation of uncertainty intervals Given the inherent uncertainty in child mortality estimates, 90 per cent uncertainty intervals are used by the UN IGME instead of the more conventional 95 per cent intervals. Reporting intervals based on higher levels of uncertainty (i.e., 95 per cent instead of 90 per cent) has the advantage that the chance of not having included the true value in the interval is smaller. The disadvantage of choosing higher uncertainty levels, however, is that intervals lose their utility to present meaningful summaries of a range of likely outcomes if the indicator of interest is highly uncertain. Given this trade-off and the substantial uncertainty associated with child mortality estimates, the UN IGME chose to report 90 per cent uncertainty intervals or in other words, intervals for which there is a 90 per cent chance that they contain the true value, to encourage wider use and interpretation of uncertainty intervals. Extrapolation to common reference year If the underlying empirical data refer to an earlier reference period than the end year of the period the estimates are reported, the UN IGME extrapolates the estimates to the common end year; in this round, to 2020. The UN IGME does not use covariates to derive the estimates but uses the past trend in a country and the global trend to extrapolate to the target year. The average extrapolation period in the 2021 round of estimation was 4.8 years for under-five mortality with half of the countries having data points within the past 3.5 years. Calculating number of deaths Under-five, infant and neonatal deaths A birth-week cohort method is used to calculate the absolute number of deaths among neonates, infants and children under age 5. First, each annual birth cohort is divided into 52 equal birth-week cohorts. Then each birth-week cohort is exposed throughout the first five years of life to the appropriate calendar year- and age-specific mortality rates depending on cohort age. For example, the 20th birth-week cohort of the year 2000 will be exposed to the infant mortality rates in both 2000 and 2001. All deaths from birth- week cohorts occurring as a result of exposure to the mortality rate for a given calendar year are allocated to that year and are summed by age group at death to get the total number of deaths for a given year and age group. Continuing with the above example, deaths from the 20th birth- week cohort of the year 2000 would contribute to infant deaths in year 2000 and 2001. Any deaths occurring among the 20th birth-week cohort of year 2000 after the 20th week in 2001 would contribute to under-five deaths for year 2001 and so forth. Under-five deaths in each calendar year are calculated by summing up all the deaths under age 5 across all age group cohorts in that year. The annual estimate of the number of live births in each country from the World Population Prospects 201913 is used to calculate the number of deaths. Deaths among children aged 5-14 years and youth aged 15-24 The absolute number of deaths among those aged 5-14 years in a given year and country is calculated using the central death rates of age groups 5-9 and 10-14 years, 5M5 and 5M10, computed from the estimated 5q5 and 5q10. The central death rates are then multiplied by the country population estimates for the respective age groups from the World Population Prospects 201913 to calculate the number of deaths. A similar approach is used for calculating the number of deaths in the age group 15-24: the estimated 5q15 and 5q20 are converted in central death rates 5M15 and 5M20 and multiplied by the population estimates. COVID-19 The 2021 UN IGME estimates do not include any adjustment in the year 2020 for COVID-19- related mortality as the evidence is insufficient to 36support an adjustment at this time. First, direct COVID-19 deaths in the age groups estimated in this report are rare, and thus unlikely to impact national-level estimates. Second, while some scenario-based projections have suggested a large number of additional under-five deaths could result indirectly from extended pandemic-related disruption to critical care and interventions, a UN IGME analysis of excess mortality using empirical data on deaths in 2020 from more than 80 countries and areas (more than 70 countries or areas had vital registration data available for this analysis and 11 countries had data from their Health Management Information System (HMIS) available for excess mortality analysis, along with data from the COMSA system in Mozambique) found no evidence of systematic excess mortality among children or youth in 2020 - perhaps reflecting recent reports suggesting an earlier and more robust rebound than anticipated in the provision of some of these interventions or protective effects of pandemic mitigation measures like social distancing, handwashing and masking. Excess mortality analysis for 2020 For the analysis of excess mortality from vital registration data in 2020, death counts for 72 countries or area by age group and year between 2015 and 2020 are retrieved from various sources including the WHO, UN Population Division, Population Division of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CELADE), Eurostat,55 the Short- Term Mortality Fluctuations Data series (STMF),56 Human Mortality Database (HMD),57 country- specific statistical offices and ministries of health offices, and country-consultation data reported directly to UNICEF. Death counts are grouped in ages 0, 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19 and 20-24, where this configuration was possible. Data on infant mortality (<1 year) was available in 52 countries. In the 20 populations where data configuration does not allow for estimates of infant mortality, child mortality is analysed for the full age interval 0-4. For the 72 populations under analysis during the period 2015-2020, 5,435,802 deaths among children and youth aged younger than 24 years were included. Of these deaths, 900,263 occurred in 2020. Excess mortality in 2020 is defined as the difference between the observed and expected all-cause mortality (also denoted as the baseline mortality) in 2020. The baseline mortality is obtained by fitting a Generalized Linear Model with quasi-Poisson distribution to observed mortality between 2015 and 2019 in each age group and sex. The model is defined as: where and indicate, respectively, the death counts and population at risk for each age group x , sex s , and country c , during years t (between years 2015 and 2019), 0 accounts for the intercept and t for the secular change in mortality (as an exponential trend). Confidence intervals, 95 per cent, were predicted after obtaining robust standard errors. For exposure, population estimates by single year of age and period, between 2015 and 2020, were obtained from the World Population Prospects projection. In order to account for variations in fertility during the pandemic, data on population counts were complemented with annual births counts where this information was available. Fertility data are retrieved from the Short-Term Fertility Fluctuations Data series (STFF)58 and statistical offices. In total, annual birth counts were included in 59 countries. In order to be able to compare the excess magnitudes between populations, p-scores, which are estimated as the ratio of the baseline to the observed mortality ( ), were computed for each age and sex. HMIS data were analysed for 11 countries (Bangladesh, Burundi, Eswatini, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe), along with COMSA data for Mozambique. Trends and excess 2020 deaths were analysed for neonatal, infant and under- five age groups (where available -not all data had sufficient age disaggregation for analysis of all these age groups) from these data. Given the time span and granularity of available HMIS data, monthly observations were analysed to include additional data points for the prediction of baselines. The baseline for neonatal mortality was obtained by fitting a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) with quasi-Poisson distribution, which allows for the inclusion of non-linear terms to account for seasonality. The model is defined as:(!,#,$%)=&++(!,#,$%) !,#$ !,#$ !,#,$%$%& !,#,$%$%& + 37where and indicate, respectively, the death counts (either neonatal or fetal deaths) and exposure at risk, during month t . 0 accounts for the intercept, t for the secular change in mortality (as an exponential trend), and cps (mth) is a cyclical p-spline that accounts for seasonal variations. Confidence intervals, 95 per cent, were predicted using bootstrapping with 2,000 iterations. For the analysis of neonatal mortality rates, we use monthly live births as exposures. The monthly baseline of infant and child excess mortality were also obtained by fitting a GAM model with quasi-Poisson distribution, similar to the model employed for neonatal mortality. However, the model employed for infant and child mortality does not account for monthly variations in the exposure, as these data were not available in the HMIS data and it is not expected to vary considerably during the observation months. As with the vital registration analysis, the monthly observations were assessed to detect any significant deviations from the expected number of deaths based on historical data. Data from the Siaya Health and Demographic Surveillance Site in Kenya were also analysed in a similar manner to that described above and found no evidence of increased under-five or neonatal mortality in 2020. It should be noted that geographic and income variation in the data on excess deaths analysed by the UN IGME thus far is limited, and data collection continues to gather a more complete picture of COVID-19-related mortality among children and youth in 2020 and beyond. While these data do not support national-level adjustments for child mortality in 2020, the pandemic continues to evolve in unpredictable ways due to uneven vaccine rollouts, the emergence of more infectious variants and ongoing variation in pandemic response policy, among other factors. Thus, the UN IGME will continue to collect data for assessing excess deaths in 2020 and begin to assess excess mortality impact for 2021. The UN IGME will revisit this issue and generate adjustments where applicable and as needed based on evidence as it becomes available.$!,#,$%+=&++()+(!,#,$%) !,#$ !,#$ 38391.

The annual rate of reduction (ARR) from 2010-2020 is used to project mortality rates at the country level from 2021-2030, with the neonatal mortality rate constrained so as not to exceed the under-five mortality rate. If a country had a negative ARR in 2010-2020 (i.e., an increase in mortality rates in 2010-2020), the rate was held constant at the estimated 2020 value. If a country reached the current lowest observed mortality level among countries with more than 10,000 live Notes births during the projection period, the mortality rate was held constant at that lowest observed level for the remainder of the projection period. Regional aggregates were calculated based on the projected country- level estimates. Crisis mortality was removed from the estimates for the calculation of the ARR. 25. Four countries or areas included in the excess mortality analysis are not countries or areas that UN IGME produces child mortality estimates for. 26.

Note: Values in parentheses represent the 90 per cent uncertainty intervals. Estimates are generated by the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation to ensure comparability; they are not necessarily the official statistics of United Nations Member States, which may use alternative rigorous methods. a. Number of deaths are rounded to thousands. A zero indicates that the number of deaths is below 500. Unrounded number of deaths are available at <www.childmortality.org> for download. b. The UN IGME estimates are not necessarily the official statistics of the National Statistical Committee of the Republic of Belarus. c. The most recent national official estimates of under-five mortality rate in India are from the India Sample Registration System with a rate of 36 deaths per 1,000 live births in the year 2018. The most recent national official estimates of infant mortality rate in India are from the India Sample Registration System with a rate of 30 deaths per 1,000 live births in the year 2019. The most recent national official estimates of neonatal mortality rate in India are from the India Sample Registration System with a rate of 23 deaths per 1,000 live births in the year 2018. d. The mortality rates used as underlying data and shown as \"VR submitted to WHO/UNIGME 2020 version (VR)\" are calculated by UN IGME using standard methods with data from Rosstat. e. The most recent national official estimates of neonatal, infant and under-five mortality rates in Uzbekistan are from the vital registration system with a rate of 6, 9 and 12 deaths per 1,000 live births, respectively, in the year 2020. The most recent official estimates from the vital registration system for the probability of dying among children aged 5-14 is 2 deaths per 1,000 children aged 5 and the probability of dying among youths aged 15-24 is 6 deaths per 1,000 youths aged 15. f. The most recent national official estimates of neonatal, infant and under-five mortality rates in Zambia are from the 2018 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (2018 ZDHS) with a rate of 27, 42 and 61 deaths per 1,000 live births, respectively, in the 5-year period before the survey. g. The sum of the number of deaths by region may differ from the world total because of rounding. 6667Regional Classifications Sub-Saharan Africa Angola (LDC), Benin (LDC), Botswana (LLDC), Burkina Faso (LDC, LLDC), Burundi (LDC, Cabo Verde (SIDS), Cameroon, Central Comoros (LDC, SIDS), Congo, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo (LDC), Djibouti (LDC), Equatorial Guinea (LDC), Eritrea (LDC), Eswatini (LLDC), Ethiopia (LDC, LLDC), Gabon, Gambia (LDC), Ghana, Guinea (LDC), Guinea-Bissau (LDC, SIDS), Kenya, Lesotho (LDC, LLDC), Libe - ria (LDC), Madagascar (LDC), Malawi LLDC), Mali (LDC, LLDC), Mauritania (LDC), Mauritius (SIDS), Mozambique (LDC), Namibia, Niger (LDC, (LDC), Seychelles (SIDS), Sierra Leone Somalia (LDC), South Africa, South Sudan (LDC, LLDC), Togo (LDC), Uganda (LDC, LLDC), United Republic of Tanzania (LDC), Zambia (LDC, LLDC), Zimbabwe (LLDC) Northern Africa and Western Asia Northern Africa Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Sudan (LDC), Tunisia Western Asia Armenia (LLDC), Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Cyprus, Georgia, Iraq, Israel, Jor - dan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, State of Palestine, Syr - ian Arab Republic, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Yemen (LDC) Central and Southern Asia Central Asia Kazakhstan (LLDC), Kyrgyzstan (LLDC), Tajikistan (LLDC), Turkmeni - stan (LLDC), Uzbekistan Southern Asia Afghanistan (LDC, LLDC), Bangladesh (LDC), Bhutan (LLDC), India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Maldives (SIDS), Nepal (LDC, LLDC), Paki - stan, Sri Lanka Eastern and South-Eastern Asia Eastern Asia China, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Japan, Mongolia (LLDC), Republic of KoreaSouth-Eastern Asia Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia (LDC), Indonesia, Lao People's Demo - cratic Republic (LDC, LLDC), Malaysia, Myanmar (LDC), Philippines, Singapore (SIDS), Thailand, Timor-Leste (LDC, SIDS), Viet Nam Latin America and the Caribbean Antigua and Barbuda (SIDS), Argentina, Bahamas (SIDS), Barbados (SIDS), Belize (SIDS), Bolivia (Plurinational State of) (LLDC), Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba (SIDS), Dominica (SIDS), Dominican Republic (SIDS), Ecuador, El Salvador, Grenada (SIDS), Guatemala, Guy - ana (SIDS), Haiti (LDC, SIDS), Honduras, Jamaica (SIDS), Mexico, Nica - ragua, Panama, Paraguay (LLDC), Peru, Saint Kitts and Nevis (SIDS), Saint Lucia (SIDS), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (SIDS), Suriname (SIDS), Trinidad and Tobago (SIDS), Uruguay, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) Oceania Australia and New Zealand Australia, New Zealand Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) Cook Islands (SIDS), Fiji (SIDS), Kiribati (LDC, SIDS), Marshall Islands (SIDS), (SIDS), Papua New Islands (LDC, SIDS), Tonga (SIDS), Tuvalu (LDC, SIDS), Vanuatu (LDC, SIDS) Europe and Northern America Northern America Canada, United States of America Europe Albania, Andorra, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Moldova (LLDC), Romania, Russian Federation, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Republic of North Macedonia (LLDC), Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern IrelandThe regional classifications that are referred to in the report and for which aggregate data are provided in the statistical table are Sustainable Development Goal regions (see below).

The UN IGME is led by United Nations Children's Fund and includes the World Health Organization, the World Bank Group and the United Nations Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs as full members. The UN IGME's independent Technical Advisory Group, comprising leading academic scholars and independent experts in demography and biostatistics, provides technical guidance on estimation methods, technical issues and strategies for data analysis and data quality assessment. The UN IGME updates its child mortality estimates annually after reviewing newly available data and assessing data quality. This report contains the latest UN IGME estimates of child mortality at the country, regional and global levels. Country-specific estimates and the data used to derive them are available at <www.childmortality.org>.
