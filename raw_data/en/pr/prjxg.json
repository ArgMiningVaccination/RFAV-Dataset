This document lists frequently used terms in public health materials and their common, everyday alternatives in plain language sentences. Original sentence examples come from materials on CDC.gov . Some words and phrases may have multiple meanings, so check the context of use before you substitute. Remember, it might not be enough to delete jargon and substitute an everyday word in materials for the nonexpert public. You may have to rewrite the entire sentence or sentences and use multiple techniques. As a rule, you help readers when you: Write short sentences. Use active voice. Use everyday words and pronouns (when appropriate). Who should use this document? Federal employees and contractors writing for the nonexpert public: The Plain Writing Act says that federal agencies must use plain language in public communication. Anyone writing for an audience that will benefit from jargon-free language: Consider the intended audience, and use the language that will make the most sense to them. When you do need to reach a broad, public audience without specialized knowledge about a topic, everyday words are the most appropriate language to help the most people understand the information. Does this document include all medical and public health jargon? No, this document includes many but not all common public health terms used in materials on CDC.gov. For example, the document doesn't include specialized disease, health condition, anatomy, or physiology terms. We will periodically add relevant, widely-used terms and examples. Help improve this document with audience testing If you do audience testing of these terms or other public health or medical words, please send your results to the CDC Office of the Associate Director for Communication Science health literacy team at clearcommunication@cdc.gov . We want to use the results to update and share the list with others so they can learn which terms work better for different audiences.

(Note: Don't use \"e.g. \" or \"etc. \" because they are academic abbreviations. Use \"such as\" or \"for example\" instead. Also, \"e.g., \" means the list of examples cannot possibly include every item, and \"etc. \" would be redundant.) There are a lot of ways to get involved. Just educating yourself about disabilities or making sure that your organization provides accessible educational materials for people with disabilities can make a difference. Plain Language Sentences Make sure that people with disabilities can get to every part of your facility, such as the parking lot, exam tables in the patient rooms, and restrooms.

(Also see: Virus) CDC Original Sentences The bacteria known as Bacillus anthracis produce dormant spores (not active) that can live in the environment, like soil, for a long time, even decades. Contact with anthrax can cause severe illness in both humans and animals. Healthy people can carry the bacteria in their nose or throat without getting sick. Rarely, these bacteria can invade the body and cause disease. Most people who 'carry' the bacteria never become sick. Plain Language Sentences Anthrax germs can live in soil for decades.
