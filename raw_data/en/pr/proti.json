So if your dog's coughing, scroll down to the second part of this post to find natural herbal and homeopathic kennel cough remedies. But it's also important to know more about kennel cough and how it affects your dog. Here's what's in this article. - What Is Kennel Cough? - What Causes Kennel Cough? - Does The Kennel Cough Vaccine Prevent Kennel Cough? - What Are The Symptoms Of Kennel Cough? - How To Prevent Kennel Homeopathic Remedies For Kennel Cough What Is Kennel Cough? Kennel cough is an infectious bronchitis your dog can catch from other dogs. He can also pick it up from the environment if a sick dog has been around recently. Kennel cough is the dog version of the human common cold. So ... even though that hacking cough can sound nasty, it's not usually serious. Like a cold, it's normally a self-limiting disease. That means your dog will get over it on his own in time. But even so, it's better to avoid it altogether! So, knowing how to prevent and treat kennel cough really helps. Especially if your dog travels ... or is the sociable type who romps at the park with other dog friends. What Causes Kennel Cough? It's not surprising that kennel cough has a few other names. It can stem from several infections coming together at the same time. Depending on your dog's symptoms, your vet may use one name more than another. The main cause of kennel cough is a weakened immune system. When your dog's natural defenses are down, his body is more prone to infection. Kennel cough can often happen when two or more bacteria or viruses attack your dog's immune system at once. There's a lot of research to try and pinpoint the causes of infection. The more studies they do ... the more viruses and bacteria they find in kennel cough infections. The most frequent culprit in dogs with kennel cough is Bordetella bronchiseptica. But there's a long list of other sidekicks that also cause this mixed infection, including Canine parainfluenza virus(CAV-2) - Canine influenza virus (CIV) - Streptococcus - Canine Mycoplasma respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV ) - Canine pneumovirus (CnPnV) So you can see that it's tough to know just what bacteria or virus sick dogs are sharing. But it doesn't really matter ... because you can spot the symptoms early to help control kennel cough before it spreads. What Are The Symptoms Of Kennel Cough? Kennel cough often sounds like a harsh, hacking cough ... a bit like a cat coughing up a hairball. Your dog may only cough occasionally, or when he's excited. These aren't the only signs, though. Other possible symptoms include: - Sounding like something's stuck in his throat - Less interest in his food - Runny nose - Low energy or less interested in his usual activities - And in more severe cases, a fever There's more detail about treatment later. But with mild kennel cough, the main goal is to boost your dog's immune system. That'll help him get over it it faster ... and prevent it from worsening. Severe kennel cough can cause a fever ... and could even turn into pneumonia. Pneumonia can be painful and difficult to treat. If your dog has any other diseases or auto-immune health issues like the ones listed below, he'll be more likely to pick up an infection and develop kennel cough. - Leaky gut - Thyroid disease - Allergies - Kidney disease - Liver disease - Cancer So, you'll want to prevent kennel cough if you can. But what's the best way to do that? Most people you ask will recommend vaccination. But how effective is that? Does The Kennel Cough Vaccine Prevent Kennel Cough? Chances are ... your dog's daycare, trainer or boarding facility asks for proof of kennel cough (also known as Bordetella) vaccination ... ... but should you really be vaccinating your dog for kennel cough? And does the kennel cough vaccine really work? These facilities want all dogs vaccinated before they hang out together. That's because the risk of kennel cough infection is higher when dogs mingle. Just like when the kids first go back to school and share all their new germs with each other. But before you give your dog any vaccine, you should ask these questions: - Is the vaccine safe? - Is the vaccine effective? - Lastly, is the disease dangerous? So let's review these questions and find out if the kennel cough vaccine is really the best choice for your dog. Is The Kennel Cough Vaccine Safe? Most vaccines these days are modified live vaccines. That means they bring risks for your dog. Modified live vaccines contain bacteria or viruses that have been altered ... so that they don't cause clinical disease. But they do stimulate the immune response. The problem is ... modified live vaccines can also cause the disease they were meant to prevent. And research in humans shows they can embed themselves in the genes of the host. This happens with dogs too. It means the viruses can stay in your dog's body, then cause illness later ... sometimes even years later. Veterinarian Patricia Jordan DVM also reminds us that vaccination of any sort elevates histamines. When histamine levels are high they cause chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation can trigger other diseases (including cancer) as your dog ages. And do you know why your daycare or boarding facility asks you to vaccinate your dog at least a couple weeks before he visits? It's because your dog can shed the live bacteria and virus for a up to 7 weeks after vaccination ... ... So other dogs can catch kennel cough from your vaccinated dog ... even though your dog doesn't have the cough. Is The Kennel Cough Vaccine Effective? Unfortunately, the kennel cough vaccine is not very effective. It's the reason we don't have cold vaccines for people! It's also why vets recommend vaccinating for kennel cough 2 or 3 times a year. I mentioned earlier that kennel cough infections come from a mix of bacteria and viruses. But not all of these agents are included in the vaccines. There are about 40 agents that cause kennel cough ... but the vaccine only covers a few of them. And if the vaccine did include all of them .... it would make it even riskier. Your dog's immune system isn't built to handle so many stressors at once. So the vaccine makers had to choose the most common infection triggers and use those for vaccines. Some cause more harm than good. Currently most vets consider the intranasal kennel cough vaccines to be the most effective. But the problem goes back to that mixed infection aspect of kennel cough. The intranasal vaccines only contain canine parainfluenza and Bordetella bronchiseptica. This means the vaccine is ineffective. Here's what immunologist Ronald Schultz PhD said: \"Many animals receive \"kennel cough\" vaccines that include Bordetella and CPI and/or CAV-2 every 6 to 9 months without evidence that this frequency of vaccination is necessary or beneficial\" \"In contrast, other dogs are never vaccinated for kennel cough and disease is not seen. \"CPI immunity lasts at least 3 years when given intranasally, and CAV -2 immunity lasts a minimum of 7 years parenterally for CAV-I\" says Schultz. \"These two viruses in combination with Bordetella bronchiseptica are the agents most often associated with kennel cough, however, other factors play an important role in disease (eg stress, dust, humidity, molds, mycoplasma, etc), thus kennel cough is not a vaccine preventable disease because of the complex factors associated with this disease. \"Furthermore, this is often a mild to moderate self limiting disease. I refer to it as the 'Canine Cold.'\" concludes Schultz. So ... is vaccinating your dog worth the risk, with so little benefit? And that takes us to the last question. Is Kennel Cough So Dangerous That We Need To Vaccinate? You now know that it's the dog equivalent of a cold. It poses some extra risk to immune-compromised dogs. But it's not life threatening if you support your dog's immune system. There are ways to prevent and treat kennel cough naturally. So it's a good idea to say no to the vaccine. Here's a more natural, safer approach to preventing kennel cough. How To Prevent Kennel Cough Naturally Here are two safe and effective ways to help prevent kennel cough in your dog ...

Most homeopathic remedies are made from plants or minerals. But nosodes come from diseased tissue from a sick animal.They're diluted thousands of times to create a bioenergetic remedy ... that can interact with the body's energy field. Nosodes are an energetic blueprint of the actual disease ... but they don't contain any toxins or chemicals. This makes them a really safe alternative to vaccination. A Proven Way To Prevent Disease Dr Isaac Golden, an Australian homeopath, has done extensive research into homeopathic childhood immunizations. In a clinical trial of typical childhood diseases, Dr Golden concluded that homeopathic immunizations were 90.4% effective. Dr Christopher Day, a British veterinary homeopath, has used nosodes in his practice for 35 years. In 1985, Dr Day documented the successful use of nosodes in a kennel cough outbreak. The trial was done in a daycare with 214 dogs, both vaccinated and unvaccinated. The nosodes were given in the dogs' drinking water. Out of 214 dogs who got the kennel cough nosode, only 1.9% caught the full-blown disease. Most dogs who did get kennel cough had only minor symptoms. But the vaccinated dogs had worse results. 4.7% of them got kennel cough, compared to only 0.7% of the unvaccinated ones. So nosodes can be highly effective in preventing kennel cough. And when dogs do get sick, nosodes can reduce the severity of symptoms.
