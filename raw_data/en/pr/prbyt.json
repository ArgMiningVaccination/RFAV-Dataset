What are indigestion and heartburn? Indigestion and heartburn are symptoms that are very common in pregnancy. If you're pregnant, you have an 8 in 10 chance you will experience these symptoms at some point in your pregnancy. Indigestion, also called 'dyspepsia', is a feeling of pain or discomfort in your stomach . This mostly occurs after eating or drinking. Heartburn, also known as reflux, is a burning pain in your stomach or chest going up towards your throat. It's caused by stomach acid coming up your oesophagus (the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach). The acid irritates the lining of your oesophagus. Sometimes food might come back up from your stomach into your mouth. You might also notice a bitter taste in your mouth. Why might I get heartburn when I'm pregnant? Heartburn may be caused by changes in your hormone levels. One of the pregnancy hormones, called progesterone, can relax the muscle that usually holds your oesophagus closed where it meets your stomach. This allows food and acid from your stomach to go back up your oesophagus. Heartburn becomes more common as your pregnancy progresses. This can happen when your [uterus](/anatomy-of-pregnancy-and-birth-uterus) (womb) pushes up against your stomach as your baby grows. This also pushes the contents of your stomach up into your oesophagus. You're more likely to get heartburn during pregnancy if you've had a baby before or if you get heartburn when you're not pregnant. What kinds of things will give me heartburn?
