The program assists states, territories and federally-recognized tribal governments in providing gravesites for Veterans in those areas where VA's national cemeteries cannot fully satisfy their burial needs. Grants may be used only for the purpose of establishing, expanding or improving Veterans cemeteries that are owned and operated by a state, federally-recognized tribal government, or U.S. territory. Aid can be granted only to states, federally-recognized tribal governments, or U.S. territories [Rural Veterans Coordination Pilot](https://www.ruralhealth.va.gov/aboutus/ruralvets.asp) The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs created the Rural Veterans Coordination Pilot (RVCP) grant program to support Veterans and their families who reside in rural and/or underserved areas of the country. Grantees are expected to use the funds to aid Veterans with the transition to civilian life. [Grant and Per Diem Program](https://www.va.gov/homeless/gpd.asp) VA's Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program is offered annually (as funding permits) by the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) Programs to fund community agencies providing services to homeless Veterans.
