Describing the State's Current Status and Needs The Department recognizes the extraordinary efforts made by States, LEAs, and educators to support students during the COVID -19 pandemic. In this section, SEAs will describe the progress they have made, the priorities and student needs guiding their ARP ES SER funding decisions, and their current and projected operating status. 1. Progress and Promising Practices : Provide your assessment of the top 2 -3 strategies that have been most effective in supporting the needs of students in your State during the COVID -19 pandemic, especially for students most impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. Please include, if applicable, how your State will submit and encourage its LEAs to submit lessons learned and best practices to the Department's Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse so that they can be shared with other States and LEAs. Oregon Department of Education (ODE) is centered on a commitment to promoting educational systems that support every child's identity, health and well -being, beauty, and strengths. Students, families, and communities felt the impact of school closures and loss of access to normally relied -upon resources. As such, equity was not a standalone consideration but informed eve ry decision at both the state and local levels. Decisions, whether related to health, instruction, or operations, had the potential to exacerbate existing inequities -- disproportionately impacting those currently and historically marginalized by the educa tion system. Although equity considerations, key principles, and recommended actions were specifically addressed in the strategies referenced below, an equity -informed, anti -racist, and anti-oppressive lens weaves throughout all of the response strategies ODE implemented. In alignment with Oregon Department of Education's Education Equity Stance , ODE implemented the following three strategies: Pandemic Response Stra tegy 1: Issuance of Ready Schools, Safe Learners Guidance ODE worked jointly with the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance to issue the Ready Schools, Safe Learners (RSSL) Guidance in August 2020 (See Appendix E). The health and safety aspects of RSSL applied to all Oregon Local Education Agencies (LE As), public charter schools, and private schools. The guidance was updated regularly throughout the pandemic as Executive Orders from the Governor and guidance from the CDC changed. Success with resuming in -person learning occurred when an incremental appr oach was combined with fidelity to health and safety protocols. RSSL guidance has been one significant tool for communicating these protocols to LEAs, families, and students. A key factor in the successful implementation of RSSL was staying anchored by t he four Guiding Principles of RSSL: Ensure safety and wellness. The decision to return to school settings must be driven by health and safety considerations. In planning, prioritize basic needs such as food, 5 shelter, and wellness and support the mental, social, and emotional health of students and staff. Cultivate connection and relationship. Quality learning experiences require deep interpersonal relationships and a learning environment where people feel safe, seen, and valued. Especially in the midst of returning to school settings from an extended school closure, supporting students and families should begin with connection and relationship. Center equity. Recognize the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Lat ino/a/x, Pacific Islander communities; students experiencing disabilities; and students and families navigating poverty. Apply an equity - informed, anti -racist, and anti -oppressive stance to promote culturally sustaining and revitalizing educational systems that support every child. Innovate. The complex circumstances in which learning is currently situated requires ongoing reflection and iteration to assure deep learning for every student. Using the above guiding principles, the RSSL guidance was organized by sections to address the following: Returning to In -Person Instruction Public Health Protocols Facilities and School Operations Response to Outbreak Equity Instruction Family, Community, Engagement Mental, Social and Emotional Health Staffing and Person nel Sections 0 -3 in RSSL primarily focused on health and safety requirements and recommendations with provisions for flexibility that honored and recognized the uniqueness of communities across Oregon, and supported schools in designing plans to meet comm unity - specific needs and strengths. Each school was required to submit an \"Operational Blueprint for Reentry\" consistent with the requirements included in RSSL. Sections 4 -8 in RSSL provided clear expectations for instruction, family engagement, mental and social emotional health support, and staffing. For instance, the RSSL guidance provided requirements and recommendations for instructional time, the learning da y, and instructional priorities, and a Safeguarding Student Opportunity clause. This clause attempts to mitigate negative impact to students' learning pathway or access to a high school diploma as a result of the spring 2020 school building closures. ODE r equired districts to recognize the disproportionate and severe impacts of the pandemic on students and families, and districts had to provide every student opportunities to regain their learning stride. An equity decision making tool was provided to assist districts in navigating specific challenges related to equity. ODE content specialists also developed a Designing Learning webpage as a supplemental 6 support to RSSL that provided subject -specific instructional resources for Oregon schools for the 2020 -21 school year. Each subject -area document (English language arts, math, science, social science, health/physical education, and arts), addressed essential instructional sta ndards and content as well as best practices and resources for high -quality instruction. Pandemic Response Strategy 2: Highlight Mental Health Guidance and Resources ODE maintains that mental health is situated within a continuum of care that meets each person's needs for physical and emotional safety, security, social connection, identity, diversity and purpose. Mental health refers to the emotional, social, cognitive, behavioral, physical and relational thriving of individuals and systems. To address th e mental health needs of the education community statewide, ODE supported the internal Safe and Inclusive Schools Team to reinforce a number of bodies of work that focus on mental health promotion, prevention, intervention, services, and supports for school communities. These bodies of work include: Mental Health Toolkit An Integrated Model for Mental Health Mental Health Guidance & Resources CASEL/CCSSO and National Governor's Association Strengthening Mental Health in Education Initiatives Suicide Prevention, Intervention and Post -vention (Senate Bill 52 - Adi's Act) School Safety & Prevention System (SSPS) Every Student Belongs Provision of resources in response to community needs. These res ources were redeployed during the pandemic as educators, communities, parents, and students requested and looked to ODE for mental health and social support resources. The need for these resources is reflected in the data from the Student Health Survey and described further in Section A2 and cited in Section E3. ODE further responded to the need for mental health and support resources with its Mental Health and Social Support for Students and Families website. Pandemic Response Strategy 3: Improve Distance Learning and Close the Digital Divide Initial Guidance: Distance Learning for All The emergency closure of schools during Spring 2020 required school leaders, educators, students, and families to quickly pivot to offering distance learning to respond to COVID -19 and ensure the safety and health of Oregonians. Educators, students, and fa milies responsibly did their best to implement distance learning, following ODE's Distance Learning For All guidance for how to best operationalize learning during the school building closures. Distance Learning for All guidance was Oregon's first effort to ensure care, connection, and continuity of learning for all of Oregon's students during Governor Brown's, \"Stay Home, Stay Safe'' order. 7 Connect Oregon Students Summit for Learning On May 28, 2020, approximately 100 partners from education, business, community -based organizations, philanthropy, industry, governance/policy, and others met to collaborative ly co - create a plan to meet the continuum of opportunity for every Oregon student to access a reliable and engaging digital learning experience. Based on the surveys that ODE conducted with districts, the following financial needs were identified: 80,953 student and teacher devices estimated at $55.3 million 18,739 hotspots for access estimated at $6.6 million 31,931 households needing internet service estimated at $9.8 million for 4 months of service 1,747 Wi -Fi group location sites estimated at $1.2 mil lion As a result of this summit, a private -public partnership was established to help support and influence the initial federal funds dedicated to improve student access to learning in the pandemic. This initial summit provided the momentum needed to gene rate support for the Comprehensive Distance Learning Grant Program. Comprehensive Distance Learning Grant Program The Comprehensive Distance Learning (CDL) Grant Program (also discussed in Section C2) combined funding sources provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, 2020 (CARES Act) to assist school districts with establishing distance learning in response to COVID -19. The CDL Grant Program includes $6.5 million of Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Fund fu nding, and $19.8 million of Governor's Emergency Education Relief (GEER) Fund funding. CDL grant funds were to be used to reimburse eligible expenses incurred between July 1, 2020 and May 30, 2021. There were five categories of eligible expenses under thi s grant program: 1. Access and Connectivity: Adequate infrastructure and/or services that enable net access and connectivity for student learning. 2. Student and Teacher Devices: Appropriate and user friendly devices for students and educators to navigate through distance learning curriculums and programs of study. 3. Digital Content and Curriculum : High quality, adaptable, culturally responsive, and effective digital learning curri culums and content that fosters student learning and engagement. 4. Learning Management Systems: Online technology that allows educators to successfully deliver their teaching content and lessons. 5. Professional Learning for Educators: Various supports and tr aining that ensure effective use of all digital learning tools. This included encouraging LEAs to conduct in -depth studies of the National Standards for Quality Online Learning, including crosswalking of these standards with standards of educator practice. 8 Digital Learning Team Early in the pandemic, when the majority of Oregon schools had shifted to distance learning, ODE began exploring how to form a Digital Learning Team. Prior to the spring of 2020, ODE had two staff working on digital learning, but lacked a more intentional infrastructure or dedicated budget. A Digital Learning Director was hired with the help of ESSER I funding in the summer of 2020. Additionally, a budgetary Policy Option Package was created to fund a more robust digital learning team and was submitted to the Governor and Oregon Legislature as part of ODE's budget request (ODE is still awaiting the outcome of the legislature's budget). The first priorities of the Digital Learning team were to launch the CDL grants as described abo ve and also to create an Oregon Open Learning hub. The Digital Learning Team currently is comprised of three team members. This team is charged with ensuring that digital learning and education technology supports student learning throughout the state, both within the pandemic context and beyond. The scope of the team's work includes interpreting and assisting districts in implementing CDL guidance as it pertains to digital learning and pedagogy, organizing and facilitating promising practices and statew ide collaboration (i.e., biweekly meetings of a statewide Ed Tech Cadre, monthly meetings of a Canvas Admin Users group, and five sessions of a Promising Practices Idea Exchanges for teachers), developing the Oregon Open Learning hub resources, providing access to materials for educators, and overseeing Oregon Digital Learning, a program that currently supports course access for students in rural districts. Issuance of Companion Guidance to RSSL: Comprehensive Distance Learning Guidance In preparing for the 2020 -21 school year, ODE intentionally re -designed and revised the Distance Learning for All guidance. The Oregon Department of Education issued Comprehensive Distance Learning Guidance , A Companion to Ready Schools, Safe Learners: Deepening Care, Connection and Continuity of Learning (CDL) in August 2020. CDL detailed the criteria and requirements of an instructional model for schools planning to provide instruction off -site for the 2020 -21 school year. It was rooted in strong instructional practices, effective educator and student contact time, meaningful peer -to-peer interaction, and equitable learning opportunities. Under a CDL model, schools had the responsibility to: Maintain high -quality instructional strategies adapted to distance learning. Continue to focus on student identity and belonging, care, con nection, wellbeing, and mental, social, and emotional health; Actively engage and nurture relationships with students, families, and community; Center equity in all outreach and communication efforts with parents and caregivers; Provide high -quality, we ll-rounded learning opportunities; and encourage, support, and provide opportunities for active collaboration and communication between school leaders, teachers, and all school staff. ODE is evaluating how we can submit best practices it finds helpful to share in the 9 clearinghouse and will encourage its LEAs to submit lessons learned and best practices to the Department's Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse . 2. Overall Priorities: Provide your assessment of the top 2 -3 issues currently facing students and schools across your State as a result of or in response to the COVID - 19 pandemic including, to the extent possible, data illustrating why these are the most critical and/or most widespread issues facing schools and students. Throughout the last year of navigating the pandemic, feedback from schools, districts, and communities highlighted several key issues facing stud ents and schools across Oregon. The three issues listed below surfaced as priorities: 1. Addressing unfinished learning through asset -based acceleration strategies Addressing unfinished learning as part of a responsive system, grounded in equity, meet ing students where they are and accelerating their learning by building on strengths and creating the conditions to support needs. Distance learning has created conditions where many students from historically underserved communities are falling further be hind because schools do not have the resources to adequately engage their families. During this pandemic, we have seen many community -based organizations work diligently to engage families to find ways to support their children through CDL. While these eff orts are supporting our students, we know additional challenges still exist for children and families; particularly, those from communities most impacted by the pandemic. The digital divide and inconsistent access to high -quality instruction will continue through 2021 -22 as many families continue to choose a virtual option to meet the needs of their student for various reasons. National enrollment patterns reflect the other disproportionate impacts of the pandemic. For example, enrollment in remote learning varies widely by race, with Black, Latino/a/x, and Asian students enrolled at rates 15% -45% above that of White students. For Oregon, enrollment on Octo ber 1, 2020 showed a number of impacts of the pandemic. Total enrollment in Fall 2020 was down nearly 22,000 students from Fall 2019. This represented a 3.7% decline in K -12 public school enrollment. Much of the decline was in Kindergarten where enrollm ent was down by over 6,000 students, or almost 15%. Grades one through six were each down by over 2,000 students (over 5%), while enrollment in grades 7 through 12 were generally similar to the previous year. At the same time enrollment in public on -line charter schools rose by over 50%, representing over 7,000 additional students attending those schools. By percentage, enrollment declines were largest for American Indian/Alaska Native students (over 6%) and for White students (over 5%) while declines fo r Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino students were only about 1%. 2. Prioritizing health, safety, wellness, and connections for all communities Health and safety are critical issues facing Oregon schools as we continue to navigate a global pandem ic. As the majority of Oregon students and staff return to in -person instruction for fall 2021, schools will need to continue to mitigate the risks of COVID -19 by implementing health and safety operational measures. In addition to protecting the physical h ealth and safety of the 10 school community, schools should also address mental health, wellness, and connection for students and staff (see section A1 Strategy 2). One data source that has shined a light on the imperative to address mental health is the Oregon Student Health Survey. Historically, the Oregon Health Authority, in collaboration with the Oregon Department of Education, conducted the Healthy Teen Survey in odd numbered years to 8th and 11th graders. In 2020, the survey was revised and renamed as the Student Health Survey . The survey is an anonymous and voluntary survey of 6th, 8th and 11th grade youth, and going forward, will be administe red in even numbered years. ODE anticipates using the data produced by this survey to help identify strengths, challenges, gaps and opportunities as we work to implement ESSER strategies. The Oregon Health Authority's 2019 Oregon Healthy Teens Survey results show only 53.8% of 8th grade participants and 56.9% of 11th grade participants met the USAID \"Positive Youth Development\" framework. This US AID framework focuses on building strengths and attributes that can buffer the impact of stress and obstacles young people face. Preliminary, unweighted data from the 2020 Student Health Survey, reported: In general their emotional and mental health was fair or poor. o 22.3% of 6th graders o 33.7% of 8th graders o 47.8% of 11th graders Having emotional or mental health care needs that were not met when schools were not meeting in person. o 12.2% of 8th graders o 27.8% of 11th graders Feeling so sad or hopel ess almost every day for two weeks or more in a row that they stopped doing some usual activities. o 41.3% of 11th graders In past 12 months seriously considered attempting suicide. o 15.5% of 11th graders 3. Strengthening high -quality, culturally -sustaining and revitalizi ng instruction, leadership, and pathways to graduation and post -secondary transitions. In order to increase student engagement and accelerate learning in response to the pandemic, students need access to high -quality, culturally -sustaining a nd revitalizing instruction. A priority area for ODE is investing in strategies and supports that strengthen instructional practices and lead to positive post -secondary outcomes. This includes a focus on growing the capacity of school leaders to not only l ead in the areas of health and safety, but also to continue to hone their instructional leadership skills. It also means an investment in programs that provide relevant learning experiences for students that build off of their strengths, identities, and interests. 11 In 2017, Oregon's Education Innovation Officer conducted community engagement sessions with upwards of 1,000 key stakeholders closest to Oregon's education system and published the What Will It Take to Improve Oregon's Graduation Outcomes Report which confirmed the need to focus on equitable practices and outcomes. The recommendations from this report also include the need for relationships, pa rtnerships and relevance within the Oregon education system. In response to the themes listed above and feedback from more recent engagement sessions, ODE is taking a two -pronged approach to provide tools and resources for culturally -sustaining and revi talizing instructional practices while also supporting strategies to diversify the workforce. Decades of research provide data about the positive impacts of educator diversity on academic achievement and social and emotional development for Black, Brown, and Indigenous students, as well as their White peers. Studies investigating the impact of raci al matching for teachers and students found positive results on racially, ethnically and/ or linguistically diverse student test scores and improved perceptions of teachers of color for White students, a key facet of developing anti -racism in today's schoo ls and society (Clotfelter, Ladd, & Vigdor, 2007). Another longitudinal study provided evidence that Black students taught by a Black teacher at least once between third and fifth grade were less likely to drop out of high school and more likely to aspire to go to college (Gershenson, et al., 2017). These disparities were highlighted in section 2 of the 2020 Oregon Educator Equity Report by the Educato r Advancement Council and addressed in Section F of this application. In addition, as Oregon seeks to re -engage students, especially those who have been most impacted by the pandemic, it will be important that we continue to invest in career -connected learning. Engagement in career and technical education (CTE) and earning college credit while in high school is correlated with higher attendance and graduation rates. In 2020, CTE participants (those students taking at least one CTE course) graduated at a r ate of 90.8 percent in four years and CTE concentrators (students passing two classes in a CTE Program of Study) had a 94.8 percent graduation rate in four years. The same communities who have been impacted the most by the pandemic are the communities that see the most benefit from participation in CTE and college credit in high school programs. A critical part of recovery will be to ensure that every student is given the opportunity to participate in relevant career - connected learning as they advance towa rds graduation and post -secondary options. Pandemic Impact Unfortunately, clear measures of educational impact and definitive best practices to assist students and families navigating a prolonged, worldwide pandemic, socio -political upheaval and (in Oreg on) historic wildfires while trying to provide consistent and meaningful learning opportunities were not feasible given the conditions and constraints needed to respond to COVID -19 and collateral impacts. 12 In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, ODE suspende d administration of the statewide assessments for spring 2020. Additionally, the State Board adopted OAR 581 -022-0103, which waived the Assessment of Essential Skills graduation requirement for students graduating in the 2019 -2020 school year. In fall 202 0, the State Board adopted OAR 581 -022-0104, which extended this waiver for students graduating in the 2020 -2021 school year. While the pandemic has disrupted ODE's ability to monitor and address the equity concerns present in student performance and parti cipation patterns, historical data along with other leading indicators signal a further disproportionate impact in math and language arts. The data that we do have demonstrates the impact of the pandemic on students and schools, including: Almost 20% decl ine in FAFSA completion rates (40% in 2021, 52% 2020, 59% 2019) A decline in Oregon community college enrollment Approximately 6,000 students are likely to enter 1st grade without having enrolled in public kindergarten. Many of these students will have had no formal kindergarten experience. Students from historic ally underserved communities continue to have significantly lower attendance rates in 2020 -21 than other students, showing they face greater challenges in accessing distance learning. Many CTE programs were paused or modified during the 2020 -2021 school y ear as a result of lack of in -person instruction. 3. Identifying Needs of Underserved Students: Describe your State's 2-3 highest priority academic, social, emotional, and/or mental health needs for the remainder of the 2020 -2021 school year (if applicable) and for the 2021 -2022 school year related to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on each of the following student groups : i. Students from low -income families, ii. Students from each racial or ethnic group (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by race or ethnicity ), iii. Gender (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by gender) , iv. English learners, v. Children with disabilities (including infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities eligible under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( \"IDEA \")), vi. Students experiencing homelessness, vii. Children and youth in foster care , viii. Migratory students , and ix. Other groups disproportionately impacted by the pandemic that have been identified by the SEA (e.g., youth involved in the criminal justice system, students who have missed the most in -person instruction during the 2019 -2020 and 2020 -2021 school years, 13 students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures , and LGBTQ + students ). To the extent possible, this description should include data on indicators such as estimates of the academic impact of lost instructional time ,1 chronic absenteeism, student engagement , and social -emotional well -being. The specific student groups named in the application have been and remain a focus of Oregon's attention and resources. We are clear about the ongoing and histor ic disproportionality and impact of inequity and that the pandemic only exacerbated these issues; thus, Oregon will use these funds to layer onto existing initiatives as well as implement specific strategies that are formed by community engagement. ODE's three highest priorities listed above in Section A.2. apply to every student including the student groups specified in the ESSER application: 1. Addressing unfinished learning through asset -based acceleration strategies 2. Prioritizing health, safety, wellness, and connections for all communities 3. Strengthening high -quality, culturally -sustaining and revitalizing instruction, leadership, and programming including supporting pathways to graduation and post -secondary planning Throughout the pandemic, ODE has worked alongside community based organizations, tribes, and school districts, to support students and families from historically underserved communities during these challenging times. We identified the priorities in A.2. based on multiple engagement sessions co nducted over the last year with educators, communities, other stakeholders and tribes. ODE recognizes the need for deeper engagement with each of these groups and tribal governments to inform the specific strategies that will be used to fully address our three priorities. (See section C.1. for more in depth information on past and planned engagement.) These strategies will be identified based on ongoing engagement with historically underrepresented groups. The Statewide Education Initiatives Account invests in improving educational opportunities for Oregon students, especially historically underserved stude nt groups. With these investments, historically underserved groups have developed student success plans for: American Indian/Alaska Native Students, African American/Black Students, Latino/a/x and Indigenous Students, and LGBTQ2SIA+ students. Although not explicitly aligned, these comprehensive student success plans affirm the three priorities listed in A.2. Specific to students experiencing disability who receive special education and related services under the IDEA, ODE also believes that our first work is to address the same three highest priorities, and that the first efforts in doing this must be through the same supports available to all students. For instance, students experiencing disability must first be afforded access to the 1 For the purposes of the plan, \"academic impact of lost instructional time \" refers to \"learning loss\" experienced by students as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, as referenced in the ARP Act and the CRRSA Act . 14 asset -based accelera tion strategies used to address unfinished learning across an entire classroom, grade level, school, or system. However, ODE also recognizes that there are and will be instances where these priorities alone will not be sufficient to address the unique need s that arise from a student's disability. Such instances will need to be addressed by the student's IEP team and the consideration of Individualiz ed COVID -19 Recovery Services as appropriate. ODE is working to support IEP teams in making these important de cisions and will continue to provide guidance towards that end. More information about the use of processes and data collection already implemented under the Student Success Act that will be braided with work under ESSER is discussed in Section E. Data on Indicators Student enrollment and attendance data are one of the ways ODE can estimate the academic impact of lost instructional time, chronic absenteeism, student engagement and social - emotional well -being. Clearly this data does not tell the whole sto ry, and additional data should be collected through surveys and other indicators as we recover from the impact of the pandemic. ODE does have some initial data on the impact of COVID -19 on students, and more will be available as the 2020 -2021 school -year c ollections are completed this summer. Enrollment on October 1, 2020 showed a number of impacts of the pandemic. Total enrollment in Fall 2020 was down nearly 22,000 students from Fall 2019. This represented a 3.7% decline in K -12 public school enrollmen t. Much of the decline was in Kindergarten where enrollment was down by over 6,000 students, or almost 15%. Grades one through six were each down by over 2,000 students (over 5%), while enrollment in grades 7 through 12 were generally similar to the previo us year. At the same time enrollment in public on -line charter schools rose by over 50%, representing over 7,000 additional students attending those schools. 15 Table: Enrollment for the 2020 -21 School Year by Grade Grade Fall 2019 Enrollment Fall 2020 Enrollment Change Kindergarten 42,322 By percentage, enrollment declines were largest for American Indian/Alaska Native students (over 6%) and for White students (over 5%) while declines for Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino students were only about 1%. While more information is needed to fully understand the contributing factors, preliminary analysis shows that many families have chosen to delay their children's e ntry into public school by not enrolling them in kindergarten. Many of these children may be entering first grade without any instruction in kindergarten and also without having been identified for (and hence not receiving) specialized services, including learning disability and English language development support. 16 Table: Enrollment for the 2020 -21 School Year by Race/Ethnicity Student Group Fall 2019 Enrollment Fall 2020 Enrollment Change All Students 582,662 560,917 data from Fall 2020 shows that students from historically underserved and marginalized communities continue to face challenges to regular school attendance. Preliminary Regular Attenders data for Fall 2020 show that students from historically underserved student groups continue to experience barriers to school attendance. For example, American Indian/Alaska Native and Black/African American students are twice as likely to not be regularly attending school than White students, and f our times as likely to not be regularly attending as Asian students. (It is important to note that ODE shifted the definition of attendance away from seat time, in order to better reflect attendance and engagement in Comprehensive Distance Learning.) Daily and period attendance was still required to be taken, but it could include participation in video classes, other two -way communication, and posting completed coursework. These changes to the definition of attendance means that attendance data for the 2020 -21 school year should not be compared to attendance data from other years. However, we can still compare 2020 -21 attendance data between student groups to help gauge the effect of the pandemic. 17 Table: Regular Attenders, Fall 2020 Student Group Number of Students Percent Regularly Attending All Students 537,284 76 American Indian/Alaska Native 5,993 60 Asian 321,699 79 Female 259,855 78 Male 276,633 74 Nonbinary 796 68 Economically Disadvantaged 273,698 69 English Learners 51,032 67 Foster 3,905 68 Migrant 13,130 67 Students with Disabilities 75,150 67 Data Notes: 1. Data include students enrolled on October 1, 2020 for at least 50 school days between the start of the school year and December 31. Students are regular attenders if they are in attendance for more than 90% of their enrolled days. 2. Data for Foster and Migrant include students who were enrolled on October 1, 2020 but were foster or migrant in the previous year. 4. Understanding the Impact of the COVID -19 Pandemic: Describe how the SEA will support its LEAs in identifying the extent of the impact of the COVID - 19 pandemic on stude nt learning and student well -being, including identifying the groups of students most impacted by the pandemic. Where possible, please identify the data sources the SEA will suggest its LEAs use in thoughtfully diagnosing areas of need, including data on the academic, social, emotional, and mental health impacts of lost instructional time . Local Education Agencies (LEAs) in Oregon have access to a wealth of data at the local level, much of which is retained locally and not submitted to the state. These d ata can provide real - time and actionable information that can be used in determining areas of need for students. 18 Guidance and supports for use of local data at the LEA level ODE has already developed resources for educators and families to help guide the m through the 2020 -21 school year. Many of these are located at the Ready Schools, Safe Learners web page. ODE will also be releasing guidance for the 202 1-22 school year, starting in Summer 2021. Some of the existing guidance includes: Mental Health and Well -Being Resources Ensuring Equity and Access for students with disabilities Designing Learning for all students during the Pandemic ODE staff are also continuing to provide professional development, coaching, and support for many programs, including but not limited to: Increasing the number of students who are regular attenders Promoting practices so that schools can provide supports for student to finis h 9th grade on track to graduate Promoting Safe and Inclusive Schools Providing guidance to design and implement summer learning programs The above resources and programs begin to suggest the types of information that LEAs could use to identify and suppo rt students most impacted by the pandemic. Additional key sources of information for LEAs to use include, but are not limited to: Universal screening, progress monitoring and the use of local assessment resources and practices, including formative assessme nt practices and interim/benchmark assessments, to adapt instruction to meet student needs Daily attendance and engagement data Family and student empathy interviews Level of success in cou rsework, including core courses Student health and wellness surveys State Data and State Reporting to Identify the Impact of the Pandemic ODE has a number of already existing strategies to collect and report data that can support LEAs in their efforts to identify the impact of the pandemic. These data and reports can pro vide disaggregated data to help monitor progress and make adjustments to state and local ESSER plans. These data collections and reports are described in more detail below. The Student Educational Equity Development Survey (SEED Survey) Oregon is currently piloting the Student Educational Equity Development Survey ( SEED Survey ), with full implementation planned for the 2 021-2022 school year. The SEED Survey will gather information about the educational experiences of students in Oregon and inform ODE regarding how to develop appropriate resources and supports for LEAs in Oregon, and better target those resources and suppo rts where they are most needed. The SEED Survey results will also help ODE better interpret information we are already gathering through statewide testing. 19 SEED Survey information may also help LEAs develop a fuller picture of their local contexts and aid in making strategic improvements to curricula and pedagogy offered to students. The SEED Survey pilot will measure student perceptions in four core constructs at all grade levels: Access to Learning Resources Opportunity to Learn; Self-Efficacy Beliefs ; and Sense of Belonging While the Access to Learning Resources and Sense of Belonging constructs are not content - specific at any particular grade level, the Opportunity to Learn and Self -Efficacy constructs focus on specific content areas in each grade level. Grades 3, 6, and high school review Opportunity to Learn and Self -Efficacy in English language arts; Grades 4, 7 and high school review those two constructs in mathematics; and Grades 5, 8 and high school do so for science. In addition, there are grade -specific constructs measured as follows: Grade 3 -5: Well -Rounded Education Grade 6 -8: Career and Technical Education (CTE) High School: CTE, Extra -curricular Engagement, and Post -Graduate Planning It's important to note that data regarding Well -Rounded Education is collected from other sources in Grades 6 and above, so is not collected here to avoid redundancy. Data from the survey will be used to support the following purposes: Honor the importance and necessity of incorporating student voice into the continuous improvement process for Oregon's public education systems. Provide LEAs with actionable data regarding investments and quality pedagogy that can be used to increase student group outcomes (e.g., academic achievement, graduation rates, p ost-secondary success). Develop promising practices guidance regarding appropriate uses of SEED Survey data independently and in combination with comparison to summative assessment results. Expand reporting beyond outcomes to include information about inve stments and quality pedagogy that Oregon's education systems make in supporting students, their families, and the educators who serve them. Validate summative assessment approaches by reviewing SEED Survey results in comparison to summative results, review ing expected and unexpected patterns in relationships. Statewide Assessment Data Oregon was granted a waiver to suspend Statewide Assessments in English language arts, mathematics and science for the 2019 -20 school year, and for the 2020 -21 school year received 20 a waiver that allowed the state to require these statewide assessments only in the following subjects and grades: English language arts: grades 3, 6, 7, and 11 Mathematics: grades 4, 7, 8, and 11 Science: grades 5 and 8 This, combined with historically low participation rates, means that ODE will have limited statewide assessmen t data until the 2021 -22 school year. While ODE won't have complete data on the impact of the pandemic on student assessment scores during the pandemic, these assessments will help measure the long -term impact to a limited degree. In particular, they will provide (in concert with the SEED Survey) crucial information on progress of Oregon's youngest students as they reach 3rd grade and enter the assessment system and help the state direct resources long -term for those students working to complete unfinished learning from the pandemic. ODE is also positioned to leverage the stability of our assessment system prior to the pandemic to support LEAs in determining where systems of instruction are strong and where improvement is required using target report analysi s in language arts and mathematics. Class Roster The Class Roster collection includes information about self -contained classroom assignments for students in elementary schools, and specific course and class information for students in middle school and high school. This allows the state to produce disaggregated data in a number of areas, such as Enrollment in AP or IB courses Enrollment in math courses at the Algebra 1 level and above Breadth of course offerings and access of students to those courses Career and Technical Education collections The CTE Student collection contains information on which students enroll in approved CTE courses and it also includes their course grades. This information will allow ODE to produce disaggregated data on: The number of students who enroll in CTE courses The number of students who are CTE Participants or CTE Concentrators The expansion of CTE participation is a key component of Oregon's strategy to provide a well - rounded education to al l students. Oregon will m onitor enrollment and concentrator attainment in CTE as well as student participation in work -based learning experiences and attainment of industry recognized credentials. Oregon also monitors postsecondary placement of CTE students by tracking college enr ollment and employment after graduation. Regular Attenders ODE annually reports disaggregated data on the number and percentage of students who attend more than 90% of their school days, and those students who attend 90% or fewer of their school days. While not a direct measure of engagement, it does provide infor mation on students who face barriers to regularly attending school, and research has shown that some 21 groups of students do face more of these challenges and are in need of additional support. This information will allow schools, districts, and the state to monitor successful re -engagement of students who are returning to in -person instruction, and who may be returning to K -12 public education next school year after choosing other options during the pandemic. The Every Day Matters program is ODE's Chronic A bsenteeism Statewide Plan implemented in July 2017 to increase regular attendance throughout the state through three major projects: A statewide awareness campaign and toolkit; Technical support to all school districts through regionalized plans housed i n 10 ESDs across the state; and Grants directly to the school districts with the highest rates of chronic absenteeism. The Tribal Attendance Promising Practices (TAPP) program focuses on Native American students; the strategies emphasize the importance of a family advocate in bridging the distance between schools and children to bring success for Native American students who struggle with absenteeism. However, as TAPP is a school -wide initiative, these efforts have a positive attendance impact for all st udents. The program is a unique partnership between the nine federally -recognized tribes of Oregon and schools participating in TAPP efforts. 9th Grade On -Track The 9th Grade On -Track collection provides the lists of students who earn at least one -quarter of their graduation credits by the end of their first year in high school. Research in and outside of Oregon has shown that students who are on -track at the end of high school graduate at a much higher rate than their peers who have faced challenges in earning credits in 9th grade. The data collected here can monitor progress of the state over time and help determine which groups of students and wh ich schools may need more support to address unfinished learning that occurred during the pandemic. Additionally, the High School Success statute requires eligible grant recipients to demonstrate in their biennial plans how they will provide sufficient ti me for teachers and staff of students in grades 9, to review data on student's grades, absences, and discipline by school and by course, and to develop strategies to ensure at -risk students stay on track to graduate. During the 2020 - 21 school year, High Sc hool Success program staff met with LEAs, charter schools, and Youth Corrections Education Program (YCEP)/Juvenile Detention Education Program (JDEP) facilities to assess each grant recipient's staff collaboration practices. If any recipient did not have a fully implemented collaboration system, required action steps were shared and ODE staff will be engaging in quarterly check -ins to ensure these systems become regular practice. Recipients with exemplary collaboration systems have been asked to share mater ials and these items are being housed in a library for other recipients to utilize in building their own systems. ODE, in partnership with colleagues in the Higher Education Coordinating Commission and the University of Oregon, was awarded a three -year In stitute for Educational Sciences (IES) grant. \"A Study in Equity: Oregon's 9th Grade Transition,\" that leverages our state longitudinal data system (SLDS) to address the efficacy of Measure 98 (High School Success), with a particular 22 focus on 9th Grade On -Track coaches as a treatment intervention. The research design takes advantage of a pre - and post -pandemic interrupted time series, along with teacher surveys and panel discussions, to evaluate the impact of Measure 98 and will provide important contextual information regarding how well Oregon is serving high school students during the grant period (2021 -2024). Staff Collections ODE maintains several staff level collections that provide information on the staff employed and, for licensed staff, how licensu re connects to the classes they teach. These do provide some data on staff shortages, and can provide data on: State and regional growth toward meeting national recommendations on student -staff ratios, such as the number of students per counselor. The numb er and percentage of staff with emergency/provisional credentials, or who are teaching out of field. The years of experience of teachers, and the number and percentages of teachers who are relatively new to the field. Enrollment Collections ODE collects d etailed daily enrollment data for students. These data allow us to understand which students may have completed the 2019 -20 school year, but did not return at the start of the 2020 -21 school year. ODE will also be able to identify those students returning to public education as LEAs resume hybrid or fully in -person instruction, or who may have delayed their entrance to public education and enter as first graders. ODE's data shows the majority of these students were in elementary grades; ODE and the state ne ed to help ensure that these students are receiving the foundational instruction and skills they will need to succeed as they move through their K -12 career. 5. School Operating Status: It is essential to have data on how students are learning in order to support the goals of access and equity, especially for student groups that have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. Describe the current status of data collection on operational status and mode of instruction of all schools in your State . This description must include: i. A description of to what extent, and how frequently, the State collects now and will collect in the future data for all schools in your State on: a. Mode of instruction: The number of schools in your State that are offering fully remote or online -only instruction; both remote/online and in -person full-time in -person instruction; b. Enrollment: Student enrollment for all students and disaggre gated for each of the student groups described in A.3.i- viii for each mode of instruction; and 23 c. Attendance: Student attendance for all students and disaggregated for each of the student groups described in A .3.i- viii for each mode of in struction . In Oregon, there are 197 LEAs with 1,461 schools located throughout the state. ODE created a process in the 2020 -21 school year that tracks the mode of instruction - onsite learning, remote/online learning, and hybrid learning (combination of onsite and remote/online learning) - for each school. These reports provide information on the mode of instruction as well as the number of students participating. ODE collects these reports from LEAs and schools every week and then uses them to update the department's website that provides the status for each school. In terms of enrollment data, the ODE Accountability Team is able to produce disaggregated data by school using our Average Daily Membership collection. This information can then be applied to the appropriate mode of instruction reported, to produce a periodic status report of the number of students disaggregated by student group and what mode of instruction they are currently in. In terms of student attendance, ODE's status report does p rovide the number of students by school that are participating. Using the mode of instruction reported for each school, ODE then has the ability to provide total students participating in each mode of instruction, however, there is currently not a way to d isaggregate the information. ODE will continue to look at the feasibility of how to expand data collections to gather information that disaggregates data based on mode of instruction. ii. The data described in A.5.i.a. and b. using the template in Appendix A (and to the extent available, the data described in A.5. i.c.) for the most recent time period available . Please note that this data can be submitted separately within 14 calendar days after a State submits this plan. The SEA must also make this data publi cly available on its website as soon as possible but no later than June 21, 2021, and regularly provide updated available information on its website . The Department will periodically review data listed in A.5.i on SEA websites . Based on the methodology described in A.5.i.a. and b., ODE is able to provide the information in Appendix A - Tables 1 and 2 and plans to make the information available on its website by June 21, 2021. In addition, the Department's data includes information for all schools in the state and separated by elementary, middle schools and high school. Please note, Oregon defines Hybrid Instruction differently than USED. Oregon's definition i s presented for reference. Hybrid Instructional Model Defined - Any design or operational blueprint that is not fully On -24 Site and in -person (with all students attending on -site every day) or fully in Comprehensive Distance Learning. Hybrid models allow LEAs to adjust for multiple variables and continue to access on -site instruction to the greatest extent possible while meeting public health requirement s. An On -Site instructional model becomes a Hybrid instructional model when any portion of instructional time used to meet instructional hours requirements is delivered in a distance learning format. Hybrid instructional models require prioritization of on -site learning activities and determinations regarding key elements of successful content delivery and engagement from a distance. Additional information can be found in the Hybrid Design Review resource. Note: If a school is operating multiple models (I.e .: K - 4th On -Site and 5th -8th in Comprehensive Distance Learning) then for purposes of reporting the school would select Hybrid as your schools instructional model. iii. To the extent available, a de scription of the planned operational status and mode of instruction for the State and its LEAs for Summer 2021 and for the 2021 -2022 school year. The state legislature has made a significant state investment to get students back into enrichment and academic activities for Summer 2021 that enable peer to peer engagement, address unfinished learning, and support emo tional, social, and mental well -being. As such, the funding provided to LEAs includes preference for programs and services to be conducted onsite. To the extent that online learning provides for a more effective or viable solution for students, this will be allowed. All summer learning activities are voluntary for LEAs and students. Please see Section D.2. for more detail on this summer learning init iative. Oregon is approaching the 2021 -22 school year with the intent of providing onsite instruction to all students in the state. Oregon will be aligning with CDC health guidance and protocols that prioritize the safety and well -being of all students an d staff. These protocols are discussed in more detail in Section B. B. Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining their Safe Operations The Department recognizes that safely reopening schools and sustaining their safe operations to maximize in -person instruction is essential for student learning and student well -being , and especially for being able to address the educational inequities that have been worsened by the COVID -19 pandemic . In this section, SEAs will describe how they will support their LEAs in this vi tal area. 1. Support for LEAs: Describe how the SEA will support its LEAs in safely returning to in -person instruction and sustaining the safe operation of schools . This description must include : i. How the SEA will support its LEAs implementing , to the greatest extent practicable, prevention and mitigation policies in line with the most up -to-date guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC \") for the reopening and operation of school 25 facilities to effectively maintain the health an d safety of students, educators, and other staff ; Complete the table below, adding rows as necessary, or provide a narrative description. Returning to in -person instruction and the safe operation of school facilities are Oregon's highest priorities. These priorities go hand -in-hand with supporting the health and safety of our students, staff and families. Schools not only provide the education that Oregon's children need to succeed, but schools also provide multi -tiered mental health services and supports (prevention, intervention and crisis services), nutritious meals, and access to medical care. To support schools with safe operations and returning to in -person instruction in the 2020 -21 school year, ODE partnered with the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) an d used CDC guidance to develop the Ready Schools Safe Learners (RSSL) Guidance. This guidance included both requirements and recommendations on health and safety protocols. The health and safety aspects of RSSL applied to all Oregon Local Education Agencie s (LEAs), public charter schools and private schools and was updated regularly throughout the pandemic as Executive Orders from the Governor and guidance from the CDC changed. In addition, ODE created supplementary supports, aligned with the RSSL, to commu nicate, respond to, and understand the on -the-ground needs of our schools. In the coming school year, the ODE will continue to support Local Education Agencies (LEAs) to safely return to in -person instruction through an approach that centers equity and f ocuses on health and safety. To do so, ODE will take the following actions - many of which build upon existing efforts. SEA Supports for LEA's Implementation of Health and Safety Protocols . To support LEA's implementation of prevention and mitigation pol icies) for the reopening and operation of school facilities, the Oregon Department of Education (ODE) will: 1. Streamline and update the RSSL guidance for the 2021 -22 school year. ODE is currently engaged in a process to update the Ready Schools, Safe Learners Guidance (RSSL) for the 2021 -22 school year. Below is a timeline of the RSSL revision process: o April 2021 - June 2021: ODE will collect public input by conducting an online survey and facilitating two rounds of virtual engagement sessions with the following partner groups: Charter Schools Small School Districts Medium School Districts Large School Districts Tribal governments Teachers Coalition of Oregon School Administrators Coalition of Oregon School Administrators Equity Board Advisory and Comm unity Groups 26 o June 25, 2021: ODE will release RSSL Requirement Framework for Fall Planning to help schools prepare for returning to i n-person instruction this Fall. This framework will be in line with the most current CDC guidance. o July 22, 2021: ODE wil l release final RSSL Guidance for 2021 -22 school year. This guidance will include the ESSER required health and safety components: mask wearing; physical distancing; handwashing and respiratory etiquette; cleaning and maintaining healthy facilities includi ng improving ventilation; contact tracing in combination with isolation and quarantine; diagnostic and screening testing; vaccinations; and appropriate accommodations for children with disabilities with respect to the health and safety policies. (Refer to Table B1 in Appendix F for how the RSSL guidance currently addresses these health and safety protocols.) o August 2021 - June 2022: Continue to make necessary updates to the RSSL guidance to align with CDC guidance. 2. Dedicate additional state and federal r esources to those most impacted by the pandemic. To support the safe return to in -person instruction, the Oregon legislature passed House Bill 5042 , which provides: o $195.6 million from the Summer Learning Program Account and $10.0 million in Federal Funds for LEA grants for high school credit recovery, K -8 enrichment and K-5 child care grants. o $12 million in General Fund and $11.2 million in Federal Funds for the Early Learning Division to expand existing programs for Summer 2021. o $41.2 million in General Fund for a one -time grant for the Oregon Community Foundation (OCF) award summer enrichment grants for K -12 and Parent -Child support program grants for the summer. 3. Ongoing Technical Assistance, Professional Learning, and Supportive Communication Efforts. ODE will continue to provide technical assistance and on -going communication to LEAs to support the safe return to in -person instruction by: Sponsoring regular office hours for school leaders and staff. Dedicating staff to support an email inbox for Ready Schools, Safe Learners implementation questions and issues. Consistently reaching out to LEAs to underst and their support needs via surveys. Supporting regionalized technical assistance, similar to the network of regional \"reopening advisors\" that ODE deployed in the 2020 -21 school year. Partnering with Oregon's Coalition of School Administrators (COSA) and the Oregon Education Association (OEA) to offer ongoing training and professional learning to teachers and school and LEA leaders throughout the 2021 -22 school year. (Refer to this PowerP oint for an example of a training offered during the 2020 -21 school year.) 27 Collaborating with the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) to continue to build upon training and resource s like Contact Notification and Identification and infection control consultations for schools. Providing regular updates directly from ODE's agency director, through press conferences, public service announcements, written communications, and facilitated engagement sessions. Centralized messaging and website resource hub, resources and updates on a centraliz ed web platform, the ODE's RSSL webpage , including a dedicated section for news and updates . 4. Implementing a statewide media campaign. Recognizing that families and communities are essential parts of a school system, ODE contracted with a local marketing firm to launch a campaign to help families, communit ies and the public better understand health and safety protocols and how a safe return to school is made possible in Oregon. This campaign will restart in mid -July and last until at least mid -September with updated messaging and video ads to appear online, on local television and radio and in newspapers. The messaging will likely align with messaging from the Spring campaign, which included these social media/web/TV ads ( see Videos and PSAs ) and this web page . ODE is also collaborating w ith the Oregon Health Authority on their Safe + Strong media campaign which provides Oregon families with information regarding a broad range of topics including public health guidelines, recognizing and res ponding to mental health concerns, destigmatizing mental health concerns, crisis supports, and links to community resources (food, housing, employment, health and mental health) across the state. 5. Mobilizing and adding staff to ODE's team. During the pandemic, ODE formed a joint, high -level ODE/OHA team to develop, carry out, communicate, and support required and recommended health and safety protocols in schools. To strengthen this effort, ODE is adding three full -time positions who will support schoo ls in implementing measures to return safely to in -person instruction. 6. Identifying available PPE and facilitating delivery to local school districts. 7. Providing statewide school data on web dashboards. ODE is partnering with other agencies to maintain d ashboards so that schools have easy access to important statewide health data, such as school -related cases and outbreaks. ODE and OHA are collaborating with COSA to ensure that the 2020 Student Health Survey is implemented by selected districts. This survey will provide valuable information to participating LEAs regarding student experience with health and wellness during the 2020 -21 school year, including specific impacts of COVID -19 on student health and we llbeing, allowing schools to best plan supports and interventions for a successful return to in person instruction in the fall of 2021. 28 8. Facilitating statewide support of discounted hotspots statewide ; along with broadband supports. The pandemic has dispr oportionately impacted students in rural communities and other students whose families are not able provide computer technical support for the student in the home, or who are not able to afford essential equipment or internet connectivity to access virtual learning. 9. Coordinating school -based mental health prevention, intervention and crisis response. ODE will continue to work with the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) to ensure continuity of mental health, including access to telehealth services. ii. Any Statew ide plans, policies, estimated timelines, and specific milestones related to reopening and operation of school facilities , including any mechanisms the SEA will use to track, monitor, or enforce their implementation ; Statewide Policies and Plans Oregon has operated under a State of Emergency since March 2020. As such, the health and safety of schools has been governed through a series of Executive Orders issued by Oregon's Governor Brown, who serves as Oregon's Superintendent of Public Instruction. In March 2021, Governor Brown published Executive Order 21 -06, which orders public school districts to offer fully on -site, in -person instructi on, with an option for online learning for individual students. The Order continues the requirement of all schools (public and private) to comply with guidance issued by ODE and OHA, including the health and safety protocols outlined in Ready Schools, Safe Learners Guidance . In June 2021, Oregon's State of Emergency is set to expire. At this time, Oregon will return to regular statutory authority and schools will return to their previous local governance structure. As such, Oregon is approaching the 2021 -22 school year with the intent of providing onsite instruction to all students in the state. As stated in this section, Oregon will be aligning with CDC health guidance and protocols that prioritize the safety and well -being of all students and staff. Tracking, Monitoring or Enforcing Implementation of Stat ewide Plans and Policies for Reopening Schools As Oregon moves back to pre -pandemic statutory authority, ODE will monitor and enforce the implementation of statewide plans and policies for reopening schools by: Working with the State Board of Education to enact administrative rules related to reopening of schools such as safeguarding student opportunities, instructional time, health and safety standards, complaint procedures, and accountability; 29 Monitoring other state agencies' policies related to health and safety standards in schools, such as the Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Agency; Tracking and implementing any statutory changes related to reopening schools enacted by the Oregon State Legislature; Monitoring formal public complaints related to reopening plans and policies; Monitoring cases and outbreaks in Oregon's public K -12 schools through the OHA COVID dashboard and providing assistance to LEAs as needed; and Constantly evaluating and tailoring state support t o LEAs to sustain safe operation in schools and maximize in -person instruction. We know that in -person education is essential for student learning and student well -being, especially to address the educational inequities that have been worsened by the COVID -19 pandemic. iii. To what extent the SEA and its LEAs consult with Fe deral, State, and local health officials. This description should include, if available, whether the SEA and its LEAs have received support for screening testing from their State or local health department based on funding awarded by the CDC ; and The Oregon Department of Education has consistently consulted with federal, state and local health officials throughout the pandemic and will continue to do so during the 2021 -22 school year. To better understand these efforts, a brief description of our curre nt and proposed continued practices are detailed below. State & Local Health Officials Consultations To support LEAs during the pandemic, ODE and the Oregon Health A uthority are currently meeting twice a week, and will continue to meet weekly to: Update health and safety protocols to be in line with CDC guidance; Provide answers to questions that are elevated by Local Public Health officials (LPHAs), LEAs, and other partners; Support improved co ordination between schools, LEA s, and local agencies (includ ing LHPAs) to prepare for future COVID -19 outbreaks; Support contract tracing through LPHAs and the ODE guidance for schools to support contact notification and identification ; Develop school -based guidance such as Planning for COVID -19 Scenarios in Schools ; Maintain a process for reporting COVID -19 cases in schools; Track statewide COVID outbreaks and the emergence of any new variants; Coordinate and communicate about screening available for unvaccinated K -12 tea chers and staff; and Implement the COVID -19 School Testing Program , including monitoring testing in schools. 30 To support the connec tion between state and local officials, Oregon deployed \"reopening advisors\" -- dedicated liaison staff throughout the state in the 2020 -21 school year. These reopening advisors served as boots -on-the-ground support for schools and districts, relaying information, barriers, problems, questions, and needs between local schools and state officials. This included needs surfaced through the local public health as well as families and communities. It is the intent of the agency to continue this type of regional ized consultation support in the 2021 -22 school year. Federal Consultation In Oregon, the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) is charged with directly consulting with federal health officials, including the CDC staff. As such, ODE regularly seeks OHA's recomme ndations on CDC guidance and has met, and will continue to meet, regularly with OHA to align mitigation, health and safety protocols within the K -12 school setting. The CDC ELC Reopening Schools Supplement awarded Oregon $127 million to launch screening in K-12 set tings. Below is an outline for Oregon's phased approach for implementing screening: Phase 1 Phase I consists of targeting unvaccinated K -12 staff members for weekly screening. OHA launched this project on April 21, 2021 in partnership with Wi llamette Valley Toxicology (WVT) laboratory in Corvallis, Oregon. Enrollment is confidential and swabs are sent directly to participants' homes by mail. Participants self -swab and return specimens by mail. While shipping delays can be an issue in a large state such as Oregon, WVT is able to return results within 24 hours upon receipt of specimens. Phase 2 Phase 2 consists of expanding screening to camp settings in alignment with CDC Guidance for Operating Youth and Summer Camps During COVID -19. OHA has planned three expansions of current testing strategy during phase 2 with a tentative launch date of June 7, 2021. 1. OHA will expand access to diagnostic testing for all overnight camps leveraging its existing COVID -19 Testing in Oregon's K -12 Schools proje ct. 2. OHA will offer unvaccinated day and overnight camp staff members ' weekly screening by expanding its phase 1 project in partnership with WVT. 3. OHA will offer cohort screening for overnight camp cohorts on day 0 and day 3 -5. While this largely aligns with CDC guidance, it should be noted that CDC recommends pre -arrival testing 1 -3 days prior to camp arrival. While we agree with this as a best practice policy, it also represents a barrier to camp participation and that offering free screening upon arriv al to camp will remove barriers to camp participation. This screening will occur in partnership with WVT but will leverage courier systems to route specimens quickly to the laboratory for a goal turn -around time of < 24 hours. 31 Phase 2 will also be used to explore the options for expanding screening to include students during the 2021 -2022 academic year. Phase 3 Phase 3 consists of expanding screening to K -12 students during the 2021 -2022 academic year. OHA anticipates extending its phase 1 screening for u nvaccinated K -12 staff which offers the benefits of confidential participation and does not require staff to disclose their vaccination status to their employers. The options for expanding screening to K-12 students are under consideration and may include targeting specific age levels or those participating in sports and extracurricular activities. iv. Any guidance , professional learning , and technical assistance opportunities the SEA will make a vailable to its LEAs. As stated above, ODE will continue to provide guidance and opportunities for technical assistance and professional development to LEAs to support the safe return to in -person instruction by: Issuing the Ready School, Safe Learner s guidance for the 2021 -22 school year. This guidance will be in line with the most recent CDC guidance. Sponsoring regular office hours for school leaders and staff; Dedicating staff to support an email inbox for Ready Schools, Safe Learners implementation questions and issues; Consistently reaching out LEAs to understand their support needs via surveys; Supporting regionalized technical assistance, similar to the network of regional \"reopening advisors\" that ODE deployed in the 2020 -21 school year. . Partnering with Oregon's Coalition of School Administrators (COSA) and the Oregon Education Association (OEA) to offer ongoing training and professional learning opportunities to teachers and school and LEA leaders throughout the 2021 -22 school year. (Refer to this PowerP oint for an example of a training offered during the 2020 -21 school year.) Collaborating with the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) to continue to build up on training and resources like Contact Notification and Identification and infection control consultations for schools. Regular upd ates directly from ODE's agency director through press conferences, public service announcements, written communications, and facilitated engagement sessions. Centralized messaging and website resource hub, resources and updates on a centralized web platform, the ODE's RSSL webpage , including a dedicated section for news and updates . 32 2. Safe Return to In-Person Instruction and Continuity of Services Plans: Describe how the SEA will ensure that its LEAs that receive ARP ESSER funds meet the requir ements in section 2001(i) of the ARP Act and the requirements relating to the ARP ESSER funds published in the Federal Register and available to either: (a) within 30 days of receipt of the funds, develop and make publicly available on the LEA's website a plan for the safe return to in-person instruction and continuity of services, or (b) have developed and made publicly a vailable on the LEA's website such a plan that meets statutory requirements before the enactment of the ARP Act, including : i. How the SEA will ensure that each LEA plan includes , or will be modified to include, the extent to which it has adopted policies and a description of any such policies on each of the strategies listed in table B1 ; ODE has determined that the currently required RSSL Operational Blueprint for Reentry meets the ESSER statutory requirements under section 2001(i)(3) of the ARP Act for the Safe Return to In -person Instruction and Continuity of Services plan. Section 200 1(i)(3) of the ARP Act of 2021 - Previous Plans As required by Section 2001(i)(3) of the ARP Act of 202 1, Oregon's current Operati onal Blueprint for Reentry includes key prevention and mitigation strategies such as a Communicable Disease Management Plan; Physical Distancing; Public Health Communication and Training; Isolation and Quarantine; Facility Operations, including cleaning, d isinfecting and ventilation; Face Coverings; and Addressing High Risk Populations. Additionally, the Operational Blueprint for Reentry requires LEAs to affirm that their operational plan meets the requirements of the Ready Schools, Safe Learners Guidance on equity; instruction; family and community engagement; and mental, social, and emotional health. If an LEA i s unable to meet these requirements, it must provide a plan and timeline for coming into compliance. To develop the Operational Blueprints for Reentry, LEAs worked with a district planning team, considered input from school partners; made blueprints pub lically available on the LEA website; and submitted the blueprints to their local school board and the Local Public Health Authority. During the implementation period, LEAs maintained their blueprints on their websites; received and considered public input on their operation; and continued to provide links to their blueprints on the ODE webpage where members of the public could access the Opera tional Blueprints for Reentry from all Oregon schools. Ensuring LEA Plan Includes Health and Safety Policies To ensure that LEA plans includes health and safety policies on each required strategy, ODE will require LEAs to: 1. No later than June 23, 2021 (30 days after the allocation of funds in accordance with Section 2001 (d)(1 ) of ARP Act of 2021 ): Continue to comply with this requirement 33 through their existing Operational Blueprints for Reentry, which includes the required health and safety policies. To validate this, ODE will verify that all LEAs continue to make their operational blueprints publicly available on their websites and will require LEAs to assure that they developed a qualified plan for the safe return of in -person instruction and continuity of services prior to the enactment of the ARP; 2. No later than August 22, 2021 (90 days after the allocation of funds in accordance with Section to Section 2001 (d) 1) of ARP Act of 2021 ): Certify that they have revised their operational plan (after seeking and taking into account public comm ent) in accordance with the new template for the LEA Plan for Safe Return to In -Person Instruction and Continuity of Services. The plan template will require LEAs to describe how it will maintain the health and safety of students, educators, and other school and LEA staff, and the extent to which it has adopted policies, and a description of any such policies, on each of the CDC's safety recommendations listed in Table B1. 3. No later than February 22, 2022 (six months aft er the initial revision and certification on August 22, 2021): C omplete a review of their Safe Return to In -Person Instruction and Continuity of Services plan. During the review, the LEA must seek public input on whether to revise its plan and on any revi sions to its plan, taking into consideration the timing of significant changes to CDC guidance on reopening schools. Going forward, LEAs will be required to complete a review every six months for the remainder of the ESSER performance period. To support L EAs in meeting the requirements, ODE will: Release LEA allocations in accordance with Section 2001 (d)(1 ) of the ARP Act of 2021) no later than May 24, 2021. Verify that all LEAs continue to make their operational blueprints publicly available on their we bsites and , if needed, provide support to LEAs to meet this requirement; Communicate the Safe Return to In -Person Instruction and Continuity of Services process to LEAs by July 1, 2021; and Provide the revised template for the ESSER LEA Safe Return to I n-Person Instruction and Continuity of Services plan to LEAs no later than July 22, 2021. This template will require the LEA to describe the extent to which it has adopted the key prevention and mitigation strategies identified in the CDC guidance. ii. How the SEA will ensure that each LEA plan describes how it will ensure continuity of services including but not limited to services to address the students' academic needs , and students' and staff social, emotional, mental health, and other needs, which m ay include student health and food services ; As stated above, ODE has determined that the current Operational Blueprint for Reentr y meets the Section 2001(i)(3) of the ARP Act , including describing how it will ensure continuity of services related to equity, instruction, family and community engagement, and mental, social and emotional health. In August 2021, Oregon will transition LEAs to a new operational plan template, based specifically on the requirements for the ESSER LEA Plan for Safe Return to In -34 Person Instruction and Continuity of Services. At that time, ODE will again verify that each LEA plan describes how it will ensure the availability of essential services. (Please refer to the next paragraph for more details.) To ensure that the LEA plan describes how it will ensure continuity of services , ODE will require LEAs to: No later than June 23, 2021 (30 days after the alloc ation of funds in accordance with Section 2001 (d) (1 ) of ARP ESSER Act of 2021 ): Continue to comply with this requirement through their existing Operational Blueprints for Reentry, which includes the required health and safety policies. To validate this , ODE will verify that all LEAs continue to make their operational blueprints publicly available on their websites and will require LEAs to assure that they developed a qualified plan for the safe return of in - person instruction and continuity of services prior to the enactment of the ARP; No later than August 22, 2021 (90 days after the allocation of funds in accordance with Section 2001 (d) (1 ) of ARP ESSER Act of 2021 ): Certify that they have revised their operational plan (after seeking and taking into account public comment) in accordance with the new template for the LEA Plan for Safe Return to In -Person Instruction and Continuity of Services. The template will require LEAs to specifically address how they will provide essential services to meet studen ts' academic needs, students' and staff social, emotional, mental health, and other needs such as students' meals and access to medical services. iii. How the SEA will ensure that the LEA periodically review s, no less frequently than every six months for the duration of the ARP ESSER grant period (i.e., through September 30, 2023) ,2 and revise s as appropriate, its plan, and how the SEA will ensure that the LEA seeks public input , and takes such input into account on (1) whether revisions are necessary and, if so, (2) the revisions to the plan ; and To ensure LEAs periodically review and revise, as appropriate, their plans, ODE will require LEAs to: No later than August 22, 2021 (90 days after the allocation of funds in accordance with Section 2001 (d) (1) of ARP ESSER Act of 2021 ): Certify that they have revised their operational plan (after seeking and taking into account public comment) in accordance with the new template for the LEA Plan for Safe Return to In -Person Instruction and Continuity of Services plan. The plan will continue to specifically address how the LEA will: o Implement health and safety protocols (as provided in B1) that are in line with CDC guidance; and 2 ARP ESSER funds are subject to the Tydings amendment in section 421(b) of the General Education Provisions Act, 20 U.S.C. 1225(b), and are therefore available to SEAs and LEAs for obligation through September 30, 2024. Review and revisions of these plans , if necessary, are not required during the Tydings period. 35 o Provide essential services to meet students' aca demic needs and students' and staff social, emotional, mental health, and other needs through, such as students ' meals and access to medical services. No later than February 22, 2022 (six months after the initial revision and certification on August 22, 2 021): Complete a review of their LEA Plan for Safe Return to In -Person Instruction and Continuity of Services. During the review, the LEA must seek public input on whether to revise its plan and on any revisions to its plan, taking into consideration the timing of significant changes to CDC guidance on reopening schools and how it will continue to provide essential services. Going forward, LEAs will be required to complete a review every six months for the remainder of the ESSER performance period. Self-certification: To self -certify, LEAs must provide to ODE: o A signed form that verifies that they have met each review component, including all public input requirements; and o A publicly available link to their revised plan. In addition to LEA self -certific ation, ODE will continue to conduct its regular monitoring process for federal grants. To support LEAs in meeting th e review requirements, ODE will: Communicate the process for transitioning to the LEA Plan for Safe Return to In -Person Instruction and Co ntinuity of Services to LEAs no later than July 1, 2021; Provide the revised template for the LEA Plan for Safe Return to In -Person Instruction and Continuity of Services to LEAs no later than July 22, 2021; Remind LEAs of the review requirements, includi ng public input requirements, three months prior to the review deadline; and Provide Office Hours and Inbox, Virtual and/or in -person question and answer sessions with school leaders and reopening advisors about the ESSER review process. iv. Describe , to the extent the SEA collects it, information about LEA implementation , to the greatest extent practicable, of each element of the most up -to-date CDC guidance listed in table B1 and its LEAs' needs for support and technical assistance to implement strategi es consistent , to the greatest extent practicable, with relevant CDC guidance . 1. Information on LEA implementation of the most up -to-date CDC guidance : ODE will continue to collect information on LEA implementation of CDC guidance through the following methods: Public Complaint Process: ODE monitors how many formal complaints are filed related to the LEA implementation of CDC guidance. School Cases and Outbreaks on OHA COVID Dashboard: ODE tracks school cases and outbreaks. 36 Operational Plans : Tracking t he most recent LEA's Operational Blueprint for Reentry plans and posting them on the ODE webpage . 2. Information on LEAs need for support and technical services with CDC guidance. ODE will continue to collect information on LEA support needs through the following methods: Sponsoring regular office hours for school leaders and staff; Dedicating staff to support an email inbox for Ready Schools, S afe Learners implementation questions and issues; Consistently reaching out to LEAs to understand their support needs via surveys; Supporting regionalized technical assistance and feedback loops, similar to the network of regional \"reopening advisors\" that ODE deployed in the 2020 -21 school year. Partnering with Oregon's Coalition of School Administrators (COSA) and the Oregon Education Association (OEA) to offer ongoing training to teachers and school and district leaders throughout the 2021 -22 school yea r. (Refer to this PowerP oint for an example of a training offered during the 2020 -21 school year.); and Monitoring concerns elevated by Local Public Health officials. C. Planning for the Use and Coordination of ARP ESSER Funds The Department recognizes that seeking input from diverse stakeholder s is essential to developing plans for the use of ARP ESSER funds that are responsive to the needs of students, families, and educators. In this section, SEAs will describe their plans for consultation and for coordinating the use of ARP ESSER funds with other resources to meet the needs of students. 1. SEA Consultation: Consistent with the ARP ESSER requirements , describe how the SEA engaged in meaningful consultation with stakeholders, and incorporated input into its plan, including , but not limited to : i. students; ii. families; iii. Tribes (if applicable); iv. civil rights organizations (including disability rights organizations ); v. school and district administrators (including special education administrators); vi. superintendents; vii. charter school leaders (if applicable); viii. teachers, principals, school leaders , other educators, school staff, and their unions; and ix. stakeholders representing the interests of children with disabilities, English learners, children experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, migratory stud ents, children who are incarcerated , and other underserved students . 37 The description must include how the SEA provided the public the opportunity to provide input in the development of the plan , a summary of the input (including any letters of support) , and how the SEA took such input into account . Oregon has taken bold steps to deepen its commitment to engagement, including how the SEA engages and consults with stakeholders and how LEAs carry out their engagement with their community. In order to under stand how the Oregon Department of Education (ODE) has engaged stakeholders, it's important to capture some of the historic efforts that preceded the COVID -19 pandemic in order to understand 1) our values for engagement and consultations; 2) how we've cont inuously improved our engagement and consultation; and 3) how we will tap into existing systems to inform the ARP ESSER work and requirements. The Passage of a State Law Rooted in Authentic Engagement & Equity During the 2019 legislative session, Oregon's leaders made a real promise to our children, our educators, our schools and our state with the passage of the Student Success Act (SSA). When fully implemented, the Student Success Act is expected to invest $2 billion in Oregon education every two years; that's a $1 billion investment in early learning and K -12 education each year through the Early Learning Account, the Student Investment Account (SIA), the Statewide Educ ation Initiatives Account, and $200 million of additional State School Fund support. At the heart of the SSA is a commitment to improving access and opportunities for students who have been historically underserved in the education system. One of the most promising aspects of this new law is that it is rooted in the ideas of authentic comm unity engagement and equity. For communities and school districts across Oregon, our collective vision to improve schools and the outcomes of students relies on collaboration and partnership. By law, Oregon school districts are required to engage staff, st udents and families, particularly: Students of color; Students experiencing disabilities; Emergent bilingual students; and Students navigating poverty, homelessness, and foster care; and other students that have historically experienced disparities in our schools. To support schools and LEAs with these efforts, ODE published the Community Engagement Toolkit and a Tribal Consultation Toolkit to assist LEAs working with tribal governments. Starting i n 2019, real and noteworthy engagement has occurred in Oregon communities, led by LEAs and charter schools to engage, listen, and plan with students, families, communities, and educators. This is evidenced by the hundreds of engagement artifacts submitted to ODE that tell powerful and authentic engagement stories, and highlight lessons learned from across Oregon. Examining & Reconfiguring ODE's Current Engagement Practices This body of work does not live in isolation of the economic, health, and communit y conditions across Oregon. The opportunities to deepen partnerships while addressing the challenges brought on by systemic racism, poverty, COVID -19, wildfires, loss of power, water crisis, and the 38 hundreds of ways we struggle to respond to the wholeness of students, families, educators, and school leaders are clear, complex and daunting. Since the passage of this new law, ODE has examined its own practices around community engagement. ODE leaders have taken bold action to ensure its engagement with educa tors and the education community is authentic, reciprocal, and honors the strengths of the diverse communities served. At the heart of its work, ODE believes effective community engagement facilitates a process of co -creating a common vision, goals and a p lan where the community is involved in identifying needs and assets, developing ideas and making decisions. It also comes with the shared responsibility among all participants to be engaged in ensuring the success of strategies to achieve the community's g oals. These are examples of how ODE has established a system for consultation with all stakeholders required in this section: Expanding the makeup of advisory committees to reflect the students who have been historically underserved by Oregon's education system. This includes appointing community leaders to existing groups and initiating new groups to inform specific policies. The Department has also established monthly touch -points with each advisory committee/group as a consistent feedback loop to inform decision -making. These advisory groups include: o American Indian/Alaska Native Success Advisory Committee provides guidance, input, advocacy, and recommendations on policy, rules, and legislation related to Indian Education. The committee recommends goals and measurable objectives for the American Indian/Alaska Native Student Success Plan to implement by the Oregon Department of Education. o African American/Black Student Success Advisory Committee provides recommendations, community feedback, guidance, and u pdates to the Oregon Department of Education for the purposes of fulfilling the intent and impact of the Oregon African American/Black Student Success Plan. o Latino/a/x Student Success Advisory Group advises the Oregon Department of Education on educational matters affecting Latino/a/x students and families. This effort will seek to address systemic inequities experienced by Latino/a/x students through focused investments and community partnerships. o English Learner/Emergent Bilingual Advisory Committee is a diverse group of community and district stakeholders who are an important part of Oregon Department of Education's (ODE) decision -making process and effective implementation of the EL Strategic State Plan. This group is composed of district and school admi nistration, teachers, students, parents, and community members. o DACA/Undocumented Committee is a community group that the Department brings together periodically to inform policy and provide input on the DACA/Undocumented Committee Toolkit . 39 o Every Student Belongs Kitchen Table Conversation (Community Advisors) is a community group that the Department brings together periodically to inform policy and provide input on the Every Student Belongs resourc es. o School Safety and Prevention System (SSPS) Advisory is a community group of professionals that meet monthly to inform policy, rules, and guidance related to the School Safety and Prevention System, and Senate Bill 52 (Adi's Act). o LGBTQ2SIA+ Student Suc cess Advisory Committee provides recommendations, community feedback, guidance, and updates to the Oregon Department of Education to address barriers to educational success for Oregonian students who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, non -binary, transgen der, gender queer, two - spirit, intersex, asexual (+). o Rules Advisory Committee (RAC) is a diverse group of stakeholders that seeks public input on the development and drafting of administrative rules as well as whether the rule has a fiscal or small business impact and to what extent that impact will be. o State Advisory Council for Special Education (SACSE) exists to provide policy guidance with respect to special education and related services for children with disabilities in the State. SACSE advises the State of unmet needs in the education of children with disabilities, comments publicly on any rules or regulations proposed by the State regarding the education of students with disabilities, advises the State in developing evaluations and reporting d ata to the U.S. Office of Special Education, advises the State in developing corrective action plans to address findings identified in federal monitoring reports, and advises the State in developing and implementing services for children with disabilities. o State Interagency Coordinating Council (SICC) ensures interagency coordination and to support the ongoing development of quality statewide services for infants, toddlers, and preschool -aged children who experience disabilities and their families. The SIC C advises, advocates and collaborates on state, local and individual levels to maximize each child's unique potential and ability to participate in society. o Early Childhood Inclusion State Leadership Team works to plan and implement a sustainable, cross -agency, state infrastructure for developing and scaling up sustainable high quality early childhood inclusion. o Regional Inclusive Services Management Team serves as a special education advisory group that meets regularly to support the state's Regional Incl usive Services, which provide support for students with high impact, low incidence disabilities. o Dispute Resolution Committee is a special education advisory group that meets periodically to review ODE's due process hearing decisions, complaint resolution s, and mediation activities. The Committee also reviews Department policies & procedures related to dispute resolution and makes recommendations to the Department. o Oregon Educator Equity Advisory Group (OEEAG) helps design and produce the Educator Equity Report as well as provide additional support and input on 40 diversifying the educator workforce. This group is coordinated and hosted by the Educator Advancement Council. o System of Care Advisory Council (SOCAC) provides oversight of children's mental health system planning and System of Care implementation in Oregon. o Children's System Advisory Council (CSAC) serves as an advisory council for OHA's Child and Family Behavioral Health programs. o There are 10 Regional Educator Networks (REN) that are guided by Coordinating Bodies. These Coordinating Bodies consist of a diverse representation of regional stakeholders and must include 51% educators. The Coordinating Body guides how the region will best support educators f rom recruitment to retirement from an educator -driven stance. o Digital Learning Partners (formerly \"Technology Connectivity and Core Capacity Work Group\") is a group of stakeholders who develop recommendations and guidance and engage partners and community to create and implement a statewide Digital Learning Plan that encompasses the vision that each and every student has access to the technology, tools and learning opportunities that are used to individualize engaging learning experiences that address their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses and development as a life -long learner and creator of knowledge. Facilitating, at minimum, bi -weekly discussions with superintendents and charter school leaders about real -time information and changes to school guidanc e. The Department often meets with groups of districts by size (small, medium, and large districts) to better understand how policies and guidance impact local capacity and intersect with community needs. Hosting weekly \"Office Hours\" for all school and LE A staff along with supplemental Office Hours, held weekly and as needed, by program specialists: o Charter School Leaders Office Hours o Federal Systems Office Hours o Private Schools Office Hours o Business Managers Office Hours Continuing monthly Government to Government Education Cluster meetings with leaders from the nine federally recognized tribes in Oregon. Collaborating with the Coalition of School Administrators (COSA) to deliver information; collect information to better understand challenges experienced by school leaders; and take a unified approach to supporting students, staff and families throughout and beyond the COVID -19 pandemic. Facilitating focused engagement with teachers to listen and learn from their stories, experiences, shared concerns and wonderings in order to inform guidance for schools throughout the 2020 -21 school year. Partnering with the Oregon Education Association (OEA), Stand for Children, Foundations for a Better Oregon, and other organizations. Proactively sharing information wi th legislators and other policymakers. Creating a system for students, families and the public to share their input through a statewide survey. 41 To see additional detail on the correlation between the Department's community engagement and the focal groups listed in Section C.1.i. -ix., please refer to Appendix G 2020 -2021 COVID -19 Targeted Community Engagement SEA engagement incorporated input into this plan The COVID -19 pandemic prompted a change in practice: facilitating engagement and deepening relationships with our community in a virtual environment. Despite the mode of engagement, ODE has continued to host meetings with our stakeholders an d has developed six critical bodies of guidance informed by the input from the engagement. These resources will shape how the Department guides districts in planning to use their ARP ESSER funds and how the state will invest its portion of the funds. Two resources provide the core framing for Oregon's ARP ESSESR priorities. First is the Equity in Education Investment Framework , which was shaped t hrough input from our advisory groups and COVID -19 engagement sessions. This framework is designed to guide LEA and state investments that are centered in education equity and support school safety and wellness. ODE is currently sharing this Framework broa dly through current engagement efforts. Each of Oregon's guiding priorities named in Section A.2 are embedded within this framework. The second resource is Student Learning: Unfinished, Not Lost , which reframes student learning needs from the deficit -based lens of \"learning loss\" to \"unfinished learning,\" an asset - based approach to meet students and families where they are and account for the learning they gained during the pandemic. In addition to reframing learning, this resource encourages educators to prioritize acceleration over remediation, again, starting where students are and moving forward instead of repeating prior lessons. Finally, the document reframes \"recovery\" into \"renewal\" where education systems acknowledge what was gained over the last year, like improved family involvement and relationships, and builds on this to create a stronger system post -pandemic . The strategies identified in the implementation of Section 2001 (f) of the ARP, as described in Section D, are intentionally broad until we can do further engagement. However, Section D continues to build off of this framing and will use this input to sh ape ongoing planning. Three other resources that have been developed in close consultation with community partners include the Mental Health Toolkit , the Summer Learning Best Practice Guide , and the various student group advisory plans (Appendix J includ es links to each plan). These extensive resources contain much of the guidance, information, and community voice Oregon will need to begin planning specific strategies to achieve each of the ARP ESSER priorities in Section A.2. SEA provided the public wi th the opportunity to share input in the development of the plan From the beginning of the pandemic, ODE has engaged the entire State of Oregon through our targeted groups as described above. In May 2021, the Department coordinated four engagement sessions specific to ARP ESSER. These sessions were conducted virtually and included 45 participants from the following groups: 42 African American Black Student Success Advisory Committee Latino/a/x & Indigenous Student Success Advisory Group American Indian/Alaska Native Advisory Committee English Learner/Emerging Bilingual Advisory Committee State Advisory Council for Special Education (Current & Incoming) LGBTQ2SIA+ Advisory Committee ODE/SBE Rules Advisory Committee Summer Learning Collaborative Oregon Advocacy Commissions Office, Advocacy Commissioners, and Community Stakeholders State Leadership Team Dispute Resolution Committee State Interagency Coordinating Council Racial Justice Council + ERC Education Partners (COSA, OSBA, OEA, etc.) Philanthropy Partners (FactOregon, Oregon Business Council, Better Oregon, etc.) In each session, ODE provided a clear overview of the federal funding, and a summary of how the Department has incorporated ongoing prior engagement into Oregon's ARP ESSER priorities from Sectio n A.2. Participants evaluated the information and provided input on essential considerations for the ongoing planning and investment of ARP ESSER funds. Several themes emerged that were important to participants across all three priority areas: 1. Family Engagement: Realize family and community engagement strategies in each area and hold LEAs accountable to their plans. 2. Centering Equity: Don't let equity get lost in the shuffle within each priority area. 3. Disparate Impact: Students in special educati on, in foster care, from highly mobile populations, who are BIPOC, from areas with low vaccination rates, and others were affected differently and may need different solutions in each area. 4. Grade Level Transition: Assessments can be a part of ensuring stud ents are acknowledged for their achieved mastery, acknowledging students may not need to only be learning in one grade level across subjects. 5. Sustainability: The one -time nature of these funds is of concern when it comes to sustaining efforts in each area, as well as ODE's ability to support the continuity. The feedback from these sessions were compiled into a report that was shared back with all participants, shared with Department staff, and will be the first in an iterative process of ongoing community engagement and plan development. ODE will conduct ongoing meaningful engagement with stakeholders The Department will continue to develop a comprehensive set of strategies for the ARP ESSER funds in the coming months using feedback from ongoing engagement and consultation with the US Department of Education. ODE will utilize established networks to expand and deepen engagement with the advisory groups, partners, and the public to assess ODE's progress toward 43 developing a plan that reflects the needs of our communities. All feedback collected will be carefully captured by a core team at the Department who will create reports to inform Department staff supporting ARP ESSER programs and thoughtfully share back to the communities a synthesis of their feedback a nd how it will be used to inform state planning. Additional engagement efforts with Tribal governments will occur as applicable. 2021 -2024 Ongoing Community Engagement Plan Summer/Fall 2021 Identify staff and build Department capacity to lead ESSER work Coordinate with US Department of Education on ESSER Plan Continue updates and engagement with communities and established groups Winter/Spring 2022 Build Department capacity to lead ESSER work Share draft strategies through ongoing community engagement Evaluate 2020 -21 School Year & Summer data, Refine strategies Summer/Fall 2022 Build Department capacity to lead ESSER work Share final strategies through ongoing community engagement Refine strategies and prepare implementation 2023/2024 Sustain Depa rtment capacity to lead ESSER work Continue ongoing engagement for continuous improvement Implementation and evaluation As the state's ARP ESSER plan is being developed, the Department will post updates and drafts to the ODE ARP ESSER Website . In addition, ODE's agency director will provide monthly reports to the State Board of Education in public meetings where public com ment is received. The Department will schedule regular updates and presentations to the State Board of Education and will collect public comment at these meetings to be used to inform implementation. Staff will capture public input and consider recommendat ions as the plan is finalized. 2. Coordinating Funds : Describe to what extent the SEA has and will coordinate Federal COVID -19 pandemic funding and other Federal funding. This description must include: i. How the SEA and its LEAs 1) are using or have used prior to the submission of this plan and 2) plan to use following submission of this plan , Federal COVID -19 funding under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act and the CRRSA Act to support a safe return to and safely maximiz e in-person instruction, sustain these operations safely, and address the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on individual student groups (including students from low -income families, children with disabilities, English learners, racial or ethnic minorities, students 44 experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care , and migratory students ); Complete the table below or provide a na rrative description. ESSER I/GEER I and ESSER II/GEER II - CARES Act and CRRSA Act Since the award of CARES Act funding, ODE has been coordinating federal COVID -19 relief funding for LEAs and other education partners across the state. Under the CARES Act, and the subsequent CRRSA Act approved in December 2020, ODE has administered and allocated the majority of $694.5 million in funds from ESSER and GEER. The funding provided through GEER has been awarded to ODE as the administrator on behalf of the Governor, however, $44.0 million of this funding has been allocated specifically for higher education, early learning and child care programs, and emergency assistance for non -public schools (EANS). The remaining $650.5 million of funding has been focused primarily for ODE as the SEA, LEA's and other K -12 education partners to ensure the continuity of education for all students in Oregon's K -12 public education system. Between CARES and CRRSA (ESSER I, II, and GEER I and II) ODE has allocated $3.4 milli on for overall administration. With a portion of these funds, ODE provides guidance to LEA's through the Ready School, Safe Learners 2020 -21 Guidance and companion tool Ensuring Equity and Acces s: Aligning State and Federal Requirements . This guidance supports LEAs in using the resources they are allocated to provide for the safe return of all students and safely maximize in-person instruction, as well as sustaining those operations as the threat of the pandemic decreases. ODE also produced the Summer Learning Best Practices Guide 2021 which provides informat ion regarding the utilization of various state and federal funding sources as districts plan summer learning opportunities. Of the remaining $647.1 million, 97.4% ($630.4 million) has been dedicated to K -12 public education and has been allocated in a wa y to ensure education partners recognize and address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on the identified student groups. The sections below summarize how these resources were awarded. District Formula Grants $559.2 million The bulk of the allocated resources, 88.7%, have been provided as School District Grants to all 197 of Oregon's LEAs. While the 90% requirement in ESSER does not dedicate funding to every LEA, Oregon has used some of the state set -aside funding to ensure all LEAs and Oregon students are provided with funding to help overcome the impacts and challenges created through COVID. While LEAs are still in the process of spending these funds, the early focus by LEAs has been primarily on expenses related to providi ng technology support for distance learning, and additional cost for teachers, including professional development, that help with additional learning supports. As the state began transitioning to either onsite or hybrid learning in late winter/early spring , the funding has begun to shift and focus more on the safe reopening of schools which has 45 included upgrades of air ventilation systems, additional custodial and cleaning costs, capital improvement and expansion to enable social distancing, and additional transportation expenses. Comprehensive Distance Learning (CDL) Grants - $26.3 million (ESSER I and GEER I) Early in the pandemic, Oregon schools faced the reality they would not be able to provide onsite education, and all student education would be pro vided through remote and distance learning. To address this, LEA s were required to complete plans that ensure the ability to implement some form of distance learning platform for schools and students. The CDL Grants were provided to 196 (one district decli ned the funding) of Oregon LEAs for the purposes of addressing the barriers of distance learning and providing effective learning for students from a distance. These funds provided student devices, internet connectivity, digital learning platforms, profess ional learning for educators, and other direct support for distance learning. The funding was also allocated to ensure that larger shares of funding be allocated to school districts with higher rates of poverty, larger populations of migrant students, and/ or identified as small, rural, or remote. Education Service District Support Grants - $12.9 million (ESSER I and II) Education Service Districts (ESDs) provide critical support to LEAs in ensuring they are able to meet the needs of their students. This inc ludes support in areas such as technology, coordination of education services, facilitation, warehousing, and technical assistance. Support Grants have been provided to 19 ESDs throughout the state to help LEAs in responding to the impacts of the pandemic. While services vary depending on the needs of the LEAs served by the ESD, some of the primary areas of focus have been: Supporting the development of LEA RSSL Plan; Serving as the central warehousing and delivery mechanism of PPE to LEAs; Providing criti cal technology services to small and remote LEAs that lack the capacity for distance learning; and Coordinating efforts such as teacher and student vaccinations. State Specialized Services Programs - $14.9 million (ESSER I and II) ODE, LEAs, and ESDs all have contractual responsibilities to provide a variety of services to students with specialized needs. These include services to students that are currently in youth corrections or juvenile detention, hospital care, and long term care and treatment. T his also includes children and students attending their home schools that require education support based on their specialized needs. In addition to this, ODE is responsible for the Oregon School for the Deaf and four State Sponsored Charter Schools. To su pport service providers in helping their students overcome the challenges of the pandemic and ensure a continuity of ongoing learning, grants have been provided to each organization that provides these unique and very critical programs. 46 Statewide Public Awareness Campaign - $7.0 million (ESSER II) As Oregon began to return students back to onsite or hybrid learning in the late winter/early spring, it was recognized that there was still much apprehension and fear on the part of families and students returning. While the state has gone to great lengths in following all CDC health guidelines and setting up for a high degree of safety protocols, there needed to be more communication and assurance provided to the public. As a result the state invested in a contract that provides for both current and ongoing public awareness about the safe return to onsite learning. This includes the use of statewide media and advertising to inform the public about school safety measures, as well as health guidelines that provide reassurance for students. District Broadband Initiatives $10.1 million (GEER II) The Governor has been very clear that as a state, we must learn from the pandemic and begin work to address and overcome the challenges we experienced during this time. One of those significant challenges has been internet connectivity for students in rural and remote areas of the state. As the state was thrust into distance learning, many students in these areas of the state did not have the connectivity necessary to accommodate online learning. To begin addressing connectivity challenges, the Governor has allocated $10.1 million in grants to LEA's to finance the necessary infrastructure to enable higher quality and scalable internet connectivity. ESSER III - ARP Act As Oregon transitions to the next iteration of ESSER (ESSER III) provided from the American Rescue Plan Act, 2021 (ARP Act or ARPA) and the submission of the required state plan, the focus will be on the 3 priorities outlined in Section A.2. Through ES SER III, Oregon has been allocated $1.121 billion. As with ESSER I and II, Oregon again provided School District Formula Grants by using the required 90% allocation, as well as set aside funding to ensure all state LEAs receive support. In addition, the st ate will allocate a portion of the set aside to ensure the four State Sponsored Charter Schools and the Oregon School for the Deaf receive funding. In total, this will account for 90.43% of the funding allocated through Oregon. Oregon reserved the allowed 0.5% for administration, leaving a remaining 9.07% of the SEA set - aside which has yet to be allocated. The timing of the submission of this plan did not align with meaningful feedback from community members, policy makers, and the Governor's office. In addition, ODE is waiting to receive the IDEA allocation from the ARP Act and doesn't want to exclude planning for students who experience disabilities if additional IDEA funding is inadequate. ODE's commitment for these funds, as well as the allocations made to date, is to focus on strategies that meet the following priorities in Section A2. As ODE begins to allocate its remaining set -aside resources from ESSER III for specific strategies, it will focus on proven and best practices at both a state and natio nal level and be informed by critical needs identified through engagement that has and will continue to occur. In addition, the Department will work in alignment with Oregon's Governor who is the Superintendent of 47 Public Instruction, to ensure the targeted strategies are not only in alignment with the priorities identified above, but also are in support of Oregon's state education goals and objectives. As planning for the remaining set -aside continues, ODE will center equity and continue to coordinate with other federal resources to address the ongoing needs of the identified student groups. ii. To what extent ESSER I and ESSER II funds have been awarded to LEAs and, if funds have not yet been made available to LEAs , when they will be . In addition, please provide any available information on the total dollar amounts of ESSER I and ESSER II funds that have been obligated but not exp ended by the SEA and its LEAs , including whether the SEA is able to track LEA obligations . The grant awards, obligations, and planned commitments made with ESSER I and II are outlined below. ODE tracks LEA and Education Service District (ESD) expenditures, but not their obligations. The Department tracks both expenditures and obligations for funds alloca ted to the Oregon School for the Deaf (OSD). ESSER I: o All $121.1 million of ESSER I has been fully awarded and obligated. o To date, 96.1% of ESSER I Funds have been allocated to LEAs. 3.4% has been allocated to Education Services Districts (ESDs) and th e Oregon School for the Deaf, with the last 0.5% dedicated to ODE administration. o Oregon schools have been reimbursed for 70% of the obligated ESSER I funding to date. The remaining balance of the ESSER I obligation not yet claimed for reimbursement by LEA s is $38.1 million. While these funds have not been paid out by ODE, it is anticipated that most have been expended by LEAs, but just have not submitted their claims for reimbursement. ESSER II: o 96.7% of the $499.2 million of ESSER II funds have been awa rded and obligated. o In total, 91% of ESSER II has been allocated to LEAs and 3.7% to ESDs. There is 1.4% dedicated to a statewide public awareness campaign and 0.5% for administration. 3.4% is unallocated. o The 3.4% set -aside, as described above, h as been partially awarded and obligated. The remaining is anticipated for award and obligation by the end of June 2021. o To date, $482.4 million has been awarded or dedicated and $16.7 million is currently being reviewed and evaluated to determine the best and most strategic use of the resources. o As of May 21, 2021, $9.6 million has been claimed for reimbursement. The remaining balance of the ESSER II obligations not yet claimed for reimbursement is $465.4 million. 48 iii. In supporting LEAs as they plan for the safe return to and continuity of in-person instruction and for meeting the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of students resulting from the COVID -19 pandemic , the extent to which the SEA is also using other Federal funding sources including but not limited to under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( \"ESEA \"), IDEA, Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act ( \"WIOA \"), funding for child nutrition services, and McKinney -Vento Homeless Assistance Act, and the funds to support the needs of students experiencing homelessness provided by section 2001(b)(1) of the ARP Act.3 ODE has made several tools available to support LEAs to maximize the use of COVID -19 relief and other federal funding sources. Some of the specific tools and strategies are detailed below. IDEA: Throughout the pandemic, ODE has developed guidance, tools, and resources for LEAs as they serve students who experience disabilities which can be accessed through the ODE COVID - 19 Resources for Special Education website . Oregon has not yet received its final ARP IDEA allocation increase information, but is anticipating sending around $30 million in additional dollars to LEAs, over $2 million to preschools, and over $2 million to infant and toddler programs in support of special education services. When the parameters of this funding are known, ODE will provide additional guidance and resources to LEAs to utilize these dollars in conjunction with other state and federal funding sources. Title IV -B, 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC): Since the beginning of the pandemic, 21st CCLC programs have continued to serve stud ents and families during out -of- school time. Whether it was leveraging partnerships to ensure Emergency Child Care was available, food delivery coupled with enriching activities delivered to students and families, or through distance learning and the distr ibution of hands -on science kits, 21st CCLC programs have adapted to deliver services in ways that never existed before. Of the 24 grantees offering service representing 101 community learning centers statewide, 75% assembled and provided physical learning kits to students. 91% of grantees offered synchronous and/or asynchronous virtual activities. These virtual 21st CCLC centers provided students a digital safe place to socialize and express themselves, which was found to be particularly important after be ing \"on mute\" all day in the virtual classroom setting. They also provided practical support to families and caregivers, as well as offered engaging activities for families to participate together. For instance, developing hubs where families can seek supp ort with technology issues in -person 3 Please note that the needs of students experiencing homelessness must be addressed (along with the other groups disproportionately impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic) through the use of the ARP ESSER SEA reservations and the required LEA reservation for th e academic impact of lost instructional time; the funding provided to support the needs of students experiencing homelessness by section 2001(b)(1) of the ARP Act is in addition to the supports and services provided with ARP ESSER funds. 49 and virtually and providing resource lists to help with paying for utilities, mental health supports, and food pantries. To support grantees in these efforts, Oregon created the 21st CCLC Companion Guidance to Ready Schools, Safe Learners which included 21st CCLC Op erational Blueprints to ensure the health and safety of students, staff and families and the requirements for instructional models during out -of-school time. Oregon initially provided technical support with weekly meetings, then eventually with bimonthly m eetings and optional Office Hours where programs could ask specific questions or grapple with a problem of practice. To mitigate the effects of unfinished learning as LEAs shift to more in -person instruction in the summer of 2021, Oregon's 21st CCLC progra m held the Infinite Possibilities of Summer Learning Conference: Centering Equity, Engagement and Opportunity focused on centering equity through purposeful program planning and strategic use of braiding state and federal funds to create inclusive programs. Other areas included child nutrition coordination, student recruitment, incorporating Social Emotional Lear ning, CTE, project -based learning, and well -rounded learning. This summer learning conference was developed in collaboration with community partners as well as ODE's Title I -C, Title III, Title I -A, and Title IV -B teams. Support from our McKinney -Vento, Fo ster Care, and state summer grants teams were also embedded throughout the conference. Oregon's 21st CCLC program conducted Progress Monitoring Interviews resulting in a 21st CCLC Interview Summary Report focused on the impacts of COVID -19 as a check to ensure federal dollars were being spent wisely and as way to inform additional technical supports needed, innovative practices, and implementati on of 21st CCLC programming with varied instructional models. Additionally, approximately $1,000,000 in supplemental 21st CCLC funds will be awarded to grantees looking to enhance or expand programming. Oregon will prioritize award amounts for programs tha t: Add or enhance school year schedules in 2021 -22 (extend hours of operations, operate 5 days a week to support working families), Add or enhance summer programs, Provide additional SEL supports, Provide student recruitment and outreach efforts (hire a n outreach coordinator), Expand partnerships, and Do not have remaining 18 -19 or 19 -20 funds. The priorities for these supplemental funds are based on the 2019 -2020 Overall State Evaluation of Program , program interview report, and grantees discussions from meetings based on what is working well in programs and what is needed to improve. McKinney -Vento: In addition to the pandemic, Oregon experienced an un precedented wildfire season that resulted in entire schools and communities burning to the ground. As a result, many of our communities experienced significant trauma. We are still determining how many of our students are experiencing houselessness as a re sult of the wildfires. Our migrant students and families also experienced significant disruption to their education and lives since 50 the fires were in our agricultural and farming regions. Oregon provided additional emergency relief funds to our LEAs and re gions in the Fall of 2020 and has been working with our families and students to ensure they get the support they need. ODE provided emergency funds to LEAs via Title I -C funding to ensure that migrant families received the support needed including food, shelter, and supplies. In addition, ODE expanded support for Oregon's McKinney -Vento (MV) eligible students and increased liaison training. Transportation was one of the biggest barriers to MV and Foster Care students attending school, so ODE worked with LE As to ensure that MV and Foster Care students had access to in -school and afterschool programs by providing additional training around transportation access and needs. Child Nutrition Programs: USDA waivers have allowed LEAs to provide meals in non -congr egate methods (e.g., grab -and-go, meal delivery via bus routes, and meal delivery directly to homes). These flexibilities have aided schools as they have provided hybrid instruction and comprehensive distance learning. Additionally, USDA waivers have allow ed LEAs to provide multiple days' worth of meals allowing families to pick -up more than one meal at a time. LEAs that provide meals are reimbursed through USDA funding. These waivers and meal reimbursements have allowed for families to continue to receive meals that would have normally been served at school. USDA is also providing additional funding to LEAs, and the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) organizations for expenses incurred during specified months at the initial stage of the pandemic to help offset losses of program revenue. Other Tools: When the Governor's executive order closed schools in March of 2020, ODE staff held monthly webinars to help LEAs track the quickly changing requirements and answer questions relative to the use of federa l funds to support LEA needs due to the shift to remote learning. At the beginning of the 2020 -21 school year, the Federal Systems Team (FST) implemented office hours to allow LEAs regular access to ask questions of ODE staff and share problems of practice with their peers. LEAs have consistently attended and indicated that they value these opportunities to seek clarity. The FST intends to continue this practice next school year. Anticipating significant LEA investment of both state and federal dollars in summer school, ODE released Summer Learning Best Practice Guide: Supporting Mental Health, Addressing Unfinished Learning and Providing Enrichment Opportunities in April of 2021. This guide draws upon research and best practices for how to design and implement summer learning programs and, while it aims to support summer learning for all students, it prioritizes prog ramming for migrant students, emerging bilingual students, students experiencing disabilities, and students in need of high school credit. Particular emphasis is placed on how to \"braid\" funds to ensure maximum benefit to students and flexibility to LEAs. 51 D. Maximizing State -Level Funds to Support Students The Department recognizes that States have an extraordinary opportunity to address the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on underserved students through the ARP Act's required State set -asides to address the academic impact of lost instructional time, provide summer learning and enrichment programs, and provide comprehensive afterschool programs. In this section, SEAs will describe their evidence -based strategies for these resources. 1. Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time : Describe how the SEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(f)(1) of the ARP Act (totaling not less than 5 percent of the State's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds ) on evidence - based interventions to address the academic impact of lost instructional time by supporting the implementation of evidence -based interventions, such as summer learning or summer enrichment, extended day, comprehensive afterschool programs, or extended school year programs, and ensure t hat such interventions respond to students' academic, social, emotional , and mental health needs . The description must include: i. A description of the evidence -based interventions (e.g., providing intensive or high -dosage tutoring, accelerating learning ) the SEA has selected, and the extent to which the SEA will evaluate the impact of those interventions on an ongoing basis to understand if they are working ; Over the past year, the phrase \"learning loss\" has been used to describe the impact of the COVID -19 p andemic on student learning. Despite a disrupted school year, there are countless stories and artifacts of student learning, progress, and strength. While academic learning may be unfinished, it is not lost. With commitment and care, educators, school lead ers, school support staff, families and communities continue to provide students with opportunities to learn while also tending to students' physical, social, and emotional needs. A responsive system, grounded in equity, meets students where they are and a ccelerates their learning by building on strengths and needs. Collectively, this means redesigning teaching and learning and reexamining deeply rooted deficit -based thinking. The three strategies below paint a broad picture of the Oregon Department of Ed ucation's interventions, leaving space for community input and co -creation. Upon meaningful, intentional engagement with community, educators, and families, these three strategies will become more specific and targeted. The disproportionate impact of the C OVID -19 pandemic on students underserved by the system will only be addressed when we are in the right relationship with our students and community, listening well and responding to their strengths and needs. With future engagement will come deeper clarity and precision around specific interventions within each of the following three areas of focus. Focus on accelerated learning . In contrast to remediation efforts, which perpetuate low expectations and lead to disparate outcomes, students who access accelerated learning and advanced coursework demonstrate consistently higher learning 52 outcomes and increased engagement. This partic ular strategy will create or expand existing efforts to increase statewide capacity to provide accelerated learning opportunities to all students. The state funds will be used to focus expanding opportunities to students currently and historically underser ved by the system. For all students, this will include a focus on ensuring that students have access to grade level or above standards in all content areas. In addition, this may include increased enrollment in AP/IB/Dual Credit programs. Reframing a focus from remediation to accelerated learning will directly assist those students who have lost the most instructional time due to school closures and online learning settings. Design best practice tools & resources for teaching and learning. The intent is t o include high -quality: 1) formative assessment practices that honor student identity and agency to determine where learning must be accelerated; 2) professional learning opportunities for educators on learning acceleration , culturally affirming and sustaining pedagogy , and technology -enabled instruction to ensure students have access to well -rounded, world -class academic experiences; 3) strategies and professional learning for principals and teachers to leverage school -based teacher leadership , distributed leadership , and innovative staffing models to provide supervision and support to tutors and teachers; and 4) culturally responsive and representative instructional materials investments . Support Career, College and Community Readiness. Work with LEAs and other educational partners to re -engage high school students who need additional credits to graduate and provide support and guidance for students to navigate the transition to career and/or college. This could include using federal and state funds to expand existing statewide efforts to address unfinished learning, provide well -rounded educational experi ences, and create career -connected learning systems. A core component of this work includes working with existing high school success and career and technical education programs to ensure that each LEA has an equity -centered plan to invest in drop -out prev ention, accelerated learning opportunities (i.e., dual credit), and CTE programs that are tailored to local needs and careers of the future. ODE will work with LEAs and other educational partners to expand college and career counseling and financial aid su pport. ii. How the evidence -based interventions will specifically address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3.i.-viii. When possible, please indicate which data sources the SEA will use to determine the impact of lost instructional time ; and Educators, community, and students know firsthand the high cost of this prolonged period of distance learning, from the toll on mental health to the lack of access to in -person learning. The shutdown of face to face teaching in schools resulted in the majo rity of Oregon's students spending over a year engaged in distance learning, compounding racial disparities in learning 53 and achievement. While we have made significant efforts to close the digital divide and improve distance learning, the implementation of school -based health and safety precautions enabled most students to return to classrooms in the spring of 2021. However, Black, Latinx and Indigenous students continue to be more likely to remain remote and are less likely to have access to the prerequisi tes of learning \u2014devices, internet access, and live contact with teachers. Left unaddressed, these opportunity gaps will translate into wider achievement gaps. While all students are suffering, those who came into the pandemic with the fewest academic oppor tunities are on track to exit with the greatest learning loss. The three strategies listed above when well implemented, will disrupt the negative consequences of the impact of COVID -19. These strategies will help eliminate current unfinished learning, and give educators the skills and training needed to reduce or eliminate ongoing and invasive historical opportunity gaps. Students historically underserved by the system are also the students that have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID -19 pandemi c. Specific interventions will become sharper and more focused upon meaningful engagement with the groups named in A.3.i -viii. At a high level, these three areas will help to ensure students are successfully reengaged, learning grade level or above conten t, and receiving quality feedback on their work and learning. The data sources that we will most likely use to determine the impact of loss instructional time will be: 2021 and 2022 graduation rates 2020 -21 student attendance data Statewide SEEDs survey results FAFSA Completion Postsecondary Enrollment Kindergarten Enrollment iii. The extent to which the SEA will use funds it reserves to identify and engage 1) students who have missed the most in -person instruction during the 2019 -2020 and 2020 -2021 school years; and 2) students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures . ODE will use the data collected from LEA and public charter school Operational Blueprints for Reentry during the 2019 -20 schoo l year, as well as the weekly instructional model data collected throughout the 2020 -21 school year, to identify students who have missed the most in -person instruction in the 2019 -20 and 2020 -21 school years. 54 ODE will evaluate attendance and enrollment da ta to determine which students did not consistently participate in remote instruction and/or disengaged from instruction altogether. ODE will support LEAs in engaging these students through the provision of summer programming and accelerated instructional opportunities described above. In addition, ODE will evaluate the results from our 2021 pilot of the Student Educational Equity Development (SEED Survey) to determine what supports students themselves have identified as important or needed. ODE will explor e additional data collections that may be necessary. 2. Evidence -Based Summer Learning and Enrichment Programs : Describe how the SEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(f)(2) of the ARP Act (totaling not less than 1 percent of the State's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds ) for evidence -based summer learning and enrichment programs , including those that begin in Summer 2021 , and ensure such programs respond to students' academic, social, emotional , and mental health needs . The description must include: i. A description of the evidence -based programs that address the academic, social, emotional , and mental health needs of students (e.g., providing intensive or high -dosage tutoring, accelerating learning ) the SEA has selected, and the extent to which the SEA will evaluate the impact of those programs ; Oregon has made an unprecedented investment in state dollars to fund summer learning programs to mitigate the immense and disruptive impact of the pandemic on Oregon's children. There are two new state grant programs beginning the summer of 2021: 1. The Summer Learning Initiative invests S196.6 million General Fund and $10 million federal dollars in grant funding to participating LEAs for academic summer school to support high school students facing academic credit loss, summer enrichment programs, and wrap -around child care. These funds provide immediate assistance to help move Oregon's students from pandemic recovery to renewal in the summer of 2021; and 2. The Student Success Act Summer Programs Gran t is a $3 million dollar investment each summer beginning in 2021 for schools that are considered high poverty under Title I -A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; have significant achievement gaps; and have been determined by ODE to require addi tional support and interventions based on school performance. This grant is an on -going state investment in summer learning. These new state funds as well as federally funded grants designed to provide summer learning programs such as: 21st Century Communi ty Learning Centers (21st CCLC) Title IV -B, Migrant Education Programs (MEP) Title I -C, Extended School Year programs (ESY) and the addition of ARP ESSER funds for summer learning have created a once in a generation opportunity to create comprehensive incl usive summer learning experiences for students across Oregon. Summer programs prior to the pandemic were often stand alone programs with minimal 55 braiding of federal dollars and little to no state funding. This summer provides a unique opportunity to create more robust, inclusive programs that leverage federal and state funding streams to provide more opportunities for students to realize unfinished learning and enter the 2021 -22 school year with a sense of belonging and renewal. Funding alone doesn't guar antee the benefits of summer programming for children and youth: quality matters. During the summer of 2021, our schools' highest priority for students must be promoting and supporting their mental health, well -being, and providing learning opportunities grounded in student interests that can ignite and renew engagement, foster learning, and nourish in -person connections. Oregon created the Summer Learning Best Practice Guide and companion document Student Learning: Unfinished, Not Lost as guidance to districts as they develop a variety of summer learning experiences unique to the strengths and needs of their students and communities they serve. This guidance highlights six key evidence -based strategies on designing and implementing a high -quality summer program that are the most critical in supporting our students as they transition back to in -person learning. Six Key Strategies for Summer Learning 1. Elevate Relationships and Enrichment 2. Deepen Comm unity Partnerships 3. Integrate Well Rounded Learning and Work that Matters 4. Promote and Support Mental Health and Well -Being 5. Engage Students and Families 6. Hire Effective Educators and Invest in Professional Learning Oregon's summer learning efforts will be fo cused around these six strategies. Furthermore, school and learning does not exist in isolation, but rather within the broader context of community. All of these supports and relationships are valuable by themselves, but students and families thrive and pr osper when purposeful collaboration and alignment of resources are realized. Meaningful engagement is about co -creation, sharing ownership, breaking down barriers and building bridges. Oregon has created a Summer Learning Collaborative with the purpose of creating an iterative process for meaningful and authentic engagement to inform summer learning programs. These discussions directly apply to out -of-school time as a whole and will help shape our efforts as we work to meet the strengths and needs of our st udents. Program Goals that Elevate Relationships, Enrichment and Well Rounded Learning that Matters During Out -of-School Time The Oregon Department of Education has not yet determined the specific strategies in using ARP ESSER Fund s for Evidence -Based Summer Learning and Enrichment Programs . However, the Department is in the process of establishing a foundation in which the funds create high - quality summer learning programs through the application of evidence -based practice to address unfinished learni ng and increase opportunities that elevate rela tionships, enrichment, and well -rounded learning that matters to students . Some of the early concepts in which ODE 56 will use as a sta rting point in developing specific strategies for ongoing summer programming include : 1. Providing opportunities for academic enrichment and tutorial services to help students, particularly students who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, to meet state performance standards in core academic subjects such as readin g, writing, science and mathematics. 2. Offering students a broad array of additional services, programs and activities, including but not limited to: a) Strengths -based, trauma - and social emotional learning - informed, equity -centered mental health services an d supports; b) cultural and linguistic learning; c) well-rounded youth development activities; d) career and technical education (CTE); e) work -based learning; f) CTE student leadership engagement/activities and postsecondary g) servic e learning; h) arts, music, physical fitness; and i) internship or apprenticeship programs that are designed to reinforce and complement the regular academic program of participating students. 3. Family and community engagement opportunities that support an active and meaningful connection to their children's education which ensure whole family access to additional services, including but not limited to, community -based health, mental health, social services, and other enrichment opportunities. Summer prog rams that run for five weeks or more have shown to be more effective as does consistent student attendance, strong student recruitment efforts, small class sizes, and strong community partnerships. Furthermore, the evidence is clear that keeping programs u p and running for more than one summer or school year is critical to the effectiveness and quality of programming. As mentioned, ODE is currently implementing state legislation and funding for summer programming in 2021. A RP ESSER Funds will be used to further ongoing summer programming efforts and once those have been specifically identified, this plan will be updated. Evidence of Effectiveness and Continuous Quality Improvement ARP ESSER summer programming and afterschool programs will follow the same evidence based programmatic model and continuous quality improvement process as outlined in Student Success Act Summer Program guidance, which focuses on student achievement, closing opportunity gaps, increasing student atten dance, increasing students' sense of belonging, and providing valuable resources and additional support to families. 57 ii. How the evidence -based programs will specifically address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3. i.--viii. When possible, please indicate which data sources the SEA will use to identify students most in need of summer learning and enrichment programs ; and There is broad consensus and evidence that the COVID -19 crisis and school closures have illuminated and exacerbated the structural economic and racial inequities in the education system. Summer planni ng and implementation should prioritize in -person programming, focus on the students most underserved by the system, and proactively seek input from families and students in their language of choice about their wants and needs. Summer learning experiences have the potential to respond to the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 and COVID -19 response efforts on historically underserved communities and those for whom existing systems most marginalize. National evidence suggests summer programs were out of rea ch for nearly 14 million children in 2019. The majority of these children were from families with low incomes. This unmet demand continued and deepened last year throughout the pandemic creating more of a burden for working families. Parents in higher inco me families spend five times as much on summer programs for their children, and are three times more likely to have a child in a summer program than parents of low income families. This exacerbates and increases the gap in opportunities that spark joy, dee pen learning and nourish connections for children. The greatest barriers for families to participate in summer programs are cost, location, transportation, and information about programs. It's been demonstrated that these barriers are greater for low incom e families and families who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. To address the inequities that have been spotlighted and the opportunity gap that has only intensified as a result of the pandemic, the Oregon Department of Education will develop a process to distribute funds to LEAs and educational entities. Since participation in summer learning is voluntary, priority will be given to programs who can effectively demonstrate evidence -based recruitment and comprehensive outreach methods t o actively engage and retain the following student groups: Students from each racial or ethnic group (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by race or ethnicity), Gender (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on unde rserved student groups by gender), English learners, Children with disabilities, Students experiencing homelessness, Children and youth in foster care, 58 Migratory students, Other groups disproportionately impacted by the pandemic that have been identified by the ODE(e.g., youth involved in the criminal justice system, students who have missed the most in -person instruction during the 2019 -2020 and 2020 -2021 school years, students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when off ered during school building closures, and LGBTQ+ students) ARP ESSER Summer programs must be free of charge to students and include transportation to and from the program. To the extent practicable, students should have access to programs that are a reaso nable distance to where they live. iii. The extent to which the SEA will use funds it reserves to identify and engage 1) students who have missed the most in -person instruction during the 2019 -2020 and 2020 -2021 school years; and 2) students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures . ARP ESSER funds for summer learning will require LEAs and other educational entities to identify, create and employ effective outreach strategies to recruit and r etain students into summer learning programs who missed the most in -person instruction and students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction during the school 2020 -21 school year. This could include but is not limited to, hiring an outrea ch coordinator who consistently follows -up and connects with students and families in culturally responsive and student and family - centered ways. Building the necessary relationships that encourage students to engage, feel a sense of belonging and are eage r to participate in summer programs are critical to the success of these programs. One of the key areas we monitor and evaluate is \"who\" attends these programs and if they are engaging for these particular student groups. To be consi dered for any funds all ocated, LEAs and other educational entities will have to explain how they will ensure they are actively reaching out, recruiting and retaining focal students into the program . 3. Evidence -Based Comprehensive Afterschool Programs: Describe how the SEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(f)(3) of the ARP Act (totaling not less than 1 percent of the State's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds ) for evidence -based comprehensive afterschool programs (including, for example , before -school programming) , and ensure such programs respond to students' academic, social, emotional , and mental health needs . The description must include: i. A description of the evidence -based programs (e.g., including partnerships with community -based organizations) the SEA has selected, and the extent to which the SEA will evaluate the impact of those programs ; 59 Much like summer programming, the highest priority for students engaging in afters chool programs in 2021 -2022 must be promoting and supporting their mental health and well -being and providing learning opportunities grounded in student interests. High -quality afterschool programs can provide children and youth with rich opportunities for growth, learning and fun. Research has shown quality after school programs are proven to help young people learn, grow and thrive. Decades of research shows that kids who participate in afterschool: 1) Develop strong social skills, 2) Engage in physical a ctivity 3) Get excited about learning 4) Attend school more often 5) Make gains in reading and math 6) Improve work habits and grades 7) Explore career paths and gain workforce skills 8) Have higher graduation rates. Quality afterschool programs give our students a better shot at filling their spare time with enrichment rather than idleness and risk in the critical times when school is not in session and working families are not home. Afterschool can be a nourishing space narrowing opportunity gaps for our underserved and historically marginalized students that were only exacerbated during the pandemic. Afterschool programs can also be an ideal setting for s tudents to learn and cultivate skills for coping with stress, and building and sustainin g positive social relationships when skilled and trusted adults are there to guide them. The Six Key Strategies for Summer Learning outlined in the previous section directly align and complement Oregon's 21st CCLC comprehensive list of 11 evidence -based elements of quality programming that was created in 2018 from an intensive literature review and community engagement sessions. The 11 elements are described below: 11 Elements of Quality Out -of-School Time Programs (Finn -Stevenson, 2014; Granger, 2010; 1998; Scharf & Woodlief, 2000). 1. Program Administration: A quality program has an effective management that develops and implements policies and procedures to ensure the successful operation of the after school program based on the program goals, vision, and design. 2. Staff Qualifications and Staff Development: High quality afterschool programs recruit, hire, and develop diverse staff members who understand, value, and promote high quality practices. 3. Partnerships: High quality afterschool programs build strong partnerships with families, schools, and the community to enhance the quality of afterschool and youth services 4. Evaluation and Continuous Improvement: High quality after school programs conduct evaluations and continuous improvement for program planning, monitoring and to determine overall program effectiveness. 5. Sustainability: High quality afterschool programs plan for sustainability 6. Diversity, Inclusion, Access, and Equity: High quality afterschool programs e mbrace and value diversity, and have a conscious commitment to helping all youth thrive by providing inclusive, accessible, culturally responsive practices, activities, and opportunities. 7. Physical Environment: High quality afterschool programs provide an a ppropriate, accessible physical environment. 60 8. Safety, Health, and Nutrition: High quality afterschool programs ensure the emotional and the phys ical safety of youth and staff; provide a healthy, welcoming, and accommodating environment; ensure that emergenc y preparedness is a priority; and provide nourishment based on health and wellness standards for children and youth. 9. Interactions and Relationships: High quality afterschool programs provide positive, ongoing connections between and among youth participant s and adults in the program. 10. Youth -Centered: High quality afterschool programs provide youth -centered activities and acts in partnership with youth to foster appropriate youth voice and leadership. 11. Mental Health a nd Social Supports and Active Engagement: High quality afterschool programs encourage active participation and ownership by youth, and offer opportunities for mental health promotion, social support and social skills development. The 11 Elements of Quality Programming are the foundation of the 21st CCLC, Title IV -B, Continuous Quality Improvement Process (CQIP). These 11 elements have been broken into subcategories and captured in a Program Reflection Tool where grantees can assess the extent to which their program practices embody the elements by r anking themselves according to 4 levels of mastery. The Program Reflection Tool is used as a workbook to assess areas of strength, opportunities and to notate opportunities for improvement. At the conclusion of this process, program staff integrate, priori tize and refine improvement goals identified in a formal action plan that is submitted annually as part of the overall improvement process. This process and use of the Program Reflection Tool will focus the design, impleme ntation and continuous quality improvement efforts of ARP ESSER funds for summer learning, afterschool programs, SSA Summer Programs and 21st CCLC programs. This cohesive concept system will enable the state to leverage state and federal dollars to build a comprehensive technical assistanc e program focused on increasing the quality of programs that can be sustained through other programs after ARP ESSER funds are no longer available. Program Goals that Elevate Relationships, Enrichment and Well Rounded Learning that Matters During Out -of-School Time The Oregon Department of Education has not yet determined the specific strategies in using ARP ESSER Funds for Evidence -Based After School Programs. However, the Department is in the process of establishing a foundation in which the funds create high -quality out -of-school programs through the application of evidence -based practice to address unfinished learning and increase opportunities that elevate rela tionships, enrichment, and well -rounded learning that matters to students Some of the early c oncepts in which ODE will use as a starting point in developing specific strategies for after school programs include : 1. Providing opportunities for academic enrichment and tutorial services to help students, particularly students who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, to meet state performance standards in core academic subjects such as reading, writing, science and mathematics. 2. Offering students a broad array of additional services, programs and activities, including but not limited to: 61 a) Strengths -based, trauma - and social emotional learning - informed, equity -centered mental health services and supports; b) cultural and linguistic learning; c) well-rounded youth development activities; d) career and technical education (CTE); e) work -based learning; f) CTE student leadership organizations (CTSO) engagement/activities and postsecondary preparation; g) service learning; h) arts, music, physical fitness; and i) internship or apprenticeship programs that are designed to reinforce and complement the regular academic program of participating students. 3. Family and community engagement opportunities that support an active and meaningful connection to their children's education which ensure whole family access to additional services, including but not limited to, community -based health, mental health, social services, and other enrichment opportunities. Once ODE has identified its specific strategies for Evidence -Based After School Programs, this plan will be updated. ii. How the evidence -based programs will specifically address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3.i.-viii. When possible, please indicate which data sources the SEA will use to identify students most in need of comprehensive afterschool programming; and There is broad consensus and evidence that the COVID -19 crisis and school closures have illuminated and exacerbated the structural economic and racial inequities in the education system. Afterschool planning and implementation should prioritize in -person programming, focus on the students most underserved by the system, and proactively seek input from families and students in their language of choice about their wants and needs. Afterschool learning experiences have the potential to respond to the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 and COVID -19 response efforts on historically underserved communities and those for whom existing systems most marginalize. To best address t he inequities that have been spotlighted and the opportunity gap that has only intensified as a result of the pandemic, the Oregon Department of Education will develop a funding process. Since participation in afterschool programming is voluntary, priority will be given to programs who can effectively demonstrate evidence -based recruitment and comprehensive outreach methods to actively engage and retain the following student groups: 62 Students from each racial or ethnic group (e.g., identifying disparities an d focusing on underserved student groups by race or ethnicity), Gender (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by gender), English learners, Children with disabilities, Students experiencing homelessness, Children and youth in foster care, Migratory students, Other groups disproportionately impacted by the pandemic that have been identified by the SEA (e.g., youth involved in the criminal justice system, students who have missed the most in -person instruction during th e 2019 -2020 and 2020 -2021 school years, students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures, and LGBTQ+ students) ARP ESSER Summer programs must be free of charge to students and include transpo rtation to and from the program. To the extent practicable, students should have access to programs that are a reasona ble distance to where they live. iii. the extent to which the SEA will use funds it reserves to identify and engage 1) students who have missed the most in -person instruction during the 2019 -2020 and 2020 -2021 school years; and 2) students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures . ARP ESSER afterschool programs will require LEAs and other educational partners to identify, create and employ effective outreach strategies to recruit and retain students into the programs who missed the most in -person instruction and students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction during the school 2020 -21 school year. This could include but is not limited to, hiring an outreach coordinator who consistently follows -up and connects with students and families in culturally responsive and student and family -centered ways. Building the necessary relationships that encourage students to engage, feel a sense of belonging and are eager to participate are critical to the success of these programs. 4. Emergency Needs: If the SEA plans to reserve funds for emergency needs under section 2001(f)(4 ) of the AR P Act to address issues responding to the COVID -19 pandemic , describe the anticipated use of those funds, including the extent to which these funds will build SEA and LEA capacity to ensure students' and staff's health and safety ; to meet students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs ; and to use ARP ESSER funds to implement evidence -based interventions . As stated in section C2, ODE is still coordinating with state leaders on the final designation of these funds. At this time, the Department is proposing to reserve funds for emergencies related to the COVID -19 pandemic and deploy them through three strate gies: 1) Addressing Funding Gaps for Public Schools and Local Education Agencies, 2) Specialized Education Services 63 for Vulnerable Populations, and 3) Technical Assistance for Emergency Planning. These strategies will help districts meet the social, emotio nal, mental health, and academic needs of their students with the intent to target those students most vulnerable to disruptions in learning in the event that in -person education is unable to continue. The types of anticipated emergencies include outbreaks at local school districts requiring the school district to stop in -person learning and pivot to distance learning. Additionally, anticipated emergencies include concurrent natural disasters that have a compounding deleterious effect on the mental health of students. These additional disasters can include wildfires, ice storms and other severe weather events that damage homes and buildings. In the summer of 2020, Oregon experienced historically destructive wildfires which compounded the disruption to student learning and well -being already caused by CODIV -19. For this reason, concurrent emergencies are interwoven through the strategies below to maximize LEA readiness and minimize disruption to student well -being in the event of COVID -19 outbreaks and other simultaneous emergencies. These emergencies affect all students in the state, including students in alternative education environments, such as youth correctional or detention facilities, hospitals, or early learning centers. Strategy 1 - Address ing Funding Gaps for Public Schools and Local Education Agencies The first strategy from the SEA set -aside for emergency needs is to fill funding gaps for three school groups that would not otherwise receive adequate funding through the 90% funding formula identified in the law. ODE awarded $1,620,000 to 18 LEAs that would either receive zero funding due to being non-eligible for Title I funds, or would receive less than $90,000 under the 90% formula. This ensured all LEAs in Oregon received a minimum of $ 90,000 under ESSER III to support the schools, teachers, and students in various areas of the state. ODE awarded $2,459,148 to three LEAs as pass -through grants to support the four State Sponsored Charter Schools which are not supported directly by the LEA . These schools receive funding directed by the state that pass -through their home LEA. The Oregon School for the Deaf has been awarded $75 3,750 to enable support for the teachers and 120 hearing impaired students served by the school. OSD receives funding directly from the state. The State Sponsored Charter Schools and the Oregon School for the Deaf were awarded funding based on the same formula used to calculate the 90% LEA awards. This funding will allow all schools in Oregon to utilize the framework OD E has described in this application to address students' and staff's health and safety needs, as well as aiding schools to address academic, social, emotional and mental health needs. A total of $4,832,898 from the SEA emergency needs set -aside was allocat ed for this purpose. Strategy 2 - Specialized Education Services for Vulnerable Populations In evaluating the remaining emergency needs set -aside, ODE is proposing to utilize funding for LEAs and Education Service Districts (ESDs) that provide direct spe cialized education services to vulnerable populations. LEAs and ESDs currently provide services in their district or region as 64 described in the table below, which directly support these students' specialized needs across Oregon. Program # of Students # of LEAs # of ESDs Juvenile Detention Education Program 147 6 4 Youth Corrections Education Program 307 3 3 Long -Term Care and Treatment Program 995 15 6 Hospitals Program 302 0 3 Early Intervention and Early Childhood Special Education Program 14,694 1 8 Regional Programs 11,946 1 7 In the case of a local increase in COVID -19 cases or other emergencies which dramatically impacts the ability for safe in -person school operations, these LEAs and ESDs would provide additional support to ensure a continuity of learning for these vulnerable students. The grant funds could be used to provide targeted additional resources to help LEAs and ESDs meet student and community needs, including but not limited to: Supporting families, students, and staff that may be displaced or severely impacted by multiple, concurrent emergencies whose responses are complicated by CODIV -19 (i.e wildfires.) Adapting school models and operations to prioritize and ensure access for students who may be disproportionately impacte d by COVID -19. Providing adequate infrastructure and/or services that enable internet access and connectivity for student learning. Providing appropriate, user friendly, and accessible devices for all students and teachers to participate in online learning . Identifying and providing high quality, adaptable, culturally responsive, and effective digital learning curricula, digital tools and content that fosters student learning and engagement. Providing and/or maintaining online technology such as Learning Ma nagement Systems that allows educators to successfully deliver their teaching content and lessons Support staffing and operational needs related to a rapid shift to distance learning include nutrition services, mental health services for families, students and staff, device distribution, transportation, and communications. Provide funding for programs where revenues were impacted by the pandemic to ensure continued services. 65 Strategy 3 - Technical Assistance for Emergency Planning These funds will be pr oposed as targeted technical assistance to support LEAs in responding to the impacts of COVID. The funding would be provided as grants to ESDs or other Community Based Organizations to support LEAs in leveraging their local ARP ESSER dollars for emergenc y planning, preparation and response to COVID -19 outbreaks, and concurrent emergencies. Many LEAs in Oregon are very small and have already developed relationships with their regional ESDs to assist them in planning and for administration in areas identifi ed by the LEA. This area of need is even more exacerbated in emergencies where these LEAs don't have the capacity to manage emergency planning and implementation and rely even more on their established relationships with ESDs. This additional technical ass istance could increase the capacity of LEAs to respond to any changes in the pandemic by creating high quality emergency operations plans that follow federal, state, and local guidelines. This assistance could include: Providing additional funding to curre nt ODE School Safety and Emergency Management trainers and programs. Ensuring LEAs are applying an equity lens to emergency planning with a recognition that COVID -19 and other concurrent emergencies have had disproportionate negative impacts on certain communities, as have previous responses to those emergencies. Supporting LEAs in reflecting and evaluating lessons learned from this previous year and incorporating those data into current Emergency Operations Plans. Improving coordination between schools , LEAs, and local agencies including LHPAs in anticipation of future COVID -19 outbreaks. Supporting LEAs in planning to support the social, emotional, and mental health needs of students and families Ensuring strategic allocation of local ESSER funds to an ticipate operational needs in the case of local outbreaks. E. Supporting LEAs in Planning for and Meeting Students' Needs The Department recognizes that the safe return to in -person instruction must be accompanied by a focus on meeting students ' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs, and by addressing the opportunity gaps that existed before - and were exacerbated by - the pandemic. In this section, SEAs will describe how they will support their LEAs in developing high -quality plans for LEAs' use of ARP ESSER funds to achieve these objectives. 1. LEA Plans for the Use of ARP ESSER Funds : Describe what the SEA will require its LEAs to include in LEA plans consistent with the ARP ESSER requirements for the use of ARP ESSER funds , how the SEA will require such plans to be made available to the public , and the deadline by which the LEA must submit its ARP ESSER plan (which must be a reasonable timeline and should be within no later than 90 days after receiving its ARP ESSER allocati on). The LEA plans must include, at a minimum: 66 Oregon's Approach to Meeting LEA Planning Requirements With the passage of House Bill 3427 , the Student Success Act (SSA) was established in Oregon in 2019. The Oregon Department of Education (ODE) has been implementing this robust state law, which is deeply aligned with the g oals, priorities, focal student groups, and public plan accountabilities required by ARP ESSER funding. The Student Investment Account (SIA) which is part of the SSA has two main aims: 1) to support students' mental and behavioral health needs and 2) to increase academic achievement and reduce academic disparities for focal student groups that include emerging bilingual students; students of color; special education students; students navigating poverty, homelessness, and foster care; and any other studen ts who have historically experienced academic disparities as determined by the State Board of Education. Through the SIA, LEAs are eligible to receive noncompetitive grant funds if they meet application requirements, which are provided in the comprehensive Guidance for Eligible Applicants . Requirements include evidence of ongoing and authentic community engagement, application of an equity lens, and develo pment of a three - year SIA plan and budget. ODE asserts that many of the desired requirements for LEAs are sufficiently met through the implementation of the SIA. ODE proposes alignment in practice and program implementation to streamline administrative pr ocesses, while also seeking maximum coordination in terms of outcomes for students, families, and schools. LEAs would provide additional, supplemental information not already captured by the SIA that is needed to meet ARP ESSER requirements as detailed bel ow. As directed by USED, at least 90% of the ARP ESSER Funds flow directly to LEAs with the initial allocation of funds having taken place on May 24, 2021. ODE's plan is to have LEAs in Oregon meet the planning requirements set forth here no later than Au gust 22, 2021. The outline of the existing architecture of the Student Investment Account (SIA) implementation is provided as part of this plan, given ODE's proposal. The following table maps this information: Requirement for LEA Plans for Use of ARP ESSER Funds Requirements for LEAs that Submitted a Student Investment Account (SIA) Plan Supplemental information LEA's would be required to submit to address ARP ESSER funding requirements not already covered by the SIA. Community engagement, with a focus on focal student groups: LEAs with an approved SIA plan have met the requirement for community engagement by submitting narrative responses and LEAs will need t o submit an additional narrative response to how they've engaged with: 67 Low-income families, Students of color, English learners, Children with disabilities, Students experiencing homelessness, Children and youth in foster care, Migratory students Children who are incarcerated artifacts of engagement for the following focal student groups: Low-income families, Students of color English learners, Children with disabilities, Students experiencing homelessness, Children and youth in foster care LEAs are continuing to engage with their communities for input on SIA plan priorities to inform plan updates due by June 30, 2021, which is also a requirement of ESSER. Migratory students Children who are incarcerated LEAs to use evidence - based practices or practices with an emerging evidence -base LEAs with an approved SIA plan have met this requirement through use of the Quality Educational Model (QEM) to inform SIA plan development. LEAs will be invited to share and utilize information from the What Works Clearinghouse. Application of an equity lens LEAs with an approved SIA plan have met this requirement by uploading and providing a narrative response to how the equity lens was applied to SIA plan development. LEAs will assure the utilization of the equity lens they've already been using to determine new uses of ARP ESSER funds. Public posting and comment LEAs with an approved SIA plan have met this ESSER requirement to gather input from the community to inform how funding is spent to support student's social, emotional, and mental health needs. LEAs took the following steps with their SIA plan that include d information about how community engagement informed the application and plan development as well as how LEAs Supplemental information covering ARP ESSER requiremen ts will be posted alongside existing SIA information, meeting the same standards and requirements. 68 will support student's mental and behavioral health: 1. Posting the SIA application, plan, and budget to the website and having a copy available in the main office 2. Presenting the application, plan, and budget at an open meeting with the opportunity for public comment 3. Having the application, plan, and budget approved by the governing board LEAs are continuing to engage with their communities for inp ut on SIA plan priorities, including how to meet student's mental and behavioral health needs amidst COVID, to support plan updates that would also incorporate ESSER requirements, due by June 30, 2021. Department review LEAs with an approved SIA plan have already had the SIA plan reviewed by at least two ODE staff members. Staff determined if the SIA application, plan, and budget met requirements or did not meet requirements based on guidance in Section 3 of the December 2019 guidance. Additional planning and supplemental information that is submitted to ODE meet ARP ESSER requirements would get similar departmental review (eg, meeting CDC requirements). Mental and behavioral health needs of all students LEAs with an approved SIA plan, or amended plan in light of the impacts of COVID and/or SIA funding reduction, have already met this requirement by identifying which activi ties would support student's health and safety as well as providing narrative responses to how planned activities and LEAs will be asked for any additional supplemental information needed 69 strategies would meet student's mental and behavioral health needs in the original application. LEAs are currently submitting plan updates where there is an optional question where they can identify how they've prioritized spending to meet student's mental and behavioral health needs amidst COVID and funding reductions. ODE currently captures information from LEAs for the SIA application, plan, and budget through Smartsheet. The additional information needed in order to meet all ARP ESSER requirements could also be collected via the Smartsheet platform to be integrated w ith SIA components. This would allow for sharing of information across ODE offices, such as the Office of Teaching, Learning, and Assessment, to ensure that all requirements for the ARP ESSER are met by all LEAs. Only three LEA's in Oregon are not current ly participating in the SIA program. For those three LEAs the following planning will be required: 1. LEAs that have not submitted a SIA plan will need to submit a narrative response to how they've engaged with: o Low-income families, o Students of color, o English learners, o Children with disabilities, o Students experiencing homelessness, o Children and youth in foster care, o Migratory students o Children who are incarcerated 2. LEAs that have not submitted an SIA plan will need to submit an assurance that they have considered Oregon's Quality Educational Model (QEM) or other relevant evidence - based practices from the Wha t Works Clearinghouse . 3. LEAs that have not submitted a SIA plan will need to submit a copy of the equity lens they are applying to their planned used for ARP ESSER funds. 4. LEAs that have not submitted a SIA plan will need to submit an assurance that they've taken the following steps: o Posted the plan for their ARP ESSER funds to the LEA website o Presented the plan for their ARP ESSER funds at a local, public meeting with the opportunity for public comment 70 5. LEAs that have not submitted a SIA plan will need to submit a narrative response that identifies how they will meet the social, emotional, and mental health needs of all students. ODE will review the information and assurances submitted by LEAs that have not submitted an SIA plan for meeting ARP ESSER requi rements. i. The extent to which and how the funds will be used to implement prevention and mitigation strategies that are, to the greatest extent practicable, in line with the most recent CDC guidance, in order to continuously and safely operate schools for in-person learning ; Funds used to implement prevention and mitigation strategies to safely operate in -person learning To continuously and safely operate schools for in -person learning, LEAs would need to continue to implement a qualified LEA Plan for Safe Return to In -Person Instruction and Continuity of Services, as required under ESSER. In implementing these plans, it is anticipated LEAs will utilize funding to support efforts to ensure safe reopening of schools and quality ongoing student learning. This includes, but is not limited to, expenditures for facility improvement that enable social distancing of students and educators; upgrades of ventilation systems that effectively reduce the risk of exposure to COVID -19; purchase of PPE that enables safety for teachers and staff as they operate through in person learning; and as necessary, acquisition of goods and service to ensure ongoing distance learning. In addition, LEAs must meet Oregon laws and procedures related to health and safety requirements in school settings. See Section B for additional information. ii. How the LEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(e)(1) of the ARP Act (totaling not less than 20 percent of the LEA's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds) to address the academic imp act of lost instructional time through the implementation of evidence -based interventions, such as summer learning or summer enrichment, extended day, comprehensive afterschool programs, or extended school year programs; Focusing on unfinished learning t hrough instruction, evidence -based practices, and enrichment As outlined in Section D, ODE has identified key areas of potential instructional focus while recognizing that we don't have enough information, yet, to determine a fixed approach that will best address the range of strengths and impacts on student learning experienced across Oregon. ODE will be asking LEAs for supplemental information about their specific instructional approaches to address unfinished learning as defined in Oregon. ODE will move through engagement, planning, and data collection processes to fur ther refine and share instructional 71 approaches that LEAs can use with specific attention to strategies that might best mitigate disproportionate impacts amongst focal student groups. ODE has also shared the Summer Learning Best Practice Guide to suppo rt LEAs with implementation of enrichment programs, including summer learning and programming. iii. How the LEA will spend its remaining ARP ESSER funds consistent with section 2001(e )(2) of the ARP Act ; and iv. How the LEA will ensure that the interventions it implements , including but not limited to the interventions under section 2001(e)(1) of the ARP Act to address the academic impact of lost instructional time , will respond to the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of all students, and particularly those students disproportionately impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic, including students from low -income f amilies, students of color, English learners, children with disabilities, students experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, and migratory students. Spending within allowable uses and ensuring LEA planning addresses the students experi ence disproportionate impact LEAs will be required to report on the programmatic usage of funds, to support the LEAs in sharing with ODE how the investment is having an impact on lost instructional time or unfinished learning, with a particular emphasis on how the activities being implemented are supporting students being disproportionately impacted by COVID -19. ODE will review programmatic reports to ensure the spending is allowable and consistent with the intent of ARP ESSER funds to address the academic impact of lost instructional time. Additionally, LEAs will be required to submit financial reports, which is detailed in Section G. 2. LEA Consultation: Describe how the SEA will, in planning for the use of ARP ESSER funds, ensure that , consistent with the ARP ESSER requirements ], its LEAs engage in meaningful consultation with stakeholders, including, but not limited to: i. students; ii. families; iii. school and district administrators (including special education administrators); and iv. teachers, p rincipals, school leaders, other educators, school staff, and their unions . One of the most significant and clearest opportunities for coordination with the requirements for ARP ESSER funds is to directly align them to the community engagement and consultation requirements already established and being supported in Oregon through the implementation 72 of the Student Investment Account. From Fall 2019 - Summer 2020, LEAs in Oregon substantively engaged their communities (particularly their most underserved communities) as part of the development of their SIA plans. All SIA plans requir ed local governing board approval with opportunities for public comment. The opportunity for this level of community engagement has been lauded by Community -Based Organizations (CBOs), education partners, and the Oregon State Board of Education for its sig nificant change to how districts engage their communities. Many of the relationships built through these engagements created conditions for closer family relationships during COVID -19 responses and Comprehensive Distance Learning. Additionally, LEAs are cu rrently in the process of engaging with students, families, and communities to inform SIA Plan Updates, which are due to ODE by June 30, 2021. In April 2021, ODE released a new Community Engagement Toolkit , which provides a framework for deepening community engagement practices. ODE will use this toolkit to g uide technical assistance and coaching to LEAs over the next five years. The toolkit, which is adapted from the Movem ent Strategy Center and Facilitating Power , takes lessons learned from the first SIA application cycle to support the development of a spectrum that names different levels of engagement practices from ignore (level 0), inform (level 1), consult (level 2), involve (level 3), collaborate (level 4), to defer (level 5). The toolkit includes key strategies to move across the levels and articulates a form of community engagement that is robust and beyond what is merely required in statute. The LEA must also engag e in meaningful consultation with each of the following to the extent present in or served by the LEA: i. Tribes; ii. civil rights organizations (including disability rights organizations); and iii. stakeholders representing the interests of children with disabilitie s, English learners, children experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, migratory students, children who are incarcerated, and other underserved students. The description must also include how the SEA will ensure that LEAs provide the public the opportunity to provide input in the development of the LEA's plan for the use of ARP ESSER funds and take such input into account. ODE's Tribal Consultation Toolkit is an equally important resource. Taken together, and if approved, ODE would leverage these resources to support and guide LEAs in engagement and consultation in the use of ARP ESSER funds while making meaningful alignment and connections with existing efforts so these resources and processes strengthen rather than strain community and educational response efforts. In that same spirit, ODE continues to work to align broader federal school improvement processes with other state programs, including the SIA. This alignment work seeks to support districts to a simplified and higher quality avenue for strategic planning, implementation, and high -integrity and high -context accountability process as outlined in Oregon's ESSA Plan . 73 This kind of coordination is the right direction for the state, regardless of ARP ESSER funding, and will be a work in progress over the next four years. The state of Oregon sees significant opportunities to align several federal and state programs and resources to make a concerted effort to not just make a full recove ry from pandemic impacts, bu t to leverage recovery efforts to shape a future with a stronger and more coherent educational system that leads to meaningful learning opportunities each and every day for each and every student in the state. As named in the table in section E.1. ODE will require LEAs who submitted an SIA plan to submit a supplemental narrative response to share how they've engaged with student groups named in ESSER that do not overlap with those named in the SIA. LEAs that didn't submit an S IA plan will need to submit a narrative response as to how all of the ESSER required focal student groups have been engaged. ODE will follow -up with LEAs to ensure that engagement with the focal student groups has occurred. 3. Describe how the SEA will suppo rt and monitor its LEA s in using ARP ESSER funds. The description must include: v. How the SEA will support and monitor its LEAs' implementation of evidence -based interventions that respond to students' academic, social, emotional , and mental health needs , such as through summer learning or summer enrichment, extended day, comprehensive afterschool programs, or extended school year programs - including the extent to which the SEA will collect evidence of the effectiveness of interventions employed; vi. How th e SEA will support and monitor its LEAs in specifically addressing the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3.i.-viii; and A Sustainable Approach to Monit oring and Evaluation The monitoring and evaluation infrastructure that is being put in place for SIA implementation again offers a sustainable avenue for being both accountable to and supporting the system learning and capacity building needed to consider the impacts of ARP ESSER Funding. ODE created a \" Common and Customized \" monitoring and evaluation framework for the SIA. Within this framework, there are three components: 1) Longitudinal Performance Growth Targets (LPGTs), 2) progress markers, and 3) local optional metrics. LEAs are required to co -develop LPGTs for five common metrics - regular attendance, third grade reading, ninth grade on -track, four y ear graduation, and five year completion. In the fall of 2019, ODE provided LEAs with suppressed (data will not show if number of students is too low and there risk of students being personally identified) and unsuppressed data for the five common metrics over the past five years as an input to their application development as well as to inform their initial drafts of the LPGTs. As part of the LPGTs, LEAs are required to establish baseline targets, the minimum expectations for progress; stretch targets, an ambitious 74 achievement target that is realistic and represents significant improvements in either raising academic achievement or reducing academic disparities; and gap closing targets, targets set to monitor the reduction of academic disparities between s tudents, especially focal student groups. While in the initial application cycle, LEAs submitted draft targets; ultimately in response to the impacts of COVID -19, the Oregon Legislature released the requirement of LPGTs during the August 2020 special session, meaning that LEAs were not required to develop LPGTs for the 2020 -2021 school year. ODE is currently exploring what the LPGTs will look like for the 2021 - 2022 school year given the challenges in collecting data during the 2020 -2021 school year. When LEAs are required to develop and track LPGTs, these targets could be used to support LEAs with disaggregating impact by subgroups for the five common metrics. Additionally, the framework includes a set of progress markers, which illuminate the depth and complexity of changes that advance over time. Moving from early and expected changes, towards likely changes; and then extending all the way toward profound changes desired based on the efforts of LEAs. Initially, pre -COVID -19, ODE convened staff, LEA leadership, and ESDs to develop progress markers for each of the five common metrics. However, in the midst of the pandemic, ODE consolidated the progress markers into a set of 15 general progress markers . The final set of progress markers were included in the LEAs' grant agreements and LEAs are currently naming the changes and shifts in behavior that they are seeing in their quarterly programmatic progress repor ts. If ODE's proposed direction for this ESSER plan is approved by USED, a review would be completed to see what, if any, progress markers might be added to charter early impacts and progress from the kinds of activities ARP ESSER funding allows. It is worth noting that within the customized SIA framework, LEAs also have the ability to create local optional metrics, which could be additional metrics or progress markers that they want to track. Given one of the aims of the SIA is to meet students' mental and behavioral health needs, local optional metrics could include results from surveys such as the Student Health Survey, Youth Truth, or the Student Educational Equity Development Survey (SEEDS ). At this time, ODE anticipates the Oregon Legislature will pass House Bill 20 60A, which strengthens the Student Success Act. Specifically, the new bill names that in addition to the required LPGTs, LEAs may establish targets related to student mental and behavioral health needs, as established by rule by the State Board of Educatio n which again neatly aligns to the aims in ARP ESSER requirements. LEAs have significant annual reporting requirements as well as four -year performance review requirements within SIA implementation. To support transparency and public accountability for the spending of funds, these reports on progress must be posted to the LEAs' website and available in the main office; presented at a local public meeting with the opportunity for public 75 comment; and approved by the governing board before being submitted to ODE. ODE will receive the first annual reports from LEAs on August 30, 2021 unless the LEA requested a summer extension to expend SIA funds through September 30, 2021. About 70% of LEAs requested a summer extension, so the majority of annual reports are ex pected to be submitted by November 30, 2021. LEAs will need to complete their first four -year performance review no later than spring of 2024. If approved, ODE would utilize the SIA monitoring processes - including approach to data, progress markers, annu al reports, and strenuous application review with attention to focal student groups - provides the kind of rigor needed to attend to disproportionate impacts - as the avenue to meet ARP -ESSER requirements while collecting additional, supplemental informati on as needed and outlined. vii. How the SEA will support and monitor its LEAs in using ARP ESSER funds to identify, reengage, and support students most likely to have experienced the impact of lost instructional time on student learning, such as: a. Students who have missed the most in -person instruction during the 2019 -2020 and 2020 -2021 school years; b. Students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures; and c. Students most at -risk of droppi ng out of school. Additional Attention is Needed with ARP ESSER Monitoring ODE would work to create supplemental information that needs to be submitted by LEAs to address how ESSER funds are supporting: Students who have missed the most in -person instru ction during the 2019 -2020 and 2020 -2021 school years; Students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures; and Students most at -risk of dropping out of school. ODE anticipates doing this with the same supplemental narrative process described above and would also look to gather asset based information to learn more about what was gained and where strength, resilience, or knowledge was leveraged or built in response to COVID -19 challenges. The supplemental information could be submitted via the current SIA mechanisms in place. LEAs submit an annual performance update which details learning and impacts of the investment via Smartsheet. ODE could add additional items to support monitoring of how ARP ESSER funds were utilized at this time in alignment with the supplemental information described in this section. 76 4. Describe the extent to which the SEA will support its LEAs in implementing additional strategies for taking educational equity into account in expending ARP ESSER funds Including but not limited to: viii. Allocating funding both to schools and for districtwide activities based on student need, and ix. Implementing an equitable and inclusive return to in -person instruction. An inclusive return to in -person instruction includes, but is not limited to, establishing policies and practices that avoid the over-use of exclusionary discipline measures (including in - and out - of-school suspensions) and creating a positive and supportive learning environment for all students . Oregon is Committed to Advancing Educational Equity ODE's commitment to equity is widespread throughout all agency initiatives, including state and federal programs beyond the SIA. On May 12, 2021, ODE launched the Agency Equity Strategic Plan that will guide the agency for the next five years. This plan emerges from the work and desires of O DE staff, leadership and community partners. It is intentionally constructed to increase internal cultural, and structural capacity, in the hopes of continual movement toward transformational change. This change will allow ODE to more consistently and effe ctively address historical and contemporary patterns of neglect and oppression, and meaningfully contribute to success outcomes in Oregon's school systems. Another key benefit for integrating ARP ESSER planning and implementation with the Student Investm ent Account in Oregon is the shared focus on advancing educational equity. Again, LEAs - and therefore students, educators, and communities - can realize the benefit of a coordinated planning process by building and strengthening system -wide work already u nderway while benefiting from the additional resources put forward in ARP ESSER. The following processes and commitments already exist: As mentioned above, meaningful and ongoing community engagement is at the center of the SIA. Starting in the fall of 201 9 and leading up to the initial development of the SIA plan and submission of an application in spring of 2020, LEAs were required to engage with their students, families, staff, tribal nations, and communities, with a focus on student groups outlined in t he Oregon statutes governing SIA . LEAs are applying an equity lens as they consider all of the input that comes from their overall improvement planning, evidence -base review, data review, and community engagement as they develop plans that meet their stud ents' mental and behavioral health needs and increase academic achievement for students who have historically experienced academic disparities. ODE provided a number of tools to LEAs, including the Oregon Equity Lens as well as a suite of Decision Tools , which could be use d to support their decision -making process and focus on advancing education equity in their district 77 or school. In reviewing SIA applications, ODE found that over 44% of applicants used the Oregon Equity Lens, while another 20% of applicants used their own equity lens or tool when processing input from the community to develop their SIA plans. ODE will continue to support and coach LEAs in applying an equity lens and using the new Community Engagement Toolkit, as mentioned above, to support robust and equit y- centered engagement efforts, decision -making, and plan development. The Student Success Act also establishes three technical assistance and coaching elements that are directly connected with the Student Investment Account and which could also support t he ARP ESSER focus on meeting students' social, emotional, and mental health needs, while also focusing particularly on those students most disproportionately impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. ODE is naming these three supports given the close connection of the SIA to the ARP ESSER plan, but this list of supports is not inclusive of all of the coaching structures that exist across offices and programs at ODE. o Education Service Districts (ESDs) : Section 25 of the Student Success Act establishes that ESDs receive funding based on a formula to support LEAs in their regions with SIA plan development, implementation, and evaluation. As part of the ESD funds, each r egion has at least a 0.25 FTE SSA Liaison who supports their LEAs and also connects with ODE staff on a biweekly basis. o Intervention and Strengthening Program (ISP) : In addition to the general technical assistance ESDs and ODE provide, Section 17 of the Act also establishes the ISP for grant recipients that do not meet Longitudinal Performance Growth Targets (LPGTs). After taking information submitted by the LEA as to why LPGTs were not met into consideration, ODE may require the LEA to enter into the ISP for a minimum one -year commitment. Under the program, the department shall advise and counsel grant recipients on how to meet performance growth targets and shall assist grant recipients with ongoing professional development and peer collaboration. As par t of the ISP, ODE will be contracting with vendors to provide coaching in different focal areas, one area being coaching that supports LEAs to create equitable education systems, which aligns closely with goals of the ESSER funding. o Intensive Coaching Program (ICP) : Section 18 of the statute establishes the ICP which is at least a four year commitment for a handful of invited LEAs. The ICP establishes Student Success Teams (SST), which are composed of LEA staff, ODE staff, and community members and work s to develop an SIA plan for the LEAs regular SIA funds as well as the additional funds that are received by the LEA for participating in the program. The following ODE initiatives are also closely aligned and intersect with ARP ESSER implementation goals: 78 Every Student Belongs : The E very Student Belongs rule prohibits hate symbols, specifically three of the most recognizable symbols of hate in the U.S. \u2014the swastika (outside of a religious context), the Confederate flag, and the noose. The temporary rule took effect on September 18, 2020. It requires LEAs to adopt and implement policies and procedures that prohibit the use or display of the noose, swastika, or confederate flag in any program or school -sponsored activity except where used in teaching curricula that are aligned with the Oregon State Standards by January 1, 2021. HB 2697 was intro duced in the Oregon Legislature in the 2021 session. The bill codifies the prohibition of hate symbols on school property or education programs. HB 2697 passed and was signed into law by Governor Kate Brown on June 3, 2021. The bill is effective January 1, 2022. Integrated Model of Mental Health : This model was created to assist school communities in promoting the mental health and well -being of school communities. Mental health promotion celebrates the unique qualities and ways of being and knowing that each person, family, and group bring to the school community, and is supported by four, equally necessary, interconnected pill ars of practice: trauma - informed care, social emotional learning, racial equity, and strengths -focused, multi - tiered systems of support. Tribal History/Shared History : In 2017, the Oregon Legislature enacted Senate Bill (SB) 13, now known as Tribal History/Shared History. Through this law, the Office of Indian Education is creating K -12 Native American Curricul um for inclusion in Oregon public schools and provides professional development to educators. The law also directs the ODE to provide funds to each of the nine federally recognized tribes in Oregon to create individual place -based curriculum. Emerging Bilingual and English Language Learner School and District Improvement : House Bill (HB) 3499 directs the ODE to develop and implement a statewide education plan for English Language Learners who are in our K -12 education system. The plan will address disparities experienced by English Language Learners in every indicator of academic success, from the historical practices leading to disprop ortionate outcomes for the students to the educational needs of the students from K -12 education, by examining and applying culturally appropriate best practices. Supporting Ethnic Studies Instruction : In 2017 the Oregon Legislative Assembly adopted House Bill 2845 calling for the identification and creation of Ethnic Studies instruction for students in kindergarten through grade 12 relating to social science standards. School Safety and Prevention System : Section 36 of the Student Success Act calls for the development of a state -wide School Safety and Prevention System. The System is designed to provide LEAs with a multi -tiered system of supports ranging from curriculum -based universal prevention programs, to safety -based crisis int erventions. These offerings include suicide prevention services, behavioral safety assessments, access to the SafeOregon Tip Line, and positive school culture and climate support that 79 includes programs to prevent bullying, cyberbullying, harassment, and in timidation, and to promote mental health and well -being in school districts statewide. Adi's Act: Suicide Prevention, Intervention, and Post -vention : Senate Bill 52, also known as Adi's Act, requires Oregon LEAs to develop comprehensive district Student Suicide Prevention Plans. These Plans are to include procedural planning, equity and racial equity -centered supports, and a staff training process that explicitly addresses when and how students and families are referred to appropriate mental health and crisis services. Adi's Act operates in conjunction with the Student Success Act to ensure tha t LGBTQ2SIA+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/non -binary, queer/questioning, two - spirit, intersex, asexual, and the myriad other ways to describe gender identities) youth, foster youth, youth with disabilities, BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of C olor) and tribal communities/members/students and historically and currently underserved youth receive equitable access to services and support. Equitable and inclusive return to in -person instruction Oregon's Governor through executive order on March 5, 2 021 directed all LEAs to \"return to the learning environment we know serves [students] best: in -person instruction.\" Since that time all LEAs in Oregon that provided in person instruction prior to the pandemic have returned to in -person instruction. As di scussed in section A1, Oregon issued Ready Schools, Safe Learners Guidance (see Appendix E) to support LEAs and students during the pandemic. This guidance was updated upon issuance of the Governor's executive order to return in -person instruction and continued to center equity as one of the guiding principles. ODE has previously been working to establish policies and practices that avoid the over -use of exclusionary discipline measures (EDM) (including in - and out -of-school suspensions) and creating a positive and supportive learning environment for all students. ODE provides guidance for LEA's in addressing School Discipline, Bullying, Restraint and Seclusion . Towards these aims, there are also several dedicated advisory gr oups that attend to focal student groups and have developed robust plans for the state, each of which includes strategies for addressing disproportionate discipline. Examples include the American Indian/Alaska Native Student Success Plan , the African American/Black Student Success Plan , the Latino/a/x and Indigenous Student Success Plan (adopted May 2021) and the LGBTQ2SIA+ Student Success Plan . In addition, ODE participates in t he Equity in School Discipline Collaborative , which is a cross - state collaborative that brings together SEAs, educational and community -based organizations, and institutions o f higher education in Oregon and Washington to address the issue of equity in school climate and discipline. This group has recent publications that may further inform the ARP ESSER plan. The collaborative has also been involved in designing professional development tools to increase practitioners' knowledge in using data and evidence to improve 80 school discipline policies and practices. Data collections and Discipline : Discipline Incidents data collection is used to gather and identify student level discipline throughout the LEAs and their schools. The data is primarily used to satisfy federal reporting requirements under the ESSA, IDEA, and Gun Free Schools Act (GSFA), to calculate significant disproportionality, to respond to data requests from stakeholders, and to guide LEAs in their school improvement activities, including the Individual with Disabilities Education Act's SPP/APR Indicators B4a/B4b, B9/B10 and Significant Disproportionality, as required by OSEP. Data that is used statewide is linked below: Oregon Statewide Report Card Oregon IDEA Reports Discipline Media Files (2019 -20 coming soon) o 2018 -2019 Discipline Data Media o 2017 -2018 Discipline Data Media o 2016 -2017 Discipline Data Media o 2015 -2016 Discipline Data Media At-A-Glance Special Education Profiles ODE is also focused on several initiatives that are addressed throughout this overall plan that are supporting LEAs in creating a positive school climate with a focus on student belonging. F. Supporting the Educator Workforce The Department recognizes the toll that the COVID -19 pandemic has taken on the Nation's educators as well as students. In this section, SEAs will describe strategies for supporting and stabilizing the educator workforce and for making staffing decisions that will support students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs. 1. Supporting and Stabilizing the Educator Workforce: i. Describe the extent to which the State is facing shortages of educators, education administration personnel, and other school personnel involved in safely reopening schools, and the extent to which they vary by region/type of school district and/or groups of educators (e.g., special educators and related services personnel and paraprofessionals ; bilingual or English as a second language educators ; science, technology, engineering, and math ( \"STEM \") educators ; career and technical education (\"CTE\") educators; early childhood educators). Cite specific data on shortages and needs where available. Complete the table below , changing or adding additional rows as needed, or provide a narrative description. 81 Oregon currently lacks robust data to definitively understand shortages in educators, education administration personnel, and other school personnel involved in safely reopening schools. A review of teacher licensure data over the last three years shows a decline in emergency and provisional licenses issued by Oregon's licensing body - the Teacher Standards and Practices Commission. This decline was generally present across emergency and provisional l icense types, endorsement subject areas, and as a percentage of all teaching licenses issued. Emergency and provisional licenses are issued when teachers without a specific content -area endorsement, or a full Oregon teaching license, are hired by LEAs. LEA s apply for these types of licenses to fill needed positions on a short -term basis, and often right before the start of the school year. The declining three -year trend may be a result of a leveling off of increased emergency and provisional licenses reques ted by LEAs in response to the Every Student Succeeds Act requirement changes in the 2017 -18 school year. This, and potentially other confounding factors, contribute to the difficulty in relying on only the issuance of emergency and provisional licenses as a data point to measure teacher shortages. Staff at ODE reached out to partner organizations - specifically the Oregon School Personnel Association (OSPA) and Oregon Education Association (OEA) - to coordinate data and analysis. Both organizations lack t he data collection systems necessary to understand the current challenges, specifically in understanding regional and defined personnel shortages across the state. OSPA surveyed a random sample of districts, both rural and urban, regarding their needs relative to the educators listed in Table F1.LEAs surveyed rated their staffing needs using ratings of \"Extreme\", \"High\", \"Medium\" and \"Low.\" 80% or more of the districts surveyed identified special educators, bilingual educators and school psychologists as \"h igh\" or \"extreme\" needs. The need for nurses and counselors were identified as \"high\" or \"extreme\" by at least 60% of surveyed LEAs. We acknowledge that this data is limited in scope; however, it provides a baseline we can build on. One particular school personnel shortage is in the area of school nursing. As the impacts of the pandemic unfold, it is evident that it has negatively affected all students in deep and long - lasting ways \u2014 whether by illness, family unemployment, and/or stress, anxiety, and depre ssion. As experts in communicable disease prevention, population health, and school health, nurses play an essential role in planning for and curbing these effects on students and their families. The 2020 Nursing Services Report to the Oregon legislature describes a significant shortage of nursing services for all students in Oregon. Only seventy -three LE As (<37%) reported at least one full -time school nurse serving both students with and without health conditions. Although Oregon schools did report an increase of 15 FTE (5%) statewide, 61 LEAs (30%) still report no nurse access. Ad ditionally, even among t he LEAs who did report having a school nurse available, more than a quarter (30%, 43) of those have a nurse available less than half time. Despite 140 LEAs (71%) reporting enrolled students with health conditions, more than a dozen of those LEAs lack acces s to any nurses at all. Table F1. Area Data on Shortages/Needs Narrative Description 82 Special educators and related service personnel and paraprofessionals Minimal data available An audit of ODE Special Education Services conducted by the Oregon Secretary of State reported in June of 2020 that \"Rural districts compete with larger, urban school districts for special education teachers and educational aides. Rural districts also have limited access to specialists and more severe shortages of primary care and child care providers, who assist with the identification of children experiencing disabilities\" (pg 10) A Needs Assessment and Staff Shortage Survey was conducted in April 2021 with EI/ECSE and Regional Inclusive Service providers. EI/ECSE providers reported that Speech Language Pathologists, EI Specialists, and ECSE specialists were the most difficult positions to fill. Regional Inclusive Services reported difficulty filling positions for teachers of the visually impair ed, teachers of the deaf/hard of hearing, and occupational therapists. Additionally, Regional Inclusive Services reported challenges in hiring and retaining Autism Spectrum Disorder Specialists, Physical Therapists, and American Sign Language Interpreters. Among the three organizations that collect educator related data - the Higher Education Coordinating Commission, Teachers Standards and Practices Commission, and Oregon Department of Education - there is no current mechanism to collect LEA level staffing related to certain positions. Bilingual educators In the 2020 -21 school year 9.2% of Oregon teachers had a first language other than English. This does not include bilingual and 83 multilingual educators whose first language was English. English as a s econd language educators EL in -field and out -of-field teachers from Staff Assignment collection. Across the state in 2019 -20 a total of 841 EL teachers were reported, 743 were in -field (certified) and 98 were out -of-field (not certified). Counts of teachers reported as teaching the NCES/SCED course code 1008 - English as a Second Language and disaggregated by in/out of field (or not/certified) status are collected in the Staff Assignment data collection. These counts can be at the school level. STEM educators Not available Among the three organizations that collect educator related data - the Higher Education Coordinating Commission, Teachers Standards and Practices Commission, and Oregon Department of Education - there is no current mechanism to col lect LEA level staffing related to certain positions. CTE educators Not available Among the three organizations that collect educator related data - the Higher Education Coordinating Commission, Teachers Standards and Practices Commission, and Oregon Depa rtment of Education - there is no current mechanism to collect LEA level staffing related to certain positions. Early childhood educators There is limited data available for shortages but the following description relates to retention: Twenty -four percent of the 2018 workforce exited prior to 2019; that is they were not employed in a regulated facility in 2019 although 84 they had been reported as employed in 2018. Over time, 24% of the 2017 workforce, 23% of the 2016 workforce, 29% of the 2015 workforce, 16% percent of the 2014 workforce, 24% of the 2013 workforce, and 20% of the 2012 workforce left the workforce by the following year. School counselors Oregon currently has a statewide student -to-counselor ratio for all students of approximately 400 -to- 1. High schools have a ratio about 280-to-1. These ratios are down significantly from just a few years ago. The American School Counselor Association recommends a 250 - to-1 ratio of students to school counselors. They report that the national average for 2019 -20 was actually 424 -to-1 (though Oregon's calculation seems wrong on their site). The number of counselors employed by districts has been steadily increasing, from 1,237 in the 2016 -17 school year to 1,567 in the 2020 -21 school year. This represents a 27% increase, but we still remain well below the recommended ratio. Social workers National recommendation for SW to student ratio is 1:250. We have information on SpEd SW but don't have detailed data on other SW. The Social School Work Association of America recommends a general student to social worker ratio of 250 -to- 1, depending upon the characteristics and needs of the students. Nurses Oregon law (ORS 336.201) recommends the presence of a nurse in schools at a ratio of at least 1 Registered Nurse to every 750 students who do not require dedicated nurse staffing b y 2020. 85 19-20 analysis shows a ratio of 1:4,572 School psychologists Not available Among the three organizations that collect educator related data - the Higher Education Coordinating Commission, Teachers Standards and Practices Commission, and Oregon D epartment of Education - there is no current mechanism to collect district level staffing related to certain positions. Ethnically and Linguistically Diverse Educators All teachers employed (2019 -2020) 31,174 Ethnically diverse teachers employed (2019 -2020) 3,388 10.9% and linguistically diverse teachers employed (2019 -2020) 3,647 11.7% Ethnically diverse administrators employed (2019 -2020) 281 linguistically diverse administrators (2019 cally diverse guidance counselors (2019 Ethnically diverse educational assistants (2019 -2020) 3,149 20.3% There continues to be a widening gap between current ethnically diverse students in Oregon (38.5%) and educators (10.9%). Research ha s clearly indicated that a diverse educator workforce positively impacts student outcomes (Clotfelter, Ladd, & Vigdor, 2007; Gershenson, et al., 2017). The SEA feels strongly that diversifying the educator workforce is also a key component to the educator shortage discussion. Many current initiatives within the SEA are aimed at both supporting and diversifying the educator workforce. 86 Librarians In 1980 there were 547 students for every librarian and in 2017 that number was 3,652 students for every libraria n. This is equivalent to every school in Oregon having .64 FTE in 1980 to only .13 FTE in 2017. There has been a precipitous drop in the number of librarians throughout the state of Oregon, most notably in rural and economically disenfranchised areas. ii. Describe how the SEA will assist its LEAs in identifying the most urgent areas of shortages or potential shortages, with particular plans for individual LEAs facing the most significant needs (e.g., by avoiding layoffs, providing high -quality profession al learning opportunities , and addressing the impact of stress or trauma on educators) . Include a description of how other Federal COVID -19 funding (e.g., ESSER and GEER funds under the CARES Act and CRRSA Act) have already been used to avoid layoffs during the COVID -19 pandemic . The cornerstone of Oregon's Student Success Act (SSA) and a key requirement for accessing Student Investment Account (SIA) funds is for LEAs a nd independent charter schools to authentically engage communities in determining priorities for investment. This requirement will be a crucial mechanism in assisting LEAs in identifying the most urgent areas of shortage or potential shortage. A scan of budgets for SIA funds shows 82% of proposed expenditures that would increase staffin g of both licensed and classified personnel. The SIA funds must be invested in specific allowable use categories that help focus areas of need. Those areas and the percentages of overall investment across the state are as follows: Improving student health and safety - 45% Increased instructional time - 4% Improved access to well -rounded education opportunities - 22% Reducing class sizes - 22% The categories and percentage of budgeted activities suggest LEAs, through their community engagement and prioritiza tion process, saw a significant need to invest in additional staff. This same scan showed that before COVID and subsequent reductions in SIA funds, LEAs proposed to add 2746 FTE. Revised plans after reductions to SIA funds showed 738 FTE removed from plann ed budget and activities. It remains unclear if the reduction in proposed FTE were related to shortages or reduced funding, but speaks to a level of need as a result of engagement processes. A review of ESSR I investments by LEAs indicates that 46% of all funds were spent on personnel and benefits. Retention or addition of teaching staff to ensure meeting safety protocols for in -87 person instruction was the most common use of funds, followed closely by investments in counselors and mental health providers an d increased janitorial staff. Currently, ODE does not have disaggregated data to better understand the specific staffing areas for these investments. Understanding the Problem: ODE will work with partner agencies, education service districts, LEAs, and other educational entities to better understand educator shortages and address potential gaps. As mentioned, current data is limited to current educator licensure status (emergency, provisional, conditional, etc.) and in order to address the problem we nee d to first understand the problem. In an effort to address this gap in understanding, ODE will consider the following actions: 1. Explore and design how to expand or focus current initiatives that are already creating a through line for data collections alongside LEAs. The main lever for this data collection is the Student Success Act which is supporting LEAs as they operationalize ongoing and meaningful community engagement to inform their spending. We can leverage this existing conduit to identify educa tor shortages. We can also lean into the Educator Advancement Council (EAC) as an intermediary to support the organization, analysis, and dissemination of educator workforce data. 2. Collaborate with the EAC, Oregon's educator licensing agency the Teachers S tandards and Practices Commission (TSPC), and the Higher Education Coordinating Commission (HECC) to identify what data should be collected and how it might be used. 3. Coordinate with the EAC to expand its capacity and current sightline. The Educator Equity Report is an unfunded mandate within Oregon's Educator Equity Act, which tracks Oregon's progress in increasing the number of teacher candidates prepared to teach and ready for hire as well as the number of culturally and racially diverse teachers and adm inistrators hired in Oregon's public schools. It is a powerful publication that could be expanded to consider broader gaps in the educator workforce. The EAC is currently working with the Oregon legislature to create a more meaningful and impactful mandate , including policy recommendations. The infrastructure and focus of this current initiative could be broadened to incorporate a deeper understanding of all facets of the educator workforce. Mental Health Supports The Oregon Department of Education (ODE) a nd the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) hold joint responsibility for promoting and serving the mental health and well -being of school communities. In 2020 ODE was selected as one of nine states to participate in a CASEL/CCSSO SEL-MTSS project, which served a s the catalyst for the ODE/OHA Strengthening Mental Health in Education Initiative (SMHiE). A major focus of this work was to assess the strengths, gaps and opportunities of the Oregon's school -based mental health systems, and begin to disseminate ODE's In tegrated Model of Mental Health and Mental Health Toolkit to support LEAs in their delivery of multi -tiered mental health prevention and intervention services and supports. 88 The SMHiE reinforced the need for a robust, culturally responsive mental health in frastructure and workforce to equitably meet the mental health needs of Oregon school communities. Oregon was recently selected as one of six states to participate in the National Governors Association (NGA) Supporting Whole Child Initiatives project. This will allow ODE to build on the work of the SMHiE, and identify the legislative and procedural steps necessary to build an infrastructure and workforce to meet the mental health needs of Oregon school communities. Many of the workforce needs identified in the SMHiE may be addressed by the implementation of the Student Success Act. Passed during the 2019 legislative session, the Student Success Act is expected to infuse approximately $1 billion in early learning and K -12 education each year. Of those funds, roughly $500 million will be devoted to the Student Investment Account (SIA). One of the two primary aims of the Student Investment Account (SIA) is to meet students' mental health needs. In January 2020, ODE and OHA released the Centering Mental and Behavioral Health resource to support districts and eligible charter schools in developing their SIA plans. ODE will also be providing technical assistance and coaching programs to support SIA grantees, which will include guidance regarding the implementation of the ODE Integrated Model of Mental Health. Working in tandem, the SMHiE and NGA projects and the investments from the SIA will increase student access to mental health prevention, intervention and crisis services and supports, and result in the develo pment of a continuum of care that provides for the mental health needs of school communities. Significantly more resources will be needed to create the scaffolding to ensure that these systems provide equitable access to culturally responsive, sustainable services for all students. iii. Describe the actions the SEA will take to fill anticipated gaps in certified teachers for the start of the 2021 -2022 school year and to what extent the SEA will further support its LEAs in expanding the educator pipeline and educator diversity while addressing the immediate needs of students disproportionately impacted by the pandemic (e.g., recruiting teaching candidates to provide high - dosage tutoring or implementing residencies for teacher candidat es). ODE has several current initiatives that will support LEAs during the 2021 -2022 school year as well as develop robust, sustainable systems to support and diversify the educator workforce well beyond the coming year. Snapshot: Current Initiatives to Recruit, Retain, and Support Educators ODE is targeting state resources to respond to immediate educator shortages as well as implement a long -term strategy towards supporting and diversifying the educator workforce. ODE also has areas of growth related to better understanding educator workforce shortages 89 and providing student access to key support staff. What follows is a snapshot of current initiatives broadly impacting the educator workforce as well as areas ODE could explore building out over the com ing year to address educator shortages, disparities in teacher diversity, preparing future educators, and supporting current educators. ODE needs to continue to lean into these existing programs, especially those that center community voice, work to crea te racially affirming school systems, and work from a continuous improvement framework. Later in this document there will be a longer narrative related to current initiatives, but this table will provide a quick glance of current ODE work: Current Initiat ive Educator Career Continuum Focus Funding Mechanism Potential Growth Regional Educator Networks Recruitment, retention, professional learning, leadership development Educator Advancement Fund Regional Educator Networks could expand capacity and provide more regionally specific supports to educators throughout Oregon. Grow Your Own Initiatives Pathways to education, recruitment, partnerships SIA Funding 27 Grow Your Own Programs were funded this year and there is potential to provide additional resources to deepen current programs and fund new programs. American Indian/Alaska Native Educator Success Support for increasing AI/AN educators SSA funding 9 grants were funded to LEAs and other education partners. Racial Justice Institute Connect and support current educators of color (retention) SIA Funding The Racial Justice Institute is beginning to take shape and could grow beyond its current support of educators of color. This might include anti -racist communities of practice for educational leaders. Alternative Pathways Pathways to education and recruitment TBD: Legislation in process This is an exciting development in Oregon that could lead to apprenticeship programs and other forms of alternative pathways into education. 90 Oregon Teacher Scholarships Program and Oregon Administrative Scholarships Program Pathways, mitigate barriers Educator Advancement Fund and SIA Currently over 150 future educators of color and over 100 future administrators of color are being funded through this program. There is po tential to expand the number and amount of scholarships. Educator Advancement Council Through the work of the Educator Advancement Council (EAC), which envisions a culturally - sustained and revitalized workforce that mirrors the demographics of Oregon's s tudents, Oregon is well positioned to support LEAs in expanding the educator pipeline and increasing educator diversity. The following is a list of existing state programs, partnerships, and networks coordinated and funded through the EAC. Recruitment, Re tention, and Professional Learning: Regional Educator Networks Supporting Current Educators of Color: Racial Justice Institute, Phase 1: o Create and Run a Black, Indigenous, Tribal, Latinx, Asian, Pacific Islander, and educators of color Network for Oregon Educators: o Create and Run a Racial Justice Fellowship: Pathways in Education: Grow Your Own (GYO) Statewide Initiative Alternative Pathways: Creating More Pathways Mitigating Barriers: Working in Partnership with Teachers Standards and Practices Commissi on (TSPC) and the Higher Education Coordinating Commission (HECC) to Diversify the Educator Workforce Educator Preparation: Collaborating with Universities to Better Support Future Educators of Color 2. Staffing to Support Student Needs: Describe the extent to which the SEA has developed or will develop strategies and will support its LEAs in increasing student access to key support staff within school buildings , including school counselors, special education personnel, nurses, social work ers, and psychologists (e.g. hiring additional personnel or freeing up these staff to focus on providing services to students) . Expanding Flexibility of LEA Staffing Through the passage of HB 2876, LEAs have been afforded more flexibility in hiring key s upport staff. Prior to the passage of HB2876, only a licensed school counselor could design and implement the required Comprehensive School Counseling Plan (CSCP), but with the passage of HB2876, schools can utilize a school social worker or a team appro ach to support the design and implementation of the CSCP. In fall 2020, ODE wrote guidance for school districts , so that they can broaden their hiring practices to meet the strengths and needs of their school 91 community. Another initiative is the Student Success Act (SSA), which has impacted hiring key support staff and providing expanded mental health supports for students and educators. Impact of SSA Funding on Key Support Staff As mentioned above, the Student Investment Account (SIA) has had a significant impact on education in Oregon. One of the key components of the SIA funding is increasing LEAs capacity both to reduce class size but a lso to provide more robust wraparound support for students. In fact, almost 80% of SIA funding was directed towards increasing staffing. As mentioned, this might also complicate Oregon's understanding of educator shortage because any shortages pre-pandemic and post -pandemic might be offset by this infusion of resources to districts from SIA. That being said, there are a few metrics ODE can name that might connect with students' access to key support staff. A funding reduction due to the pandemic reduced t he impact SIA had on LEAs hiring key support staff, but considering that the SIA was a novel injection of resources, even the reduction was a net increase in the current numbers. The following table outlines LEAs planned usage for SIA funding to increase s pecifically counselors, nurses, and social workers: Key Support Staff Original Budget FTEs Updated Budget FTEs Counselors or Behavior Specialists 548 289 Nurses or Health Professionals 43 38 Social Workers 94 75 Total (INCLUDES estimated FTEs for contracted services) 685 403 Even with the reduction in funding, LEAs are estimating they will still add an additional 403 key support staff. These numbers are not exact and ODE will have more accurate accounting at the end of June, but it is likely that the net number of key support staff increased as a result of SIA funding. Additionally, 9 -10% of SIA funding was directed towards classified staff salaries, which could correlate to \"freeing up these staff to focus on providing services to students.\" Wha t is missing is a granular view of how these funds have been spent and how this compares with potential shortages based on recommended ratios. What also should be considered is how ODE coaches or supports LEAs to identify the needs of the community, famili es, and students connected to key support staff. For example, one LEA has leveraged SIA funding to hire Bilingual 92 Educators and Counselors specifically in schools that serve historically and currently marginalized students. G. Monitoring and Measuring Progress The Department recognizes that transparency on how ARP ESSER funds are used and their impact on the Nation's education system is a fundamental responsibility of Federal, State, and local government . In this section, SEAs will describe how they are building capacity at the SEA and LEA levels to ensure high-quality data collection and reporting and to safeguard funds for their intended purposes. 1. Capacity for Data Collection and Reporting: It is im portant for an SEA to continuously monitor progress and make adjustments to its strategies , as well as to support its LEAs in making adjustments to LEA strategies, based on impact . Describe how the SEA will ensure its capacity and the capacity of its LEAs to collect data on reporting requirements, including but not limited to the examples of reporting requirements described in the SEA's Grant Award Notification (listed in Appendix B). Describe the SEA's capacity and strategy to collect data from its LEAs (disaggregated by student group , where applicable) , to the greatest extent practicable , including any steps the SEA will take to build its capacity in the future (which may include the use o f ARP ESSER and other Federal COVID -19 pandemic funds at the SEA and LEA levels) , on issues that may include the following: i. Student learning , including the academic impact of lost instructional time during the COVID -19 pandemic ; ii. Opportunity to learn measures (e.g., chronic absenteeism ; student engagement ; use of exclusionary discipline; access to and participation in advanced coursework ; access to technology , including educator access to professional development on the effective use of technology ; access to high -quality educators ; access to school counselors, social workers, nurses, and school psychologists; and results from student, parent, and/or educator surveys ); iii. Fiscal data that is comparable across the State (e.g., per-pupil expenditures at the LEA and school levels) ; iv. Jobs created and retained (by position type); v. Participation in programs funded by ARP ESSER resources (e.g., summer and afterschool programs ); and vi. Other reporting requirements reasonably required by the Secretary (please refer to Appendix B of this templa te; final requirements will be issued separately ). Capacity in Meeting Federal Reporting Requirements (Appendix B) ODE has a robust method for collecting data and reporting from LEAs and currently collects data using 89 unique data collections; see Appendix I. Each fall ODE data owners and data stewards review changes to state and federal law and regulations, as well a s new state and 93 federal initiatives, and use this information to propose adjustments to their collections to meet those changing needs. ODE provides training, resources, and processes to help ensure that data submitted to ODE by LEAs is of the highest qu ality possible. Training is provided yearly on individual student -level, staff -level, and institution -level collections. These trainings discuss collection business rules and highlight any changes made, which are also documented in collection manuals. ODE' s consolidated collection system also incorporates processes to help ensure accuracy and consistency of submitted data. This includes validations and logic checks for data compliance with business rules and audits performed by data stewards. ODE also prov ides student -level and aggregate data back to LEAs through our secure district website. Data available here includes a significant amount of data on student outcomes, including graduation, attendance, statewide summative assessments, 9th grade on track, discipline, Career and Technical Education, and staffing counts and qualifications. While these data are also reported publicly, this system allows LEAs to access the unsuppressed and student - or staff -level data that they will need and can use locally to s upport students. These data are also used by ODE program staff to support LEAs. In terms of meeting the data reporting requirements outlined in the Grant Award Notification outlined in Appendix B, ODE currently has the capacity to fully or partially addr ess these requirements. ODE also recognizes there are limitations to our current data collections that will require additional capacity. Using Federal ESSER resources, ODE has developed an initial staffing plan to meet ongoing requirements, to the extent p ossible. Currently, the Department is able to fully meet the following Appendix B requirements: For developing strategies and implementing public health protocols and creating overall plans and policies to support in -person instruction and maximizing in-person instruction time , ODE publicly reported its 2020 -21 implementation guidance on the Ready Schools, Safe Learners (RSSL) web page. In addition, LEAs were required to create operational blueprints for the 2020 -21 school year and post these on their websites. As the state transitions into the 2021 -22 school year, it will continue to update guidance to ensure schools are implement ing protocols in accordance with guidance and established federal and state plans and policies. Section B.1provides more specifi c detail on current and future RSSL guidance. The Department has a process in place to track data on each school's mode of instruction (fully in -person, hybrid, and fully remote). As described in Section A.5, ODE collects weekly information on each school's mode of instruction. The department will continue to collect information on the instructional modes in which schools are oper ating under. In addition, ODE collects enrollment data for school funding and other purposes four times a year. This data will be overlaid with mode of instruction to meet 94 the reporting requirement outlined in Appendix B and as prescribed in Appendix A. While enrollment information may be used for the requirement, ODE does not currently collect disaggregated attendance of the student population by instruction mode. In terms of Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency (FFATA) reporting requirements, ODE uses an internal application to award and reimburse subgrants; this system is called the Electronic Grant Management System (EGMS). EGMS processes subgrant awards, electronic reimbursements, and interfaces with Oregon's State Financial Management Syst em (SFMS), the state's financial system of record. A query is pulled on a monthly basis from SFMS for specified subgrant information for FFATA, which is then batched and submitted to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) every month. As mentioned, there are several requirements in which ODE collects parts of the information and will increase capacity to help establish the necessary structures, processes, and/or data collections to meet them. This includes data and/or information specific to the fol lowing Appendix B requirements: SEA and LEA use of funds to meet students' social, emotional, and academic needs, including summer enrichment programming and other evidence -based interventions, and how they advance equity for underserved students. SEA and LEA uses of funds to sustain and support access to early childhood education programs. Impacts and outcomes (disaggregated by student subgroup) through use of ARP ESSER funding (e.g., quantitative and qualitative results of ARP ESSER funding, including on personnel, student learning, and budgeting at the school and district level). Student data (disaggregated by student subgroup) related to how the COVID -19 pandemic has affected instruction and learning. To meet these requirements, ODE will review its curr ent portfolio of data collections and work to establish the appropriate processes necessary for complying and/or collecting the needed information. In addition, ODE will be using ESSER funding to establish additional research and data collection capacity needed for meeting the federal requirements, as well as building sustainable future capacity in providing both data and information needed to help LEAs in addressing student needs beyond the pandemic. In order to accomplish this, ODE will rely on data and information collected from current initiatives and programs of which many were outlined in both Section E and Section F. This data and information is already available and helps support LEAs better utilize the data and information they collect locally . Better use and analysis of this data will enable LEAs to more effectively respond to student needs. Some of this data and information includes: Career and Technical Education (CTE) : Oregon has special data collections and reports at both secondary and postsecondary institutions on CTE programs. These data include participation, concentration, completion, and other performance targets required for Perkins V. These data are used not o nly for accountability, but are a central component 95 of CTE program continuous improvement. As part of Oregon's CTE State Plan, ODE will be providing LEAs and regions with a CTE data dashboard that will make it easier to disaggregate data by gender, race/et hnicity, Perkins V special populations, and CTE program type. ODE, in partnership with the Northwest Regional Education Laboratory, has started to provide training to regional and local CTE leaders on use of the dashboard to identify inequities in CTE prog rams, conduct a root cause analysis, and create plans to remove barriers to equitable participation and outcomes in CTE. High School Success : Recipients eligible for High School Success funds are provided annual data sheets including ninth grade on -track, graduation, dropout, absenteeism, and advanced course participation rates disaggregated by focal student populations. Recipients are additionally encouraged to review local quantitative data, such as tenth grade on -track rates, benchmark assessment result s, and qualitative data gathered through the use of surveys or empathy interviews. It is expected these data points will inform the creation of High School Success goals and activities designed to aid recipients in meeting their goals. Recipients include L EAs. Beginning in the 2021 -23 biennium, grant recipients are required to have specific systems of support for students in place, including sufficient time for teacher and staff collaboration to review data on student's grades, absences, and discipline by student and by course, and to develop strategies to ensure at -risk students stay on track to graduate. To support this, recipients who did not already have a collaboration system in place were encouraged to spend funds on data dashboards and/or professiona l development for staff in data analysis. During the most recent biennium, 60% of recipients (134) began work on establishing teacher teams and over 25% (62) spent funds on data dashboards and related training. The Center for High School Success , established in 2017 by STAND for Children, has developed networks throughout Oregon to assist high schools in building capacity for highly effective teacher teams through training in data analysis and providing peer learning opportunities. Participation in the Center for High School Success network has been supported through the use of High School Success funds. Student Investment Account : Recipients eligible for Student Investment Account funds were provided data sh eets containing five years of attendance, ninth grade on -track, four -year graduation, five -year completers, and third grade reading proficiency rates disaggregated by focal student populations. These data points were expected to be utilized by LEA and scho ol administration, with school and community input, to develop goals and strategies for meeting those goals. ODE has provided support for SIA grant recipients to develop longitudinal performance growth targets for each of the five data points. These targe ts, reviewed annually, are designed to focus on closing gaps for historically underserved or marginalized student populations. Applicants are encouraged to set growth targets for local metrics, such as 96 student survey results or benchmark assessment results , which may more accurately align to specific activities contained in their Student Investment Account plans. Oregon Statewide Assessment System: Summative assessment data are available from spring 2021 administrations in language arts, mathematics, and s cience from ODE's general and alternate assessments. Those data are not likely to yield actionable information at the systems level due to historically low participation rates. However, ODE invested in supporting classroom assessment practices, assessments for learning, through investments in resources and training for implementation of a statewide English language arts and mathematics interim assessment system , including formative instructions resources called Tools for Teachers that can supplement and guide instructional practices. A science interim assessment was available for LEA purchase and ODE hopes to make it available statewide starting in the 202 1-22 school year. These resources found on the webpage linked above, are supported by a six -module training series called the \"Balanced Assessment Series\". This series helps ODE advance our goal of supporting LEA assessment practices designed to provide co herent, continuous, and comprehensive information for our education systems across the spectrum of important assessment practices, from formative, to interim, and summative. Finally, we developed a student survey to incorporate student voice as a valuable source of information through the Student Educational Equity Development Survey Pilot, described below. Student Educational Equity Development (SEED) Survey : As described in Section A4, in 2020 -21 ODE is piloting a survey about the educational experiences of Oregon students, with an operational survey starting in 2021 -22. This survey will help ODE and LEAs better interpret information we are already gathering through statewide testing. SEED Survey information may also help LEAs develop a fuller picture of their local contexts and make strategic modifications to curriculum, instruction, and related supports that they offer students. ODE posted a communication toolkit for the survey pilot, which includes development, design, training, and communication templates, in addition to the publicly -available survey items themselves (English and Spanish). ODE is in the process of designing t he reporting of this data to LEAs when the survey is expected to become operational, pending Oregon State Board of Education review and approval, in the spring of 2022. Participation in this year's pilot administration may not be sufficient to yield genera lizable results, however, this could result in an additional, optional, pilot administration in spring 2022. Community and Partner Engagement : A key source of data for LEAs will be their families, communities, and education partners. ODE has developed an Engagement Toolkit that provides extensive resources for LEAs that they can use as they part ner with their communities and gather input on how best to address the impacts of the pandemic and address unfinished learning. Early Indicator and Intervention Systems : ODE also provides guidance and technical support for LEAs and ESDs as they develop and implement systems to support students 97 to get, and stay on track, to graduate from high school. Several ESDs and LEA s have already implemented these systems which provide real -time data to support students. A core component of the EIIS is reliable, easily accessible data that identifies student progress toward graduation in multiple dimensions. Student attendance, eng agement in learning, and learning outcomes (grades, standardized test scores) are common indicators of progress towards graduation. Most electronic student information systems offer standard and customizable reports on these data points. Schools and LEAs s hould reflect on additional indicators and influencers of student success, including student empathy interviews, social -emotional well -being surveys, health and mental health supports, and opportunity for enrichment activities as additional sources of data for the EIIS. Some LEAs may opt for a locally -produced data system rather than a commercially available product, depending on district size and local factors. Capacity in Meeting Other Reporting Needs In addition to meeting federal requirements, there ma y also be data and information needed by ODE or LEAs to help support or address various student and school issues an d challenges caused by COVID -19. While ODE and LEAs already collect, analyze, and report a large amount of data that can be used to support students and families, more can be done. Here are some strategies that ODE is exploring or working to implement to help the capacity for data use and analysis in the future: Expand the creation and use of data dashboards, both internally for ODE staff, and externally for LEAs and the public. Increase internal staffing and ODE capacity to analyze data and support data interpretation by LEAs. Increase the information that ODE collects on expanded learning time or programs designed to keep students engaged and on track to graduate. This would include before - school, after -school and summer learning programs. Increase the collection and reporting of data on student credit attainment and access to advanced coursework, including Advanced Placement, International Ba ccalaureate, and dual credit. Provide more professional development to ODE staff so that they can in turn promote better data utilization in school and LEA decision making. Partner with the State Longitudinal Data System to work toward providing LEAs information on post -graduation success metrics such as employment and college enrollment, persistence, and completion. Work with LEAs to improve the granularity of their reporting so that we can increase the accuracy of the school -level per -pupil funding repor ted. Determine how current collection on staff employed by each LEA may be expanded to include information on new jobs created and/or retained. Analyze methods for collecting disaggregated data on before and after school programs. While ODE is currently planning on collecting aggregate data on summer learning opportunities, it will take more research on how to effectively build into periodic grant 98 reports. Overall, while ODE has capacity to meet the federal reporting requirements, it will take additional work to identify methods to compile and possibly collect more information related to specific student impacts and outcomes. With these additional ESSER resources, funding will be committed to help address these needs and provide LEAs with valuable information in responding to student needs. 2. Monitoring and Internal Controls: Describe how the SEA will implement appropriate fiscal monitoring of and internal controls for the ARP ESSER funds (e.g., by updating the SEA's plan for monitoring funds and internal controls under the CARES and CRRSA Acts ; addressing potential sources of waste, fraud, and abuse; conducting random audits ; or other tools ). In this response, please describe the SEA's current capacity to monitor ARP ESSER ; steps , if needed, to increase capacity ; and any foreseeable gaps in capacity , including how the SEA will provide its LEAs with technical assistance in the anticipated areas of greatest need . ODE currently has a process in place to review annual LEA audits and provide follow up on areas identified as concerns, as well as perform additional monitoring and follow up. In addition, Under SSA, ODE is currently developing a system of deeper analysis on return on academic investment. Oregon has also implemented several fiscal monitoring protocols and internal controls for the ARP ESSER funds, which include: All LEAs and sub recipients are subject to an annual municipal audit b y either an independent third -party auditor or the Secretary of State Audits Division. All accounting of ESSER funds are in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Where applicable, application and grant agreements were created with legal sufficiency from Oregon's Attorney General's Office. These agreements were reviewed and approved by ODE staff after they were submitted by LEAs or other eligible funding recipients prior to the allocations and disbursement of funding. Applications and gra nt agreements have (or will have updated) assurances and certifications in place for LEAs or other eligible funding recipients to attest compliance with all ARP ESSER grant program requirements. Grant funds are distributed on a reimbursement basis, so LEAs must incur a General Fund expense prior to submitting claims for payment. Payments are administered by ODE using its centralized Electronic Grant Management System, which provides tracking and monitoring of grant funds and payment claims. A reimbursement template was developed that uses a state chart of accounts for K -12 education, whereby there is a standardized level of reporting, comparison, and review. 99 All reimbursement claims are reviewed by ODE staff for reasonableness prior to release of payment. Mu ltiple staff are involved with the review and eventual release of funding. All LEAs and other eligible funding recipients were instructed to maintain and track revenues, expenses, and receipts in a special fund for each federal program and unique CFDA. All LEAs and other eligible funding recipients are aware they are subject to either a desk - audit, or an in -the-field audit at any time. Monitoring, best -practices, guidance, technical support, and review are ongoing with regular communications, websites, and webinars. To date, ODE has primarily managed these responsibilities within existing processes and staff. However, in order to meet some of the new and additional reporting requirements, particularly around specific fiscal and outcome reporting, ODE will us e a combination of ESSER administrative funds to increase staffing within its Office of Finance and Information Technology (OFIT). OFIT currently oversees and monitors the 90% of the ESSER funding required to go to LEAs. While ODE has the appropriate syste ms and internal controls to effectively manage these funds, the volume of funding, technical assistance, and monitoring will require additional staffing. With ESSER administrative funds, ODE will be able to continue its effective oversight of the 90% fund ing, as well as provide support in standing up any additional internal controls or oversight in other areas of ODE that will manage the set -aside resources. 100 Appendix A: School Operating Status and Instructional Mode Data Template Indicate the date or time period represented by the following data. These data reflect school operating status for the week of May 22 to May 29. The student enrollment counts come from data collected on May 3rd, but ODE used the May 22 to May 29 operating status to report stu dents in remote, hybrid, or in -person categories. Table 1 In the most recent time period available, how many schools in your State offer ed each mode of instruction or learning model described below ? Each row should account for all schools in your State, so that, for each row, the sum of the numbers in the \"offered to all students,\" \"offered to some students,\" and \"not offered\" columns is equal to the number in the \"all schools\" column.

Oregon res ponded to this appendix in section G. 104 Appendix C: Assurances By sign ing this document , the SEA assures all of the following: The SEA will conduct all its operations so that no person shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under the ARP ESSER program or activity based on race, color, national origin, which includes a person's limited English proficiency or English learner status and a person's actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics; sex; age; or disability. These non - discrimination obligations arise under Federal civil rights laws, including but no t limited to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. In addition, the SEA must comply with all regulations, guideline s, and standards issued by the Department under any of these statutes ; The SEA will comply with all ARP Act and other ARP ESSER requirements and all requirements of its Grant Award Notification, including but not limited to: o Complying with the maintenance of effort provision in section 2004(a)(1) of the ARP Act, absent a waiver by the Secretary pursuant to section 2004( a)(2) of the ARP Act ; and o Complying with the maintenance of equity provisions in section 2004(b) of the ARP Act, and ensurin g its LEAs comply with the maintenance of equity provision in section 2004(c) of the ARP Act (please note that the Department will provide additional guidance on maintenance of equity shortly) ; The SEA will allocate ARP ESSER funds to LEAs in an expedited and timely manner and, to the extent practicable, not later than 60 days after the SEA receives ARP ESSER funds (i.e., 60 days from the date the SEA receives each portion of its ARP ESSER funds). An SEA that is not able to allocate such funds within 60 day s because it is not practicable (e.g., because of pre -existing State board approval requirements) will provide an explanation to the Department within 30 days of receiving each portion of its ARP ESSER funds (submitted via email to your Program Officer at [State].OESE@ed.gov (e.g., Alabama.OESE@ed.gov)) , including a description of specific actions the SEA is taking to provide ARP ESSER funds to LEAs in an expedited and timely manner and the SEA's expected timeline for doing so ; The SEA will implement eviden ce-based interventions as required under section 2001(f) of the ARP Act and ensure its LEAs implement evidence -based interventions , as required by section 2001(e)(1) of the ARP Act; The SEA will address the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on underserved students (i.e., students from low -income families, students from racial or ethnic groups (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by race or ethnicity) , gender (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by gender ), English learners, children with disabilities, students experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, and migratory students) , as required under section 2 001(f) of the ARP Act, and ensure its LEAs address the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on underserved students (i.e., students from low -income families, students from racial or ethnic groups, gender, English learners, children with disabil ities, students experiencing homelessness, children and 105 youth in foster care, and migratory students) , as required by section 2001(e)(1) of the ARP Act; and The SEA will provide to the Department : (1) the URL(s) where the public can readily find data on school operating status and (2) the URL(s) for the SEA and/or LEA websites where the public can find the LEA plans for a) the safe return to in-person instruction and continuity of services required under section 2001(i) of the ARP Act , and b) use of ARP ESSER funds . SEAs should consider ensuring a standardized URL format in all cases (e.g., xxx.gov/COVID plan). 106 Appendix D OMB Control No. 1894 -0005 (Exp. 0 6/30/2023) NOTICE TO ALL APPLICANTS The purpose of this enclosure is to inform you about a new provision in the Department of Educations General Education Provisions Act ( \"GEPA \") that applies to applicants for new grant awards under Department programs. This provision is Section 427 of GEP A, enacted as part of the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (Public Law (P.L.) 103 -382). To Whom Does This Provision Apply? Section 427 of GEPA affects applicants for new grant awards under this program. ALL APPLICANTS FOR NEW AWARDS MUST INCLUDE INFORMATION IN THEIR APPLICATIONS TO ADDRESS THIS NEW PROVISION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE FUNDING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. (If this program is a State -formula grant program, a State needs to provide this description only for projects or activities that it carries out with funds reserved for State - level uses. In addition, local school districts or other eligible applicants that apply to the State for funding need to provide this description in their applications to the State for funding. The State would be responsibl e for ensuring that the school district or other local entity has submitted a sufficient section 427 statement as described below.) What Does This Provision Require? Section 427 requires each applicant for funds (other than an individual person) to include in its application a description of the steps the applicant proposes to take to ensure equitable access to, and participation in, its Federally - assisted program for students, teachers, and other program beneficiaries with special needs. This provision al lows applicants discretion in developing the required description. The statute highlights six types of barriers that can impede equitable access or participation: gender, race, national origin, color, disability, or age. Based on local circumstances, you should determine whether these or other barriers may prevent your students, teachers, etc. from such access to, or participation in, the Federally -funded project or activity. The description in your application of steps to be taken to overcome these barr iers need not be lengthy; you may provide a clear and succinct description of how you plan to address those barriers that are applicable to your circumstances. In addition, the information may be provided in a single narrative, or, if appropriate, may be discussed in connection with related topics in the application. Section 427 is not intended to duplicate the requirements of civil rights statutes, but rather to ensure that, in designing their projects, applicants for Federal funds address equity concerns that may affect the ability of certain potential beneficiaries to fully participate in the project and to achieve high standards.

Appendix E : Ready Schools, Safe Learners Guidance Please see attachment titled \"Appendix E: Ready Schools, Safe Learners. \" Appendix F: Table B.1. Mitigation strategy SEA response to each mitigation strategy - within the current RSSL Guidance Universal and correct wearing of masks As of May 31, 2021 - Face coverings are required for all students in grades kindergarten and up, along with all staff. Student or family refusal to wear appropriate face covering for a values -based reason then dictates that educational needs be met through Comprehensive Distance Learning. Staff refusal to wear appropriate face coverings should be addressed according to established school or district processes. Physical distancing among students and when students are present in the building (e.g. , including use of cohorts/podding) As of May 31, 2021 -Elementary Level: Support physical distancing in all daily activities and instruction, maintaining at least 3 feet between students to the maximum extent possible. Middle and High School Level: when at a county case rate of <200: Support physical distancing in all daily activities and instruction, maintaining at least 3 feet between students to the maximum extent possible. when at a county case rate of 200 : Support physical distancing in all daily activities and 109 instruction, maintaining at least 6 feet between students to the maximum extent possible. All Levels/Staff: Support physical distancing in all daily activities and instruction, maintaining 6 feet between staff at all times and 6 feet between staff and students to the maximum extent possible. Handwashing and respiratory etiquette As of May 31, 2021 All people on campus shall be advised and encouraged to frequently wash their hands or use hand sanitizer. Cleaning and maintaining healthy faci lities, including improving ventilation As of May 31, 2021 Facilities must be cleaned and disinfected at least daily to prevent transmission of the virus from surfaces (see CDC's guidance on disinfecting public spaces). Clean, sanitize, and disinfect f requently touched surfaces (e.g. door handles, sink handles, drinking fountains, transport vehicles) and shared objects (e.g., toys, games, art supplies) between uses multiple times per day. Maintain clean and disinfected (CDC guidance) environments, inclu ding classrooms, cafeteria settings and restrooms. Provide time and supplies for the cleaning and disinfecting of high -touch surfaces between multiple student uses, even in the same cohort. Outdoor learning spaces must have at least 50% of the square foo tage of its sides open for airflow such that open sides are not adjacent to each other. Outdoor playground structures require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection. Shared equipment should be cleaned and disinfected at least daily in acc ordance with CDC guidance. Apply disinfectants safely and correctly following labeling directions as specified by the manufacturer. Keep these products away from students. To reduce the risk of asthma, choose disinfectant products on the EPA List N with asthma -safer ingredients. Schools with HVAC systems must evaluate the system to minimize indoor air recirculation (thus maximizing fresh outdoor air) to the extent possible. Schools that do not have mechanical ventilation systems shall, to the extent possible, increase natural vent ilation by opening windows and interior doors before students arrive and after 110 students leave, and while students are present. Do not prop open doors that can pose a safety or security risk to students and staff (e.g., exterior doors and fire doors that must remain closed.) Schools with HVAC systems should ensure all filters are maintained and replaced as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the system. All intake ports that provide outside air to the HVAC system should be cleaned, maintained, and cleared of any debris that may affect the function and performance of the ventilation system. Consider running ventilation systems continuously and changing the filters more frequently. Do not use fans if they pose a safety or health risk, such as increasing exposure to pollen/allergies or exacerbating asthma symptoms. Consider using window fans or box fans positioned in open windows to blow fresh outdoor air into the classroom via one window, and indoor air out of the classroom via another window. Fans must not be used in rooms with closed windows and doors, as this does not allow for fresh air to circulate. Consider the need for increased ventilation in areas where students with special health care needs receive medication or treatments. Contac t tracing in combination with isolation and quarantine, in collaboration with the State, local, territorial, or Tribal health departments As of May 31, 2021 Create a system for maintaining daily logs for each student/cohort for the purposes of contact tra cing. This system needs to be made in consultation with a school/district nurse or an LPHA official. Sample logs are available as a part of the Oregon School Nurses Association COVID -19 Toolkit. Protocol to record/keep daily logs to be used for contact tracing for a minimum of four weeks to assist the LPHA as needed. State, local, and Tribal health departments collaborated to develop the contract tracing system. Diagnostic and screening testing As of May 31, 2021 If the public or private school is ope rating an On -Site or Hybrid Instructional Model, but is located in a county that 111 does not meet the advisory metrics; the school must offer access to on -site testing for symptomatic students and staff identified on campus as well as those with known exposur es to individuals with COVID. This resource is available to all schools in Oregon. See guidance from the Oregon Health Authority . In April 2021, the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) launched a free COVID -19 testing program for K -12 teachers and staff in order to help reduce the spread of COVID -19 in schools. This program offers free weekly screening testing by mail to any unvaccinated public or private K -12 teacher or staff member, including volunteers. Testing is not recommended for vaccinated K -12 teachers and staff because the risk of COVID -19 in vaccinated individuals is very low. Participation is voluntary, and participants can opt -out at any time. If you register for this program, a COVID -19 test kit will be mailed directly to your home each week. The at - home COVID -19 test is performed by gently swabbing just inside the nose. The swab is then returned to the laboratory by mail and results are returned to participa nts within days. Participation in the program and all results are confidential, however, positive COVID -19 results must be reported to the local public health authority for case investigation and contact tracing. (More information Free COVID -19 Screening Testing Program for All School Staff ) In addition, the CDC ELC Reopening Schools supplement awarded Oregon $127 million to launch screening in K -12 settings through a phased approach, building on the voluntary program launched in April 2021, and described above. (more information is provided below) Efforts to provide vaccinations to educators, other staff, and students, if eligible Oregon prioritized educators/school staff fo r vaccinations. See this message encouraging vaccination opportunities for students, with a focus on students and families who are disproportionately impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. Appropriate accommodations for children with disabilities with respect to the health and safety policies As of May 31, 2021 If any student requires an accommodation to meet the requirement for face coverings, districts and schools must limit t he student's proximity to students and staff to the 112 extent possible to minimize the possibility of exposure. Appropriate accommodations could include: Offering different types of face coverings and face shields that may meet the needs of the student. Spaces away from peers while the face covering is removed; students must not be left alone or unsupervised. For students with existing medical conditions and a physician's orders to not wear face coverings, or other health related concerns, schools/districts must not deny any in -person instruction. ODE has also provided guidance to schools on Navigating Adaptati on, Accommodation, or Modification for Student Face Covering Requirements. 113 Appendix G: 2020 -21 COVID -19 Targeted Community Engagement C.1.

The Oregon Department of Education conducted robust community engagement throughout the COVID -19 pandemic from March 2020 to May 2021. This table describes how the groups of students listed in the ARP ESSER III Application template were represented in the outreach conducted by the Department. Over t he coming year, each group will be invited to participate in ongoing engagement sessions to further inform the development of the specific strategies for Oregon's state -level funds. Stakeholder Group Artifacts/Staff Students The Department conducted a state -wide survey between June 10, 2020 and July 27, 2020 to collect feedback from the public to improve the RSSL guidance for the 2020 -21 school year. The survey received 15,226 participants, a majority of whom (5,768) were family members of students. Stu dents, educators, administrators, and community members made up the other groups. The input from this survey was presented to the Governor's Healthy Schools Reopening Council in June, July, and August of 2020. ODE staff also used the information to improve iterations of the RSSL guidance and provide support to schools and districts. The Department will consider the best ways to conduct targeted engagement with students and families to inform ESSER III state -level strategies. Many families are also represe nted within The Department's various advisory groups. Families 114 Tribes Government to Government Education Cluster meets at least quarterly to support government relationships between the state of Oregon and the nine federally recognized Tribes in the state. The Department of Education's Indian Education Director has been actively engaging with the Tribes throughout the pandemic.

The American Indian/Alaska Native Advisory Committee met 7 times in 2020 (Jan, Mar, Apr x2, June, Sep, Nov) and has met 4 times in 2021 (Jan, Mar, May, June). This advisory gro up supported the development of the American Indian/Alaska Native Plan which has been used to inform the Department's responsiveness to Native American and Alaska Native students. The Department will utilize existing ongoing engagement as well as invitations to special input sessions with our Tribal education partners to inform ESSER III state -level strategies. Civil Rights Organizations (including disability rights Organizations) The Department invites representatives from these organizations to our community engagement meetings. Staff from these organizations in Oregon serve as members on the 60+ education advisory committees that meet regularly to inform specific policies and initiatives affecting the students they represent. In addition, the Department invites Oregon's civil rights organizations to send representatives to parti cipate in special engagement sessions. The Department will continue to invite these groups to special input sessions to inform ESSER III state -level strategies. School and district administrators (including special education administrators) The Departmen t held meetings to inform and engage school and district leaders on a regular basis throughout the pandemic. Beginning September 2020, weekly office hours were offered to all education leaders in the state. The communications, slide decks, and recordings are all available and archived on the Department's COVID -19 News and Updates webpage . The Department will continue to offer opportunities for school and district leaders to participate in engagement sessions that will inform ESSER III state -level strategies. Superintendents The Department and COSA co -hosted and facilitated weekly meetings for Superintendents in the beginning of the COVID -19 pandemic to 115 provide updates and solicit feedback on guidance. These meetings continued throughout the 2020 -21 school year at least monthly, often every other week. In addition to these meetings, the Department hosted weekly office hours for district leaders and target ed engagement sessions to districts by size (small, medium, and large districts). The Department will continue to partner with COSA to facilitate regular meetings with superintendents and host engagement sessions with school and district leaders to inform ESSER III state -level strategies. Charter school leaders More than 45 charter school meetings were hosted between March 2020 and May 2021. Charter school leaders were also invited to attend some of the critical Superintendent's meetings with ODE and COSA. The Department will continue to invite public charter school leaders to engagement sessions and provide office hours to school leaders as needed. Teachers, principals, school leaders, other educators, school staff, and their unions Leaders from the Oregon Department of Education and Oregon Health Authority engaged teachers from across the state through a series of six virtual meetings in December 2020.
