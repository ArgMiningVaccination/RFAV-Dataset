Ayurveda tells us why we must live in harmony with nature: Within the body, there is a rhythm, a natural basic rhythm that governs our natural urges. Our natural urges are food, sex, and sleep. They can also be seen as digestion, creativity, and rest. These are the pillars of life as we can digest food and information is a healthful way while we create our life and vision but also procreate. But then we need rest to regenerate and rejuvenate. While we all have unique rhythms based on our constitution, our basic rhythms need to be in harmony for our more subtle rhythms to manifest. Through improper training, we have lost touch with our natural basic rhythms and, as a result, with our more subtle unique rhythms. Artificial rhythms created by our society and our own desires to overindulge in our urges have led to this loss. The first step towards getting back in touch with our unique rhythm is to create a routine based on the natural basic rhythms, then our subtle unique rhythm will slowly begin to emerge. Ayurveda provides us with a map to our natural basic rhythms. Through this routine, we can begin to bring balance to the doshas (constitution) and re-create a life of health and happiness. After a thorough initial ayurvedic consultation including pulse and tongue analysis your dosha or constitution is revealed and Dr. Mahdavi will give you life style, daily routines and dietary recommendations in harmony with your individual nature. A customized food, yoga and meditation daily practice is also included is designed for your individual nature. Contact us for a comprehensive consultation and examination. "}
