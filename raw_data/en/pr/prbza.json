The new clinic, which will be called the Medical Care Rehabilitative Center, is to be the first Integrative Medicine clinic in Israel. What is Integrative Rehabilitation and how does it differ from regular rehabilitation?Research has proven time and again that there is a direct link between emotional challenges and burdens, such as enduring continuous strenuous stress, and the onset of diseases with challenging recovery trajectories. Emotional burdens, when left unprocessed or untreated, may sometimes develop into physical discomfort, sleeplessness, distress, and can ultimately morph into physical illness. Integrative Medicine (IM) is a wellness approach that argues that treating physical symptoms or problems is not enough. Meaning, the emotional response surrounding illness needs to be treated as well, given how emotional conditions are so [deeply connected and related to physical conditions](https://www.jpost.com/magazine/the-mind-body-connection-psychological-interventions-that-help-people-with-multiple-sclerosis-515565). At the same time, practitioners will give the same attention to awareness treatments - based on the InHeal approach - focused on identifying and addressing the core of unprocessed emotional crises experienced by the patients and their close relatives.\"We believe that family members and staff members, and not only the patients, go through emotionally challenging situations, as partners and recovery agents, exposed to a serious illness of a loved one. Therefore, it is equally important to address their needs too. Once this emotional burden is addressed, their capacity to provide care for the patient is dramatically improved, as well as their capacity to manage themselves in those difficult times,\" stated Shauli Yaniv Paz, CEO of Medical Care.
