A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications. It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, and materials sciences. This Program Element also supports innovation and robust transition planning in the technology cycle by working with entrepreneurs to increase the likelihood that DARPA funded technologies take root in the U.S. and provide new capabilities for national defense. The Math and Computer Sciences project supports scientific study and experimentation on new mathematical and computational algorithms, models, and mechanisms in support of long-term national security objectives. Modern analytic and information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness. Conversely, new classes of threats, in particular threats that operate in or through the cyber domain, put military systems, critical infrastructure, and the civilian economy at risk. This project aims to magnify these opportunities and mitigate these threats by leveraging emerging mathematical and computational capabilities including artificial intelligence (AI), computational social science, machine learning and reasoning, data science, quantum science, complex systems modeling and simulation, and theories of computation and programming. The basic research conducted under the Math and Computer Sciences project will produce breakthroughs that enable new capabilities for national and homeland security. The Electronic Sciences project is for basic exploration of electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits, and processing concepts to meet the military's need for near real-time information gathering, transmission, and processing. In seeking to continue the phenomenal advancement in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions. The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems. Research areas include: analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer Volume 1 - 1 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 2 of 38 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2023 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide / BA 1: Basic ResearchR-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0601101E / DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems. Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, ultra-high density information storage \"on-a-chip\", and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices. The Beyond Scaling Sciences project supports investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon transistor scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through new non-volatile memory devices that combine computation and memory, and new automated design tools using machine learning. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas. The Materials Sciences project provides the fundamental research that underpins the design, development, assembly, and optimization of advanced materials, devices, and systems for DoD applications in areas such as robust diagnostics and therapeutics, novel energetic materials, and complex hybrid systems. The Transformative Sciences project supports research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in information-intensive subareas of the social sciences, life sciences, and manufacturing. The project integrates these diverse disciplines to eliminate reliance on foreign sources for critical materials, improve military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging/converging trends, especially trends that have the potential to disrupt military operations or threaten National Security. Specific research in this project will investigate technologies to enable detection of novel threat agents (e.g., bacterial pathogens) and maintain warfighter health and improve recovery. This project also includes efforts to create innovative materials of interest to the military, as well as biological platforms for fabrication. B.

One focus area of this thrust is the ability to detect and accommodate novelty - i.e., violations of implicit or explicit assumptions - in AI applications. Another focus area is the development of a model framework for quantifying performance expectations and limits of AI systems as trusted human partners and collaborators. A third focus area is the development of new tools and methodologies that enable AI approaches for accelerated scientific discovery. The technology advances achieved under the Foundational AI Science thrust will ultimately remove technical barriers to exploiting AI technologies for scientific discovery, human-AI collaboration, accommodating novelties, and other DoD relevant applications.

For example, simulation of complex nonlinear phenomena such as turbulence, fluid flow, and plasma dynamics can be challenging even using currently available high power computing resources. Building on technologies developed under the Advanced Tools for Modeling and Simulation thrust, also in this PE/Project, the goal of the Alternative Computing thrust is to develop novel architectural and algorithmic approaches to enable fast and accurate simulations for problems that are practically intractable using electronic computers. Approaches considered under this thrust include the following: (1) analog computing substrates for efficiently simulating systems governed by complex non-linear phenomena; (2) multi-functional spin-based devices for scalable, efficient neuromorphic computing; (3) computing approaches that exploit the capacity of nonlinear systems to simulate nonlinear dynamical systems; and (4) quantum enabled optimization of complex systems.

FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: Task Guidance (PTG) Description: The Perceptually-Enabled Task Guidance (PTG) program is developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology that guides users in the performance of a wide range of cognitively challenging physical tasks. PTG leverages recent advances in machine perception, automated reasoning, and augmented reality. The program will connect perception to reasoning and reasoning to augmented reality (AR) so as to create personalized, real-time feedback and contextualized assistance. To connect perception and reasoning, PTG will develop AI technologies for (1) perceptual grounding, to create a shared vocabulary for perception and reasoning, and (2) perceptual attention, to select important information from large volumes of perceptual data. To connect reasoning with AR, PTG will develop AI technologies for (3) knowledge transfer, to derive task models from instructions intended for humans, and (4) user modeling, to determine if, when, and how to best convey task information to the user. Together, the PTG technologies will lay the foundation for perceptually-enabled guidance and a qualitatively new type of AI device that enables mechanics, medics, and other military specialists to perform physical tasks within and beyond their skillsets with greater accuracy and efficiency. FY 2022 Plans: - Explore rule-based and statistical AI approaches for perceptual grounding, to create a shared vocabulary for perception and reasoning, and perceptual attention, to select important information from the large volumes of perceptual data.6.330 12.234 17.300 Volume 1 - 8 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 9 of 38 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE RESEARCH SCI ENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B.

FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 increase reflects continued effort to develop foundational techniques for perceptually-enabled intelligent agents and increased efforts to integrate and demonstrate the techniques on surrogate and military task use cases. Title: Machine Common Sense (MCS) Description: The Machine Common Sense (MCS) program is exploring approaches to enable common sense reasoning by machines. Recent advances in machine learning have resulted in new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities in areas such as image recognition, task-focused natural language processing, and strategy games such as Chess, Go, and Poker. In all of these application domains, the machine reasoning is narrow and highly specialized, and the machine must be carefully trained or programmed for every situation. This program addresses the challenge of general machine reasoning on par with common sense human cognition. MCS is developing computational models that mimic core systems of human cognitive development that are grounded in perceptual, motor, and memory modalities; a simulated interaction and learning environment to support machine manipulation of grounded concept models; and common sense knowledge repositories to support AI system development. AI systems that are capable of human-like reasoning will be able to behave more appropriately in unforeseen situations and to learn with reduced requirements for training data.

Title: Guaranteeing AI Robustness against Deception (GARD) Description: The Guaranteeing AI Robustness against Deception (GARD) program is developing techniques to defend against deception and other adversarial attacks on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. GARD addresses the need to defend against deception attacks, whereby an adversary inputs engineered data into an ML system intending to cause the system to produce erroneous results. Deception attacks can enable adversaries to take control of autonomous systems, alter conclusions of ML-based decision support applications, and compromise tools and systems that rely on ML and AI technologies. Current techniques for defending ML and AI have proven brittle due to a focus on individual attack methods and weak methods for testing and evaluation. The GARD program is developing techniques that address the current limitations of defenses and produce ML and AI systems suitable for use in adversarial environments. The GARD program is also developing theory regarding potential fundamental limits on achievable ML robustness.15.400 17.500 17.000 Volume 1 - 10 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 11 of 38 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE RESEARCH SCI ENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B.

Title: Artificial Social Intelligence for Successful Teams (ASIST) Description: The Artificial Social Intelligence for Successful Teams (ASIST) program is developing intelligent software agents that can create shared mental models to enable effective teaming with humans. Theory of mind and the ability to create shared mental models are key elements of human social intelligence. Together these capabilities enable human collaboration and teamwork at all scales, whether the setting is a playing field or a military mission. The ASIST program aims to develop technologies to enable machines to exhibit similar capabilities for collaboration and teamwork with humans, capabilities which can be termed artificial social intelligence. These include the capability to infer the goals and situational knowledge of human partners, to predict what human partners will need, and to formulate context-aware actions having high value to team outcomes. The ASIST program is developing proof-of-concept software agents that demonstrate a machine theory of mind and the capability to participate with humans in an effective team by representing and helping to maintain shared mental models.

Title: Human Social Systems Description: The social sciences provide essential theories and models that can enable deeper understanding of human social systems and behaviors relevant to national security such as humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and stability support missions, as well as tactical, operational, strategic, and policy-level decision-making across the DoD. However, current limitations to the speed, scalability, and reproducibility of empirical social science research continue to hamper its practical use by the DoD. Additionally, current social behavioral models often fail to accurately interpret social behaviors because they do not sufficiently capture diversity of context. The Human Social Systems thrust will address these limitations by focusing on the following technical challenges: (1) developing and validating new methods, models and tools to perform rigorous, reproducible experimental research at scales necessary to understand emergent properties of human social systems; (2) identifying methods to better characterize and quantify properties, dynamics, and behaviors of different social systems to enable better and more confident forecasting of changes in social systems, particularly when under stress; (3) developing an understanding of the complex effect of context and incorporating these effects into social science models; and (4) developing strategic forecasting and operational decision aiding capabilities that account for local contextual and cultural factors to assess the likely effectiveness of and/or responses to actions within an Area of Operations. This research thrust will provide DoD with new, reliable strategies to better understand and respond to social system issues at multiple scales (from small group to cities and/or regions) and will significantly improve DoD stabilization, deterrence, and/or gray zone mission outcomes. FY 2022 Plans: - Test algorithms for automatically assigning quantitative confidence scores to social and behavioral science research. - Analyze expert and non-expert usability and explainability of algorithms for automatically assigning quantitative confidence scores. - Validate increased efficiency of algorithms for automatically assigning quantitative confidence scores to social and behavioral science research. - Evaluate the accuracy of developed causal models of regional socioeconomic systems in representing the collective implicit casual models held by locals to the region. - Investigate the amount of information that can be gathered remotely versus what must be gathered locally to create accurate, causal models of local socioeconomic systems. - Demonstrate that mechanisms developed for engaging local populations are compatible with local infrastructure. - Scope testbed for developing and understanding what metrics are appropriate for measuring the impact of actions such as in Influence Operations. - Explore external and internal validity of social influence metrics within testbed.

FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 decrease reflects a shift from development to demonstration. Title: Safe Documents (SafeDocs) Description: The Safe Documents (SafeDocs) program is developing software technologies that constrain syntactic complexity in data exchange formats, and improve the capability to reject invalid and maliciously crafted data in electronic documents and streaming data. The high complexity and unmanaged evolution of electronic document formats and streaming data protocols greatly increase the computational attack surface. The SafeDocs program is rationalizing existing data exchange formats significant to the defense mission, with attention to compatibility, and advancing the state of the art in the security of document and data format parsers. SafeDocs advances will enable automated code verification, assure that the conditions of data validity are enforced, and secure documents and streaming data.

Title: Learning with Less Labeling (LwLL) Description: The Learning with Less Labeling (LwLL) program is developing technology to greatly reduce the amount of labeled data required to train machine learning (ML) systems. In supervised ML, a system learns through the use of labeled training examples to recognize and categorize attributes of images, text, or speech. Humans provide these training-data examples to ML systems and, with enough labeled data, it is generally possible to build useful models. Obtaining large amounts of labeled data can be costly, particularly for national security applications. LwLL is addressing this problem by creating ML algorithms that learn and adapt more efficiently than current ML approaches, and by formally deriving the limits of machine learning and adaptation. These algorithms achieve the goals through training with a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. LwLL aims to create ML systems that are easier to train for use in variable, unpredictable, real-world environments where training data is costly or sparse. FY 2022 Plans: - Develop approaches to optimize label reduction in ML algorithms and to simultaneously achieve performance near theoretical limits. - Demonstrate new ML algorithms that retain state-of-the-art performance even with several orders of magnitude reduction in labeled training data. - Demonstrate the generalization capability of new ML algorithms across multiple tasks. FY 2023 Plans: - Demonstrate ML systems that require less labeled training data in multiple domains relevant to the DoD, and transition technology to the DoD and industry.

To achieve this, PROVERS will focus on creating and sustaining a body of evidence that can co-evolve with the system under change to support continuous assessment and ensure that the system remains free of identified categories of defects and security vulnerabilities through its lifetime. Key PROVERS objectives include enabling proof maintenance and repair capabilities at a cost that is proportionate to code change; integration of formal methods with code, properties, and proofs in a single workflow that reduces human involvement; providing improved explanations to facilitate proof repair; and automating formal methods-based software analysis to support software developers that are not formal methods experts. PROVERS technologies will facilitate the agile development and continuous improvement of mission-critical software systems that meet the high security and quality standards required by the DoD. FY 2023 Plans: - Explore formal methods approaches and develop tools and data management techniques appropriate for pipelined software development processes and incremental proof maintenance and repair. - Formulate mathematical approaches for proof engineering at scale including techniques such as distributed proofs. - Identify candidate mission-critical software applications and systems for controlled formal-methods-based experiments with the goal of quantifying the improvements in development productivity and system security. FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 increase reflects program initiation. Title: World Modelers Description: The World Modelers program is creating explanatory models for complex natural and human-mediated systems at regional and global scales. Because of macro-economic interdependence, widespread consequences can result from the disruption of natural resources, supply chains, and production systems. World Modelers capabilities are focused on regional and global systems with the goal of generating timely indications and warnings. Water and food security are application domains of particular interest, as persistent drought may cause crops to fail, leading to migration and regional conflicts. The World Modelers program aims to develop techniques for automating the creation, maintenance, and validation of large-scale integrated models using publicly available news and analyst reports as a structuring mechanism, and government and commercial data as quantitative inputs. FY 2022 Plans: - Integrate software capabilities applicable to the diverse data and modeling tasks encountered in high-priority use cases. - Demonstrate modeling modalities in support of analytic workflows in diverse domains and optimize techniques in response to user feedback.13.700 12.000 - Volume 1 - 17 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 18 of 38 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE RESEARCH SCI ENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B.

Title: Analyzing Software to Protect against Evolving Cyber Threats (ASPECT) Description: The Analyzing Software to Protect against Evolving Cyber Threats (ASPECT) program is developing technologies to enable software developers to pose in-depth queries of code under development and sustainment in order to discover negative patterns, capture the semantic features of vulnerability classes, and characterize undesirable behaviors. ASPECT technologies will enable developers to generate the types of evidence required for confident certification, thereby improving software quality and assurance. At present, software faults and vulnerabilities are often unwittingly propagated throughout the software ecosystem because they are not easily discovered in codebases and because developers have strong incentives to re-use code and programming patterns. Moreover, searching for faults and vulnerabilities in software is impractical because these flaws are not manifest through the syntax of the source code but rather through the behaviors encoded in the software, i.e., in the software semantics. ASPECT will enable developers to query software at this deeper semantic level by developing modeling languages for the semantics of code and programs; representing code and programs in terms of their semantics; and identifying negative patterns, potential vulnerabilities, and undesirable behaviors. FY 2022 Plans: - Develop semantically-based metrics of software quality and evidence management techniques that provide actionable or otherwise useful information for software developers. - Identify categories of latent vulnerabilities including syntactically-distinct but semantically-equivalent reflects program completion.4.000 8.500 - Title: Advanced Tools for Modeling and Simulation Description: The Advanced Tools for Modeling and Simulation thrust is developing foundational mathematical, computational, and multi-physics theories, approaches, and tools to better represent, quantify, and model complex DoD systems from multimodal data analysis through part/system design and fabrication. One focus area of this thrust is developing a unified mathematical framework to enable better visualization and analysis of massive, complex data sets. Rigorous mathematical theories are also being developed to address uncertainty in the modeling and design of complex multi-scale physical and engineering systems, incorporating capabilities to handle noisy data and model uncertainty that are well beyond the scope of current capabilities.

Title: Synergistic Discovery and Design (SD2) Description: The Synergistic Discovery and Design (SD2) program developed data-driven methods to accelerate scientific discovery and robust design in domains that lack complete models. Engineers regularly use high-fidelity simulations to create robust designs in complex domains such as aeronautics and integrated circuits. In contrast, robust design remains elusive in domains such as synthetic biology, neuro-computation, and synthetic chemistry due to the lack of high-fidelity models. The SD2 program developed technologies to collect raw experimental data into a data and analysis hub, computational techniques that extract scientific knowledge directly from experimental data, and data sharing tools and metrics that facilitate collaborative design. SD2 application domains include synthetic biology, solar cell chemistry, and protein design, which will impact future DoD capabilities in areas such as chemical and biological defense, and warfighter readiness.16.000 - - Title: Complex Hybrid Systems Description: The Complex Hybrid Systems program was focused on exploring fundamental science, mathematics, and computational approaches to collectives, complex hybrid (e.g., human-machine) systems and systems-of-systems across a variety of DoD-relevant domains.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Electronic Sciences project is for basic exploration of electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits, and processing concepts to meet the military's need for near real-time information gathering, transmission, and processing. In seeking to continue the phenomenal advancement in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions. The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems. Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems. Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, ultra-high density information storage \"on-a-chip\", and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ Integration (A-PhI) program is reducing the size, weight, and power of atomic clocks and gyroscopes for position, navigation, and timing (PNT) applications through the development of integrated photonics. Specifically, A-PhI will demonstrate that a compact photonic integrated chip can replace the optical assembly for trapped atomic gyroscopes and clocks without degrading the performance of the device. PNT is a critical resource for all DoD missions such as communications, navigation, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare. While PNT needs usually are met by using the global positioning system (GPS), GPS signals are vulnerable to a variety of disruption modalities and a fallback from GPS is essential. In the absence of GPS, tactical grade clocks and tactical/navigation grade inertial measurement units (IMUs) currently can provide GPS-like accuracy only for the short term, and longer-term GPS independent strategies are highly desirable. A-PhI will enable long-term GPS independence and enable better-than-GPS PNT accuracy for short durations. FY 2022 Plans: - Demonstrate an atomic clock physics package meeting size, frequency stability, and phase noise metrics. - Improve atom trap gyroscope sensitivity. FY 2023 Plans: - Demonstrate a trapped atom gyroscope with single measurement angle rate resolution and scale factor exceeding commercial gyroscopes. - Test integrated photonics based atomic clock by referencing to civilian and military time standards at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and United States Naval Observatory (UNSO).14.681 9.361 9.000 Volume 1 - 22 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 23 of 38 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE SCI ENCESProject (Number/Name) ES-01 / ELECTRONIC SCIENCES B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Beyond Scaling Sciences project supports investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon transistor scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through new non-volatile memory devices that combine computation and memory, and new automated design tools using machine learning. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Additionally, new design and manufacturing advances for three-dimensional microelectronics integration will underpin continued performance improvements as silicon transistor scaling plateaus. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas. B.

The DoD has long recognized the warfighter's outsized risk of exposure to biological threat agents and to infectious disease, including the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) organisms that are ranked as a Tier 1 threat to the U.S. military. Similarly, the danger posed by bacterial biothreats persists with few countermeasures available. Key advances expected from this research include identifying methods to discover and develop new classes of therapeutics for AMR bacteria, bacterial biothreats, and other DoD-relevant diseases and threats. These approaches represent a significant departure from conventional therapeutics, which typically rely on a limited number of small molecules with a narrow set of targets and mechanism of action. Advances in this area may be applied to the mitigation of known, new, and emerging diseases that impact military readiness and pose a global health threat.

Title: Outpacing Infectious Disease Description: Military readiness and national security depend on the health and well-being of military service members. Unfortunately, today's antivirals and vaccines are often circumvented by fast-mutating viruses that evolve to develop drug resistance. Military service members often deploy to areas with such diseases that require new protective measures to maintain readiness. The Outpacing Infectious Disease program is investigating fundamental methods for using biology as a technology to create adaptive therapeutic response mechanisms to outpace viral diseases such as enabling co-evolution and co-transmission of newly developed therapeutics to ultimately outcompete the pathogen. Key advances expected from this research include identifying methods to discover and develop new classes of dynamic therapeutics for fast-mutating viruses. This approach represents a significant departure from conventional antiviral therapies, which typically rely on static solutions and continuous re- formulation and re-development in attempt to keep pace with emerging strains and disease variants. Advances in this area may be applied to the mitigation of known, new, or emerging diseases that impact military readiness and pose a national security risk as a potential pandemic.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Information and Communications Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research budget activity because it is directed toward the application of advanced, innovative computing systems and communications technologies. This Program Element also supports innovation and robust transition planning in the technology cycle by working with entrepreneurs to increase the likelihood that DARPA funded technologies take root in the U.S. and provide new capabilities for national defense. The High Productivity, High-Performance Responsive Architectures project focuses on developing the computer hardware and associated software technologies required for future computationally- and data-intensive national security applications. Powerful new approaches are needed to manage the rapid growth in available sensor data, to leverage advances in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing, and to maintain the security of DoD information systems. The project therefore aims not only to create new computing platforms to include quantum technology, but also to efficiently extract information out of large and chaotic data sets with embedded and low-size, weight, and power systems. Advances in these areas will allow for DoD electronic systems to collaboratively manage scarce resources, such as the electromagnetic spectrum, and to adapt to new requirements and situations. Further, the resulting technologies, by being accessible to a wide range of application developers, will support new, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications. The Cyber Security project is developing the computing, networking, and cyber security technologies required to protect DoD, U.S. government, and U.S. civilian information, information infrastructure, and mission-critical information systems. Information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. industry. Meanwhile, cyber threats grow in sophistication and number, and put sensitive data, classified computer programs, mission- critical information systems, and U.S. economic competitiveness at risk. The technologies developed in this project will enhance the resilience of information systems to current and emerging cyber threats, enable broad situational awareness of the cyber domain, and provide the basis for accurate, calibrated, and safe cyber response. The Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Symbiosis project develops technologies to enable machines to function not only as tools that facilitate human action but as trusted partners to human operators. Of particular interest are systems that can understand human speech and extract information contained in diverse media; Volume 1 - 57 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 2 of 34 R-1 Line #17Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2023 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide / BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0602303E / INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY answer questions, reach conclusions, and propose explanations; and learn, reason, and apply knowledge gained through experience to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events. Enabling computing systems with such human-like intelligence is now of critical importance because the tempo of military operations in emerging domains exceeds that at which unaided humans can orient, understand, and act. The technologies developed in the Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Symbiosis project will enable warfighters to make better decisions in complex, time-critical, battlefield environments; intelligence analysts to make sense of massive, incomplete, and contradictory information; software developers and certifiers to design, implement, evaluate, and accredit cyber-physical systems and other complex software-reliant systems with greater efficiency and confidence; and unmanned systems and semi-autonomous agents to perform critical missions in contested physical and virtual environments safely and reliably.

It is currently expected that this type of machine will not be realized for at least 10 years and as long as 40 years. As a result, the unexpected and near-term development of a scalable, fault- tolerant quantum computer represents a strategic surprise for the United States. In addition, if quantum computers are shown to have transformative potential for critical problems facing the United States, it is in the Government's interest to foster and accelerate commercial progress towards a truly useful, \"utility-scale\" quantum computer. Initiated under Alternative Computing to both reduce strategic risk and realize transformative opportunity, the US2QC thrust will (1) evaluate disruptive designs for utility- scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers, specifically, systems that can be constructed in less than 10 years; (2) demonstrate each of the enabling sub-systems and components for these designs; and (3) construct a prototype fault-tolerant quantum computer that demonstrates that utility-scale design is viable.- - 11.250 Volume 1 - 60 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 5 of 34 R-1 Line #17Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / TECHNOLOGYProject (Number/Name) / HIGH PRODUCTIVITY, HIGH- PERFORMANCE RESPONSIVE ARCHITECTURES B.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2021 The Open, Programmable, Secure 5G (OPS-5G) program is developing open source, 5G network software that ensures security and stimulates innovation in mobile wireless hardware. Current trends in mobile wireless technology development are unfavorable in that the U.S. and allies are increasingly dependent on proprietary technologies offered by foreign suppliers. OPS-5G will develop standards-compliant software for 5G mobile wireless networks that is open source, programmable, and secure by design. The availability of open source software for 5G will have the additional benefit of opening the mobile wireless hardware market to new participants, stimulating innovation and competition. The OPS-5G program aims to move the mobile wireless market off its current model of opaque, proprietary, and vertically-integrated technology provided by a small number of dominant vendors to a more robust model with increased transparency and open source technology created by a diverse ecosystem of academic and commercial software and hardware developers. OPS-5G will be coordinated with existing open-source 5G efforts and U.S. Government, DoD, and industry stakeholders. FY 2022 Plans: - Implement and evaluate prototype systems that address 5G security challenges, such as eavesdropping at access points and denial of service. - Implement and evaluate prototype software for automatically extracting information relevant to software implementations including software structure, service interfaces, timing parameters, flow diagrams, and protocol graphs from electronic 5G standards. - Implement, evaluate, and demonstrate 5G node and network security technologies and tools for integrity checks, attack prevention, remote diagnosis, and service recovery.13.300 21.000 28.300 Volume 1 - 62 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 7 of 34 R-1 Line #17Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / Millions) FY 2021 FY 2022 FY 2023 - Assess and develop information protection techniques suitable for current and future mobile wireless systems to support DoD operational security needs.

Title: Verified Security and Performance Enhancement of Large Legacy Software (V-SPELLS) Description: The Verified Security and Performance Enhancement of Large Legacy Software (V-SPELLS) program is creating methods and tools to recover succinct models of domain data abstractions and logic from source code, add enhancements to the models, and convert them to performant new component implementations verified to be compatible and secure. DoD has a critical need for replacing or reworking components of existing software with more secure and more performant code, including cases where a key performance or security benefit comes from moving parts of the software to new hardware, such as utilizing hardware accelerators, isolation enclaves, offload processors, and distributed computation. However, at present, enhancing legacy software components faces high risk that the new software will not be fully compatible with the existing larger environment. Moreover, verified software is currently written from scratch, starting with a formal specification, rather than incrementally added to a system as provably compatible enhancements. V-SPELLS will address these problems by combining novel concepts in verified programming with recent developments in domain specific languages (DSLs) and systems architecture. V-SPELLS aims to enable piecewise, compatible-by-construction improvement of software components in legacy DoD systems, providing to incremental software (re)engineering the benefits of formal software verification currently available only to clean-slate development efforts. FY 2022 Plans: - Implement automated techniques for decomposing legacy code into functional modules with domain data structure and operation definitions, untangling of legacy code into low-level domain operation implementations and higher-level application logic, and lifting of legacy code into an extracted DSL. - Develop and formally ground software compartmentalization techniques for subdividing software systems into isolated compartments with limited interconnections intended to minimize privilege and thereby mitigate the impact of software compromise. - Create an initial development environment for convergent DSL programming, including compatibility-centric program analysis techniques that provide efficient, intelligible feedback and refined counterexamples to developers. - Identify DoD software environments that would benefit from recoding selected legacy components using DSLs for packet filtering, data, signal, and image processing, and other latency-sensitive/security-critical functions. FY 2023 Plans: - Formulate a quantitative assessment framework for cyber risk factors, encompassing threat, consequence, and vulnerability, to enable more rigorous assessments of architectural alternatives and guide choices in software systems engineering. - Refine automated techniques for decomposing legacy code into functional modules with domain data structure and operation definitions, enabling safe replacement and enhancement of targeted components with high-level DSL code.9.800 14.750 19.000 Volume 1 - 64 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 9 of 34 R-1 Line #17Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / Millions) FY 2021 FY 2022 FY 2023 - Integrate development environment for convergent DSL programming with decomposition tools that automate program understanding and downstream compilation tools that produce executable artifacts. - Apply tools to DoD legacy components in order to enhance security and performance while ensuring compositional correctness and safety. FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 increase reflects ramping up of work to develop automated techniques for decomposing legacy code into functional modules, compilation techniques for DSL virtual machine stacks, and an initial development environment. Title: Securing Information for Encrypted Verification and Evaluation (SIEVE) Description: The Securing Information for Encrypted Verification and Evaluation (SIEVE) program is developing technology to enable the creation of mathematically verifiable public statements derived from sensitive information that remains hidden. To accomplish this, SIEVE will produce advances in a cryptographic technique known as zero knowledge (ZK) proofs, which simultaneously enable mathematical verification of public statements while provably hiding the sensitive information from which the statement is derived. The advances produced by SIEVE will make it possible and operationally feasible to verify statements substantially more complex than the current ZK state of the art supports, for example, statements about a software vulnerability that do not reveal details of how the vulnerability can be exploited. FY 2022 Plans: - Extend ZK proof compilers by adding problem classes as well as reducing representation size of proof statements by orders of magnitude. - Optimize post-quantum analyses to reduce theoretical proof complexity for important use cases. - Enhance techniques to permit optimization for any subset of prover computation, verifier computation, total communication, and total number of communication rounds. - Apply ZK proof techniques to additional DoD and U.S. Government use cases and evaluate their functionality, information leakage potential, and robustness to attack in collaboration with potential transition partners. FY 2023 Plans: - Extend ZK proof compilers to additional problem classes and to accommodate probabilistic problem statements. - Further enhance post-quantum analyses to reduce theoretical proof complexity for important use cases and potential transition partners. - Scale-up ZK proof techniques to realistic DoD and U.S. Government use cases and evaluate their functionality, information leakage, and robustness to attack in collaboration with potential transition partners.14.500 16.000 17.500 Volume 1 - 65 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 10 of 34 R-1 Line #17Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / Millions) FY 2021 FY 2022 FY 2023 - Determine the feasibility of efficient, end to end verifiable, distributed architectures for private data communication that can be leveraged by overseas personnel and compatible with existing state and federal policies and regulations. FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 increase reflects additional effort to evaluate ZK proof techniques on realistic use cases. Title: Assured Micropatching (AMP) Description: The Assured Micropatching (AMP) program is developing technologies to enable the rapid production of targeted micropatches to repair legacy program binaries with strong guarantees. At present, the emergency patching of legacy software, even if all relevant information is available, creates too much uncertainty and takes far too long to validate, leaving critical systems with known flaws vulnerable to adversary attack. AMP will create the capability to analyze, modify, and fix legacy software in binary form even when the original source code and/or build process is not fully available. The AMP technical approach involves automatic discovery of known vulnerable components, goal-driven decompilation to isolate and analyze the vulnerable binary components, and minimal-change patching and recompilation to rebuild affected binaries with strong guarantees that the patch will not impair the functions of the system. The technologies developed by AMP aim to enable cyber defenders to quickly and accurately patch legacy binaries in the deployed software systems upon which our military depends. FY 2022 Plans: - Develop a modeling capability to infer compiler optimization effects on the call graph structure, and probabilistic graph-matching and inference algorithms to produce candidate matches between the target binary procedures and most likely source code procedures. - Develop extensions to commonly used binary analysis tools to interactively show the effects of an applied micropatch. - Conduct a challenge event using a commodity controller and data logger based on a widely-used commercial data bus architecture. FY 2023 Plans: - Enable and demonstrate the automatic patching of vulnerabilities where exploitation does not involve memory corruption. - Improve and optimize the existing intermediate representations and optimize the location of the provided patch within the original binary. - Conduct a challenge event using a real-time control device in use in a cyber physical system.

Today's network and computing subsystems are badly out of balance with each other, a result of incremental technology advances in networking and computing market silos. This has produced a bottleneck at the network interface used to connect a machine to an external network, severely limiting the input/output capability. FastNICs will develop new input/output technologies based on more realistic models of complex multiprocessor compute, interconnect, and memory subsystems. FastNICs aims to enable a dramatic increase in computational throughput for distributed applications such as training of machine learning systems. FY 2022 Plans: - Evaluate network interface architecture alternatives such as busses and parallelism. - Demonstrate versions of widely used distributed systems software and operating systems that accommodate massively parallel input data streams. - Demonstrate and evaluate distributed computing applications of interest to the DoD such as training deep learning systems.

Title: Cyber-Hunting at Scale (CHASE) Description: The Cyber-Hunting at Scale (CHASE) program is developing data-driven tools for real-time cyber threat detection, characterization, and protection within enterprise-scale networks. U.S. computer networks are continually under attack, but at present there are few capabilities to efficiently extract and analyze the right data from the right device at the right time for DoD- scale information networks. For example, analysis of an in-memory exploit requires detailed data from a few devices, while analysis of a global botnet attack requires summary data from a great many devices. CHASE is developing novel algorithms and analysis tools to dynamically collect data from across the network, actively hunt for advanced threats that evade routine security measures, and automatically disseminate protective measures that bolster the collective cyber defense posture. FY 2022 Plans: - Develop an analyst interface to enable automated cyber report generation, and evaluate the utility of the interface for cyber threat detection and protective measure dissemination. - Develop techniques for quantifying and reducing the risk of cyber operations. - Identify transition opportunities for validated threat detection, threat characterization, and data planning algorithms. FY 2023 Plans: - Integrate threat detection, data retention, and global analysis methods, and harden capabilities for transition to DoD stakeholders.16.140 15.100 7.100 Volume 1 - 68 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 13 of 34 R-1 Line #17Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / Millions) FY 2021 FY 2022 FY 2023 - Transition cyber threat detection and protective measure dissemination technologies to DoD stakeholders.

Title: Memory Optimization (MemOp) Description: The Memory Optimization (MemOp) program is developing technology to optimize memory transactions in large scale computing systems. The demand for computing services is growing within both the U.S. Government and commercial industry. In response, new technical approaches are being developed to provide massive computation efficiently and cost effectively. In particular, distributed data centers with high-speed interconnects and customizable hardware, including graphics processing units (GPU) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), are being used by service providers to achieve greater efficiency and improved processing performance. MemOp is exploring new memory architectures that more fully leverage emerging customizable hardware to deliver computing services reliably and at reduced cost. The more promising MemOp memory architectures will be implemented and evaluated in hardware and software. The technologies developed in MemOp will provide enhanced efficiency and improved performance for large scale computing systems.

FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 decrease reflects ramping down of work to develop and integrate technologies in a proof-of-concept, computer- human software reasoning system, and focus shifting to hardening, demonstration, and transition to the DoD and IC. Title: Cora Description: The Cora program is developing technologies to enable machines to read heterogeneous text-based data sources, extract key entities and activities, and characterize cyber threats. Large volumes of text-based data contain scattered clues about the activities of cyber threats. Automated machine reading and analysis capabilities are required due to the extreme rates at which this text-based data is generated. In addition, the connections between extracted entities and their activities can be very subtle and, because they are buried in noise, difficult to detect and correlate. The Cora technologies will benefit cyber analysts by providing them with pre-processed cyber leads that otherwise might not be available. FY 2022 Plans: - Demonstrate scalability and performance of analytical capabilities on relevant large-scale data sets. - Evaluate machine-learning-based methods for identifying cyber threats across heterogeneous data, in multiple languages. - Harden cyber analytical software technologies and incorporate refinements requested by cyber operators.

FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 decrease reflects ramping down of efforts to implement and evaluate an integrated cyber analytical system, and focus shifting to demonstration and transition to operational partners. Title: Searchlight Description: The Searchlight program is developing technologies to ensure that quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees are met for distributed applications operating across the Internet. The increasing use of Internet-based distributed applications creates risks as surges in network use can result in resource shortfalls. Searchlight will develop novel approaches for allocating inherently limited network resources to optimize the performance of distributed applications. Searchlight techniques and systems aim to enable organizations to adapt the QoS for their low-priority traffic resulting in improved QoS for their high-priority traffic without affecting traffic from other Internet users. Searchlight technologies will become increasingly important as 5G systems provide advanced capabilities for organizations to adapt their QoS guarantees. FY 2022 Plans: - Improve integrated QoS management system performance in terms of scale, application identification accuracy, and application responsiveness. - Demonstrate the integrated QoS management system and evaluate its capability on heterogeneous applications distributed across wide area networks of realistic scale and complexity. - Work with transition partners to optimize the QoS management system to relevant use cases, applications, and network characteristics. FY 2023 Plans: - Demonstrate techniques for topology discovery of multiplexing sites. - Demonstrate an integrated QoS management prototype on relevant use cases and transition to DoD and commercial network service providers. FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 decrease reflects ramping down of work to develop QoS management techniques and focus shifting to transition to the DoD and industry.5.400 6.300 4.800 Title: Active Social Engineering Defense Volume 1 - 71 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 16 of 34 R-1 Line #17Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / FY 2021 FY 2022 FY 2023 Description: The Active Social Engineering Defense (ASED) program is developing technologies to automatically identify, disrupt and investigate social engineering attacks via bot-mediated communications. Social engineering attacks, such as phishing and spear-phishing, typically gain user trust via impersonation to induce behaviors or elicit sensitive information that compromise security of an information system. At present, defending against social engineering attacks falls largely to human users. ASED aims to prevent social engineering attacks by creating counter-social-engineering bots that act on behalf of users to mediate and aggregate communications and auto-identify attackers. ASED aims to greatly reduce the effectiveness of adversary social engineering attacks and improve the security of DoD information systems. FY 2022 Plans: - Demonstrate and evaluate a machine-learning-based social engineering attack detection system, including automated attribution of social engineering attacks, against advanced simulated adversaries who disguise their attacks. - Harden a modular social engineering attack detection and attribution system for use by U.S. Government, DoD, and industry. FY 2023 Plans: - Deploy social engineering attack detection software to a transition partner environment. FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 decrease reflects a shift from development of counter-social-engineering bot technologies to technology hardening and transition to U.S. Government, DoD, and industry. Title: Hardening Development Toolchains Against Emergent Execution Engines (HARDEN) Description: The Hardening Development Toolchains Against Emergent Execution Engines (HARDEN) program, building on results derived in the Foundational Artificial Intelligence (AI) Science program (PE 0601101E, Project CCS-02), will develop techniques and tools to anticipate, isolate, and mitigate emergent system behaviors and thereby improve security of complex integrated software. Today's software development toolchains and testing methodologies provide very limited means for reasoning about adversarial reuse of code as written and designed. This results in unwitting creation of stable, reliable patterns of emergent behaviors within systems that adversaries can reuse in attacks. Examples include web browser exploits, which co-opt the browser's memory management algorithms and web scripts; the Spectre family of exploits; and modern bootkits, which leverage the trusted computing system management modes. In each case, attackers program emergent behaviors already present within the target system. The HARDEN approach to preventing such adversarial code reuse is to create techniques, tools, metadata, and instrumentation for reasoning about emergent execution at all stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC), and for flagging code segments and design patterns where there is high potential for adversarial reuse and emergent execution. To assess their utility, HARDEN technologies will be applied to critical system elements such as bootloaders and to integrated software systems. If successful, the technologies developed by HARDEN will facilitate efficient mitigation of complex code-- 5.000 10.000 Volume 1 - 72 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 17 of 34 R-1 Line #17Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2021 FY reuse and emergent-execution early SDLC stages, and provide the stronger roots-of-trust required by zero-trust architectures and high-assurance integrated military software systems. FY 2022 Plans: - Formulate approaches for instrumenting the development toolchain for reasoning about emergent behaviors at all available layers of abstraction, from the compiled binary code through the compiler abstractions and intermediate representations, to the highest levels of architectural abstraction. FY 2023 Plans: - Develop models and mitigations for composable emergent behaviors and for the reliable chaining of exploit primitives even where the effects of any single behavior or flaw are reduced by security mitigations. - Explore automated techniques for identifying implementations that are likely to result in composable emergent behaviors, and for suggesting transformations of implementations that, while semantically equivalent, mitigate emergent composability and thereby disrupt exploit programming. - Initiate application of concepts and techniques to critical system elements such as bootloaders and high-assurance integrated military software systems with the goal of demonstrating the capability to mitigate complex code-reuse/emergent-execution vulnerabilities at early SDLC Statement: The FY 2023 increase reflects ramping up of work to develop techniques to mitigate emergent behaviors and initial applications of the technology to military and commercial software systems. Title: Signature Management using Operational Knowledge and Environments (SMOKE) Description: The Signature Management using Operational Knowledge and Environments (SMOKE) program seeks to develop signature management technologies that generate evasive cyber infrastructure by incorporating counter-attribution techniques into the design process; quantitatively measuring attribution risk in real-time; and by maintaining evasiveness after infrastructure changes in order to accelerate red team cyber operations (CO) and eliminate signatures as a source of attribution. FY 2023 Plans: - Formulate approaches for quantifying the detection and attribution risks associated with CO infrastructure development and operation. - Develop techniques for identifying patterns characteristic of CO. - Perform red team assessments of CO protection capabilities in collaboration with potential transition partners.

Title: Hardware Optimization (HOP) Description: The Hardware Optimization (HOP) program is developing hardware optimizations for national security purposes. Specifically, HOP will enable new national security workloads in high performance microelectronic hardware. This research will produce end-to-end hardware optimization toolkits to enhance hardware designs. These toolkits will be comprised of algorithms, digital design files, documentation, and binaries. FY 2022 Plans: - Evaluate hardware optimizations to address algorithmic improvements and address scalability and performance opportunities. - Design and develop initial alternative implementations for hardware optimizations. - Provide initial hardware optimizations for performance assessments and evaluations. FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: reflects program completion.8.000 17.100 Title: Harnessing Autonomy for Countering Cyber-adversary Systems (HACCS) Description: The Harnessing Autonomy for Countering Cyber-adversary Systems (HACCS) program is developing safe and reliable autonomous software agents that can neutralize botnet implants and similar large-scale malware in networked devices. HACCS is developing technologies to (1) identify and characterize botnet-conscripted networks of devices to determine the types of devices and the software services running on them with sufficient precision to infer the presence of known vulnerabilities; (2) generate software exploits for a large number of known vulnerabilities that can be used to establish initial presence in each botnet- conscripted network without disrupting system functionality; and (3) create high-assurance software agents that can autonomously navigate within botnet-conscripted networks, identify botnet implants, and curtail their ability to operate while minimizing side effects to systems and infrastructure. HACCS technologies aim to enable U.S. agencies possessing the appropriate authorities to safely conduct Internet-scale counter-botnet operations. FY 2022 Plans: - Enhance botnet-tracking algorithms to provide near-real-time assessment for the global identification and tracking of all major classes of botnet-conscripted networks. - Collaborate with transition partners to tailor and evaluate HACCS counter-botnet technology in realistic environments. FY 2022 to FY Statement: Intent-Defined Adaptive Software (IDAS) Volume 1 - 74 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 19 of 34 R-1 Line #17Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2021 Description: The Intent-Defined Adaptive Software (IDAS) program is developing technologies to represent the intent of software and its abstract constraints separately from its concrete instantiation, for the purpose of enabling rapid code synthesis and continual adaptation. Modern weapons platforms are increasingly dependent on complex software, increasing the risk of system failures and creating new attack surfaces for adversaries. Software engineers often manage complexity by choosing a particular option that fulfills the immediate needs of the development effort (e.g., by concretization). IDAS will develop techniques for deferring software concretizations until uncertainties are resolved, either at build time or during run time, for complex systems. IDAS technology aims to significantly reduce software development time and maintenance costs, thereby enabling DoD to acquire, sustain, and improve software-based capabilities more cost-effectively. FY 2022 Plans: - Mature algorithmic techniques that permit verified optimization of multiple implementations, and demonstrate more efficient encoding of quality goals and operational constraints. - Demonstrate a prototype of a partially coupled implementation of a military system that has the performance of a highly-coupled, exquisitely engineered system, and the maintainability of a decoupled, modular system. FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 decrease reflects program completion. Title: Configuration Security Description: The Configuration Security program is developing technologies to analyze, monitor, and modify the configuration of composed cyber-physical-human systems to identify system vulnerabilities and minimize the attack surface while maintaining functionality and performance. Complex cyber-physical systems, such as ships, airplanes, and critical infrastructure, increasingly make use of multiple commodity information technology components. The manual configuration necessary to enable each component to interoperate introduces exploitable cyber vulnerabilities, as do the standard operating procedures that system operators follow. The Configuration Security program will develop capabilities to automate the appropriate configuration of such systems within the operational context, ensure secure configuration settings, and prevent malicious changes to these settings. FY 2022 Plans: - Scale and optimize automatic generation of contextualized secure configurations for operationally relevant, complex cyber- physical-human systems, including the translation of multi-vendor, human-readable artifacts into machine-understandable formats. - Demonstrate algorithms to automatically and rapidly reconfigure a representative military operational system to a baseline that is safer, more secure, and more quickly achieved. - Demonstrate a reconfigured system that provides required functionality with automatically-generated human-readable explanations.11.400 6.050 - Volume 1 - 75 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 20 of 34 R-1 Line #17Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / Millions) FY 2021 FY 2022 FY 2023 - Transition a capability to detect and prevent malicious modification of configurations from the system-generated baseline for a shipboard communication system, and to assist system operators in changing between operational contexts. FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 decrease reflects program completion. Title: Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) Description: The Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) program is developing the design, analysis and verification tools needed to allow systems engineers to design-in cyber resiliency and manage tradeoffs as they do other quality attributes when designing complex embedded computing systems. The current state of practice for cyber resilience utilizes penetration testing after system construction to drive post-design re-engineering. The CASE technical approach formulates cyber resilience as an explicitly engineered property, similar to other holistic properties such as safety, durability, and reliability now standard in systems engineering. The challenge of resiliency is that it cannot be established through conventional testing methods. CASE is focusing on the following technical areas: techniques to derive resilience-related requirements before system design and construction; architectural design and analysis tools to design-in the derived resilience requirements while providing feedback to the human designer to allow for informed tradeoffs between resilience and other system design goals; tools to adapt existing software to support system-level resilience requirements; and inference engines, satisfiability solvers, and provers scalable to complex networked cyber-physical systems. CASE technologies will enable the design of cyber-physical systems that robustly execute their intended function despite the efforts of sophisticated cyber adversaries. FY 2022 Plans: - Harden technologies for cyber security systems engineering and transition to DoD stakeholders. FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: Title: Enhanced Attribution Description: The Enhanced Attribution program is developing technologies to associate malicious cyber actions with individual adversary operators, and to publicly reveal these actions without compromising sources and methods. The program focuses on new approaches for identifying malicious cyber operators, analyzing their software tools and actions, and confirming this information with commercial and public sources of data. As the attribution techniques are developed and show promise, they will provide the basis for new cyber capabilities such as indications and warning of adversary cyber actions. These technologies will be implemented in tools for evaluation by potential transition partners.

FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 decrease reflects program completion. Title: Dispersed Computing Description: The Dispersed Computing program is developing techniques to distribute computing tasks across network computing elements to enable more efficient utilization of enterprise and Internet-based storage, processing, and networking resources. At present, enterprises and Internet-based information technology service providers are increasingly adopting the cloud model, with data storage and computer processing concentrated in large data centers. This brings economies of scale and cost savings to storage and processing, but creates problems for the network and for latency-sensitive applications due to the need to backhaul data to (often distant) data centers for processing. The Dispersed Computing program is developing a dispersed computing architecture that results in more efficient utilization of storage, processing, and networking resources. A key enabler is the recent introduction by vendors of network elements that can be dual-purposed as computational elements. These dual- purpose network-compute elements make it possible to eliminate bottlenecks/chokepoints and to mitigate impossible backhaul requirements by opportunistically moving code to data, given network conditions and available network-compute elements. With Dispersed Computing technology, the network becomes the cloud, and computation is performed where it is most efficient to do so. FY 2022 Plans: - Harden and transition integrated network-compute capabilities to government and commercial network providers.

RADICS technologies enable skilled cyber and power engineers to rapidly restore electrical service after an attack that challenges the recovery capabilities of the impacted organizations (e.g., utilities, balancing authorities, independent system operators, bulk power markets). The potential for a cyber-enabled attack on the U.S. power grid is a national security issue, as the ability of the military to deploy and project force is dependent on the effective and efficient functioning of civilian logistics and supply systems. The program developed technologies to monitor heterogeneous distributed networks, detect anomalies that require rapid assessment, isolate compromised system elements, establish secure emergency communications networks, characterize attacks, and detect3.794 - - Volume 1 - 77 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 22 of 34 R-1 Line #17Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2021 FY 2022 sensor spoofing.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Symbiosis project develops technologies to enable machines to function not only as tools that facilitate human action but also as trustworthy partners to human operators. Of particular interest are systems that can understand human language and extract information and reliably categorize content contained in diverse media; answer questions, reach conclusions, and propose explanations; and learn, reason, and apply knowledge gained through experience to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events. Enabling computing systems with such human-like intelligence is now of critical importance because the tempo of military operations in emerging domains exceeds that at which unaided humans can orient, understand, and act. The technologies developed in the Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Symbiosis project will enable warfighters to make better decisions in complex, time-critical, battlefield environments; intelligence analysts to make sense of massive, incomplete, and contradictory information; software developers and certifiers to design, implement, evaluate, and accredit cyber-physical systems and other complex software-reliant systems with greater efficiency and confidence; and unmanned systems and semi-autonomous agents to perform critical missions in contested physical and virtual environments safely and reliably. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2021 Title: Description: The Accelerating Artificial Intelligence (AAI) program seeks to go beyond commercially-driven advances in AI and to address important national security challenge applications. In particular, this program is focused on improving human-AI collaborations to mitigate current bottlenecks in DoD's ability to rapidly adapt and deploy new technologies and capabilities. If successful, research efforts under this program will significantly accelerate the pace of innovation in many important DoD domains while also reducing the time and cost associated with approval and certification processes needed to transition and deploy new technologies. One technical challenge to be addressed in this program is the need to assess current developmental, approval, and certification processes and identify tasks or sub-tasks amenable to greater automation with minimal human intervention. Other challenges include the need to develop social context aware AI systems and to ensure robustness of AI systems, particularly in novel and/or unanticipated situations. Approaches to addressing these challenges will leverage recent advances at the frontiers of AI research in transfer learning, causal reasoning and associated models. AAI application areas include the following: (1) machine-enabled techniques to efficiently capture, generate, and analyze disparate data sources to accelerate design and development of new materials and chemistries for DoD specific applications; and (2) knowledge management tools that can efficiently capture and disseminate an organization's expertise, experience and data; and (3) social context informed AI approaches to enable reliable and robust forecasting and decision aiding tools for stabilization, deterrence and gray zone operations.39.000 35.100 32.000 Volume 1 - 79 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 24 of 34 R-1 Line #17Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / INTELLIGENCE FY evaluation of novelty generators and novelty-robust AI techniques in military application domains to include new rules, goals, and events. - Demonstrate effectiveness in military applications of novelty-robust AI techniques. - Initiate transition of molecular design systems from academia and industry to DoD partners to evaluate performance in DoD applications. - Define and validate parameters for inverse design of molecules with relevance to DoD applications. - Initiate research in methods to improve human operators' ability to partner with their AI-enabled platforms in off-nominal scenarios. - Start modeling the situational awareness demands imposed by yet-to-be-built autonomous systems. - Initiate development of design tools to enable full-system human machine interface compositions. - Begin development of rapidly reconfigurable human machine interface test environments for highly automated and AI-enabled platforms. - Quantify competency-aware capabilities with relevance to DoD applications, and identify DoD experimental platforms and partners to demonstrate competency-aware capabilities. - Initiate efforts to develop a new understanding of how preconscious signals can be used to measure what people believe to be true. - Demonstrate emulated 250-milliwatt megapixel for a full format sensor with programmable in-pixel circuitry to instantiate front- end AI algorithms with outputs to back end AI processing using realistic device parameters. - Construct proof-of-concept demonstration and measure reduction in learning time increased and effectiveness of learning. - Develop means to understand concepts through grounding them in real world experiences as represented in image and video, and for automatically acquiring novel concepts representing objects and events. - Develop formal models of the structure of uncertainty in financial data sets, together with an ensemble of metrics for inconsistency among multiple data sets. - Develop techniques for identifying the specific processor likely to execute particular code segments based on control blocks identified in schematics. - Explore the use of AI and machine learning (ML) to support, and if possible automate, the generation, maintenance, and repair of proofs used in the formal verification of software. - Initiate Legal, Moral, and Ethical (LME) planning activities and develop an understanding of how escalation of force can and should be appropriately applied in the context of supervised autonomous systems. - Continue efforts to accelerate Artificial Intelligence with a focus on third wave AI.

FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 decrease reflects a shift from development and prototyping to testing. Title: Symbiotic Design Description: The Symbiotic Design program is developing artificial intelligence-based approaches to augment human teams in the design of cyber-physical systems (CPS), and thereby significantly reduce time to deployment and improve the quality of deployed systems. The current generation of DoD systems and platforms integrate cyber and physical subsystems, but the capability of the engineering teams has not scaled with the enormous complexity of modern CPS. Engineering organizations require large teams of engineers that collectively possess the necessary domain knowledge (of component technologies, theories, and tools), but the prolonged timelines of the development process for modern CPS hinders DoD's ability to counter emerging threats. The Symbiotic Design program will address this challenge by transforming the human-focused, model-based design flows used today into a symbiotic process of collaborative analysis by humans and continuously-learning artificial intelligence (AI)-based co-designers. The program will create technologies essential for AI co-design: design space construction, design composition, and design space exploration. The program will demonstrate the approach at realistic scales by a sequence of CPS design challenges of increasing complexity, and quantify the results with respect to development time, system performance, quality, and innovation metrics.

Title: Knowledge-directed Artificial Intelligence Reasoning Over Schemas (KAIROS) Description: The Knowledge-directed Artificial Intelligence (AI) Reasoning Over Schemas (KAIROS) program is developing AI and machine learning technologies to aid a human operator in understanding complex sequences of events in the world. For the purposes of KAIROS, an event is an occurrence that results in an observable and recognizable change in either the physical world or human activity. Events of particular interest to KAIROS are those that create changes that have significant impact on national or homeland security. The KAIROS program will develop automated systems that codify existing event-representation schemas and, when needed, create and codify new schemas to bring structure to complex event sequences and present these structured representations to operators. Given multi-media inputs, operators will use KAIROS technologies to identify subsidiary event elements, determine their temporal order, recognize complex event sequences, and link disparate events. KAIROS technologies aim to enable analysts and warfighters to understand unfolding events rapidly and accurately. FY 2022 Plans: - Develop capability for machine learning of the similarities and differences in the structural features of various complex event schemas. - Develop the means to curate the schema library and methods for identifying intermediate levels in the structure of the library. - Develop a user interface to probe input sources for missing information and to provide interactive feedback.13.000 22.000 27.334 Volume 1 - 82 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 27 of 34 R-1 Line #17Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / INTELLIGENCE in Millions) FY 2021 FY 2022 FY 2023 - Collaborate with transition partners to evaluate systems on complex real-world event sequences and identify necessary adjustments. FY 2023 Plans: - Develop means to interpolate events of interest not reported in multiple sources that occur within complex sequences of events. - Develop means to predict future events from a sequence of complex events that is presently unfolding. - Evaluate the detection and prediction capabilities with DoD and IC users on problems related to stabilization in regional conflicts. - Optimize the system in response to operational partner assessments on complex real-world event sequences and transition the technology. FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 increase reflects continued development of techniques for learning complex event schemas and event discovery and prediction, and increased work to assess techniques on operational DoD and IC data. Title: Automated Rapid Certification Of Software (ARCOS) Description: The Automated Rapid Certification Of Software (ARCOS) program is developing technologies that automate the capture and evaluation of software assurance evidence to enable certifiers to assess system risks earlier in the process and to commit to engineering decisions more rapidly and safely. Current software certification practices do not scale with the extent, complexity, and interconnection of software being developed by the DoD, so certification is becoming a bottleneck to new system deployment. ARCOS technologies address DoD software system certification time and cost. ARCOS technology will automatically and interactively generate strong assurance arguments that incorporate supporting evidence for certification criteria. ARCOS will also develop techniques to compose assurance arguments for pre-evaluated components into consolidated assurance arguments for new systems incorporating those components. FY 2022 Plans: - Develop approaches to augment assurance evidence for legacy software to provide stronger fitness arguments. - Demonstrate automatically calculated confidence measures for assurance case arguments that are objectively meaningful. - Demonstrate the composability of automatically generated assurance case arguments to support incremental evaluations. - Reduce the computation time necessary to automatically generate assurance case arguments for complex military systems.

FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 repricing. Learning Introspective Control (LINC)* Description: *Formerly Control System Introspection The Learning Introspective Control (LINC) program will develop machine introspection and learning technologies to characterize a modified or damaged military platform from its behavior, and update the control law to maintain stability and control. The current approach to handling platform modification or damage places the burden of recovery and control on the operator, whether the operator is human or an autonomous controller. In contrast, a platform equipped with LINC technology will continually compare the real-time behavior of the platform as measured by on-board sensors with a learned model, determine if the current observed behavior of the platform differs from that model in ways that might compromise stability and control, and implement an updated control law when required. The LINC capability would aid operators in maintaining effective control of military platforms that suffer damage in battle or have been modified in the field to address emergent requirements identified during operations. FY 2022 Plans: - Develop machine introspection and learning approaches for estimating the transfer function and related control-theoretic models in real time using data from the multiple sensors organic to the platform. - Develop machine-learning based algorithms to enable the automated adaptation of a physical model representative of a system to enable it to reconstitute effective control after battle damage or in-the-field modification. - Collaborate with Service transition partners to identify high-priority military cyber-physical systems and use cases for initial experimentation. FY 2023 Plans: - Design and implement a testbed for assessing integrated machine introspection and learning approaches for operator-assisted recovery and control of military platforms that suffer damage in battle or are modified in the field. - Improve the computational efficiency of control reconstitution algorithms and expand their applicability to more complex DoD systems. - Develop a computational platform to support experiments involving cyber-physical systems and high-priority use cases in collaboration with Service transition partners.

Title: Counter Adversarial Artificial Intelligence Description: The Counter Adversarial Artificial Intelligence program aims to enhance the capability to detect, deflect, and diminish the effects of adversarial attacks on AI-based systems. Defense systems increasingly incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities such as machine learning and automated reasoning. These AI-enabled systems are typically engineered and optimized for environments where adversary systems are either static or strictly limited in terms of adaptive behaviors. Engagements between sophisticated AI-enabled systems are likely to become increasingly common going forward. Maintaining AI-superiority for the U.S. will require systems with higher levels of capability. Specific capabilities to be developed include recognizing when an adversary system is AI-enabled, identifying and modeling adversary AI capabilities based on empirical data, and creating counter-AI strategies including techniques to render adversary AI capabilities ineffective and/or deleterious. FY 2022 Plans: - Model the range of potential adversarial AI behaviors, including the nature of vulnerabilities in machine learning (ML) components and symbolic AI components. - Conceptualize AI systems with capabilities to detect, deflect, and diminish the effects of adversarial attacks. - Formulate approaches for recognizing when an adversary system is AI-enabled, identify and model adversary AI capabilities based on empirical data, and counter adversary AI strategies. FY 2023 Plans: - Develop and demonstrate the capability to model and learn adversarial AI behaviors and formulate approaches for using this capability to detect, deflect, and diminish the effects of adversarial attacks. - Develop techniques for establishing dimensionality reduction properties for AI-enabled systems and use these properties to constrain the extent of analysis including the number of test cases. - Develop cross-validation-based approaches for mitigating the vulnerabilities in ML-based and symbolic AI components and demonstrate the capability to render adversarial AI attacks ineffective for high-priority military use cases. FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 increase reflects ramping up of development of counter adversarial AI techniques and initial demonstrations of techniques on high-priority military use cases.- 14.500 22.000 Title: Assured Autonomy Description: The Assured Autonomy program is developing rigorous design and analysis technologies for continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems to enhance system safety in uncertain environments.

As a result, autonomous systems enabled by machine learning (e.g., deep neural nets for perception, reinforcement learning for control policies, and online model learning) lack rigorous safety assurance. Assured Autonomy is developing new techniques for modeling and system design, formal verification, simulation-based testing, and safety-assured learning to provide continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems. The technologies being developed in Assured Autonomy will enable the DoD to more rapidly and efficiently deploy learning-enabled autonomous systems that can be trusted to operate safely in uncertain environments. FY 2022 Plans: - Evaluate the impact of safety-constraints incorporated in online learning algorithms on the performance of autonomous systems operating in unknown and unstructured environments. - Develop and implement improvements to formal verification tools and monitoring techniques. - Demonstrate technologies on assurance challenge problems for several learning-enabled autonomous platforms of interest to the DoD. FY 2023 Plans: - Develop integrated toolchains for end-to-end development and assurance of learning-enabled systems. - Demonstrate integrated tools on multiple autonomous systems of interest to DoD. FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 decrease reflects the shift from development of techniques and tools to demonstrations on several learning-enabled autonomous platforms. Title: Active Interpretation of Disparate Alternatives (AIDA) Description: The Active Interpretation of Disparate Alternatives (AIDA) program is developing a multi-hypothesis semantic engine that generates alternative interpretations of events, situations, and trends from a variety of unstructured sources where there are noisy, conflicting, and potentially deceptive data. At present, information from each medium is often analyzed independently, without the context provided by information from other media, with only informal comparison among competing hypotheses. The consequence of this can be inadequate interpretations, because alternatives are eliminated due to lack of evidence even in the absence of contradictory evidence. AIDA seeks to develop and demonstrate technology to automatically map information derived from diverse media into a common semantic representation, aggregate information, resolve ambiguities, discover conflicting information, and generate and explore multiple interpretations of events, situations, and trends. AIDA aims to provide decision makers a capability to understand alternative explanations for available information and to make contingency plans accordingly.

FY 2023 Plans: - Enhance the techniques for detecting important changes in otherwise similar documents to achieve a level of precision and recall necessary to enable discovery and analysis of different hypotheses. - Collaborate with transition partners to establish the utility of the technology and tailor the platform for transition partner applications. FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 decrease reflects the shift from development of techniques for generating multiple alternative interpretations from multimedia data to evaluations of techniques on real-world data and optimization of the platform for transition partner applications. Title: Automating Scientific Knowledge Extraction and Modeling (ASKEM) Description: The Automating Scientific Knowledge Extraction and Modeling (ASKEM) program will develop technologies and tools for the agile creation, sustainment, and enhancement of complex models and simulators to enable knowledge extraction and data-informed decision making in diverse scientific domains and military missions. Current modeling and simulation pipelines do not maintain the relevant inputs, assumptions, and modeling choices made during development, while rapidly changing knowledge, semantically-opaque models, and black-box simulators make pipelined development nearly impossible. ASKEM will enable a new paradigm for scientific modeling analogous to the transition in software development from the lengthy waterfall model to agile, continuous DevOps. ASKEM will produce modeling automation tools that 1) extract model components from documents and code while abstracting away from implementation details like math framework, language, and platform; 2) compose distinct model and simulator components; and 3) integrate all elements and processes in an extensible workbench that addresses the entire modeling and simulation lifecycle. ASKEM tools will enable experts to maintain, reuse, and adapt large collections of heterogeneous data, knowledge and models with traceability across knowledge sources, model assumptions, and model fitness and thereby bring agile, pipelined development to modeling and simulation. ASKEM technologies will be applied to multiple use cases to drive scalability and generality. FY 2023 Plans: - Develop formal representations and techniques for machine-assisted modeling that support automated composition and decomposition for model creation, sustainment, and customization.- - 16.200 Volume 1 - 87 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 32 of 34 R-1 Line #17Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / INTELLIGENCE in Millions) FY 2022 FY 2023 - Develop tools for machine-assisted simulator design and construction, enabling the rapid composition of models, frameworks, and solvers that are problem appropriate. - Develop tools for continuous machine-assisted validation of models, including construction of fitness-for-purpose simulators to accompany prognostic measures. - Initiate development of an extensible workbench that spans the entire modeling and simulation lifecycle in which the technologies can be evaluated against diverse use cases in collaboration with transition sponsors. FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 increase reflects program initiation. Title: Artificial Intelligence Reliability and Traceability (AIRT) Description: The Artificial Intelligence Reliability and Traceability (AIRT) program will develop design-time and run-time technologies to ensure the correct functioning of AI-enabled systems. As AI deployment scales up, it becomes more important for machine learning (ML) systems and their training data to be explainable, which means providing rationale for classifications, characterizing confidence level of the classifications, and, as a consequence, conveying an understanding of how the system will behave with similar inputs. Explainability, however, is not sufficient to ensure that ML systems meet reliability requirements and are free of bias, in the sense that the ML operates consistently with domain-focused predictive models, nor that they are traceable, in the sense that there are mappings between the models and the ML behaviors. AIRT will develop the test, evaluation, verification, and validation (TEVV) technologies that system developers need to ensure that AI-enabled systems will correctly perform their intended functions. The AIRT TEVV technologies will address the challenge of how to specify AI-related behaviors and then how to verify the specified behaviors using both analytic formal approaches, which emphasize mathematical modeling and reasoning, and traditional statistical-sampling based approaches. AIRT will also develop design principles for machine learning and related systems that enhance reliability and traceability without appreciable compromise to reasoning capability. Additionally, AIRT will develop traceability approaches that model the learning behavior of an AI component to enable developers, testers, and operators to gain detailed knowledge of how the AI system reached a computational state. The AIRT program aims to make the design and operation of AI systems more scientific and safe. FY 2022 Plans: - Formulate approaches for TEVV of AI-enabled systems and associated data to increase confidence in correct performance of intended functions. - Explore TEVV approaches that include means to specify intended AI-related behaviors and that combine analytic formal approaches, which emphasize mathematical modeling and reasoning, with traditional statistical-sampling based approaches.- 6.000 - Volume 1 - 88 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 33 of 34 R-1 Line #17Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / INTELLIGENCE in FY 2023 - Introduce traceability approaches akin to check-pointing and other roll-back techniques that can enhance knowledge of how an AI system reached a computational state. FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 decrease reflects program completion. Title: Engineering Artificial Intelligence Systems Implementations (EAISI) Description: The Engineering Artificial Intelligence Systems Implementations (EAISI) program is creating technologies and tools to support the development of viable and trusted systems that include AI and machine learning (ML) capabilities. Modern AI- dependent systems may include multiple AI components, drawing on a diverse set of AI-related techniques, ranging from ML to knowledge representation, search, planning, game theory, and optimization. Current methods for development of such systems remains primarily based on trial-and-error designs, with limited abstractions, architectures, and patterns. These developments can be costly, risky, and demanding of very high levels of expertise. To address this, EAISI will develop abstractions, patterns, architectures, assurance techniques, and iterative processes that facilitate the analysis and synthesis of complex systems that must rely on AI-based components and associated training data. One of the more difficult engineering challenges with AI is evaluation and assurance, since AI-based systems tend to resist traditional approaches to testing, inspection, and analysis. It is not possible to fully test an AI-based system for every situation it will ever encounter, so new techniques are needed for verifying and validating AI-based systems. EAISI aims to create software and systems engineering techniques, tools, and practices to facilitate the development of AI-based systems that are capable, trustworthy, affordable, and timely. FY 2022 Plans: - Formulate rigorous approaches for managing training data for AI-based systems, including provenance, security, and quality, to facilitate the engineering of AI-based systems that are capable, trustworthy, affordable, and timely. - Devise approaches for testing, analyzing, and evaluating AI-based systems as means for gaining confidence in and rigorously validating those systems. - Devise a framework for integrating prototype tools in an AI systems engineering development environment for use by developers and evaluators who are not experts in AI. FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: Intelligence (XAI) Description: The Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) program is developing a new generation of machine learning techniques that are able to explain their rationale, characterize their strengths and weaknesses, and convey an understanding of how they will behave in the future. AI is a critical enabler for U.S. military systems that will perform increasingly complex and sensitive9.165 8.324 - Volume 1 - 89 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 34 of 34 R-1 Line #17Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / INTELLIGENCE in Millions) FY 2021 FY 2022 FY 2023 missions. However, in order for developers, users, and senior leaders to feel confident enough to deploy and use AI-enabled systems, these systems must be able to explain their rationale, and their recommendations, decisions, and actions must be delivered in a way that military users can understand and trust. Today, most machine learning systems provide no explanations, or provide explanations that are at the wrong level of abstraction, not meaningful to a human user, or inconsistent with the full range of behaviors of the AI system. XAI is developing the tools necessary to build explainable AI systems, specifically with: (1) new machine learning techniques that produce human-interpretable models and (2) user interfaces that generate explanations from those models that are meaningful to end-users, using natural language, saliency maps, and other representations. XAI implementations will be developed and demonstrated in next-generation data analytics and autonomous systems. FY 2022 Plans: - Refine machine learning explanation systems for human-machine teaming prototypes in coordination with DoD partners. - Provide toolkit for explainable AI to DoD and IC partners targeting relevant use cases.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Tactical Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because it supports the advancement of concepts and technologies to enhance the next generation of tactical systems. The Tactical Technology Program Element funds a number of projects in the areas of Naval Warfare, Advanced Land Systems, Aeronautics and Space Technology and Information Analytics Technology. The Naval Warfare Technology project develops advanced technologies for application to a broad range of naval requirements. Enabling and novel technologies include concepts for expanding the envelope of operational naval capabilities to include the entire sea column such as improved situational awareness over large maritime environments, ship self-defense techniques, novel underwater propulsion modalities, high speed underwater vessels, improved techniques for underwater object detection and discrimination, long endurance unmanned surface vehicles, methods and techniques for servicing assets throughout the sea column, and high bandwidth communications. This project will also examine methods and architectures for distributing maritime operations to enable a more agile, survivable, and cost-effective fleet. The Advanced Land Systems Technology project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations, including competing in undergoverned spaces. Programs in this project will break the relative symmetry of land combat to give U.S. forces a decided advantage in the current and future ground battlefield. The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that reduce reliance on consolidated forward-operating bases and required lines of communication, and provide small units and individual warfighters with hyper-mobility and hyper-lethality. This project will develop methods and technologies to expand the maneuver trade space to include the vertical dimension, including subterranean environments, as well as undergoverned spaces. It will leverage advances in artificial intelligence to enable integrated manned-unmanned operations and decrease warfighter exposure through the use of autonomous agents. Aeronautics and Space Technology efforts will address high payoff opportunities that dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced aeronautical and space systems and/or provide revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military mission requirements. This includes advanced technology studies of revolutionary propulsion, vehicle, and launch concepts, sophisticated fabrication methods, and examination of novel materials and enabling technologies for Volume 1 - 95 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 2 of 24 R-1 Line #22Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2023 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide / BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0602702E / TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY aeronautics and space system applications. Studies that also fundamentally change the calculus of battle including consideration of a mix of assets, platforms that are potentially disposable or with limited lifespans, and autonomous integration of space and air platforms in the tactical battlespace are included as well. The Information Analytics Technology project develops technology for analyzing data and information arising from: 1) intelligence networks; 2) open sources, social and broadcast media, and other external sources; 3) sensors and signal/image processors; and 4) collection platforms and weapon systems. Technical challenges include processing huge volumes of diverse, incomplete, and uncertain data in tactically-relevant timeframes, and countering the information operations of sophisticated adversaries who seek to deceive, degrade, deny, and disrupt the U.S. information enterprise.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Advanced Land Systems Technology project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations, including competing in undergoverned spaces. Programs in this project will break the relative symmetry of land combat to give U.S. forces a decided advantage in the current and future ground battlefield. The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that reduce reliance on consolidated forward-operating bases and required lines of communication, and provide small units and individual warfighters with hyper-mobility and hyper-lethality. This project will develop methods and technologies to expand the maneuver trade space to include the vertical dimension, including subterranean environments, as well as undergoverned spaces. It will leverage advances in artificial intelligence to enable integrated manned-unmanned operations and decrease warfighter exposure through the use of autonomous agents. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2021 FY 2022 FY 2023 Title: with Resiliency (RACER) Description: Multi-domain operations (MDO) environments present complex and challenging environments to ground combat platforms. Ground combat platforms must operate in a more distributed manner in these environments to gain a sustained tactical advantage and enhance Warfighter survivability. The Army intends to deploy autonomous robotic combat vehicles and optionally manned fighting vehicles to accomplish this objective. In order to meet the demands of an MDO environment, significant advances in perception, planning, and control algorithms are required to autonomously maneuver faster and more resiliently in complex and novel off-road environments. Maneuver environments are characterized by three-dimensional surfaces of highly compliant soils and vegetation, hundreds of positive and negative obstacle classes, no defined road networks or driving rules, and where use of terrain for survivability is critical. In order to achieve operationally relevant speeds and resilience to novel situations on the future battlefield, while simultaneously reducing the Soldier cognitive and communications burden and increasing battle space awareness, Robotic Autonomy in Complex Environments with Resiliency (RACER) will demonstrate game-changing autonomous ground combat vehicle mobility using a combination of simulation and advanced platforms. RACER will deliver autonomy algorithms using the latest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine-learning techniques, a code repository, an off-road simulation environment tailored for military off-road autonomy development, tactical route planning methods and field- demonstrated off-road autonomous capabilities. The culmination of the RACER program will be to demonstrate fully autonomous maneuver on a military Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) in a variety of militarily relevant environments.

Title: Competing in Undergoverned Spaces Description: A vast majority of U.S. technology is focused on gaining competitive advantage against near peer adversaries in kinetic engagements where there are known rules and players, concrete timelines and clear winners and losers. While these finite games are important, many critical engagements are closer to infinite contests--dynamic, diffuse high dimensionality interactions that play out over long periods with an ultimate goal of resetting the regional power and influence equilibrium. Competing in these contests is critical for successful stabilization and Humanitarian Assistance Disaster Relief (HADR) missions, as well as operations in undergoverned spaces. Some undergoverned spaces are geographic, where local governance is sufficiently weak such that internal or external parties can compete for influence over the local population. Some contested undergoverned spaces are more conceptual yet still very real, defined by virtual or physical domains that lack or regularly violate ethical, legal, social and institutional order such as supply chains or the cyber-domain. The Competing in Undergoverned Spaces will develop technologies that are focused on successfully competing in infinite contests by developing tools for situational awareness and interpretation of signals, constant acting, assessing and adapting (i.e., iterative Hypothesis A/B testing) and new ways of viewing experimentation from a foundation of asynchronous observations and actions. Specific areas of interest include information, influence or economic tools that rapidly adapt to the environment to yield specific effects that can be sensed. This includes developing new options to engage friendly/non-friendly local populations while minimizing the social impact of stabilization. Other areas of interest include sensing tools designed to update pre-existing models to support decision making, and decision tools designed to adapt to changing population or adversary actions.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Information Analytics Technology project develops technology for analyzing data and information arising from: 1) intelligence networks; 2) open sources, social and broadcast media, and other external sources; 3) sensors and signal/image processors; and 4) collection platforms and weapon systems. Technical challenges include processing huge volumes of diverse, incomplete, and uncertain data in tactically-relevant timeframes, and countering the information operations of sophisticated adversaries who seek to deceive, degrade, deny, and disrupt the U.S. information enterprise. Benefits sought include a deeper understanding of the evolving operational environment tailored to the needs of commanders at every echelon; an enhanced capability to plan, monitor, and control diverse military operations ranging from stabilization and information operations to combat engagements; and increased efficiency of core military functions such as national and homeland security, warfighter health and readiness, and defense support of law enforcement and civil authorities. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) Forensics (SemaFor) program is developing technologies to defend against the falsification of multimedia and disinformation campaigns. Statistical detection techniques have been successful, but media generation and manipulation technologies applicable to imagery, voice, video, text, and other modalities are advancing rapidly. Purely statistical detection methods are now insufficient to detect these manipulations, especially when multiple modalities are involved. Existing media generation and manipulation algorithms are data driven and are prone to making semantic errors that provide defenders an opportunity for asymmetric advantage. SemaFor is developing semantic and statistical analysis algorithms that determine if media is generated or manipulated, attribution algorithms that infer if media originates from a particular organization or individual, and characterization algorithms that reason about whether media was falsified (generated or manipulated) for malicious purposes. SemaFor aims to create technologies to identify, deter, and understand adversary media falsification. FY 2022 Plans: - Implement algorithmic approaches for analyzing and reasoning about inconsistencies across multiple media instances, detecting falsification, and explaining the reasoning for detections. - Develop machine learning and other artificial intelligence techniques to attribute falsified media to particular adversarial elements and to characterize the intent of falsified media as benign or malicious. - Extend evaluations to social media and news feeds requiring multimodal reasoning and incorporate datasets informed by DoD and IC transition partners into challenge problems and evaluations.19.700 21.921 29.839 Volume 1 - 111 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 18 of 24 R-1 Line #22Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 (Number/Name) TT-13 / INFORMATION in Millions) FY 2021 FY 2022 FY 2023 - Collaborate with DoD and IC partners to assess adversarial threat scenarios and to identify areas for additional research effort.

Title: Influence Campaign Awareness and Sensemaking (INCAS) Description: The Influence Campaign Awareness and Sensemaking (INCAS) program is developing analyst-guided techniques, tools, and platforms for the DoD to detect and understand geopolitical influence campaigns in a rigorous, quantitative manner. Increasingly, competitors and adversaries are using influence operations to project soft power. Competitor and adversary influence campaigns can be overt in the form of anti-U.S. messaging, or they can be disguised in the form of complex narratives that seek to advance agendas harmful to U.S. interests. The U.S. Government and DoD need the capability to rapidly detect and understand competitor and adversary messaging campaigns and narratives within the context of the populations and groups for whom they are intended. To accomplish this, the program will develop and operationalize natural language processing, social network analysis, psychographics, and behavioral science-based technologies, and integrate these into a unified influence campaign modeling framework and sensemaking platform. INCAS aims to produce a suite of automated digital tools to enable analysts to better understand how information is being used by competitors and adversaries, and to quantitatively assess in real time and at scale the effects of influence campaigns across time and over multiple platforms. FY 2022 Plans: - Develop tools for extraction of influence indicators and demographic and psychographic target population attributes from social and other media messaging at scale. - Develop tools for dynamically segmenting target population based on response, incorporating parameters such as volume and emotion. - Develop testbed infrastructure and data provisioning ingest pipeline components for performance evaluations.6.000 13.500 23.000 Volume 1 - 112 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 19 of 24 R-1 Line #22Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 (Number/Name) TT-13 / INFORMATION in Millions) FY 2021 FY 2022 FY 2023 - Develop user interfaces for campaign modeling and conduct usability assessment in collaboration with military subject matter experts.

Title: Adapting Cross-domain Kill-Webs (ACK) Description: The Adapting Cross-domain Kill-Webs (ACK) program is assisting military decision makers with rapidly identifying and selecting options for tasking and re-tasking assets within and across organizational boundaries. Based on technologies developed in the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contest Environment (RSPACE) program (previously budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), ACK will assist users with selecting sensors, effectors, and support elements across military domains (space, air, land, surface, subsurface, and cyber) to form and adapt kill chains to deliver desired effects on targets. Today's Command and Control (C2) organizations and processes cannot support multi-domain warfighting concepts, especially during joint operations. ACK will address this challenge by utilizing a decentralized approach to allocating resources to tasks and assigning mission orders to assets, motivated by ideas developed in online commerce, sourcing, and supply chain management, such as bid requests and offers. The impact of ACK will be to accelerate asset re-allocation and assignment decision timelines to be on the order of minutes, and the output of ACK will be automated tools and decision aids to support the selection of the elements of a kill-chain and assignment of roles and responsibilities to each of the elements.

Approaches for addressing these limitations under the Multi-Scale Modeling thrust include the following: (1) development of observation driven/first-principles theory of magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling; (2) creation of an extensible assimilation framework for unifying space environment monitoring systems and data; and (3) non-traditional space environment measurement approaches. These developments will ensure the accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution of space weather models and is sufficient to enable prediction of operationally relevant perturbations and disturbances in the space environment. FY 2022 Plans: - Demonstrate and field test an integrated space environment forecasting capability to predict perturbation and disturbances within scale lengths as small as one hundred kilometers, every hour, within a seventy-two-hour window, and over an area representative of an operation area of responsibility.

Title: Restoring Cognitive Capability Description: The Restoring Cognitive Capability program is developing novel drugs to provide rapid therapy for neuropsychiatric disorders experienced by warfighters and veterans. Active duty military personnel face increased risk of acute and chronic neuropsychiatric dysfunction, limiting day-to-day function and return to duty. Current therapeutic approaches for many neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Post Traumatic Stress Disorder [PTSD], mood disorders, and substance abuse) rely on individual management with integrated psychiatric therapy and medication. However, most interventions approved for use in these conditions lack long-term efficacy, involve a logistical burden of treatment and/or carry a risk of serious adverse side effects. Novel drugs developed under this program will be designed to functionally interact with neuronal receptor subtypes known to play a role in these neuropsychiatric conditions, with the aim of enabling fast-acting and effective alleviation of neuropsychiatric dysfunction with single or minimal doses.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Electronics Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its objective is to develop electronics that make a wide range of military applications possible. The Electronics Technology Project focuses on turning basic advancements into the underpinning technologies required to address critical national security issues and to enable an information-driven warfighter. This Program Element also supports innovation and robust transition planning in the technology cycle by working with entrepreneurs to increase the likelihood that DARPA funded technologies take root in the U.S. and provide new capabilities for national defense. Advances in microelectronic device technologies continue to significantly benefit improved weapons effectiveness, intelligence capabilities, and information superiority. The Electronic Technology project supports continued advancement in microelectronics, including electronic and optoelectronic devices, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), semiconductor device design and fabrication, and new materials and material structures. Areas of particular emphasis of this work include reducing the barriers to designing and fabricating custom electronics and exploiting improved manufacturing techniques to provide low-cost, high-performance sensors. Programs in this project will also greatly improve the size, weight, power, and performance characteristics of electronic systems; support positioning, navigation, and timing in GPS-denied environments; and develop sensors more sensitive and robust than today's standards. This project has six major focus areas: Electronics, Photonics, Microelectromechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research. The Beyond Scaling Technology project recognizes that, within the next decade, the continuous pace of improvements in electronics performance will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology. This project pursues electronics performance advancements that exploit new concepts in circuit specialization by the optimization of materials, devices, architectures, and designs to achieve specific circuit function at high performance.

Programs also explore alternatives to traditional circuit architectures, for instance by exploiting vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices and by incorporating novel materials and new techniques for securing DoD and commercial data and hardware.

Title: Wideband Adaptive RF Protection (WARP) Description: The Wideband Adaptive RF Protection (WARP) program is developing radio frequency (RF) front-end technology that can protect wideband digital radios against external electromagnetic threats and self-interference through tunable filtering, limiting, and/or signal cancellation. The ability to create tunable and reconfigurable band pass and band stop filters in the range of 2 gigahertz (GHz) to 8 GHz will be important for implementing transmit/receive modules in next-generation multi-function arrays. Another important area of interference mitigation is self-interference. WARP is developing the signal cancellation technology that will listen to the transmitted interfering signal and subtract it from the input of the receiver so faint signals near the noise floor can still be detected. Program research will provide feedback mechanisms that intelligently correct these problems. Whether for self- induced interference or external interference jamming, WARP is developing intelligent filtering and self-interference cancellation technologies to protect wideband DoD receivers. FY 2022 Plans: - Demonstrate a center frequency and bandwidth tuning range of band pass and band stop filters that aligns with the need to protect wideband digital receivers. - Demonstrate analog signal cancellers that mitigate transmitter self-leakage into a wideband receiver and while achieving relevant bandwidth and delay spread. - Evaluate scalability of candidate approaches for wideband adaptive filtering and signal cancellation architectures to achieve desired RF protection.

Title: Fast Event-based Neuromorphic Camera and Electronics (FENCE) Description: The Fast Event-based Neuromorphic Camera and Electronics (FENCE) program will develop and demonstrate a low latency, low power event-based infrared (IR) camera to enable intelligent sensors for tactical DoD applications. Event-based imagers are an emerging class of sensors with major demonstrated advantages relative to traditional cameras. State-of-the-art visible event-based cameras have been shown to produce over two orders of magnitude less data in optimal conditions relative to traditional framing cameras because they transmit data only from pixels that have changed. This leads directly to two orders of magnitude lower data latency and a commensurate reduction in power consumption. Despite their inherent advantages, existing event-based cameras are not compatible with DoD applications because DoD applications regularly face conditions that are not naturally sparse, where issues such as clutter and noise would cause a large percentage of the event-based pixels to change simultaneously. When this happens, today's event-based cameras do not perform significantly better than traditional cameras. FENCE will develop an infrared event-based imager consistent with military requirements. FENCE will develop a four-megapixel asynchronous read-out integrated circuit (ROIC), co-designed with a 3D integrated processor that will intelligently remove noise and clutter to maintain low power and latency operation even when faced with all of the pixels firing simultaneously. If successful, this new class of sensors enabled by FENCE will be capable of responding to fast moving targets and discriminating dim targets in noisy conditions.

Title: Quantum Apertures (QA) Description: The Quantum Apertures (QA) program will develop novel radio receiver and aperture systems using quantum sensors as the receiving elements. These receiver systems will be portable, programmable over a very large frequency range, and more sensitive than classical systems at similar size and temperature. This will be achieved by exploiting quantum-based receiving elements composed of atomic vapor cells in highly-excited \"Rydberg\" states that have programmable sensitivity over a large range of frequencies and amplitudes. The program will require quantum engineering and traditional electro-mechanical systems engineering to overcome technical and application challenges that impede rapid adoption of a quantum aperture receiver by the defense industrial base. The receiver system's enhanced capabilities will be leveraged in this program to develop novel waveforms while also being compatible with constraints imposed by real-world defense applications. The final receiver system will comprise a phase-sensitive array of quantum receiving elements, lasers to program the sensor and read out radio signals, and processing electronics.

Title: Waveform Agile Radio-frequency Directed Energy (WARDEN) Description: The Waveform Agile Radio-frequency Directed Energy (WARDEN) program aims to extend the range and lethality of high-power microwave (HPM) systems by introducing flexible waveform techniques that use combinations of frequency, amplitude, and pulse-width modulations to significantly improve electromagnetic coupling into complex target enclosures and increase the probability of disruption or damage to internal electronic components and circuits. Applications for HPM systems include counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS), vehicle and vessel disruption, electronic strike, and guided missile defense. Current HPM systems use oscillators to produce electromagnetic radiation. These systems are inherently narrowband and lack the frequency agility to support waveforms to maximize electromagnetic coupling and to optimally exploit electronic system vulnerabilities. Lacking the capability to use optimized waveforms, HPM oscillators have been pushed close to the physical limits of peak power generation. To develop a more efficient, lower power, waveform agile approach, the WARDEN program will develop and demonstrate the first broadband HPM amplifier; create new theory and simulation tools to predict electromagnetic coupling into complex enclosures and the effects on electronics; and develop novel agile waveform techniques capable of reducing the susceptibility threshold of targeted electronics systems to HPM attack.

Title: Generating RF with Photonics for low Noise (GRYPHON) Description: The Generating RF with Photonics for low Noise (GRYPHON) program will develop compact sources of microwaves and millimeter waves with extremely low phase noise. Compact signal sources used today, such as crystal oscillators, are too noisy to support advanced military radar and communications functions. Conversely, best-in-class oscillators which use optical techniques to synthesize extremely pure microwaves are too large and expensive to deploy on the airborne systems, munitions, and other size-constrained platforms where the DoD requires high-performance capabilities.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Space Programs and Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced space systems and provides revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military missions. A space force structure that is robust against attack represents a stabilizing deterrent against adversary attacks on space assets. This program element will examine concepts and architectures that move the U.S. away from a dependence on monolithic, ultra-capable, vulnerable, and unsustainably costly assets; replacing them with disaggregated assets that are agile, affordable, and easily replaced. Ready access to space requires the delivery of capabilities, replenishment of supplies into orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities. In addition, developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space. Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity and functionality of space systems, space-derived information, and services with terrestrial users. Studies under this program element include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness, and precision control of multi-payload systems. Studies will actively seek to take advantage of new commercial developments which may enable both rapid constitution/reconstitution of assets, and agility/functionality not previously available for military systems.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Mixed Technology Integration project funds the advanced development and demonstration of selected basic and applied electronics research programs. Examples of technologies with funded development and demonstration activities include, but are not limited to: reducing the size, weight, and power (SWaP) of components for laser weapon systems that will protect airborne platforms from emerging surface-to-air missiles; integrated photonic-electronic components for positioning, navigation and timing in GPS-denied environments; flexible, software-defined cameras that enable real-time image analysis of complex scenes to provide more actionable information; and optical communications systems that rely on no moving parts enabling their use on SWaP-restricted platforms. Funding under this project is intended to advance transitioning novel technologies to use, providing advanced components compatible with mid-term and other future warfighting requirements. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ (WiSPER) Description: The Wideband Secured and Protected Emitter and Receiver (WiSPER) program aims to develop an ultra- broadband technology platform to demonstrate a robust, secure, and protected communication link. WiSPER technology provides high signal coding gain to deliver a secured and protected link with significantly enhanced capacity for next generation DoD communications. Current terrestrial tactical radios operate with limited bandwidth at prescribed low frequency bands, which are unable to support high capacity with multiple users and are vulnerable to interference and jamming. WiSPER technology addresses military needs for assured communications, throughput, security, and size, weight, and power limitations of future command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The program will develop an ultra-broadband compact antenna, radio frequency front-end electronics, mixed-signal circuits, and waveform technologies. The WiSPER program will culminate with the integration and demonstration of a secured communication link. Technologies developed under the WiSPER program are planned for transition to the Services. FY 2022 Plans: - Optimize the secured radio transceiver design using modeling and simulation. - Integrate first-generation functional test prototype of the secured radio transceiver. - Test bench-top prototype secured radio transceiver in a laboratory environment, demonstrating spatial coding and first- generation featureless packet generation, transmission, and reception.

Title: Reconfigurable Imaging (ReImagine) Description: The Reconfigurable Imaging (ReImagine) program aims to create multi-functional readout integrated circuits (ROICs) that fundamentally change the way camera systems collect, process, and relay image information. This is accomplished by adding multifunctional flexibility in the ROIC. Today, most cameras are designed to capture high quality imagery at standard frame rates. These traditional camera architectures collect a single type of data across the full image frame. Specialty cameras can be used to capture different spatial, spectral, or temporal data but are rarely deployed because of the cost and complexity of adding imaging subsystems for niche measurements. Although these measurements typically are desired only for specific features or regions of interest (ROIs) in a scene, the cameras collect specialized data over the full image frame. The ReImagine architecture, conversely, would enable a single, real-time reconfigurable, software-defined camera system with the ability to collect different data in different ROIs. Depending on the need, a ReImagine imager would be able to selectively collect and simultaneously process data from a specific ROI, for example, at a higher resolution, at a higher frame rate, or with 3-D depth information. The system would interface with virtually any sensor and could therefore be used in any spectral band. By demonstrating more efficient data collection and computation across ROIs, ReImagine ROICs will enable real-time analysis of much more complex scenes and provide more actionable information than has ever been possible. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Air Force, Navy, and Army. FY 2022 Plans: - Fully demonstrate the updated ReImagine reconfigurable sensing system concept. - Engage with potential transition partners for relevant applications.

This makes current LWS difficult and costly to manufacture, limiting their deployment and application. MELT will leverage recent advances in coherent beam combining and photonic integrated circuits (PICs) fabrication techniques to develop tiled arrays integrated with semiconductor-based optical systems, low-loss waveguides, optical interconnects, and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) into a compact laser tile that can be integrated with a supporting backplane to provide scalable HEL sources. This will provide the LWS developer a scalable HEL architecture that maintains excellent beam quality and allow LWS deployment on SWaP-constrained platforms. MELT will leverage a mature industrial base for semiconductor manufacturing, as well as recent advances in photonic integrated circuits, coherent beam combining algorithms, semiconductor cooling techniques, and optical lithography to achieve its program goals. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to Army, Air Force, and Navy. FY 2023 Plans: - Design semiconductor emitters with improved electrical-to-optical efficiency. - Demonstrate efficient beam combining with individual semiconductor emitters. - Develop algorithm and sensing architecture to control beam coherence.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2021 FY 2022 FY 2023 Title: Programmable Logic for Applications In Defense (PLAID) Description: The Programmable Logic for Applications In Defense (PLAID) program is developing a heterogeneous compute platform that can support processing of large data arrays. Current computing architectures are subject to scaling, bandwidth, and memory limitations, and the large size of today's chips limits the movement of data resulting in a fundamental trade-off between circuit size and data throughput. The PLAID program will break this paradigm with new architecture development and will achieve more than a 10X increase in on-chip bandwidth. In addition to the development of this new device, the PLAID program will expedite deployment into DoD systems by engaging the defense industrial base to map DoD-relevant radio frequency (RF) processing problems onto the new architecture. These RF problems may include element-level digital beamforming, multi-target tracking radar applications, and synthetic aperture radar processing. Once applications are mapped onto the new processor, the implementation will be programmed and tested with the intent that the use of the new device developed by commercial industry will directly transition into an asymmetric advantage for the DoD and will be used by the defense industrial base in emerging applications.

FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 decrease reflects a shift from fabrication to final testing. Title: Technologies for Mixed-mode Ultra Scaled Integrated Circuits (T-MUSIC) Description: The Technologies for Mixed-mode Ultra Scaled Integrated Circuits (T-MUSIC) program is developing an on- shore semiconductor foundry platform for very wide band radio frequency (RF) mixed-mode integrated circuit analog-to-digital converters for commercial and military systems. Mixed-mode circuits take analog and RF signals and transform them to digital data for processing in computing systems. As defense and commercial wireless applications move to higher frequencies in order to carry more data traffic, integrating the broadband mixed-mode circuitry with high speed digital processing logic onto one chip becomes imperative to avoid data transfer bottlenecks. T-MUSIC seeks to integrate high-speed, high-performance analog and digital electronics together in highly-scaled silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) foundries on-shore. Such processes will enable the high levels of integration and performance needed for DoD-relevant and commercial 5G/6G applications. A goal of the T-MUSIC program is to enable very wide bandwidth wireless operations beyond 100 gigahertz (GHz) with low noise and high dynamic range. In addition, T-MUSIC aims to develop next-generation terahertz (THz) mixed- mode devices based on the advanced digital CMOS fabrication platform. The T-MUSIC program will establish advanced on- shore foundry capabilities to establish a long-term domestic world-class RF mixed-mode system-on-chip technology for intended transition to DoD and commercial applications.

FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 decrease reflects the shift from demonstrating foundational mixed-mode analog/digital building blocks in domestic foundries to transition. Title: Photonics in the Package for Extreme Scalability (PIPES) Description: The Photonics in the Package for Extreme Scalability (PIPES) program aims to develop optical signaling technologies for digital microelectronics. Distributed and parallel computing architectures are now pervasive across all size scales, from personal-scale multicore processing units to enterprise-scale high performance computing systems, and span application domains from consumer electronics to DoD systems. Increasingly, however, the benefits of parallelism are constrained not by the limits of computation at individual nodes but by the movement of data between nodes. PIPES will advance microelectronics capabilities by intimately integrating photonics with advanced integrated electronics to yield system connectivity with an unprecedented combination of high aggregate bandwidth, power efficiency, channel density, and link reach. Specifically, PIPES will develop photonic input/output (I/O) capability for application-specific integrated circuits and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) that are widely used in advanced DoD sensors and radio frequency systems. The goal of the program is improving I/ O bandwidth density, efficiency, and reach by more than 100X to enable disruptive DoD system parallelism and performance scaling. As PIPES technologies mature, they are anticipated to proliferate into central processing units, graphical processing units, and emerging tensor-flow processing units that will impact a wide range of dual-use applications including artificial intelligence, machine learning, large scale emulation, and high performance computing. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to larger scale commercial performers and the Services.

The baseline capability will allow users from across the country to quickly and efficiently develop working prototypes based on early-stage R&D. This will enable a wide range of organizations and stakeholders to accelerate a domestic 3DHI ecosystem, similar to how foundry access enabled fabless design companies and their associated ecosystems to proliferate. This research service will feature a baseline fabrication capability for research prototypes via a stable 3DHI process design kit. Users of the research service will have the ability to join multi-project demonstrations runs or dedicated taxi runs. This national accelerator will remove a major impediment to the domestic development of next-generation three-dimensional microsystems and will extend research capabilities beyond those currently being developed worldwide. The research services will incorporate the ability to fabricate unique microsystem prototypes using a wide range of devices and materials, integrating the most advanced manufacturing and assembly technologies across silicon, compound semiconductors, photonics, MEMS, and other advanced microelectronics technologies.

FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The Description: The Millimeter Arrays (MIDAS) program is developing a common millimeter wave phased array tile that is scalable to large arrays to provide wideband frequency agility from 18 gigahertz (GHz) to 50 GHz with element-level digital beamforming. Millimeter wave systems are used today to achieve physical security through the use of narrow antenna beams in a small form-factor for applications that include satellite communications and tactical line-of-sight communications such as in the F-22 and F-35. One of the challenges of using directional communications is establishing a link when both platforms are mobile. Element-level digital beamforming allows a platform to listen in all directions to facilitate discovering and linking with neighboring platforms. Digital beamforming also enables multiple beams so that one platform can communicate with several neighbors simultaneously, increasing network throughput and robustness against unexpected outages. To achieve these goals, MIDAS is developing a common digital phased array tile that can be used to build large arrays from this common block. MIDAS uses advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology to develop the core transceiver elements at a size and power consumption compatible with current millimeter wave systems, and employs a combination of advanced packaging and high-performance compound semiconductors to build the power amplifiers and wideband apertures necessary to make a complete system. Technologies from this program are intended for transition through commercial industry to the Services. FY 2022 Plans: - Complete fabrication of millimeter wave 64-element digital phased arrays in advanced CMOS co-integrated with compound semiconductor power amplifiers and wideband apertures and begin array testing. - Begin scaling 64-element designs and create test plans for millimeter wave 256-element digital phased arrays. - Complete advancements in the fundamental technologies relevant to millimeter wave digital arrays in the areas of converters, filters, reflects program completion.14.555 10.862 - Title: Beyond Scaling - Access Description: The Beyond Scaling - Access program demonstrates design and fabrication of advanced electronics, to include collaborations with leading industry players.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2021 The Space-Based Adaptive Communications Node (Space-BACN) program seeks to create a reconfigurable intersatellite optical communications terminal that has low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) and easily integrates onto small satellites, as well as a methodology for cross-constellation command and control (C2). Based on technologies developed in the Dynamic Network Adaptation for Mission Optimization (DyNAMO) program (budgeted in this PE/Project), Space-BACN will enable on-orbit communications and data relay between heterogeneous satellite constellations that operate on different optical intersatellite link (OISL) specifications. Today's government and commercial OISL-equipped satellites are unable to communicate with each other due to reliance on single-waveform terminals and a lack of standardization for waveform specifications. Space- BACN will overcome this challenge by developing a modular, reconfigurable optical terminal that is standard-agnostic and able to support most current and future OISL protocols. Space-BACN will also develop a C2 system that controls access and configures connectivity between constellations based on availability and mission requirements.

Resilient Networked Distributed Mosaic Communications (RNDMC) Description: Resilient Distributed Mosaic Communications (RNDMC) aims to provide Beyond-Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) tactical communications for an Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) environment by developing low-cost expendable transceivers that may be hand carried or hosted on ground platforms, autonomous air vehicles, high altitude platforms, and low-cost/low earth orbit satellites. RNDMC plans to use a combination of synchronized transceivers and tactical radios to enhance desired signals and reject intentional and unintentional interference. Based on technologies developed in the Protected Forward Communications (PFC) program (budgeted in this PE/Project), RNDMC will design, develop, and demonstrate a distributed field of expendable transceivers, providing a robust, low-cost, BLOS tactical communications system that degrades gracefully as transceiver nodes become unavailable. The RNDMC goal is a demonstration on ground and air platforms and will not be reliant on Global Positioning System (GPS). Technologies from this program will transition to the Services.

FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 increase reflects a shift from initial evaluation planning to strategy development. Title: Protected Forward Communications (PFC) Description: The collaborative application of combat power in ground tactical operations demands reliable exchange of rich information and precise coordination of actions across various echelons. These operations take place over three critical conversations: (1) to coordinate the actions of a local group, (2) to coordinate group and airborne assets, and (3) to interact with rear echelon command. The communication links over which these three conversations take place are at risk from jamming and geolocation operations conducted with increasingly sophisticated exploitation and denial technology employed by our adversaries. This problem is compounded by demands for ever-increasing capacity of these links. The Protected Forward Communications (PFC) program will build on technical advances in resilient, efficient, and aware communications technology to design a single communication architecture to protect all three conversations from jamming and geolocation. PFC is generally applicable to small unit operations and is particularly relevant to the close air support (CAS) function typically executed by the Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) or Forward Air Controller (FAC). The PFC program will transition to the Services.

FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 decrease reflects shift from prototyping and over-the-air testing to integration and demonstration. Title: Network Universal Persistence (Network UP) Description: Current radios send network control information and data using the same wireless link. This produces a common failure mode when that wireless link degrades. In many of today's military wireless networks, even brief wireless link outages create a loss of network connectivity that can take minutes to recover once the wireless link is re-established. During these network outages, data transmission is not possible. The Network UP program will develop and demonstrate radio technology that maintains network reliability through periods of frequent signal degradation that routinely occur in military operational environments. Isolation of critical control channel information in a separate, robust wireless link will allow creation of a protected control channel that can maintain network reliability even when the data channel is lost. The Network UP program will develop technology and a prototype system that enables military wireless networks to send data over dynamic, unstable wireless links. The program will develop approaches to separate the control and data planes across different wireless links and design and implement mechanisms to maintain synchronization across those separate links. Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services. FY 2022 Plans: - Test and verify that the operation of the integrated hardware and software meets program goals. - Demonstrate network connectivity and data throughput on wireless channels in the presence of high levels of interference. FY 2023 Plans: - Transition Network UP technology into the U.S. Army's Integrated Network Technology program of record. FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2023 decrease reflects a shift from demonstrations to transition efforts.16.829 10.998 9.213 Title: Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) Description: The goal of the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) program was to develop innovative networking and information sharing approaches to enable U.S. and coalition forces to coordinate tactical operations effectively, efficiently, and securely by eliminating today's prohibitive security cost and complexity barriers. SHARE provided the level of security provided by today's communications systems, while managing trust at the tactical edge, and provided new opportunities for U.S. and coalition forces to gain and maintain a tactical advantage on the battlefield.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Network-Centric Warfare Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts. It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission. The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system. The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations. Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly increased capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness. Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents using systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants. These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often co-located and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable. Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning. Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies. Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required. This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic/operational level by generating targeting options against opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tactical/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms and tools, which acquire targets of opportunity and cue network-based analysis of likely enemy operations thus maximizing the effectiveness of ground forces in stability and support operations. The Maritime Systems project is identifying, developing and rapidly maturing critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept. Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems. Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea, and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.

Title: Prototype Resilient Operations Testbed for Expeditionary Urban Systems of Systems (PROTEUS) Description: The Prototype Resilient Operations Testbed for Expeditionary Urban Systems of Systems (PROTEUS) program is demonstrating that a dynamically composable Mosaic warfare approach provides superior performance and adaptability in the dynamic, uncertain environment imposed on U.S. warfighters by urban combat operations. PROTEUS will be adaptive to an inherently dynamic and fluid environment that will account for the environmental influence of non-combatants in urban combat as well as kinetic warfighting. Technologies will be integrated using systems of systems principles developed under the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program, budgeted in this PE/Project. To support concept development, testing, and warfighter interaction, the program will also develop a supporting virtual testbed. Technologies from this program will be transitioned to the Services. FY 2022 Plans: - Document and transition software to Marine Corps for future use. - Support development of program software features requested by the Marine Corps. FY 2022 to FY 2023 Increase/Decrease Statement: reflects program completion.13.136 8.030 - Title: System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) Description: The System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program implemented an architecture framework capable of assessing and demonstrating potential operational benefits of integrating various system capabilities to improve mission success in contested environments. Such assessments optimized system-level trades of requirements and architectures to leverage an integrated set of system characteristics and capabilities. The demonstration assessment metrics measured individual and combined system performance to streamline resource allocation to maximize operational impact. In addition, providing a modeling and simulation (M&S) environment to assess complex systems enabled greater utility of emerging system technologies, since they can be assessed in near-real-world simulations without the real-world costs of testing fully integrated systems. The program also developed system synthesis and integration technologies that enabled rapid assimilation of new and off-the-shelf technologies into the system of systems architecture.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Maritime Systems project is identifying, developing and rapidly maturing critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network-centric warfare concept. Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network-centric systems. Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea, and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network-centric forces. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ Manta Ray program is developing and demonstrating a new class of long-duration, long-range unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) at an acquisition and lifecycle cost significantly less than current payload-capable UUVs. This new class of UUV will give the combatant commander an amplification of capacity without disrupting current operations by remaining independent of manned vessels and ports once deployed. The primary goal of the Manta Ray program is to open a design space for future UUVs capable of both long duration missions and large payload capacity. A secondary goal of the program is to advance key technologies benefiting other naval designs such as low lifecycle cost UUV operations, energy management technologies to enable long-duration operations, biofouling reduction technologies, and long-duration navigational enablers. The anticipated transition partner is the U.S. Navy. FY 2022 Plans: - Continue risk reduction testing of subsystems in controlled maritime environments. - Conduct testing of vehicle software and autonomy in simulation and surrogate environments. - Conduct scaled testing of integrated vehicle in controlled maritime environments. - Commence fabrication and integration of full-scale vehicle. FY 2023 Plans: - Conduct at-sea demonstration of key subsystems. - Complete fabrication and integration of full-scale vehicle. - Conduct preliminary testing of full-scale vehicle in controlled maritime environments.23.562 29.500 38.569 Volume 1 - 214 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603766E: NETWORK-CENTRIC WARFARE TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 9 of 17 R-1 Line #62Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity FY 2021 FY 2022 FY 2023 - Conduct at-sea demonstration of full-scale vehicle performing full range of behaviors and capabilities.

Title: No Manning Required Ship (NOMARS) Description: No Manning Required Ship (NOMARS) is developing small, low-cost, disaggregated naval platforms to demonstrate the ability to perform persistent power projection and force application combat missions currently conducted from large, high- value capital ships. The NOMARS program will design a ship that can operate autonomously for long durations at sea, enabling a ship design process that eliminates considerations associated with crew. NOMARS focuses on exploring novel approaches to the design of the sea frame (the ship without mission systems) while accommodating representative payload size, weight, and power. The goal of the program is to demonstrate the feasibility of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) that operate autonomously for months to years without human intervention, in large numbers, with only periodic, depot-based maintenance. This capability will enable disaggregated persistent USVs, allowing the surface fleet to credibly threaten peer adversaries and negate their investments in high-cost weapon systems designed to counter large naval targets such as aircraft carriers. A successful NOMARS program will prove feasibility of a small unmanned ship with significantly improved reliability and functional performance over current USVs providing a pathway to allow a distributed lethality concept to become viable: small ships, in large numbers, each of which is individually low-cost and low-value, but in aggregate presents a significant deterrent. The anticipated transition partner is the U.S. Navy. FY 2022 Plans: - Continue preliminary design of multiple concept vessels. - Conduct Preliminary Design Review of NOMARS concept vessels. - Initiate demonstrator vessel development.

The Sea Train program is developing and demonstrating connectors and approaches to couple the vessels, the control laws required to drive the vessel in open ocean conditions, sensor approaches to understand the wave environment to efficiently navigate the vessel, and the autonomy required to connect and disconnect the vessels without human intervention. The goal of this effort is to improve transport efficiency over what can be achieved with current monohull designs. This allows for the efficient transport of smaller vessels into and out of theater, an operation that is normally accomplished today by carrying smaller vessels on board larger vessels or reliance on at-sea refueling of smaller vessels. The anticipated transition partner is the Navy.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Sensor Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability and battle damage assessment. The Surveillance and Countermeasures Technology project funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability, and battle damage assessment. Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars. This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner. This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems. In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats. The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery. The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets. The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement, and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2021 Title: Moving Target Recognition (MTR) Description: Based on technologies developed under the Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) Technology program (previously budgeted in 0603767E, SEN-02), the Moving Target Recognition (MTR) program seeks to enable the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors to detect, track, image, and automatically recognize moving ground targets within an area of interest. SAR sensors provide the capability to detect and identify high-value targets in all weather conditions but only when the targets are stationary due to limitations in traditional SAR processing. Ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radars are capable of detecting and tracking moving targets, but they cannot form recognizable images of targets. MTR will overcome the limitations of traditional SAR and improve the operational utility of widely deployed SAR sensors on many different types of platforms. The recognition capability will enable new concepts of operation for maintaining persistent custody of high-value targets on the move. Unlike GMTI, which loses custody if the track is broken due to terrain or other factors, MTR-enabled SAR sensors will be able to tolerate coverage gaps by reacquiring and reestablishing identification of the moving targets. Technology developed under MTR will transition to the Services. FY 2022 Plans: - Develop novel MTR algorithms for ground moving target detection, tracking, and imaging with SAR sensors. - Plan and conduct airborne data collect experiments involving ground-truthed moving military vehicles to test the MTR algorithms and collection techniques. - Analyze MTR algorithm performance using the airborne experiment data.4.500 15.862 19.073 Volume 1 - 227 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 4 of 12 R-1 Line #63Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2023 Defense Agency Date: April 2022 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 SENSOR (Number/Name) SEN-01 / SURVEILLANCE AND COUNTERMEASURES TECHNOLOGY B.

Title: Aerial Dragnet Description: Aerial Dragnet seeks to detect multiple small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in complex and/or urban terrain before they are within Line-Of-Sight (LOS) of friendly assets. Unlike traditional air targets, small UASs pose a special threat in urban terrain for several reasons: they can fly at low altitudes between buildings, they are small making them difficult to sense, and they move at slow speeds making them difficult to differentiate from other moving objects. Moreover, the development of small UASs is driven by commercial technologies, which make them rapidly adaptable and very easy to use. Building upon research conducted in the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), Aerial Dragnet will perform surveillance using an architecture consisting of networked sensor payloads deployed on buildings, masts and aerial platforms. The ability to see over and into urban terrain allows Aerial Dragnet to detect, track, and classify UAS incursions rapidly, thus enabling multiple defeat options. Aerial Dragnet sensor payloads are low-cost and comprised of signal processing software, sensor hardware, and networking for distributed, autonomous operation.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery. The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets. The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement, and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments.
