We had 139 respondents, whichwas 15% higher than our 2015 survey; your thoughts, ideas, andopinions, including critiques, are important to us. We are workingthrough all the comments with an eye toward ways to improveWVDL's service and responsiveness for your practice or business.In April we welcomed new administrative team members. Our new human resources specialist is CorissaDaines. Corissa comes to the WVDL from the University of Wisconsin Madison Campus central Office ofHuman Resources. She brings with her important and relevant experience and skills, insight and positiveenergy which will benefit the WVDL Staff and WVDL in general. Welcome Corissa! We are also happy to announce the advancement of Dr. Nicole Aulik to the Interim Section Head ofMicrobiology. Dr. Aulik has already been doing a great job of science management and supervising thesection for the past 1-2 years and we are looking forward to having her insight, skills, and expertise on theadministrative team. Congratulations, Dr. Aulik, and we at WVDL and our valued clients look forward toworking with you. We hope you have a great summer. Please contact WVDL including me or our Client Services andOutreach Coordinator Dr. Keith Poulsen, directly, anytime with questions, concerns, and/or comments. Phil Bochsler, DVM PhD, DACVPDirector MicrobiologyShipping Isolates for Autogenous Vaccine Development: The bacteriology section would like to askclients to make requests for isolates to be shipped for autogenous vaccine development as immediatelyas possible. Please write on the WVDL General Submission Form if you suspect that a pathogen mightbe isolated that could be used for an autogenous vaccine. Although the WVDL understands that it takestime to determine if an isolate is to be used for autogenous vaccine development, it is imperative that theisolate be as healthy as possible prior to shipment to an autogenous vaccine development laboratory. When isolates are either subcultured or maintained for long periods of time at refrigeration or roomtemperature, the bacteria alter their gene expression, which could affect vaccine efficacy. Please call(608-262-5432) or email the WVDL if you require an isolate to be shipped for autogenous vaccinedevelopment. Isolates are shipped from both the Barron and Madison laboratories.Avian Mycoplasma Culture: The avian Mycoplasma culture has been discontinued and replaced withthe Avian Mycoplasma RT-PCR, which includes three Mycoplasma targets: M. synoviae, M. meleagridis,and M. gallisepticum. These can be ordered as a multiplex PCR or as individual PCR targets. The switchfrom culture to PCR greatly enhances the turnaround time as culture could take up to four weeks. ThePCR is run at the Madison laboratory.Prototheca Isolation Media: Additionally, the WVDLhas been validating a Prototheca isolation media,which has recently passed approval. Protothecaisolation media will now be automatically added to bulktank cultures. Internal observations havedemonstrated a 10% reduction in sensitivity (to 89.7%)when milk is frozen. If you suspect Prototheca will beisolated from a bulk tank sample(s), please save asmall aliquot of the bulk tank sample(s) and do notfreeze that sample(s). The rest of the bulk tank sample should be frozen since the bulk tank culture isquantitative. Freezing the sample insures accurate bacterial counts, but since Prototheca species are analgae, freezing compromises their cell wall.To keep costs low, we ask that clients specifically request the Prototheca isolation media when needed formastitis milk culture submissions. Prototheca may be requested for milk mastitis culture submissions bychecking the box for Prototheca on the Milk culture Submission Form. The specific media aids in thesensitivity of Prototheca detection although Prototheca do grow readily on blood agar. Prototheca,isolation can be added to any mastitis milk culture for $2.75. Prototheca isolation is available at both theBarron and Madison laboratories.Tritrichomonas foetus Submissions: The bacteriology section would like to ask clients who submitgenital washings in the InPouch for Tritrichomonas foetus culture or PCR to please roll down thepouches prior to submission if no direct read is needed. The genital washing needs to be mixed with thecontents of the InPouch within 24 hours in order to inhibit bacterial growth and promote Tritrichomonasgrowth. However, if direct reads are desired, please keep the genital washing in the top of theInPouch. A reminder that the culture requires 7 days and the PCR requires a full 24 hours incubationprior to PCR, which are run on Mondays at the Madison laboratory. Client ServicesNew Team Member - In May, we will be welcoming a new memberto the Client Services Team. Rachel Pressley will be working withsample login, accessioning, and reception. Rachel is moving backto the Midwest from North Carolina, welcome Rachel! Annual Bull Stud/Bovine Genetics Meeting - We have been busywith outreach and extension, working with the Professional DairyProducers of Wisconsin, the Dairy Calf and Heifer Conference, andthe Dane County Regional Veterinary Medical Association. OnTuesday, July 25th, 2016 we will host our annual Summer Bull Stud/Bovine Genetics Meeting. Themeeting focuses on testing for export and regulatory purposes. Please contact us if you are interested injoining the meeting in July. This meeting is free of charge.Charges Added for Media and Supplies Orders - Effective June 1st, we will be adding a flat rateshipping and handling charge on all media and supply orders. In Wisconsin and surrounding areas, mediaand testing kits will be sent UPS ground for next day delivery. For all other destinations, UPS next day airservice will be used. All box and liquid nitrogen tank returns will be sent UPS ground. See below for flatfee pricing schedule.Media/Kit OrdersNext Day Air: New Flat Shipping and Handling = $25.00Ground: New Flat Shipping and Handling = $10.00 ReturnsBox Returns: New Flat rate = $6.00Liquid Nitrogen Tank Returns: New Flat Rate = $10.00 Electronic Spreadsheet Submissions - We appreciate the adoption by many of our clients of ourelectronic spreadsheet submissions. On any case with more than 10 animals in the submission weestimate our accessioning process to be 10 times faster compared to handwritten or typed forms.Electronic spreadsheets also eliminate data transfer errors. For perspective on a busy day, the WVDLreceives ~2000 specimens, which have ~10,000 data fields to be filled or confirmed for accuracy by theClient Services staff!! Gradual movement of large accessions to electronic spreadsheets allows us to bemore accurate and efficient and decreases turnaround time for results. Please contact us with questionsabout how to use electronic spreadsheet submissions.Staff Spotlight: Dr. Don Sockett, DVM PhD, DACVIMWhere are you from and how did you become a WVDLteam member? I was born on a dairy farm in Ontario, Canada and attendedveterinary school at the University of Guelph. I did aninternship and residency program in food animal medicineand surgery at the University of Minnesota and ColoradoState University, respectively. I did my PhD at the Universityof Wisconsin-Madison. I worked in the state veterinarians'office (DATCP) for 4 years as the ruminant speciesepidemiologist and came to the WVDL in 1995. How long have you been working at WVDL? 21 years What parts of your job do you enjoy the most? Interacting with practicing veterinarians and dairyman plus discussing interesting cases with WVDL staff. Do you have any hobbies? Competitive horse riding. My son is a world champion equestrian having won a world championship in2011 riding his American Saddlebred at Louisville, KY. Dr. Sockett talking to the Dairy Calf and Heifer Association in April of 2016 about cleaning and sanitation of automated calf feeders. Pathology SciencesPathology ServicesDue to an influx of cases with potential legal ramifications to our Diagnostic Pathologyservice we have a few frequently asked questions (FAQs) that can help save time andmoney for you and your clients while getting the highest quality diagnostic work. What types of cases might be considered to be \"legal\"?These are examples of situations that might define a \"legal\" case:Cases in which there is potential litigation that may be initiated by the animal owner, legalauthority, veterinarian, or other party.The necropsy, or other testing, is required for an insurance claim or other settlement.The necropsy, or other testing, is required as part of a police investigation.How are legal cases handled differently?Legal cases are handled at WVDL with additional documentation, sample retention and communication.Documentation includes:Maintaining a chain of custodyTaking photographs of case materials and findings +/- radiographsOur usual attention to detail and record-keeping. All sample material that is not consumed in theprocess of testing is retained in long-term secure storage.Potential communication with law enforcement, humane officers, attorneys, government officials,etc. Does WVDL have special credentials for handling legal cases?Credible expertise is very important under the scrutiny of litigation. Our proof of expert status takesseveral forms, including our AAVLD* accreditation. To be fully accredited, such as WVDL, a lab mustmaintain impeccable records, perform regular proficiency testing, and employ credentialed professionalssuch as board-certified veterinarians (ACVP*, ACVIM*). *AAVLD = American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians*ACVP = American College of Veterinary Pathologists*ACVIM = American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine Is there a fee for legal cases?Yes, it is currently $165. The fee is only applied to cases in which the additional considerations for legalcases were actually applied. Therefore, there is no harm in communicating that there is even the potentiallegal concern so that samples are not discarded before legal status is decided. In the long run, a legalnecropsy handled properly could save thousands of dollars in legal fees and lost time. When/how should legal concerns be communicated to WVDL?Inform us on the submission form or by any other means of verbal or written communication. Pleasenotify the WVDL staff at the time of, or prior to, submission. Knowing of legal concerns as soon aspossible will ensure that a proper chain of custody is initiated. Also, we want to be sure to retain samplematerial, making sure that sample(s) are not accidentally discarded as part of normal disposal of non-legalcases. How does legal status affect disposition of an animal's remains?Even though cremation may be requested, invoiced and paid, the animal is not released until we havesigned approval for release of remains from the submitter. In general, we advise against release as longas litigation is pending. Other considerations:As for all cases, legal necropsies must be submitted by a veterinarian and are not accepteddirectly from animal owners.WVDL retains the right to refuse out-of-state legal cases. Chemistry & Toxicology Report Changes - There are a few changesto our chemistry and toxicology reports. First, element values for tissues(kidney, liver and brain) will now be reported on a dry weight basis,which is consistent with our peer veterinary diagnostic laboratories.Additionally, the reference ranges reported for tissues and serumsanalyzed for elements, Vitamins A and E will be updated to thosecompiled between 2009 and 2014 at the Diagnostic Center ofPopulation and Animal Health (DCPAH) at Michigan State University.Prior to the update, WVDL used the previous ranges from DCPAH,published in the 1980's. As a result of the adoption of the DCPAHreference ranges, the following elements will be reported with the Element Panel for liver and kidney;arsenic, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, molybdenum, selenium and zinc. Copper, iron, seleniumand zinc will be reported in the element panel for serum. Heavy metals and other elements may berequested Barron Laboratory EIA Testing - Equine Infectious Anemia (EIA)submissions are tested daily at the WVDL BarronLaboratory. Submissions received by noon will havesame day testing. Samples should contain 1 ml serum,be refrigerated and shipped with a cold pack. WVDLaccepts three submission types for EIA testing:1. Electronic submissions through the APHIS VeterinaryServices Process Streaming (VSPS) database. VSPSprovides free data repository for laboratory testsubmissions and results. An accredited veterinarian account with VSPS is required. Results areavailable via the VSPS portal by the end of the testing day. 2. Electronic submissions through Global Vet Link. Global Vet Link provides a real-time datarepository for laboratory test submissions and results. A veterinary account with Global Vet Link isrequired. Test results are available by the end of the testing day via the Global Vet Link web site. 3. Official Federal VS Form 10-11. Test results are recorded on this form. Veterinarian and ownercopies are placed in USPS mail the day after testing.Please ensure that the animal name/identification on the tube clearly matches the submission form. Samples that cannot be matched to the submission form may result in delayed testing, or requireresubmission. Please visit our website for additional information regarding the EIA submission options.Liquid Feed Bacteria Counts - The WVDL Barron Laboratory offers testing for Bacteria Counts inNeonatal Mammalian Liquid Feeds (CFU/mL). Remember to package and ship appropriately especiallyas the weather gets warmer in order to keep samples frozen during transit.Acceptable sample type= colostrum, raw/pasteurized waste milk & reconstituted milk replacerCollect samples in vials and immediately freeze. A half-filled vial is sufficient sample amount.Sample must remain frozen in transit. See WVDL's shipping program.Use Milk Submission form, check \"aerobic/coliform/E. coli count\" test and indicate the sample type.Send directly to Barron to avoid delays in test results turnaround time.Set up M, T, W if received by noon. Results in 48 hrs. Please visit our website for Submission and Interpretation Guidelines for this test type. VirologyCanine Influenza Testing & Research - The virology unit has been at the forefront of testing andresearch for canine influenza since the outbreak started in 2015. We have tested thousands of samplesfor the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine (SVM) shelter medicine program and forveterinarians around the state. Practitioners were alerted to several localized outbreaks in mid-March butthere have been no additional positive cases in Wisconsin identified at our laboratory or the CornellDiagnostic Laboratory in April. We do not have access to results tested by private laboratories. On theresearch front, we have collaborated with Dr Sandra Newbury (Director of the SVM Shelter MedicineProgram) on two studies. Our first joint publication detailing the extended shedding found in dogs withH3N2 can be found in this month's JAVMA (May 1, 2016, vol 248, No 9 pp 1022-1026). Newer researchthis spring revealed that CIV H3N2 can infect cats. A shelter in Indiana had the first extended outbreak. Itwas clinically recognized by Dr Newbury and confirmed by real time PCR and virus isolation at WVDL.Initial sequence data reveals homology to H3N2. EM Proficiency Program Developed by WVDLElectron Microscopist Radi - Our electronmicroscopist, Craig Radi, presented his poster on aproficiency program he developed for ElectronMicroscopy (EM) at the \"Global Health Symposium2016\" March 30th at the Health Sciences LearningCenter. The proficiency program partners with 18laboratories across the United States including Hawaiiand Canada, to help maintain expertise in theidentification of viruses by EM.Regulatory Testing - Bovine herpes virus 1 serological tests are commonly required for movement ofanimals or products. To serve the genetics industry we offer three serological tests, all of which detect thepresence of antibodies to BHV-1.1. IBRSN is a serum neutralization assay which is offered for historical reasons but it is notrecommended for use to qualify animals for movement because of low sensitivity. The assay willdetect neutralizing antibodies. However, the virus incubation step with antibody is only 1 hourwhich accounts for its lowered sensitivity of 77%.2. OIEIBRSN is the approved serum neutralization assay in the manual produced by the WorldOrganization of Animal Health (OIE). It differs from IBRSN by the length of the neutralizationperiod (24 hrs) which makes it a far more sensitive assay.3. IBR CELISA is a competitive ELISA directed to an epitope on the glycoprotein C on the virussurface. This test is rapid and can be completed in 3 hours unlike the SN tests which mustincubate 3-5 days.Results from the OIE IBR SN and the CELISA usually agree. However it's wise to test with both assaysbefore qualifying an animal for entry to a bull stud. This will provide better assurance of the true status ofan animal especially if the antibody level is close to the threshold of detection.Unfortunately, there are occasional test results that may be nonspecific. If we suspect a nonspecificreaction, we report as \"retest required\" and follow up with procedures (e.g. heat treatment or a freeze-thaw cycle) to remove the source of the cross reaction. Collecting and testing a new sample sometimeseliminates the non-specific reaction. As a last resort, taking an animal off feed for a day, then re-samplingand testing can help.
