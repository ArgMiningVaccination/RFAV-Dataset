Historically, over 75% of our fellows have moved on to join academic centers (see [past fellows](/departments/medicine/divisions/pulmonary-medicine/past-fellows/)). Our three-year combined Pulmonary and Critical Care Fellowship program encompasses a diverse clinical experience, with a focus on education and abundant research opportunities. Fellows primarily rotate through three hospitals - [Montefiore Medical Center](https://www.montefiore.org/west/) (Moses Campus), [Jack D. Weiler hospital](https://www.montefiore.org/east/) (Einstein Campus), and [Jacobi Medical Center](https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/jacobi/contact-us/). These hospitals provide healthcare services to more than two million, a largely diverse, underserved and immigrant population, in the Bronx and Westchester County. Over the course of three years, fellows are exposed to a wide breadth of pulmonary pathology - common and rare respiratory conditions such as asthma, COPD, environmental and interstitial lung diseases, sleep disorders, lung cancer, lung transplant and pulmonary infections such as tuberculosis. Fellows receive in-depth training and know-how in all aspects of critical illnesses - sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, ventilator strategies, point-of-care ultrasound and ECMO. Our fellows leave the fellowship program capable of providing science-driven, patient-centered care, confident in performing advanced pulmonary and critical care procedures such as EBUS bronchoscopy and ultrasound-guided in-dwelling pleural catheter placement. First-year fellows are introduced to the basics of pulmonary and critical care medicine with a core summer curriculum and a simulation-based workshop (for airway management, bronchoscopy, chest tube placement, point-of-care ultrasound, etc.). Throughout the fellowship period, there is also a focus on didactics, case-based learning, physiology, interdisciplinary conferences (radiology, oncology and pathology), journal clubs and supervised hands-on skill development. Dedicated research curriculum and elective time introduce fellows to necessary epidemiological and biostatistical skills in clinical and translational research. Fellows are strongly encouraged to get involved in mentored clinical research and quality improvement projects to understand the practical aspects of research methodologies and the implementation of data-driven protocols to improve patient care. Thank you for your interest in the Montefiore Einstein Pulmonary and Critical Care Fellowship Program. We are extremely proud of our fellows and what we have to offer in terms of training and mentorship as they begin their journey to becoming experts in the field. Please feel free to contact us with further questions. Overview Accreditation Our Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Fellowship Training Program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). The three-year program meets eligibility requirements for both pulmonary and critical care medicine boards and trains graduates for a career of their choosing in pulmonary and critical care medicine. Office of Diversity and Inclusion Vision [Einstein Office of Diversity and Inclusion](/diversity/) - furthering our legacy of equity. To be a safe, inclusive, and just institution of medicine, science, and education that attracts, supports, and promotes people and voices from historically marginalized groups, actively counters exclusionary and oppressive systems, and centers our diverse Bronx community and beyond as we pursue responsive science and health equity.
