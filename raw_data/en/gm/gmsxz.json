Commitment to the discovery of novel therapeutic drugs We have initiated a collaborative research effort to identify drugs active against COVID-19 with the Hokkaido University Research Center for Zoonosis Control. We are still in the early stages of this effort, but we have already identified a number of promising lead compounds from our internal in vitro studies. This is one of the top priority projects for Shionogi. We are accelerating our drug discovery efforts with the aim of starting clinical trials in FY2020, and we are committed to the pursuit of effective compounds given the possibility of a long-lasting outbreak and pandemic. 2. Commitment to vaccine discovery UMN Pharma Inc., a group company of Shionogi, is pursuing the discovery and development of a recombinant protein vaccine for COVID-19 in a project supported by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) [Representative of Research and Development: Dr. Hideki Hasegawa, Director of Influenza Virus Research Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases], which began in March, 2020. 3. Commitment to offer COVID-19 antibody test kit Regarding the COVID-19 Antibody Test Kit1 that was the subject of a public announcement on March 17, 2020, Shionogi has just entered into an agreement with Micro Blood Science Inc., the licensor of the kit. Currently we are undertaking performance testing to demonstrate its suitability for practical use in Japan, and are collecting clinical data for regulatory approval. In addition, Shionogi plans to initiate further clinical research to add to the body of evidence for the kit. We are focused on confirming its utility as an in vitro diagnostic agent and using it to contribute to medical care as soon as possible. * Infectious Disease Control Guide (Only In Japanese) \"Kodomo Kansensho Navi\" (information on pediatric infectious disease) : [http://www.shionogi.co.jp/infection_navi/](/jp/ja/sustainability/informations-for-id/infection_navi.html) Information to address the risk of infectious disease spread during international events (including information of COVID-19) : [http://www.shionogi.co.jp/msg_navi/](/jp/ja/sustainability/informations-for-id/msg_navi.html) To refer to our \"Infection Control Guidelines for Nurseries\", see : [http://www.shionogi.co.jp/nursery/](/jp/ja/sustainability/informations-for-id/nursery.html) Information on the impact of the novel coronavirus on daily life: Prime Minister's Office of Japan: Useful Information on the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) [http://japan.kantei.go.jp/ongoingtopics/coronavirus_info_e.html](http://japan.kantei.go.jp/ongoingtopics/coronavirus_info_e.html) Information related to disease caused by the novel coronavirus: Cabinet Secretariat: The Novel Coronavirus Infection Control: (only in Japanese) [https://corona.go.jp/](https://corona.go.jp/) MHLW: Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare : About Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/newpage_00032.html](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/newpage_00032.html) CDC: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsummary.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsummary.html) WHO: World Health Organization : Coronavirus [https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1) Forward-Looking Statements This announcement contains forward-looking statements.
