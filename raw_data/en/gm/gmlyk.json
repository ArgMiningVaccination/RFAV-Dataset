With a background in clinical research, she blends the wisdom of ancient medicine with the cutting-edge knowledge gained from modern science. She feels strongly that each of her patients is a unique complex being who requires an individualized comprehensive approach in order to facilitate healing. Dr. Calhoun sees her role as a guide, rather than a dictator, and enjoys working closely with the patient throughout their healing journey, providing education along the way. Her Background Dr. Calhoun earned her Naturopathic Medical Degree from Bastyr University and graduated summa cum laude from Syracuse University with degrees in Exercise Science and Clinical Nutrition. Her interest in comprehensive health care developed at a young age. While she was pursuing professional athletics, Dr. Calhoun found herself juggling between multiple practitioners in efforts to optimize health and performance. Her awareness in holistic health and curiosity about a better health-care system was further established when she developed her own autoimmune disorder. She immersed herself in her studies and latest research concerning chronic disease, all of which further supported the use of time-tested natural modalities of healing. Her Clinical Interests PEDIATRICS Over the years, Dr. Calhoun has developed a special interest in complex pediatric disorders, including: Autism Spectrum Disorder, ADHD, ODD, PANS/PANDAS, eczema, food allergies and intolerances, and autoimmune conditions. She takes a comprehensive multi-system approach to every one of her patients, which includes exploration of environmental toxicity, gut health, nutrient balance and dietary factors, underlying infections, and prenatal/early life environment. PRECONCEPTION Before Dr. Calhoun started specializing in neurodevelopmental disorders in children, she had a clinical focus in infertility. She was drawn to this area after her own struggle with hypothalamic amenorrhea for 11 years. Once transitioning her focus to children with complex health disorders and having her own child, she realized that thorough preconception care MUST extend beyond just those who are having fertility struggles. She quickly realized that the goal of achieving pregnancy is not enough. \"We must heal mothers (and fathers) prior to pregnancy in order to change this exponential rise in chronic health disorders in children.\" Dr. Calhoun is passionate about preconception care for ALL couples, to not only improve the health outcomes in baby, but also to ensure that mothers enter into pregnancy and motherhood in an optimal state of health. MENTAL HEALTH Dr. Calhoun recognized the importance of mental health from a very young age, as she grew up with a father who was a clinical psychologist. Upon entering into clinical practice, she quickly found that mental health was a key component to every individual's healing journey, and she was determined to understand how she could best approach anxiety and depression in her clients. While pursuing various forms of research and continuing education in this area, she began to develop a clinical specialty in the field of Advanced Nutrient Therapy- an approach to mental health disorders that correct underlying nutritional imbalances (often genetically related) contributing to neurotransmitter imbalances. Dr. Calhoun has a special interest in treating maternal mental health (including postpartum depression and anxiety), ADHD, eating disorders, and behavioral disorders. SPECIALIZED TRAINING Beyond Naturopathic Medical School and training through the Institute of Functional Medicine, Dr. Calhoun has completed additional training through the [Medical Academy of Pediatric Special Needs](https://www.medmaps.org/) and the [Walsh Research Institute ](https://www.walshinstitute.org/)for the use Advanced Nutrient Therapy for Mental Health Disorders. She considers herself and avid student and enjoys staying up to date with the latest research and clinic treatment via her own searches on Pubmed and various forms of continuous education. Preventative Care For The Whole Family When I was nineteen, I developed an autoimmune disorder. A culmination of poor genetics, poor lifestyle choices, and environmental exposures brought about a series of health struggles. Unfortunately, this is not just my story. More and more serious chronic health disorders are developing at younger and younger ages. I love treating those with complex chronic disease, but I've realized that we need to focus more of our efforts as physicians on being proactive rather than reactive. When I became a mother myself, this reality became even more apparent. I created Kith and Kin wellness with the intention of helping educate families on how to create an environment of health within their home and for their children. I'm passionate about helping families, just like my own, heal, grow, and thrive. "}
