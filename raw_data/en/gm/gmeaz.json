The assessment protocol sets out the general expectations for energy use and GHG emissions management as part of the TSM initiative. As with any assessment of a management system, professional judgment is required in assessing the degree of implementation of a system indicator and the quality of management processes and intervention. Application of this protocol will therefore require a level of expertise in auditing and systems assessment and knowledge of and experience in the practice of energy use and GHG emissions management, including relevant regulatory regimes and requirements. This protocol assesses the level of implementation of energy use and GHG emissions management in support of the TSM initiative. It is not, of itself, a guarantee of the effectiveness of energy use and GHG emissions management activities. "}
