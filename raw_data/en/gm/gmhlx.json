A common misconception is that mineral & botanical pigments are \"non-toxic, because they're natural.\" Plants, stones and earths have properties that can be medicinal, neutral, toxic, or even deadly to humans, depending on context of use, degree of exposure, and cumulative practice. It's good to have this in mind when you approach a material that's new to you. First off, protect yourself: don't get arrested for taking rock, clay, earth or sand where it's not legal to do so. In the United States, it's illegal to take anything from National Parks. In Europe and other parts of the world, there are many sites that are protected by local bylaws or are designated Sites of Specific Scientific Interest. Many countries also have laws in pace to protect sites of cultural heritage. If you're traveling in areas like these, be aware that your bag may be screened at the airport, and that arrests for transporting material from protected sites are not uncommon. FORAGING SAFELY FOR WILD PIGMENTS: A FEW GENERAL GUIDELINES Holding a rock in your hand is very different from pulverizing that same rock in a mortar and pestle, moving the dust around, and making paint. Picking up rocks with bare hands is generally considered safe as long as you are not in a contaminated area. Crushing rocks is quite different, however, as it produces dust. Fine dust can damage your health in the following ways: 1. Dust of any kind, even dust officially described as \"non-toxic\" can cause lung damage by blocking the tiny air sacks in your lungs. Consider \"baker's lung,\" a form of asthma that affects bakers regularly exposed to flour dust. Over time, lung blockage will reduce your capacity to absorb oxygen and can lead to serious conditions, such as asthma or silicosis. Non-toxic mineral dusts do not cause health damage when absorbed through the skin, and can even impart beneficial properties \u2014 thus the benefit of clay face masks, etc. 2. Dusts containing heavy metals can cause severe neurological damage, blindness, cancer and other illnesses. These dusts are absorbed through the lungs, but also, significantly, through the skin and eye membranes. See protocol outlined below for protecting from these toxins. Even when the plants or minerals you gather have low toxicity, if they're found in areas that have been made toxic by environmental contamination, then they will carry that contamination. If you choose to forage in contaminated sites, you must protect yourself accordingly- assume you're working with toxic materials. AREAS OF CONTAMINATION Mines. Mine dumps and tailing pits, while often abundant in pigment-rich ores, can be toxic sites that should be avoided unless accompanied by an experienced geologist. Iron oxides, which are considered non-toxic and are the product of various mining operations, can be contaminated by arsenic. Copper mines produce many dangerous toxins. Roadsides in heavily-trafficked places. Gasoline fumes contain heavy metals which can settle out and accumulate on soils in road cuts. Use your judgement to assess risk \u2014 urban roads may have high levels of heavy metal fallout, while backcountry roads have very little. Industrial-scale agricultural sites. Drainage ditches and soils can hold high levels of chemical fertilizers and pesticides that could be detrimental to health. Any other place which has suffered environmental pollution from industry (like superfund sites) or individual household practices (improper storing of household toxins, etc). Calciferous marine bodies. Sadly, due to ocean contaminants, the shells and bones of many ocean creatures contain dangerous levels of heavy metals like lead and mercury. When crushed, these dusts can be extremely toxic and dangerous. Egg shells may also be contaminated. WORKING WITH WILD PIGMENTS: HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF AVOID EXPOSURE TO SILICA DUST Silicon is the second most common element in the Earth's crust, after Oxygen. Silica, or silicon dioxide, is formed from silicon and oxygen atoms, and is the main component of sand (and glass!). It's also found in many rocks. When pulverized into fine dust and inhaled, silica can, over time, cause silicosis, the most common occupational lung disease in the world. Therefore, it's best to be careful to avoid lung exposure to fine silica dust. Don't crush up hard rocks. A hard rock is likely to be a rock with a lot of silica. Look for soft earths or very crumbly rocks that require little effort to pulverize into pigment. Since silica is colorless, it lightens the color of the minerals it presents with, so hard rocks are likely to make very pale pigments. Think, \"glass dust.\" Avoid working with dry material, whenever possible, especially dried clays. Clays have very fine particles, and high levels of silica. Wet clay doesn't pose the same issue. Similarly, any fine pigment is safer to work with when wet. Instead of dry sifting your pigment, consider using a water-based sifting method, known as \"levigation.\" Protect your lungs from exposure. See \"lung protection\" below. Wear eye protection: goggles that wrap around the eye on all sides. Fine dusts can enter the body through the delicate membranes of the eyes. AVOID TOXIC OR CONTAMINATED MINERALS Unless you have a pristine workspace and excellent dust-hygiene practices (see below), it's wise to avoid making pigment with toxic minerals altogether. If you work with pigments that have been prepared elsewhere, and contain toxins, your risk is of course lower, but be sure to protect your skin and lungs from exposure nevertheless. LUNG PROTECTION Wear a well-fitted mask that filters fine dusts, ideally a respirator with changeable filters. Keep your mask on until your space is clean and you've removed and stored your dusty clothes. SKIN PROTECTION Cover your skin. This means not only wearing gloves, but also head-to-toe protection, including a head covering, shoes, and eye protection. Wear \"dedicated clothing.\" Take off your protective clothing when you're finished working with the dust, and wash separately from your regular laundry. Never eat, drink or smoke when working with toxic dust. Shower immediately if your skin or hair are exposed to dust. KEEP YOUR WORKSPACE CLEAN There's no sense in wearing a mask and covering your skin while crushing rocks into pigment if you take your gloves and mask off as soon as you've finished grinding, touch all the dusty surfaces around you, and send billows of dust into the air from your clothing. When you're finished working, carefully wipe down all the surfaces in your workspace and remove & store dusty clothes. TEND THE AIR Do not use a household air purifier. These will circulate the air and disturb the dust. If possible, work outside. If you think you'll be doing a lot of work with dry pigments indoors over time, invest in a high-quality studio air filter with a flexible vent that can be focused right over your work spot. Feeling overwhelmed? Here's brief summary: Forage in places without a history of environmental contamination. Avoid mines. If you're unsure about the environment, wear gloves when picking up rocks or scooping soil. Cover your skin and hair, and wear a respirator or dust mask when grinding toxic or silica-rich minerals into fine particles. Crush rocks that crumble easily. Avoid hard, glassy rocks. Avoid working with dry clays. Work outside, open windows (if there aren't active breezes), and/or work near an air filter that can target your work spot. Clean up carefully when you're done to remove all dust. Shower after exposure and wash your (dedicated!) work clothes regularly. Never eat, smoke, or drink while working, and never use your pigment tools in "}
