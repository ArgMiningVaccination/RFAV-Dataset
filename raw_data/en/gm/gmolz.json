Printed in the United States of America Dedication To my grandchildren Nathan, Alissa, Margaret Donna, Susan, and Madeline Contents Foreword ix Acknowledgements xi Preface xiii Thesaurus 1 English to Roots Index 975 Works Consulted 989 About the Author 991 Foreword When you read these words you probably do not fully understand what you have in your hands. Were I to say that you have a whole dictionary in your hands, you might find that unremarkable; we often think of thesauri , those treasure -books of words, as mere exte nsions of dictionaries anyway. But if I were to say that you had a lexicographical library in your hands, you might first wonder at the meaning of 'lexicographical' \u2014you may look it up in this book \u2014and then express a note of incredulity at my claim. Yet that is what you do actually have in your hands: Dr. Danner has compressed into one volume all the knowledge of words and learning regarding their origins to be found in an entire library of foreign language dictionaries as well as related linguistic tools for the study of English developed by historians of the language. This is an altogether singular achievement. To see the extent to which this is the case, let us follow out Dr. Danner's set of organizing principles by considering an e xampl e. Take that strange word I used in the previo us paragraph: lexicographical. Using the English to Roots index at the back of the volume, you would soon discover that the word has two roots within its structure, roots that will reveal its meaning whe n combi ned. The first is 'lex .' Once you look that up, you will learn that it derives from 'legein' in Greek, a verb that means 'to say' and by extension refers to utterances or words. But you will also learn at the entry for that root the entire range of words that use that same root, discovering in the process that the root is behind the Latin word for 'law' as well as a host of English derivatives. The second root of 'lexicographical ' is 'graph' . Having arrived by way of the index at this root, you will find that this root means 'writing' and takes it origin from 'graphein', another Greek verb. As a result, you will now see inside , so to speak, the word 'lexicographical' and understand that lexicographers are people who write about words and that the adjectival form must mean: pertaining to writing about words. I cannot overstate how important having an insight into the inner meaning of words is, for you now have a technique for decoding words even when you do not have access to a dictionary, as I do n ot when writing this on a commute r train coming home from work. Dr. Danner's book allows you not only to build up your passive English vocabulary, resulting in word recognition knowledge, but also gives you the rudiments for developing your active English vocabulary, making it possible to infer the meaning of words with whi ch you are not yet acquainted. Your knowledge can now expand and will do so exponentially as your awareness of the roots in English words and your corresponding ability to decode unfam iliar words grow apace. This is the beginning of a f ine mental linguistic library: E njoy! Timothy B. Noone Ordinary Professor Catholic University of America Acknowledgments I wish to thank Dr. Roger No\u00ebl, Chairman of the Department of Foreign Languages at Georgia College and State University, Milledgeville, Georgia. Dr. No\u00ebl is fluent in French, his native language, as well as in Latin, Greek, German, Spanish, Italian, and Walloon. His help on a previous book added finesse, especially in French. I am sincerely grateful to Dr. Timothy B. Noone, Ordinary Professor at Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C., for his writing the Foreword. He is fl uent in French, German, Greek and Latin. In fact, he actually converses in Latin with his colleagues at the university. I am also grateful to Ron Evry, who assisted me at every turn when I needed his computer expertise. This thesaurus was made more comple te by using the search engine onelook.com. For the continuous guidance and support, I want to thank Bennett Graff, editor, and Monica Savaglia, associate editor, of Rowman and Littlefield . Both of them were always ready to help and offered it graciously. No book is written in a vacuum, and I am grateful for the many fine books on Latin and Greek that I've been able to use in listing words derived from those languages. Preface The main reason for compiling this thesaurus was to provide a comprehensive list of word roots an d ex- amples across disciplines. Most of the compilations of word roots already published give fewer than 100 roots; furthermore, of the roots given, only two or three examples of words derived from the indi vidual roots are listed. In addition, some of these lists cover only a single disc ipline, for example, biology, che m- istry, literature, mathematics, music, philosophy. This thesaurus lists over 1,200 roots; in addition, it is multidisciplinary, giving virtually all the major roots of all the disciplines. In addition, it lists as examples practically every usef ul word that could be located. The follow ing paragraphs show how the the saurus is organized for maximum benefit to the user. Under the heading Element , the roots, as well as prefixes, are listed alphabetically; where the root has different forms, these are listed alphabetically underneath the basic form. In the second column, From indicates the orig i- nal language source of the root, i.e., Latin, Greek, French, German , English, Arabic, Sanskrit. Under the language source is listed the word from which the root is derived, as well as the original meaning, if it is different from the f irst one listed in the next column, Meaning . Also, in the From column, the Indo-European base and origi nal meaning are listed (see dis cussion of the prototype Indo -European la n- guage later in this preface). In the Meaning column, the most common meanings of the root are listed, along with any extended meanings of the root as used in particular disciplines. In the Examples column, the words from each root or prefix are categorized by linguistic forms, that is, the words of a family are categorized by Simple Root, Prefixed Root, Leading Root Co m- pound , Trailing Root Compound, and othe r forms as explained in succeeding paragraphs. The categories follow a paradigm, or model. First listed is Simple Root (the root itself together with basic suffixes); then, Prefixed Root (where the root being considered is preceded by a prefix, e.g., preve nt, where pre- is the prefix and vent, come, is the root). Prefixes are those elements that change the meaning of the root, and are properly prepos i- tions and adverbs in G reek or Latin. In this book, this policy has been followed; admittedly, the policy here is rather arbitrar y for the sake of consistency. Some authorities regard prefixes as those elements that come invariably at the beginning of the word, for example, auto, self; bi, two; Greek homo , same (Latin homo means hetero , different. A root is variously defined: Webster's New World Collegiate Dictionary defines a root as the fundamental el e- ment of a word or form, exclusive of affixes (pr e- fixes and suffixes) and inflectional phonetic changes (e.g., -ed of waited ; -er of prettier ). American He r- itage Dictionary defines a root as a word or word element from which other words are formed. In some cases, there are assimilations. In lingui s- tics, to assimilate , to make the same, is to change the last letter of the prefix to correspond to the first letter of the root, thus making the word easier to pronounce. For example, the word assimilate itself is an assimilated form. The prefix as- is an assimil a- tion of ad-, to, toward, as in address, adjective, a d- ministration . In other cases, assimilations change the last letter of the prefix to a letter that is not the same as the first letter of the root, but to a letter that makes the word simply easier to pronounce, for e x- ample, agnomen, ascend . In this case, the change is more properly called a variation . The n ext category in the paradigm is Leading Root Compound , where the root under consider a- tion comes at the beginning of a word comprised of at least two roots, e.g., if the root under consider a- tion is cunei, wedge, cuneiform is listed as Leading Root Compound , with cunei leading the co m- pound, followed by form , form, shape; thus, cune i- form means in the shape of a wedge. Where there are different forms of the root, they are listed sep a- rately and are referenced to the original root . The next category is Trailing Root Compound , where the root under consideration comes after a n- other root, thus most likely at the end of the word , but sometimes in the middle of the word . Depending on the family, there may be additio n- al categories. One is Disguised Root , indicating th at the spelling of the root changed through centuries of use in local es apart from Greece and Rome. Alt- hough many words from Latin have remained intact or with slight modifications, many have been altered considerably as they passed into English through one of the Romance languages, in particular, xiv French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish ; for exa m- ple, English lettuce comes from Latin lactis , milk, and so called from its milky juice. Romanian, Cat a- lan, and Proven\u00e7al are also Romance languages, but their impa ct on English is minimal. Roots originally Greek were often modified as they passed into La t- in, when Rome conquered Greece before the time of Christ. In each of these categories, the element not under consideration as well as its mea ning is listed in p a- rentheses. For example, under the family ped, child , pediatric is listed as Leading Root Compound ; conse quently, iatric trails or follows ped. Therefore, after the entry pediatric, pediatrics, pediatrician , (iatr, healing) is listed after the entry. Only in cases where the root's meaning is obvi ous was the mea n- ing not given. Different forms of the same word within a list are indicated by {curly brackets}. Not all dictionaries agree on derivative words; some di c- tionaries indicate those words placed within curl y brackets as entries themselves. In many examples, Synonyms of particular words are given. Where two or more sets of syn o- nyms are applicable for the same word, these sets are numbered and separated with a semicolon, for example, 1); 2). There are often se veral synonyms for a single word; however, I have limited listings in most cases to four or five items. This thesaurus does not attempt to differentiate these synonyms; that has been left to lexicographers, the makers and compi l- ers of dictionaries. There m ay also be indicated Doublets , where two words with different meanings and with diffe r- ent spellings were originally one word, e.g., apti- tude and attitude, cart and chart, chef and chief , and ease and adjacent. The reason for their variance is that they ent ered English through different la n- guages, or from the same language but at different stages o f that language's development. In the th e- saurus, doublets are joined by a c olon, e.g., apt i- tude:attitude. There may also be Cognates , where the element had a common origin with an eleme nt from a dif - ferent language. It should be indicated here that English is only a small part of an extremely large prehistoric language family, which comparative li n- guists have called Indo -European. Although there are no written records to document the existence of this common language, these linguists have been able to show this likelihood by comparing words with similar meanings and spellings in languages as diverse as English, French, German, Greek, Irish, Latin, Russian, Spani sh, and Sanskrit , as well as others . For example, the cognate for English brother is phrater in Greek (although Greek has a more common term for brother --adelphos, as in Adelphi, Maryland; and Philadelphia, an ancient city in Ly d- ia, as well as Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , and seve r- al other , in French. The reader is advised to consult an encyclopedia or Internet article on Indo -European languages. In addition, Webster's New World does an excellent job of cross -referencing roots of the Indo-European family; American Heritage includes a treasury of Indo -European bases in its Appendix. In many cases, Place Names have been included, e.g., there is Deovolente, Mississippi, listed under Deo, God, and vol, willing. Deovolente means \"God willing \"; one can only sur mise the reasons for the name. Under cur, run, the reader will find Bon Secour, Alabama. Secour means literally \"to run under, \" but actually means \"help\"; thus, Bon Secour is translated \"Good help. \" Smackover, Arkansas, was named by the early French explorers sumac covrir , covered with sumac. Dozens of other towns in the United States have names der ived ultimately from Latin, from one of the Romance languages or from Greek. In Alabama, there is a village called Onycha, Greek for \"fingernail \"; also in Alabama, there is Greek Demopolis, literally People City. In both Illinois and Missouri, there is Cre ve-Coeur, French for broken heart, but extended to mean \"u t- ter discouragement.\" (Other reasons have been gi v- en for the name.) In Texas, there is Corpus Chri sti, Latin for Body of Christ. In Ohio, there is Penins u- la, \"almost an island \"; and in Maine, there is Presque Isle, French for \"almost an island. \" One of the most interesting place names is Uncertain, in Texas. The reasons for these inland towns being so called are both interesting and colorful. In some word families, there are also Latin Phrases, Latin Legal Phrases, Italian Music Terms, Greek Mythology, Ro man Mythology, Constell a- tions. There may be additional categories, peculiar to the particular word family; the reader will exper i- ence no difficulty in seeing the relationship of these categories. In w ord families where a single word is used in more than one discipline, the word is listed in ALL CAPS and is designated INTERDISCIPLINARY , under which the word's meanings in the different disciplines are given. This feature should prove e s- xv pecially beneficia l to teachers in showing how words are used in dis ciplines other than their own. Teachers are encouraged to help their stu dents see these relationships. It should be noted that only e x- ample words are given; there are many other words used across discipline s besides those so indicated. The use of NB, from Latin nota bene , note well, indicates that the word listed, though spelled the same or similar to the root under consideration, does not belong in the family. For example, diamond , though beginning with the letters dia, is not derived from the Greek prefix dia-, across, through. In cases where another root or roots have the same or a similar meaning, these are listed under Cross Reference . For example, Greek thes, to place, put, is cross -referenced to pon, pos, theca . There are also Root Notes in cases where the mea n- ing of the root is different from the original mea n- ing, or where there are interes ting aspects to the background. For example, aniso is considered a root itself; however , aniso combines the prefix an-, not + iso, same. Consequently, the meaning of aniso is \"not the same, \" and can be found in anisogamete, anisomerous, anisotropic . In many cases, I have given a short definition of the word or explanatory notes. These defini tions and notes are giv en for one of several reasons: to diffe r- entiate a particular word from a similar word; to give backgrounds of interesting words; or to break the simple listing of wo rds. These definitions and explanatory notes should not be construed as co m- prehensive, but simply as notes of differentiations or as pointers to understanding. In no way does the thesaurus obviate the use of a dictionary; the thesa u- rus is a companion to a dictionary. It should be stressed that this thesaurus is d e- signed fo r a user to refer to when an unknown word of mainly Latin o r Greek origin is encountered. By seeing other words in the same family, the user can better associate, and therefore, better rem ember the meaning of the root. Psychologists have shown that when on e associates an unfamiliar word with a f a- miliar one, the learning is more permanent. In the case of words comprised of two or more elements, users are encouraged to formulate their own definitions. To solidify the learning process, users should see if their definitions appear to fit the context of these particular words as the words are used in their textbooks or in their professional rea d- ing. Users may also wish to consult a dictionary to see how closely their own definitions match those of the dictio nary. For some of the polysyllabic words, readers will find it necessary to consult an un a- bridged dictionary, such as Webster's Third New International . In other cases, readers will need to consult a medical, music, or law dictionary, or po s- sibly some other specialized dictionary. References consulted in compiling this thesaurus are liste d at the end of the book under Works Consulted . Users are encouraged to write additional words in the blank space to th e left of the word categories. The blank space can al so be used for recording one's own definitions or for notes on particular words. The thesaurus concludes with a useful feature : the English to Roots Index . The Index lists each of the maj or meanings of a root and refer ences them to the root in the thesauru s. For example, good is ref- erenced to bene (Latin), bon (Latin), eu (Greek), prob (Latin); water is referenced to aqua (Latin), hyd (Greek), lacu (Latin), and limn (Latin). The a d- vantage of this feature is that one can see the major word elements that prod uce a single concept in En g- lish. Users a re encouraged to let me know of add i- tional words that can be listed in subsequ ent ed i- tions of the thesaurus.
