CONNECT WITH US ONA MESSAGE FROM LEADERSHIP @MonmouthMedicalCenter @RWJBarnabas RWJBarnabas Health @MonmouthMedicalCOVID-19 brought with it a prolonged period of uncertainty and fear, as well as the continual need to find new ways to cope. These days, however, we're experiencing another, more welcome, feeling: optimism. Thanks to the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines and the massive effort we and others have made to administer them, we're seeing real progress in containing the pandemic. At RWJBH, we always strive to be proactive, positive and energetic in our response to issues and events. We acknowledge that disparities in healthcare for Black and brown communities exist, and we're making every possible effort to address this issue throughout our entire organization. We've developed a far-reaching initiative, Ending Racism Together, to ensure that our organization is anti-racist in everything we do. Throughout all the challenges of this pandemic, Monmouth Medical Center's healthcare heroes continued our core mission of providing the highest-quality, safest care to our patients. Whatever the test, our amazing staff persevered with compassion, professionalism, dedication and teamwork. Our COVID-19 journey is a testament to the talent and dedication that our caregivers bring to their roles each and every day. Additionally, within and outside our hospital walls, we are embracing the Ending Racism Together mission to create racial, ethnic and cultural equity, as our Community Health and Social Impact departments work to encourage action through health education, prioritizing those communities that are most disenfranchised and experience poor health, and social, economic and educational outcomes. In the end, it's the resilience and strength of our healthcare providers, staff and patients that continues to inspire us. If you've been avoiding medical appointments or treatments because of the pandemic, please don't put off getting care any longer. We're here to help you stay healthy for all the good days to come.

Not all cancers are alike, not even all cancers that afflict the same organ. That's why oncologists at Monmouth Medical Center (MMC), Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus (MMCSC) and Community Medical Center (CMC) now use state-of-the-art tumor profiling to personalize cancer treatment to many patients. With tumor profiling, doctors send a tissue or blood sample to a lab to be analyzed for biomarkers that may indicate what is fueling the uncontrolled cancer cell growth. Test results usually come back within a couple weeks. If results show that a particular gene is involved, for example, physicians may be able to start treatment with a drug that targets that gene. Because the approach is so tailored, doctors often refer to it as precision medicine. \"In the old days, we just gave a report saying there is a cancer,\" says Seth Cohen, MD, Regional Director of Oncology Services for the Southern Region, which encompasses all three hospitals. \"It's better to say this is a cancer, this gene is promoting this cancer, and if you use this drug for that gene, you could have a great impact on a person's life. Patients are living longer because these targeted drugs are out there.\" In addition, many precision medicine patients enjoy an improved quality of life during treatment because these therapies usually have fewer side effects than standard approaches, says Deanna Tiggs, MS, RN, AOCNS, CUSTOMIZING Seth Cohen, MD, Regional Director of Oncology Services for the Southern Region. DEANNA TIGGS, MS, RN, AOCNS CANCER CARE Healthy Together | 4 | Summer 2021 Monmouth Medical Center | RWJBH.ORG/MONMOUTH 6/3/21 9:03 AM6/3/21 9:03 AMRegional Administrative Director of Cancer Services at MMC, an advanced practice nurse who also works with the oncology program at MMCSC and has been caring for cancer patients for more than 30 years. \"I've seen a lot of changes with regard to treatment options, and with precision medicine we're moving away from the one-size-fits-all approach and instead making treatment unique to the patient,\" Tiggs says. \"It's remarkable to see the progression.\" Take lung cancer, for instance, in which tumor profiling is often done. \"The way we treat lung cancer today is not just by knowing it's a lung cancer,\" Dr. Cohen says. \"We treat lung cancer by knowing about the genetic profile of that lung cancer.\" A lung tumor may harbor various genetic mutations. Knowing which mutation is behind a patient's cancer and understanding the tumor's molecular structure lets doctors select the treatment that is known to be most effective for that particular tumor profile. REVOLUTIONARY CARE \"There are a lot of aspects of tumors that 10 years ago we weren't even looking at, but now when we look at them, we notice we could actually have a huge impact on patient care by getting the exact genetics of the disease,\" says Dr. Cohen. \"If we can find the switch that causes some of these tumors in some of our patients, we can really make a difference for their care. What I see today is just so revolutionary in terms of changing patient outcomes.\" In one of Dr. Cohen's cases, a patient who had been battling salivary gland cancer for nine years is now cancer-free thanks to tumor profiling. The patient had been undergoing radiation and chemotherapy repeatedly to tackle the cancer, which had spread to his brain and bones. When genetic testing revealed he had a PI3 kinase mutation, Dr. Cohen treated him with an oral drug that targets that mutation. \"Now this man is going fishing every day and looks great,\" Dr. Cohen says. In another case, a patient with rectal cancer underwent tumor profiling that revealed the cancer involved a HER2 mutation. Working in partnership with Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey\u2014the state's only National Cancer Institute-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center\u2014Dr. Cohen was able to enroll the patient in a clinical trial that is testing a drug that targets that mutation. Potential access to cutting-edge clinical trials at Rutgers Cancer Institute is a major benefit to cancer patients treated at Southern Region hospitals, says Dr. Cohen. \"This is the standard of care at all three hospitals,\" he says. WHEN PRECISION MEDICINE MATTERS MOST Though tumor profiling of a wide range of malignancies is now done for many of the hospitals' cancer patients, it's not warranted in all cases, Dr. Cohen explains. \"We don't do the testing on all patients all the time,\" he says. \"If a patient has an early cancer, based on the therapies we have now, we would proceed with that standard of care. So we usually reserve this testing in more advanced cases or unique cases. We order it in rare diseases that might have genes that promote them and in patients where we need other therapeutic options.\" And not every tumor that gets tested may have a genetic culprit that can be targeted with available treatments, either. But it's worth it for all cancer patients to discuss the possibility of tumor profiling with an oncologist, Dr. Cohen says. \"For eligible patients, tumor profiling leaves no stone unturned.\"RWJBarnabas Health and Southern Region hospitals, in partnership with Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey\u2014the state's only NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center\u2014provide close-to-home access to the most advanced treatment options.

Through a partnership with RWJBarnabas Health, Rutgers Cancer Institute provides comprehensive and compassionate cancer care to adults and children, including complex surgical procedures, sophisticated radiation therapy techniques, innovative clinical trials, immunotherapy and precision medicine. In May 2020, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey became the 37th member of the Caris Precision Oncology Alliance. The Alliance is a collaborative network of leading cancer centers that demonstrate a commitment to precision medicine. These centers work together to advance comprehensive cancer profiling and establish standards of care for molecular testing in oncology through conducting research studies focused on predictive and prognostic markers that advance the clinical outcomes of patients with cancer. The Caris Precision Oncology Alliance comprises 37 academic, hospital and community-based cancer institutions, including 11 NCI- Designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers.

Yet nothing could have prepared her for the actual diagnosis of lung cancer. \"I get choked up just talking about it,\" says the property manager and grandmother of 7-year-old twin boys. Fortunately, Isabel had quit smoking and participates in the Lung Cancer Screening and Lung Nodule Program at Monmouth Medical Center (MMC), which entails having regular exams that allow doctors to monitor abnormalities over time. The protocol calls for low- dose CT scans every year unless an abnormality is detected; then scans are done at intervals appropriate for close monitoring of the lesion.

TEAM TREATMENT A multidisciplinary team of highly trained medical professionals treats patients in the Thoracic Oncology Program at Monmouth Medical Center. These include: Pulmonologists. Evaluate and treat lung disease including cancers; perform diagnostic procedures such as navigational bronchoscopies and EBUS (using ultrasound for biopsies via bronchoscopy); treat lesions with cryotherapy and laser treatments via bronchoscopy. Radiologists. Perform and interpret imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans and PET scans. Interventional radiologists. Read radiologic studies and perform CT-guided needle biopsies for diagnosis of lung lesions. Thoracic surgeons. Remove malignancies or suspicious lesions. Oncologists. Direct cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and monitor patients for recurrence. Radiation oncologists. Administer radiation treatments. STATE-OF-THE-ART CARE Treatment options for lung cancer depend on the size of the lesion, lymph node involvement and whether or not the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastases). In addition to surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, potential approaches include CyberKnife treatment, which delivers high doses of targeted radiation to destroy tumors, and targeted therapies like immunotherapy. decided to tell her family the news after the holidays. \"I wanted my daughter to enjoy the holidays, and I wanted to enjoy my grandchildren,\" she says. A few weeks after a PET/CT showed no distant spread of disease, surgery was scheduled with Andrew Nguyen, MD, a thoracic surgeon at MMC and member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group who shares the Monmouth Pulmonary Consultants office located on Corbett Way in Eatontown for the convenience of patients who require surgical consultation. He removed the upper lobe of Isabel's left lung and nearby lymph nodes to appropriately stage the cancer. In the OR, Dr. Nguyen was assured the borders were clean, and the malignancy was confirmed. Pathologic studies proved the lymph nodes were clear of disease, confirming the surgery was curative and Isabel needed no further treatment. \"I opened my eyes in recovery and felt relieved when my daughter gave a thumbs-up,\" she says. \"The possibility of removing the cancer and curing her with surgery alone was a lot greater because it was discovered early,\" Dr. Nguyen says. \"Her prognosis is significantly better than it would be for somebody who has stage two, three or four lung cancer.\" The lesion was small, and Dr. Nguyen could perform the procedure using a surgical robot. This minimally invasive surgery usually leads to a shorter and less painful recovery than more invasive approaches. EARLY CATCHES SAVE LIVES Detection of lung cancer usually happens late in the game, when chances of a cure are slim. \"Often lung cancer has a bad outcome because the patient comes in at a late stage,\" says Dr. Weiner. \"If that cancer starts in the middle of a lobe somewhere, that patient may have no symptoms until it's touching some structure like the airway or causes some obstruction. But if you catch it early, you can cure patients.\" That's why MMC doctors encourage eligible people to schedule a screening. Lung cancer is not the most common type of cancer in women, but it is the number one cause of cancer- related death. \"Women coming in in their 40s, 50s and 60s are more tuned into mammograms, colonoscopies and Pap tests,\" says Dr. Weiner. \"But if you're a smoker, lung cancer screening with low-dose CTs can save your life.\" Isabel knows how fortunate she is. \"I have a sign in my kitchen that reads, 'Grateful. Thankful. Blessed,'\" she says. \"And I truly am.\" Isabel Ferrari is grateful her lung cancer was caught early and cured thanks to screening with low-dose CT scans and timely surgery.ARE YOU ELIGIBLE FOR SCREENING? The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently expanded the pool of patients who are candidates for lung cancer screening. They include adults ages 50 to 80 who have a 20-year smoking history and currently smoke or quit within the past 15 years. \"If you're in this high-risk population, it's recommended that you obtain a low-dose CT scan,\" says Andrew Nguyen, MD, a thoracic surgeon at Monmouth Medical Center and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group. Healthy Together | 6 | Summer 2021 Monmouth Medical Center | RWJBH.ORG/MONMOUTH 6/3/21 9:07 AM6/3/21 9:07 AMUntil more people get vaccinated for COVID-19, prevention and effective treatments are the next best bets against the disease. Tops on the list are monoclonal antibodies, which are being used to treat patients at Monmouth Medical Center (MMC) and Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus (MMCSC). \"This treatment essentially provides an external immune response that your body normally develops over time when you're exposed to the virus,\" says Victor Almeida, DO, Chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at MMC and MMCSC and Associate Clinical Professor of Emergency Medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. \"The goal is to reduce the amount of virus that's available to enter a cell where it can replicate.\" The hoped-for result: a milder case of the disease and a lower risk of hospitalization. COMBINATION THERAPY First introduced in November 2020, monoclonal antibody treatment is becoming more widely available. The FDA recently updated its emergency use authorization for the treatment, recommending specific combinations of the available agents. New research suggests that two monoclonal antibodies are better than one at fighting COVID-19. In addition, \"The hope is that the combination will have efficacy against variants of the disease that are emerging,\" says Michelle Gardiner, PharmD, Clinical Pharmacist, Emergency Medicine, at MMC. Monoclonal antibodies are recommended for people at high risk of a severe case of COVID and hospitalization. These include people age 65 and older and people over age 55 who have a body mass index greater than 35, underlying cardiovascular disease, hypertension or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other respiratory disorders. \"It can be hard to predict who will go on to have severe illness,\" Dr. Gardiner says. \"These are patients known to be at a higher risk at baseline.\" Patients with mild or moderate symptoms are ideal candidates. \"The earlier these treatments are administered after the onset of symptoms, it's believed, the better they are at decreasing a patient's viral load,\" says Dr. Almeida. Dr. Gardiner sees monoclonal antibodies as a game changer. \"For months, all we could provide patients was symptom management,\" she says. \"This is the first treatment that can potentially change the course of the disease.\" If you've been diagnosed with COVID-19 and would like to learn more about monoclonal antibody treatment, speak to your physician.

We have convenient locations throughout the state: Bayonne, Clifton, East Brunswick, Egg Harbor Township, Hamilton, Jersey City, Mountainside, New Brunswick, Newark, Somerset, Toms River and Warren.In May 2019, Carol Backle of Toms River noticed drooping on the left side of her son Jayson's face. After evaluation by a doctor, the athletic, high- energy 13-year-old was diagnosed with Bell's palsy, a weakness in facial muscles that's usually temporary. One day, however, Jayson experienced sudden weakness in his left leg and hand. At the local emergency department, tests revealed the reason: a tumor in his brain that was causing hemiparesis, a partial paralysis on the left side of his body. In July, Jayson had surgery to remove the tumor. The family's insurance carrier, unsure of how significant the teen's recovery would be, strongly recommended that he be admitted to a long-term care facility. \"I was not OK with that,\" Carol says. She immediately began to research other options and soon decided that an inpatient rehabilitation program at Children's Specialized Hospital (CSH) in New Brunswick offered the type of care Jayson would need. UP FOR THE TASK \"Hemiparesis can be very frustrating, especially for someone of Jayson's age and high activity level,\" says Zack Gubitosi, DPT, CSCS, a pediatric physical therapist at CSH. \"I could tell this was a scary experience for him and his family, and I wanted them to be as comfortable as possible from day one.\" Gubitosi incorporated elements of the sports and games Jayson loves into their sessions. \"He would have me balance on one leg while we played Uno. We would play catch,\" says Jayson. \"It was awesome!\" \"Jayson was always so motivated to get better,\" Gubitosi says. \"There were understandably some difficult days, and those were the days I would challenge him to fight harder. He was always up for the task.\" After seven weeks of inpatient care, Jayson was able to go home. He continues to receive occupational therapy as an outpatient at the CSH Toms River location, working on fine motor skills. He's able to enjoy his former activities, such as going to the gym, playing video games and hanging out with friends. He's also involved in the Youth Advisory Council at CSH, which meets once a month to discuss ways to create the best possible experience for patients. \"We're just so grateful for the care that Jayson was given,\" Carol says. \"We know this whole experience could have been so much worse if we had not chosen to go where we did.\" With the wisdom of experience, Jayson offers advice for anyone who is on their own recovery path. \"Don't dwell on any of your bad thoughts,\" he says. \"Think about all the good that is happening, even the littlest progression in recovery. Focus on that!\" For more information about Children's Specialized Hospital, call 888.244.5373 or visit www.rwjbh.org/childrensspecialized.A DETERMINED YOUNG ATHLETE BATTLES BACK FROM PARTIAL PARALYSIS.'FOCUS ON THE GOOD' An RWJBarnabas Health facilit y From left, Jayson at CSH with his sister, Samantha; on the mend; and with his parents Frank and Carol at his 8th grade graduation. Healthy Together | PB | Spring 2021 RWJBarnabas Health | AM6/3/21 11:47 AMRacism has been described as a public health crisis. What does that mean? [BARRY OSTROWSKY] We start with the proposition that there is structural racism in our society. The data show that whether you're talking about food insecurity, housing, education, employment or financial and economic development, the majority of people who aren't doing well are people of color, particularly Black people. When it comes ENDING RACISM TOGETHER RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH), the largest academic healthcare system in New Jersey, is addressing equity and systemic racism and promoting an anti- racist culture throughout the organization and the communities it serves. Here, Barry Ostrowsky, President and Chief Executive Officer of RWJBH, and DeAnna Minus-Vincent, Chief Social Integration and Health Equity Strategist, explain what the system's Ending Racism Together initiative entails.to healthcare, disparities of outcome for people of color, and particularly Black people, are deeply harmful. That is not a political statement. It is a data-driven statement. [DEANNA MINUS-VINCENT] Research shows that 80 to 90 percent of health outcomes are a result of social determinants of health\u2014the conditions in which a person lives, works and plays. That's important, because race itself has RWJBARNABAS HEALTH IS ON A JOURNEY TO CREATE TRUE EQUITY IN HEALTHCARE. Healthy Together | 10 | Summer 2021 RWJBarnabas Health | found to be a social determinant. When we look at the data, even when all other things are equal, people of color, in particular Black people, still have poor health outcomes. What are some examples of how racism plays out in healthcare? [DEANNA MINUS-VINCENT] Statistics show that even Black women with more education and more income tend to lose their babies more often than white women who have less income and less education. This is due to the chronic stressors of being Black in America and what chronic stress does to our bodies. It creates a fight-or-flight syndrome at all times. Therefore, we're more susceptible to losing our babies and to chronic diseases. Countless research studies show that pain levels expressed by Black people are not believed, and so prescription pain medicines are not given in the same amount. Even Black children with fractures aren't given the same level of medication as white children. When a Black person goes into an emergency department, people assume we are substance abusers. I remember going to an ED with an asthma attack and the nurse saying, \"Do you have any clean veins?\" I work in healthcare and so I was able to navigate the system and march upstairs and talk to the CEO. But I shouldn't have to do that, and neither should anyone else. What is the role of a healthcare system in combating racism? [BARRY OSTROWSKY] We realize that when we construct healthcare delivery mechanisms, we have to consider the ability of everybody to access them. It's not equitable to simply say, \"Anyone can walk into our clinic between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.\" Many people, particularly Black people in urban communities, can't take time off for a healthcare visit during those hours. From an operational standpoint, we're reviewing key policies and procedures such as the refusal of care policy. We've conducted Listening Tours to afford employees at all levels of the organization the opportunity to provide input, and we held focus groups in April and May so that employees could have a say in the strategic planning process. [DEANNA MINUS-VINCENT] We hold monthly educational sessions for employees, called \"Equitable Encounters: Real Talk About Race,\" where issues of racism are discussed. Training is forthcoming for all employees. We're also thinking about how to serve people in the way they want to be served. For example, historically, if someone has a need, we send an outreach worker to their house. But if you work two jobs and only have a few hours with your kids, maybe you don't want outreach workers coming to the house. Maybe you'd prefer email or phone-based support. If you do need an outreach worker for complex problems, how do we coordinate services with our community partners so you can have just one outreach worker, instead of several? In addition to the practices you mention, how will a patient at an RWJBH facility become aware of the anti-racism initiative? [BARRY OSTROWSKY] When patients come to our facilities, they'll see posters and messages on video screens, and will experience an environment of respect. When we admit patients, we'll make the point that we're an anti- racist organization and if they have any experience that's inconsistent with that, please tell us. The journey to end racism requires everybody's effort and commitment. We know that we can't send out a memo saying, \"We're anti-racist, and by the end of the year there'll be no racism.\" We invite patients and all our employees to speak up and engage as we make more progress toward becoming an anti-racist organization.WHAT IS A MICROAGGRESSION? As part of Ending Racism Together, RWJBarnabas Health conducts regular trainings and other educational events for its employees. A recent session focused on the topic of microaggressions. What is a microaggression? Microaggressions are the everyday verbal and nonverbal slights and indignities that members of marginalized groups experience in their day-to-day interactions. Often, individuals who engage in microaggressions are unaware that they have said something offensive or demeaning. The accumulated experience of receiving microaggressions can lead to depression, anxiety and effects on physical health. What are some examples? Mispronouncing a person's name even after he or she has corrected you. Asking an Asian American where she's \"really\" from. Clutching your purse or wallet when a Black or Latino man approaches. Assuming a person of color is a service worker. How can a person avoid committing a microaggression? Think before you speak. Reflect on whether your brain is \"stuck\" on the racial or other differences between you and another person. If confronted on a microaggression, try not to be defensive and to understand the other person's point of view.

BARRY OSTROWSKY DEANNA MINUS-VINCENT REFUSAL OF CARE POLICY RWJBarnabas Health will not accommodate requests for or refusal by a patient for the services of RWJBH workforce members based on a personal characteristic, such as race or ethnicity, except in the limited situation where the patient (or other individual on the patient's behalf) requests that an accommodation based on gender only is necessary to protect a patient's religious or cultural beliefs.

Why is it so important for cardiovascular patients to get the vaccine? \"People with cardiovascular disease are more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19,\" Dr. Sengupta explains. \"That's because it causes a state of inflammation to the inner lining of blood vessels, leading to a greater likelihood of abnormal heart rhythm, blood clots and heart attacks. Clinical studies have shown that COVID-19 patients with cardiac conditions have a higher risk of needing to be put on a ventilator. Vaccination protects people from these severe effects.\" What kind of side effects can be expected? \"Normally, people may or may not get a tiny bruise and short-term pain at the site of the shot,\" Dr. Sengupta says. \"If you're on a blood thinner, you may get a bigger bruise. Normal side effects, especially after a second dose, may include tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever or nausea. Some people have had allergic reactions to the vaccine, but those are extremely rare.\" After a person is fully vaccinated, can he or she resume normal activities? \"Clinical trials have shown 90 to 95 percent protection, but there's a possibility that some people may develop COVID-19 even after being vaccinated; the infection runs a milder course,\" Dr. Sengupta says. \"The CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines on masking are evolving. However, patients may still choose to be additionally cautious and wear a mask and practice social distancing, as we wait to see the impact and evolution of the most recent CDC guidelines.\" What else should cardiovascular patients do to protect themselves? \"Get outdoors and exercise\u2014walk, bike, experience nature,\" says Dr. Sengupta. \"The pandemic has made a lot of people very fearful of any outdoor experience. At least 50 percent of my patients have given up any form of activity. The result is that they gain weight, become deconditioned, and conditions like hypertension and blood pressure become uncontrolled. \"I advise patients to avoid crowds and clusters of people, but not to avoid being physically active. Try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise on most days. All of this will help you feel better and build your resilience.\" If you've been skipping physician visits, as many have during the pandemic, be sure to get back in a regular routine as soon as you can, Dr. Sengupta advises. \"People have put off procedures and elective interventions and even allowed their symptoms to worsen for fear of going out during the pandemic,\" he says. \"This is your chance to resume your relationship with your doctor and get back on track. \"In fact, you may find that you can do many routine checkups remotely, thanks to all the progress taking place with telehealth and remote monitoring devices,\" he says. \"The pandemic has sparked a lot of innovation, which is allowing people to get care while still in their homes, and that trend is going to continue.\"RWJBARNABAS HEALTH: YOUR HEART-HEALTH DESTINATION Whether you're in need of care for high blood pressure, require heart surgery or are interested in ways to help keep your heart healthy, RWJBarnabas Health's heart, vascular and thoracic care programs are here for you.

A wide range of treatment options for both adult and pediatric patients is available at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston and at satellite locations throughout New Jersey. Here are just two examples of patients whose lives have been transformed through our world-class care and the generosity of organ donors. BACK IN ACTION AFTER A DOUBLE TRANSPLANT RONALD PELLETIER, MD Dillon Devlin, 29, had Type 1 diabetes, but that didn't stop him from traveling the country with a friend between 2014 and 2018. They hit 38 states, ending up in California for a while before coming home to New Jersey. Along the way, Dillon went to pharmacies to get his insulin prescription refilled, but his increasingly high blood pressure was never addressed. By the time he got back to his home state and met with an endocrinologist and a nephrologist, he was shocked to learn that he was in stage 4 kidney failure and would need both a kidney transplant and a pancreas transplant. \"Kidney failure alone is an older person's disease. A kidney and pancreas transplant is more typically needed in a younger person who has Type 1 diabetes,\" explains Ronald Pelletier, MD, Director of Transplantation at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick. \"That's because the pancreas is not making enough insulin, a hormone that controls the blood sugar level in the body.\" THE WAIT BEGINS Dillon went from working at an auto salvage business, hoisting transmissions onto pallets, to needing three- times-weekly dialysis. For eight months, he awaited a suitable kidney and pancreas for transplant. Six different possibilities fell through, one as he was actually being prepared for surgery. Finally, in November 2020, Dr. Pelletier successfully transplanted a new kidney and pancreas. \"All of a sudden I was waking up from surgery and my mom was saying, 'You did it!'\" he recalls. \"I was standing up within six hours and out of the hospital in six days.\" A subsequent period of rest and recovery synced up well with the pandemic-related lockdown. Now he's back to lifting weights and going for hikes, and is actively seeking to get back into the workforce. \"It's so strange to wrap my head around not having to take insulin,\" he says. \"Modern medicine is a complete marvel.\" \"What I really love about kidney and pancreas transplantation is that you get to transform someone's life,\" Dr. Pelletier says. \"Not only do they not need dialysis afterward, they're no longer diabetic! That's fantastic.\" Dillon's advice to others awaiting transplant: \"Don't let hopelessness consume you. It can happen anytime. The seventh time I got a call, it was a miracle match.\" Healthy Together | 14 | Summer 2021 RWJBarnabas Health LIFE-CHANGING IMPACT OF A KIDNEY TRANSPLANT During a transplant, the new kidney is placed in the lower abdomen. Timothy Collins, 60, of Westfield, was diagnosed in 1996 with polycystic kidney disease (PKD), which causes kidneys to enlarge and lose function over time. \"PKD is hereditary,\" he explains. \"My father had it, my grandmother had it and my brother has it.\" In 1998, Timothy got a kidney transplant from his younger sister. The kidney functioned well for almost 18 years, but in 2016 an infection caused his body to become severely dehydrated. Timothy needed to be on hemodialysis\u2014in which blood is pumped out of the body, filtered through an artificial kidney machine and returned\u2014three days a week for two months. After that, he had a catheter placed in his stomach so he could do at-home peritoneal dialysis, which uses the lining inside the belly as a natural filter. He did this nightly for 16 months. \"Even though you're on dialysis, it's not like having a kidney,\" Timothy says. \"There's still poison in your body and you have a yellow look. I gained weight and my creatinine levels [a measure of kidney function] were way too high.\" MEDICAL ADVANCES \"We're so fortunate that in kidney failure, there's the option of dialysis,\" says Francis Weng, MD, Chief of the Renal and Pancreas Transplant Division at Saint Barnabas Medical Center (SBMC). \"It keeps people alive. However, dialysis doesn't replace the full function of the kidney. For most patients, the better option is a kidney transplant.\" Timothy's niece, who was 21 at the time, offered to donate a kidney to him. At Timothy's insistence, they waited until she graduated from business school and law school, which she was attending simultaneously, in May 2018. Though her kidney wasn't a match for Timothy, she became part of the kidney transplant chain at SBMC: She donated to someone for whom her kidney was compatible, and Timothy was given a kidney from another donor. \"Living donor programs like the one Timothy was in are one of the significant advances in kidney transplantation that we've seen over the past 15 years,\" says Dr. Weng. \"We also have many more choices in the kind of medications we use to prevent rejection of the transplant and minimize side effects. The vast majority of patients do quite well after transplantation.\" \"It's a wonderful thing,\" says Timothy. \"I have so much more energy now, and I have so much more time to myself since I don't have to plan my days around getting to a machine at a certain time. I've been able to be the project manager on several commercial renovation projects, and that was the best therapy ever. I love life, and I've been very blessed.\" FRANCIS WENG, MD To learn more about kidney and pancreas transplantation at RWJBarnabas Health, visit www.rwjbh.org/kidneytransplant. LOVING LIFE WITH A NEW KIDNEY Damaged Kidney Transplanted Kidney Bladder Healthy Together | 14 | Summer 2021 RWJBarnabas Health | AM6/3/21 11:58 AMFor decades, the cornerstones of cancer treatment were surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. In recent years, immunotherapy has risen to the forefront. \"What's remarkable about immunotherapy is the way it uses the immune system to specifically target cancer cells and not healthy cells,\" explains Christian Hinrichs, MD, Chief of the Section of Cancer Immunotherapy and Co-director of the Cancer Immunology and Metabolism Center of Excellence at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey. Dr. Hinrichs, a world-class expert in cancer immunology and immunotherapy, was recruited from the National Institutes of Health to co-direct the center with Eileen White, PhD, Deputy Director and Chief Scientific Officer at Rutgers Cancer Institute. \"Immunotherapy has been a real game-changer for systemic cancer therapy for two reasons,\" Dr. Hinrichs says. \"First, it creates a very strong attack against cancer. Second, it has remarkably few negative side effects.\" However, some cancers respond well to immunotherapies, but others don't respond at all. Why? To answer that question, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey established the new Center of Excellence. The $50 million effort, fueled by an anonymous gift of $25 million, is poised to lead the immunotherapy revolution and transform cancer treatment. \"We are putting into place key expertise and facilities for 'first in human' clinical trials in immunotherapy and cell therapy,\" Dr. Hinrichs explains.The program is also serving a large and diverse patient population in New Jersey, Dr. Hinrichs notes. \"That's so important in cancer research,\" he says. NEW CONNECTIONS The Center of Excellence takes a novel approach by uniting its strengths in cancer immunology and metabolism under one umbrella. \"Few, if any, institutions have this capability,\" says Dr. White, Co-director of the center. Dr. White is a globally recognized expert in the study of metabolism\u2014the way cells grow by using energy and nutrients for sustenance\u2014 and how it contributes to cancer. \"By focusing our efforts on determining how tumor metabolism drives growth and suppresses the immune response, we can begin to develop new immunotherapies and make existing immunotherapies more effective,\" she says. The center is also focusing on the development of new cellular therapies for common types of cancer, a particular area of expertise for Dr. Hinrichs. \"We are focused on the discovery and development of new T cell [immune system cell] therapies, particularly gene- engineering approaches that allow T cells to specifically and powerfully target tumors,\" he says. These new therapies are made in a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) facility, which follows stringent FDA regulations to ensure the quality of the manufactured therapies. \"A GMP facility is absolutely critical for what we do,\" says Dr. Hinrichs. \"It enables us to produce personalized cell therapy products for each patient right here. We can actually discover and develop new cancer therapies at Rutgers Cancer Institute that no one can do anywhere else.\" Many of these new therapies will be available to patients at Rutgers Cancer Institute and throughout the RWJBarnabas Health system.Eileen White, PhD (left), and Christian Hinrichs, MD, Co-directors of the Cancer Immunology and Metabolism Center of Excellence, a groundbreaking collaboration with a mission to develop new immunotherapies To learn more about the Cancer Immunology and Metabolism Center of Excellence, visit https://cinj.org/immunology-metabolism.

In April, Monmouth Medical Center (MMC) and Children's Specialized Hospital (CSH), both RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) facilities, hosted a beam signing on what was lifted into place on April 12 as the structure's ceremonial final beam. It was another step toward completion\u2014 slated for October\u2014of the new 82,000-square-foot medical and wellness facility. The location will provide the region with convenient access to comprehensive women's services, pediatric services, wellness education and resources, a blood drawing station and an urgent care center. MMC will offer pediatric subspecialty practices, including cardiology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, surgery and urology, pulmonology and infectious diseases. CSH will provide both medical and therapy services, including developmental and behavioral services, psychiatry, neurology and physiatry. Therapy services will include audiology, speech language, occupational, physical and psychology. In addition, the facility will feature comprehensive women's services, including maternal/fetal medicine physician offices, a urogynecological practice, a lactation center and MMC's pioneering Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders Center. PARTNERS IN CARE The new site adjacent to Boscov's department store will further MMC's mission to become more accessible to residents across Monmouth County and extend its trusted, high-quality health care programs and services. It also advances MMC's commitment to develop a comprehensive care delivery system in Monmouth County that meets healthcare needs through community partnerships and access to the vast resources of the RWJBarnabas Health system. \"We have served Monmouth County for more than 130 years and are driving progress through partnership as we work with our communities to transform care for our community,\" said Eric Carney, President and CEO of MMC. \"Healthcare continues to evolve, and RWJBarnabas Health and Monmouth Medical Center are at the forefront of this transformation in our communities, and by connecting the trusted pediatric and women's services of Monmouth Medical Center with the outstanding offerings of Children's Specialized Hospital, patients needing expert care will have access to treatments right in their own backyard.\" \"Children's Specialized Hospital's vision is a world where all children can reach their full potential\u2014to make that vision a reality we need to continually enhance access to care,\" said Warren E. Moore, FACHE, President and CEO, Children's Specialized Hospital, and Senior Vice President, Children's Services, RWJBarnabas Health. \"By collaborating with Monmouth Medical Center, we are able to bring our many innovative programs and services to patients and families living with special healthcare needs in Monmouth County. This new site will give us the ability to schedule more outpatient appointments, and because of its proximity to major highways and bus routes, we'll be easily accessible to any patients and families who need us.\" Other features and amenities will include a wellness center dedicated to community health, a central registration area on each floor, ample parking and clinical spaces designed for flexibility and growth.

To connect with one of NJ's top cardiovascular specialists, call 888.724.7123 or visit www.rwjbh.org/heart. By now, you've probably heard that COVID-19 can wreak havoc on the heart. In a recent study published in the European Heart Journal, researchers found that about half of patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 developed cardiac problems, including inflammation and heart disease. To get a full picture of the virus's impact on a person's heart, doctors perform a cardiac MRI. At Monmouth Medical Center (MMC), the MRI equipment was recently upgraded so these evaluations can be conducted. \"A cardiac MRI is the gold standard for assessing the structure and function of the heart,\" says Ajay Shah, MD, Director of Cardiac Rehabilitation at MMC and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group. A cardiac MRI enables doctors to assess blood flow, the heart's valves and the presence of inflammation. Doctors can use the test to diagnose heart disease, aneurysm and cardiomyopathy, in which the heart has trouble pumping blood to the body. COVID-19 infection can lead to cardiomyopathy as well as myocarditis, or inflammation of the lining of the heart. The virus can also cause scarring, weakness and problems with the heart's electrical system. \"An MRI helps us determine a patient's prognosis and treatment,\" says Dr. Shah. \"In some cases, a person needs to be monitored. An MRI doesn't expose a patient to radiation, so monitoring is safe.\" QUICK RESULTS A cardiac MRI takes about 45 minutes to an hour, and the results are usually available the same day or within 24 hours. The test is most often covered by insurance. \"The technology has been around for a while, but it's not available everywhere,\" says Dr. Shah. \"It's a large investment.\" One measure of the test's value: Members of the Rutgers football team who experienced COVID-19 will be evaluated with cardiac MRI. \"They need the test to be cleared to play,\" says Dr. Shah. If you've had COVID-19 and continue to experience symptoms, such as chest pain, palpitations and difficulty breathing, ask your doctor whether you could benefit from a cardiac MRI. \"It's the best test we have for patients,\" says Dr. Shah. A STATE-OF-THE-ART IMAGING TEST CAN HELP DOCTORS DIAGNOSE AND MONITOR CARDIAC PROBLEMS.IS YOUR HEART HEALTHY?Upgraded MRI equipment allows Ajay Shah, MD (seated), and MRI supervisor Nicolas DeMonte, RT, to better assess the heart. Healthy Together | PB | Summer 2021 Monmouth Medical Center | RWJBH.ORG/MONMOUTH 6/3/21 9:18 AM6/3/21 9:18 DELAYS PANDEMIC CAUSE CONCERN. breast that \"scared the daylights out of me,\" recalls the Belford woman, now 43. Follow-up ultrasound imaging indicated the mass was benign, but Carolyn was determined never again to push off her mammogram. Her 2020 screening happened just as the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, yet Carolyn kept her appointment even as many women across the United States who were fearful of catching the virus delayed theirs. Research indicates that cancer screening tests, including those for breast cancer, plunged sharply after the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020, with numbers falling far below historical norms. Whether breast cancer screenings are put off due to the pandemic or other reasons, delays can pose serious health consequences, says Alexander King, MD, Regional Director of Breast Radiology for RWJ Barnabas Health Southern Region, which encompasses Monmouth Medical Center, Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus and Community Medical Center. \"We know that the longer patients go between screening mammograms, As a nurse practitioner at Monmouth Medical Center, Carolyn Boyle likes to stay on top of her own healthcare, especially yearly screening mammograms. She learned how much stress even a slight delay can cause. Carolyn went for her 2019 mammogram two months later than usual, and the test revealed a small lump in her right BREAST HEALTH: BACK ON TRACK ALEXANDER KING, MD Healthy Together | 20 | Summer 2021 Monmouth Medical Center | RWJBH.ORG/MONMOUTH 6/3/21 9:20 are to find late- stage breast cancer,\" Dr. King explains. \"Cancers we find through screening are commonly very small and found at an earlier stage.\" Cancers that are detected early offer the best opportunities for treatment. \"Breast cancers that are found by patients themselves are typically larger and may have already spread by the time women seek care,\" he adds. \"That's the whole purpose of screening\u2014to find the cancer before you feel it.\" REACHING OUT About 22,000 screening mammograms were performed across RWJ Barnabas Health Southern Region in 2020. But the pandemic did force a six-week pause in screening mammograms, with patients brought in as needed if they experienced possible breast cancer symptoms such as a lump or nipple discharge, Dr. King says. By early May 2020, mammogram facilities in the Southern Region were rescheduling screening mammograms and spacing out patient appointments to minimize exposure to the coronavirus. Other hygiene measures also were put into place, including masks, sanitizing and temperature checks. \"We worked at 110 percent until the end of 2020 trying to get in people who missed screenings in March and April,\" Dr. King says. \"Even now that we're past the one-year mark of the pandemic's start, there are still a significant number of our patients who haven't had a mammogram since 2019. We're reaching out individually to remind them and reinforce that they shouldn't put it off any longer.\" While recommendations for screening mammography vary by group, there's general agreement that for average-risk women, annual screening mammography beginning at age 40 will save the most lives. VACCINE CONSIDERATIONS With COVID-19 vaccinations well under way, confusion surrounds false-positive mammograms among some women who recently got a shot. Vaccines of any type, not just for COVID, can enlarge lymph nodes under the arm, leading to suspicious findings on breast images, Dr. King says. \"We've certainly seen women who were vaccinated within a couple of weeks before their mammogram have swollen lymph nodes in the armpit, but this reaction is not the norm,\" Dr. King says. \"And the appearance of lymph nodes that swell after vaccination is different from those due to breast cancer.\" Repeat imaging may be done in three months to confirm all is well, he says. Women undergoing any type of breast imaging are asked if they've recently been vaccinated and if so, which arm. \"We put that in the chart so when doctors interpret the images, they'll have that information,\" Dr. King says. \"But it's certainly no reason to push off your mammogram or your COVID vaccine.\" Carolyn Boyle became more dedicated than ever to getting regular mammograms when a suspicious lump turned up after a short delay in her screening schedule.NEW HEALTH CONNECT APP STREAMLINES APPOINTMENTS You can check the weather or order lunch using apps on your cell phone\u2014so why not schedule your healthcare appointments that way, too? The new RWJBarnabas Health Connect app lets you do just that. Launched in March 2020, Health Connect enables patients to book appointments for both doctor visits and diagnostic tests. Users create and save a profile that includes insurance information and referrals, and appointments are added directly to your phone's calendar. \"Many people are comfortable pulling out their phones and scheduling a dinner reservation or a haircut, so now they can avoid a phone call and schedule health appointments,\" says Alexander King, MD, Regional Director of Breast Radiology for RWJ Barnabas Health Southern Region. \"It's a convenience to patients and a much quicker process as well.\" Patients who use the app seem pleased with how well it works. \"They say it's easy to use,\" Dr. King says.

The Community Health and Social Impact & Community Investment team at Monmouth Medical Center (MMC) is raising awareness of COVID-19 prevention and addressing the needs of area children. Here are a few of its recent initiatives: WALKING FOR WELLNESS The Community Health team collaborated with the City of Long Branch Recreation Department to form a walking club to promote health and wellness. The one-mile walks, which took place on the Long Branch Boardwalk, were held weekly from March through April. (They were also held weekly in the fall of 2020.) Clinicians from MMC joined the groups and gave 10-minute talks. They included a nurse who spoke about emergency services, a physician who talked about the COVID-19 vaccine, a stroke program coordinator who spoke about heart health and the director of the Comprehensive Sleep Medicine Center. The program was a success, says Jean McKinney, Regional Director, Community Health and Social Impact & Community Investment. \"Walking with others can turn exercise into an enjoyable social occasion and keep you motivated,\" she says. ADDRESSING VACCINE HESITANCY IN OUR COMMUNITY The Community Health and Social Impact & Community Investment and Diversity and Inclusion departments held a series of virtual programs to address the issue of vaccine hesitancy, particularly among minority communities. Panelists included physicians, pharmacists and nurses who discussed and answered questions on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine and the importance for the community to be vaccinated. The departments also collaborated with the City of Long Branch's Health Department in a multidimensional cross-media promotional campaign to identify trusted local \"Influencers\" targeting all residents with a focus on those living below the poverty line and the city's immigrant population. Campaign posters created in English, Spanish and Portuguese featured trusted community members along with Margaret C. Fisher, MD, Medical Director, Clinical and Academic Excellence at MMC, and Sharmine Brassington, MSN, RN, Director of Patient Care at the Emergency Department at MMC. Currently, staff members at both MMC and MMCSC are working with local organizations and food pantries serving vulnerable populations in assisting them with vaccination appointments.CAREERS IN HEALTHCARE On March 24, MMC, with Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus, held a virtual career exploration event for students in grades 5 to 12. Goals were to introduce them to a range of careers and let them know that you don't necessarily have to be a physician or a nurse to work in healthcare. The event featured a physician, an oncology nurse navigator, a director of human resources and an assistant director at the Jacqueline M. Wilentz Comprehensive Breast Center. All of the presenters shared their personal journeys and discussed what it's like to work in the field. More than 60 students from area schools attended. \"It was the first time that we held a virtual program of this kind for students,\" says Kelly DeLeon, MS, Manager of Community Health and Social Impact & Community Investment. \"The kids were completely engaged and asked thoughtful questions about the premed track, the training required to become a radiology technician and how the presenters paid for their education.\" The event was so successful that the hospital plans to host another seminar in the future.For a complete list of Community Health Education programs, visit www.rwjbh.org/Monmouth and click on the calendar of events.
