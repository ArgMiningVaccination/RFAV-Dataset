SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC) 100. LOPERAMIDE 1. The following boxed warning shall be included on the label of products containing Loperamide: 2. The following statement shall be included in the package insert of products containing Loperamide: a) WARNING b) PRECAUTION Appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy should be given to protect against dehydration in all cases of diarrhoea. Oral rehydration therapy which is the use of appropriate fluids including oral rehydration salts remains the most effective treatment for dehydration due to diarrhoea. The intake of as much of these fluids as possible is therefore imperative. Drug -induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may aggravate and mask dehydration and depletion of electrolytes. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present Loperamide should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. c) Warning s and Precautions The use of higher than the recommended doses for control of the diarrhea may cause abnormal heart rhythms and serious cardiac events leading to death. However, in adult patients receiving the recommended dosage of loperamide, cases of syncope and ventricul ar tachycardia have been reported. Some of these patients were taking other drugs or had other risk factors that may have increased their risk of cardiac adverse reactions. Abuse and misuse of loperamide, as an opioid substitute, have been described in individuals with opioid addiction (see Overdose). d) Adverse Reactions Post-marketing Experience NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER 6 YEARS OF AGE Not recommended for children under 6 years of age. Its use has been associated with fatal episodes of paralytic ileus in infants and young childr en. Cardiac Disorders: QT/QTc interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, other ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, syncope, and death (see Warnings and Precautions). e) Overdose In individuals who have intentionally ingested overdoses (reported in doses from 40 mg up to 792 mg per day) of loperamide HCl, prolongation of the QT/QTc interval, Torsades de Pointes, other ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest, have been observed (see Warnings and Precautions). Fatal cases have also been reported. 3. The following statement shall be included in the RiMUP of products containing Loperamide: a) If you use too much (overdose) If you have taken more than the recommended dose of [product name], immediately contact your doctor or go to the Emergency Department of your nearest hospital for advice. Symptoms may include : changes to your heartbeat such as increased heart rate and irregular heart rhythm (these symptoms can have potentially serious, life -threatening consequences) muscle stiffness uncoordinated movements drowsiness difficulty urinating weak breathing Reference : Directive No. 14 Year 2017.

PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (PPI) (Products containing Pantoprazole, Omeprazole, Lansoprazole, Esomeprazole, Rabeprazole, Dexlansoprazole) The following statements shall be included in the package insert and RiMUP of pharmaceutical products containing Proton Pump Inhitors (PPI): Package Insert 1. Warnings and Precautions : Regular Surveillance Patients on proton pump inhibitor treatment (particularly those treated for long term) should be kept under regular surveillance. Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE) Proton pump inhibitors cases of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE). If lesions occur, especially in sun -exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanie d by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping {product name}. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibit ors. Hypomagnesaemia Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPI like {product name} for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventr icular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take P PI with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment. Fracture Proton pump inhibitors, especially i f used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that p roton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10 -40%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care according to current clinical guidelines and they should have an adequat e intake of vitamin D and calcium. Clostridium Difficile Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Vitamin B12 Deficiency Daily treatment with any acid -suppressing medica tions over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) caused by hypo - or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid -suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 2. Undesirable hypomagnesaemia. Fracture Musculoskele tal disorders Frequency \"uncommon\": Fracture of the hip, wrist or spine. Clostridium Difficile Diarrhea Infections & infestations: Clostridium difficile (benign) Vitamin B12 Deficiency Metabolic/Nutritional: Vitamin B12 deficiency 3. Warnings & Precautions - Interference with laboratory tests Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. If the patient(s) are due to have a test on Chromogranin A level, [product name] treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements to a void this interference (see section Pharmacodynamic). If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment. 4. Pharmacodynamic During treatment with antisecretory medicinal products, serum gastrin increases in response to the decreased acid secretion. Also CgA increases due to decreased gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. Available published evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors should be discontinued between 5 days and 2 weeks prior to CgA measurements. This is to allow CgA levels that might be spuriously elevated following PPI treatment to return to refe rence range. Consumer Medication Information Leaflet (RiMUP) i.

Ref. Chromogranin A (CgA) (no. 3, 4, ii) Attachment 9 1.2 CATEGORIES OF PRODUCT 1.2.2 BIOLOGICS 1. Definition: The term 'biopharmaceutical' was coined in the 80 's to define proteins that were made by recombinant DNA technology [which includes hybridoma technology for monoclonal antibody (mAb) production]. 1.1 Biologic/ Biological product refers to a product whose active s ubstance is made by or derived from a living organism (plant, human, animal or microorganism) and may be produced by biotechnology methods and other cutting -edge technologies. This product imitates natural biological substances in our bodies such as hormon es, enzymes or antibodies. 1.2 Biological substance is defined as a substance that is produced by or extracted from a biological source and that needs, for its characterization and the determination of its quality , a combination of physicochemical -biolog ical testing together with the production process and its controls. 1.3 Biopharmaceuticals/ Biologics/ Biological products can also be defined as: \"a protein (including antibodies) or nucleic acid -based pharmaceuticals used for therapeutic, which is p roduced by means other than direct extraction from a native (non -engineered) biological source\". This corresponds to the new biotechnology view (that is, by elimination, it is largely restricted to recombinant/ genetically engineered and mAb -based products ). 1.4 The term 'Biotechnology product' and 'Biological product' are used to broadly refer to all biopharmaceuticals (by the broad biotechnology view). Note: Today, biologics have become inextricably intertwined with biopharmaceuticals, to the point where they are synonymous. The general consensus is that the term 'Biologic' and 'Biopharmaceutical' are interchangeable. Biologics include a wide range of produc ts suc h as: vaccines, blood products, monoclonal antibodies (therapeutics), recombinant prote ins (including but not limited to insulins, hormones, erythropoetins and other hematopoietic factors), cytok ines (including but to interferons, interleukins, colony -stimulating fac tors, tumour necrosis factors), cell and gene therapy products (CGTPs). But does not include: Metabolites from microorganisms; e.g. antibiotics and some hormones; by chemical synthesis; e.g. peptides/ oligo - nucleotides produced by chemical synthesis; Whole blood or cellular blood components. For details, please refer Appendix 3: Guideline on Registration of Biologics and Guideline on Regis tration for Biosimilars in Malaysia 2. For detail on regis tration of Biologics products, please refer Appendix 3: Guideline on Registration of Biologics. Note: This document is not intended to apply on the control of genetically modified live organisms designed to be used directly in humans, e.g. live vaccines 3. Unlike small -molecule generic drugs, exact copies of biologics are impossible to produce because t hese are large and highly complex molecules produced in living cells. A 'biosimilar' medicinal product (a short designation for 'similar biological medicinal product') is considered as a new biological medicinal product developed to be similar in terms of quality, safety and efficacy to an already registered, well established, medicinal product. For details, please refer to Guideline on Registration for Biosimilars in Malaysia. 4. Cell and gene therapy products (CGTPs) is regulate d as Biologic products. Unlike biotechnology products which are mostly purified proteins of cells, CGTPs contain living and functional cells. Therefore , CGTP is regulated under a separate framework. For detai ls, please refer to: Guidance Document and Guidelines For Registration of Cell and Gene Therapy Products (CGTPs). This document provides information for manufacturers, applicants, healthc are professionals and the general public on legal arrangements in Malaysia for the registration of CGTPs. The implementation of the guideline will be compulsory on 1 January 2021 as stated in the Directive No. 6 BPFK/PPP/07/25 (11) Jld.1: Direktif Untuk Menguatkuasakan Penggunaan Guidance Document And Guideline For Registration Of Cell And Gene Therapy Products (CGTPS), December 2015 Dan Good Tissue Practice Guideline, 2ND Edition, December 2015) . Attachment 10 SECTION D: INSPECTION & LICENSING Inspection and licensing of manufacturing premises or facilities, importers and wholesalers of registered products or notified cosmetics on the basis of compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) as well as Good Distribution Practice (GDP) are vital element of drug control. Compliance to GMP is a and GDP are prerequisite for the application of a manufacturing license as well as product registration or cosmetic notification whereas compliance to GDP is a prerequisite for the application of a wholesale license or import license. 12.
