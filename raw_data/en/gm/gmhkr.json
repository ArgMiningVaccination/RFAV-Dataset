Formularies are developed based on evaluations of efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of drugs. Tiered copay formula ries provide financial incentives for patients to select lower -cost drugs in commercial health plans. Since Medica id precludes tiering of copays, a preferred drug list (PDL) can be developed instead to incentivize prescribers. A PDL is a list of medications that Medicaid will cover the cost for without the need to request prior authorization (PA).1 PDLs are comprised of medi cations that either are generic formulations or are the result of price negotiations between the pharmaceutical companies and Medicaid.1 PDLs create incentives for a provider to prescrib e a drug on the PDL if possible or receive PA to do otherwise.2 Utilization management tools such as prior authorization, step therapy, and quantity limits can still be utilized with a PDL. Pros/Cons Preferred Drug List would allow manag ement of dru g classes that are currently not managed, for example allow short acting bronchodilators or insulins to be managed via PDL vs clinical PA thus moving members to the most cost effective, clinically appropriate product . Supplemental rebate negotiations vs multi -state purchasing pools Hiring rebate contractor for supplemental rebate negotiations & ongoing maintenance of contracts Using internal resources to negotiate supplemental rebates & ongoing maintenance of contracts Joining a multi- state purchasing pool, would require internal resources to manage this program and deciding which purchasing pool to join P&T session s to review financials 4 extra meetings per year for P&T Add i ndependent meetings to exi sting meetings (could entail a s ession to discuss clinical component of drug, then another session to review financials, then another session to announce decisions made in the financial review session) Grandfathering members vs moving members to preferred drugs Grandfathering members for therapy classes such as multiple sclerosis drugs and targeted immune modulator therapies; new starts to use preferred drug(s) For therapy classes such as short acting bronchodilators or insulins, move members to preferred drugs - member/p hysician /pharmacy notification sent XX days in advance Increased PA rejects for non -preferred drug s causing member disruption and increased calls to prescribers by pharmacies to switch members to preferred drugs If all therapy classes are grandfathered , there will be no savings Member/Physician/Pharmacy impact Member disruption and possible gaps in care Prescriber burden to prescribe the preferred drug for Medicaid Prescriber burden to submit PA reque sts to prescribe non-preferred drugs 17 Increased PA rejects at pharmacy point -of-sale, outbound calls to prescribers to switch to preferred drug or continue to use non- preferred drugs More a dministrative work /burden Quarterly maintenance of PDL document that will need to be updated and posted along with sending physician/pharmacy communications Therapy classes currently not managed will require UM criteria for preferred vs non -preferred status (increase in the number of PA criteria to manage) Updating existing UM criteria based on preferred vs non- preferred status Implementing and updating all system PA coding for preferred/non- preferred drug s Closed formulary or closed certain therapeutic classes to have greater leverage to obtain supplemental rebates Massachusetts submitted an application to CMS that included a provision to amend its Section 1115 Medicaid demonstration waiver to create a closed formulary2 Potential for greater supplemental rebates for closed therapy classes No clinical PA review s of non -preferred drugs in closed therapy classes Estimated PDL -Supplemental Rebate Savings 2Q2018 Estimated State Plan Cost Estimated Savings SABA $324,434.45 Atypical Antipsychotics -Glucose Co (SGLT2) $168,302.96 References: Hydery S, Mousa S.

Therapeutic Class Overview Anticonvulsants INTRODUCTION Epilepsy is a disease of the brain defined by any of the following ( Fisher et al 2014 ): At least 2 unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring > 24 hours apart; 1 unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after 2 unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Types of seizures include generaliz ed seizures , focal ( partial ) seizures , and status epilepticus (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ CDC] 2018 , Epilepsy Foundation 2016). Generalized seizures affect both sides of the brain and include: Tonic-clonic (grand mal) : begin with stiffenin g of the limbs, followed by jerking of the limbs and face Myoclonic: characterized by rapid, brief contractions of body muscles, usually on both sides of the body at the same time Atonic: characterized by abrupt loss of muscle tone; they are also called dr op attacks or akinetic seizures and can result in injury due to falls Absence (petit mal) : characterized by brief lapses of awareness, sometimes with staring, that begin and end abruptly; they are more common in children than adults and may be accompanied by brief myoclonic jerking of the eyelids or facial muscles, a loss of muscle tone, or automatisms. Focal seizures are located in just 1 area of the brain and include: Simple : affect a small part of the brain; can affect movement, sensations, and emotion, without a loss of consciousness Complex : affect a larger area of the brain than simple focal seizures and the patient loses awareness ; episodes typically be gin with a blank stare, followed by chewing movements, picking at or fumbling with clothing, mumbling, and performing repeated unorganized movements or wandering; they may also be called epilepsy\" or \"psychomotor epilepsy\" Secondar ily generalized seizures: begin in 1 part of the brain and spread to both sides Status epilepticus is characterized by prolonged, uninterrupted seizure activity . Seizure classifications from the International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) were updated in 2017. The ILAE classification of seizure types is based on whether the seizure has a foc al, generalized, or unknown onset; has a motor or non- motor onset; and whether the patient is aware or has impaired awareness during the event (for focal seizures). Additional classification details may also be used ( Fisher et al 2017A, Fisher et al 2017B ). There is variation between the ILAE classifications and many of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved indications for antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). For example, a \"focal aware\" seizure corresponds to the prior term \"simple partial seizure,\" and a \"focal impaired awareness\" seizure corresponds to the prior term \"complex partial seizure.\" A number of epilepsy syndromes have also been described; these are defined by groups of features that tend to occur together such as having a similar seizure type, age of onset, part of the brain involved, and electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern (Epilepsy Foundation 2013). An example is a childhood epilepsy syndrome called Lennox -Gastaut syndrome (LGS), which is characterized by several seizure types including tonic (stiffening) and atonic (drop) seizures. In LGS, there is a classic EEG pattern seen and intellectual development is usually impaired ( Epilepsy Foundation 2014). Epilepsy management is focused on the goals of 1) c ontrolling seizures, 2) avoiding treatment -related adverse effects (AEs), and 3) maintaining or restoring quality of life. Management options vary based on the seizure type. It is usually appropriate to refer patients to a neurologist to establish the epil epsy diagnosis and formulate the management strategy (Schachter 201 8). A correct diagnosis is essential to proper treatment selection. For example, absence seizures are commonly confused with complex partial seizures. However, drugs that reduce absence se izures are generally ineffective for complex partial seizures, and the most effective drugs for complex partial seizures may be ineffective against or even increase the frequency of absence seizures ( Epilepsy Foundation 2016).

Combination therapy may be associated with decreased patient adherence to therapy and an increased incidence of AEs and drug interactions. When combination therapy is needed, it is recommended to select products with different mechanisms of action and AE profiles. There is little comparative clinical data to support the use of specific combinations ( Schachter et al 2018 ). Several broad classes of AEDs are available, including barbiturates, benzodiaze pines, hydantoins, and miscellaneous agents (see Table 1). Of these agents, mephobarbital and ezogabine are not currently marketed as either brand or generic formulations, but are included in this review for informational and historical purposes. Cannibid iol (Epidiolex) was FDA -approved in June 2018 for use in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with LGS or Dravet syndrome ( FDA news release 2018). It is the first FDA -approved drug for treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome and is the first approved drug that contains a purified substance, cannabidiol, derived from marijuana. It is pend ing a Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA) scheduling designation (GW Pharmaceuticals News Release) . Stiripentol (Diacomit) capsules and powder for oral suspension were FDA -approved in August 2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age and older taking clobazam. Everolimus tablets for oral suspension (Afinitor Disperz) received an expanded indication in April 2018 for use in partial - onset seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). This product is a kinase inhibitor that also has several oncology indications. Several of the AEDs are used for additional indications beyond the management of epilepsy, including (but not limited to) bipolar disorder, migraine prophylaxis, and several types of neuropathic pain. These additional indications are listed in Table 2; however, this review primarily focuses on the use of AEDs for t he management of epilepsy. Additionally, brands and formulations FDA -approved and marketed only for non- epilepsy indications are not included within this review; these include gabapentin tablets (Gralise), FDA -approved only management gabapentin enacarbil extended- release of postherpetic neuralgia and treatment of moderate- to-severe restless leg syndrome, and pregabalin extended- release tablets (Lyrica CR), FDA - approved only for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral hypnotic s Table 1.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SU MMARY Overall, the anticonvulsants have demonstrated efficacy for their FDA -approved uses. Clinical trial data demonstrating efficacy of the anticonvulsants for the treatment of epilepsy is described in the prescribing information for the individual products, particularly for anticonvulsants more recently approved by the FDA. However, the prescribing information for some older, conventional (eg, mephobarbital, phenobarbital) do not contain efficacy data in their prescribing information. No single AED is clearly the most effective. Comparative efficacy data for the management of epilepsy are limited, and trials have generally not shown significant differences among drugs in terms of efficacy . However, the quality of the data is limited and generally derived from short -term trials ( Karceski 2017). When possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred treatment approach. Combination therapy may be associated with decreased patient adherence to therapy and an increased incidence of AEs and drug interactions. (Schachter et al 2018 ). Most patients with epilepsy are treated with anticonvulsant monotherapy ( Nevitt et al 2017) . An evidence review summarized AED efficacy and effectiveness as initial monotherapy for epileptic seizures and syndromes ( Glauser et al 2013). This publication provides conclusions based on a review of 64 randomized trials and 11 meta- analyses. Conclusions include the following: As initial monotherapy for adults with newly diagnosed or untreated partial -onset seizures: Carbamazepine, levetiracetam, phenytoin, are potentially efficacious/effective. As initial monotherapy for children with newly diagnosed or untreated partial -onset zonisamide are potentially as of August 20, 2018 RS -U/JZ -U/AKS Page 30 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

As initial monotherapy for elderly adults with newly diagnosed or untreated partial -onset seizures: Gabapentin and lamotrigine are Topiramate and valproate are potentially efficacious/effective. As initial monotherapy for adults with newly diagnosed or or aggravate generalized- onset tonic -clonic seizures . For children with newly diagnosed or -clonic seizures: efficacious/effective. Carbamazepine and phenytoin or aggravate generalized- onset tonic -clonic seizures . As initial monotherapy for children with newly diagnosed or untreated absence seizures: Ethosuximide and valproate are established as efficacious/effective. vigabatrin may precipitate or aggravate absence seizures (based on scattered reports). As initial monotherapy for children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes Carbamazepine oxcarbazepine, and sulthiame (not available in the United States) are potentially efficacious/effective. For patients with newly diagnosed JME: absence, myoclonic, and in some cases generalized tonic -clonic seizures . There has also been a report that lamotrigine may exacerbate seizures in JME. There is a lack of well -designed randomized trials in epilepsy , particularly for generalized seizures and in the pediatric population. A Cochrane systematic review evaluated the efficacy of AED monotherapy for epilepsy ( Nevitt et al 2017). The the treatment of partial onset seizures (simple partial, complex partial or secondarily generalized) or generalized tonic -clonic seizures with or without other generalized seizure types. This n etwork meta- analysis showed that for the primary outcome, the t ime to wit hdrawal of allocated treatment: For individuals with partial seizures : (i) Levetiracetam performed better than carbamazepine and lamotrigine. (ii) Lamotrigine performed better than all other treatments (aside from levetiracetam) . (iii) Carbamazepine performed better than gabapentin and phenobarbit al. For individuals with generali zed onset seizures, valproate performed better than carbamazepine, topiramate and phenobarbit al. For both partial and generali zed onset seizures, phenobarbit al seems to perform worse than all other treatments. For the secondary outcome, time to first seizure: For individuals with partial seizures , phenobarbital and phenytoin seem to perform better than most other drugs ; and carbamazepine performed better than valproate, gabapentin, and lamotrigine. For individuals with generalized seizures, phenytoin seems to work better than most other drugs. There were few notable differences between the newer drugs (oxcarbazepine, topiramate, gabapentin, levetiracetam, and zonisamide) for either partial seizures or generalized seizures. Few notable differences were shown for either partial or generalized seizure types for the secondary outcomes of time to 6- month or 12- month remission of seizures . Overall, direct evidence and network meta- analysis estimates were numerically similar, and effect sizes had overlapping confidence intervals.

Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or ot her qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing inf ormation and published resources when making medical decisions. Data for individuals with generalized seizures are still limited and additional randomized trials are needed. The relative efficacy for generalized (n = 7 studies) or absence seizures (n = 3 studies) was evaluated in a systematic r eview and network meta- analysis (Campos et al 2018) . The outcomes analyzed were seizure freedom and withdrawal due to inefficacy. Compared to valproate, phenytoin had a lower odds of seizure freedom (OR 0.50; 95% credible Interval [CrI] 0.27 to 0.87) in patients with generalized tonic -clonic seizures. Lamotrigine had the highest probability of seizure freedom and valproate had the highest probability of withdrawal due to inefficacy in these patients . For absence seizures, ethosuximide and valproate were found to have a higher probability of seizure freedom compared to lamotrigine. A meta- analysis estimated the comparative efficacy of achieving seizure freedom with 22 antiepileptic drugs and placebo in children and adolescents (Rosati et al 2018) . For the treatment of newly diagnosed focal epilepsy (n = 4 studies), point estimates suggested superiority of carbamazepine and lamotrigine ; however, this was not statistically significant. For refractory focal epilepsy (n = 9 studies) , levetiracetam and perampanel w ere more effective than placebo in mixed comparisons. Ethosuximide and valproic acid were more effective than lamotrigine for absence seizures. The authors concluded that better designed comparative studies with appropriate length of follow -up, well -defined outcomes, and reliable inclusion criteria are needed to validate these results. Approximately 20% to 40% of patients with epilepsy can be considered refractory to drug treatment, referred to as drug- resistant epilepsy. Treatment of drug- resistant epilepsy may include additional anticonvulsant drug trials, epilepsy surgery, vagal nerve stimulation, and dietary changes (the ketogenic diet) ( Sirven 2017). Combination AED regimens are an option for the treatment of drug- resistant epilepsy. However, robust clinical evidence of suitable combinations of AEDs has been difficult to generate due to the large number of possible combinations of drugs and doses. Examples of combinations f or which there is some evidence of efficacy include valproate plus lamotrigine for partial -onset and generalized seizures, valproate plus ethosuximide for absence seizures, and lamotrigine plus topiramate for various seizure types; however, even this evidence is fairly limited. In general, when considering combination therapy, it is recommended to combine medications with different mechanisms of action, and to be mindful of the overall drug load to minimize AEs. Two -drug therapy should be attempted before c onsidering addition of a third drug, and higher numbers of drugs should be avoided as they are associated with a very low likelihood of additional seizure reduction ( Kwan et al 2011). A meta -analysis examined the efficacy of newer AEDs (eslicarbazepine, br ivaracetam, perampanel, and lacosamide) versus levetiracetam as adjunct ive therapy for uncontrolled partial -onset seizures. Most patients in this meta- analysis were on at least 2 other AED s at the time of treatment. In this analysis, eslicarbazepine, lacosamide, and brivaracetam were non- inferior to levetiracetam in terms of efficacy, but all newer AEDs except brivaracetam had worse tolerability profiles than levetiracetam at high doses ( Zhu et al 2017). A network meta- analysis examined the efficacy of AED refractory partial -onset seizures while using monotherapy ( Zhao et al 2017). The efficacy outcomes studied were 50% responder rate and state of seizure freedom. The authors concluded that topiramate, levetiracetam, pregabalin, and oxcarbazepine were prefer able for their relatively high efficacy and low risk of AEs . Rufinamide was the least preferable medication due to its low efficacy and high risk of AEs . A network meta- analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 17 newer AEDs for treatment of refractory partial - onset epilepsy with or without secondary generalization (Hu et al 2018) . The primary outcome was seizure freedom, which was defined as a 100% seizure reduction in the maintenance or double- blind treatment period of the trial. Safety was asses sed by the withdrawal rate due to treatment -emergent AEs. Based on results of 54 studies that evaluated the efficacy outcome, the most effective agents included tiagabine, brivaracetam, and valproic acid, and the least effective agents included rufinamide, lamotrigine, and zonisamide. Products with favorable safety included levetiracetam, brivaracetam, and perampanel, while those with the least favorable safety included retigabine, oxcarbazepine, and rufinamide. The authors stated that agents with the best outcomes in term s of efficacy and safety included levetiracetam, vigabatrin, valproic acid, and brivaracetam. Cannibidiol (Epidiolex) was approved in June 2018 for use in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with LGS or Dravet syndrome ( FDA news release 2018). It is the first FDA -approved drug for treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome and is the first approved drug that contains a purified substance, cannabidiol, derived from marijuana. Its approval for these 2 indications was based on 3 plac ebo-controlled trials in patients refractory to other treatments.

Epidiolex , along with use of other agents , demonstrated a significant reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo. To date, no comparative trials have been published. Everolimus tablets for oral suspension (Afinitor Disperz) received an expanded indication for adjunctive use in TSC - associated partial -onset seizures in April 2018. Results of a randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled study of 366 patients with inadequately control led seizures on 2 or more AEDs demonstrated a significant reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo (French et al 2016) . In August 2018, the FDA approv ed a second drug, stiripentol (Diacomit), for use in the treatment of seizures associated with D ravet syndrome. Two multicenter placebo- controlled studies evaluated the addition of stiripentol to clobazam and valproate therapy in patients 3 years to less than 18 years of age with Dravet syndrome. Responder rates (seizure frequency reduced by 50%) with respect to generalized tonic -clonic seizures were significantly lower with stiripentol compared to placebo (Diacomit prescribing information 2018) . CLINICAL GUIDELINES Efficacy and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drugs I: treatment of new -onset epilepsy . American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( French et al 2004A , Kanner et al, 2018A ). A 2018 update to the 2004 guideline focuses on treatment of new -onset epilepsy with second and third generation AEDs. The 2004 publication summ arizes the oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and zonisamide for the treatment of children and adults with newly diagnosed partial and generalized epilepsies. The r ecommendati ons from the 2004 guideline include the following: Patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy who require treatment can be initially treated with standard AEDs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, or topiramate. Choice will depend on individual patient characteristics. Lamotrigine can be included in the options for children with newly diagnosed absence seizures. The 2018 recommendations include the following : As monother apy i n adult patients with new -onset focal epilepsy or unclassified generalized tonic -clonic seizures: Lamotrigine use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency. Lamotrigine use should be considered and gabapentin use may be considered to decrease seizure frequency in patients aged 60 years. Levetiracetam use and zonisamide use may be considered to decrease s eizure frequency. Vigabatrin appears to be less efficacious than carbamazepine immediate- release and may not be offered; furthermore, the toxicity profile precludes vigabatrin use as first -line therapy . Pregabalin 150 mg per day is possibly less efficacious than lamotrigine 100 mg per day . There is insufficient evidence to consider use of gaba pentin, oxcarbazepine, or topiramate over carbamazepine. There is insufficient evidence to consider use of topiramate instead of phenytoin in urgent treatment of new - onset or recurrent focal epilepsy, unclassified generalized tonic -clonic seizures, or generalized epilepsy presenting with generalized tonic -clonic seizures. Data are lacking to s upport or refute of for new-onset epilepsy. Data are lacking to support or refute use of newer AEDs in treating unclassified generalized tonic -clonic seizures. Ethosuximide or valproic acid should be considered before lamotrigine to decrease seizure frequency in children with absence epilepsy. An exception would be if there are compelling AE -related concerns with use of ethosuximide or valproic acid. The guideline does not address newly approved agents including cannabidiol, everolimus, or stiripentol. Efficacy and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drugs II: treatment of refractory epilepsy .

Recommendations from the 2004 guideline include the following: It is appropriate to use levetiracetam, epilepsy . Oxcarbazepine, topiramate , and lamotrigine can be as monotherapy in patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Topiramate may be used for the treatment of refractory generalized tonic -clonic seizures in adults and ch ildren. lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate may be used treatment of children with refractory partial seizures . Topiramate and lamotrigine may be used to treat drop attacks associated with LGS in adults and children . Recomm endations from the 2018 guideline include the following: As adjunctive therapy i n patients with treatment -resistant adult focal epilepsy (TRAFE): Immediate- release pregabalin and perampanel are established as effective to reduce seizure frequency. Lacosami de, eslicarbazepine, and extended- release topiramate should be considered to decrease seizure frequency. Vigaba trin and rufinamide are effective for decreasing seizure frequency , but are not first-line agents . Ezogabine use should be considered to reduce seizure frequency, but carries a serious risk of skin and retinal discoloration. Clobazam and extended- release oxcarbazepine may be considered to decrease seizure frequency. As monotherapy in patients with TRAFE: Eslicarbazepine use may be consi dered to decrease seizure frequency. Data are insufficient to recommend use of second- and the other third- generation AEDs. For add- on therapy for generalized epilepsy, immediate- release and extended- release lamotrigine should be considered as add- on thera py to decrease seizure frequency in adults with treatment -resistant generalized tonic -clonic seizures secondary to generalized epilepsy. Levetiracetam use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency as add- on therapy for treatment -resistant generali zed tonic -clonic seizures and for treatment -resistant juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Rufinamide is effective to reduce seizure frequency as add- on therapy for LGS . Clobazam use should be considered as add- on therapy for LGS . For add- on therapy in pediatric patients with treatment -resistant focal epilepsy: Levetiracetam use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (ages 1 month to 16 years). Zonisamide use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (age 6 to 17 years). Oxcarbazepine use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (age 1 month to 4 years). Data are unavailable on the efficacy of clobazam, eslicarbazepine, lacosamide, perampanel, rufinamide, tiagabine, or vigabatrin. The newly approved agents including cannabidiol, everolimus, or stiripentol. Evidence- based guideline: management of an unprovoked first seizure in adults. Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society ( Krumholz et al 2015). This practice guideline makes recommendations based on a consideration of the evidence for prognosis and treatment of adults with an unprovoked first seizure. Recommendations include the following: Adults presenting with an unprovoked first seizure should be informed that the chance for a recurrent seizure is greatest within the first 2 years after a first seizure (21% to 45%). Clinicians should also advise such patients that clinical factors associa ted with an increased risk of seizure recurrence include a prior brain insult such as a stroke or trauma, an EEG with epileptiform abnormalities, a significant brain -imaging abnormality, or a nocturnal seizure. Clinicians should advise patients that, altho ugh immediate AED therapy, as compared with delay of treatment pending a second seizure, is likely to reduce the risk of a seizure recurrence in the 2 years subsequent to a first seizure, it may not improve quality of life . Clinicians should advise patient s that over the longer term (> 3 years), immediate AED treatment is unlikely to improve the prognosis for sustained seizure remission.

Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or ot her qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing inf ormation and published resources when making medical decisions. Patients should be advised that their risk for AED AEs ranges from 7% to 31% and that these AEs are predominantly mild an d reversible. Immediate AED therapy after an unprovoked first seizure is likely to reduce seizure recurrence risk. A reduction in risk may be important, particularly for adults, for whom seizure recurrences may cause serious psychological and social consequences such as loss of driving privileges and limitations on employment. However, immediate AED treatment is not well accepted and is debated. Decisions should be based on weighing the risk of recurrence against the AEs of AED therapy, and should take pati ent preferences into account. It is accepted that when a patient has a second or additional seizures, an AED should be initiated because the risk of subsequent seizures is very high. Evidence- based guideline: t reatment of convulsive status epilepticus in c hildren and adults. Guideline Committee of the American Epilepsy Society (Glauser et al 2016). This publication provides conclusions and a treatment algorithm based on a structured literature review of randomized trials of anticonvulsant treatments for sei zures lasting longer than 5 minutes. A total of 38 trials were included. For treatment in the adult population, c onclusions included the following: Intramuscular ( IM) midazolam, (with or without phenytoin), and IV phenobarbital are established as efficacious at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes . IV lorazepam is more effective than IV phenytoin in stopping seizures lasting at least 10 minutes . There is no difference in efficacy between IV lorazepam followed by IV phenytoin, IV diazepam plus phenytoin followed by IV lorazepam, and IV phenobarbital followed by IV phenytoin. IV valproic acid has similar efficacy to IV phenytoin or continuous IV diazepam as second therapy after failure of a benzodiazepine. Insuf ficient data exist in adults about the efficacy of levetiracetam as either initial or second therapy. In adults with status epilepticus without established IV access, IM midazolam is established as more effective compared with IV lorazepam. No significant difference in effectiveness has been demonstrated between lorazepam and diazepam in adults with status epilepticus. For treatment in the pediatric population, c onclusions included the following: IV lorazepam and IV diazepam are established as efficacious a t stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes . Rectal diazepam, IM midazolam, intranasal midazolam, and buccal midazolam are probably effective at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes. Insufficient data exist in children about the efficacy of intr as initial therapy. IV valproic acid has similar efficacy but better tolerability than IV phenobarbital as second therapy after failure of a benzodiazepine. Insufficient data exist in children regarding the efficacy of phenytoin or levetiracetam as second therapy after failure of a ben zodiazepine. In children with status epilepticus, no significant difference in effectiveness has been established between IV lorazepam and IV diazepam. In children with status epilepticus, non- IV midazolam (IM/intranasal/buccal) is probably more effective than diazepam (IV/rectal). Conclusions included the following (age not specified): Insufficient data exist about the comparative efficacy of phenytoin and fosphenytoin. Fosphenytoin is better tolerated compared with phenytoin. When both are available, fosphenytoin is preferred based on tolerability, but phenytoin is an acceptable alternative. The overall treatment algorithm directs that: A benzodiazepine (IM midazolam, IV lorazepam, or IV diazepam) is recommended as the initial therapy of choice in the firs t phase of treatment (5 to 20 minutes after the beginning of the seizure). Although IV phenobarbital is established as efficacious and well tolerated as initial therapy, its slower rate of administration positions it as an alternative initial therapy. For prehospital settings or where first -line benzodiazepine options are not available, rectal diazepam, intranasal midazolam, and buccal midazolam are reasonable initial therapy alternatives. In the second phase of treatment (from 20 to 40 minutes after the beginning of the seizure), reasonable options include fosphenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. There is no clear evidence that any of these options is Data as of August 20, 2018 RS -U/JZ -U/AKS Page 35 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Because of AEs , IV phenobarbital is a reasonable second- therapy alternative if none of the 3 recommended therapies are available. There is no clear evidence to guide therapy in the third phase of therapy ( 40 minutes after the beginning of the seizure) . Evidence- based guideline update: medical treatment of infantile spasms. Guide line Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society ( Go et al 2012). (Reaffirmed July 18, 2015) This publication provides updated recommendations for the treatment of infantile spasm s. The literature review included an evaluation of 26 published articles on this topic. Recommendations include the following: Evidence is insufficient to recommend the use of prednisolone, dexamethasone, and methylprednisolone as being as effective as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for short -term treatment of infantile spasm s. Low-dose ACTH should be considered as an alternative to high- dose ACTH for treatment of infantile spasms. ACTH or vigabatrin may be offered for short -term treatment of infantile s pasms; evidence suggests that ACTH may be offered over vigabatrin. Evidence is insufficient to recommend other therapies (valproic acid, vitamin B6, nitrazepam [not ketogenic diet, or novel/combination therapies ) for treatment of infantile spasms. Hormonal therapy (ACTH or prednisolone) may be considered for use in preference to vigabatrin in infants with cryptogenic infantile spasms, to possibly improve developmental outcome. A sho rter lag time to treatment of infantile spasms with either hormonal therapy or vigabatrin may be considered to improve long -term cognitive outcomes. There is a lack of sufficient randomized trials to provide definitive answers to key questions related to treatment of infantile spams. Practice parameter: treatment of the child with a first unprovoked seizure. Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society ( Hirtz et al 2003 ). (Reaffirmed January 23, 2016) This parameter reviews published literature relevant to the decision to begin treatment after a child or adolescent experiences a first unprovoked seizure and presents evidence- based practice recommendations . Treatment during the neonatal period is not addressed. Recommendations include the following: Treatment with AEDs is not indicated for the prevention of the development of epilepsy. Treatment with AEDs may be considered in circumstances where the benefits of reducing the risk of a second seizure outweigh the risks of pharmacologic and psychosocial AEs. The majority of children who experience a first unprovoked seizure will have few or no recurrences. Treatment with AEDs after a first seizure as opposed to after a second seizure has not been shown to improve prognosis for long- term seizure remission. Treatment has been shown in several studies combining both children and adults to reduce the risk of seizure recurrence; how ever, there is a relative paucity of data from studies involving only children after a first seizure. Summary of recommendations for the management of infantile seizures . Task force report for the ILAE Commission of Pediatrics ( Wilmshurst et al 2015). This publication recommends an approach to the standard and optimal management of infants with seizures. When possible, recommendations are evidence- based; however, when no evidence was available, recommendations are based on expert opinion and standard prac tice. Recommendations/findings include the following: There is no indication for initiation of chronic AEDs for simple febrile seizures. However, in the acute treatment of febrile seizures, it is important to treat seizures lasting 10 minutes or longer. In an otherwise healthy infant, a policy of \"wait and see\" is reasonable after the first afebrile seizure. However, this is a rare event and close monitoring is essential. Treatment options with established or probable efficacy include the following: Focal seizures: levetiracetam Epileptic spasms: High- dose or low -dose ACTH Data as of August 20, 2018 RS -U/JZ -U/AKS Page 36 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

This document was prepared based on a systematic review of the literature and involved cooperation between the WHO, the ILAE, and the International Bureau of Epilepsy (IBE). Recommendations include the following: Phenobarbital should be used as the first -line agent for treatment of neonatal seizures and should be made readily available in all settings. In neonates who continue to have seizures despite administering the maxim um tolerated dose of phenobarbital, either a benzodiazepine, phenytoi n, or lidocaine may be used as the second- line agent for control of seizures (use of phenytoin or lidocaine requires cardiac monitoring). In neonates with a normal neurological examination and/or normal EEG, stopping AEDs may be considered if the neonate has been seizure- free for > 72 hours; the drug(s) should be reinstituted if seizures recur . In neonates in whom seizure control is achieved with a single AED, the drug can be discontinued abruptly without tapering the dose. In neonates requiring > 1 AED for seizure control, the drugs may be stopped one at a time , with phenobarbital being the last drug to be withdrawn. Practice parameter updat e: management issues for women with epilepsy - focus on pregnancy (an evidence - based review): teratogenesis and perinatal outcomes. Quality Standards Subcommittee and Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Harden et al 2009A ). (Reaffirmed July 13, 2013) This publication summarizes evidence for selected issues regarding the clinical management of women with epilepsy (WWE) who are pregnant or plan ning to be pregnant . Recommendations include the following: If possible, avoidance of the use of valproate as part of polytherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy should be considered to decrease the risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs). If possible, avoidance of the use of valproate monotherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy may be considered to decrease the risk of MCMs. To reduce the risk of MCMs, the use of valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy should be avoided, if possible, compared to the use of carbamazepine. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avoidance of the use of polytherapy with valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible, should be considered, compared to polytherapy without valproate. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avoidance of the use of valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible, may be considered, compared to the use of phenytoin or lamotrigine. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avoidance of the use of AED polytherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible, compared to monotherapy should be considered. Limiting the dosage of valproate or lamotrigine during the first trimester, if possible, should be considered to lessen the risk of MCMs. Avoidance of the use of valproate, if possible, should be consi dered to reduce the risk of neural tube defects and facial clefts , and may be considered to reduce the risk of hypospadias. Avoidance of phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital , if possible, may be considered to reduce the risk of specific MCMs: cleft palate for phenytoin use, posterior cleft palate use, and cardiac malformations for phenobarbital use. Carbamazepine exposure probably does not produce cognitive impairment in offspring of WWE. Avoiding valproate in WWE during pregnancy, if possible, should be considered to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Avoiding phenyto in and phenobarbital in WWE during pregnancy, if possible, may be considered to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Monotherapy should be considered in place of polytherapy, if possible, for WWE who take AEDs during pregnancy to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. For WWE who are pregnant, avoidance of valproate, if possible, should be considered compared to carbamazepine to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. For WWE who are pregnant, avoidance of valproate, if possible, may be considered compared to phenytoin to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Valproate has the most data showing an association with risk from in utero expos ure. If a change from valproate to another AED is planned, it is prudent to make this change well before pregnancy.

Although many of the recommendations in this parameter suggest minimizing AED exposure during pregnancy, for most WWE, discontinuing AEDs i s not a reasonable or safe option. Discontinuing AEDs may expose the mother and fetus to physical injury from accidents due to seizure activity. Practice parameter update: management issues for women with epilepsy - focus on pregnancy (an evidence - based review): vitamin K, folic acid, blood levels, and breastfeeding. Quality Standards Subcommittee and Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Harden et al 2009B ). (Reaffirmed July 13, 2013) This publication summarizes evidence for selected issues regarding the clinical management of WWE who are pregnant or planning to be pregnant . Recommendations include the following: placenta may be factored into the clinical decision regarding the necessity of AED treatment for a woman with epilepsy . Monitoring of lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and phenytoin levels during pregnancy should be considered. Monitoring of levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine (as monohydroxy derivative) levels during pregnancy may be considered. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute a change in phenobarbital, v alproate, primidone, or ethosuximide levels related to pregnancy, but this lack of evidence should not discourage monitoring levels of these AEDs during pregnancy. Valproate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine may not transfer into breast milk to as great an extent as primidone, levetiracetam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and topiramate. Although many of the AEDs were shown to cross the placenta or enter breast milk, studies were limited in duration and did not systematically evaluate neonatal symptoms . Guidelines also support the use of AEDs for several common non- epilepsy indications: The American Academy of Neurology and American Headache Society state that AEDs with established efficacy for migraine prevention include valproate, divalproex sodium, and topiramate; carbamazepine is noted to be possibl y effective ( Silberstein et al 2012). The American Academy of Neurology, American Association of Neuromus cular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine, and American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation state that, for relief of painful diabetic neuropathy, pregabalin is established as effective, and gabapentin and valproate are probably effective ( Bril et a l 2011). The American Academy of Neurology states that gabapentin and pregabalin are of benefit in reducing pain from postherpetic neuralgia ( Dubinsky et al 2004). American Psychiatric Association guidelines describe the key role of AEDs in the management of bipolar disorder, including the following ( Hirschfeld et al 2002): First-line pharmacological treatment for more severe manic or mixed episodes is either lithium plus an antipsychotic or valproate plus an antipsychotic; for less ill patients, monotherap y with lithium, valproate, or an antipsychotic may be sufficient. For mixed episodes, valproate may be preferred over lithium. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are alternatives. First-line pharmacological treatment for bipolar depression is either lithium or lamotrigine. When an acute depressive episode of bipolar disorder does not respond to first -line medication treatment , the next steps include adding lamotrigine, bupropion, or paroxetine . The initial treatment for patients who experience rapid cycling should include lithium or valproate; an alternative is lamotrigine. The medications with the best empirical evidence to support their use in maintenance treatment include lithium and valproate; possible alternatives include lamotrigine, carbamazepine, or oxc arbazepine. Note: This guideline was published in 2002 and cannot be assumed to be current; however, AEDs continue to be recommended for both acute (mania or hypomania) and maintenance phases of bipolar disorder (Post 2017, Stovall 2018 ).

SAFETY SUMMARY Tolerability and safety are as important as efficacy in determining the overall effectiveness of epilepsy treatment (Schachter 201 8). Common AEs among AEDs include the following ( Schachter 2018 ). Systemic AEs: nausea, vomiting, nervousness, insomnia aggression, irritability, behavioral changes , hyperactivity attention disturbance, inattention depression, mood alteration confusion, memory impairment ataxia, abnormal coordination, falls blurred or double vision Examples of r are but serious AEs include the following (Schachter 201 8): suicidal ideation and behavior (AED s boxed warnings related to potentially serious AEs; these include the following: Carbamazepine: Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including TEN and SJS, have been reported. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA -B*1502, an i nherited allelic variant of the HLA -B gene. Patients with ancestry in genetically at-risk populations (across broad areas of Asia) should be screened for the presence of HLA -B*1502 prior to initiating treatment with carbamazepine. Aplastic anemia and agra nulocytosis have been reported. If a patient exhibits low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, the patient should be monitored closely, and discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of significant bone marrow depression develops. Clobazam, c lonazepam , clorazepate, and diazepam: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Concomitant prescribing should be reserved for use in patients for whom alternative Data as of August 20, 2018 RS -U/JZ -U/AKS Page 40 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing inf ormation and published resources when making medical decisions. treatment options are inadequate, and patients should be followed for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Ezogabine: Ezogabine can cause retinal and macular abnormalities and may be associated with vision loss. Ezogabine should only be used in patients who have responded inadequately to several alternative treatments and for whom the benefits outweigh the potential risk of vision loss. Ezogabine should be discontinued in p atients who fail to show substantial clinical benefit after adequate titration. All patients taking ezogabine should have baseline and periodic (every 6 months) systematic visual monitoring by an ophthalmic professional. If retinal pigmentary abnormalities or vision changes are detected, ezogabine should be di scontinued unless no other suitable treatment options are available and the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk of vision loss . Felbamate: Use is associated with a marked increase in the incidence of aplastic anemia. Felbamate should only be used in patients whose epilepsy is so severe that the risk of aplastic anemia is deemed acceptable. Routine blood testing cannot be reliably used to reduce the incidence of aplastic anemia, but it will in some cases allow detection of hematologic changes before the syndrome declares itself clinically. Felbamate should be discontinued if any evidence of bone marrow depression occurs. Cases of acute liver failure have been reported. Felbamate should not be prescribed for anyone with a history of hepatic dysfunction. Treatment should be initiated only in individuals without active liver disease and with normal baseline serum transaminases. It has not been proven that periodic serum transaminase testing will prevent ser ious injury, but it is generally believed that early detection of drug- induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect drug enhances the likelihood for recovery. Serum transaminases should be monitored at baseline and periodically thereafter. Felbamate should be discontinued if either AST or ALT become increased to 2 times the upper limit of normal, or if clinical signs and symptoms suggest liver failure, and should not be considered for retreatment. Fosphenytoin and phenytoin: There is a cardiovascular risk associated with rapid IV infusion rates. The rate of administration should not exceed recommendations, and careful cardiac monitoring is required. Lamotrigine: Cases of life- threatening serious skin rashes, including SJS and TEN, and/or rash -related death have been caused by lamotrigine. Benign rashes are also caused by lamotrigine; however, it is not possible to predict which rashes will prove to be serious. Lamotrigine should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless th e rash is clearly not drug related. Perampanel: Serious or life- threatening psychiatric and behavioral AEs including aggression, hostility, irritability, anger, and homicidal ideation and threats have been reported. Patients should be monitored for these reactions and for changes in mood, behavior, or personality. The dose should be reduced if these symptoms occur, and it should be discontinued if symptoms are severe or worsening. Valproic acid and divalproex sodium : Hepatoxicity, including fata lities, have been reported, usually during the first 6 months of treatment. Serum liver tests are required and p atients should be monitored closely. There is a risk to fetuses exposed in utero, particularly neural tube defects, other major malformations, and decreased intelligence quotient (IQ). Valproate should not be given to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition, and women should use effective contraception while using valproate. Pancrea titis, including fatal hemorrhagic cases, has occurred. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. Vigabatrin: Vigabatrin can cause permanent bilateral concentric visual field constriction, including tunnel vision that can result in disability. In some cases, vigabatrin may also damage the central retina and may decrease visual acuity. Baseline and periodic vision assessment is recommended. However, this assessment cannot always prevent vision damage, and once detected, vision loss due to vigabatrin is not reversible. Vigabatrin should be withdrawn from patients who fail to show substantial clinical benefit.

Due to the risks of vision loss, vigabatrin is available only through a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program ( Vigabatrin REMS 2017). Healthcare providers who prescribe vigabatrin and pharmacies that dispense the product must be specially certified. Each patient mus t be enrolled in the REMS program. Prescribers must ensure that periodic visual monitoring is performed and report any AE suggestive of vision loss to the vigabatrin REMS program. Everolimus is an antineoplastic, immunosuppressant agent associated with several adverse reactions.

These products vary in terms of their indications for specific seizure types and indic ations other than epilepsy. Overall, the anticonvulsants have demonstrated efficacy for their FDA -approved uses. When possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred treatment approach. Patients who are refractory to monotherapy may be treated wit h combination therapy. When considering combination therapy, it is recommended to combine medications with different mechanisms of action and AE profiles. Comparative efficacy data for the management of epilepsy are limited. Tolerability and safety are as important as efficacy in determining the overall effectiveness of epilepsy treatment. Both systemic AEs and neurologic AEs commonly occur. Some AEDs are associated with rare but serious AE s, and careful patient selection and monitoring are required. Epilepsy management can be complex and it is often treated by neurologists. A variety of AEDs should be available to allow clinicians to select the most clinically appropriate agent for individual patients. Anticonvulsants are also established as effective for several non -epilepsy indications, including (but not limited to) bipolar disorder, migraine prophylaxis, and neuropathic pain.

Therapeutic Class Overview Antiasthmatic - Monoclonal Antibodies INTRODUCTION Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways, making it difficult to breathe. Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI] 2014 ). The exact cause(s) of asthma are unknown. A combination of factors such as genetics, certain respiratory infections during childhood, and contact with airborne allergens can contribute to its development ( NHLBI 2014 ). The goal of asthma management - asthma control - can be described in the following domains (NHLBI 2007 ): Reduction of impairment Prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms (e.g., coughing or breathlessness in the daytime, at night, or after exertion) Require infrequent use (2 days a week) of short -acting beta- agonist (SABA) for quick relief of symptoms Maintain (near) normal pulmonary function Maintain normal activity levels (including exercise and other physical activity and attendance at work or school) Meet patients' and families' expectations of and satisfaction with asthma care. Reduction of risk Prevent recurrent exacerbations of asthma and minimize the need for emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations Prevent progressive loss of lung function; for children, prevent reduced lung growth Provide optimal pharmacotherapy with minimal or no adverse effects. Current pharmacologic options for asthma management are categorized as: (1) long- term control medications to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma, and (2) quick -relief medications used to treat acute symptoms and exacerbations. Long- term control medications i nclude: Corticosteroids (inhaled corticosteroids [ICS] for long- term control; short courses of oral corticosteroids to gain prompt control of disease, long- term oral corticosteroids for severe persistent asthma) Cromolyn sodium and nedocromil as an alternative bronchodilator for those not tolerating a S ABA SABAs (therapy of choice for relief of acute symptoms and prevention of exercise -induced bronchospasm) Systemic corticosteroids (not short -acting, but used for moderate and severe exacerbations) ( NHLBI 2007 ) Approximately 5 to 10% of asthma patients have severe disease. Severe asthma includes various clinical phenotypes of poorly controlled asthma characterized by frequent use of high- dose ICS and/or oral corticosteroids ( Chung et al 2014). While there are cur rently no widely accepted definitions of specific asthma phenotypes, several strategies have been proposed to categorize severe asthma phenotypes based on characteristics such as patient age, disease onset, corticosteroid resistance, chronic airflow obstruction, or type of cellular infiltrate in the airway lumen or lung tissue (Walford et a l 2014). Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), also called chronic urticaria or spontaneous urticaria, is defined by the presence of hives on most days of the week for a period of 6 weeks or longer, with or without angioedema. The hives are circumscribed, raised, erythematous plaques, often with central pallor, and variable in size. No external allergic cause or contributing disease process can be identified in 80 to 90% of adults and children with CIU ( Khan 2017, Saini 2017). CIU affects up to 1% of the general population in the United States, and the prevalence is believed to be similar in other countries. The condition is more common in adults than children and typically begins in the third to fifth decades of life.

Patients should always seek the advice of a phys ician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. CIU is a self -limited disorder in most patients although the condition generally has a prolonged duration of 1 to 5 years (Saini 2017). Non- sedating H 1-antihistamines are the cornerstone of therapy for CIU. Limited courses of oral glucocorticoids are often used in combination with antihistamines for refractory symptoms. Other pharmacologic options for patients who do not respond to H 1-antihis tamines include the use of H 2-antihistamines, polyangiitis called Churg- Strauss syndrome, a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that affects small -to-medium -sized vessels. It is typically associated with eosinophilia and severe asthma (Groh et al 2015, Schwartz et al 2016) . EGPA is a rare condition with a prevalence of approximately 13 cases per 1 million persons and an annual incidence of approximately 7 new cases per 1 million persons . It has a higher incidence in patients with asthma (Groh et al 2015) . Systemic glucocorticoids are the mainstay of treatment for EG PA. For refractory E GPA, the intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) can (Groh et al 2015). In more than 85% of patients with EG PA, remission can be achieved with glucocorticoids with or without an immunosuppressant ; however, relapses occur in more than 33% of patients ( Pagnoux 2016). This 5 (IL- 5) antagonists, each approved as an add- on maintenance treatment for patients with severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype. The mechanism of action of Fasenra is slightly different, in that it binds to the IL- 5 receptor on imm une effector cells , whereas Cinqair and Nucala bind to the IL-5 cytokine. Eosinophils play a key role in the pathobiology of airway disorders by contributing to inflammation through release of leukotrienes and pro- inflammatory cytokines. Increases in eosinophils are often correlated with greater asthma severity. IL- 5, a cytokine critical to eosinophil differentiation and survival, has been isolated as a potential target in eosinophilic asthma. Nucala is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with EGPA. Xolair is a recombinant DNA -derived monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to human immunoglobulin E (IgE). Xolair , which reduces the allergic response mediators, is useful in a subset of patients with allergic asthma. In addition, Xolair has been shown to improve symptoms in patients with CIU.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SU MMARY OMALIZUMAB Asthma The original Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of omalizumab was based on the results of 3 randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter trials conducted in patients at least 12 years of age with moderate to severe asthma for at least 1 year and a positive skin test reaction to a perennial aeroallergen. All patients were required to have a baseline IgE between 30 and 700 international unit (IU)/mL and body weight not more than 150 kg. Patients were treated according to a dosing table to administer at least 0.016 mg/kg/IU (IgE/mL) of omalizumab or placebo over each 4- week period. Each study was comprised of a run- in period to achieve a stable conversion to a common ICS, followed by randomization to omalizumab or placebo. Patients received omalizumab for 16 weeks with an unchanged ICS dose unless an acute exacerbation necessitated an increase. Patients then entered an ICS reduction phase of 12 ( Busse et al 2001, Sol\u00e8r et al 2001) and 16 weeks ( Holgate et al 2004) during which ICS dose reduction was attempted in a step- wise manner. In the 28- week study by Bu sse et al (N=525), during the steroid stable phase, patients treated with omalizumab had fewer mean exacerbations/subject (0.28 vs 0.54; P=0.006) and decreased mean duration of exacerbations (7.8 vs 12.7 days; P<0.001) compared with placebo- treated patient s. Similarly, during the steroid reduction phase, omalizumab was associated with fewer exacerbations/subject (0.39 vs 0.66; P=0.003), and a shorter mean exacerbations (9.4 vs 12.6 days; P=0.021) ( Busse et al 2001). In the 28- week study by Sol\u00e8r et al (N=546), asthma exacerbations/patient, the primary endpoint, decreased more in the omalizumab group compared to placebo during both the stable steroid (0.28 vs 0.66; P<0.001) and steroid reduction phases (0.36 vs 0.75; P<0.001) ( Sol\u00e8r et al 2001). In the 32- week study by Holgate et al (N=246), the percentage reduction in ICS dose, the primary endpoint, was greater among patients treated with omalizumab than among patients treated with placebo (median, 60 vs 50%; P=0.003). The percentages of patient s with at least 1 asthma exacerbation were similar between omalizumab and placebo groups during both the stable steroid and steroid reduction phases (P value not reported). The absence of an observed treatment effect may be related to differences in the patient population compared with the first 2 studies, study sample size, or other factors ( Holgate et al 2004).

A meta -analysis of 3 of the previously mentioned trials ( Busse et al 2001, Sol\u00e8r et al 2001, Holgate et al 2004 ) and their extension studies asses sed the efficacy of omalizumab in a subgroup of 254 patients at high risk of serious asthma- related mortality and morbidity. Patients were defined as high- risk due to asthma histories that included the following: intubation history, emergency room visit wi thin the last year, overnight hospitalization, or intensive care unit treatment. The primary outcome was an annualized rate of acute exacerbation episodes based on data from the initial 16- week stable steroid phase for high- risk patients. Two kinds of acut e exacerbation episodes were considered as endpoints: significant acute exacerbation episodes and all acute exacerbation episodes (i.e., all episodes recorded by the investigator). Significant acute exacerbation episodes were defined as those requiring a d oubling of baseline ICS dose (Busse et al 2001, Sol\u00e8r et al 2001) or use of systemic steroids (all 3 studies). During the stable steroid phase, mean significant acute exacerbation episode rates were 1.56 and 0.69/patient -year, respectively, a reduction of 56% with omalizumab (P=0.007). Similar reductions in exacerbations in favor of omalizumab were observed for the whole study period and for all acute exacerbation episodes. The authors concluded that 113 significant acute exacerbation episodes were prevented for every 100 patients treated with omalizumab for 1 year ( Holgate et al 2001). A Cochrane Review conducted in 2014 evaluated the efficacy of omalizumab in patients with allergic asthma. Treatment with omalizumab was associated with a significant reducti on in the odds of a patient having an asthma exacerbation (odds ratio [OR], 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42 to 0.6; 10 studies, 3,261 participants). This represents an absolute reduction from 26% for participants suffering an exacerbation on plac ebo to 16% on omalizumab, over 16 to 60 weeks. Additionally, in patients with moderate to severe asthma and in those who were receiving background ICS therapy, treatment with omalizumab resulted in a significant reduction in the odds of having an asthma ex acerbation (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.6; 7 studies, 1,889 participants). A significant benefit was noted for subcutaneous (SC) omalizumab vs placebo with regard to reducing hospitalizations (OR, 0.16, 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.42; 4 studies, 1,824 participants), representing an absolute reduction in risk from 3% with placebo to 0.5% with omalizumab over 28 to 60 weeks. The authors concluded that omalizumab was effective in reducing asthma exacerbations and hospitalizations as an adjunctive therapy to ICS and significantly more effective than placebo in increasing the numbers of participants who were able to reduce or withdraw their ICS. Omalizumab was generally well tolerated, although there were more injection site reactions with omalizumab. However, the clinica l value of the reduction in steroid consumption has to be considered in light of the high cost of omalizumab ( Normansell et al 2014). A systematic review of 8 randomized, placebo- controlled trials (N=3,429) evaluated the efficacy and safety of SC omalizumab as add- on therapy to corticosteroids in children and adults with moderate to severe allergic asthma. At the end of the steroid reduction phase, patients taking omalizumab were more likely to be able to withdraw corticosteroids completely compared with pl acebo ( relative 95% CI, 1.42 to 2.28; P=0.00001). Omalizumab patients showed a decreased risk for asthma exacerbations at the end of the stable ( RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.64; P=0.0001); post -hoc analysis suggests this effect was independent of duration of treatment, age, severity of asthma, and risk of bias. The frequency of serious adverse effects was similar between omalizumab (3.8%) and placebo (5.3%). However, inj ection site reactions were more frequent in the omalizumab patients (19.9 vs 13.2%). Omalizumab was not associated with an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, cardiovascular effects, or malignant neoplasms ( Rodrigo et al 2011 ). In July 2016, the FDA expanded the indication of omalizumab to patients 6 to 11 years of age with moderate to severe persistent asthma. The approval was based primarily on a 52- week, randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter trial. The study evaluated the s afety and efficacy of omalizumab as add- on therapy in 628 pediatric patients ages 6 to <12 years with moderate to severe asthma inadequately cont rolled despite the use of an ICS (Lanier et al 2009). Over the 24- week fixed- steroid phase, omalizumab reduced the rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations (worsening symptoms requiring doubling of baseline ICS dose and/or systemic steroids) by 31% vs placebo (0.45 vs 0.64; rate ratio , 0.69; P=0.007). Over a period of 52 weeks, the exacerbation rate was reduced by 43% (P<0.001). Other efficacy variables such as nocturnal symptom scores, beta- agonist use, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) were not significantly different in omalizumab- treated patients compared to placebo. A 2017 sys tematic review of 3 randomized, placebo- controlled trials and 5 observational studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of omalizumab in children and adolescents . Omalizumab reduced exacerbations compared with placebo or baseline in all studies that includ ed this outcome. The randomized controlled trials did not identify significant differences in FEV 1; however, 3 of the 4 observational studies that included this outcome did find significant FEV 1 improvement with omalizumab. Generally, ICS and rescue medication use were reduced with omalizumab in the studies.

The EXCELS study was a multicenter, observational cohort study to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and long- term safety of omalizumab in patients with moderate- to-severe allergic asthma. Patients were evaluated as part of 3 groups: non-omalizumab users, those newly starting omalizumab, and those who were established users at study initiation. Interim efficacy results demonstrated that at month 24, the ACT score increased in all 3 patient groups: from 18.4 to 20 in non- omalizumab users, from 15.2 to 19.4 in those newly starting on omalizumab, and from 18.2 to 19.4 in established omalizumab users. For patients newly starting omalizumab treatment, 54% achieved at least a minimally important difference, defined as a 3 point increase from baseline in ACT. The study demonstrated that established users of omalizumab maintain ed asthma control during the study period ( Eisner et al 2012). To investigate the relationship between omalizumab and malignant neoplasms, safety information from the EXCELS trial was analyzed. Similar rates of primary malignancies in omalizumab- and non- omalizumab- treated patients was found. However, study limitations preclude definitively ruling out a malignancy risk with omalizumab ( Long et al 2014). A higher incidence of overall cardiovascular and cerebrovascular serious adverse events was observed in omalizumab- treated patients compared to non- omalizumab- treated patients ( Iribarren et al 2017). To further evaluate the risk, a pooled analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials was conducted. An increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular serious adverse events was not noted, but the low number of events, the young patient population, and the short duration of follow -up prevent a definite conclusion about the abs ence of a risk ( FDA 2014). Patients from the EXCELS study were eligible for the XPORT trial, a 52- week , randomized, placebo- controlled trial evaluating the persistence of response to omalizumab in patients who discontinued omalizumab therapy after long- term use. Patients were randomized to continue their omalizumab therapy or to omalizumab discontinuation. More patients who continued omalizumab did not have an exacerbation compared to those who discontinued therapy (67.0 % vs 47.7%; absolute difference, 19.3%; 95% CI, 5 .0% to 33.6%). The authors concluded that continuation of omalizumab after long- term use results in sustained benefit (Ledford et al 2017) . Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria The safety and efficacy of omalizumab for the treatment of CIU was assessed in 2 placebo- controlled, multiple -dose clinical studies. Patients received omalizumab 75, 150, or 300 mg or placebo by SC injection every 4 weeks in addition to their baseline level of H 1 antihistamine therapy for 24 or 12 weeks, followed by a 16- week washout observation period. In both studies, patients who received omalizumab 150 mg or 300 mg had greater decreases from baseline in weekly itch severity scores and weekly hive count scores than placebo at week 12. The 75 mg dose did not demonstrate consistent evidence of efficacy and is not approved for use ( Kaplan et al 2013, Maurer et al 2013). Another randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled study evaluated omalizumab as add- on therapy for 24 weeks in patients wit h CIU who remained symptomatic despite H 1 antihistamine therapy. Similar to previous studies, patients treated with omalizumab had significantly greater reductions in weekly itch severity score from baseline to week 12 compared to placebo (P0.001) ( Saini et al 2014). A meta -analysis of randomized clinical trials evaluating omalizumab for the treatment of CIU was published in 2016. The analysis included 7 randomized, placebo- controlled studies with 1,312 patients with CIU. Patients treated with omalizumab (75 to 600 mg every 4 weeks) had significantly reduced weekly itch and weekly wheal scores compared with the placebo group. The effects of omalizumab were dose dependent, with the strongest reduction in weekly itch and weekly wheal scores observed with 300 mg. Rates of complete response were significantly higher in the omalizumab group (P<0.00001) and dose dependent, with the highest rates in the 300 mg group. Rates of patients with adverse events were similar in the omalizumab and placebo groups ( Zhao et al 2016). A Phase 4 randomized clinical trial evaluated the effect of omalizumab in 205 patients with antihistamine- resistant CIU/chronic spontaneous urticaria. After an initial 24- week period of open- label treatment with omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks , patients randomized to continue omalizumab for another 24 weeks of double- blind therapy experienced a significantly lower rate of clinical worsening compared with patients randomized to double- blind placebo (21 .0% vs 60.4%, P<0.0001) . No new safety signals were detected over the 48- week omalizumab treatment period (Maurer et al 2017) .

BENRALIZUMAB Asthma The safety and efficacy of benralizumab were evaluated in a 52-week dose- ranging exacerbation trial, 3 confirmatory trials, and a 12-week lung function trial (Bleecker et al 2016, Castro et al 2014, Ferguson et al 2017, Fitzgerald et al 2016, Nair et al 2017) . In a randomized, controlled, double- blind, dose- ranging Phase 2b study, 324 adults with uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma wer e randomly assigned to placebo (n=80), benralizumab 2 mg (n=81), benralizumab 20 mg (n=81), or 100 mg (n=82) and 285 adults with non- eosinophilic asthma were randomized to benralizumab 100 mg (n=142) or placebo (n=143) ( Castro et al 201 4). Tre atments were given as 2 SC injections every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, then every 8 weeks, for 1 year. Among adults with eosinophilic asthma, benralizumab 100 mg reduced exacerbation rates as compared to placebo (0.34 vs 0.57; rate reduction, 41%; 80% CI, 11 to 60, P=0.096). A significant reduction in exacerbation rates was not seen with benralizumab 2 mg or 20 mg as compared to placebo in these patients. In patients with a baseline blood eosinophil count of at least 300 cells/ \u00b5L, exacerbation rates were lower than in the placebo group for the benralizumab 20 mg (0.30 vs 0.68; rate reduction, 57%; 80% , 72; vs controlled, 48 -week, Phase 3 trial (N=1205) involving patients with severe asthma with eosinophilia uncontrolled with h igh-dose ICS and LABAs (Bleecker et al 2016). Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n=407), benrali zumab 30 mg every 4 weeks (n=400), or benralizumab 30 mg every 8 weeks (n=398). Compared with placebo, benralizumab reduced the annual asthma exacerbation rate over 48 weeks when administered every 4 weeks ( rate ratio, 0.55; 95% CI , 0.42 to 0.49; 95% CI , 0.37 to 0.64 ; P<0.0001). Both doses of benralizumab also significantly improved pre- bronchodilator FEV 1 in patients at week 48 vs placebo. Asthma symptoms were improved with benralizumab every 8 weeks, but not every 4 weeks, as compared to placebo. CALIMA was a randomized, multicenter, double- blind, placebo- controlled, 56- week, Phase 3 trial that assessed benralizumab as add- on therapy (to high-dose ICS and LABA ) for patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma and elevated blood eosinophil counts ( Fitzgerald et al 2016 ). A total of 1306 patients were randomly assigned to benralizumab 30 mg every 4 weeks (n=425), benralizumab 30 mg every 8 weeks (n=441) or placebo (n =440). When compared to placebo, significant reductions in annual exacerbation rates were seen with benralizumab every 4 weeks (rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI , 0.49 to 0.85; , 0.54 to 0.95; P=0.0188). Benrali also associated with significantly improved pre- bronchodilator FEV 1 and total asthma symptom scores vs placebo. BISE was a randomized, multicenter, double- blind, placebo- controlled, 12- week, Phase 3 trial that evaluated benralizumab therapy for p atients with mild to moderate persistent asthma ( Ferguson et al 2017). Patients (N=211) had been receiving either low - to medium -dose ICS or low -dose ICS plus LABA therapy and were randomized to benralizumab 30 mg every 4 weeks (n=106) or placebo (n=105). Benralizumab resulted in an 80 mL (95% CI , 0 to 150, P=0.04) greater improvement in pre- bronchodilator FEV 1 after 12 weeks as compared to placebo. Despite this improvement, this lung function result does not warrant the use of benralizumab in mild to moderate asthma because it did not reach the minimum clinically important improvement of 10%. ZONDA was a randomized, multicenter, double- blind, placebo- controlled, 28- week trial that primarily assessed whether or not benralizumab was effective as an oral gl ucocorticoid- sparing therapy in patients on oral steroids to manage severe asthma associated with eosinophilia ( Nair et al 2017). Of the enrolled patients, 220 were randomly assigned to benralizumab 30 mg every 4 weeks (n=72), benralizumab 30 mg every 8 w eeks (n=73), or placebo (n=75). Results revealed that the 2 benralizumab dosing regimens significantly reduced the median final oral glucocorticoid doses from baseline by 75% vs a 25% reduction seen with placebo (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Additional ly, benralizumab administered every 4 weeks resulted in an annual exacerbation rate that was 55% lower than that seen with placebo (marginal rate, 0.83 vs 1.83; P=0.003) and benralizumab administered every 8 weeks resulted in a 70% lower rate than that seen with placebo (marginal rate, 0.54 to 1.83; P<0.001). FitzGerald et al conducted a study exploring the efficacy of benralizumab for patients with different baseline blood eosinophil thr esholds and exacerbation histories. This study was a pooled analysis (n=2295 patients) of the results from the SIROCCO and CALIMA phase 3 studies. The annual exacerbation rate among patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts of at least 0 cells/L was 1.16 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.28) in patients who received placebo versus 0.75 (0.66 to 0.84) in patients who received benralizumab every 8 weeks (RR , 0.64; 0.55 to 0.75; P<0.0001).

The extent to which exacerbation rates were reduced increased with increasing blood eosinophil thresholds and with greater exacerbation history in patients in the every 4 week and every 8 week benralizumab groups. Greater improvements in the annual exacerbation rate were seen with benralizumab compared with placebo for patients with a combination of high blood eosinophil thresholds and a history of more frequent exacerbations (FitzGerald et al 2018). A 2017 meta- analysis evaluated the therapeutic efficacy and safety of benralizumab in patients with eosinophilic asthma. A total of 7 articles (n=2321) met the inclusion criteria of the sy stematic review. The pooled analysis found that benralizumab (RR to 0.76 ; P<0.00001) compared to placebo. There was no statistical trend for improvement in FEV 1 or asthma control indices such as Quali ty of Life Assessment (AQLQ) and Asthma Control Questionnaire score in benralizumab- treated patients. In addition, safety data indicated that benralizumab administration resulted no increasing incidence of adverse events and was well tolerated (RR , 1.00; 95% CI, . MEPOLIZUMAB Asthma The safety and efficacy of mepolizumab were evaluated in 3 double- blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter, randomized controlled trials in adolescent and adult patients with severe refractory asthma and signs of eosinophilic inflammation. Generally, patients were eligible for enrollment in the trials if they had e osinophils 150 cells/L in the peripheral blood at screening or 300 cells/L at some time during the previous year. Patients also were required to be on a high- dose ICS as well as another controller medication ( Pavord et al 2012, Ortega et al 2014, Bel e t al 2014) . DREAM was a dose- ranging, 52-week , Phase 2b/3 study (N=621) that compared annual asthma exacerbation frequency and improvements in clinical symptoms between patients receiving 75 mg, 250 mg, and 750 mg intravenous (IV) mepolizumab and placebo. Mepolizumab decreased clinically significant exacerbation rates across all doses compared to placebo, at a rate of 2.40 per patient per year in the placebo group, 1.24 in the 75 mg mepolizumab group (P<0.0001), 1.46 in the 250 mg mepolizumab group (P=0.0005), and 1.15 in the 750 mg mepolizumab group (P<0.0001). No significant improvements were found for secondary clinical symptom measures, which included change in pre- bronchodilator FEV 1 from baseline, or change in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores (Pavord et al 2012) . MENSA was a 32- week Phase 3 trial (N=576) that compared annual asthma exacerbation frequency and improvements in clinical symptoms between patients receiving SC and IV mepolizumab vs placebo. Patients were selected on the basis of frequent exacerbations, treatment with high doses of ICS, and a defined blood eosinophil count. Both SC and IV mepolizumab significantly decreased clinically significant exacerbation rates compared to placebo, at a rate of 1.74 per patient per year in the plac ebo group, 0.93 per patient per year in the IV mepolizumab group (P<0.001), and 0.83 per patient per year in the SC mepolizumab group (P<0.001). In both the SC and IV mepolizumab- treated groups, the ACQ scores met thresholds for minimal clinically important change and were significantly improved compared to placebo (P<0.001) ( Ortega et al 2014) . SIRIUS was a 24 -week Phase 3 trial (N=135) that compared oral corticosteroid requirements between patients receiving SC mepolizumab and placebo. The likelihood of a reduction in the daily oral glucocorticoid dose was 2.39 times higher in the mepolizumab group (95% CI, 1.25 to 4.56; P=0.008). The median reduction in daily oral corticosteroid dose was 50% (95% CI, 20 to 75) in the mepolizumab- treated group compared to 0% (95% CI, - 20 to 33.3) in the placebo group (P=0.007) ( Bel et al 2014) . A post -hoc analysis of data from DREAM and MENSA was conducted to assess the relationship between baseline blood eosinophil counts and efficacy of mepolizumab. Of 1,192 patients, 846 received mepolizumab and 346 received placebo. The overall rate of mean exacerbations per person per year was reduced from 1.91 with placebo to 1.01 with mepolizumab (47% reduction; rate The exacerbation rate with mepolizumab vs placebo progressively from 52% ( rate ratio , 0.48; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.58) in patients with a baseline blood eosinophil count of 150 cells/L to 70% ( rate ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.40) in patients with a baseline count of 500 cells/L. At a baseline count <150 cells/L, predicted efficacy of mepolizumab was reduced. The authors concluded that the use of a baseline blood eosinophil count will help to select patients who are likely to achieve important asthma outcom es with mepolizumab ( Ortega et al 2016). COSMOS was a 52- week, open- label extension study in patients who received mepolizumab or placebo in MENSA or SIRIUS. Patients received SC mepolizumab regardless of prior treatment allocation and continued to receive Data as of June 26, 2018 AS/KA L Page 56 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

In total, 558 (86%; previous mepolizumab: 358; previous placebo: 200) and 94 (14%; previous mepolizumab: 58; previous placebo: 36) patients experienced on- treatment adverse events and serious adverse events, respectively. No fatal adverse events or instances of mepolizumab- related anaphylaxis were reported. Mepolizumab treatment was shown to exert a durable response, with patients who previously received mepolizumab in MENSA or SIRIUS maintaining reductions in exacerbation rate and oral corticosteroid dosing throughout COSMOS. Patients who previously received placebo in MENSA or SIRIUS demonstrated improvements in these endpoints following treatment with mepolizumab ( Lugogo et al 2016). A systematic review and meta- analys is compared hospitalization or hospitalization and/or emergency room visit rates in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma treated with mepolizumab or placebo in addition to standard of care for at least 24 weeks. Four studies (N=1, 388) were eligible for inclusion. Mepolizumab significantly reduced the rate of exacerbations requiring hospitalization ( relative rate, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.73 P<0.001) vs placebo. Significant reductions of 45% and 38% were also observed for the proportion of patients experiencing 1 or more hospitalization and hospitalization and/or emergency room visit, respectively ( Yancey et al 201 parallel -group, multicenter, Phase 3 trial assessed the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab as add- on therapy (to glucocorticoid treatment, with or without immunosuppressive therapy) for patients with relapsing or refractory EGPA ( Wechsler et al 2017). A total of 136 patients were randomly assigned to mepolizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks (n=68) or placebo (n=68). Results demonstrated the following for the mepolizumab and placebo gr oups, respectively: Percentage of patients with 24 weeks of accrued 28% vs P<0.001) . Percentage of patients in remission at both week 36 and week 48: 32% vs 3% (OR, 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.70; P<0.001). Percentage of patients able to reduce their daily dose of concomitant prednisone or prednisolone to 4 mg or less (average of weeks 48 to 52): 44% vs RESLIZUMAB Asthma The safety and efficacy of reslizumab were evaluated in 4 double- blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter, randomized controlled trials. In all 4 studies, patients were required to be on at least a medium -dose ICS with or without additional controller medications ( Bjermer et al 2016, Castro et al 2015, Corren et al 2016). Studies 3082 and 3083 were 52- week studies (N=953) in patients with asthma wh o were required to have a blood eosinophil count 400 cells/L, and at least 1 asthma exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroid use over the past 12 months. These studies compared the asthma exacerbation rate and improvements in clinical symptoms betw een patients receiving reslizumab 3 mg/kg IV administered once every 4 weeks and placebo. In both studies, patients receiving reslizumab had a significant reduction in the frequency of asthma exacerbations (Study 3082: rate ratio , 0.50; 95% 0.67; 3083: 0.41; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.59; both P<0.0001) compared with those receiving placebo. In both trials, an improvement in FEV 1 was evident for reslizumab vs placebo by the first on- treatment assessment at week 4, which was sustained through week 52. Reslizumab treatment also resulted in significant improvements compared with placebo in AQLQ total score, ACQ -7 score, and Asthma Symptom Utility Index (ASUI) score ( Castro et al 2015). Study 3081 was a 16- week study (N=315) in patients who were required to have a blood eosinophil count 400 cells/L. The study compared the change from baseline in FEV 1 and improvements in clinical symptoms between reslizumab 3 mg/kg vs placebo. Reslizumab 3 mg/kg significantly improved FEV 1 (difference vs mL; 95% CI, 60 to 259; P=0.0018). Reslizumab statistically significantly improved ACQ and AQLQ; however, the minimally important difference was only reached for AQLQ ( Bjermer et al 2016). Study 3084 was a 16- week study in 496 patients unselected for baseline blood eosinophil levels (approximately 80% of patients had a screening blood eosinophil count <400 cells/L). Patients were not allowed to be on maintenance oral corticosteroids. The study compared the change from baseline in FEV 1 and improvements in clinical symptoms between reslizumab 3 mg/kg vs placebo.

In the subgroup wit h eosinophils 400 cells/L, however, treatment with reslizumab was associated with much larger improvements in FEV 1, ACQ, and rescue SABA use compared with placebo ( Corren et al 2016). A 2017 meta- analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials comparing resli zumab to placebo (N=1,366) revealed improvements in exacerbations, FEV 1, and ACQ score with reslizumab. Asthma exacerbations occurred less frequently in reslizumab patients vs placebo (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.59; P<0.00001). FEV 1 also improved with res lizumab compared to placebo (mean difference, 0.16; 95% CI , 0.10 to 0.23; P<0.00001). Finally, ACQ score improved with reslizumab compared to placebo (mean difference, - 0.26; 95% CI , -0.36 to - 0.16; P<0.00001). All studies included in the meta- analysis wer e of limited duration of 15 or 16 weeks ( Li et al 2017).

COMPARATIVE REVIEWS In 2017, Cockle et al conducted a systematic review and indirect treatment comparison to assess the comparative effectiveness and tolerability of mepolizumab and omalizumab, as add- on therapy to standard of care, in patients with severe asthma. Studies included in the primary analysis were double- blind, randomized controlled trials, 12 weeks' duration enrolling patients with severe asthma with a documented exacerbation hist ory and receiving a high -dose ICS plus 1 additional controller. Two populations were examined: patients potentially eligible for 1) both treatments (overlap population) and 2) either treatment (trial population) ( Cockle et al 2017). For the overlap popul ation, no difference was found between mepolizumab and omalizumab. However, trends in favor of mepolizumab were observed, with median estimated rate ratios of 0.66 (95% credible interval [CrI], 0.37 to 1.19) for the rate of clinically significant exacerbat ions and 0.19 (95% CrI, 0.02 to 2.32) for the rate of exacerbations requiring hospitalization. Results of the trial population analysis showed that mepolizumab was associated with an estimated median rate ratio of 0.63 (95% CrI, 0.45 to 0.89) corresponding to a reduction of 37% in the rate of clinically significant exacerbations vs omalizumab. No difference between treatments was observed for the rate of exacerbations resulting in hospitalization; however, the median rate ratio of 0.58 (95% CrI, 0.16 to 2.13) demonstrated a trend for mepolizumab over omalizumab. Both treatments had broadly comparable effects on lung function, and similar tolerability profiles. Another 2017 systematic review was unable to detect differences in efficacy when comparing add- on therapy with mepolizumab or omalizumab in asthma patient s who were not well controlled on ICS therapy. The analysis included both randomized controlled trials and cohort studies with a duration of 12 weeks. A total of 18 omalizumab studies (N=4854) and 4 m epolizumab studies (N=1620) were included. Network meta- analysis did not find a significant difference in FEV 1 between groups (mean difference, 9.3 mL in favor of mepolizumab; 95% CI, - 67.7 to 86.3). Both omalizumab and mepolizumab reduced the annualized r ates of asthma exacerbations by approximately 50% compared with placebo. Although the authors were unable to identify significant differences in efficacy there was high heterogeneity among the clinical trials and major differences in study inclusion criter ia (Nachef et al 2017) . A systematic review of the IL- 5 antagonists, mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab, included 13 studies (N= 6000) conducted in patients with asthma poorly controlled by ICS . The majority of patients had severe eosinophilic asthma. All of the IL- 5 antagonists reduced asthma exacerbations by approximately 50% and improved FEV 1 by 0.08 L to 0.11 L. Overall, there was no t an increase in serious adverse events with any IL- 5 antagonist; however, more patients discontinued benraliz umab (36/1599) than placebo (9/998) due to adverse events (Farne et al 2017) . CLINICAL GUIDELINES Asthma According to guidelines from the NHLBI/National Asthma Education and Prevention Program, pharmacologic therapy is based on a stepwise approach in whic h medications are increased until asthma is controlled and then decreased when possible to minimize side effects of treatments. The level of asthma control is based on (NHLBI 2007) : Reported symptoms over the past 2 to 4 weeks Current level of lung functio n (FEV 1 and FEV 1/forced vital capacity [FVC] values) Number of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids per year. The NHLBI guidelines state that omalizumab is used as adjunctive therapy in patients 12 years and older who have allergies and severe per sistent asthma that is not adequately controlled with the combination of high- dose ICS and LABA therapy ( NHLBI 2007 ). In 2018, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) published updated guidelines for asthma management and prevention. For patients with sev ere asthma uncontrolled on Step 4 treatment (e.g., 2 or more controllers plus as -needed reliever medication), phenotyping into categories such as severe allergic, aspirin- exacerbated or eosinophilic asthma is suggested. Anti -IgE treatment with omalizumab i s recommended as the preferred option for the management of patients at Step 5 of treatment. Similarly, add- on anti-IL-5 therapy (i.e., benralizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab) is recommended for patients aged 12 years with severe eosinophilic asthma that is uncontrolled on Step 4 treatment (GINA 2018) .

Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria Guidelines developed by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology recommend a stepwise treatment approach for CIU. Treatment with omalizumab is recommended in patients inadequately controlled with antihistamines and a leukotriene receptor antagon ist (Bernstein et al 2014) . Updated joint guidelines by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network, the European Dermatology Forum, and the World Allergy Organization recommend treatment with omalizumab, cyclosporine, or a leukotriene receptor antagonist in patients with symptoms despite treatment with a 4- fold dose of modern second generation antihistamines ( Zuberbier et al 2013). Recent guidelines published by the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology similarly recommend omalizumab as a potential second- line agent in patients inadequately controlled on a 4- fold dose of a non- sedat ing antihistamine (Powell et al 2015). Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis Both the EGPA (Churg- Strauss) Consensus Task Force r ecommendations and the American Society for Apheresis guideline recommend glucocorticoids alone for patients without life- and/or organ- threatening EG PA. For patients with life- and/or organ- threatening EG PA, both gluc ocorticoids and an immunosuppressant are recommended, as well as maintenance therapy with azathioprine or methotrexate. I VIG can be considered for refractory EG PA or for treatment during pregnancy ( Groh et al 2015, Schwartz et al 2016). These guidelines have not been updated to include the place in therapy for mepolizumab; however, the EGPA Consensus Task Force recommendations notes that mepolizumab hold promise for this condition based on the pilot studies available at the time of guideline development ( Groh et al 2015) . SAFETY SUMMARY Cinqair: Contraindication: History of hypersensitivity to Cinqair or excipients in the formulation. Boxed warning: Anaphylaxis has been observed with Cinqair infusion in 0.3% of patients in placebo- controlled clinical studies. Anaphylaxis was reported as early as the second dose of Cinqair . Patients should be observed for an appropriate period of time after Cinqair administration by a healthcare professional prepared to manage anaphylaxis. Key warning and precaution: In placebo- controlled clinical studies, 6/1028 (0.6%) patients receiving 3 mg/kg Cinqair had 1 malignant neoplasm reported compared to 2/730 (0.3%) patients in the placebo group. The observed mali gnancies in Cinqair -treated patients were diverse in nature and without clustering of any particular tissue type. The most common adverse reaction (2%) includes oropharyngeal pain. Fasenra: Contraindication: History of hypersensitivity to Fasenra or pients in the formulation. (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, occurred after administration of Fasenra. Fasenra should be discontinued in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction. Systemic or inhaled corticosteroids should not be discontinued abruptly upon initiation of therapy with Fasenra. Corticosteroids should be decreased gradually, if appropriate. Pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before therapy with Fasenra. If patients become infected while receiving Fasenra and do not respond to anti -helminth treatment, Fasenra should be discontinued until the parasitic infection resolves. The most common adverse reactions (5%) include headache and pharyngitis. Nucala: Contraindication: History of hypersensitivity to Nucala or excipients in the formulation. Key reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, urticaria, rash) have occurred after administration of Nucala.

Patients should always seek the advice of a phys ician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Herpes zoster infections have occurred in patients receiving Nucala . In controlled clinical trials, 2 serious adverse reactions of herpes zoster occurred in patients treated with Nucala compared with none in patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse reactions (5%) include headache, injection site reaction, back pain, and fatigue. Xolair: Contraindication: Severe hypersensitivity reaction to Xolair or any and/or angioedema of the throat or tongue, has been reported. Observe patients closely for an appropriate period of time after Xolair administration. Health care providers administer ing Xolair should be prepared to manage anaphylaxis that can be life- threatening. Patients with a prior history of anaphylactic reactions to other causes may be at an increased risk for anaphylaxis. The frequency of anaphylaxis is reported to be between 0. 1 to 0.2% and may occur immediately or up to a year post - treatment. Key warnings and precautions: Malignant neoplasms were observed in a higher rate of Xolair -treated patients (0.5%) than control patients (0.2%) in clinical trials. A subsequent 5 -year obs ervational cohort study found similar rates of primary malignancies in Xolair - and non- Xolair -treated patients. However, study limitations preclude definitively ruling out a malignancy risk with Xolair (Long et al 2014). Rarely, patients on therapy with Xo lair may present with serious systemic eosinophilia, which may present with features of vasculitis consistent with Churg- Strauss syndrome. These events usually have been associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Some patients have repor ted signs and symptoms similar to serum sickness, including arthritis/arthralgia, rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy. Adverse reactions in asthma studies: In patients 12 years of age, the most commonly observed adverse reactions in clinical studies (1% in Xolair -treated patients and more frequently than reported with placebo) were arthralgia, pain (general), leg pain, fatigue, dizziness, fracture, arm pain, pruritus, dermatitis, and earache. In clinical studies with pediatric patients 6 to <12 years of age, the most common adverse reactions were nasopharyngitis, headache, pyrexia, upper abdominal pain, streptococcal pharyngitis, otitis media, bites, and epistaxis. reactions in CIU studies: Adverse reactions from 3 placebo- controlled, multiple- dose CIU studies that occurred in 2% of patients receiving Xolair and more frequently than in those receiving placebo included arthralgia, cough, headache, nasopharyngitis, nausea, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, an d viral upper respiratory tract infection. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in asthma studies: In a 5- year observational cohort study, a higher incidence of overall cardiovascular and cerebrovascular serious adverse events was observed in Xolair -treated patients compared to non- Xolair -treated patients. To further evaluate the risk, a pooled analysis of 25 randomized, controlled, clinical trials was conducted. An increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular serious adverse events was not not ed, but the low number of events, the young patient population, and the short duration of follow -up prevent a definite conclusion about the absence of a risk ( FDA 2014).

CONCLUSION Xolair is a humanized monoclonal antibody that is FDA -approved for patients 6 years of age and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with an ICS. Xolair has been shown to decrease the incidence of asthma exacerbations in these patients. Although clinical trial results have been mixed and several trials had an open- label design, there is some evidence to indicate that Xolair may decrease asthma- related emergency visits and hospitalizations, as well as decreasing the dose of ICS and rescue medication and increasing symptom -free days ( Buhl et al 2002, Busse et al 2011, Holgate et al 2004, Lanier et al 2003, Sol\u00e8r et al 2011). Xolair is administered SC in a physician's office every 2 to 4 weeks in a dose that is determined by body weight and the levels of serum IgE. Xolair carries a boxed warning due to the risk of anaphylaxis, and thus must be administered under medical supervision. Although Xolair therapy is generally safe, analysis of a 5- year, observational cohort, epidemiological study (EXCELS) showed an increased number of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular adverse events in patients receiving Xolair compared to placebo ( Iribarren et al 2017). However, a pooled analysis of 25 randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled clinical trials did not find notable imbalances in the rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular serious adverse events ( FDA 2014). Asthma guidelines generally recommend Xolair therapy in patients with severe allergic asthma that is inadequately controlled with a combination of high- dose ICS and LABA ( GINA 2018, NHLB I 2007). Based on the limited place in therapy and the need for administration under medical supervision, Xolair is appropriate for a small percentage of patients with asthma. Xolair received FDA -approval for the treatment of adults and adolescents (12 years of age and above) with CIU who remain symptomatic despite H 1-antihistamine treatment. Two randomized, placebo- controlled trials demonstrated its efficacy in reducing weekly itch severity scores and weekly hive count scores significantly greater than placebo at week 12. Xolair was well -tolerated, with a safety profile similar to t hat observed in asthma patients. In patients with CIU, Xolair is dosed at 150 or 300 mg SC every 4 weeks in a physician's office. Guidelines for the treatment of CIU generally recommend treatment with Xolair in patients who are inadequately controlled wit h a 4- fold dose of modern second Data as of June 26, 2018 AS/KA L Page 62 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Cinqair , Fasenra , and Nucala are IL- 5 antagonists approved as add- on treatment options for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, with demonstrated effectiveness in reducing asthma exacerbations ( Bel et al 2014, Bjermer et al 2016 , Castro et al 2015 , Corren et al 2016 , Pavord et al 2012, Ortega et al 2014 , Bleecker et al 2016, Fitzgerald et al 2016). The mechanism of action of Fasenra is slightly different, in that it binds to the IL- 5 receptor on immune effector cells, whereas Cinqair and Nucala bind to the IL- 5 cytokine. All of t hese agents provide a more targeted treatment option for patients with severe, refractory asthma and should be considered in those with an eosinophilic phenotype uncontrolled on conventional asthma therapy ( GINA 2018). Nucala is the only IL- 5 antagonist ap proved for the treatment of adult patients with EGPA. There are no head- to-head trials comparing Cinqair , Fasenra, and Nucala . However, a systematic review of the IL- 5 antagonists conducted in patients with asthma poorly controlled by ICS revealed that all of the IL- 5 antagonists reduced asthma exacerbations by approximately 50% and improved FEV 1 by 0.08 L to 0.11 L. Overall, there was not an increase in serious adverse events with any IL- 5 antagonist; however, more patients discontinued benralizumab (36/1599) than placebo (9/998) due to adverse events (Farne al 2017) . Compared to Nucala and Fasenra, Cinqair does have several limitations, including: an indication for patients aged 18 years and older (12 years and older for Nucala and Fasenra), IV administration (SC for Nucala and Fasenra), and a boxed warning for anaphylaxis.
