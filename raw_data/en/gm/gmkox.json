EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This guideline updates and replaces the previ- ous edition of the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) \"Guideline for Infection Controlin Hospital Personnel,\" published in 1983. Therevised guideline, designed to provide methodsfor reducing the transmission of infections frompatients to health care personnel and from per-sonnel to patients, also provides an overview ofthe evidence for recommendations consideredprudent by consensus of the Hospital InfectionControl Practices Advisory Committee members. A working draft of this guideline was alsoreviewed by experts in infection control, occupa-tional health, and infectious diseases; however, allrecommendations contained in the guideline maynot reflect the opinion of all reviewers. This document focuses on the epidemiology of and preventive strategies for infections known tobe transmitted in health care settings and thosefor which there are adequate scientific data onwhich to base recommendations for prevention.5.

Infection control issues for health care personnel: An overviewThe prevention strategies addressed in this docu- ment include immunizations for vaccine-pre-ventable diseases, isolation precautions to pre-vent exposures to infectious agents, managementof health care personnel exposure to infected per-sons, including postexposure prophylaxis, andwork restrictions for exposed or infected healthcare personnel. In addition, because latex barri-ers are frequently used to protect personnelagainst transmission of infectious agents, thisguideline addresses issues related to latex hyper-sensitivity and provides recommendations to pre-vent sensitization and reactions among healthcare personnel. B. INTRODUCTION In the United States, there are an estimated 8.8 million persons who work in health care profes-sions and about 6 million persons work in morethan 6000 hospitals. However, health care isincreasingly being provided outside hospitals infacilities such as nursing homes, freestanding sur-gical and outpatient centers, emergency care clin-ics, and in patients' homes or during prehospitalemergency care. Hospital-based personnel andpersonnel who provide health care outside hospi-tals may acquire infections from or transmitinfections to patients, other personnel, householdmembers, or other community contacts. 1,2 In this document, the term health care person- nelrefers to all paid and unpaid persons work- ing in health care settings who have the poten-tial for exposure to infectious materials, includ-ing body substances, contaminated medicalsupplies and equipment, contaminated environ-mental surfaces, or contaminated air. Thesepersonnel may include but are not limited toemergency medical service personnel, dentalpersonnel, laboratory personnel, autopsy per-sonnel, nurses, nursing assistants, physicians,technicians, therapists, pharmacists, studentsand trainees, contractual staff not employed bythe health care facility, and persons not directlyinvolved in patient care but potentially exposedto infectious agents (e.g., clerical, dietary,housekeeping, maintenance, and volunteer per-sonnel). In general, health care personnel in oroutside hospitals who have contact withpatients, body fluids, or specimens have a high-er risk of acquiring or transmitting infectionsthan do other health care personnel who haveonly brief casual contact with patients and theirenvironment (e.g., beds, furniture, bathrooms,food trays, medical equipment).Throughout this document, terms are used to describe routes of transmission of infections.These terms have been fully described in the\"Guideline for Isolation Precautions inHospitals.\" 3They are summarized as follows: direct contact refers to body surface-to-body sur- face contact and physical transfer of microorgan-isms between a susceptible host and an infectedor colonized person (e.g., while performing oralcare or procedures); indirect contact refers to con- tact of a susceptible host with a contaminatedobject (e.g., instruments, hands); droplet contact refers to conjunctival, nasal, or oral mucosa con-tact with droplets containing microorganismsgenerated from an infected person (by coughing,sneezing, and talking, or during certain proce-dures such as suctioning and bronchoscopy) thatare propelled a short distance; airborne transmis- sion refers to contact with droplet nuclei contain- ing microorganisms that can remain suspended inthe air for long periods or to contact with dustparticles containing an infectious agent that canbe widely disseminated by air currents; and, final-ly, common vehicle transmission refers to contact with contaminated items such as food, water,medications, devices, and equipment. In 1983 the CDC published the \"Guideline for Infection Control in Hospital Personnel.\" 4The document focused on the prevention of infec-tions known to be transmitted to and fromhealth care personnel. This revision of the guide-line has been expanded to include (a) recom-mendations for non-patient care personnel, bothin and outside hospitals, (b) management ofexposures, (c) prevention of transmission ofinfections in microbiologic and biomedical labo-ratories, and, because of the common use oflatex barriers to prevent infections, (d) preven-tion of latex hypersensitivity reactions. As in the1983 guideline, readers are frequently referred tothe \"Guideline for Isolation Precautions inHospitals\" 3and other published guidelines and recommendations for precautions that healthcare personnel may use when caring for patientsor handling patient equipment or specimens. 5,6 C. INFECTION CONTROL OBJECTIVES FOR A PERSONNEL HEALTH SERVICE The infection control objectives of the person- nel health service should be an integral part of ahealth care organization's general program forinfection control. The objectives usually includethe following: (a) educating personnel about theprinciples of infection control and stressing indi-AJIC 292 CDC Personnel Health Guideline June 1998AJIC Volume 26, Number 3 CDC Personnel Health Guideline 293 vidual responsibility for infection control, (b) col- laborating with the infection control departmentin monitoring and investigating potentially harm-ful infectious exposures and outbreaks amongpersonnel, (c) providing care to personnel forwork-related illnesses or exposures, (d) identify-ing work-related infection risks and institutingappropriate preventive measures, and (e) contain-ing costs by preventing infectious diseases thatresult in absenteeism and disability. These objec-tives cannot be met without the support of thehealth care organization's administration, med-ical staff, and other health care personnel.Documents that provide more detailed informa-tion regarding infection control issues for person-nel health are listed in Appendix A. D. ELEMENTS OF A PERSONNEL HEALTH SERVICE FOR INFECTION CONTROL Certain elements are necessary to attain the infection control goals of a personnel health ser-vice: (a) coordination with other departments, (b)medical evaluations, (c) health and safety educa-tion, (d) immunization programs, (e) manage-ment of job-related illnesses and exposures toinfectious diseases, including policies for workrestrictions for infected or exposed personnel, (f)counseling services for personnel on infectionrisks related to employment or special conditions,and (g) maintenance and confidentiality of per-sonnel health records. The organization of a personnel health service may be influenced by the size of the institution,the number of personnel, and the services offered.To ensure that contractual personnel who are notpaid by the health care facility receive appropriatepersonnel health services, contractual agreementswith their employers should contain provisionsconsistent with the policies of the facility that usesthose employees. Personnel with specializedtraining and qualifications in occupational healthcan facilitate the provision of effective services. 1. Coordination with other departments For infection control objectives to be achieved, the activities of the personnel health service mustbe coordinated with infection control and otherappropriate departmental personnel. This coordi-nation will help ensure adequate surveillance ofinfections in personnel and provision of preven-tive services. Coordinating activities will also helpto ensure that investigations of exposures and out-breaks are conducted efficiently and preventivemeasures implemented promptly.2. Medical evaluations Medical evaluations before placement can ensure that personnel are not placed in jobs thatwould pose undue risk of infection to them, otherpersonnel, patients, or visitors. An important com-ponent of the placement evaluation is a healthinventory. This usually includes determiningimmunization status and obtaining histories ofany conditions that might predispose personnel toacquiring or transmitting communicable diseases.This information will assist in decisions aboutimmunizations or postexposure management. A physical examination, another component of the medical evaluation, can be used to screenpersonnel for conditions that might increasethe risk of transmitting or acquiring work-relat-ed diseases and can serve as a baseline fordetermining whether future diseases are workrelated. However, the cost-effectiveness of rou-tine physical examinations, including laborato-ry testing (such as complete blood cell counts,serologic tests for syphilis, urinalysis, and chestradiographs) and screening for enteric or otherpathogens for infection control purposes, hasnot been demonstrated. Conversely, screeningfor some vaccine-preventable diseases, such measles, vari-cella, may be cost-effective. In general, thehealth inventory can be used to guide decisionsregarding physical examinations or laboratorytests. However, some local public health ordi-nances may mandate that certain screeningprocedures be used. Periodic evaluations may be done as indicat- ed for job reassignment, for ongoing programs(e.g., TB screening), or for evaluation of work-related problems. 3. Personnel health and safety education Personnel are more likely to comply with an infection control program if they understand itsrationale. Thus, personnel education is a cardinalelement of an effective infection control program.Clearly written policies, guidelines, and proce-dures ensure uniformity, efficiency, and effectivecoordination of activities. However, because therisk of infection varies by job category, infectioncontrol education should be modified accordingly.In addition, some personnel may need specializededucation on infection risks related to theiremployment and on preventive measures that willreduce those risks. Furthermore, educationalmaterials need to be appropriate in content andvocabulary to the educational level, literacy, andAJIC 294 CDC Personnel Health Guideline June 1998 Table 1A.

The training should comply with existing federal, state, and local reg-ulations regarding requirements for employeeeducation and training. All health care personnelneed to be educated about the organization'sinfection control policies and procedures. 4. Immunization programs Ensuring that personnel are immune to vac- cine-preventable diseases is an essential part ofsuccessful personnel health programs. Optimaluse of vaccines can prevent transmission of vac-cine-preventable diseases and eliminate unneces-sary work restriction. Prevention of illnessthrough comprehensive personnel immunizationprograms is far more cost-effective than casemanagement and outbreak control. Mandatoryimmunization programs, which include bothnewly hired and currently employed persons, aremore effective than voluntary programs in ensur-ing that susceptible persons are vaccinated. 7 National guidelines for immunization of and postexposure prophylaxis for health care person-nel are provided by the U.S. Public HealthService's Advisory Committee on ImmunizationPractices (ACIP; Table 1). 8,9ACIP guidelines also contain (a) detailed information on the epidemi-ology of vaccine-preventable diseases, (b) data onthe safety and efficacy of vaccines and immune globulin preparations, 8-22and (c) recommenda- tions for immunization of immunocompromisedpersons* (Table 2). 16,23The recommendations in this guideline have been adapted from the ACIPrecommendations. 9In addition, individual states and professional organizations have regulationsor recommendations on the vaccination of healthcare personnel. 24 Decisions about which vaccines to include in immunization programs have been made by con-sidering (a) the likelihood of personnel exposure tovaccine-preventable diseases and the potential con-sequences of not vaccinating personnel, (b) thenature of employment (type of contact with patientsand their environment), and (c) the characteristicsof the patient population within the health careorganization. Immunization of personnel beforethey enter high-risk situations is the most efficientand effective use of vaccines in health care settings. Screening tests are available to determine sus- ceptibility to certain vaccine-preventable diseasesAJIC 296 CDC Personnel Health Guideline June 1998 Table 1B.

Such screening programs need to becombined with tracking systems to ensure accu-rate maintenance of personnel immunizationrecords. Accurate immunization records ensurethat susceptible personnel are promptly identifiedand appropriately vaccinated. 5. Management of job-related illnesses and exposures Primary functions of the personnel health ser- vice are to arrange for prompt diagnosis and man-agement of job-related illnesses and to provideappropriate postexposure prophylaxis after job-related exposures. It is the responsibility of the health care orga- nization to implement measures to prevent fur-ther transmission of infection, which some-times warrants exclusion of personnel fromwork or patient contact. 25Decisions on work restrictions are based on the mode of transmis-sion and the epidemiology of the disease (Table3). The term exclude from duty in this document should be interpreted as exclusion from thehealth care facility and from health care activi-ties outside the facility. Personnel who areexcluded should avoid contact with susceptible persons both in the facility and in the commu-nity. Exclusion policies should include a state-ment of authority defining who may excludepersonnel. The policies also need to be designedto encourage personnel to report their illnessesor exposures and not to penalize them with lossof wages, benefits, or job status. Workers' com-pensation laws do not cover exclusion fromduty for exposures to infectious diseases; poli-cies therefore should include a method for pro-viding wages during the period that personnelare not able to work. In addition, exclusionpolicies must be enforceable and all personnel,especially department heads, supervisors, andnurse managers, should know which infectionsmay warrant exclusion and where to report theillnesses 24 hours a day. Health care personnelwho have contact with infectious patients out-side of hospitals also need to be included in thepostexposure program and encouraged toreport any suspected or known exposurespromptly. Notification of emergency-responsepersonnel possibly exposed to selected infec-tious disease is mandatory (1990 Ryan WhiteAct, Subtitle B, 42 USC 300ff-80).Table 2.

Primary vaccination with IPV is recommended because the risk for vaccine-associated paralysis after administration of OPV is higher amo ng adults than among chil- dren. Health care workers who have had a primary series of OPV or IPV who are directly involved with the provision of care to p atients who may be excret- ing poliovirus may receive another dose of either IPV or OPV. Any suspected case of poliomyelitis should be investigated immedi ately. If evidence suggests transmission of wild poliovirus, control measures to contain further transmission should be instituted immediately, including a n OPV vaccination campaign.AJIC Volume 26, Number 3 CDC Personnel Health Guideline 299 Table 3.

Health counseling Access to adequate health counseling for per- sonnel is another crucial element of an effectivepersonnel health service. Health counselingallows personnel to receive individually targetedinformation regarding (a) the risk and preventionof occupationally acquired infections, (b) the riskof illness or other adverse outcome after expo-sures, (c) management of exposures, including therisks and benefits of postexposure prophylaxisregimens, and (d) the potential consequences ofexposures or communicable diseases for familymembers, patients, or other personnel, bothinside and outside the health care facility. 7. Maintenance of records, data management, and confidentiality Maintenance of records on medical evaluations, immunizations, exposures, postexposure prophy-laxis, and screening tests in a retrievable, prefer-ably computerized, database allows efficient mon-itoring of the health status of personnel. Suchrecord keeping also helps to ensure that the orga-nization will provide consistent and appropriateservices to health care personnel. Individual records for all personnel should be maintained in accordance with the Occu-pational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) medical records standard, which requires the employer to retain records, main-tain employee confidentiality, and providerecords to employees when they ask to reviewthem. 26In addition, the 1991 OSHA \"Occu- pational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens;Final Rule\" 27requires employers, including health care facilities, to establish and maintainan accurate record for each employee with occu-pational exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Thestandard also requires that each employerensure that the employee medical records are(a) kept confidential, (b) not disclosed or report-ed without the employee's express written con-sent to any person within or outside the work-place, except as required by law, and (c) main-tained by the employer for at least the durationof the worker's employment plus 30 years. OSHA's record keeping regulation also requires employers to record work-related injuries and ill-nesses on the OSHA 200 log and the OSHA 101form. The records include all occupational fatali-ties, all occupational illnesses, and occupationalinjuries that result in loss of consciousness,restriction of work or motion, transfer to anotherjob, or medical treatment beyond first aid.Infectious diseases are recordable if they are workrelated and result in illness. 28Table 3.

E. EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CONTROL OF SELECTED INFECTIONS TRANSMITTEDAMONG HEALTH CARE PERSONNEL ANDPATIENTS Almost any transmissible infection may occur in the community at large or within health careorganizations and can affect both personnel andpatients. Only those infectious diseases that occurfrequently in the health care setting or are mostimportant to personnel are discussed here. 1. Bloodborne pathogens a.Overview Assessment of the risk and prevention of trans- mission of bloodborne pathogens, such as hepati-tis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), andhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV), in healthcare settings are based on information from avariety of sources, including surveillance andinvestigation of suspected cases of transmissionto health care personnel and patients, seropreva-lence surveys of health care personnel andpatients, and studies of the risk of seroconversionafter exposure to blood or other body fluids frominfected persons. In this document, the emphasisof the discussion of bloodborne pathogens will beon patient-to-personnel transmission. The CDC has periodically issued and updated recommendations for prevention of transmissionof bloodborne pathogens in health care settings;these provide detailed information and guid-ance. 30-40Also, in 1991 OSHA published a blood- borne pathogen standard that was based on theconcept of universal precautions to prevent occu-pational exposure to bloodborne pathogens. 27The use of standard precautions (which incorporatesuniversal precautions), including appropriatehandwashing and barrier precautions, will reducecontact with blood and body fluids. 3,30,31,41The use of engineering controls (e.g., safety devices) andchanges in work practices (e.g., techniques toreduce handling of sharp instruments) can reducethe frequency of percutaneous injuries. 41,42In set- tings such as the operating room, changes ininstrument design and techniques for performing surgical procedures and modified personal barri-ers have been shown to reduce blood contacts. 43,44 Despite adherence to standard precautions andimplementation of some new techniques anddevices, percutaneous injuries continue to occur.This is of concern because percutaneous injuriesrepresent the greatest risk of transmission ofbloodborne pathogens to health care personnel. 45 Only a few studies evaluating a limited number ofsafety devices have demonstrated a reduction inpercutaneous injuries among health care work-ers. 46,47This document will not address the use of safety devices, because the Public Health Serviceis assessing the need for further guidance onselection, implementation, and evaluation of suchdevices in health care settings. The risk posed to patients by health care per- sonnel infected with bloodborne pathogens suchas HBV and HIV has been the subject of muchconcern and debate. There are no data to indi-cate that infected workers who do not performinvasive procedures pose a risk to patients.Consequently, work restrictions for these work-ers are not appropriate. However, the extent towhich infected workers who perform certaintypes of invasive procedures pose a risk topatients and the restrictions that should beimposed on these workers have been much morecontroversial. In 1991, CDC recommendationson this issue were published. 48Subsequently, Congress mandated that each state implementthe CDC guidelines or equivalent as a conditionfor continued federal public health funding tothat state. Although all states have complied withthis mandate, there is a fair degree of state-to-state variation regarding specific provisions.Local or state public health officials should becontacted to determine the regulations or rec-ommendations applicable in a given area. CDC iscurrently in the process of reviewing relevantdata regarding health care personnel-to-patienttransmission of bloodborne pathogens. b.Hepatitis B Nosocomial transmission of HBV is a serious risk for health care personnel.49-53Approximately 1000 health care personnel were estimated tohave become infected with HBV in 1994. This90% decline since 1985 is attributable to the useof vaccine and adherence to other preventive mea-sures (e.g., standard precautions). 54During the past decade, an estimated 100 to 200 health carepersonnel annually have died of occupationallyacquired HBV infection. 54The risk of acquiringAJIC 302 CDC Personnel Health Guideline June 1998AJIC Volume 26, Number 3 CDC Personnel Health Guideline 303 HBV infection from occupational exposure is dependent on the nature and frequency of expo-sure to blood or to body fluids containingblood. 49,53The risk of infection is at least 30% after a percutaneous exposure to blood from a hepatitisB e antigen-seropositive source. 54 HBV is transmitted by percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood and serum-derivedbody fluids from persons who have either acuteor chronic HBV infection. The incubation peri-od is 45 to 180 days (average 60 to 90 days). Anyperson seropositive for hepatitis B surface anti-gen (HBsAg) is potentially infectious. Hepatitis B vaccination of health care personnel who have contact with blood and body fluids canprevent transmission of HBV and is strongly rec-ommended. 9,10,40The OSHA bloodborne pathogen standard mandates that hepatitis B vaccine bemade available, at the employer's expense, to allhealth care personnel with occupational exposureto blood or other potentially infectious materials. 27 Provision of vaccine during training of health careprofessionals before such blood exposure occursmay both increase the vaccination rates amongpersonnel and prevent infection among trainees,who are at increased risk for unintentional injurieswhile they are learning techniques. Prevaccination serologic screening for suscepti- bility to HBV infection is not indicated for per-sons being vaccinated, unless the health careorganization considers such screening to be cost-effective. Postvaccination screening for antibodyto HBsAg (anti-HBs) is advised for personnel atongoing risk for blood exposure to determinewhether response to vaccinations has occurred and to aid in determining the appropriate postex-posure prophylaxis or the need for revaccination.Personnel who do not respond to or do not com-plete the primary vaccination series should berevaccinated with a second three-dose vaccineseries or evaluated to determine whether they areHBsAg seropositive. Revaccinated persons shouldbe tested for anti-HBs at the completion of thesecond vaccine series. 9If they do not respond, no further vaccination series should be given andthey should be evaluated for the presence ofHBsAg (possible chronic HBV infection). No spe-cific work restrictions are recommended for non-responders; in the event of percutaneous exposureto blood or body fluids, however, they should seetheir health care providers as soon as possible toevaluate the need for postexposure prophylaxis.Personnel in chronic dialysis centers who do notrespond to vaccine need to be screened for HBsAgand anti-HBs every 6 months. 55 Vaccine-induced antibodies decline gradually with time, and as many as 60% of those who ini-tially respond to vaccination will lose detectableanti-HBs by 8 years. 56Booster doses of vaccine are not routinely recommended, because per-sons who respond to the initial vaccine seriesremain protected against clinical hepatitis andchronic infection even when their anti-HBs lev-els become low or undetectable. 57 The need for postexposure prophylaxis, vacci- nation, or both depends on the HBsAg status ofthe source of the exposure as well as the immu-nization status of the person exposed (Table 4). 40Table 4.

The effectiveness of HBIG given later than7 days after HBV exposure is unknown. 8,10,40If the source is HBsAg seropositive and the exposedperson is known not to have responded to a three-dose vaccine series, a single dose of HBIG and adose of hepatitis B vaccine need to be given assoon as possible after the exposure with subse-quent vaccine doses given at 1 month and 6months after the initial dose. If the exposed per-son is known not to have responded to a three-dose vaccine series and to revaccination, twodoses of HBIG need to be given, one dose as soonas possible after exposure and the second dose 1month later. c.Hepatitis C HCV is the etiologic agent in cases of par- enterally transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis inthe United States. 58,59During the past decade, the annual number of newly acquired HCV infectionshas ranged from an estimated 180,000 in 1984 toan estimated 28,000 in 1995. Of these, an estimat-ed 2% to 4% occurred among health care person-nel who were occupationally exposed to blood. 59 A case-control study of patients with acute non-A, non-B hepatitis, conducted before theidentification of HCV, showed a significant asso-ciation between acquisition of disease andhealth care employment, specifically patientcare or laboratory work. 60Seroprevalence stud- ies among hospital-based health care personnelhave shown seroprevalence antibody toHCV (anti-HCV) ranging from 1% to 2%. 61-64In a study that assessed risk factors for infection inhealth care personnel, a history of accidentalneedlesticks was independently associated withanti-HCV seropositivity. 61 Several case reports have documented transmis- sion of HCV infection from anti-HCV-seropositivepatients to health care personnel as a result ofaccidental needlesticks or cuts with sharp instru-ments. 65,66In follow-up studies health care per- 67-70In a study in which HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction methods wereused to measure HCV infection, the rate of HCVtransmission was 10%. 70 The incubation period for hepatitis C is 6 to 7 weeks, and nearly all persons with acute infec-tion will have chronic HCV infection occur with persistent viremia and the potential for trans-mission of HCV to others. Serologic assays to detect anti-HCV are com- mercially available. The interpretation of anti-HCV test results is limited by several factors: (a)these assays will not detect anti-HCV in approxi-mately 5% of persons infected with HCV; (b) theseassays do not distinguish between acute, chronic,and past infection; (c) there may be a prolongedinterval between the onset of acute illness withHCV and seroconversion; and (d) when the assaysare used in populations with a low prevalence ofHCV infection, commercial screening assays foranti-HCV yield a high proportion (as great as50%) of false-positive results. 34,59Although no true confirmatory test has been developed, supplemen-tal tests for specificity are available and should beused to judge the validity of repeatedly reactiveresults by screening assays. Although the value of immune globulin for postexposure prophylaxis after occupationalexposure to HCV has been difficult to assess, 71-73 postexposure prophylaxis with immune globulindoes not appear to be effective in preventing HCVinfection. Current immune globulin preparationsare manufactured from plasma that has beenscreened for HCV antibody; positive lots areexcluded from use. An experimental study inchimpanzees found that administration 1 hourafter exposure to HCV of immune globulin manu-factured from anti-HCV-screened plasma did notprevent infection or disease. 74Thus, available data do not support the use of immune globulin forpostexposure prophylaxis against hepatitis C, andits use is not recommended. There is no informa-tion regarding the use of antiviral agents, such asinterferon alfa, in the postexposure setting, andsuch prophylaxis is not recommended. 37 Health care institutions should consider imple- menting recommended policies and proceduresfor follow-up for HCV infection after percuta-neous or mucosal exposures to blood. At a mini-mum, such policies can include (1) baseline test-ing of the source for anti-HCV, (2) baseline andfollow-up testing (e.g., 6 months) for anti-HCVand alanine aminotransferase activity of the per-son exposed source,(3) confirmation by supplemental anti-HCV test-ing (4) recommen-dation postexposure prophylaxis withimmune globulin or antiviral agents (e.g., inter-feron), and (5) education of health care personnelAJIC 304 CDC Personnel Health Guideline June 1998AJIC Volume 26, Number 3 CDC Personnel Health Guideline 305 about the risk for and prevention of bloodborne infections, including HCV , in occupational set-tings, with the information routinely updated toensure accuracy. 37Among health care personnel in the postexposure period, onset of HCV infec-tion may be detected earlier by measuring HCVRNA with polymerase chain reaction rather thanby measuring anti-HCV with enzyme immunoas-say. However, polymerase chain reaction is not alicensed assay, and the accuracy of the results arehighly variable. 37 d.Human immunodeficiency virus Nosocomial transmission of human immuno- deficiency virus (HIV) infection from patients tohealth care personnel may occur after percuta-neous or, infrequently, mucocutaneous exposureto blood or body fluids containing blood.According to prospective studies of health carepersonnel percutaneously exposed to HIV-infect-ed blood, the average risk for HIV infection hasbeen estimated to be 0.3%. 45,75-78A retrospective case-control study to identify risk factors for HIVseroconversion among health care personnelafter a percutaneous exposure to HIV-infectedblood found that they were more likely to becomeinfected if they were exposed to a larger quantityof blood, represented in the study as (1) presenceof visible blood on the device before injury, (2) aprocedure that involved a needle placed directlyin the patient's vein or artery, or (3) deep injury. 45 Transmission of HIV infection also was associat-ed with injuries in which the source patient wasterminally ill with AIDS; this may be attributableto the increased titer of HIV in blood that isknown to accompany late stages of illness or pos-sibly to other factors, such as the presence of syn-cytia-inducing strains of HIV in these patients. Inaddition, the findings of this study suggested thatthe postexposure use of zidovudine may be pro-tective for health care personnel. 45 Factors that determine health care personnel's risk of infection with HIV include the prevalenceof infection among patients, the risk of infectiontransmission after an exposure, and the fre-quency and nature of exposures. 79Most person- nel who acquire infection after percutaneousexposure have HIV antibody develop within 6months of exposure. HIV-infected persons arelikely to transmit virus from the time of earlyinfection throughout life. In 1990, CDC published guidelines for postex- posure management of occupational exposureto HIV, 33and provisional recommendations for postexposure chemoprophylaxis were publishedin 1996.80In 1998, both of these documents were updated and consolidated to reflect current sci-entific knowledge on the efficacy of postexpo-sure prophylaxis and the use of antiretroviraltherapies. 81The U.S. Public Health Service will periodically review scientific information onantiretroviral therapies and publish updatedrecommendations for their use as postexposureprophylaxis as necessary. 2. Conjunctivitis Although conjunctivitis can be caused by a vari- ety of bacteria and viruses, adenovirus has beenthe primary cause of nosocomial outbreaks ofconjunctivitis. Nosocomial outbreaks of conjunc-tivitis caused by other pathogens are rare. Adenoviruses, which can cause respiratory, ocular, genitourinary, and gastrointestinalinfections, are a major cause of epidemic kera-toconjunctivitis in the community and healthcare settings. Nosocomial outbreaks have pri-marily occurred in eye clinics or offices buthave also been reported in neonatal intensivecare units and long-term care facilities. 82-86 Patients and health care personnel haveacquired and transmitted epidemic keratocon-junctivitis during these outbreaks. The incuba-tion period ranges from 5 to 12 days, and shed-ding of virus occurs from late in the incubationperiod to as long as 14 days after onset of dis-ease. 83Adenovirus survives for long periods on environmental surfaces; ophthalmologic instru-ments and equipment can become contaminat-ed and transmit infection. Contaminated handsare also a major source of person-to-persontransmission of adenovirus, both from patientsto health care personnel and from health carepersonnel to patients. Handwashing, glove use,and disinfection of instruments can prevent thetransmission of adenovirus. 82,83 Infected personnel should not provide patient care for the duration of symptoms after onset ofepidemic keratoconjunctivitis 82,83or purulent con- junctivitis caused by other pathogens. Cytomegalovirus There are two principal reservoirs of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in health care institu-tions: (a) infants and young children infected withCMV and (b) immunocompromised patients, suchas those undergoing solid-organ or bone-marrowtransplantation or those with AIDS. 87-94However, personnel who provide care to such high-riskpatients have a rate of primary CMV infection thatis no higher than that among personnel without such patient contact (3% vs 2%).95-101In areas where there are patient populations with a highprevalence of CMV, seroprevalence studies andepidemiologic investigations have also demon-strated that personnel who care for patients haveno greater risk of acquiring CMV than do person-nel who have no patient contact. 92,95-98,100,102-107In addition, epidemiologic studies that includedDNA testing of viral strains have demonstratedthat personnel who acquired CMV infectionswhile providing care to CMV-infected infants hadnot acquired their infections from the CMV-infect-ed patients. 88,92,96,108-110 CMV transmission appears to occur directly either through close, intimate contact with an excreter ofCMV or through contact with contaminated secre-tions or excretions, especially saliva or urine. 101,111-114 Transmission by the hands of personnel or infectedpersons has also been suggested. 92,115The incubation period for person-to-person transmission is notknown. Although CMV can survive on environmen-tal surfaces and other objects for short periods, 116 there is no evidence that the environment plays arole in the transmission of infection. 92 Because infection with CMV during pregnancy may have adverse effects on the fetus, women ofchildbearing age need to be counseled regardingthe risks and prevention of transmission of CMVin both nonoccupational and occupational set-tings. 117Although most fetal infections follow pri- mary maternal infection, fetal infection may fol-low maternal reinfection or reactivation. 118,119 There are no studies that clearly indicate thatseronegative personnel may be protected frominfection by transfer to areas with less contactwith patients likely to be reservoirs for CMV infec-tion. 88,92,95-97,102,105,106,119,120 Serologic or virologic screening programs to identify CMV-infected patients or seronegativefemale personnel of childbearing age are imprac-tical and costly for the following reasons: (a) thevirus can be intermittently shed, 121and repeated screening tests may be needed to identify shed-ders; (b) seropositivity for CMV does not offercomplete protection against maternal reinfectionor reactivation and subsequent fetal infec-tion and available vac- cines122-125or prophylactic therapy90,126-129can pro- vide protection against primary infection. Work restrictions for personnel who contract CMV illnesses are not necessary. The risk of transmissionof CMV can be reduced by careful adherence tohandwashing and standard precautions. 3,119,1304. Diphtheria Nosocomial transmission of diphtheria among patients and personnel has been reported.131-133 Diphtheria is currently a rare disease in the UnitedStates. During 1980 through 1994, only 41 diphthe-ria cases were reported 134; however, community out- breaks of diphtheria have occurred in the past,135 and clusters of infection may occur in communitieswhere diphtheria was previously endemic. 136In addition, diphtheria epidemics have been occurringsince 1990 in the new independent states of the for-mer Soviet Union 137-139and in Thailand.140At least 20 imported cases of diphtheria have been reported incountries in Europe, 139,141and two cases occurred in U.S. citizens visiting or working in the RussianFederation and Ukraine. 142Health care personnel are not at substantially higher risk than the generaladult population for acquiring diphtheria; however,there is a potential for sporadic or imported cases torequire medical care in the United States. Diphtheria, caused by Corynebacterium diphthe- riae, is transmitted by contact with respiratory droplets or contact with skin lesions of infectedpatients. The incubation period is usually 2 to 5days. Patients with diphtheria are usually infec-tious for 2 weeks or less, but communicability canpersist for several months. 143Droplet precautions are recommended for patients with pharyngealsymptoms, and contact precautions are recom-mended for patients with cutaneous lesions.Precautions need to be maintained until antibiotictherapy is completed and results of two culturestaken at least 24 hours apart are negative. 3 Limited serosurveys conducted since 1977 in the United States indicate that 22% to 62% of adults18 to 39 years old may lack protective diphtheriaantibody levels. 144-148Prevention of diphtheria is best accomplished by maintaining high levels ofdiphtheria immunity among children andadults. 19,137,138Immunization with tetanus and diphtheria toxoid (Td) is recommended every 10years for all adults who have completed the pri-mary immunization series (Table 1). 9,19Health care personnel need to consider obtaining Td immu-nization from their health care providers. 9 To determine whether health care personnel directly exposed to oral secretions of patientsinfected with toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae are carriers, cultures of the nasopharynx may beobtained. Exposed personnel need to be evaluatedfor evidence of disease daily for 1 week. 149Although the efficacy of antimicrobial prophylaxis in pre-venting secondary disease has not been proved,prophylaxis with either a single intramuscularAJIC 306 CDC Personnel Health Guideline June 1998AJIC Volume 26, Number 3 CDC Personnel Health Guideline 307 injection of benzathine penicillin (1.2 mouse units) or oral erythromycin (1 gm/day) for 7 days hasbeen recommended. 19Follow-up nasopharyngeal cultures for C. diphtheriae need to be obtained at least 2 weeks after antimicrobial therapy is com-pleted. If the organism has not been eradicated, a10-day course of erythromycin needs to be given. 149 In addition, previously immunized exposed per-sonnel need to receive a dose of Td if they have notbeen vaccinated within the previous 5 years. 19 Exclusion from duty is indicated for personnel with C. diphtheriae infection or those determined to be asymptomatic carriers until antimicrobial ther-apy is completed and nasopharyngeal cultureresults are negative. 5. Gastrointestinal infections, acute Gastrointestinal infections may be caused by a variety of agents, including bacteria, viruses, andprotozoa. However, only a few agents have beendocumented in nosocomial transmission (Table5). 150-168Nosocomial transmission of agents that cause gastrointestinal infections usually resultsfrom contact with infected individuals,150,161,163,169 from consumption of contaminated food, water, or other beverages,150,166,169,170or from exposure to contaminated objects or environmental sur-faces. 152,153,171Airborne transmission of small round-structured viruses (Norwalk-like viruses)has been postulated but not proved. 164,165,172-175 Inadequate handwashing by health care person-nel 176and inadequate sterilization or disinfection of patient-care equipment and environmental sur-faces increase the likelihood of transmission ofagents that cause gastrointestinal infections.Generally, adherence to good personal hygiene bypersonnel before and after all contacts withpatients or food and to either standard or contactprecautions 3will minimize the risk of transmit- ting enteric pathogens.167,177 Laboratory personnel who handle infectious materials also may be at risk for occupationalacquisition of gastrointestinal infections, mostcommonly with Salmonella typhi incidence of laboratory-acquired S. typhi infec- tion has decreased substantially since 1955,Table 5.

The live-attenuated Ty21a vaccine should not be usedfor immunocompromised persons, includingthose known to be infected with HIV. 178 Personnel who acquire an acute gastroin- testinal illness (defined as vomiting, diarrhea,or both, with or without associated symptomssuch as fever, nausea, and abdominal pain) arelikely to have high concentrations of the infect-ing agent in their feces (bacteria, viruses, andparasites) or vomitus (viruses and para-sites). 165,179,180It is important to determine the etiology of gastrointestinal illness in healthcare personnel who care for patients at highrisk for severe disease (e.g., neonates, elderlypersons, and immunocompromised patients).The initial evaluation of personnel with gas-troenteritis needs to include a thorough historyand determination of the need for specific lab-oratory tests, such as stool or blood cultures,staining procedures, and serologic or antigen-antibody tests. 162,171,181,182 After resolution of some acute bacterial gas- trointestinal illnesses, some personnel mayhave persistent carriage of the infectious agent.Once the person has clinically recovered and ishaving formed stools, however, the risk of trans-mission of enteric pathogens is minimized byadherence antimicrobial Salmonella 185or Cryptosporidium . Moreover, antimicrobials may prolong excre-tion of Salmonella 186and lead to emergence of resistant strains.187However, transmission of Salmonella to patients from personnel who are asymptomatic carriers of Salmonella has not been well documented.167In general, antimicro- bial therapy is not recommended, unless theperson is at high risk for severe disease. 188 When antibiotics are given, stool culturesshould be obtained at least 48 hours after com- pletion of antibiotic therapy. Restriction from patient care and the patient's environment or from food handling isindicated for personnel with diarrhea or acutegastrointestinal symptoms, regardless of thecausative agent. 3,171Some local and state agen- cies have regulations that require work exclu-sion for health care personnel, food handlers,or both who have gastrointestinal infectionscaused by Salmonella or Shigella . These regula- tions may require such personnel to be restrict-ed from duty until results of at least two con-secutive stool cultures obtained at least 24hours apart are negative. 6. Hepatitis A Nosocomial hepatitis A occurs infrequently, and transmission to personnel usually occurswhen the source patient has unrecognizedhepatitis and is fecally incontinent or hasdiarrhea. 189-198Other risk factors for hepatitis A virus (HAV) transmission to personnelinclude activities that increase the risk offecal-oral contamination such as (a) eating ordrinking in patient care areas, 189,191,193,199(b) not washing hands after handling an infectedinfant, 191,199,200and (c) sharing food, beverages, or cigarettes with patients, their families, orother staff members. 189,191 HAV is transmitted primarily by the fecal-oral route. It has not been reported to occur afterinadvertent needlesticks or other contact withblood, but it has rarely been reported to betransmitted by transfusion of blood prod-ucts. 193,201,202The incubation period for HAV is 15 to 50 days. Fecal excretion of HAV is greatestduring the incubation period of disease beforethe onset of jaundice. 203Once disease is clini- cally obvious, the risk of transmitting infectionis decreased. However, some patients admittedto the hospital with HAV, particularly immuno-compromised patients, may still be sheddingvirus because of prolonged or relapsing disease,and such patients are potentially infective. 190,203 Fecal shedding of HAV, formerly believed tocontinue only as long as 2 weeks after onset ofdark urine, 203has been shown to occur as late as 6 months after diagnosis of infection in prema-ture infants. 189Anicteric infection is typical in young children and infants.204 Personnel can protect themselves and others from infection with HAV by adhering to stan-dard precautions. 3Food-borne transmission ofAJIC 308 CDC Personnel Health Guideline June 1998AJIC Volume 26, Number 3 CDC Personnel Health Guideline 309 hepatitis A is not discussed in this guideline, but it has occurred in health care settings.205,206 Two inactivated hepatitis A vaccines are now available and provide long-term preexposureprotection against clinical infection withgreater than 94% efficacy. 204Serologic surveys among health care personnel have not showngreater prevalence of HAV infection than incontrol populations 52,192,207,208; therefore, routine administration of vaccine in health care person-nel is not recommended. Vaccine may be usefulfor personnel working or living in areas whereHAV is highly endemic and is indicated for per-sonnel who handle HAV-infected primates orare exposed to HAV in a research laboratory.The role of hepatitis A vaccine in controllingoutbreaks has not been adequately investigat-ed. 9Immune globulin given within 2 weeks after an HAV exposure is more than 85% effec-tive in preventing HAV infection 204and may be advisable in some outbreak situations.9,204 Restriction from patient care areas or food handling is indicated for personnel with HAVinfection. They may return to regular duties 1week after onset of illness. 9 7. Herpes simplex Nosocomial transmission of herpes simplex virus transmission has beenreported in nurseries 209-211and intensive care units212,213where high-risk patients (e.g., neonates, patients with severe malnutrition, patients withsevere burns or eczema, and immunocompromisedpatients) are located. Nosocomial transmission ofHSV occurs primarily through contact either withprimary or recurrent lesions or with virus-contain-ing secretions, such as saliva, vaginal secretions, oramniotic fluid. 210,212,214Exposed areas of skin are the most likely sites of nosocomial infection, par-ticularly when minor cuts, abrasions, or other skinlesions are present. 213The incubation period of HSV is 2 to 14 days.215The duration of viral shed- ding has not been well defined.216 Personnel may acquire a herpetic infection of the fingers (herpetic whitlow or paronychia) fromexposure to contaminated oral secretions. 213,214 Such exposures are a distinct hazard for nurses,anesthesiologists, dentists, respiratory care per-sonnel, and other personnel who have direct (usu-ally hand) contact with either oral lesions or res-piratory secretions from patients. 213Less fre- quently, personnel may acquire mucocutaneousinfection on other body sites from contact withinfectious body secretions. 217Personnel with active infection of the hands (her- petic whitlow) can potentially transmit HSV infec-tion to patients with whom they have contact. 214 Transmission of HSV from personnel with orofa-cial HSV infection to patients has also been infre-quently documented 209; however, the magnitude of this risk is unknown.211,218Although asymptomatic infected persons can shed the virus, they are lessinfectious than persons with active lesions. 216,219 Personnel can protect themselves from acquiring HSV by adhering to standard precau-tions. 3The risk of transmission of HSV from personnel with orofacial infections to patientscan be reduced by handwashing before allpatient care and by the use of appropriate bar-riers, such as a mask or gauze dressing, to pre-vent hand contact with the lesion. Because personnel with orofacial lesions may touch their lesions and potentially transmit infec-tions, they should be evaluated to determine theirpotential for transmitting herpes simplex topatients at high risk for serious disease (e.g.,neonates, patients with severe malnutrition,patients with severe burns or eczema, andimmunocompromised patients) and excludedfrom the care of such patients as indicated. Theevaluation should consider the extent of thelesion and the severity of illness in the patientpopulation that personnel will contact. Personnelwith HSV infections of the fingers or hands canmore easily transmit infection and therefore needto be excluded from patient care until theirlesions have crusted. In addition, herpetic lesionsmay be secondarily infected by Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, and personnel with such infections should be evaluated to determinewhether they need to be excluded from patientcontact until the secondary infection hasresolved. There have been no reports that person-nel with genital HSV infections have transmittedHSV to patients; therefore, work restrictions forpersonnel with genital herpes are not indicated. 8. Measles Nosocomial transmission of measles virus (sporadic and epidemic) has been welldescribed. 220-229From 1985 through 1991, approx- imately 3000 (4%) of all reported episodes ofmeasles in the United States were probablyacquired in a medical facility; of these, more than700 (25%) occurred in health care personnel,many of whom were not vaccinated. 9Data have suggested that health care personnel have a riskof measles 13-fold that of the general population. 9Of the 2765 episodes of measles reported during 1992 through 1995, 385 (13.9%) occurred inhealth care settings. 221,230 Measles is transmitted both by large droplets during close contact between infected and sus-ceptible persons and by the airborne route. 229,231 Measles is highly transmissible and frequentlymisdiagnosed during the prodromal stage. Theincubation period for measles is 5 to 21 days.Immunocompetent persons with measles shedthe virus from the nasopharynx, beginning withthe prodrome until 3 to 4 days after rash onset;immunocompromised persons with measlesmay shed virus for extended periods. 232 Strategies to prevent nosocomial transmis- sion of measles include (a) documentation ofmeasles immunity in health care personnel, (b)prompt identification and isolation of personswith fever and rash, and (c) adherence to air-borne precautions for suspected and provencases of measles. 3 It is essential that all personnel have docu- mentation of measles immunity, regardless oftheir length of employment or whether they areinvolved in patient care. Further, some stateshave regulations requiring measles immunityfor health care personnel. Although personsborn before 1957 are generally considered to beimmune to measles, serologic studies indicatethat 5% to 9% of health care personnel bornbefore 1957 may not be immune. 9,233,234 Furthermore, during 1985 through 1989, 29%of all measles cases in U.S. health care person-nel occurred in those born before 1957. 221 Consideration should be given to recommend-ing a dose of measles-mumps-rubella trivalentvaccine (MMR) to personnel born before 1957who are unvaccinated and who lack (a) a histo-ry of previous measles disease, (b) documenta-tion of receipt of one dose of live-measles vac-cine, and (c) serologic evidence of measlesimmunity. 9Health care personnel born during or after 1957 should be considered immune tomeasles when they have (a) documentation ofphysician-diagnosed measles, (b) documenta-tion of two doses of live measles vaccine on orafter their first birthday, or (c) serologic evi-dence of measles immunity (persons with an\"indeterminate\" level of immunity on testingshould be considered susceptible). Personsborn between 1957 and 1984 who receivedchildhood measles immunization were givenonly one dose of vaccine during infancy andmay require a second dose of vaccine. 8Serologic screening for measles immunity is not necessary before administration of measlesvaccine, unless the medical facility considers itcost-effective or the person to be vaccinatedrequests it. 235-238When serologic screening before vaccination is done, tracking systemsare needed to ensure that those identified assusceptible are subsequently vaccinated in atimely manner. 237During measles outbreaks, serologic screening before vaccination is notnecessary. In outbreak situations, promptadministration of vaccine is necessary to haltdisease transmission. Work restrictions are necessary for personnel who acquire measles; they need to be excludedfrom duty for 7 days after the rash appears.Likewise, personnel not immune to measlesneed to be excluded from duty from 5 daysafter the first exposure to 21 days after the lastexposure to measles. 9. Meningococcal disease Community-acquired meningococcal disease is typically caused by a variety of serogroups ofNeisseria meningitidis ; serogroups B and C cause 46% and 45% of the endemic cases, respectively.Serogroups A, Y, and W-135 account for nearly allthe remaining endemic cases. 15In contrast, epidem- ic meningococcal disease has, since the early 1990s,been caused increasingly by serogroup C. 15,239,240 Nosocomial transmission of N. meningitidis is uncommon. In rare instances, when proper pre-cautions were not used, N. meningitidis has been transmitted from patient to personnel,through contact with the respiratory secretionsof patients with meningococcemia or meningo-coccal meningitis, 241-243or through handling laboratory specimens.241Lower respiratory tract infections caused by N. meningitidis may present a greater risk of transmission thaneither meningococcemia or meningitis, 243,244 especially if the patient has an active, produc-tive cough. 244The risk of personnel acquisition of meningococcal disease from casual contact(e.g., cleaning rooms or delivering food trays)appears to be negligible. 244 N. meningitidis infection is probably transmit- ted by large droplets; the incubation period isfrom 2 to 10 days, and patients infected with N. meningitidis are rendered noninfectious by 24 hours of effective therapy. Personnel who care forpatients with suspected N. meningitidis infection can decrease their risk of infection by adhering todroplet precautions. 3AJIC 310 CDC Personnel Health Guideline June 1998AJIC Volume 26, Number 3 CDC Personnel Health Guideline 311 Postexposure prophylaxis is advised for persons who have had intensive, unprotected contact (i.e.,without wearing a mask) with infected patients(e.g., mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, prevent infec- tions in personnel who have unprotected exposureto patients with meningococcal infections. 245,246 Because secondary cases of N. meningitidis occur rapidly (within the first week) after expo-sure to persons with meningococcal disease, 247it is important to begin prophylactic therapyimmediately after an intensive, unprotectedexposure, often before results of antimicrobialtesting are available. Prophylaxis administeredlater than 14 days after exposure is probably oflimited or no value. 15Rifampin (600 mg orally every 12 hours for 2 days) is effective in eradi-cating nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningi- tidis. 245Ciprofloxacin (500 mg orally) and ceftri- axone (250 mg intramuscularly) in single-doseregimens are also effective in reducing nasopha-ryngeal carriage of N. meningitidis and are rea- sonable alternatives to the multidose rifampinregimen. 15,246These antimicrobials may be useful when infections are caused by rifampin-resistantmeningococci or rifampin is contraindicated.Rifampin and ciprofloxacin are pregnant women. 15,106,248,249 The quadrivalent A,C,Y,W-135 polysaccharide vaccine has been used successfully to controlcommunity outbreaks caused by serogroupC, 15,239,240,248but its use is not recommended for postexposure prophylaxis in health care settings.15 However, preexposure vaccination may be consid-ered for laboratory personnel who routinely han-dle soluble preparations of N. meningitidis . 15,241 Healthy persons may have nasopharyngeal car- riage of N. meningitidis .245,250-252Nosocomial trans- mission from carriers to personnel has not beenreported. In the absence of exposures to patientswith N. meningitidis infection, personnel who are asymptomatic carriers need not be identified,treated, or removed from patient care activities.However, personnel with meningococcal infectionneed to be excluded from duty until 24 hours afterthe start of effective therapy. 10. Mumps Mumps transmission has occurred in hospi- tals and long-term care facilities housing adoles-cents and young adults. 253,254Most cases ofmumps in health care personnel have been com- munity acquired. Mumps is transmitted by contact with virus- containing respiratory secretions, including sali-va; the portals of entry are the nose and mouth.The incubation period varies from 12 to 25 daysand is usually 16 to 18 days. The virus may be pre-sent in saliva for 6 to 7 days before parotitis andmay persist for as long as 9 days after onset of dis-ease. Exposed personnel may be infectious for 12to 25 days after their exposure, and many infectedpersons remain asymptomatic. 255Droplet precau- tions are recommended for patients with mumps;such precautions should be continued for 9 daysafter the onset of parotitis. 3 An effective vaccination program is the best approach to prevention of nosocomial mumpstransmission. 12Vaccination with mumps virus vac- cine is recommended, unless otherwise con-traindicated, for all those who are susceptible tomumps; 12,256combined MMR is the vaccine of choice,257especially when the recipient also is like- ly to be susceptible to measles, rubella, or both. Personnel should be considered immune to mumps if they have (a) documentation of physi-cian-diagnosed mumps, (b) documentation ofreceipt of one dose of live mumps vaccine on orafter their first birthday, or (c) serologic evidenceof immunity (individuals who have an \"indeter-minate\" antibody level should be considered sus-ceptible). 12Most persons born before 1957 are likely to have been infected naturally and may beconsidered to be immune, even though they maynot have had clinically recognized mumps.Outbreaks among highly vaccinated populationshave occurred and have been attributed to pri-mary vaccine failure. 258 Work restrictions are necessary for personnel who acquire mumps; such restrictions should beimposed for 9 days after the onset of parotitis.Likewise, susceptible personnel who are exposedto mumps need to be excluded from duty from the12th day after the first exposure until the 26th dayafter the last exposure. 9,255 11. Parvovirus Human parvovirus B19 (B19) is the cause of erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), a commonrash illness that is usually acquired in childhood.Immunocompetent persons infected with B19may have an acute, self-limited arthropathy, withor without a rash or anemia of short duration.However, patients with preexisting anemia (e.g.,patients with sickle-cell anemia or thalassemia)may have aplastic crisis occur. Immunodeficient patients (e.g., patients with leukemia or AIDS)may become chronically infected with B19 andhave chronic anemia. 259,260 Transmission of B19 to health care personnel from infected patients appears to be rare but hasbeen reported. 261-265In two investigations of health care personnel exposures to B19, the rate of infec-tion among exposed nurses was not higher thanthe rate among unexposed control subjects. 266,267 In another investigation of health care personnelexposed to a patient with undetected chronic B19infection, none of the susceptible employeesbecame infected. 268Personnel have acquired infection while working in laboratories or duringthe care of patients with B19-associated sickle-cellaplastic crises. 263-265,269-271 B19 may be transmitted through contact with infected persons, fomites, or large droplets.266,272,273 The incubation period is variable, depending onthe clinical manifestation of disease, and rangesfrom 6 to 10 days. 260The period of infectivity also varies, depending on the clinical presentation orstage of disease. Persons with erythema infectio-sum are infectious before the appearance of therash, those with infection and aplastic crises for aslong as 7 days after onset of illness, and personswith chronic infection for years. Pregnant personnel are at no greater risk of acquiring B19 infection than are nonpregnant per-sonnel; however, if a pregnant woman does acquireB19 infection during the first half of pregnancy, therisk of fetal death (fetal hydrops, spontaneous abor-tion, and stillbirth) is increased. 274,275Because of the serious nature of the consequences for the fetus,female personnel of childbearing age need to becounseled regarding the risk of transmission of B19and appropriate infection control precautions. 3 Isolation precautions are not indicated for most patients with erythema infectiosum because theyare past their period of infectiousness at the timeof clinical illness. 271,274However, patients in aplas- tic crisis from B19 or patients with chronic B19infection may transmit the virus to susceptiblehealth care personnel or other patients; therefore,patients with preexisting anemia who are admit-ted to the hospital with febrile illness and tran-sient aplastic crises should remain on droplet pre-cautions for 7 days and patients with known orsuspected chronic infection with B19 should beplaced on droplet precautions on admission andfor the duration of hospitalization. 3,263Work restrictions are not necessary for personnelexposed to B19.12. Pertussis Nosocomial transmission of Bordetella pertus- sishas involved both patients and personnel; nonimmunized children are at greatest risk.276-280 Serologic studies of health care personnel indi-cate that personnel may be exposed to andinfected with pertussis much more frequentlythan indicated by the occurrence of recognizedclinical illness. 277,279,281,282In one such study, the level of pertussis agglutination antibodies wasfound to correlate with the degree of patient con-tact; the prevalence of such antibody was highestin pediatric house staff (82%) and ward nurses(71%) and lowest in nurses with administrativeresponsibilities (35%). 277 Pertussis is highly contagious; secondary attack rates exceed 80% in susceptible household con-tacts. 283-285B. pertussis transmission occurs by con- tact with respiratory secretions or large aerosoldroplets from the respiratory tracts of infected per-sons. The incubation period is usually 7 to 10 days.The period of communicability starts at the onset ofthe catarrhal stage and extends into the paroxysmalstage up to 3 weeks after onset of symptoms.Prevention of secondary transmission of pertussis isespecially difficult during the early stages of the dis-ease because pertussis is highly communicable inthe catarrhal stage, when the symptoms are non-specific and the diagnosis is uncertain. During nosocomial pertussis outbreaks, the risk of acquiring infection among patients or personnelis often difficult to quantify because exposure is noteasily determined. Furthermore, clinical symptomsin adults are less severe than in children and maynot be recognized as pertussis. Pertussis should beconsidered for any person seeking treatment withan acute cough lasting at least 7 days, particularlyif accompanied by paroxysms of coughing, inspira-tory whoop, or posttussive vomiting. 280,281 Prevention of transmission of B. pertussis in health care settings involves (a) early diagnosisand treatment of patients with clinical infection,(b) implementation of droplet precautions forinfectious patients, 3(c) exclusion of infectious personnel from work, and (d) administration ofpostexposure prophylaxis to persons exposed toinfectious patients. 279Patients with suspected or confirmed pertussis who are admitted to the hos-pital need to be placed on droplet precautionsuntil they have clinical improvement and havereceived antimicrobial therapy for at least 5 days. Vaccination of adolescents and adults with whole-cell B. pertussis vaccine is not recommend- ed 19because local and systemic reactions haveAJIC 312 CDC Personnel Health Guideline June 1998AJIC Volume 26, Number 3 CDC Personnel Health Guideline 313 been observed more frequently in these groups than in children. Acellular pertussis vaccine isimmunogenic in adults and carries a lower risk ofadverse events than does whole-cell vaccine. 280,286 However, the acellular vaccine has not beenlicensed for use in persons 7 years old or older.Because immunity among vaccine recipientswanes 5 to 10 years after the last vaccine dose(usually given at 4 to 6 years of age), personnelmay play an important role in transmitting pertus-sis to susceptible infants. However, additionalstudies are needed to assess whether booster dosesof acellular vaccines are indicated for adults. Postexposure prophylaxis is indicated for person- nel exposed to pertussis; a 14-day course of eithererythromycin (500 mg orally four times daily) ortrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (one tablet twicedaily) has been used for this purpose. The efficacyof such prophylaxis has not been well documented,but studies suggest that it may minimize transmis-sion. 19,279,287,288There are no data on the efficacy of newer macrolides (clarithromycin or azithromycin)for prophylaxis in persons exposed to pertussis. Restriction from duty is indicated for personnel with pertussis from the beginning of the catarrhalstage through the third week after onset of parox-ysms, or until 5 days after the start of effectiveantimicrobial therapy. Exposed personnel do notneed to be excluded from duty. 13. Poliomyelitis The last cases of indigenously acquired wild- virus poliomyelitis occurred in the United Statesin 1979. 289Since then, all cases of endemic poliomyelitis reported in the United States (5 to10 endemic cases/year) have been related to theadministration of oral polio vaccine (OPV). 21 Although the risk of transmission of poliovirus inthe United States is very low, wild poliovirus maypotentially be introduced into susceptible popula-tions with low immunization levels. Poliovirus is transmitted through contact with feces or urine of infected persons but can bespread by contact with respiratory secretionsand, in rare instances, through items contami-nated with feces. The incubation period for non-paralytic poliomyelitis is 3 to 6 days, but is usu-ally 7 to 21 days for paralytic polio. 290Com- municability is greatest immediately before andafter the onset of symptoms, when the virus is inthe throat and excreted in high concentration infeces. The virus can be recovered from the throatfor 1 week and from feces for several weeks tomonths after onset of symptoms.Vaccine-associated poliomyelitis may occur in the recipient (7 to 21 days after vaccine administration)or susceptible contacts of the vaccine recipient (20 to29 days after vaccine administration). 289Adults have a slightly increased risk of vaccine-associated para-lytic poliomyelitis after receipt of OPV; therefore,inactivated poliovirus be usedwhen adult immunization is warranted. 8,16,21Also, because immunocompromised persons may be atgreater risk for development of poliomyelitis afterexposure to vaccine virus, IPV rather than OPV is rec-ommended when vaccinating pregnant or immuno-compromised personnel, or personnel who may havecontact with immunocompromised patients. 8,16,21,290 Health care personnel who may have contact with patients excreting wild virus (e.g., importedpoliomyelitis case) and laboratory personnel han-dling specimens containing poliovirus or per-forming cultures to amplify virus should receive acomplete series of polio vaccine; if previously vac-cinated, they may require a booster dose of eitherIPV or OPV. 8,21For situations where immediate protection is necessary (e.g., an imported case ofwild-virus poliomyelitis requiring care), addition-al doses of OPV should be given to adults whohave previously completed a polio vaccine series. 21 14. Rabies Human rabies cases occur primarily from exposure to rabid animals. Cases of human rabieshave increased in the United States during the1990s. 291Laboratory and animal care personnel who are exposed to infected animals, their tis-sues, and their excretions are at risk for the dis-ease. Also, rabies transmission to laboratory per-sonnel has been reported in vaccine productionand research facilities after exposure to high-titered infectious aerosols. 292,293Theoretically, rabies may be transmitted to health care person-nel from exposures (bite and nonbite) to salivafrom infected patients, but no cases have beendocumented after these types of exposures. 294 It is also possible for rabies to be transmitted when other potentially infectious material (suchas brain tissue) comes into contact with nonintactskin or mucous membranes. 22,294Bites that pene- trate the skin, especially bites to the face andhands, pose the greatest risk of transmission ofrabies virus from animals to human beings. 22The incubation period for rabies is usually 1 to 3months, but longer periods have been reported. 295 Exposures to rabies can be minimized by adher- ing to standard precautions when caring for per-sons with suspected or confirmed rabies 3and byusing proper biosafety precautions in laborato- ries.5Preexposure vaccination has been recom- mended for all personnel who (a) work withrabies virus or infected animals or (b) engage indiagnostic, production, or research activities withrabies virus. 5,22Consideration also may be given to providing preexposure vaccination to animal han-dlers when research animals are obtained fromthe wild, rather than from a known supplier thatbreeds the animals. Postexposure prophylaxis has been adminis- tered to health care personnel after exposures topatients with rabies (Table 1), 295-297but decisions regarding postexposure prophylaxis should bemade on a case-by-case basis after discussion withpublic health authorities. 22 15. Rubella Nosocomial transmission of rubella has occurred from both male and female personnel toother susceptible personnel and patients, as wellas from patients to susceptible personnel andother patients. 298-305 Rubella is transmitted by contact with nasopha- ryngeal droplets from infected persons. The incu-bation period is variable but may range from 12 to23 days; most persons have the rash 14 to 16 daysafter exposure. The disease is most contagiouswhen the rash is erupting, but virus may be shedfrom 1 week before to 5 to 7 days after the onsetof the rash. 306Rubella in adults is usually a mild disease, lasting only a few days; 30% to 50% ofcases may be subclinical or inapparent. Droplet precautions are used to prevent trans- mission of rubella. Infants with congenital rubellamay excrete virus for months to years; when caringfor such patients, it is therefore advisable to usecontact precautions for the first year of life, unlessnasopharyngeal and urine culture results are nega-tive for rubella virus after 3 months of age. 3 Ensuring immunity among all health care per- sonnel (male and female) is the most effectiveway to eliminate nosocomial transmission ofrubella. 8,9,14,256,307Persons should be considered susceptible to rubella if they lack (a) documenta-tion of one dose of live rubella vaccine on orafter their first birthday and (b) laboratory evi-dence of immunity (persons with indeterminatelevels are considered susceptible). A history ofprevious rubella infection is unreliable andshould not be considered indicative of immunityto rubella. Although birth before 1957 is general-ly considered acceptable evidence of rubellaimmunity, a dose of MMR has been recommend-ed for those health care personnel that do not have laboratory evidence of immunity. 9In addi- tion, birth before 1957 is not considered accept-able evidence of rubella immunity for women ofchildbearing age; history of vaccination or labo-ratory evidence of rubella immunity is particu-larly important for women who may becomepregnant. 9Voluntary immunization programs are usually inadequate to ensure personnel pro-tection. 7,308Because many health departments mandate rubella immunity for health care per-sonnel, personnel health programs should con-sult with their local or state health departmentsbefore establishing policies for their facilities. Serologic screening of personnel for immunity to rubella need not be done before vaccinatingagainst rubella, unless the medical facility consid-ers it cost-effective or the person getting vaccinat-ed requests it. 7,235-237When serologic screening before vaccination is done, tracking systems areneeded to ensure that those identified as suscepti-ble are subsequently vaccinated in a timely man-ner. 237Likewise, during rubella outbreaks, sero- logic screening is not necessary. Pregnant womenwho are already immune to rubella are not atincreased risk for adverse advents. 309However, for theoretic reasons, a risk to the fetus from admin-istration of live-virus vaccines cannot be excluded.Women should be counseled to avoid pregnancyfor 30 days after administration of MMR or otherrubella-containing vaccines. Routine precautionsfor vaccinating postpubertal women include (a)asking whether they are or may be pregnant, (b)not vaccinating those who say they are or may bepregnant, and (c) vaccinating those who state theyare not pregnant after the potential risk to thefetus has been explained. If a pregnant woman isvaccinated or a woman becomes pregnant within3 months after vaccination, she should be coun-seled about the theoretic basis of concern for thefetus, but MMR vaccination during pregnancyshould not ordinarily be a reason to consider ter-mination of pregnancy. Rubella-susceptiblewomen who are not vaccinated because of preg-nancy should be counseled about the importanceof being vaccinated as soon as they are no longerpregnant. 9MMR is the vaccine of choice for rubel- la, especially when the recipient also is likely to besusceptible to measles, mumps, or both (Table 2). Work restrictions are necessary for personnel who acquire rubella; ill personnel need to beexcluded from duty for 5 days after the rashappears. Likewise, personnel susceptible to rubel-la require exclusion from duty from the seventhAJIC 314 CDC Personnel Health Guideline June 1998AJIC Volume 26, Number 3 CDC Personnel Health Guideline 315 day after the first exposure through the 21st day after the last exposure (Table 3). 16. Scabies and pediculosis a.Scabies Scabies is caused by infestation with the mite Sarcoptes scabiei . The conventional (typical) clini- cal presentation of scabies includes intense pruri-tus and cutaneous tracks, where mites have bur-rowed into the skin. Crusted or \"Norwegian\" sca-bies may develop among immunocompromisedand elderly individuals in which their skin maybecome hyperkeratotic; pruritus may not be pre-sent, which also makes diagnosis difficult. In con-ventional scabies, 10 to 15 mites are present,whereas in crusted scabies, thousands of mitesare harbored in the skin, increasing the potentialfor transmission. 310,311 Nosocomial outbreaks of scabies have occurred in a variety of health care settings,including intensive care units, 312rehabilitation centers,313long-term care facilities,314,315hospital wards,316a dialysis unit,317and a health care laundry.318In recent years there has been an increase in the occurrence of crusted scabiesamong immunocompromised patients, particu-larly persons with HIV, which has led to thetransmission of scabies among personnel,patients, and their families. 310,312-316,319-321 Nosocomial transmission of scabies occurs primarily through prolonged skin-to-skin con-tact with an infested person who has conven-tional scabies. 310,322Shorter periods of skin-to- skin contact with persons who have crusted sca-bies may result in transmission of scabies. 323 Personnel have acquired scabies while perform-ing patient care duties such as sponge bathing,lifting, or applying body lotions. 310,311,319,324 Transmission by casual contact, such as by hold-ing hands, or through inanimate objects, such asinfested bedding, clothes, or other fomites, hasbeen reported infrequently. 317,318 The use of contact precautions when taking care of infested patients before application ofscabicides can decrease the risk of transmission topersonnel. 3,311Routine cleaning of the environ- ment of patients with typical scabies, especiallybed linens and upholstered furniture, will aid ineliminating the mites. Additional environmentalcleaning procedures may be warranted for crust-ed scabies. 310,311,325-327 Recommendations for treatment and control of scabies in health care institutions have beenpublished previously. lindanehave been reported. 329Single-dose oral iver- mectin has recently been shown to be an effec-tive therapy for scabies 323,330,332but has not received Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approval for this purpose. Most infested health care workers have typical scabies with low mite loads 333; a single correct application of a scabicide is adequate and imme-diately decreases the risk of transmis-sion. 25,315-317,319,322,324,334There are no controlled evaluations of the efficacy of prophylactic scabi-cide therapy among health care personnel, andsome experts recommend two applications ofscabicide for all infested personnel. 311,315,321If personnel continue to have symptoms after ini-tial treatment, another application of scabicidemay be needed. Persistent symptoms likely rep-resent newly hatched mites rather than newinfestation; however, pruritus after scabies infes-tation and treatment may persist for as long as 2weeks, even without infestation. 25Patients with crusted scabies may require repeated treatmentsand should be observed for recurrence of themite infestation. 310,311,314,326Personnel who are exposed to scabies but lack signs of infestationdo not usually require prophylactic treatmentwith scabicides. In outbreak situations wheretransmission continues to occur, prophylaxismay be warranted for both patients and exposedhealth care personnel. 311, 313 Restrictions from patient care are indicated for personnel infested with scabies until after theyreceive initial treatment and have been medicallyevaluated and determined to be free of infestation.They should be advised to report for further eval-uation if symptoms do not subside. b.Pediculosis Pediculosis is caused by infestation with any of three species of lice: Pediculus humanus capitus (human head louse), and Phthirus pubis (pubic or crab louse). Head lice are transmitted by head-to-head con- tact or by contact with infested fomites such ashats, combs, or brushes. Nosocomial transmis-sion, although not common, has occurred. 310 Body lice are usually associated with poor hygiene and overcrowded conditions. Trans-mission occurs by contact with the skin or cloth-ing of an infested person. Nosocomial transmis-sion is unlikely.Pubic lice are primarily found in the pubic hair but can be found in the axilla, eyelashes, oreyebrows. Transmission occurs primarilythrough intimate physical or sexual contact.Transmission by fomites, such as toilet seats orbedding, is uncommon. Nosocomial transmis-sion is very unlikely. Recommendations for control of pediculosis have been published previously. 310,327,335The drugs recommended for treatment to various drugs has been reported.Local health departments may have informationabout drugs that are effective in their areas.Health care personnel exposed to patients withpediculosis do not require treatment, unless theyshow evidence of infestation. Restriction from patient care is indicated for personnel with pediculosis until after they receiveinitial treatment and are found to be free of adultand immature lice. If symptoms do not subsideafter initial treatment, they should be advised toreport for further evaluation. 17. Staphylococcus aureus infection and carriage Staphylococcal infection and carriage occur fre- quently in human beings. In hospitals, the mostimportant sources of S. aureus are infected and colonized patients. Previously, methicillin-suscep-tible (but penicillin-resistant) S. aureus accounted for most staphylococcal infections. In recentyears, however, methicillin-resistant S. aureus has accounted for approximately 80% of all S. aureus isolates reported to the National NosocomialInfections Surveillance System. 336,337The epidemi- ology of methicillin-resistant S. aureus does not appear to differ from that of methicillin-suscepti-ble, penicillin-resistant S. aureus , except that out- breaks of methicillin-resistant S. aureus tend to occur more frequently among elderly or immuno-compromised patients or among patients withsevere underlying conditions. 338,339 Nosocomial transmission of S. aureus occurs primarily by the hands of personnel, which canbecome contaminated by contact with the colo-nized or infected body sites of patients. 339,340 Hospital personnel who are infected or colonizedwith S. aureus also can serve as reservoirs and dis- seminators of S. aureus, 341-344and infected dietary personnel have been implicated in staphylococcalfood poisoning. 345The role of contaminated envi- ronmental surfaces in transmission of S. aureushas rarely been well documented346and remains controversial, although heavy contamination offomites may facilitate transmission to patients byhands of personnel. 339 The incubation period for S. aureus infections varies by type of disease. For food-borne illnessit is 30 minutes to 6 hours, for bullous impetigoit is 1 to 10 days, for toxic shock syndrome it isusually 2 days, and for other types of infection itis variable. 347 Carriage of S. aureus is most common in the anterior nares, but other sites, such as the hands,axilla, perineum, nasopharynx, and oropharynx,may also be involved. 339The frequency of nasal carriage of S. aureus among health care personnel ranges between 20% and 90%, but fewer than 10%of healthy nasal carriers disperse the organismsinto the air. 342Nasal carriers with upper respirato- ry symptoms can disseminate the organism moreeffectively. 342Carriage of S. aureus in the nares has been shown to correspond to hand carriage,336 and persons with skin lesions caused by S. aureus are more likely than asymptomatic nasal carriersto disseminate the organism. Culture surveys of personnel can detect carriers of S. aureus but do not indicate which carriers are likely to disseminate organisms. Thus, such sur-veys are not cost-effective and may subject per-sonnel with positive culture results to unneces-sary treatment and removal from duty. A morereasonable approach is to conduct active surveil-lance for nosocomial S. aureus infections. Culture surveys may be indicated if, after a thorough epi-demiologic investigation, personnel are linked toinfections. Such implicated personnel can then beremoved from clinical duties until carriage hasbeen eradicated. 339,341,348-350 Several antimicrobial regimens have been used successfully to eradicate staphylococcal carriage inhealth care personnel. These regimens includeorally administered antimicrobial agents (e.g.,rifampin, clindamycin, or ciprofloxacin) alone orin combination with another oral (e.g., trimetho-prim-sulfamethoxazole) or topical (mupirocin)antimicrobial. 349,351-363Resistant S. aureus strains have emerged after the use of these oral or topicalantimicrobial agents for eradication of S. aureus colonization. 18,210,349,353,364-366Thus, antimicrobial treatment to eradicate carriage may be best if lim-ited to personnel who are carriers epidemiological-ly linked to disease transmission. Nosocomialtransmission of S. aureus can be prevented by adherence to standard precautions and other formsof transmission-based precautions as needed. 3AJIC 316 CDC Personnel Health Guideline June 1998AJIC Volume 26, Number 3 CDC Personnel Health Guideline 317 Restriction from patient-care activities or food handling is indicated for personnel who havedraining skin lesions that are infected with S. aureus until they have received appropriate thera- py and the infection has resolved. No work restric-tions are necessary for personnel who are colo-nized with S. aureus , unless they have been epi- demiologically implicated in S. aureus transmis- sion within the facility. 18. Streptococcus , group A infection Group A Streptococcus (GAS) has been trans- mitted from infected patients to health care per-sonnel after contact with infected secretions, 367-369 and the infected personnel have subsequentlyacquired a variety GAS-related illnesses (e.g.,toxic shock-like syndrome, cellulitis, lymphangi-tis, and pharyngitis). personnel whowere GAS carriers have infrequently been linkedto sporadic outbreaks of surgical site, postpartum,or burn wound infections 370-376and to food-borne transmission of GAS causing pharyngitis.377In these outbreaks, carriage was documented inthe pharynx, 369,372,378the skin,369,370the rec- tum,369,375and the female genital tract the infected personnel.369,374,379 The incubation period for GAS pharyngitis is 2 to 5 days, but for impetigo is 7 to 10 days. The incu-bation period is variable for other GAS infections. 380 Culture surveys to detect GAS carriage among personnel are not warranted, unless personnel areepidemiologically linked to cases of nosocomialinfection. 378In instances where thorough epi- demiologic investigation has implicated person-nel in nosocomial transmission, cultures may beobtained from skin lesions, pharynx, rectum, andvagina; GAS isolates obtained from personnel andpatients can be serotyped to determine strainrelatedness. 373Treatment of personnel carriers needs to be individually determined because (a)experience is limited regarding the treatment ofpersonnel carriers implicated in GAS outbreaksand (b) carriage of the organism by personnelmay be recurrent through long periods. 369-371,374 Contact is the major mode of transmission of GASin these health care settings. Airborne transmis-sion during outbreaks has been suggested by sev-eral investigators, and some have demonstratedthat exercising and changing of clothing can leadto airborne dissemination of GAS from rectal andvaginal carriage. 369,374,375,379Nosocomial transmis- sion of GAS to personnel can be prevented byadherence to standard precautions or other trans-mission-based precautions as needed. 3Restriction from patient care activities and food handling is indicated for personnel with GAS infec-tions until 24 hours after they have received appro-priate therapy. However, no work restrictions arenecessary for personnel who are colonized withGAS, unless they have been epidemiologically linkedto transmission of infection within the facility. 19. Tuberculosis Nosocomial transmission of tuberculosis (TB) is well documented, but such transmission in theUnited States is generally low. However, the riskmay be increased in health care facilities locatedin communities with (a) high rates of HIV , (b)high numbers of persons from TB-endemic coun-tries, and (c) communities with a high prevalenceof TB infection. 381,382In some areas in the United States, the incidence and prevalence of mul-tidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) have also increased, and nosocomialMDR-TB outbreaks have occurred. 383-391The increased risk of occupational acquisition of TBby health care personnel has been reported fordecades, and it dramatically decreased after theintroduction of effective antituberculousdrugs. 392,393Skin-test conversion rates among health care personnel after routine skin testinghave ranged from 0.11% to 10%. 394Among health care personnel with known exposure to an infec-tious patient with TB or involved in prolongednosocomial outbreaks of TB, the skin-test rates have ranged from 18% to 55%. 383- 385,388,389,393,395-401Health care personnel with severely compromised immune systems, especial-ly those infected with HIV 381,402and including those with malignancies or receiving immuno-suppressive therapy, are at high risk for develop-ment of active disease after acquisition of tuber-culous infection. It has been estimated that per-sons infected with M. tuberculosis and coinfected with HIV have an 8% to 10% risk per year fordevelopment of active TB, whereas immunocom-petent persons infected with TB have a 10% life-time risk for active disease. 403 The transmission of TB in health care facilities has been primarily caused by incomplete imple-mentation of recommended TB infection controlmeasures. 396In 1994, the CDC published detailed recommendations for the prevention of trans-mission of TB in health care settings,\"Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission ofM. tuberculosis in Health Care Facilities, 1994.\" 382A summary of the recommendations pertaining to personnel health follows.a.Strategies for prevention of transmission of TB The risk of transmission of TB to or from per- sonnel in a health care facility varies accordingto the type and size of the facility, the preva-lence of TB in the community, the patient pop-ulation served by the facility, the occupationalgroup the person represents, the area of thefacility where the person works, and the effec-tiveness of the facility's TB control program. Adetailed risk assessment is essential in identify-ing the nature of TB control measures that areappropriate for a particular facility, as well asfor specific areas and occupational groupswithin a facility. 382,404A risk assessment should include the following: (a) review of the commu-nity TB profile, (b) review of the number ofpatients with TB who were treated in each areaof the facility, (c) review of the drug-suscepti-bility patterns of TB isolates from patientstreated in the facility, (d) an analysis of purifiedprotein derivative (PPD) skin-test results ofhealth care personnel by work area or occupa-tional group, (e) an evaluation of infection con-trol parameters, including isolation policies,laboratory diagnostic capabilities, and antitu-berculous therapy regimens, (f) an observation-al review of TB infection control practices, and(g) evaluation of the function and maintenanceof environmental controls. 382 Transmission of TB can be minimized by developing and implementing an effective TBcontrol program that is based on a hierarchy ofcontrols: (a) administrative controls, (b) engi-neering controls, and (c) personal respiratoryprotection. 382,384,386,393,396,404,405 b.TB screening program A TB screening program for personnel is an inte- gral part of a health care facility's comprehensiveTB control program. The screening programshould be based on the facility-specific risk assess-ment. It may be advisable to screen immunocom-promised personnel every 6 months. 382 Baseline PPD testing of all personnel (including personnel with a history of bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin [BCG] vaccination) during their preem-ployment physical examination or their applica-tion for hospital privileges will identify personnelwho have been previously infected. For the base-line testing, a two-step procedure for personnelwithout a PPD test in the past 12 months can beused to minimize the likelihood of confusing reac-tivity from an old infection (boosting) with reac-tivity from a recent infection (conversion).Decisions concerning the use of the two-step pro-cedure for baseline testing in a particular facility should be based on the frequency of boosting inthat facility. Criteria used for interpretation of aPPD-test reaction may vary depending on (a) thepurpose (diagnostic or epidemiologic) of the test,(b) the prevalence of TB infection in the popula-tion being tested, (c) the immune status of thehost, and (d) any previous receipt of BCG immu-nization. Detailed recommendations for perform-ing and interpreting skin tests have been pub-lished. 382,406-408 c.Follow-up evaluation The risk assessment will show which health care personnel have the potential for exposure toM. tuberculosis and determine how frequently they should receive PPD testing. At a minimum,annual PPD testing is indicated for personnel withthe potential for exposure to TB. It is also important to obtain an initial chest radiograph for personnel with positive PPD-testreactions, documented PPD-test conversions, orpulmonary symptoms suggestive of TB. Thereare no data to support the use of routine chestradiographic examinations for asymptomaticPPD-negative personnel. In addition, personnelwho have positive PPD-test reactions but alsoreceived adequate preventive treatment do notneed repeat chest films, unless they have pul-monary symptoms suggestive of TB. Repeatchest radiographic examinations of such personshave not been shown to be beneficial or cost-effective in monitoring persons for developmentof disease. However, more frequent monitoringfor symptoms of TB may be considered for per-sonnel who had recent conversion of their PPDtest and those persons who, if infected, are atincreased risk for development of active TB (e.g.,HIV-infected or otherwise severely immunocom-promised persons). 382Routine anergy testing of HIV-seropositive individuals is limited in its use-fulness; however, anergy testing may be useful inguiding individual decisions regarding preven-tive therapy in selected situations. 408 d.Management of personnel after exposure to TB It is important to administer PPD tests to per- sonnel as soon as possible after TB exposures arerecognized. Such immediate PPD testing estab-lishes a baseline with which subsequent PPDtests can be compared. A PPD test performed 12weeks after the last exposure will indicatewhether infection has occurred. Persons alreadyknown to have reactive PPD tests need not beretested. Personnel with evidence of new infec-tion (i.e., PPD-test conversions) need to be evalu-AJIC 318 CDC Personnel Health Guideline June 1998AJIC Volume 26, Number 3 CDC Personnel Health Guideline 319 ated for active TB. If active TB is not diagnosed, preventive therapy should be considered.382 e.Preventive therapy For workers with positive PPD-test results who were probably exposed to drug-susceptible TB,preventive therapy with isoniazid is indicated,unless there are contraindications to such thera-py. 382,407Alternative preventive regimens have been proposed for persons who have positive PPD-testresults after exposure to drug-resistant TB. 409 f.Work restrictions Personnel with active pulmonary or laryngeal TB may be highly infectious; exclusion from duty isindicated until they are noninfectious. If personnelare excluded from duty because of active TB, thefacility should have documentation from theirhealth care providers that personnel are noninfec-tious before they are allowed to return to duty. Thedocumentation needs to include evidence that (a)adequate therapy is being received, (b) the coughhas resolved, and (c) results of three consecutivesputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears collected ondifferent days are negative. personnel resumeduty and while they remain on anti-TB therapy,periodic documentation from their health careproviders is needed to show that effective drugtherapy is being maintained for the recommendedperiod and that their sputum AFB smear resultscontinue to be negative. If personnel discontinuetheir treatment, they need to be evaluated for activeTB; directly observed therapy may be considered. Work restrictions are not necessary for person- nel receiving preventive treatment for latent TB(positive PPD-test result without active disease) orfor personnel with latent TB who do not acceptpreventive therapy. However, these personnelshould be instructed to seek evaluation promptlyif symptoms suggestive of TB develop. g.Considerations for BCG vaccine BCG has not been routinely used in the United States to protect health care personnel. Never-theless, because of the resurgence of TB in theUnited States and new information about the pro-tective effect of BCG, 410,411the role of BCG vaccina- tion in the prevention and control of TB in the coun-try has been reevaluated. 412The following is a sum- mary of the joint statement by the Advisory Councilfor the Elimination of Tuberculosis and ACIPregarding the use of BCG in health care personnel. Two recent metaanalyses of 18 410and 26411BCG studies, respectively, indicate that the efficacy ofBCG vaccine in preventing serious TB is high(>80%) in children and suggest 50% efficacy inadults. However, the protective efficacy of the vac-cine in adolescents and adults, including health care personnel and HIV-infected children andadults, has not been determined. 412 BCG vaccination should not be used as a pri- mary TB control strategy because (a) the protec-tive efficacy of the vaccine in health care person-nel is uncertain and (b) even if vaccination iseffective in an individual, other persons in thehealth care facility are not protected against pos-sible exposure to and infection with drug-resistantstrains of M. tuberculosis . However, BCG vaccina- tion may be indicated for health care personnel ina few geographic areas where the prevalence ofMDR-TB is high, transmission of TB is likely, andTB infection control measures have been imple-mented but have not been successful in control-ling nosocomial transmission. 412Consultation with local and state health departments is advis-able when determining whether to provide BCGvaccination to health care personnel. BCG vaccination often results in local adverse effects (such as muscular soreness, erythema,purulent drainage, and axillary or cervical lym-phadenopathy) for as long as 3 months after vacci-nation; serious long-term complications (such asmusculoskeletal lesions, multiple lymphadenitis,and disseminated BCG disease) are infrequent. 413-415 The safety of BCG vaccination in immunocompro-mised populations (i.e., immunocompromisedfrom immune deficiency diseases, HIV infection,leukemia, lymphoma, or generalized malignancy,or immunosuppressed as a result of therapy withcorticosteroids, alkylating drugs, antimetabolites,or radiation) has not been determined by adequateepidemiologic studies. However, because of thepossibility of disseminated BCG infection in suchpersons, 416-419BCG vaccination is not recommend- ed for immunocompromised personnel.412The safety of BCG vaccination in pregnant women hasalso not been evaluated; therefore, it is not recom-mended for pregnant personnel. 412 PPD testing is not contraindicated for persons who have received BCG vaccine and can be usedto support or exclude the diagnosis of infectionwith M. tuberculosis. 412PPD-test reactivity caused by BCG vaccination wanes with time420-422and is unlikely to persist longer than 10 years after vac-cination in the absence of infection with M. tuber- culosis. 420,421After a person has been vaccinated with BCG, the presence or size of a PPD-test reac-tion cannot be used to predict whether BCG willprovide any protection against TB disease 423,424or to determine whether the reaction is caused byM. tuberculosis infection or the previous BCGvaccination.425However, a BCG-vaccinated per- son who has a PPD-test reaction of 10 mm induration should be considered infected withTB, especially if the vaccinee (a) is a contact of aperson with infectious TB, particularly if theinfectious person has transmitted M. tuberculosis to others, (b) is from a country with high preva-lence of TB, or (c) is continually exposed to pop-ulations in which the prevalence of TB is high. 412 20. Vaccinia (smallpox) Through aggressive surveillance for smallpox combined with the effective use of smallpox vac-cine (vaccinia virus vaccine), the World HealthOrganization was able to declare the world free ofsmallpox in 1980. The smallpox vaccine licensedfor use in the United States is derived from infec-tious vaccinia virus. After vaccination, the viruscan be cultured from the vaccination site until thescab has separated from the skin (2 to 21 daysafter vaccination); thus, susceptible persons mayacquire vaccinia from a recently vaccinated per-son. 426-429Covering the vaccination site and wash- ing hands after contact with the vaccination site(including bandages) will prevent transmission.Recently, recombinant vaccinia viruses have beenengineered to express immunizing agents of sev-eral viruses (e.g., herpesvirus, HBV, influenza).There is a theoretic risk that transmission couldoccur from contact with contaminated dressingsor by contact with recombinant vaccine, but nosuch transmission has been reported among per-sonnel who provide care to recipients of therecombinant vaccine. Infections also have beenreported among laboratory personnel who handleviral cultures or materials contaminated with vac-cinia or recombinant viruses. 18,162 Smallpox vaccination (every 10 years) is indicat- ed for personnel who work directly with orthopoxviruses (e.g., monkeypox, vaccinia, variola) or inanimal care areas where orthopox viruses are stud-ied. In selected instances, vaccination may be con-sidered for personnel who provide care to recipientsof recombinant vaccinia vaccine. 9,18Personnel who receive the vaccine may continue to have contactwith patients if the vaccination site is covered andhandwashing is strictly observed. 18Vaccine is not recommended for personnel with immunosuppres-sion or eczema or for personnel who are pregnant. 21. Varicella Nosocomial transmission of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is well recognized.430-441Sources for nosoco- mial exposures have included patients, health carepersonnel, and visitors (including the children of personnel) with either varicella or herpes zoster. All susceptible adults in health care settings are at risk for varicella and its complications. During1990 through 1994, fewer than 5% of varicellacases occurred among adults older than 20 years,but they accounted for 55% of varicella-relateddeaths. Certain persons are at higher risk forsevere disease and secondary complications: preg-nant women, premature infants born to varicella-susceptible mothers, infants born at less than 28weeks' gestation or weighing \u00a31000 gm (regard- less of maternal immune status), and immuno-compromised patients. 13 The incubation period for varicella is usually 14 to 16 days but may be from 10 to 21 days afterexposure, although the incubation period may beshorter in immunocompromised persons who receive postexposure VZV immuneglobulin, the incubation period may be as long as28 days after exposure. Transmission of infectionmay occur from 2 days before onset of rash andusually as long as 5 days after rash onset. 442 VZV is transmitted by the contact with infect- ed lesions and, in hospitals, airborne transmis-sion has occurred from patients with varicella orzoster to susceptible persons who had no directcontact with the infected patient. 443-447Adher- ence to airborne and contact precautions whencaring for patients with known or suspectedVZV infection can reduce the risk of transmis-sion to personnel. 3 It is generally advisable to allow only personnel who are immune to varicella to take care ofpatients with VZV. Because of the possibility oftransmission to and development of severe illnessin high-risk patients, personnel with localizedzoster should not take care of such patients untilall lesions are dry and crusted. 13,447Personnel with localized zoster are not likely to transmit infectionto immunocompetent patients if their lesions canbe covered. However, some institutions mayexclude personnel with zoster from work untiltheir lesions dry and crust. 439 a.Varicella screening and vaccination Serologic tests have been used to assess the accuracy of reported histories of chicken-pox. 440,448-450In adults, a history of varicella is highly predictive of serologic immunity (97%to 99% seropositive). Most adults seropositive In health careinstitutions, of personnelwho have negative or uncertain histories isAJIC 320 CDC Personnel Health Guideline June 1998AJIC Volume 26, Number 3 CDC Personnel Health Guideline 321 likely to be cost-effective, depending on the rel- ative costs of the test and vaccine.9,13 A variety of methods have been used for detect- ing varicella antibody, but a commercially avail-able latex agglutination test provides prompt, sen-sitive, and specific serologic results at a reason-able cost. The latex agglutination test may notdetect low levels of protective antibody that canoccur after vaccination; however, a test withincreased sensitivity and specificity is currentlyunder development. Routine testing for varicellaimmunity after vaccination is not necessary,because 99% of persons are seropositive after thesecond dose. Moreover, seroconversion does notalways result in full protection against disease.However, testing vaccinees after exposures may bewarranted. In addition, vaccinated persons whoare exposed to varicella but lack antibody may beretested in 5 to 6 days to determine whether theyare antibody seropositive after the second test andtherefore unlikely to acquire varicella. 13 In March 1995, a live-attenuated varicella vac- cine was licensed for use in the United States.Administration of varicella vaccine is recom-mended for all susceptible health care person-nel, especially those who will have close contactwith persons at high risk for serious complica-tions. 9,13,451,452Effective varicella vaccination pro- grams require two doses of vaccine to achievehigh seroconversion rates in adults; 451the need for and response to booster doses of vaccine areunknown. Vaccination provides approximately70% protection against infection and 95% pro-tection against severe disease in follow-up from7 to 10 years after vaccination. 13Cases of vari- cella have occurred among vaccinees after expo-sure to wild-type virus (\"breakthrough infec-tion\"). Data from vaccine trials in which vacci-nees of all ages were followed up for as long as9 years indicate that 1% to 4% of vaccine recip-ients per year acquire varicella, depending onthe vaccine lot and interval after vaccination. 9,13 However, vaccinated persons have milder dis-ease (e.g., afebrile, a mean of 50 skin lesionsthat are often not vesicular, and shorter durationof illness) than do unvaccinated individuals(e.g., febrile with several hundred vesicularlesions) 453,454and are less likely to transmit dis- ease than unvaccinated persons. The rate of transmission of disease from vac- cinees who contract varicella is low for vacci-nated children but has not been studied inadults. Active surveillance for 1 to 8 years aftervaccination of 2141 children between 1981 and1989 in 10 different trials 9resulted in reports of breakthrough infections in 78 children, whichfurther resulted in secondary cases in 12.2%(11/90) of vaccinated siblings. Illness was mildin both index and secondary cases. There alsohas been a report of transmission from a vacci-nated child in whom breakthrough diseaseoccurred to a susceptible mother. 9 All information currently available on vaccine efficacy and the persistence of antibody in vac-cinees is based on research conducted in set-tings where infection is highly prevalent and notaffected by the wide use of vaccine. Thus, theextent to which the protection provided by vac-cination has been increased by boosting fromexposure to natural virus and whether longerterm immunity may wane as the prevalence ofnatural VZV decreases are unknown. b.Transmission of vaccine virus In clinical trials, 3.8% of children and 5.5% of adolescents and adults acquired a nonlocalizedrash (median five lesions) after the first injection,and 0.9% of adolescents and adults acquired anonlocalized rash after the second injection.Available data suggest that healthy children havelimited potential to transmit vaccine virus to sus-ceptible contacts (estimated to be <1%) but thatthe risk of transmission from immunocompro-mised vaccinees is higher. 13,455,456Tertiary trans- mission of vaccine virus to a second healthy sib-ling of a vaccinated leukemic child has alsooccurred. 456These data suggest that healthy, vac- cinated individuals have a very small risk of trans-mitting vaccine virus to their contacts; this riskmay be higher in those who acquire a varicella-like rash after vaccination. Although the risk of transmission of vaccine virus from vaccinees is not known, the risk if anyappears to be very low, and the benefits of vacci-nating susceptible health care personnel clearlyoutweigh this potential risk. As a safeguard, insti-tutions may wish to consider precautions for vac-cinated personnel who acquire a rash or who willhave contact with susceptible persons at high riskfor serious complications. c. Management of health care personnel exposed to varicella When unvaccinated susceptible personnel are exposed to varicella, they are potentially infec-tious 10 to 21 days after exposure, and exclusionfrom duty is indicated from the tenth day after thefirst exposure through the 21st day after the lastexposure, or until all lesions are dry and crusted ifvaricella occurs (Table 3). 256AJIC 322 CDC Personnel Health Guideline June 1998 Table 6.

Exclusion from duty is indi-cated if symptoms (fever, upper respiratory tractsymptoms, or rash) develop. Vaccination should be considered for exposed unvaccinated health care personnel without docu-mented immunity. 441,452Because the efficacy of post- exposure vaccination is unknown, however, personsvaccinated after an exposure should be managed aspreviously recommended for unvaccinated persons. The routine postexposure use of VZV immune globulin (VZIG) is not recommended amongimmunocompetent health care personnel. 13VZIG can be costly, does not necessarily prevent varicel-la, and may prolong the incubation period by aweek or more, thus extending the time that per-sonnel will be restricted from duty. The use ofVZIG may be considered for immunocompro-mised (e.g., HIV infected) or pregnant health carepersonnel. 13,457Postexposure use of acyclovir may be effective and less costly than the use of VZIG insome susceptible persons. 457However, additional data concerning the efficacy of acyclovir for post-exposure prophylaxis are needed before such usecan be recommended. 9,13,441,458 22. Viral respiratory infections Viral respiratory infections are common prob- lems in health care settings. Nosocomial respira-tory infections can be caused by a number ofviruses, adenoviruses, influenza virus,parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus(RSV), and rhinoviruses. Because influenza andRSV substantially contribute to the morbidity andmortality associated with viral pneumonia andboth have been well studied epidemiologically,this section focuses on prevention of these twoviral infections among personnel. Additionalinformation on influenza and RSV can be foundin the \"Guideline for Prevention of NosocomialPneumonia.\" 459 a.Influenza Nosocomial transmission of influenza has been reported in acute and long-term care facil-ities. 460-465Transmission has occurred from patients to health care personnel,462,464from health care personnel to patients,466and among health care personnel.465,467-472 Influenza is believed to be transmitted from person to person by direct deposition of virus-laden large droplets onto the mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract of an individual duringclose contact with an infected person, as well asby droplet nuclei or small-particle aerosols. 21,290,473 Although the extent of transmission by virus-con-taminated hands or fomites is not known, it is notthe primary mode of transmission. 473 The incubation period of influenza is usually 1 to 5 days, and the period of greatest communica-bility is during the first 3 days of illness.However, virus can be shed before the onset ofsymptoms and as long as 7 days after illnessonset. 474-476Persons at greatest risk for influenza- related complications include (a) persons olderthan 65 years, (b) residents of nursing homesand other chronic care facilities, (c) persons withchronic pulmonary or cardiovascular conditions,and (d) persons with diabetes mellitus. 17 Adherence to droplet precautions may preventnosocomial transmission. 3 Administration of influenza vaccine to health care personnel, including pregnant women,9 before the beginning of each influenza season canhelp to (a) reduce the risk to health care personnelof influenza infection, (b) prevent transmission ofinfluenza from personnel to persons at high riskfor complications, and (c) reduce personnelabsenteeism during community outbreaks.Innovative methods may be needed to increaseinfluenza immunization rates among health carepersonnel. 477Immunization rates may also be increased by providing data to health care person-nel on the low rates of systemic reactions toinfluenza vaccine among healthy adults. 478 During institutional outbreaks of influenza, prophylactic antiviral agents (e.g., amantadineand rimantadine) may be used in conjunctionwith influenza vaccine to reduce the severityand duration of illness among unvaccinatedhealth care personnel. Amantadine and rimanta-dine may be administered for 2 weeks after per-sonnel vaccination or, in unvaccinated person-nel, for the duration of influenza activity in thecommunity. 17,459,465,479 b.Respiratory syncytial virus Nosocomial transmission of respiratory (RSV) is greatest during the early winterwhen community RSV outbreaks occur; patients,visitors, and health care personnel may transmitthe virus in the health care setting. RSV infectionis most common among infants and children, whoare likely to acquire more severe disease. BecauseRSV infection can also occur simultaneously withother respiratory viruses, it may go unrecog-nized.480,481Nosocomial transmission has been reported most frequently among newborn andpediatric patients, 482,483but outbreaks associated with substantial morbidity and mortality havebeen reported among adults in bone-marrowtransplant centers, 484intensive care units,485and long-term care facilities.486,487 RSV is present in large numbers in the respira- tory secretions of persons symptomatically infect-ed with the virus and can be transmitted directlythrough large droplets during close contact withsuch persons or indirectly by hands or fomitesthat are contaminated with RSV. Hands canbecome contaminated through handling of infect-ed persons' respiratory secretions or contaminat-ed fomites and by touching theeyes or nose. 459The incubation period ranges from 2 to 8 days; 4 to 6 days is most common. Ingeneral, infected persons shed the virus for 3 to 8days, but young infants may shed virus for as longas 3 to 4 weeks. Adherence to contact precautionseffectively prevents nosocomial transmission. c.Work restrictions Because large numbers of personnel may have viral respiratory illnesses during the winter, itmay not be possible to restrict infected personnelfrom all patient care duties. Nevertheless, it maybe prudent to restrict personnel with acute viralrespiratory infections from the care of high-riskpatients during community outbreaks of RSVand influenza. 488 F. PREGNANT PERSONNEL Immunologic changes occur during pregnancy, primarily depression of certain aspects of cell-medi-ated immunity such as decreased levels of helper Tcells. These changes permit fetal development with-out rejection but generally do not increase maternalsusceptibility to infectious diseases. Occupationalacquisition of infections is of special concern tofemale health care personnel of childbearing age forseveral reasons. Some infections, such as varicella,may be more severe during pregnancy.Transplacental infections with viruses such as par-vovirus, varicella, and rubella have been associatedwith abortion, congenital anomaly, and mentalretardation. Other diseases in which the infectiousagent may be transmitted to the fetus include CMV,hepatitis B, herpes simplex, influenza, and measles.In addition, certain drugs used to treat or preventsome infections, for example tuberculosis, may becontraindicated during pregnancy. In general, pregnant health care personnel do not have an increased risk for acquiring infectionsin the workplace. The risks to pregnant personnel and methods for prevention are discussed in thevarious sections of this document and are sum-marized in Table 6. Female personnel of child-bearing age should be strongly encouraged toreceive immunizations for vaccine-preventablediseases before pregnancy. Such personnel mayalso decrease their risk of acquiring infection byadhering to appropriate infection control prac-tices, including standard precautions when caringfor all patients. Additional information on occu-pational risks for pregnant health care personnelhas been published elsewhere. 489-491 G. LABORATORY PERSONNEL Despite the availability of improved engineering controls, work practices, and personal protectiveequipment, laboratory personnel remain at riskfor occupational acquisition of infectiousagents. 5,18,53,151,162,241,492,493Furthermore, newer technologies that require the use of large or con-centrated specimens may further increase the riskof occupationally acquired infections among lab-oratory personnel. 494 In a review of laboratory-acquired infections from 1950 through 1974, more than 4000 labora-tory-associated infections were documented inthe United States 492; the 10 most commonly reported infections were brucellosis, Q fever,hepatitis (especially also caused by a wide vari-ety of other pathogens. 162,492,493More recently, viral agents have accounted for a larger propor-tion of laboratory-associated infections thanhave bacterial agents. 493-498 Laboratory personnel may acquire infection by aerosolization of specimens, mouth pipetting, orpercutaneous injury. Information on the risks oflaboratory-associated infections and appropriatebiosafety procedures and precautions for labora-tories have been published. 5, 6, 494, 499, 500 In addition to biosafety precautions, preventive measures (e.g., immunizations and postexposureprophylaxis) may also be indicated for laboratorypersonnel who handle infectious agents. In thisdocument, disease-specific information and guid-ance are provided for prevention of laboratory-associated infections and for management of labo-ratory personnel exposed to infectious agents.Health care institutions need to ensure that labo-ratory personnel who may be exposed to infectiousAJIC 324 CDC Personnel Health Guideline June 1998AJIC Volume 26, Number 3 CDC Personnel Health Guideline 325 agents are well informed about the risks of acquir- ing infections and about biosafety procedures toprevent transmission of infectious agents. H. EMERGENCY-RESPONSE PERSONNEL Emergency medical technicians, firefighters, policemen, and others who attend to and trans-port patients to the hospital may be exposed torecognized or undiagnosed transmissible infec-tious diseases in the patients with whom theycome in contact. Subtitle B (42 USC 300ff-80) ofthe 1990 Ryan White Comprehensive AIDSResources Emergency Act requires the establish-ment of notification systems in each state toensure that emergency-response employees(including emergency medical technicians, fire-fighters, and the like) are informed when theyhave been exposed to an emergency medicalpatient with an infectious, potentially fatal diseasesuch as HIV or meningococcemia. CDC publisheda list of diseases for which emergency-responseemployees must be informed of an exposure. 501 I. LATEX HYPERSENSITIVITY Since the introduction of universal precautions, the use of latex gloves has become commonplacein health care settings. 31,502The increased use of latex gloves has been accompanied by increasingreports of allergic reactions to natural rubberlatex among health care personnel. 503-508 Natural rubber latex is a combination of heat- and water-soluble proteins derived from the treeHevea braziliensis . Reactions to latex gloves may be localized or systemic and include dermatitis,conjunctivitis, rhinitis, urticaria, angioedema,asthma, and anaphylaxis. 509-512Most with latex glove use are notimmunologically mediated from chem-icals (e.g., thiurams, during 513-515It may be clinically difficult to dif- ferentiate irritant reactions from allergic contactdermatitis reactions; both may be manifested byitching, dryness, erythema, bleeding, or scaling ofthe hands. Nevertheless, neither of the types oflocal reactions to latex gloves are good predictorsof latex allergy 503, 516; only a subset of health care personnel reporting glove-associated skin irrita-tion will have immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibod-ies specific for latex. 513, 517-519 In contrast, systemic reactions to natural rub- ber latex, including urticaria, are mediated byantilatex IgE antibodies 509,520,521and may resultfrom direct skin contact or from exposure to air- borne latex allergen adsorbed to glove powder.Occupational asthma from latex is becomingincreasingly recognized. 520,522-524Asthmatic responses to latex may occur early (<8 hours) orlate (>8 hours) after exposure. 525-527 Local reactions (i.e., irritant or allergic contact dermatitis) to latex gloves account for mostreported reactions among health care person-nel. 503,506The risk of progression from localized to systemic reactions is unknown. Latex gloves may vary considerably in total protein content from brand to brand and fromlot to lot within brands. 528,529However, the total protein concentrations and allergenicity of latexgloves are not always directly correlated, 528sug- gesting that total protein concentrations are notnecessarily a measure of the allergenic proper-ties of latex gloves. Currently, the amount oflatex allergen exposure required to produce sen-sitization or to elicit reactions in previously sen-sitized persons is unknown. The FDA has man-dated labeling of all medical devices that containnatural rubber latex. 530 Another recognized contributor to latex sensiti- zation and reactions is the powder or cornstarchused as a lubricant for gloves. Levels ofextractable protein and allergen in a given glovehave been shown to be correlated with the pres-ence of powder. Also, investigators have demon-strated that latex proteins adhere to the powderon gloves and that aerosolized latex protein-pow-der particles can provoke allergic respiratorysymptoms if inhaled by a latex-sensitive individ-ual 531; similar adherence has not been detected with powdered vinyl gloves. In one study, person-nel wearing powdered latex gloves had a signifi-cantly higher rate of reaction than did workerswho wore washed latex gloves, from which thepowder had been removed (60% vs 28%); none ofthese workers had positive skin-test reactions toindustrial or commercial cornstarch or powder. 504 Although many health care personnel or clini-cians may implicate the powder or cornstarch ongloves as the cause of their reactions, documentedreactions to cornstarch powder are rare. a.Prevalence and risk factors In studies of health care personnel, the reported prevalence of IgE-mediated allergy to latex variesconsiderably, ranging from 2.9% to 17%. Thebroad range of prevalence rates reported likelyrepresent differences in the personnel groupsstudied and the methods used for estimating sen-sitization or allergy. 518,519,522,532,533The prevalenceAJIC 326 CDC Personnel Health Guideline June 1998 detected in some studies also has been biased by enrollment or testing of only personnel withsymptoms. 504,508However, it is estimated that a minority of health care personnel seek medicalevaluation or treatment for latex-allergic condi-tions, even if they have symptoms. Thus, the trueprevalence of these reactions among health carepersonnel is unknown. The prevalence of sensitization to latex among health care personnel has been shown to vary byjob category and by location within a facility. 506,533 In one study of 224 health care personnel, theoverall prevalence of skin-prick reactivity to latexwas 17% but ranged and workers to 38% (5/13) amongdental residents and assistants. 506In another sur- vey of 512 health care personnel, the prevalenceamong physicians (6.5%, 7/108) was greater 9/145) were significantly more like-ly to be sensitized than were personnel assigned togeneral wards or laboratories (1.6%, 6/367); oper-ating room nurses had fourfold the prevalence ofgeneral ward nurses (5.6% vs 1.2%). 533 Measurable levels of latex aeroallergen have beendetected in the breathing zones of operating roompersonnel and may vary as much as 100-fold,depending on the invasiveness of the procedureand frequency of glove changes. 534 Several factors have been linked with latex sen- sitization among health care personnel, includingthe presence of other allergic conditions (e.g.,asthma, eczema, hay fever), 503,516,518,519,522,532,533 nonwhite ethnicity,519,532elevated total IgE lev- to cosmetic powders foods,535 years or status (full-time vs part-time) of employ-ment, and frequency or duration of gloveuse. 503,516,522,533Coexistent allergy to certain fruits (e.g., bananas,536,537avocados,538,539and chest- nuts540) also has been described in latex-allergic health care personnel. Skin irritation and eczematous dermatitis516,533 (conditions that may allow passage of latex pro-teins through the skin) and use of other latexproducts (e.g., condoms, diaphragms) have notbeen consistently linked to latex sensitization inhealth care personnel. b.Diagnosis and identification Diagnosis of latex allergy in personnel relies largely on a clinical history of symptoms elicitedby exposure to latex products (e.g., balloons,gloves). Clinical symptoms, such as urticaria, maybe good predictors of IgE-medicated allergy. 516,519A variety of methods have been used to aid in the identification of latex-allergic persons; mostare experimental and have not been approved forclinical use. Skin-prick testing may be the mostsensitive method for diagnosis of IgE-mediatedallergy, but no standardized FDA-approved anti-gen is currently available in the United States fordetection of latex-specific IgE antibodies.Moreover, the use of some skin-test inhighly sensitized persons been associatedwith adverse outcomes, 541suggesting that these nonstandardized reagents may not be safe for rou-tine use. In Europe, where a standardized testingantigen has been developed, skin-prick testing hasbeen used successfully. FDA-approved immunoassays are available for detection of latex-specific IgE antibodies in blood.The FDA has recommended that these assays beused as confirmatory tests, rather than screeningtests, for persons in whom latex allergy is sus-pected on the basis of clinical history and find-ings. Levels of detectable antibody appear to beassociated with symptoms, 504,519but, as with other allergens, the correlation between serum concen-trations of latex-specific IgE antibodies and symp-tom severity may not be predictable. 312,504,516 c.Prevention strategies Avoiding latex products remains the cornerstone of preventing sensitization (primary prevention)and reactions (secondary prevention) to naturalrubber latex products. Proposed strategies toreduce the risk of reactions to natural rubber latexhave included the use of the following: (a) nonla-tex (e.g., vinyl) products alone or in combinationwith latex gloves, (b) powder-free latex gloves, (c)powdered latex gloves washed to remove powder,and (d) \"low-protein\" latex gloves. However, noneof these interventions has been prospectively stud-ied in controlled trials to assess cost-effectivenessor efficacy in preventing sensitization or reactions. Because latex proteins can be aerosolized when powdered gloves are donned or removed, systemicsymptoms caused by latex aeroallergens may notbe alleviated by simply avoiding latex products,particularly if coworkers of the affected workercontinue to use powdered latex gloves. Althoughthe risk of a worker's exposure is greatest whengloves are donned or removed, allergenic proteinsalso may settle on environmental surfaces, surgi-cal gowns, or other clothing and become resus-pended. The use of powder-free or low-proteingloves appears more effective and less costly thaneither laminar-flow or high-efficiency particulateair-filtered glove-changing stations in reducingAJIC Volume 26, Number 3 CDC Personnel Health Guideline 327 latex aeroallergens.534For personnel with sys- temic manifestations of latex allergy, workplacerestriction or reassignment may be necessary. J. THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT The Americans With Disabilities Act provides guidelines for hiring and placing employeeswith disabilities, as defined in the Act. 542-545In general, employers must assess applicants fortheir qualifications to perform the tasks inher-ent to the job for which the employee is beingconsidered. Applicants may be asked about theirability to perform specific job functions but maynot be asked about the existence, nature, orseverity of a disability. Employers must make a\"reasonable accommodation\" to allow an indi-vidual to perform the essential functions of ajob, unless the employer can prove that thiswould create undue hardship because of signifi-cant difficulty or expense. The provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act need to be incorporated into infec-tion control policies for health care personnel. For example, applicants with a communicable diseasespread by aerosol could justifiably be deniedemployment (until they are no longer infectious)because they could pose a direct threat to others.On the other hand, applicants who are immuno-compromised may not necessarily be excludedbecause of an increased risk for acquiring aninfection in the hospital if the employer can makereasonable accommodations that prevent expo-sure. Health care personnel who are known to beimmunocompromised need to be referred to per-sonnel health professionals who can individuallycounsel the employees on their risk for infection.At the request of the immunocompromised healthcare personnel, employers should offer but notcompel a work setting in which health care per-sonnel would have the lowest possible risk foroccupational exposure to infectious agents.Evaluation of individual situations also needs toinclude consideration of the provisions of otherapplicable federal, state, and local laws.A. INTRODUCTION In this document, the term health care personnel refers to all paid and unpaid persons working inhealth care settings who have the potential forexposure to infectious materials including bodysubstances, contaminated medical supplies andequipment, contaminated environmental sur-faces, or contaminated air. These personnel mayinclude but are not limited to physicians, nurses,technicians, therapists, pharmacists, nursingassistants, laboratory personnel, autopsy person-nel, emergency medical service personnel, dentalpersonnel, students and trainees, contractual staffnot employed by the health care facility, and per-sons not directly involved in patient care butpotentially exposed to infectious agents (e.g., vol-unteer, dietary, housekeeping, maintenance, andclerical personnel). As in previous CDC guidelines, each recommen- dation is categorized on the basis of existing sci-entific data, theoretic rationale, applicability, andpotential economic impact. The system for cate-gorizing recommendations is as follows: Category IA Strongly recommended for all hospitals and strongly supported by well-designed experimentalor epidemiologic studies. Category IB Strongly recommended for all hospitals and reviewed as effective by experts in the field anda consensus of Hospital Infection ControlPractices Advisory Committee members on thebasis of strong rationale and suggestive evi-dence, even though definitive scientific studieshave not been done. Category II Suggested for implementation in many hospi- tals. Recommendations may be supported by sug-gestive clinical or epidemiologic studies, a strongtheoretic rationale, or definitive studies applica-ble to some but not all hospitals. No recommendation;unresolved issue Practices for which insufficient evidence or consensus regarding efficacy exists.B. ELEMENTS OF A PERSONNEL HEALTH SERVICE FOR INFECTION CONTROL 1. Coordinated planning and administration a. Coordinate policy making and planning for the personnel health service among the hospi-tal administration, personnel health service,infection control personnel clinical services,pharmacy personnel, various other hospitaldepartments, and relevant external agencies.Include paid and nonpaid personnel (e.g., vol-unteers, trainees, physicians, out-of-hospitaland contractual personnel, and emergencyresponders) in the plan. Category IB b. Establish an active system and develop a writ- ten policy for notifying infection control per-sonnel of (1) infections in personnel (includ-ing volunteers, trainees, contractual person-nel, and out-of-hospital personnel) thatrequire work restrictions or exclusion fromwork, (2) clearance for work after an infec-tious illness that required work restrictions orexclusion, (3) work-related infections andexposures, and when appropriate (4) resultsof epidemiologic investigations. Category IB c. Develop protocols to ensure coordination between the personnel health program, theinfection control program, and other rele-vant departments of the facility. Category IB 2. Placement evaluation a. Before personnel begin duty or are given a new work assignment, conduct health inven-tories. The inventories should include the fol-lowing: (1) immunization status or history ofvaccine-preventable diseases (e.g., chicken-pox, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B)and (2) history of any conditions that maypredispose personnel toward acquiring ortransmitting infectious diseases. Category IB b. Perform directed physical and laboratory examinations on personnel, as indicated bythe results of the health inventory. Includeexaminations to detect conditions that might 328Part II. Recommendations forprevention of infections in health care personnel The Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee Centers for Disease Control and PreventionPublic Health ServiceU.S.Department of Health and Human ServicesAJIC Volume 26, Number 3 CDC Personnel Health Guideline 329 increase the likelihood of transmitting disease to patients or cause unusual susceptibility toinfection, and examinations to serve as abaseline for determining whether any futureproblems are work related. Category IB c. Conduct personnel health assessments other than placement evaluations on an as-neededbasis, for example, as required to evaluatework-related illness or exposures to infec-tious diseases. Category IB d. Do not perform routine cultures on person- nel (e.g., cultures of the nose, throat, orstool) as part of the placement evalua-tion.170 Category IB e. Conduct routine screening for TB by using the intradermal (Mantoux), intermediate-strength(5 tuberculin units) PPD test on personnel whohave potential for exposure to TB. Category II f. Conduct routine serologic screening for some vaccine-preventable diseases, such ashepatitis B, measles, rubella, orvaricella, if deemed to be cost-effective to thehospital and beneficial to the health carepersonnel. Category II 3. Personnel health and safety education a. Provide personnel, annually and whenever the need arises, with in-service training and edu-cation on infection control appropriate andspecific for their work assignments, so thatpersonnel can maintain accurate and up-to-date knowledge about the essential elementsof infection control. Ensure that the followingtopics are included in the initial training oninfection control: (1) handwashing; (2) modesof transmission of infection and importance ofcomplying with standard and transmission-based precautions; (3) importance of report-ing certain illnesses or conditions (whetherwork related or acquired outside the hospital),such as generalized rash or skin lesions thatare vesicular, pustular, or weeping, jaundice,illnesses that do not resolve within a designat-ed period (e.g., a cough that persists for >2weeks, gastrointestinal illness, or febrile illnesswith fever of >103\u00b0 F days), and resulting from febrile or othercontagious diseases; (4) tuberculosis control;(5) importance of complying with standardprecautions and reporting exposure to bloodand body fluids to prevent transmission ofbloodborne pathogens; (6) importance ofcooperating with infection control personnelduring outbreak investigations; and (7) impor-tance of personnel screening and immuniza- tion programs. Category IB b. Ensure that all personnel know whether they have medical conditions or receive medicaltreatment that renders them more suscepti-ble to or more likely to transmit infections,so that they can follow recommendations togreatly reduce their risk of transmitting oracquiring infections (e.g., request for workreassignment). Category IB c. Make specific written policies and procedures for control of infections in health care personnelreadily available to all personnel. Category IB d. Provide educational information appropri- ate, in content and vocabulary, to the educa-tional level, literacy, and language of theemployee. Category IB 4. Job-related illnesses and exposures a. Maintain a record on health care personnel that includes information obtained during themedical evaluation, immunization records,results of tests obtained in any screening orcontrol programs, and reports of work-relatedillnesses or exposures in accordance with stateand federal regulatory requirements. b. Establish a readily available mechanism for personnel to obtain advice about illnessesthey may acquire from or transmit topatients. Category IB c. Develop written protocols for handling job- related and community-acquired infectiousdiseases or important exposures. Record theoccurrences of job-related infectious dis-eases or important exposures in the person'srecord and when applicable notify appropri-ate infection control personnel and membersof the personnel health service. Category IB 5. Record keeping, data management, and confidentiality a. Establish and keep an updated record for all personnel and maintain the confidentialityof their records while ensuring that theyreceive appropriate management for occupa-tional illnesses or exposures. Ensure thatindividual records for volunteers, trainees,contractual personnel, and personnel whoprovide care outside of hospitals are similar-ly kept and maintained. Category IB b. Ensure that when data on personnel health are made public, the individual's confiden-tiality is maintained, for example, by releas-ing only aggregate numbers. Category IBc. Maintain a personnel database, preferably computerized, that allows tracking of personnelimmunizations, screening tests, and assess-ment of trends of infections and diseases in per-sonnel. Copies of their individual records are tobe available to personnel. Category IB d. Periodically review and assess aggregate data gathered on personnel health (e.g., ratesof PPD-test conversion) to determine theneed for action. Category IB e. Ensure that all federal, state, local, and com- munity standards on medical record keepingand confidentiality are met. 26,27Category IB C. PROTECTION OF PERSONNEL AND OTHER PATIENTS FROM PATIENTS WITH INFECTIONS Apply precautions described in the current \"Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hos-pitals\" 3and other guidelines.382Category IB D. IMMUNIZATION OF HEALTH CARE PER- SONNEL, GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Formulate a written comprehensive policy on immunizing health care personnel.Category IB 2. Ensure that persons administering immu- nizing agents are (a) familiar with ACIP rec-ommendations, 8,9(b) well informed about indications, storage, dosage, preparation,side effects, and contraindications for eachof the vaccines, toxoids, and immune globu-lins used, 8,9,24and (c) kept updated on nation- al and local recommendations regarding vac-cination of health care personnel (Tables 1and 2). Category IB 3. Ensure that immunization product informa- tion is available at all times and that a perti-nent health history, especially a history ofallergy and potential vaccine contraindica-tions, is obtained from each person beforean agent is given (Table 2). Category IB 4. Develop a list of needed immunizations for each employee during screening and an indi-vidual plan to provide the necessary vac-cines. Category IB 5. In the absence of a known occupational exposure, provide personnel with on-siteimmunizations or refer personnel to theirown health care providers for routinenon-occupation-related immunizationsagainst diphtheria, pneumococcal disease,hepatitis A, or tetanus (Table 1). Category IB 6. Provide vaccine to personnel who may have occupational exposure to uncommon dis-eases such as plague, typhus, or yellow fever, or refer them to their own health careproviders. Category IB E. PROPHYLAXIS AND FOLLOW-UP AFTER EXPOSURE, GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Ensure that when personnel are offered neces- sary prophylactic treatment with drugs, vac-cines, or immune globulins, they are informedof (a) options for prophylaxis, (b) the risk (ifknown) of infection when treatment is notaccepted, (c) the degree of protection providedby the therapy, and (d) the potential sideeffects of the therapy. Category IB 2. Ensure that when personnel are exposed to particular infectious agents, they are in-formed of (a) the recommended postexpo-sure management that is based on currentknowledge about the epidemiology of theinfection, (b) the risk (if known) of transmit-ting the infection to patients, other person-nel, or other contacts, and (c) the methods ofpreventing transmission of the infection toother persons. Category IB F. PERSONNEL RESTRICTION BECAUSE OF INFECTIOUS ILLNESSES OR SPECIAL CONDI-TIONS, GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Develop well-defined policies concerning contact of personnel with patients whenpersonnel have potentially transmissibleconditions. These policies should govern(a) personnel responsibility in using thehealth service and reporting illness, (b)work restrictions, and (c) clearance forwork after an illness that required workrestriction. Category IB 2. Identify the persons with authority to relieve personnel of duties. Category IB 3. Develop work-exclusion policies that encour- age personnel to report their illnesses orexposures and that do not penalize themwith loss of wages, benefits, or job status.Category IB 4. Educate and encourage personnel who have signs and symptoms of a transmissible infec-tious disease to report their conditionpromptly to their supervisor and occupation-al health. Category IB 5. Provide appropriate education for personnel on the importance of good hygienic prac-tices, especially handwashing and coveringthe nose and mouth when coughing andsneezing.
