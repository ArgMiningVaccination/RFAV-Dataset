Despite its demonstrated efficacy, the conventional pharmacologic approach to the treatment of Herpes zoster often has shortcomings-delayed treatment response times, limited treatment window to prevent PHN, and outright treatment failures. It is obvious in light of the foregoing evidence that other treatment options merit consideration, complementary and/or alternative medical disciplines among them. Homeopathic medicine, based on extensive clinical experience, coupled with its remarkable safety profile and convenience of administration, is one such trials (RCTs) are an established research method to investigate the effects of an intervention. Several recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs with homeopathic interventions have identified shortcomings in design, conduct, analysis, and reporting of trials. Guidelines for RCTs in homeopathic medicine are lacking. OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to fill this gap in order to enhance the quality of RCTs in the field of homeopathy. METHODS: Identification of the homeopathy-specific requirements for RCTs by reviewing literature and experts' communications. Systematization of the findings using a suitable checklist for planning, conducting, and reporting RCTs, namely the SPIRIT statement, and high-quality homeopathy RCTs as examples. Cross-checking of the created checklist with the RedHot-criteria, the PRECIS criteria, and a qualitative evaluation checklist. Consideration of the REFLECT statement and the ARRIVE Guidelines 2.0 for veterinary homeopathy. RESULTS: Recommendations for future implementation of RCTs in homeopathy are summarized in a checklist. Alongside, identified useful solutions to the issues encountered when designing and conducting homeopathy RCTs are presented. CONCLUSIONS: The formulated recommendations present guidelines additional to those in the SPIRIT checklist, on how to better plan, design, conduct, and report RCTs in homeopathy.

A substantial proportion of adults and children in the United States use complementary and alternative health practices, including homeopathy. Many homeopathic therapies are readily available over the counter, and many individuals access and self-administer these therapies with little or no guidance from health care practitioners. In addition, patients and health care providers are often confused by terminologies associated with complementary practices and may be unable to distinguish homeopathy from naturopathy, herbalism, holistic medicine, Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, or other forms of health care. Compared with European and Asian countries, education in the United States about complementary and alternative health practices is not typically found within traditional nursing, midwifery, or medical education curricula. Given this lack of education and the broad acceptance and popularity of homeopathy, it is necessary for health care practitioners to improve their knowledge regarding similarities and differences among therapies so they can fully inform and make appropriate recommendations to patients. The intent of this article is therefore to examine the state of existing science of homeopathy, distinguish it from other complementary methods, and provide midwives and women's health care providers with an introduction to common homeopathic therapies that may be recommended and safely used by persons seeking midwifery care. This review also presents the evidence base, pharmacology, manufacturing, and regulation of homeopathic therapies. We also consider controversies and misunderstandings regarding safety and efficacy of homeopathic remedies relevant to women and birthing persons. Examples of practical applications of homeopathic therapies for use in midwifery practice are introduced.
