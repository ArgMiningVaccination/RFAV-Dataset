Maternal Influenza Infection During Pregnancy Impacts Postnatal Brain Development in the Rhesus Monkey Abstract: \"Background\u2014Maternal infection with influenza and other pathogens during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk for schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders. In rodent studies, maternal inflammatory responses to influenza affect fetal brain development. However, to verify the relevance of these findings to humans, research is needed in a primate species with more advanced prenatal corticogenesis. Methods\u2014Twelve pregnant rhesus monkeys were infected with influenza, A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2), 1 month before term (early third trimester) and compared with 7 control pregnancies. Nasal swabs and blood samples confirmed viral shedding and immune activation. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was conducted at 1 year; behavioral development and cortisol reactivity were also assessed. Results\u2014Maternal infections were mild and self-limiting. At birth, maternally derived influenzaspecific immunoglobulin G was present in the neonate, but there was no evidence of direct viral exposure. Birth weight and gestation length were not affected, nor were infant neuromotor, behavioral, and endocrine responses. However, magnetic resonance imaging analyses revealed significant reductions in cortical gray matter in flu-exposed animals. Regional analyses indicated the largest gray matter reductions occurred bilaterally in cingulate and parietal areas; white matter was also reduced significantly in the parietal lobe. Conclusions\u2014Influenza infection during pregnancy affects neural development in the monkey, reducing gray matter throughout most of the cortex and decreasing white matter in parietal cortex. These brain alterations are likely to be permanent, given that they were still present at the monkeyequivalent of older childhood and thus might increase the likelihood of later behavioral pathology\" \"Background\u2014Maternal infection with influenza and other pathogens during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk for schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Neonatal vaccination with bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin promotes the dendritic development of hippocampal neurons Abstract: \"Dendritic structure is sensitive to changes in the environment during brain development. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that early immune activation can significantly affect neuronal development. Our study concentrated on the morphological study of neural dendrites and spines in the hippocampal area using Diolistic labeling with Sholl analysis and fractal analysis. The results revealed that Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination enhanced dendritic complexity, as reflected by the increased number of intersections, number of branch points and fractal dimension, and promoted neurite outgrowth. In addition, BCG increased the density and promoted the maturation of dendritic spines. The alterations in dendritic structure and spine morphology were observed at 2 and 4 w, but the differences were more apparent at 4 w than at 2 w. However, no significant difference was observed at 8 w. Furthermore, we observed that BCG increased the expression of hippocampal brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth correlated with apical dendritic length, fractal dimension, and spine density. Taken together, we show in this study that neonatal BCG vaccination promotes dendritic development in developing hippocampal CA1 neurons, most likely by increasing the expression of BDNF and IGF-1 in the hippocampus.\" \"Dendritic structure is sensitive to changes in the environment during brain development.

Consistently, blockade of endogenous IL-1 or IL-6 restricts or favours hippocampal-dependent memory, effects that were confirmed in genetically manipulated mice. Since cytokines are known for their high degree of mutual crosstalk, here we studied whether a network of cytokines with known neuromodulatory actions is activated during LTP and learning. We found that, besides IL-1b and IL-6, also IL-1 receptor antagonist not TNFa are over-expressed during LTP maintenance in freely moving rats. The increased expression of these cytokines is causally related to an increase in synaptic strength since it was abrogated when LTP was interfered by blockade of NMDA-glutamate receptors. Likewise, IL-1 and IL-6 were found to be over-expressed in defined regions of the hippocampus during learning a hippocampus-dependent task. However, during learning, changes in IL-18 were restricted to the dorsal hippocampus, and no differences in TNFa and IL1-ra expression were noticed in the hippocampus. Noticeably, IL-1ra transcripts were significantly reduced in the prefrontal cortex. The relation between cytokine expression and learning was causal because such changes were not observed in animals from a pseudo-trained group that was subject to the same manipulation but could not learn the task. Taken together with previous studies, we conclude that activation of a cytokine network in the brain is a physiologic relevant phenomenon not only for LTP maintenance but also for certain types of learning.\" Link: \"We have previously shown hippocampal IL-1b and IL-6 overexpression, and interfering their signalling either inhibits or supports, respectively, LTP maintenance.

Aberrant Immune Responses in a Mouse with Behavioral Disorders Abstract: \"BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) mice have recently been reported to have behaviors that resemble those of autistic individuals, in that this strain has impairments in social interactions and a restricted repetitive and stereotyped pattern of behaviors. Since immune responses, including autoimmune responses, are known to affect behavior, and individuals with autism have aberrant immune activities, we evaluated the immune system of BTBR mice, and compared their immunity and degree of neuroinflammation with that of C57BL/6 (B6) mice, a highly social control strain, and with F1 offspring. Mice were assessed at postnatal day (pnd) 21 and after behavioral analysis at pnd70. BTBR mice had significantly higher amounts of serum IgG and IgE, of IgG anti-brain antibodies (Abs), and of IgG and IgE deposited in the brain, elevated expression of cytokines, especially IL-33 IL-18, and IL-1b in the brain, and an increased proportion of MHC class II-expressing microglia compared to B6 mice. The F1 mice had intermediate levels of Abs and cytokines as well as social activity. The high Ab levels of BTBR mice are in agreement with their increased numbers of CD40hi/I-Ahi B cells and IgG-secreting B cells. Upon immunization with KLH, the BTBR mice produced 2-3 times more anti-KLH Abs than B6 mice. In contrast to humoral immunity, BTBR mice are significantly more susceptible to listeriosis than B6 or BALB/c mice. The Th2-like immune profile of the BTBR mice and their constitutive neuroinflammation suggests that an autoimmune profile is implicated in their aberrant behaviors, as has been suggested for some humans with autism.\" Link: \"BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) mice have recently been reported to have behaviors that resemble those of autistic individuals, in that this strain has impairments in social interactions and a restricted repetitive and stereotyped pattern of behaviors.

Activation of the Maternal Immune System During Pregnancy Alters Behavioral Development of Rhesus Monkey Offspring Abstract: \"Background: Maternal infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia and autism in the offspring. Supporting this correlation, experimentally activating the maternal immune system during pregnancy in rodents produces offspring with abnormal brain and behavioral development. We have developed a nonhuman primate model to bridge the gap between clinical populations and rodent models of maternal immune activation (MIA). Methods: A modified form of the viral mimic, synthetic double-stranded RNA (polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid stabilized with poly-L-lysine) was delivered to two separate groups of pregnant rhesus monkeys to induce MIA: 1) late first trimester MIA (n \u00bc 6), and 2) late second trimester MIA (n \u00bc 7). Control animals (n \u00bc 11) received saline injections at the same first or second trimester time points or were untreated. Sickness behavior, temperature, and cytokine profiles of the pregnant monkeys confirmed a strong inflammatory response to MIA. Results: Behavioral development of the offspring was studied for 24 months. Following weaning at 6 months of age, MIA offspring exhibited abnormal responses to separation from their mothers. As the animals matured, MIA offspring displayed increased repetitive behaviors and decreased affiliative vocalizations. When evaluated with unfamiliar conspecifics, first trimester MIA offspring deviated from species-typical macaque social behavior by inappropriately approaching and remaining in immediate proximity of an unfamiliar animal. Conclusions: In this rhesus monkey model, MIA yields offspring with abnormal repetitive behaviors, communication, and social interactions. These results extended the findings in rodent MIA models to more human-like behaviors resembling those in both autism and schizophrenia.\" Link: \"Background: Maternal infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia and autism in the offspring.

Activation of the Maternal Immune System Induces Endocrine Changes in the Placenta via IL-6 Abstract: \"Activation of the maternal immune system in rodent models sets in motion a cascade of molecular pathways that ultimately result in autism- and schizophrenia-related behaviors in offspring. The finding that interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a crucial mediator of these effects led us to examine the mechanism by which this cytokine influences fetal development in vivo. Here we focus on the placenta as the site of direct interaction between mother and fetus and as a principal modulator of fetal development. We find that maternal immune activation (MIA) with a viral mimic, synthetic double-stranded RNA (poly(I:C)), increases IL-6 mRNA as well as maternally-derived IL-6 protein in the placenta. Placentas from MIA mothers increases in CD69+ decidual macrophages, granulocytes and uterine NK cells, indicating elevated immune activation. Maternally-derived IL-6 mediates activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway specifically in the spongiotrophoblast layer of the placenta, which results in expression of acute phase genes. Importantly, this parallels an IL-6-dependent disruption of the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor (GH-IGF) axis that is characterized by decreased GH, IGFI and IGFBP3 levels. In addition, we observe an IL-6-dependent induction in pro-lactin-like protein-K (PLP-K) expression as well as alterations in other placental endocrine factors. Together, these IL-6- mediated effects of MIA on the placenta represent an indirect mechanism by which MIA can alter fetal development.'

Activation of the Maternal Immune System Alters Cerebellar Development in the Offspring Abstract: \"A common pathological finding in autism is a localized deficit in Purkinje cells (PCs). Cerebellar abnormalities have also been reported in schizophrenia. Using a mouse model that exploits a known risk factor for these disorders, maternal infection, we asked if the offspring of pregnant mice given a mid-gestation respiratory infection have cerebellar pathology resembling that seen in these disorders. We also tested the effects of maternal immune activation in the absence of virus by injection of the synthetic dsRNA, poly(I:C). We infected pregnant mice with influenza on embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5), or injected poly(I:C) i.p. on E12.5, and assessed the linear density of PCs in the cerebellum of adult or postnatal day 11 (P11) offspring. To study granule cell migration, we also injected BrdU on P11. Adult offspring of influenza- or poly(I:C)-exposed mice display a localized deficit in PCs in lobule VII of the cerebellum, as do P11 offspring. Coincident with this are heterotopic PCs, as well as delayed migration of granule cells in lobules VI and VII. The cerebellar pathology observed in the offspring of influenza- or poly(I:C)-exposed mice is strikingly similar to that observed in autism. The poly(I:C) findings indicate that deficits are likely caused by the activation of the maternal immune system. Finally, our data suggest that cerebellar abnormalities occur during embryonic development, and may be an early deficit in autism and schizophrenia.\" Link: \"A common pathological finding in autism is a localized deficit in Purkinje cells (PCs).

Adult brain and behavioral pathological markers of prenatal immune challenge during early/middle and late fetal development in mice Abstract: \"Maternal infection during pregnancy increases the risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism in the offspring. This association appears to be critically dependent on the precise prenatal timing. However, the extent to which distinct adult psychopathological and neuropathological traits may be sensitive to the precise times of prenatal immune activation remains to be further characterized. Here, we evaluated in a mouse model of prenatal immune challenge by the viral mimic, polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (PolyIC), whether prenatal immune activation in early/middle and late gestation may influence the susceptibility to some of the critical cognitive, pharmacological, and neuroanatomical dysfunctions implicated in schizophrenia and autism. We revealed that PolyIC-induced prenatal immune challenge on gestation day (GD) 9 but not GD17 significantly impaired sensorimotor gating and reduced prefrontal dopamine D1 receptors in adulthood, whereas prenatal immune activation specifically in late gestation impaired working memory, potentiated the locomotor reaction to the NMDA-receptor antagonist dizocilpine, and reduced hippocampal NMDA-receptor subunit 1 expression. On the other hand, potentiation of the locomotor reaction to the dopamine-receptor agonist amphetamine and reduction in Reelin- and Parvalbumin-expressing prefrontal neurons emerged independently of the precise times of prenatal immune challenge. Our findings thus highlight that prenatal immune challenge during early/middle and late fetal development in mice leads to distinct brain and behavioral pathological symptom clusters in adulthood. Further examination and evaluation of in utero immune challenge at different times of gestation may provide important new insight into the neuroimmunological and neuropathological mechanisms underlying the segregation of different symptom clusters in heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism.\" Link: \"Maternal infection during pregnancy increases the risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism in the offspring.

Allergic fetal priming leads to developmental, behavioral and neurobiological changes in mice Abstract: \"The state of the mother's immune system during pregnancy has an important role in fetal development and disruptions in the balance of this system are associated with a range of neurologic, neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Epidemiological and clinical reports reveal various clues that suggest a possible association between developmental neuropsychiatric disorders and family history of immune system dysfunction. Over the past three decades, analogous increases have been reported in both the incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders and immune-related disorders, particularly allergy and asthma, raising the question of whether allergic asthma and characteristics of various neurodevelopmental disorders share common causal links. We used a mouse model of maternal allergic asthma to test this novel hypothesis that early fetal priming with an allergenic exposure during gestation produces behavioral deficits in offspring. Mothers were primed with an exposure to ovalbumin (OVA) before pregnancy, then exposed to either aerosolized OVA or vehicle during gestation. Both male and female mice born to mothers exposed to aerosolized OVA during gestation exhibited altered developmental trajectories in weight and length, decreased sociability and increased marble-burying behavior. Moreover, offspring of OVA-exposed mothers were observed to have increased serotonin transporter protein levels in the cortex. These data demonstrate that behavioral and neurobiological effects can be elicited following early fetal priming with maternal allergic asthma and provide support that maternal allergic asthma may, in some cases, be a contributing factor to neurodevelopmental disorders.\" Link: \"The state of the mother's immune system during pregnancy has an important role in fetal development and disruptions in the balance of this system are associated with a range of neurologic, neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Allergic rhinitis induces anxiety-like behavior and altered social interaction in rodents Abstract: \"Epidemiological and clinical studies report higher incidences of anxiety and increased emotional reactivity in individuals suffering from respiratory allergies. To evaluate if respiratory allergies are capable of promoting anxiety-like behavior in rodents, we used models of allergic rhinitis and behavioral evaluations followed by assessment of mRNA for cytokines in relevant brain regions. Mice and rats were sensitized to ovoalbumin or pollen respectively following standard sensitization and challenge protocols. After challenge, the animals were evaluated in the open field, elevated plus maze and resident intruder tests. Cytokines and corticotropin releasing factor expression were assessed in several brain regions by real-time RT-PCR and plasma corticostereone concentrations by radioimmunoassay. Mice and rats sensitized and exposed to allergen showed increased anxietylike behavior and reduced social interaction without any overt behavioral signs of sickness. T-helper type 2 (TH2) cytokines were induced in both rats and mice in the olfactory bulbs and prefrontal cortex and remained unchanged in the temporal cortex and hypothalamus. The same results were found for CRF mRNA expression. No differences were observed in corticosterone concentrations one hour after the last behavioral test. These results show that sensitization and challenge with allergens induce anxiety across rodent species and that these effects were paralleled by an increased expression of TH2 cytokines and CRF in the prefrontal cortex.

Alteration of brain volume in IL-6 overexpressing mice related to autism Abstract: \"Abnormal neuroimmune responses have been reported to be associated with autism and could be appropriate targets for pharmacologic intervention.

The IL-6 overexpressing mice displayed several autism-like features as well as an abnormal dendritic spine morphology and synaptic function. The purpose of this study was to examine the volumetric differences in the brain of IL-6 overexpressing mice and compare with corresponding control mice using magnetic resonance imaging. Here we show that IL-6 overexpressing mice display an increase in the total brain volume. In addition, the lateral ventricle is also enlarged in the IL-6 overexpressing mice. The brain structures surrounding the lateral ventricle were squeezed and deformed from the normal location. These results indicate that IL-6 elevation in the brain could mediate neuroanatomical abnormalities.

Altered neural cortical circuits in autism Abstract: \"Converging evidence from diverse studies suggests that atypical brain connectivity in autism affects in distinct ways short- and long-range cortical pathways, disrupting neural communication and the balance of excitation and inhibition. This hypothesis is based mostly on functional non-invasive studies that show atypical synchronization and connectivity patterns between cortical areas in children and adults with autism. Indirect methods to study the course and integrity of major brain pathways at low resolution show changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) or diffusivity of the white matter in autism. Findings in post-mortem brains of adults with autism provide evidence of changes in the fine structure of axons below prefrontal cortices, which communicate over short- or long-range pathways with other cortices and subcortical structures.

This hypothesis is based mostly on functional non-invasive studies that show atypical synchronization and connectivity patterns between cortical areas in children and adults with autism. Indirect methods to study the course and integrity of major brain pathways at low resolution show changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) or diffusivity of the white matter in autism. Findings in post-mortem brains of adults with autism provide evidence of changes in the fine structure of axons below prefrontal cortices, which communicate over short- or long-range pathways with other cortices and subcortical structures.

Altered nociceptive, endocrine, and dorsal horn neuron responses in rats following a neonatal immune challenge Abstract: \"The neonatal period is characterized by significant plasticity where the immune, endocrine, and nociceptive systems undergo fine-tuning and maturation. Painful experiences during this period can result in long-term alterations in the neurocircuitry underlying nociception, including increased sensitivity to mechanical orthermal stimuli. Less is known about the impact of neonatal exposure to mild inflammatory stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), on subsequent inflammatory pain responses. Here we examine the impact of neonatal LPS exposure on inflammatory pain sensitivity and HPA axis activity during the first three postnatal weeks. Wistar rats were injected with LPS (0.05 mg/kg IP, Salmonella enteritidis) orsaline on postnatal days(PNDs) 3 and 5 and later subjected to the formalin test at PNDs 7, 13, and 22. One hour after formalin injection, blood was collected to assess corticosterone responses. Transverse spinal cord slices were also prepared for whole-cell patch clamp recording from lumbar superficial dorsal horn neurons (SDH). Brains were obtained at PND 22 and the hypothalamus was isolated to measure glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) transcript expression using qRT-PCR. Behavioural analyses indicate that at PND 7, no significant differences were observed between saline- or LPS-challenged rats. At PND 13, LPS-challenged rats exhibited enhanced licking ( p < .01), and at PND 22, increased flinching in response to formalin injection ( p < .05).

Complement involvement in the adjuvant properties of Al(OH)3 has been suggested in several reports together with a depot effect. It is here confirmed that Al(OH)3 treatment of serum depletes complement components and activates the complement system. We show that complement activation by Al(OH)3 involves the three major pathways by monitoring complement components in Al(OH)3-treated serum and in Al(OH)3-containing precipitates. Al(OH)3 activation of complement results in deposition of C3 cleavage products and membrane attack complex (MAC) and in generation of the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a. Complement activation was time dependent and inhibited by chelation with EDTA but not EGTA+Mg2+ . We thus confirm that Al(OH)3 activates the complement system and show that the alternative pathway is of major importance.\" Link: \"Al(OH)3 is the most common adjuvant in human vaccines, but its mode of action remains poorly understood.

Atopic diseases and inflammation of the brain in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders Abstract: \"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) affect as many as 1 in 45 children and are characterized by deficits in sociability and communication, as well as stereotypic movements. Many children also show severe anxiety. The lack of distinct pathogenesis and reliable biomarkers hampers the development of effective treatments. As a result, most children with ASD are prescribed psychopharmacologic agents that do not address the core symptoms of ASD. Autoantibodies against brain epitopes in mothers of children with ASD and many such children strongly correlate with allergic symptoms and indicate an aberrant immune response, as well as disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Recent epidemiological studies have shown a strong statistical correlation between risk for ASD and either maternal or infantile atopic diseases, such as asthma, eczema, food allergies and food intolerance, all of which involve activation of mast cells (MCs). These unique tissue immune cells are located perivascularly in all tissues, including the thalamus and hypothalamus, which regulate emotions. MC-derived inflammatory and vasoactive mediators increase BBB permeability. Expression of the inflammatory molecules interleukin (IL-1), IL-6, 1 L-17 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is increased in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid and serum of some patients with ASD, while NF-kB is activated in brain samples and stimulated peripheral blood immune cells of other patients; however, these molecules are not specific. Instead the peptide neurotensin is uniquely elevated in the serum of children with ASD, as is corticotropin-releasing hormone, secreted from the hypothalamus under stress. Both peptides trigger MC to release IL-6 and TNF, which in turn, stimulate microglia proliferation and activation, leading to disruption of neuronal connectivity. MC-derived IL-6 and TGF induce maturation of Th17 cells and MCs also secrete IL-17, which is increased in ASD. Serum IL-6 and TNF may define an ASD subgroup that benefits most from treatment with the natural flavonoid luteolin. Atopic diseases may create a phenotype susceptible to ASD and formulations targeting focal inflammation of the brain could have great promise in the treatment of ASD.\" Link: \"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) affect as many as 1 in 45 children and are characterized by deficits in sociability and communication, as well as stereotypic movements.

Autism with Intellectual Disability is Associated with Increased Levels of Maternal Cytokines and Chemokines During Gestation \"Immune abnormalities have been described in some individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) as well as their family members. However, few studies have directly investigated the role of prenatal cytokine and chemokine profiles on neurodevelopmental outcomes in humans. In the current study, we characterized mid-gestational serum profiles of 22 cytokines and chemokines in mothers of children with ASD (N=415), developmental delay without ASD (DD) (N=188), and general population (GP) controls (N=428) using a bead-based multiplex technology. The ASD group was further divided into those with intellectual disabilities (DQ either ASD-noID, those with DD, or GP controls. Conversely, mothers of children with either ASD-noID or with DD had significantly lower levels of the chemokines IL-8 and MCP-1 compared to mothers of GP controls. This observed immunologic distinction between mothers of children with ASD+ID from mothers of children with ASD-noID or DD suggests that the intellectual disability (ID) associated with ASD might be etiologically distinct from DD without ASD. These findings contribute to the ongoing efforts toward identification of early biological markers specific to sub-phenotypes of ASD.\" Link: Link: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27217154](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27217154) 17. Timetables of Neurogenesis in the Human Brain Based on Experimentally Determined Patterns in the Rat\" Abstract: \"The first aim of this paper is to link our developmental studies ofthe rat central nervoussystem (CNS) to development of the human CNS. A paper similar to this one will appear in another publication for neuropathologists (Bayer et aI., in press). Using quantitative [3H]thymidine autoradiography in rats, we have found that one of the most regular features ofCNS development is that each neuronal population is generated during a specific temporal window, what we call timetables of neurogenesis. By linking the morphological appearances of human and rat embryos or fetuses at several different developmental stages, this paper shows how rat neurogenetic timetables can be extrapolated to human neurogenetic timetables. The time of origin of all major neuronal populations in the CNS will be summarized here in a tabular form that links them to the probable times of origin in man. It is our hope that these timetables will be a reference for neurotoxicologists and pediatric neurologists dealing with developmental abnormalities in the human CNS. In addition to time of origin studies, much ofour [3H]thymidine autoradiographic work deals with cell migration. Because the regularity of neurogenesis sets the stage for coordinated events between different neuronal populations such as neuronal migration, axonogenesis, dendrogenesis and synaptogenesis, we will briefly summarize the times and trajectories of migratory pathways and the initiation of axonal and dendritic growth for the neuronal populations that we have studied up to this time. The second aim of this paper is to derive some basic principles of neuroanatomical development at the tissue and cellular levels that have been empirically established in rats and probably occur in man. There is growing evidence that the germinal source of neurons is as heterogeneous as their offspring and forms a spatiotemporal mosaic. It can truly be said that neurogenesis occurs in a \"chronoarchitectonic\" pattern. A series of diagrams will be used to illustrate what we mean by mosaicism in the germinal zones. Finally, the chronology ofneurogenesisin two related neuronal populations often correlates with the anatomical connections between them (Bayer and Altman, 1987a). In this chapter, a brief summary of that generalization will be presented using the anatomical connections between the substantia nigra and the striatum as an example. The third aim of this paper is to deal with the effects of insulting agents (genetic or environmental) that interfere with the normal pattern of development. Insults that occur during neurogenesis result in hypoplasia, a permanent reduction of the normal number of neurons. Insults that affect cell migration often result in ectopia, the abnormal settling of neurons in inappropriate locations. Finally, insults that occur during axonogenesis, dendrogenesis, and synaptogenesis result in dysplasia, characterized by neurons with aberrantly shaped dendrites and axons that often make inappropriate synaptic contacts.\" Link: \"The first aim of this paper is to link our developmental studies ofthe rat central nervoussystem (CNS) to development of the human CNS.

Mumps, measles, and rubella vaccine and the incidence of autism recorded by general practitioners: a time trend analysis Abstract: \"Objective To estimate changes in the risk of autism and assess the relation of autism to the mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Design Time trend analysis of data from the UK general practice research database (GPRD). Setting General practices in the United Kingdom. Subjects Children aged 12 years or younger diagnosed with autism 1988-99, with further analysis of boys aged 2 to 5 years born 1988-93. Main outcome measures Annual and age specific incidence for first recorded diagnoses of autism (that is, when the diagnosis of autism was first recorded) in the children aged 12 years or younger; annual, birth cohort specific risk of autism diagnosed in the 2 to 5 year old boys; coverage (prevalence) of MMR vaccination in the same birth cohorts. Results The incidence of newly diagnosed autism increased sevenfold, from 0.3 per 10 000 person years in 1988 to 2.1 per 10 000 person years in 1999. The peak incidence was among 3 and 4 year olds, and 83% (254/305) of cases were boys. In an annual birth cohort analysis of 114 boys born in 1988-93, the risk of autism in 2 to 5 year old boys increased nearly fourfold over time, from 8 (95% confidence interval 4 to 14) per 10 000 for boys born in 1988 to 29 (20 to 43) per 10 000 for boys born in 1993. For the same annual birth cohorts the prevalence of MMR vaccination was over 95%. Conclusions Because the incidence of autism among 2 to 5 year olds increased markedly among boys born in each year separately from 1988 to 1993 while MMR vaccine coverage was over 95% for successive annual birth cohorts, the data provide evidence that no correlation exists between the prevalence of MMR vaccination and the rapid increase in the risk of autism over time.

Modeling an autism risk factor in mice leads to permanent immune dysregulation Abstract: \"Increasing evidence highlights a role for the immune system in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as immune dysregulation is observed in the brain, periphery, and gastrointestinal tract of ASD individuals. Furthermore, maternal infection (maternal immune activation, MIA) is a risk factor for ASD. Modeling this risk factor in mice yields offspring with the cardinal behavioral and neuropathological symptoms of human ASD. In this study, we find that offspring of immune-activated mothers display altered immune profiles and function, characterized by a systemic deficit in CD4+ TCR+ Foxp3+ CD25+ T regulatory cells, increased IL-6 and IL-17 production by CD4+ T cells, and elevated levels of peripheral Gr-1+ cells. In addition, hematopoietic stem cells from MIA offspring exhibit altered myeloid lineage potential and differentiation. Interestingly, repopulating irradiated control mice with bone marrow derived from MIA offspring does not confer MIA-related immunological deficits, implicating the peripheral environmental context in long-term programming of immune dysfunction. Furthermore, behaviorally abnormal MIA offspring that have been irradiated and transplanted with immunologically normal bone marrow from either MIA or control offspring no longer exhibit deficits in stereotyped/repetitive and anxiety-like behaviors, suggesting that immune abnormalities in MIA offspring can contribute to ASD-related behaviors. These studies support a link between cellular immune dysregulation and ASD-related behavioral deficits in a mouse model of an autism risk factor.\" Link: \"Increasing evidence highlights a role for the immune system in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as immune dysregulation is observed in the brain, periphery, and gastrointestinal tract of ASD individuals.

Normal Development of Brain Circuits Abstract: \"Spanning functions from the simplest reflex arc to complex cognitive processes, neural circuits have diverse functional roles. In the cerebral cortex, functional domains such as visual processing, attention, memory, and cognitive control rely on the development of distinct yet interconnected sets of anatomically distributed cortical and subcortical regions. The developmental organization of these circuits is a remarkably complex process that is influenced by genetic predispositions, environmental events, and neuroplastic responses to experiential demand that modulates connectivity and communication among neurons, within individual brain regions and circuits, and across neural pathways. Recent advances in neuroimaging and computational neurobiology, together with traditional investigational approaches such as histological studies and cellular and molecular biology, have been invaluable in improving our understanding of these developmental processes in humans in both health and illness. To contextualize the developmental origins of a wide array of neuropsychiatric illnesses, this review describes the development and maturation of neural circuits from the first synapse through critical periods of vulnerability and opportunity to the emergent capacity for cognitive and behavioral regulation, and finally the dynamic interplay across levels of circuit organization and developmental epochs.\" Link: \"Spanning functions from the simplest reflex arc to complex cognitive processes, neural circuits have diverse functional roles.

Brain IL-6 elevation and mediates autism-like behaviors Abstract: \"Abnormal immune responses have been reported to be associated with autism. A number of studies showed that cytokines were increased in the blood, brain, and cerebrospinal fluid of autistic subjects. Elevated IL-6 in autistic brain has been a consistent finding. However, the mechanisms by which IL-6 may be involved in the pathogenesis of autism are not well understood. Here we show that mice with elevated IL-6 in the brain display many autistic features, including impaired cognitive abilities, deficits in learning, abnormal anxiety traits and habituations, as well as decreased social interactions. IL-6 elevation caused alterations in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic formations and disrupted the balance of excitatory/inhibitory synaptic transmissions. IL-6 elevation also resulted in an abnormal change in the shape, length and distributing pattern of dendritic spines. These findings suggest that IL-6 elevation in the brain could mediate autistic-like behaviors, possibly through the imbalances of neural circuitry and impairments of synaptic plasticity.\" Link: \"Abnormal immune responses have been reported to be associated with autism.

Fetal Inflammatory Response and Brain Injury in the Preterm Newborn Abstract: \"Preterm birth can be caused by intrauterine infection and maternal/fetal inflammatory responses. Maternal inflammation (chorioamnionitis) is often followed by a systemic fetal inflammatory response characterized by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the fetal circulation. The inflammation signal is likely transmitted across the blood-brain barrier, and initiates a neuroinflammatory response. Microglial activation has a central role in this process, and triggers excitotoxic, inflammatory, and oxidative damage in the developing brain. Neuroinflammation can persist over a period of time and sensitize the brain to subinjurious insults in early and chronic phases, but may offer relative tolerance in the intermediate period through activation of endogenous anti-inflammatory, protective, and repair mechanisms. Neuroinflammatory injury not only destroys what exists, but also changes what develops.\" Link: \"Preterm birth can be caused by intrauterine infection and maternal/fetal inflammatory responses.

Brain Region-Specific Alterations in the Gene Expression of Cytokines, Immune Cell Markers and Cholinergic System Components during Peripheral Endotoxin-Induced Inflammation Abstract: \"Inflammatory conditions characterized by excessive peripheral immune responses are associated with diverse alterations in brain function, and brain-derived neural pathways regulate peripheral inflammation. Important aspects of this bidirectional peripheral immune-brain communication, including the impact of peripheral inflammation on brain region-specific cytokine responses, and brain cholinergic signaling (which plays a role in controlling peripheral cytokine levels), remain unclear.

Endotoxemia was accompanied by elevated serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and other cytokines and brain region-specific increases in Il1b (the highest increase, relative to basal level, was in cortex; the lowest increase was in cerebellum) and Il6 (highest increase in cerebellum; lowest increase in striatum) mRNA expression.

Brain-Derived in the Serum and Fluid of Children with Viral Infection-Induced Encephalopathy \"We investigated changes in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and interleukin (IL)-6 levels in pediatric patients with central nervous system (CNS) infections, particularly viral infection-induced encephalopathy. Over a 5-year study period, 24 children hospitalized with encephalopathy were grouped based on their acute encephalopathy type (the excitotoxicity, cytokine storm, and metabolic error types). Children without CNS infections served as controls. In serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, BDNF and IL-6 levels were increased in all encephalopathy groups, and significant increases were noted in the influenzaassociated and cytokine storm encephalopathy groups. Children with sequelae showed higher BDNF and IL-6 levels than those without sequelae. In pediatric patients, changes in serum and CSF BDNF and IL-6 levels may serve as a prognostic index of CNS infections, particularly for the diagnosis of encephalopathy and differentiation of encephalopathy types\" Link: \"We investigated the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and interleukin (IL)-6 levels in pediatric patients with central nervous system (CNS) infections, particularly viral infection-induced encephalopathy.

AND AUTISM is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction, deficits in verbal and non-verbal communication, and repetitive behavior and restricted interests. Emerging evidence suggests that aberrant neuroimmune responses may contribute to phenotypic deficits and could be appropriate targets for pharmacologic intervention. Interleukin (IL)-6, one of the most important neuroimmune factors, has been shown to be involved in physiological brain development and in several neurological disorders. For instance, findings from postmortem and animal studies suggest that brain IL-6 is an important mediator of autism-like behaviors. In this review, a possible pathological mechanism behind autism is proposed, which suggests that IL-6 elevation in the brain, caused by the activated glia and/or maternal immune activation, could be an important inflammatory cytokine response involved in the mediation of autism-like behaviors through impairments of neuroanatomical structures and neuronal plasticity. Further studies to investigate whether IL-6 could be used for therapeutic interventions in autism would be of great significance\" Link: \"Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction, deficits in verbal and non-verbal communication, and repetitive behavior and restricted interests.

Breaking Patterns of Environmentally Influenced Disease for Health Risk Reduction: Immune Perspectives Abstract: \"Background: Diseases rarely, if ever, occur in isolation. Instead, most represent part of a more complex web or \"pattern\" of conditions that are connected via underlying biological mechanisms and processes, emerge across a lifetime, and have been identified with the aid of large medical databases. Objective: We have described how an understanding of patterns of disease may be used to develop new strategies for reducing the prevalence and risk of major immune-based illnesses and diseases influenced by environmental stimuli. Findings: Examples of recently defined patterns of diseases that begin in childhood include not only metabolic syndrome, with its characteristics of inflammatory dysregulation, but also allergic, autoimmune, recurrent infection, and other inflammatory patterns of disease. The recent identification of major immune-based disease patterns beginning in childhood suggests that the immune system may play an even more important role in determining health status and health care needs across a lifetime than was previously understood. Conclusions: Focusing on patterns of disease, as opposed to individual conditions, offers two important venues for environmental health risk reduction. First, prevention of developmental immunotoxicity and pediatric immune dysfunction can be used to act against multiple diseases. Second, pattern-based treatment of entryway diseases can be tailored with the aim of disrupting the entire disease pattern and reducing the risk of later-life illnesses connected to underlying immune dysfunction. Disease-pattern-based evaluation, prevention, and treatment will require a change from the current approach for both immune safety testing and pediatric disease management.\" Link: \"Background: Diseases rarely, if ever, occur in isolation.

C1q, the recognition subcomponent of the classical pathway of complement, drives microglial activation Abstract: \"Microglia, central nervous system (CNS) resident phagocytic cells, persistently police the integrity of CNS tissue and respond to any kind of damage and pathophysiological changes. These cells sense and rapidly respond to danger and inflammatory signals by changing their cell morphology, by release of cytokines, chemokines or nitric oxide, and by changing their MHC expression profile. We have shown previously, that microglial biosynthesis of the complement subcomponent C1q may serve as a reliable marker of microglial activation ranging from undetectable levels of C1q biosynthesis in resting microglia to abundant C1q expression in activated, non-ramified microglia. In this study, we demonstrate that cultured microglial cells respond to extrinsic C1q with a marked intracellular Ca2+ increase. A shift towards proinflammatory microglial activation is indicated by the release of IL6, TNF-, and nitric oxide and the oxidative burst in rat primary microglial cells, an activation and differentiation process similar to pro-inflammatory response of microglia to exposure to LPS. Our findings indicate (i) that extrinsic plasma C1q is involved in the initiation of microglial activation in the course of CNS diseases with blood brain barrier impairment and (ii) C1q synthesized and released by activated microglia is likely to contribute in an autocrine/paracrine way to maintain and balance microglial activation in the diseased CNS tissue.\" Link: \"Microglia, central nervous system (CNS) resident phagocytic cells, persistently police the integrity of CNS tissue and respond to any kind of damage and pathophysiological changes.

Cerebral Microglia Recruit Monocytes into the Brain in Response to Tumor Necrosis Factor Signaling during Peripheral Organ Inflammation Abstract: \"In inflammatory diseases occurring outside the CNS, communication between the periphery and the brain via humoral and/or neural routes results in central neural changes and associated behavioral alterations. We have recently identified another immune-to-CNS communication pathway in the setting of organ-centered peripheral inflammation: namely, the entrance of immune cells into the brain. In our current study, using a mouse model of inflammatory liver injury, we have confirmed the significant infiltration of activated monocytes intothe brain in mice with hepatic inflammation and have definedthe mechanismthat mediatesthistrafficking of monocytes. Specifically, we show that in the presence of hepatic inflammation, mice demonstrate elevated cerebral monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 levels, as well as increased numbers of circulating CCR2-expressing monocytes. Cerebral recruitment of monocytes was abolished in inflamed mice that lacked MCP-1/CCL2 or CCR2. Furthermore, in mice with hepatic inflammation, microglia were activated and produced MCP-1/CCL2 before cerebral monocyte infiltration. Moreover, peripheral tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling was required to stimulate microglia to produce MCP-1/CCL2. TNF signaling via TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) is required for these observed effects since in TNFR1 deficient mice with hepatic inflammation, microglial expression of MCP-1/CCL2 and cerebral monocyte recruitment were both markedly inhibited, whereasthere was no inhibition in TNFR2 deficient mice. Our results identifythe existence of a novel immune-to-CNS communication pathway occurring in the setting of peripheral organ-centered inflammation which may have specific implications for the development of alterations in cerebral neurotransmission commonly encountered in numerous inflammatory diseases occurring outside the CNS.\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19228962 \"In inflammatory diseases occurring outside the CNS, communication between the periphery and the brain via humoral and/or neural routes results in central neural changes and associated behavioral alterations.

Cytokine dysregulation in autism spectrum disorders (ASD): Possible role of the environment Abstract: \"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental diseases that affect an alarming number of individuals. The etiological basis of ASD is unclear, and evidence suggests it involves both genetic and environmental factors. There are many reports of cytokine imbalances in ASD. These imbalances could have a pathogenic role, or they may be markers of underlying genetic and environmental influences. Cytokines act primarily as mediators of immunological activity but they also have significant interactions with the nervous system. They participate in normal neural development and function, and inappropriate activity can have a variety of neurological implications. It is therefore possible that cytokine dysregulation contributes directly to neural dysfunction in ASD. Further, cytokine profiles change dramatically in the face of infection, disease, and toxic exposures. Imbalances in cytokines may represent an immune response to environmental contributors to ASD. The following review is presented in two main parts. First, we discuss select cytokines implicated in ASD, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-4, IFN-, and TGF-, and focus on their role in the nervous system. Second, we explore several neurotoxic environmental factors that may be involved in the disorders, and focus on their immunological impacts.

Cytokine-dependent bidirectional connection between impaired social behavior and susceptibility to seizures associated with maternal immune activation in mice Abstract: \"Maternal immune activation (MIA) results in the development of autism in the offspring via hyperactivation of IL-6 signaling. Furthermore, experimental studies showed that the MIA-associated activation of interleukin-1 (IL-1) concurrently with IL-6 increases the rate and the severity of hippocampal kindling in mice, thus, offering an explanation for autism-epilepsy comorbidity. We examined whether epileptic phenotype triggered by prenatal exposure to IL-6 and IL-1 combination is restricted to kindling or whether it is reproducible in another model of epilepsy, whereby spontaneous seizures develop following kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus. We also examined whether in mice prenatally exposed to IL-6 and IL-6 + IL-1, the presence of spontaneous seizures would exacerbate autism-like features. Between days 12 and 16 of pregnancy, C57BL/6J mice received daily injections of IL-6, IL-1, or IL-6 + IL-1 combination. At postnatal day 40, male offspring were examined for the presence of social behavioral deficit, and status epilepticus was induced by intrahippocampal KA injection. After 6 weeks of monitoring for spontaneous seizures, sociability was tested again. Both IL-6 and IL-6 + IL-1 offspring presented with social behavioral deficit. Prenatal exposure to IL-6 alleviated, while such exposure to IL- 6 + IL-1 exacerbated, the severity of KA-induced epilepsy. Increased severity of epilepsy in the IL-6 + IL-1 mice correlated with the improvement of autism-like behavior.

Developmental Immunotoxicity, Perinatal on Human Studies Abstract: \"Developmental immunotoxicity (DIT) is a term given to encompass the environmentally induced disruption of normal immune development resulting in adverse outcomes. A myriad of chemical, physical, and psychological factors can all contribute to DIT. As a core component of the developmental origins of adult disease, DIT is interlinked with three important concepts surrounding health risks across a lifetime: (1) the Barker Hypothesis, which connects prenatal development to later-life diseases, (2) the hygiene hypothesis, which connects newborns and infants to risk of later-life diseases and, (3) fetal programming and epigenetic alterations, which may exert effects both in later life and across future generations. This review of DIT considers: (1) the history and context of DIT research, (2) the fundamental features of DIT, (3) the emerging role of DIT in risk of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and (4) the range of risk factors that have been investigated through human research. The emphasis on the human DIT-related literature is significant since most prior reviews of DIT have largely focused on animal research and considerations of specific categories of risk factors (e.g., heavy metals). Risk factors considered in this review include air pollution, aluminum, antibiotics, arsenic, bisphenol A, ethanol, lead (Pb), maternal smoking and environmental tobacco smoke, paracetamol (DIT) is a term given to encompass the environmentally induced disruption of normal immune development resulting in adverse outcomes. A myriad of chemical, physical, and psychological factors can all contribute to DIT. As a core component of the developmental origins of adult disease, DIT is interlinked with three important concepts surrounding health risks across a lifetime: (1) the Barker Hypothesis, which connects prenatal development to later-life diseases, (2) the hygiene hypothesis, which connects newborns and infants to risk of later-life diseases and, (3) fetal programming and epigenetic alterations, which may exert effects both in later life and across future generations.

The MIA rodent model provides a valuable tool to directly test the postnatal consequences of exposure to an early inflammatory insult; and examine novel preventative strategies. Here we tested the hypotheses that behavioural differences in the MIA mouse model are accompanied by in vivo and ex vivo alterations in brain biochemistry; and that these can be prevented by a post-weaning diet enriched with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). The viral analogue PolyI:C (POL) or saline (SAL) was administered to pregnant mice on gestation day 9. Half the resulting male offspring (POL = 21; SAL = 17) were weaned onto a conventional lab diet (n-6 PUFA); half were weaned onto n-3 PUFA-enriched diet. In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures were acquired prior to glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) and tyrosine hydroxylase levels were measured ex vivo. The main findings were: (i) Adult MIA-exposed mice fed a standard diet had greater N-acetylaspartate/creatine (Cr) and lower myo-inositol/Cr levels in the cingulate cortex in vivo. (ii) The extent of these metabolite differences was correlated with impairment in prepulse inhibition. (iii) MIA-exposed mice on the control diet also had higher levels of anxiety and altered levels of GAD67 ex vivo. (iv) An n-3 PUFA diet prevented all the in vivo and ex vivo effects of MIA observed. Thus, n-3 PUFA dietary enrichment from early life may offer a relatively safe and non-toxic approach to limit the otherwise persistent behavioural and biochemical consequences of prenatal exposure to inflammation.

Of Mice and Not Men: Differences between Mouse and Human Immunology Abstract: \"Mice are the experimental tool of choice for the majority of immunologists and the study of their immune responses has yielded tremendous insight into the workings of the human immune system. However, as 65 million years of evolution might suggest, there are significant differences. Here we outline known discrepancies in both innate and adaptive immunity, including: balance of leukocyte subsets, defensins, Toll families Ly49 FcR, Ig subsets, the B cell (BLNK, Btk, and 5) and T cell (ZAP70 and common -chain) signaling pathway components, Thy-1, T cells, cytokines and cytokine receptors, Th1/Th2 differentiation, costimulatory molecule expression and function, Ag-presenting function of endothelial cells, and chemokine and chemokine receptor expression.

Different human vaccine adjuvants promote immunological signatures tailored to different pathogens Abstract: \"The majority of vaccine candidates in clinical development are highly purified proteins and peptides relying on adjuvants to enhance and/or direct immune responses.

A vast number of adjuvants have been tested pre-clinically using different experimental conditions, rendering it impossible to directly compare their activity. We performed a head-to-head comparison of five different adjuvants Alum, MF59\u00ae, GLA-SE, IC31\u00ae and CAF01 in mice and combined these with antigens from M. tuberculosis, influenza, and chlamydia to test immune-profiles and efficacy in infection models using standardized protocols. Regardless of antigen, each adjuvant had a unique immunological signature suggesting that the adjuvants have potential for different disease targets.

Divergent cerebrospinal fluid cytokine network induced by non-viral and different viral infections on the central nervous system Abstract: \"Background: Meningoencephalitis is one of the most common disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) worldwide. Viral meningoencephalitis differs from bacterial meningitis in several aspects. In some developing countries, bacterial meningitis has appropriate clinical management and chemotherapy is available. Virus-associated and virus not detected meningoencephalitis are treatable, however, they may cause death in a few cases. The knowledge of how mediators of inflammation can induce disease would contribute for the design of affordable therapeutic strategies, as well as to the diagnosis of virus not detected and viral meningoencephalitis. Cytokine-induced inflammation to CNS requires several factors that are not fully understood yet. Methods: Considering this, several cytokines were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with undiagnosed and viral meningoencephalitis, and these were correlated with cellularity in the CSF. Results: The results demonstrate that an altered biochemical profile alongside increased cellularity in the cerebrospinal fluid is a feature of patients with meningoencephalitis that are not associated with the detection of virus in the CNS (P < 0.05). Moreover, HIV-positive patients (n = 10) that evolve with meningoencephalitis display a distinct biochemical/ cytological profile (P < 0.05) in the cerebrospinal fluid. Meningoencephalitis brings about a prominent intrathecal cytokine storm regardless of the detection of virus as presumable etiological agent. In the case of Enterovirus 13), meningoencephalitis elicits robust intrathecal pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern and elevated cellularity when compared to herpesvirus (n = 15) and Arbovirus (n = 5) viral infections (P < 0.05).

Effects of Inflammation on Hippocampus and Substantia Nigra Responses to Novelty in Healthy Human Participants Abstract: \"Humans are naturally inquisitive. This tendency is adaptive, aiding identification of potentially valuable novel outcomes. The dopaminergic substantia nigra (SN) is implicated in the drive to explore novel stimuli and situations. However, infection and inflammation inhibit the motivation to seek out novelty. This likely serves to limit exposure to uncertain, potentially detrimental outcomes when metabolic resources are limited. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms through which inflammation constrains novelty seeking are poorly understood. We therefore scanned 16 healthy participants (6 male, mean 27.2\u00b17.3 years), using fMRI, once following experimental inflammation (intramuscular (i.m.) typhoid vaccination) and once after placebo (i.m. saline), with the aim of characterizing effects of inflammation on neural processing of novel and familiar place, and face stimuli. We specifically tested the effects of inflammation on the hypothesized roles of SN and hippocampus in novelty processing. Typhoid vaccination evoked a nearly threefold increase in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokine (interleukin-6) levels 3 h after injection, indicating induction of mild systemic inflammation. Enhanced hippocampal responses to novel (compared with familiar) stimuli were observed following both vaccine and placebo, consistent with intact central novelty detection. However, the normal bilateral reactivity of SN to stimulus novelty was significantly attenuated following inflammation. Correspondingly, inflammation also markedly impaired novelty-related functional coupling between the SN and hippocampus. These data extend previous findings of SN sensitivity to mild inflammation associated with changes in psychomotor responding, and suggest that inflammation-induced blunting of SN responses to hippocampal novelty signals may represent a plausible mechanism through which inflammation impairs motivational responses to novelty\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25154706 \"Humans are naturally inquisitive.

Effects of supplementation with tocotrienol-rich fraction on immune response to tetanus toxoid immunization in normal healthy volunteers Abstract: \"Background/Objectives: Vitamin E is an essential fat-soluble vitamin that has been shown to induce favorable effects on animal and human immune systems. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) supplementation on immune response following tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccine challenge in healthy female volunteers. Subjects/Methods: In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, participants were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (control group) or 400 mg of TRF (study group) supplementation daily. Over the 2-month period of the study, volunteers were asked to attend three clinical sessions (that is, on days 0, 28 and 56) and blood samples were obtained from the volunteers during the follow-up. On day 28, all volunteers were also vaccinated with the TT vaccine (20 Lf) intramuscularly. Results: The results from the clinical trial showed that TRF supplementation significantly increased the total vitamin E level in the plasma of the TRF-supplemented volunteers compared with the placebo group, indicating overall compliance. Volunteers supplemented with TRF showed a significantly (Po0.05) enhanced production of interferon-g and interleukin (IL)-4 by the mitogen or TT-stimulated leukocytes compared with the control group.

Elucidating the Early Signal Transduction Pathways Fetal Brain Injury in Preterm Birth Abstract: \"Adverse neurologic outcome, including cerebral palsy, is a significant contributor to long-term morbidity in preterm neonates. However, the mechanisms leading to brain injury in the setting of a preterm birth are poorly understood. In the last decade, there has been a growing body of evidence correlating infection or inflammation with preterm birth. The presence of intrauterine inflammation significantly increases the risk for adverse neurologic outcome in the neonate. These studies were performed to elucidate the early signal transduction pathways activated in the fetal brain that may result in long-term neurologic injury. Using our mouse model of localized intrauterine inflammation, the activation of TH1/TH2 pathways in the placenta, fetus corpus, fetal liver, and fetal brain was investigated. Additional studies determined whether activation of TH1/TH2 pathways could promote cell death and alter glial development. Real-time PCR studies demonstrated that a robust TH1/TH2 response occurs rapidly in the fetal brain after exposure to intrauterine inflammation. The cytokine response in the fetus and placenta was not significantly correlated with the response in the fetal brain. Along with an immune response, cell death pathways were activated early in the fetal brain in response to intrauterine LPS.

Evidence of microglial activation in autism and its possible role in brain underconnectivity Abstract: \"Evidence indicates that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suffer from an ongoing neuroinflammatory process in different regions of the brain involving microglial activation. When microglia remain activated for an extended period, the production of mediators is sustained longer than usual and this increase in mediators contributes to loss of synaptic connections and neuronal cell death. Microglial activation can then result in a loss of connections or underconnectivity. Underconnectivity is reported in many studies in autism. One way to control neuroinflammation is to reduce or inhibit microglial activation. It is plausible that by reducing brain inflammation and microglial activation, the neurodestructive effects of chronic inflammation could be reduced and allow for improved developmental outcomes. Future studies that examine treatments that may reduce microglial activation and neuroinflammation, and ultimately help to mitigate symptoms in ASD, are warranted\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3523548/ \"Evidence indicates that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suffer from an ongoing neuroinflammatory process in different regions of the brain involving microglial activation.

Methods: Changes in abdominal temperature were recorded in unrestrained animals by use of intra-abdominally implanted radiotransmitters. Circulating concentrations of tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured by of specific bioassays. Results: The pyrogenic effect of double-stranded RNA at a dose of 500 lg kg)1 depended on the route of its administration. Intra-arterial (i.a.) or intraperitoneal injections of double-stranded RNA induced pronounced fevers and strong elevations of circulating TNF-a and IL-6. Intramuscular injections of the synthetic pyrogen caused rather moderate febrile and cytokine responses. Administration of synthetic RNA into artificial subcutaneously implanted Teflon chambers had no pyrogenic and cytokine-inducing effects. I.a. injections of double-stranded RNA, repeated five times at intervals of 3 days, resulted in fevers of similar shape and duration and similar cytokine response patterns. However, the strength of fever and cytokine formation was significantly reduced, although not abolished, in response to the repeated injections compared with the first injection, indicating a partial development of tolerance. Conclusions: The modulation of the strength of RNA-induced fever, dependent on the route of administration, or the state of partial tolerance to this pyrogen, may thus be related to the formation of pyrogenic cytokines.

Gender-Dependent Effects of Maternal Immune Activation on the Behavior of Mouse Offspring Abstract: \"Autism spectrum disorders are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by two core symptoms; impaired social interactions and communication, and ritualistic or repetitive behaviors. Both epidemiological and biochemical evidence suggests that a subpopulation of autistics may be linked to immune perturbations that occurred during fetal development. These findings have given rise to an animal model, called the ''maternal immune activation'' model, whereby the offspring from female rodents who were subjected to an immune stimulus during early or mid-pregnancy are studied. Here, C57BL/6 mouse dams were treated mid-gestation with saline, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic a bacterial infection, or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly IC) to mimic a viral infection. Autism-associated behaviors were examined in the adult offspring of the treated dams. Behavioral tests were conducted to assess motor activity, exploration in a novel environment, sociability, and repetitive behaviors, and data analyses were carried independently on male and female mice. We observed a main treatment effect whereby male offspring from Poly IC-treated dams showed reduced motor activity. In the marble burying test of repetitive behavior, male offspring but not female offspring from both LPS and Poly IC-treated mothers showed increased marble burying. Our findings indicate that offspring from mothers subjected to immune stimulation during gestation show a gender-specific increase in stereotyped repetitive behavior.\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25111339 \"Autism spectrum disorders are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by two core symptoms; impaired social interactions and communication, and ritualistic or repetitive behaviors.

Gestational Exposure to a Viral Mimetic Poly(I:C) Results in Long-Lasting Changes in Mitochondrial Function by Leucocytes in the Adult Offspring Abstract: \"Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a potential risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ). In rodents, MIA results in changes in cytokine profiles and abnormal behaviors in the offspring that model these neuropsychiatric conditions. Given the central role that mitochondria have in immunity and other metabolic pathways, we hypothesized that MIA will result in a fetal imprinting that leads to postnatal deficits in the bioenergetics of immune cells. To this end, splenocytes from adult offspring exposed gestationally to the viral mimic poly(I:C) were evaluated for mitochondrial outcomes. A significant decrease in mitochondrial ATP production was observed in poly(I:C)-treated mice (45% of controls) mainly attributed to a lower complex I activity. No differences were observed between the two groups in the coupling of electron transport to ATP synthesis, or the oxygen uptake under uncoupling conditions. Concanavalin A- (ConA-) stimulated splenocytes from poly(I:C) animals showed no statistically significant changes in cytokine levels compared to controls. The present study reports for the first time that MIA activation by poly(I:C) at early gestation, which can lead to behavioral impairments in the offspring similar to SZ and ASD, leads to long-lasting effects in the bioenergetics of splenocytes of adult offspring.\" Link: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mi/2013/609602/ \"Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a potential risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ).

Mercury induces inflammatory mediator release from human mast cells Abstract: \"Background: Mercury is known to be neurotoxic, but its effects on the immune system are less well known. Mast cells are involved in allergic reactions, but also in innate and acquired immunity, as well as in inflammation. Many patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have \"allergic\" symptoms; moreover, the prevalence of ASD in patients with mastocytosis, characterized by numerous hyperactive mast cells in most tissues, is 10-fold higher than the general population suggesting mast cell involvement. We, therefore, investigated the effect of mercuric chloride (HgCl2) on human mast cell activation. Methods: Human leukemic cultured LAD2 mast cells and normal human umbilical cord blood-derived cultured mast cells (hCBMCs) were stimulated by HgCl2 (0.1-10 M) for either 10 min for beta-hexosaminidase release or 24 hr for measuring vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and IL-6 release by ELISA. Results: HgCl2 induced a 2-fold increase in b-hexosaminidase release, and also significant VEGF release at 0.1 and 1 M (311 \u00b1 32 pg/106 cells and 443 \u00b1 143 pg/106 cells, respectively) from LAD2 mast cells compared to control cells (227 \u00b1 17 pg/106 cells, n = 5, p < 0.05). Addition of HgCl2 (0.1 M) to the proinflammatory neuropeptide substance P (SP, 0.1 M) had synergestic action in inducing VEGF from LAD2 mast cells. HgCl2 also stimulated significant VEGF release (360 \u00b1 100 pg/106 cells at 1 M, n = 5, p < 0.05) from hCBMCs compared to control cells (182 \u00b1 57 pg/106 cells), and IL-6 release (466 \u00b1 57 pg/106 cells at 0.1 M) compared to untreated cells (13 \u00b1 25 pg/106 cells, n = 5, p < 0.05).

IL-6 is increased in the cerebellum of autistic brain and alters neural cell adhesion, migration and synaptic formation Abstract: \"Background: Although the cellular mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of autism are not understood, a growing number of studies have suggested that localized inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) may contribute to the development of autism. Recent evidence shows that IL-6 has a crucial role in the development and plasticity of CNS. Methods: Immunohistochemistry studies were employed to detect the IL-6 expression in the cerebellum of study subjects. In vitro adenoviral gene delivery approach was used to over-express IL-6 in cultured cerebellar granule DiI labeling, staining and immunofluorescence were used to cell adhesion and migration, dendritic spine morphology, cell apoptosis and synaptic protein expression respectively. Results: In this study, we found that IL-6 was significantly increased in the cerebellum of autistic subjects. We investigated how IL-6 affects neural cell development and function by transfecting cultured mouse cerebellar granule cells with an IL-6 viral expression vector. We demonstrated that IL-6 over-expression in granule cells caused impairments in granule cell adhesion and migration but had little effect on the formation of dendritic spines or granule cell apoptosis. However, synapses, without affecting inhibitory synapses. Conclusions: Our results provide further evidence that aberrant IL-6 may be associated with autism. In addition, our results suggest that the elevated IL-6 in the autistic brain could alter neural cell adhesion, migration and also cause an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory circuits.

Selective induction of can be prevented by selenium Abstract: \"In this study the acute toxic effects of aluminum (Al) on mice have been investigated, including the interactions of Al and selenium (Se). Focus was put on the systemic effects of (co)exposure to Al and Se as a reflection of the redox status in the liver, kidney and brain. Short-term exposure (16 h) to Al resulted in an increase in the systemic inflammation parameters IL-6 and PAI-1, whereas serum levels of TNF- remained unaffected. The different response pattern of IL- 6 and TNF- probably indicates an increased intracellular oxidative stress and altered redox status in the liver, because the selective increase in IL-6 serves as a protective intrahepatocellular process driven by oxidative stress. The intracellular glutathione concentration GSHtot decreased significantly upon Al exposure. Both the increase in IL-6 and decrease in glutathione status could be prevented by co-exposure to Se, but not the increase in PAI-1. The redox status of the kidney and brain was not markedly affected.

Chronic Interleukin-6 and Calcium Signaling in Developing in Culture Abstract: \"Chronic interleukin-6 exposure properties and calcium signaling cytokine interleukin-6 expressed at elevated levels within the CNS in many neurological disorders and may contribute to the histopathological, pathophysiological, and cognitive deficits associated with such disorders. However, the effects of chronic IL-6 exposure on neuronal function in the CNS are largely unknown. Therefore using intracellular recording and calcium imaging techniques, we investigated the effects of chronic IL-6 exposure on the physiological properties of cerebellar Purkinje neurons in primary culture. Two weeks of exposure to 1,000 units/ml (U/ml) IL-6 resulted in altered electrophysiological properties of Purkinje neurons, including a significant reduction in action potential generation, an increase in input resistance, and an enhanced electrical response to the ionotropic glutamate receptor agonist, -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) compared with untreated neurons. Lower concentrations of IL-6 (100 and 500 U/ml) had no effects on these electrophysiological parameters. However, neurons exposed to 500 U/ml chronic IL-6 resulted in significantly elevated resting levels of intracellular calcium as well as an increase in the intracellular calcium signal of Purkinje neurons in response to AMPA, effects not observed in neurons exposed to 1,000 U/ml chronic IL-6. Morphometric analysis revealed a lack of gross structural changes following chronic IL-6 treatment, such as in the number, size, and extent of dendritic arborization of Purkinje neurons in culture. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that cultured Purkinje neurons express both the IL-6 receptor and its intracellular signaling subunit, gp130, indicating that IL-6 may act directly on Purkinje neurons to alter their physiological properties. The present data show that chronic exposure to elevated levels of IL-6, such as occurs in various neurological diseases, produces alterations in several important physiological properties of Purkinje neurons and that these changes occur in the absence of neuronal toxicity, damage, or death. The results support the hypothesis that chronic IL-6 exposure can disrupt normal CNS function and thereby contribute to the pathophysiology associated with neurological diseases.\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12091569 \"Chronic interleukin-6 cytokine interleukin-6 expressed at elevated levels within the CNS in many neurological disorders and may contribute to the histopathological, pathophysiological, and cognitive deficits associated with such disorders.

Maternal Immune Activation and Autism Spectrum Disorder: Interleukin-6 Signaling as a Key Mechanistic Pathway Abstract: \"An emerging area of research in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the role of prenatal exposure to inflammatory mediators during critical developmental periods. Epidemiological data has highlighted this relationship showing significant correlations between prenatal exposure to pathogens, including influenza, and the occurrence of ASD. Although there has not been a definitive molecular mechanism established, researchers have begun to investigate this relationship as animal models of maternal infection have supported epidemiological findings. Several groups utilizing these animal models have found that activation of the maternal immune system, termed maternal immune activation (MIA), and more specifically the exposure of the developing fetus to maternal cytokines precipitate the neurological, immunological and behavioral abnormalities observed in the offspring of these animals. These abnormalities have correlated with clinical findings of immune dysregulation, neurological and behavioral abnormalities in some autistic individuals. Additionally, researchers have observed genetic variations in these models in genes which regulate neurological and immunological development, similar to what is observed clin ically in ASD. Altogether, the role of MIA and cytokine dysregulation, as a key mediator in the neuropathological, behavioral and possibly genetic irregularities observed clinically in autism are important factors that warrant further investigation.\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20924155 \"An emerging area of research in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the role of prenatal exposure to inflammatory mediators during critical developmental periods.

Interleukin-6, Abstract: \"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine originally identified almost 30 years ago as a B-cell differentiation factor, capable of inducing the maturation of B cells into antibody-producing cells. As with many other cytokines, it was soon realized that IL-6 was not a factor only involved in the immune response, but with many critical roles in major physiological systems including the nervous system. IL-6 is now known to participate in neurogenesis (influencing both neurons and glial cells), and in the response of mature neurons and glial cells in normal conditions and following a wide arrange of injury models.

As with many other cytokines, it was soon realized that IL-6 was not a factor only involved in the immune response, but with many critical roles in major physiological systems including the nervous system. IL-6 is now known to participate in neurogenesis (influencing both neurons and glial cells), and in the response of mature neurons and glial cells in normal conditions and following a wide arrange of injury models.

Cytokine and chemokine responses to Japanese live attenuated vaccine in a human population Abstract: \"Objectives: The SA14-14-2 Japanese encephalitis (JE) live attenuated vaccine is licensed for use only in China, and has provided excellent efficacy in reducing the incidence of JE. The humoral immune response related to the JE vaccination has been well characterized, however cellular immune responses are less well known. Methods: Thirty-four healthy males who had recently received inoculation with the SA14-14-2 live attenuated vaccine were recruited. Serum samples from these subjects were analyzed for cytokine and chemokine levels using the FlowCytomix method. Results: Eighteen of 34 subjects were positive for JE virus-specific IgG antibodies. Levels of interleukin (IL)-8, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1a, and MIP-1b were significantly higher in the vaccinees than in a control group (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p = 0.021, and p < 0.0001, respectively). IL-6 was detectable in 64.7% of vaccinees, but was not detectable in any of and interferon (IFN)-g were detected in very few subjects or were undetectable in both groups.

Immune mediated conditions in autism spectrum disorders Abstract: \"We conducted a case-control study among members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) born between 1980 and 2003 to determine the prevalence of immune-mediated conditions in individuals with autism, investigate whether these conditions occur more often than expected, and explore the timing of onset relative to autism diagnosis.

Our literature review found very few studies supporting this theory, with the overwhelming majority showing no causal association between the Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine and autism. The vaccine preservative thimerosal has alternatively been hypothesized to have a possible causal role in autism. Again, no convincing evidence was found to support this claim, nor for the use of chelation therapy in autism.

Immunological stress at the between neurodevelopment and adult psychopathology Abstract: \"Maternal infection during pregnancy is associated with a higher incidence of mental disorders, including schizophrenia, in the oVspring in later life. Our recent attempt to study this link between prenatal immunological challenge and subsequent psychopathology has led to the establishment of a mouse model demonstrating the emergence of multiple psychotic-like phenotypes following immunological challenge on gestation day (GD) 9. However, little is known about the impact of similar in utero challenge at diVerent times of pregnancy. Here, we compare the eYcacy of identical maternal immune stimulation induced by the exposure to polyriboinosinic- polyribocytidilic acid (Poly(I:C)) at a dose of 5 mg/kg (i.v.) on distinct days of gestation (GD 6, 9, 13 or 17). The oVspring derived were then compared to those collected from vehicle- and non-treated dams in two paradigms of selective associative learning: latent inhibition (LI) and the US-pre-exposure eVect (USPEE). LI deWciency was observed in animals born to dams treated with Poly(I:C) on GD 6, 9 or 13, but not in those on GD17. In contrast, a loss of the USPEE was equivalently seen in all Poly(I:C) treatment groups, regardless of treatment times. Evaluation of the acute cytokine response in a separate cohort of pregnant dams receiving Poly(I:C) challenge on either GD9 or GD17 revealed that the ratio of interleukin-10/tumor necrosis factor- was elevated in the GD17 relative to the GD9 group. The present report thus provides evidence that the acute cytokine reaction as well as the long-term pattern of behavioural sequelae of maternal immune challenge can be aVected by its precise timing during pregnancy.

Impaired synaptic development in a maternal immune activation mouse model of neurodevelopmental disorders Abstract: \"Both genetic and environmental factors are thought to contribute to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders with maternal immune activation (MIA) being a risk factor for both autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. Although MIA mouse offspring exhibit behavioral impairments, the synaptic alterations in vivo that mediate these behaviors are not known. Here we employed in vivo multiphoton imaging to determine that in the cortex of young MIA offspring there is a reduction in number and turnover rates of dendritic spines, sites of majority of excitatory synaptic inputs. Significantly, spine impairments persisted into adulthood and correlated with increased repetitive behavior, an ASD relevant behavioral phenotype. Structural analysis of synaptic inputs revealed a reorganization of presynaptic inputs with a larger proportion of spines being contacted by both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals. These structural impairments were accompanied by altered excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. Finally, we report that a postnatal treatment of MIA offspring with the anti-inflammatory drug ibudilast, prevented both synaptic and behavioral impairments. Our results suggest that a possible altered inflammatory state associated with maternal immune activation results in impaired synaptic development that persists into adulthood but which can be prevented with early anti-inflammatory treatment.\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26218293 \"Both genetic and environmental factors are thought to contribute to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders with maternal immune activation (MIA) being a risk factor for both autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia.

Inflammation early in life is a vulnerability factor for emotional behavior at adolescence and for lipopolysaccharide-induced spatial memory and neurogenesis alteration at adulthood Abstract: \"Background: The postnatal period is a critical time window during which inflammatory events have significant and enduring effects on the brain, and as a consequence, induce alterations of emotional behavior and/or cognition later in life. However, the long-term effect of neonatal inflammation on behavior during adolescence, a sensitive period for the development of neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders, has been little studied. In this study, we examined whether an early-life inflammatory challenge could alter emotional behaviors and spatial memory at adolescence and adulthood and whether stress axis activity, inflammatory response and neurogenesis were affected. Methods: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 g/kg) was administered to mice on postnatal day (PND) 14 and cytokine expression was measured in the plasma and in brain structures 3 hours later. Anxiety-like and depressive-like behavior (measured in the novelty-suppressed feeding test and the forced swim test, respectively) and spatial memory (Y-maze test) were measured at adolescence (PND30) and adulthood (PND90). Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity (plasma glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) was measured at adulthood. In addition, the impact of a novel adult LPS challenge (100 /kg) was measured on spatial memory (Y-maze test), neurogenesis (doublecortin-positive cell numbers in the hippocampus) and plasma cytokine expression. Results: First, we show in PND14 pups that a peripheral administration of LPS induced the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the plasma and brain structures that were studied 3 hours after administration. Anxiety-like behavior was altered in adolescent, but not in adult, mice, whereas depressive-like behavior was spared at adolescence and increased at adulthood. This was accompanied by a decreased phosphorylation of the glucocorticoid receptor in the prefrontal cortex, with no effect on corticosterone levels. Second, neonatal LPS treatment had no effect on spatial memory in adolescence and adulthood. However, a second challenge of LPS in adulthood impaired spatial memory performance and neurogenesis and increased circulating levels of CCL2. Conclusions: Our study shows for the first time, in mice, that a peripheral LPS treatment at PND14 differentially alters emotional behaviors, but not spatial memory, at adolescence and adulthood.

Interleukin-6, C-Reactive Protein, and Abnormal Cardiorespiratory Responses to Immunization in Premature Infants Abstract: \"Objective. We report our experience with routine immunization of 89 premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit because 1) a substantial number of them developed abnormal clinical signs, and 2) all but one of those who received diphtheria, tetanus, and whole-cell pertussis (DTwP) vaccine responded with elevations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations that are otherwise characteristic of bacterial disease. Methodology. We hypothesized that the elevated IL-6 and CRP levels were solely a response to immunization and that treatment with antibiotics was not necessary. We performed this study in two consecutive parts. In part 1, we prospectively evaluated 79 consecutive premature infants who were immunized with DTwP, Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, and inactivated polio vaccine, (Hib, HBV, and IPV). IL-6 and CRP were determined before immunization and every 12 hours on three occasions after immunization.

CRP and IL-6 values rose to abnormal levels after immunization in all but one infant; that infant was later shown to have a T-cell abnormality. In part 2, 3 infants had abnormal cardiorespiratory signs after simultaneous immunization with Hib, HBV, and IPV, but not after DTaP. IL-6 and CRP levels remained normal in all 10 infants. Conclusions. Part 1 demonstrates clearly the temporal relationship between IL-6 and CRP increments after DTwP, Hib, HBV, and IPV vaccines. In part 2 (DTaP was substituted for DTwP), there were no elevations of IL-6 or CRP, thus indicating that whole-cell pertussis component of DTwP was responsible for IL-6 and CRP elevations. Abnormal cardiorespiratory signs occurred frequently after immunizations in part 1, but they were unrelated to the magnitude of IL-6 and CRP elevations.

Intrapartum Temperature Elevation, Epidural Use, and Adverse Outcome in Term Infants Abstract: \"OBJECTIVES: To examine the association of intrapartum temperature elevation with adverse neonatal outcome among low-risk women receiving epidural analgesia and evaluate the association of epidural with adverse neonatal outcome without temperature elevation. METHODS: We studied all low-risk nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies $37 weeks delivering at our hospital during 2000, excluding pregnancies where infants had documented sepsis, meningitis, or a major congenital anomaly. Neonatal outcomes were compared between women receiving (n = 1538) and not receiving epidural analgesia (n = 363) in the absence of intrapartum temperature elevation (#99.5\u00b0F) and according to the level of intrapartum temperature elevation within the group receiving epidural (n = 2784). Logistic regression was used to evaluate neonatal outcome while controlling for confounders. RESULTS: Maternal temperature .100.4\u00b0F developed during labor in 19.2% (535/2784) of women receiving epidural compared with 2.4% (10/425) not receiving epidural. In the absence of intrapartum temperature elevation (#99.5\u00b0F), no significant differences were observed in adverse neonatal outcomes between women receiving and not receiving epidural. Among women receiving epidural, a significant linear trend was observed between maximum maternal temperature and all neonatal outcomes examined including hypotonia, assisted ventilation, 1- and 5-min Apgar scores ,7, and early-onset seizures. In regression analyses, infants born to women with fever .101\u00b0F had a two- to sixfold increased risk of all adverse outcomes examined.

RESULTS: Maternal temperature .100.4\u00b0F developed during labor in 19.2% (535/2784) of women receiving epidural compared with 2.4% (10/425) not receiving epidural. In the absence of intrapartum temperature elevation (#99.5\u00b0F), no significant differences were observed in adverse neonatal outcomes between women receiving and not receiving epidural. Among women receiving epidural, a significant linear trend was observed between maximum maternal temperature and all neonatal outcomes examined including hypotonia, assisted ventilation, 1- and 5-min Apgar scores ,7, and early-onset seizures. In regression analyses, infants born to women with fever .101\u00b0F had a two- to sixfold increased risk of all adverse outcomes examined. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of infants experiencing adverse outcomes increased with the degree of epidural-related maternal temperature elevation. Epidural use without temperature elevation was not associated with any\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22291120 75. Intrauterine inflammation, insufficient to induce parturition, still evokes fetal and neonatal brain injury Abstract: \"Abnormal development of the fetal brain in utero is now thought to contribute to the etiology of many functional and behavioral disorders that manifest throughout life. While differences in genetic makeup contribute to this, an 'adverse' intrauterine environment is a strong modulator of abnormal development. Maternal bacterial and viral infections during pregnancy represent a significant risk factor in several neuropsychiatric disorders with a presumed neurodevelopmental origin, including schizophrenia, autism, and cognitive delay. (Abecasis et al 2002; Brown et al 2004; Brown et al 2009; Ellman et al 2009; Fatemi et al 2002; Rantakallio et al 1997) However, specific infectious agents in this pathogenesis have not been demonstrated. It appears that prenatal inflammation is the greatest determinant of subsequent adverse outcomes for the offspring. While systemic infections during pregnancy are of concern, perhaps of greater concern, is the risk of in utero exposure to localized inflammation. A fetus is exposed to intrauterine inflammation in a woman with preterm labor and/or preterm birth or at any point in gestation when there evidence of chorioamnionitis (infection/inflammation of the fetal membranes).

In-vivo rodent models for the experimental investigation of prenatal immune activation effects in neurodevelopmental brain disorders Abstract: \"Based on the epidemiological association between maternal infection during pregnancy and enhanced risk of neurodevelopmental brain disorders in the offspring, a number of in-vivo models have been established in rats and mice in order to study this link on an experimental basis.

We highlight that these models can successfully examine the influence of the precise timing of maternal immune activation, the role of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and the contribution of gene-environment interactions in the association between prenatal immune challenge and postnatal brain dysfunctions.

LPS Exposure Increases Maternal Corticosterone Levels, Causes Placental Injury and Increases IL-1 Levels in Adult Rat Offspring: Relevance to Autism Abstract: \"Maternal immune activation can induce neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia. Previous investigations by our group have shown that prenatal treatment of rats on gestation day 9.5 with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 g/kg, intraperitoneally), which mimics infections by gram-negative bacteria, induced autism-like behavior in male rats, including impaired communication and socialization and induced repetitive/restricted behavior. However, the behavior of female rats was unchanged. Little is known about how LPS-induced changes in the pregnant dam subsequently affect the developing fetus and the fetal immune system.

In the adult offspring, we evaluated the HPA axis and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels with or without a LPS challenge. LPS exposure increased maternal serum corticosterone levels, injured placental tissue and led to higher post-implantation loss, resulting in fewer live fetuses. The HPA axis was not affected in adult offspring. However, prenatal LPS exposure increased IL-1 serum levels, revealing that prenatal LPS exposure modified the immune response to a LPS challenge in adulthood.

Magnesium sulfate reduces bacterial \"Objectives: (MgSO4) administration exerts anti-inflammatory and fetal neuroprotective effects. Based on the link between placental inflammation and fetal immune responses, we examined the effect of MgSO4 on LPS-induced inflammation at the maternalefetal interface. Study design: In vivo model: Pregnant rats (GD19) were injected intraperitoneally with saline, LPS, or MgSO4 plus LPS (n \u00bc 6 per group). Rats were euthanized; placentas were assayed for CCL2, IL6, and TNFa screened for gene expression. Ex vivo model: Human placental cultures were treated with vehicle, LPS, or MgSO4 plus LPS. Supernatants were assayed for CCL2, IL6, and TNFa. In addition, placental cultures were analyzed for inflammation-related gene expression and NFk B activation. Results: In vivo model: Maternal LPS administration resulted in pro-inflammatory mediator production within the placenta; maternal MgSO4 treatment CXCL1, expressed following were counter-regulated by MgSO4 treatment. Ex vivo model: LPS promoted human placental inflammation and MgSO4 significantly reduced inflammation induced by LPS. MgSO4 treatment of human placental explants significantly reversed the expression of numerous genes sensitive to LPS regulation and suppressed LPS-induced NFkB activation. Conclusions: MgSO4 administration inhibited placental inflammation during LPS-mediated maternal infection. Several placental inflammatory genes whose expression was regulated by LPS were reversed by MgSO4 treatment. Our data support the hypothesis that MgSO4 attenuates excessive inflammation at the maternalefetal interface, which when uncontrolled may compromise neonatal health, fetal neuroprotective effects.

Maternal Alters Fetal Brain Development through Interleukin-6 Abstract: \"Schizophrenia and autism are thought to result from the interaction between a susceptibility genotype and environmental risk factors. The offspring of women who experience infection while pregnant have an increased risk for these disorders. Maternal immune activation (MIA) in pregnant rodents produces offspring with abnormalities in behavior, histology, and gene expression that are reminiscent of schizophrenia and autism, making MIA a useful model of the disorders. However, the mechanism by which MIA causes long-term behavioral deficits in the offspring is unknown. Here we show that the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is critical for mediating the behavioral and transcriptional changes in the offspring. A single maternal injection of IL-6 on day 12.5 of mouse pregnancy causes prepulse inhibition (PPI) and latent inhibition (LI) deficits in the adult offspring. Moreover, coadministration of an anti-IL-6 antibody in the poly(I:C) model of MIA prevents the PPI, LI, and exploratory and social deficits caused by poly(I:C) and normalizes the associated changes in gene expression in the brains of adult offspring. Finally, MIA in IL-6 knock-out mice does not result in several of the behavioral changes seen in the offspring of wild-type mice after MIA. The identification of IL-6 as a key intermediary should aid in the molecular dissection of the pathways whereby MIA alters fetal brain development, which can shed new light on the pathophysiological mechanisms that predispose to schizophrenia and autism.\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17913903 \"Schizophrenia and autism are thought to result from the interaction between a susceptibility genotype and environmental risk factors.

Maternal Immune Activation Alters Nonspatial Information Processing in the Hippocampus of the Adult Offspring Abstract: \"The observation that maternal infection increases the risk for schizophrenia in the offspring suggests that the maternal immune system plays a key role in the etiology of schizophrenia. In a mouse model, maternal immune activation (MIA) by injection of poly(I:C) yields adult offspring that display abnormalities in a variety of behaviors relevant to schizophrenia. As abnormalities in the hippocampus are a consistent observation in schizophrenia patients, we examined synaptic properties in hippocampal slices prepared from the offspring of poly(I:C)- and saline-treated mothers. Compared to controls, CA1 pyramidal neurons from adult offspring of MIA mothers display reduced frequency and increased amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. In addition, the specific component of the temporoammonic pathway that mediates object-related information displays increased sensitivity to dopamine. To assess hippocampal network function in vivo, we used expression of the immediate early gene, c-Fos, as a surrogate measure of neuronal activity. Compared to controls, the offspring of poly(I:C)-treated mothers display a distinct c-Fos expression pattern in area CA1 following novel object, but not novel location, exposure. Thus, the offspring of MIA mothers may have an abnormality in modality-specific information processing. Indeed, the MIA offspring display enhanced discrimination in a novel object recognition, but not in an object location, task. Thus, analysis of object and spatial information processing at both synaptic and behavioral levels reveals a largely selective abnormality in object information processing in this mouse model.

Maternal immune activation and abnormal brain development across CNS disorders Abstract: \"Epidemiological studies have shown a clear association between maternal infection and schizophrenia or autism in the progeny. Animal models have revealed maternal immune activation (mIA) to be a profound risk factor for neurochemical and behavioural abnormalities in the offspring. Microglial priming has been proposed as a major consequence of mIA, and represents a critical link in a causal chain that leads to the wide spectrum of neuronal dysfunctions and behavioural phenotypes observed in the juvenile, adult or aged offspring. Such diversity of phenotypic outcomes in the mIA model are mirrored by recent clinical evidence suggesting that infectious exposure during pregnancy is also associated with epilepsy and, to a lesser extent, cerebral palsy in children. Preclinical research also suggests that mIA might precipitate the development of Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Here, we summarize and critically review the emerging evidence that mIA is a shared environmental risk factor across CNS disorders that varies as a function of interactions between genetic and additional environmental factors.

Animal models have revealed maternal immune activation (mIA) to be a profound risk factor for neurochemical and behavioural abnormalities in the offspring. Microglial priming has been proposed as a major consequence of mIA, and represents a critical link in a causal chain that leads to the wide spectrum of neuronal dysfunctions and behavioural phenotypes observed in the juvenile, adult or aged offspring. Such diversity of phenotypic outcomes in the mIA model are mirrored by recent clinical evidence suggesting that infectious exposure during pregnancy is also associated with epilepsy and, to a lesser extent, cerebral palsy in children. Preclinical research also suggests that mIA might precipitate the development of Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Here, we summarize and critically review the emerging evidence that mIA is a shared environmental risk factor across CNS disorders that varies as a function of interactions between genetic and additional environmental factors. We also review ongoing clinical trials targeting immune pathways affected by mIA that may play a part in disease manifestation.

Maternal immune activation and strain specific interactions in the development of autism-like behaviors in mice Abstract: \"It is becoming increasingly apparent that the causes of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are due to both genetic and environmental factors. Animal studies provide important translational models for elucidating specific genetic or environmental factors that contribute to ASD-related behavioral deficits. For example, mouse research has demonstrated a link between maternal immune activation and the expression of ASD-like behaviors. Although these studies have provided insights into the potential causes of ASD, they are limited in their ability to model the important interactions between genetic variability and environmental insults. This is of particular concern given the broad spectrum of severity observed in the human population, suggesting that subpopulations may be more susceptible to the adverse effects of particular environmental insults. It is hypothesized that the severity of effects of maternal immune activation on ASD-like phenotypes is influenced by the genetic background in mice. To test this, pregnant dams of two inbred strains (that is, C57BL/6J and BTBR T \u00fe tf/J) were exposed to the viral mimic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C), and their offspring were tested for the presence and severity of ASD-like behaviors. To identify differences in immune system regulation, spleens were processed and measured for alterations in induced cytokine responses. Strain-treatment interactions were observed in social approach, ultrasonic vocalization, repetitive grooming and marble burying behaviors. Interestingly, persistent dysregulation of adaptive immune system function was only observed in BTBR mice.

Maternal immune activation evoked by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid does not evoke microglial cell activation in the embryo Abstract: \"Several studies have indicated that inflammation during pregnancy increases the risk for the development of neuropsychiatric disorders in the offspring. Morphological brain abnormalities combined with deviations in the inflammatory status of the brain can be observed in patients of both autism and schizophrenia.

In this study the poly (I:C) model was used to mimic viral immune activation in pregnant mice in order to assess the activation status of fetal microglia in these developmental disorders. Because microglia are the resident immune cells of the brain they were expected to be activated due to the inflammatory stimulus. Microglial cell density and activation level in the fetal cortex and hippocampus were determined. Despite the presence of a systemic inflammation in the pregnant mice, there was no significant difference in fetal microglial cell density or immunohistochemically determined activation level between the control and inflammation group.

Maternal immune activation in late gestation increases neuroinflammation and aggravates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the offspring Abstract: \"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by an autoimmune response against myelin antigens driven by autoreactive T cells. Several lines of evidence indicate that environmental factors, such as previous infection, can influence and trigger autoimmune responses.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of prenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during late gestation on the neuroinflammatory response in primary mixed glial cultures and on the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE, an animal model of MS) in the offspring. LPS (Escherichia coli 0127:B8, 120 lg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally to pregnant C57BL/6J mice on gestational day 17, and the offspring were assigned to two experiments: (1) mixed glial cultures generated using the brain of neonates, stimulated in vitro with LPS, and (2) adult offspring immunized with MOG35-55. The EAE clinical symptoms were followed for 30 days. Different sets of animals were sacrificed either during the onset (7 days post-immunization [p.i.]), when spleen and lymph nodes were collected, or the peak of disease (20 days p.i.), when CNS were collected for flow cytometry, cytokine production, and protein/mRNA-expression analysis. The primary CNS cultures from the LPStreated group produced exaggerated amounts of IL-6, IL-1b and nitrites after in vitro stimulus, while IL-10 production was lowered compared to the data of the control group. Prenatal exposure to LPS worsened EAE disease severity in adult offspring, and this worsening was linked to increased CNS-infiltrating macrophages, Th1 cells and Th17 cells at the peak of EAE severity; additionally, exacerbated gliosis was evidenced in microglia (MHC II) astrocytes level and immunoreactivity). The IL-2, IL-6 and IL-17 levels in the spleen and lymph nodes were increased in the offspring of the LPS-exposed dams.

Maternal Immune Activation in Nonhuman Primates Alters Social Attention in Juvenile Offspring Abstract: \"BACKGROUND: Sickness during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of offspring neurodevelopmental disorders. Rodent models have played a critical role in establishing causal relationships and identifying mechanisms of altered brain and behavior development in pups prenatally exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA). We recently developed a novel nonhuman primate model to bridge the gap between human epidemiological studies and rodent models of prenatal immune challenge. Our initial results demonstrated that rhesus monkeys given the viral mimic synthetic double-stranded RNA (polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid stabilized with poly-l-lysine) during pregnancy produce offspring with abnormal repetitive behaviors, altered communication, and atypical social interactions. METHODS: We utilized noninvasive infrared eye tracking to further evaluate social processing capabilities in a subset of the first trimester MIA-exposed offspring (n 5 4) and control animals (n 5 4) from our previous study. RESULTS: As juveniles, the MIA offspring differed from control animals on several measures of social attention, particularly when viewing macaque faces depicting the fear grimace facial expression. Compared with control animals, MIA offspring had a longer latency before fixating on the eyes, had fewer fixations directed at the eyes, and spent less total time fixating on the eyes of the fear grimace images. CONCLUSIONS: In the rhesus monkey model, exposure to MIA at the end of the first trimester results in abnormal gaze patterns to salient social information.

Maternal immune activation produces neonatal excitability defects in offspring hippocampal neurons from pregnant rats treated with poly I:C Abstract: \"Maternal immune activation (MIA) resulting from prenatal exposure to infectious pathogens or inflammatory stimuli is increasingly recognized to play an important etiological role in neuropsychiatric disorders with neurodevelopmental features.

Previous MIA studies using poly I:C prenatal treatment suggested that neurophysiological alterations occur in the hippocampus. However, these investigations used only juvenile or adult animals. We postulated that MIA-induced alterations could occur earlier at neonatal/early postnatal stages. Here we examined the neurophysiological properties of cultured pyramidal-like hippocampal neurons prepared from neonatal (P0-P2) offspring of pregnant rats injected with poly I:C. Offspring neurons from poly I:C-treated mothers exhibited significantly lower intrinsic excitability and stronger spike frequency adaptation, compared to saline. A similar lower intrinsic excitability was observed in CA1 pyramidal neurons from hippocampal slices of two weeks-old poly I:C offspring. Cultured hippocampal neurons also displayed lower frequency of spontaneous firing, higher charge transfer of IPSCs and larger amplitude of miniature IPSCs.

Maternal immune activation yields offspring displaying mouse versions of the three core symptoms of autism Abstract: \"The core symptoms of autism are deficits in social interaction and language, and the presence of repetitive/stereotyped behaviors.

We stimulate the maternal immune system by injecting the viral mimic poly(I:C) during pregnancy, and analyze the social and communicative behaviors of the offspring. In one test, young pups respond to a brief separation from the mother with ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). We find that, compared to pups born to saline-injected mothers, pups born to maternal immune activation (MIA) mothers produce a lower rate of USVs in the isolation test starting at day 8. The quality of the vocalizations is also different; analysis of sound spectrograms of ten day-old pups shows that male pups from MIA mothers emit significantly fewer harmonic and more complex and short syllables. These communication differences are also apparent in adult offspring. Compared to controls, adult MIA males emit significantly fewer USVs in response to social encounters with females or males, and display reduced scent marking in response to female urine. Regarding a second autism symptom, MIA males display decreased sociability. In a third test of characteristic autism behaviors, MIA offspring exhibit increased repetitive/stereotyped behavior in both marble burying and self-grooming tests.

Maternal Influenza Infection Causes Marked Behavioral and Pharmacological Changes in the Offspring Abstract: \"Maternal viral infection is known to increase the risk for schizophrenia and autism in the offspring. Using this observation in an animal model, we find that respiratory infection of pregnant mice (both BALB/c and C57BL/6 strains) with the human influenza virus yields offspring that display highly abnormal behavioral responses as adults. As in schizophrenia and autism, these offspring display deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI) in the acoustic startle response. Compared with control mice, the infected mice also display striking responses to the acute administration of antipsychotic (clozapine and chlorpromazine) and psychomimetic (ketamine) drugs. Moreover, these mice are deficient in exploratory behavior in both open-field and novel-object tests, and they are deficient in social interaction. At least some of these behavioral changes likely are attributable to the maternal immune response itself. That is, maternal injection of the synthetic double-stranded RNA polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid causes a PPI deficit in the offspring in the absence of virus.

Mechanism of immunopotentiation and safety of aluminum adjuvants Abstract: \"Aluminum-containing adjuvants are widely used in preventive vaccines against infectious diseases and in preparations for allergy immunotherapy. The mechanism by which they enhance the immune response remains poorly understood. Aluminum adjuvants selectively stimulate a Th2 immune response upon injection of mice and a mixed response in human beings. They support activation of CD8 T cells, but these cells do not undergo terminal differentiation to cytotoxic T cells. Adsorption of antigens to aluminum adjuvants enhances the immune response by facilitating phagocytosis and slowing the diffusion of antigens from the injection site which allows time for inflammatory cells to accumulate. The adsorptive strength is important as high affinity interactions interfere with the immune response. Adsorption can also affect the physical and chemical stability of antigens. Aluminum adjuvants activate dendritic cells via direct and indirect mechanisms. Phagocytosis of aluminum adjuvants followed by disruption of the phagolysosome activates NLRP3- inflammasomes resulting in the release of active IL-1 and IL-18. Aluminum adjuvants also activate dendritic cells by binding to membrane lipid rafts. Injection of aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines causes the release of uric acid, DNA, and ATP from damaged cells which in turn activate dendritic cells. The use of aluminum adjuvant is limited by weak stimulation of cell-mediated immunity. This can be enhanced by addition of other immunomodulatory molecules. Adsorption of these molecules is determined by the same mechanisms that control adsorption of antigens and can affect the efficacy of such combination adjuvants. The widespread use of aluminum adjuvants can be attributed in part to the excellent safety record based on a 70-year history of use. They cause local inflammation at the injection site, but also reduce the severity of systemic and local reactions by binding biologically active molecules in vaccines.\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23335921 \"Aluminum-containing adjuvants are widely used in preventive vaccines against infectious diseases and in preparations for allergy immunotherapy.

Indeed, modeling this risk factor in mice through maternal immune activation (MIA) causes ASD- and SZ-like neuropathologies and behaviors in the offspring. Although MIA upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines in the fetal brain, whether MIA leads to long-lasting changes in brain cytokines during postnatal development remains unknown. Here, we tested this possibility by measuring protein levels of 23 cytokines in the blood and three brain regions from offspring of poly(I:C)- and saline-injected mice at five postnatal ages using multiplex arrays. Most cytokines examined are present in sera and brains throughout development. MIA induces changes in the levels of many cytokines in the brains and sera of offspring in a region- and age-specific manner. These MIA-induced changes follow a few, unexpected and distinct patterns. In frontal and cingulate cortices, several, mostly pro-inflammatory, cytokines are elevated at birth, followed by decreases during periods of synaptogenesis and plasticity, and increases again in the adult. Cytokines are also altered in postnatal hippocampus, but in a pattern distinct from the other regions. The MIA-induced changes in brain cytokines do not correlate with changes in serum cytokines from the same animals. Finally, these MIA-induced cytokine changes are not accompanied by breaches in the blood- brain barrier, immune cell infiltration or increases in microglial density.

Maternal immune activation of cytokines IL-1 and IL-13, chemokine MCP-1 and colony stimulating factor VEGF in fetal mouse brain Abstract: \"Background: Maternal viral infection during pregnancy is associated with an increase in the incidence of psychiatric disorders with presumed neurodevelopmental origin, including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. The enhanced risk for developing mental illness appears to be caused by deleterious effects of innate immune response-associated factors on the development of the central nervous system, which predispose the offspring to pathological behaviors in adolescence and adulthood. To identify the immune response-associated soluble factors that may affect central nervous system development, we examined the effect of innate immune response activation by polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic analogue of viral double-stranded RNA, on the expression levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and colony stimulating factors in fetal and postnatal mouse brain 6 h and 24 h after treatment. Methods: C57BL/6J pregnant mice (gestational day 16) or newborn mice (postnatal day 4) received a single intraperitoneal injection of the synthetic analogue of viral double-stranded RNA poly(I:C) (20 mg/kg). Thirty-two immune response-associated soluble factors, including pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and colony stimulating factors, were assayed 6 h and 24 h after poly(I:C) injection using multiplexed bead-based immunoassay (Milliplex Map) and processed in a Luminex 100 IS instrument. Results: Maternal exposure to poly(I:C) at gestational day 16 induced a significant increase in cytokines interleukin (IL)-1, (IP)-10 and monokine induced by IFN-gamma (MIG); and in the colony stimulating factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the fetal brain. IL-1 showed the highest concentration levels in fetal brains and was the only cytokine significantly up-regulated 24 h after maternal poly(I:C) injection, suggesting that IL-1 may have a deleterious impact on central nervous system development. In contrast, poly(I:C) treatment of postnatal day 4 pups induced a pronounced rise in chemokines and colony stimulating factors in their brains instead of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1. Conclusions: This study identified a significant increase in the concentration levels of the cytokines IL-1 and IL-13, the chemokine MCP-1 and the colony stimulating factor VEGF in the developing central nervous system during activation of an innate immune response, suggesting that these factors are mediators of the noxious effects of maternal immune activation on central nervous system development, with potential long-lasting effects on animal behavior.\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22546005 \"Background: Maternal viral infection during pregnancy is associated with an increase in the incidence of psychiatric disorders with presumed neurodevelopmental origin, including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia.

MATERNAL INFECTION AND IMMUNE INVOLVEMENT IN AUTISM Abstract: \"Recent studies have highlighted a connection between infection during pregnancy and increased risk for autism in the offspring. Parallel studies of cerebral spinal fluid, blood, and postmortem brains reveal an ongoing, hyper-responsive inflammatory-like state in many young as well as adult autism subjects. There are also indications of gastrointestinal problems in at least a subset of autistic children. Work with animal models of the maternal infection risk factor indicate that aspects of brain and peripheral immune dysregulation can be begin during fetal development and be maintained through adulthood. The offspring of infected, or immune-activated dams also display cardinal behavioral features of autism, as well as neuropathology consistent with that seen in human autism.

The Time of Prenatal Immune Challenge Determines the Specificity of Inflammation-Mediated Brain and Behavioral Pathology Abstract: \"Disturbance to early brain development is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, and mental retardation. Epidemiological studies have indicated that the risk of developing these disorders is enhanced by prenatal maternal infection, presumably as a result of neurodevelopmental defects triggered by cytokine-related inflammatory events. Here, we demonstrate that the effects of maternal immune challenge between middle and late gestation periods in mice are dissociable in terms of fetal brain cytokine responses to maternal inflammation and the pathological consequences in brain and behavior. Specifically, the relative expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the fetal brains in response to maternal immune challenge may be an important determinant among other developmental factors for the precise pathological profile emerging in later life. Thus, the middle and late gestation periods correspond to two windows with differing vulnerability to adult behavioral dysfunction, brain neuropathology in early adolescence, and of the acute cytokine responses in the fetal brain.\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16672647 \"Disturbance to early brain development is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, and mental retardation.

Microglial Activation in Young Adults With Autism Spectrum Disorder Abstract: \"Context: A growing body of evidence suggests that aberrant immunologic systems underlie the pathophysiologic characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Objectives: To identify brain regions associated with excessively activated microglia in the whole brain, and to examine similarities in the pattern of distribution of activated microglia in subjects with ASD and control subjects. Design: Case-control study using positron Subjects recruited from the Participants: Twenty men with ASD (age range, 18-31 years; mean [SD] IQ, 95.9 [16.7]) and 20 age- and IQmatched healthy men as controls. Diagnosis of ASD was made in accordance with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and the Autism Diagnostic Interview- Revised. Main Outcome Measures: Regional brain [11C](R)- PK11195 binding potential as a representative measure of microglial activation. Results: The [11C](R)-PK11195 binding potential values were significantly higher in multiple brain regions in young adults with ASD compared with those of controls (P.05, corrected). Brain regions with increased binding potentials included the cerebellum, midbrain, pons, fusiform gyri, and the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices. The most prominent increase was observed in the cerebellum.

Molecular Mechanisms Involved in Injury to the Preterm Brain Abstract: \"Injury to the premature brain is a major contributor to infant mortality and morbidity, often leading to mental retardation and sensory-motor impairment. The disease process is believed to be caused, sustained, and aggravated by multiple perinatal factors that team up in a multi-hit fashion. Clinical, epidemiological, and experimental studies have revealed that key factors such as inflammation, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress contribute considerably to white- and graymatter injury in premature infants, whose brains are particularly susceptible to damage. Depending on the timing, lesions of the immature brain may influence developmental events in their natural sequence and redirect subsequent development.

Neonatal inflammation alters N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit mRNA in the adult rat brain Abstract: \"Peripheral inflammation causes production of central cytokines that alter transmission at the Nmethyl-D-aspartate receptor (NR). During development, NRs are important for synaptic plasticity and network connectivity. We therefore asked if neonatal inflammation would alter expression of NRs in the brain and behavioural performance in adulthood. We gave lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 g/kg, i.p.) or saline to postnatal P14, P30 or P77. Subsequently we assessed mRNA levels of the NR1, NR2A, B, C and D subunits in the hippocampus and cortex either acutely (2 h) or in adulthood using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. We explored learning and memory behaviours in adult rats using the Morris water maze and contextual fear conditioning paradigms. Hippocampal NR1 mRNA was acutely increased in the P5- and P77-treated rats but was reduced in adults treated with LPS at P5, P30 and P77. P14 LPS-treated rats showed few acute changes but showed pronounced increases in NR2A, B, C and D subunit mRNA later in adulthood. The cortex displayed relatively few acute changes in expression in the neonatal-treated rats; however, it showed robust changes in NR2B, C and D mRNA in all groups given LPS in adulthood. Behavioural deficits were observed specifically in the P5 and P30 LPS-treated groups in the water maze probe trial and fear conditioning tests, consistent with hippocampal NR1 mRNA down-regulation. Thus, a single bout of inflammation during development can programme specific and persistent differences in NR mRNA subunit expression in the hippocampus, which could be associated with behavioural and cognitive deficits in adulthood.\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18279317 \"Peripheral inflammation causes production of central cytokines that alter transmission at the Nmethyl-D-aspartate receptor (NR).

Neuroglial Activation and Neuroinflammation in the Brain of Patients with Autism Abstract: \"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired communication and social interaction and may be accompanied by mental retardation and epilepsy. Its cause remains unknown, despite evidence that genetic, environmental, and immunological factors may play a role in its pathogenesis. To investigate whether immune-mediated mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of autism, we used immunocytochemistry, cytokine protein arrays, and enzymelinked immunosorbent assays to study brain tissues and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from autistic patients and determined the magnitude of neuroglial and inflammatory reactions and their cytokine expression profiles. Brain tissues from cerebellum, midfrontal, and cingulate gyrus obtained at autopsy from 11 patients with autism were used for morphological studies. Fresh-frozen tissues available from seven patients and CSF from six living autistic patients were used for cytokine protein profiling. We demonstrate an active neuroinflammatory process in the cerebral cortex, white matter, and notably in cerebellum of autistic patients. Immunocytochemical studies showed marked activation of microglia and astroglia, and cytokine profiling indicated that macrophage chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor growth factor-1, derived from neuroglia, were the most prevalent cytokines in brain tissues. CSF showed a unique proinflammatory profile of cytokines, including a marked increase in MCP-1.

Neurologic disease induced in transgenic mice by cerebral overexpression of interleukin 6 Abstract: \"Cytokines are thought to be important mediators in physiologic and pathophysiologic processes affecting the central nervous system (CNS).

Mood, Interleukin-6 in Adults During Immune Activation: A Pilot Study to Assess Sickness Behaviors in Humans Abstract: \"Objectives: Sickness behavior, a suite of behavioral changes subsequent to infection that includes depression, decreased social behaviors, and sleep disturbances, has been well described in model organisms. The phenomenon is relatively unexplored in humans due to methodological difficulties, and hormonal correlates of sickness behavior have not been studied. We therefore attempted to use a vaccine to elicit sickness behaviors outside of a clinical setting and uncover any correlations among testosterone, cortisol, and sickness behavior. Methods: Eleven participants (five male, six female, mean age 22.8 years) na\u20acve to the rabies vaccine were recruited from the School of Veterinary Medicine at Purdue University. Participants provided daily saliva and urine samples and completed questionnaires to assess mood and social behaviors for a period of 6 weeks. Saliva samples were assayed for cortisol and testosterone. Urine samples were assayed for interleukin-6 and creatinine. Results: Analysis revealed an expected decrease in testosterone and an increase in cortisol. While mood did not differ, other behaviors, such as physical activity and hours slept, showed expected changes following vaccination. However, none of these results achieved statistical significance. Conclusion: Our results, while generally confirming previous research on sickness behavior and hormone changes during infection, are suggestive, but not statistically significant and so neither confirm nor contradict our hypotheses. We attribute this lack of significance to both the small sample size, as well as possible confounding factors, including the psychosocial stress of entering an intensive study program\" Link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.22608/full \"Objectives: Sickness behavior, a suite of behavioral changes subsequent to infection that includes depression, decreased social behaviors, and sleep disturbances, has been well described in model organisms.

Normal gut microbiota modulates brain development and behavior Abstract: \"Microbial colonization of mammals is an evolution-driven process that modulate host physiology, many of which are associated with immunity and nutrient intake. Here, we report that colonization by gut microbiota impacts mammalian brain development and subsequent adult behavior. Using measures of motor activity and anxiety-like behavior, we demonstrate that germ free (GF) mice display increased motor activity and reduced anxiety, compared with specific pathogen free (SPF) mice with a normal gut microbiota. This behavioral phenotype is associated with altered expression of genes known to be involved in second messenger pathways and synaptic long-term potentiation in brain regions implicated in motor control and anxiety-like behavior. GF mice exposed to gut microbiota early in life display similar characteristics as SPF mice, including reduced expression of PSD-95 and synaptophysin in the striatum. Hence, our results suggest that the microbial colonization process initiates signaling mechanisms that affect neuronal circuits involved in motor control and anxiety behavior.\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21282636 \"Microbial colonization of mammals is an evolution-driven process that modulate host physiology, many of which are associated with immunity and nutrient intake.

Pediatric Reference Ranges for Proinflammatory noninflammatory neurological disorders (NIND). The multiplex bead assay technology was used for simultaneous measurement of 34 soluble cytokines/ chemokines in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 73 NIND. Sera from 36 healthy children and 37 NIND also were analyzed. In CSF, CXCL10 had the highest concentration; CCL2, CXCL10, and interleukin (IL)-6 detectable CXCL8, CCL22, CXCL1, IL-16, and IL-1 receptor antagonist were found in 50% of the samples. In serum, CXCL1 had the highest concentration; sIL-2Ra, CXCL1, CXCL10, CCL5, and granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were found in 50% of the samples. The mean CSF:serum ratio for CCL2 was several-fold higher than the rest, with the CXCL10 and CXCL8 ratios also > 1. Intercorrelations between CSF cytokines included CCL2 versus CXCL8 and IL-4. For serum cytokines, the agreement between healthy children and NIND was good, with the exception of higher CCL4 in NIND. Cytokines in children varied greatly in concentration and detectability, with chemokines predominating in the CSF.

Peripheral inflammation increases seizure susceptibility via the induction of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the hippocampus Abstract: activation of microglia and production of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain plays an active role in epileptic disorders. Brain oxidative stress has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Damage in the hippocampus is associated with temporal lobe epilepsy, a common form of epilepsy in human. Peripheral inflammation may exacerbate neuroinflammation and brain oxidative stress. This study examined the impact of peripheral inflammation on seizure susceptibility and the involvement of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the hippocampus. Results: In male, adult Sprague-Dawley rats, peripheral inflammation was induced by the infusion of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 2.5 mg/kg/day) into the peritoneal cavity for 7 days via an osmotic minipump. Pharmacological agents were delivered via intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion with an osmotic minipump. The level of cytokine in plasma or hippocampus was analyzed by ELISA. Redox-related protein expression in hippocampus was evaluated by Western blot. Seizure susceptibility was tested by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of kainic acid (KA, 10 mg/kg). We found that i.p. infusion of LPS for 7 days induced peripheral inflammation characterized by the increases in plasma levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-). This is associated with a significant increase in number of the activated microglia (Iba-1+ cells), enhanced production of cytokines NADPH oxidase subunits) in the hippocampus. These cellular and molecular responses to peripheral inflammation were notably blunted by i.c.v. infusion of a cycloxygenase-2 inhibitor, NS398 (5 infusion of tempol g/l/h), a reactive oxygen species scavenger, protected the hippocampus from oxidative damage with no apparent effect on microglia activation or cytokine production after peripheral inflammation. In the KA-induced seizure model, i.c.v. infusion of both NS398 and tempol ameliorated the increase in seizure susceptibility in animals succumbed to the LPS-induced peripheral inflammation. Conclusions: Together these results indicated that LPS-induced peripheral inflammation evoked neuroinflammation and the subsequent oxidative stress in the hippocampus, resulting in the increase in KA-induced seizure susceptibility.

Preliminary evidence of neuropathology in nonhuman primates prenatally exposed to maternal immune activation Abstract: \"Maternal infection during pregnancy increases the risk for neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring. Rodent models have played a critical role in establishing maternal immune activation (MIA) as a causal factor for altered brain and behavioral development in offspring. We recently extended these findings to a species more closely related to humans by demonstrating that rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) prenatally exposed to MIA also develop abnormal behaviors. Here, for the first time, we present initial evidence of underlying brain pathology in this novel nonhuman primate MIA model. Pregnant rhesus monkeys were injected with a modified form of the viral mimic polyI:C (poly ICLC) or saline at the end of the first trimester. Brain tissue was collected from the offspring at 3.5 years and blocks of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA46) were used to analyze and spine density using the Golgi-Cox impregnation method. For each case, 10 layer III pyramidal cells were traced in their entirety, including all apical, oblique and basal dendrites, and their spines. We further analyzed somal size and apical dendrite trunk morphology in 30 cells per case over a 30 lm section located 100 \u00b1 10 lm from the soma.

Prenatal Activation of Microglia of Glutamatergic Synaptic Function Abstract: \"Background: Epidemiological studies have linked maternal infection during pregnancy to later development of neuropsychiatric disorders in the offspring. In mice, experimental inflammation during embryonic development impairs behavioral and cognitive performances in adulthood. Synaptic dysfunctions may be at the origin of cognitive impairments, however the link between prenatal inflammation and synaptic defects remains to be established. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we show that prenatal alteration of microglial function, including inflammation, induces delayed synaptic dysfunction in the adult. DAP12 is a microglial signaling protein expressed around birth, mutations of which in the human induces the Nasu-Hakola disease, characterized by early dementia. We presently report that synaptic excitatory currents in mice bearing a loss-of-function mutation in the DAP12 gene (DAP12KI mice) display enhanced relative contribution of AMPA. Furthermore, neurons from DAP12KI P0 pups cultured without microglia develop similar synaptic alterations, suggesting that a prenatal dysfunction of microglia may impact synaptic function in the adult. As we observed that DAP12KI microglia overexpress genes for IL1b, IL6 and NOS2, which are inflammatory proteins, we analyzed the impact of a pharmacologically-induced prenatal inflammation on synaptic function. Maternal injection of lipopolysaccharides induced activation of microglia at birth and alteration of glutamatergic synapses in the adult offspring. Finally, neurons cultured from neonates born to inflamed mothers and cultured without microglia also displayed altered neuronal activity. Conclusion/Significance: Our results demonstrate that prenatal inflammation is sufficient to induce synaptic alterations with delay. We propose that these alterations triggered by prenatal activation of microglia provide a cellular basis for the neuropsychiatric defects induced by prenatal inflammation.\" Link: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002595 \"Background: Epidemiological studies have linked maternal infection during pregnancy to later development of neuropsychiatric disorders in the offspring.

We have previously shown that prenatal activation of toll-like receptor 4 by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces IL-6-dependent STAT-3 signaling pathway in the fetal brain.

Because corticosterone, the end-product of HPA axis activity in rats, alters neurogenesis we tested whether this enhanced HPA axis responsiveness in adult male offspring played a role in the long lasting impact of LPS on neurogenesis during adulthood. Pregnant rats were given either LPS, or LPS and an IL-6 neutralizing antibody (IL-6Ab). The newly born neurons were monitored in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus of adult male offspring monitoring doublecortin and T-box brain protein-2 expression: two well-established markers of newly born neurons.

This decreased number of newly born neurons in the DG was absent when IL-6Ab was co-injected with LPS during pregnancy.

Prenatal and postnatal maternal contributions in the infection model of schizophrenia Abstract: \"Epidemiological studies have indicated that the risk of schizophrenia is enhanced by prenatal maternal infection with viral or bacterial pathogens.

Prenatal maternal immune activation causes epigenetic differences in adolescent mouse brain Abstract: \"Epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation have been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders including schizophrenia and autism. Epigenetic changes can be induced by environmental exposures such as inflammation. Here we tested the hypothesis that prenatal inflammation, a recognized risk factor for schizophrenia and related neurodevelopmental conditions, alters DNA methylation in key brain regions linked to schizophrenia, namely the dopamine rich striatum and endocrine regulatory centre, the hypothalamus. DNA methylation across highly repetitive elements (long interspersed element 1 (LINE1) and intracisternal A-particles (IAPs)) were used to proxy global DNA methylation. We also investigated the Mecp2 gene because it regulates transcription of LINE1 and has a known association with neurodevelopmental disorders. Brain tissue was harvested from 6 week old offspring of mice exposed to the viral analog PolyI:C or saline on gestation day 9. We used Sequenom EpiTYPER assay to quantitatively analyze differences in DNA methylation at IAPs, LINE1 elements and the promoter region of Mecp2. In the hypothalamus, prenatal exposure to PolyI:C caused significant global DNA hypomethylation (t = 2.44, P = 0.019, PolyI:C mean 69.67%, saline mean 70.19%), especially in females, and significant hypomethylation of the promoter region of Mecp2, (t = 3.32, DNA methylation in the striatum was not significantly altered. This study provides the first experimental evidence that exposure to inflammation during prenatal life is associated with epigenetic changes, including Mecp2 promoter hypomethylation.

The currently existing models are based on maternal gestational exposure to human influenza virus, the viral mimic polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid [Poly(I:C)], the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, the locally acting inflammatory agent turpentine, or selected inflammatory cytokines. These models are pivotal for establishing causal relationships and for identifying cellular and molecular mechanisms that affect normal brain development in the event of early-life immune exposures. An important aspect of developmental immune activation models is that they allow a multifaceted, longitudinal monitoring of the disease process as it unfolds during the course of neurodevelopment from prenatal to adult stages of life. An important recent refinement of these models is the incorporation of multiple etiologically relevant risk factors by combining prenatal immune challenges with specific genetic manipulations or additional environmental adversities. Converging findings from such recent experimental attempts suggest that prenatal infection can act as a \"neurodevelopmental disease primer\" that is likely relevant for a number of chronic mental illnesses. Hence, the adverse effects induced by prenatal infection might reflect an early entry into the neuropsychiatric route, but the specificity of subsequent disease or symptoms is likely to be strongly influenced by the genetic and environmental context in which the prenatal infectious process occurs.\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23938317 \"It is increasingly appreciated that altered neuroimmune mechanisms might play a role in the development of schizophrenia and related psychotic illnesses.

Priming of Metabolic Dysfunctions by Activation in Mice: Relevance to Schizophrenia Abstract: \"Schizophrenia is associated with increased risk for multiple metabolic abnormalities, including altered glucose homeostasis, type-2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Some of the metabolic alterations can already exist in psychosis-prone subjects prior to the onset of chronic schizophrenic disease and pharmacotherapy, indicating that they may have a developmental origin. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that metabolic alterations pertinent to schizophrenic disease can be primed by an environmental risk factor associated with the disorder, namely prenatal exposure to immune challenge. We used a well-established mouse model of prenatal immune challenge induced by maternal gestational treatment with poly(I:C) (5''polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid''), an analog of double-stranded RNA that stimulates a cytokine-associated viral-like acute phase response. Metabolic effects were studied using highresolution computed tomography and fully automated indirect calorimetry system, along with an oral glucose tolerance test and plasma cytokine and corticosterone measurements. We found that prenatal immune activation caused altered glycemic regulation and abnormal ingestive behavior in periadolescence and led to an adult onset of excess visceral and subcutaneous fat deposition. These effects were accompanied by age-dependent changes in peripheral secretion of proinflammatory (interleukin [IL]-6 and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-a) and T cell-related (IL-2 and interferon [IFN]- g) cytokines and by increased release of the stress hormone corticosterone in periadolescence. Our findings show that schizophrenia-relevant metabolic and physiological abnormalities can be primed by prenatal viral-like immune activation, but at the same time, our study emphasizes that this environmental insult is unlikely to precipitate the full spectrum of metabolic and immunological changes pertinent to chronic schizophrenic disease.\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22186136 \"Schizophrenia is associated with increased risk for multiple metabolic abnormalities, including altered glucose homeostasis, type-2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.

Reduced GABAergic Action in the Autistic Abstract: \"An imbalance between excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission has been posited as a central characteristic of the neurobiology of autism [1], inspired in part by the striking prevalence of seizures among individuals with the disorder [2]. Evidence supporting this hypothesis has specifically implicated the signaling pathway of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, g-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in this putative imbalance: GABA receptor genes have been associated with autism in linkage and copy number variation studies [3-7], fewer GABA receptor subunits have been observed in the post-mortem tissue of autistic individuals [8, 9], and GABAergic signaling is disrupted across heterogeneous mouse models of autism [10]. Yet, empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis in humans is lacking, leaving a gulf between animal and human studies of the condition. Here, we present a direct link between GABA signaling and autistic perceptual symptomatology. We first demonstrate a robust, replicated autistic deficit in binocular rivalry [11], a basic visual function that is thought to rely on the balance of excitation/inhibition in visual cortex [12-15]. Then, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we demonstrate a tight linkage between binocular rivalry dynamics in typical participants and both GABA and glutamate levels in the visual cortex. Finally, we show that the link between GABA and binocular rivalry dynamics is completely and specifically absent in autism.

Regulation of IL-6 system in cerebrospinal fluid and serum compartments by seizures: the effect of seizure type and duration Abstract: \"Experimental studies suggest that cytokine production may be triggered by seizure activity. Here we determined the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its soluble receptor components (sIL-6R and sGp130) in CSF and serum from control subjects and patients after different types of seizures.

Relative Prenatal and Postnatal Maternal Contributions to Schizophrenia-Related Neurochemical Dysfunction after In Utero Immune Challenge Abstract: \"Prenatal exposure to infections represents a risk factor for the emergence of neuropsychiatric disorders in later life, including schizophrenia and autism. However, it remains essentially unknown whether this association is primarily attributable to prenatal and/or postnatal maternal effects on the offspring. Here, we addressed this issue by dissecting the relative contributions of prenatal inflammatory events and postnatal maternal factors in an animal model of prenatal viral-like infection. Pregnant mice were exposed to the inflammatory agent polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (PolyI:C; 5 mg/kg, i.v.) or vehicle treatment on gestation day 9, and offspring born to PolyI:Cand vehicle-treated dams were cross fostered to surrogate rearing mothers that had either experienced inflammatory or sham treatment during pregnancy. We demonstrate that a variety of dopamine- and glutamate-related pharmacological and neuroanatomical disturbances emerge after prenatal immune challenge regardless of whether neonates were raised by vehicle- or PolyI:C-exposed surrogate mothers. However, the adoption of prenatal control animals to immune-challenged surrogate mothers was also sufficient to induce specific pharmacological and neuroanatomical abnormalities in the fostered offspring. Multiple schizophrenia-related dysfunctions emerging after prenatal immune challenge are thus mediated by prenatal but not postnatal maternal effects on the offspring, but immunological stress during pregnancy may affect postpartum maternal factors in such a way that being reared by an immune-challenged surrogate mother can confer risk for distinct forms of psychopathology in adult life\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17443130 \"Prenatal exposure to infections represents a risk factor for the emergence of neuropsychiatric disorders in later life, including schizophrenia and autism.

Prenatal Poly(I:C) treatment induced the expected sensory gating deficits (pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response) in 100 day-old adult offspring, but only in female not in male descendants. No PPI-deficits were present in 30 day-old adolescent mice. Sensory gating deficits in adult females were preceded by a strong M1-type microglia polarization pattern during puberty as determined by flow cytometric analysis of multiple pro- and anti-inflammatory surface markers. Microglia activation in females did not persist until adulthood and was absent in behaviorally unaffected male descendants. Further, the specific activation pattern of microglia was not mirrored by a similar activation of peripheral immune cells.

Potential Role of Selenoenzymes and Antioxidant Metabolism in relation to Autism Etiology and Pathology Abstract: \"Autism and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are behaviorally defined, but the biochemical pathogenesis of the underlying disease process remains uncharacterized. Studies indicate that antioxidant status is diminished in autistic subjects, suggesting its pathology is associated with augmented production of oxidative species and/or compromised antioxidant metabolism.This suggests ASD may result from defects in the metabolism of cellular antioxidants which maintain intracellular redox status by quenching reactive oxygen species (ROS). Selenium-dependent enzymes (selenoenzymes) are important in maintaining intercellular reducing conditions, particularly in the brain. Selenoenzymes are a family of 25 genetically unique proteins, several of which have roles in preventing and reversing oxidative damage in brain and endocrine tissues. Since the brain's high rate of oxygen consumption is accompanied by high ROS production, selenoenzyme activities are particularly important in this tissue. Because selenoenzymes can be irreversibly inhibited by many electrophiles, exposure to these organic and inorganic agents can diminish selenoenzymedependent antioxidant functions. This can impair brain development, particularly via the adverse influence of oxidative stress on epigenetic regulation. Here we review the physiological roles of selenoproteins in relation to potential biochemical mechanisms of ASD etiology and pathology.\" Link: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aurt/2014/164938/ \"Autism and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are behaviorally defined, but the biochemical pathogenesis of the underlying disease process remains uncharacterized.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Repeated immunization with antigen causes systemic autoimmunity in mice otherwise not prone to spontaneous autoimmune diseases. Overstimulation of CD4+ T cells led to the development of autoantibody-inducing CD4+ T (aiCD4+ T) cell which had undergone T cell receptor (TCR) revision and was capable of inducing autoantibodies. The aiCD4+ T cell was induced by de novo TCR revision but not by cross-reaction, and subsequently overstimulated CD8+ T cells, driving them to become antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). These CTLs could be further matured by antigen crosspresentation, after which they caused autoimmune tissue injury akin to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

SYSTEMIC INFECTION AND INFLAMMATION IN ACUTE CNS INJURY AND CHRONIC NEURODEGENERATION: UNDERLYING MECHANISMS Abstract: \"We have all at some time experienced the nonspecific symptoms that arise from being ill following a systemic infection. These symptoms, such as fever, malaise, lethargy and loss of appetite are often referred to as \"sickness behavior\" and are a consequence of systemically produced pro-inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators signal to the brain, leading to activation of microglial cells, which in turn, signal to neurons to induce adaptive metabolic and behavioral changes. In normal healthy persons this response is a normal part of our defense, to protect us from infection, to maintain homeostasis and causes no damage to neurons. However, in animals and patients with chronic neurodegenerative disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke and even during normal aging, systemic inflammation leads to inflammatory responses in the brain, an exaggeration of clinical symptoms and increased neuronal death. These observations imply that, as the population ages and the number of individuals with CNS disorders increases, relatively common systemic infections and inflammation will become significant risk factors for disease onset or progression.

These symptoms, such as fever, malaise, lethargy and loss of appetite are often referred to as \"sickness behavior\" and are a consequence of systemically produced pro-inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators signal to the brain, leading to activation of microglial cells, which in turn, signal to neurons to induce adaptive metabolic and behavioral changes. In normal healthy persons this response is a normal part of our defense, to protect us from infection, to maintain homeostasis and causes no damage to neurons.

Systemic inflammation and microglial activation: systematic review of animal experiments Abstract: \"Background: Animal studies show that peripheral inflammatory stimuli may activate microglial cells in the brain implicating an important role for microglia in sepsis-associated delirium. We systematically reviewed animal experiments related to the effects of systemic inflammation on the microglial and inflammatory response in the brain. Methods: We searched PubMed between January 1, 1950 and December 1, 2013 and Embase between January 1, 1988 and December 1, 2013 for animal studies on the influence of peripheral inflammatory stimuli on microglia and the brain. Identified studies were systematically scored on methodological quality. Two investigators extracted independently data on animal species, gender, age, and genetic background; number of animals; infectious stimulus; microglial cells; and other inflammatory parameters in the brain, including methods, time points after inoculation, and brain regions. Results: Fifty-one studies were identified of which the majority was performed in mice (n = 30) or in rats (n = 19). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (dose ranging between 0.33 and 200 mg/kg) was used as a peripheral infectious stimulus in 39 studies (76 %), and live or heat-killed pathogens were used in 12 studies (24 %). Information about animal characteristics such as species, strain, sex, age, and weight were defined in 41 studies (80 %), and complete methods of the disease model were described in 35 studies (68 %). Studies were also heterogeneous with respect to methods used to assess microglial activation; markers used mostly were the ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1), cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68), and CD11b. After LPS challenge microglial activation was seen 6 h after challenge and remained present for at least 3 days. Live Escherichia coli resulted in microglial activation after 2 days, and heat-killed bacteria after 2 weeks. Concomitant with microglial response, inflammatory parameters in the brain were reviewed in 23 of 51 studies (45 %). Microglial activation was associated with an increase in Toll-like receptor (TLR-2 and TLR-4), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression or protein levels. Interpretation: Animal experiments robustly showed that peripheral inflammatory stimuli cause microglial activation. We observed distinct differences in microglial activation between systemic stimulation with (supranatural doses) LPS and live or heat-killed bacteria.\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26048578 \"Background: Animal studies show that peripheral inflammatory stimuli may activate microglial cells in the brain implicating an important role for microglia in sepsis-associated delirium.

Neuroinflammation and Behavioral Abnormalities Treatment in Rats: Implications for Autism Abstract: \"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder presenting before 3 years of age with deficits in communication and social skills and repetitive behaviors. In addition to genetic influences, recent studies suggest that prenatal drug or chemical exposures are risk factors for autism. Terbutaline, a 2-adrenoceptor agonist used to arrest preterm labor, has been associated with increased concordance for autism in dizygotic twins. We studied the effects of terbutaline on microglial activation in different brain regions and behavioral outcomes in developing rats. Newborn rats were given terbutaline (10 mg/kg) daily on postnatal days (PN) 2 to 5 or PN 11 to 14 and examined 24 h after the last dose and at PN 30. Immunohistochemical studies showed that administration of terbutaline on PN 2 to 5 produced a robust increase in microglial activation on PN 30 in the cerebral cortex, as well as in cerebellar and cerebrocortical white matter. None of these effects occurred in animals given terbutaline on PN 11 to 14. In behavioral tests, animals treated with terbutaline on PN 2 to 5 showed consistent patterns of hyper-reactivity to novelty and aversive stimuli when assessed in a novel open field, as well as in the acoustic startle response test. Our findings indicate that 2-adrenoceptor overstimulation during an early critical period results in microglial activation associated with innate neuroinflammatory pathways and behavioral abnormalities, similar to those described in autism.

THE COMBINED ROLE AND INTERLEUKIN-6 AS BIOMARKER FOR AUTISM Abstract: \"Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction and repetitive behaviors. Diagnosis of autism is currently phenotype based with no reliable laboratory test available to assist clinicians. It has been shown that dysfunction of serotonin (5-HT) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are involved in autism. The goal of this study was to evaluate the combined role of 5-HT and IL-6 as potential biomarkers for autism. The whole blood concentration of 5-HT and plasma concentration of IL-6 of individuals with autism were significantly elevated compared with the control group, and the concentration of 5-HT and IL-6 had positive correlations with the severity of autism. The results of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that the combination of 5-HT and IL-6 produced the best sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of autism.

The human microbiome, asthma, and allergy Abstract: \"The human microbiome can be defined as the microorganisms that reside within and on our bodies and how they interact with the environment. Recent research suggests that numerous mutually beneficial interactions occur between a human and their microbiome, including those that are essential for good health. Modern microbiological detection techniques have contributed to new knowledge about microorganisms in their human environment. These findings reveal that the microbiomes of the lung and gut contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma and allergy. For example, evidence indicates that the microbiome of the gut regulates the activities of helper T cell subsets (Th1 and Th2) that affect the development of immune tolerance. Moreover, recent studies demonstrate differences between the lung microbiomes of healthy and asthmatic subjects. The hygiene and biodiversity hypotheses explain how exposure to microorganisms is associated with asthma and allergy. Although those living in developed countries are exposed to fewer and less diverse microorganisms compared with the inhabitants of developing countries, they are experiencing an increase in the incidence of asthma and allergies. Detailed analyses of the human microbiome, as are being conducted under the auspices of the Human Microbiome Project initiated in 2007, promise to contribute insights into the mechanisms and factors that cause asthma and allergy that may lead to the development of strategies to prevent and treat these diseases.\" Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4674907/ \"The human microbiome can be defined as the microorganisms that reside within and on our bodies and how they interact with the environment.

The placental interleukin-6 signaling controls fetal brain development and behavior Abstract: \"Epidemiological studies show that maternal immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy is a risk factor for autism. However, mechanisms for how MIA affects brain development and behaviors in offspring remain poorly described. To determine whether placental interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling is required for mediating MIA on the offspring, we generated mice with restricted deletion of the receptor for IL-6 (IL-6Ra) in placental trophoblasts (Cyp19-Cre+ for immunological, pathological and behavioral abnormalities following induction of MIA. We reveal that MIA results in acute inflammatory responses in the fetal brain. Lack of IL-6 signaling in trophoblasts effectively blocks MIA-induced inflammatory responses in the placenta and the fetal brain. Furthermore, behavioral abnormalities and cerebellar neuropathologies observed in MIA control offspring are prevented in Cyp19-Cre+ ;Il6rafl/fl offspring. Our results demonstrate that IL-6 activation in placenta is required for relaying inflammatory signals to the fetal brain and impacting behaviors and neuropathologies relevant to neurodevelopmental disease.\" Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159116304974 \"Epidemiological studies show that maternal immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy is a risk factor for autism.

The proinflammatory effect of C-reactive endothelial cells depends on the Abstract: effects of CRP on endothelial cells are mainly mediated via FcRIIa. This receptor exists in two different allotypes bearing either arginine (R131) or histidine (H131) at the extracellular amino acid position 131 of the mature protein, but only FcRIIa-R131 displays high avidity for CRP. This study investigated the role of the FcRIIa genotype in CRP-stimulated endothelial cells. Materials and Methods: We tested the effects of CRP on expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin, as well as the endothelial release of pro-inflammatory molecules as a function of the FcRIIagenotype (FcRIIa-H/H131, FcRIIa-H/R131, FcRIIa-R/R131) in HUVEC (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells). HUVEC were grouped according to their FcRIIa status by genotyping with an allele specific nested-PCR.

Transgenerational transmission and modification of pathological traits induced by prenatal immune activation Abstract: \"Prenatal exposure to infectious or inflammatory insults is increasingly recognized to contribute to the etiology of psychiatric disorders with neurodevelopmental components, including schizophrenia, autism and bipolar disorder. It remains unknown, however, if such immune-mediated brain anomalies can be transmitted to subsequent generations. Using an established mouse model of prenatal immune activation by the viral mimetic poly(I:C), we show that reduced sociability and increased cued fear expression are similarly present in the first- and second-generation offspring of immune-challenged ancestors. We further demonstrate that sensorimotor gating impairments are confined to the direct descendants of infected mothers, whereas increased behavioral despair emerges as a novel phenotype in the second generation. These transgenerational effects are mediated via the paternal lineage and are stable until the third generation, demonstrating transgenerational non-genetic inheritance of pathological traits following in-utero immune activation. Next-generation sequencing further demonstrated unique and overlapping genomewide transcriptional changes in first- and second-generation offspring of immune-challenged ancestors. These transcriptional effects mirror the transgenerational effects on behavior, showing that prenatal immune activation leads to a transgenerational transmission (presence of similar phenotypes across generations) and modification (presence of distinct phenotypes across generations) of pathological traits. Together, our study demonstrates for, we believe, the first time that prenatal immune activation can negatively affect brain and behavioral functions in multiple generations.
