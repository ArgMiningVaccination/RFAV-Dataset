Originating in China more than 2,500 years ago, acupuncture is currently one of the most thoroughly researched, practiced, and respected forms of complementary medicine available anywhere. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, your overall health is determined by the quality of the Qi (energy) flow through the natural pathways of your body (meridians). Acupuncture uses a variety of techniques, including placing very thin sterile needles into specific points on the body, to stimulate and improve your Qi flow. The World Health Organization has recognized over 200 health conditions that can be treated with acupuncture. Acupuncture treatment can successfully treat or relieve the following conditions: - Women's health issues: PMS, infertility, endometriosis, menstrual irregularities, dysmenorrhea, menopause - Urogenital: interstitial cystitis, incontinence, sexual dysfunction, Gastrointenstinal: IBS, GERD, diarrhea, constipation, gas/bloating - Muskuloskeletal: joint and muscle pain, arthritis, tendinitis, Respiratory: asthma, allergies, bronchitis, sinusitis - Immune system: rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic colds/flus, shingles - Endocrine: thyroid issues, diabetes - Headaches: migraine and tension headaches - Neurological: stroke, neuropathy, dizziness - Mental/Emotional: anxiety, stress, depression, anger, brain fog Common questions about Acupuncture: Do you accept insurance for Acupuncture?

No. You may feel a little prick for a second but if it is painful after that we will adjust it right away so that you can relax. Is Acupuncture safe? How long has Acupuncture been in use? Yes. Acupuncture is a therapy that has been used around the world for thousands of years. In the United States, only sterile, sealed pins are used and they are never reused. How big are Acupuncture needles? When you think of acupuncture, you probably think of needles. Think of very tiny pins instead. These tiny pins (which are about the diameter of a hair) are inserted into particular points on the body to promote a \"qi\" response. \"Qi\" (pronounced chee) is the energy/life force that makes us living, thinking, moving, feeling beings. How long is Acupuncture treatment? The first visit is longer than subsequent visits. First, you would be asked to read and complete some forms. Then, you would be asked questions about your \"chief complaint(s)\", other health issues, medical history, lifestyle, diet, sleep and more. Your tongue and the pulses on both wrists would be examined and some other pertinent assessments may be done depending on your \"chief complaint(s)\". Then, you get to lie down for your acupuncture treatment. Sometimes treatment is done with the patient face down, sometimes face up. What is the price for Acupuncture treatment? initial visit: $165 follow up visit: $90 package of 5 visits: $400 packages and rates are subject to change Cancellation policy: If you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment, we ask that you give us 24 hours + notice. No show or late cancellations will be charged the full appointment price. Testimonials \"Dr. Deneen was able to medically assess my back pain and help me to recover my quality of life. She treated my back pain with acupuncture and some home therapies. The acupuncture was both helpful in reducing the pain and also very relaxing. I even sleep better now. I would much rather have a therapeutic and skilled acupuncture visit from Dr. Deneen, than take medications to mask my pain. I feel safe seeing her for different concerns because of her medical training and her compassionate care. I believe she is one of the few naturopathic doctors in Oklahoma to attend a 4 year medical school and obtain a doctorate in naturopathic medicine. Thank-you Dr. Deneen!\" - Jessica M, Yelp Read Dr. Shana Deneen's patient testimonials [here](https://www.deneennaturalhealth.com/patient-testimonials/)! She looks "}
