What is an Herb? An herb is a plant or part of a plant that is used for its therapeutic, aromatic or culinary properties. The term 'herb' stems from the Latin 'herba', denoting 'green crops'. Herbs can be any plant part: leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, or bark. Each possesses distinct qualities that have been harnessed for centuries in diverse cultures to fortify health and well-being. Herbs exhibit a wide array of properties. Some are nutritive, offering abundant vitamins and minerals, while others are tonic, serving to tone and strengthen specific bodily systems. Certain herbs possess adaptogenic qualities, helping the body adapt to stress, while others, known as alteratives, gradually alter unhealthy conditions in the body. What is Considered an Herb? While the definition of an herb may seem straightforward, the identification of an herb is rather nuanced. An herb is considered so based on its medicinal, aromatic, or culinary value rather than its botanical classification. A plethora of plants fall into the herb category: from tall, woody plants to small, delicate flowers, all with their own unique herbal properties. The basis for herb recognition lies in its utilitarian value, i.e., its application in human health, cuisine, or fragrance. This is corroborated by numerous traditional herbal systems, such as Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine, or Western Herbalism, that highlight the therapeutic value of plants. What are the Benefits of Herbs? Herbs serve myriad purposes in health management: they support immune health, aid digestion, balance hormonal function, and promote skin health, among others. Some herbs act as powerful antioxidants, while others have anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, or anti-viral properties. Furthermore, they can help manage stress, improve cognitive function, and boost overall vitality. What are the Types of Herbs? Herbs can be classified into various types based on their uses: culinary herbs (such as basil and rosemary), medicinal herbs (like echinacea and turmeric), aromatic herbs (including lavender and rose), and ornamental herbs (like hibiscus and chrysanthemum). Another important category is industrial herbs, such as hemp and flax, which have multiple applications in industries including textiles and cosmetics. What are Common Herbs Used as Supplements?
