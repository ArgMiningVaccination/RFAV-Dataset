Use this guide to boost your body's performance in 24 hours.", "sitename": "BetterMe Blog", "date": "2021-09-08", "cleaned_text": "There's no such thing as a one-day magic cure for overeating; that said, it can feel good to hit the reset button now and then. The 1-day detox method provides a little push towards feeling better and making healthier long-term decisions. It's especially important if you take this opportunity to learn about healthy foods that support proper body functions. In the course of the 1-day detox, you'll eliminate all highly processed foods, and focus on nutrient-dense alternatives. You'll also exercise more. Extending this detox to a few days may get you on the path to improving your health and [managing your weight](https://betterme.world/articles/detox-tea-benefits/). What Are The Best Detoxifying Foods? Our bodies eliminate toxins and wastes as a natural process with the help of several organs. As a plus, a diet rich in certain foods can support this process by providing vitamins, [antioxidants](https://betterme.world/articles/7-day-detox-meal-plan/), minerals, essential fatty acids, fiber, and other needed nutrients. Below are some of the best foods to include in your 1-day [detox](https://betterme.world/articles/21-day-detox-diet-menu/): Garlic Garlic is known to have anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-inflammatory properties. One of the healthiest foods you can add to any recipe is garlic because it's not only delicious and versatile; it has powerful cleansing and immune boosting benefits. It contains sulfur compounds like allicin, alliin and others which may increase bile flow in your digestive system which could help remove toxins ( [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7402177/#:~:text=Garlic%20and%20its%20secondary%20metabolites,lowering%20properties%2C%20as%20demonstrated%20in)). Lemons The pectin fiber in lemons binds [toxins](https://betterme.world/articles/7-day-body-cleansing/) to itself so they can be flushed out of the body through urine or stool. The citric acid found in lemons may prevent kidney stones by helping rid the body of calcium oxalate, a crystalline compound that forms when calcium mixes with oxalic acid in your kidneys ( [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6403313/)).

It's also rich in antioxidants, sulfur and vitamin C ( [6](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/ss/slideshow-cabbage-benefits)). It's an extremely versatile vegetable so you can include it in a variety of dishes including soups, salads and stews. Ginger Ginger has been used around the world for centuries for its medicinal benefits. It's believed to stimulate the movement of food through your digestive tract, relieve nausea and vomiting, and give you a boost of energy ( [16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92775/)). Beets Beets are full of fiber and antioxidants that support the [removal of toxins](https://betterme.world/articles/10-day-detox-diet/) from the body. Beets may help improve blood flow and liver function ( [17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4425174/)). Flaxseeds Flaxseeds contain plenty of soluble dietary fiber and omega-3 fatty acids, which provide healthy fats for your heart and brain cells. Flaxseeds regulate bowel movements which help rid your body of toxins as well as excess cholesterol ( [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6567199/)). Arugula This superfood is packed with potassium - an essential mineral for overall health. Additionally, arugula contains vitamin K that helps regulate blood clotting, vitamin A that's known to prevent night blindness, and folate that promotes healthy circulation ( [1](https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/vegetable/health-benefits-of-arugula.html)). Seaweed The sea vegetable is an excellent source of iodine, iron, calcium, fiber, [antioxidants](https://betterme.world/articles/5-day-detox-diet-plan/), folate B-9, and manganese. Other health benefits include low sodium content and potential help with osteoporosis prevention ( [12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22054935/)). Apples Apples are high in soluble fiber pectin which helps you feel full longer because it slows down digestion. Apples contain quercetin - a flavonoid with anti-inflammatory properties believed to protect your body against cancer and cardiovascular diseases ( [4](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/apples/)).

Quinoa This tasty seed is a great alternative to processed carbs and gluten-containing foods. Quinoa is a whole grain which provides energy, regulates blood sugar levels, helps reduce cholesterol levels, and supports healthy weight management as well as cardiovascular health ( [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4957693/)). Oats The beta glucan found in oats has been shown to help support a healthy immune system. Oats also provide soluble fiber that lowers cholesterol levels and enhances satiety - which means you'll be less likely to crave unhealthy snacks between meals ( [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4325078/)). How To Do A 1-Day Detox Cleanse If you're going through with the 1-day [detox plan](https://betterme.world/articles/7-day-detox-diet-plan/), it's important to follow simple steps: Drink Plenty Of Water Drinking enough water is key for the success of any detox diet. It's recommended to drink at least 2 liters of water per day. Because it has zero calories, water is the perfect 1 day detox cleanse drink ( [18](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256)). Drink Green Tea Green tea has been shown in studies to boost metabolism and may help you lose weight in the long term ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2855614/)). Avoid Dairy Products Milk is high in natural sugars (lactose) which may be difficult to digest when consumed on a detox diet ( [10](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/1097512/nutrients)). Instead, choose unsweetened almond or coconut milk.

Choose Low Carb Meals Certain vegetables are low in carbohydrates and fit well with a detox diet. You can use low carb veggies to prepare side dishes or combine them with high protein foods for main dishes. Avoid Added Sugars Added sugars are known for their ability to spike insulin levels which can lead to weight gain, fatigue, mood swings, memory loss, dental issues, heart disease and more ( [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5133084/)). Ditch Processed Foods Processed foods tend to be high in added sugars and saturated fats. They are the main things you want to avoid on a 1 day detox diet. Exercise Regular physical activity is another important part of any healthy lifestyle change - especially this particular detox program since you'll be facilitating the movement of food through your digestive tract. So, focus on getting your body moving. The recommended duration of exercise is 30 minutes per day, but you can exercise for longer depending on your fitness level and goals ( [15](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/rethinking-the-30-minute-workout)). 1-Day Detox Diet Plan There are many benefits that can result from following a detox diet for just one day - it will help provide a boost of energy and other important nutrients to support overall health and well being. This highly recommended 1-day detox plan includes simple steps that anyone can follow: morning, afternoon, evening. Morning Start your 1 day body detox with this morning routine: - Drink Warm Lemon Water Drink a glass of warm water and add the juice of one lemon into it. This may aid with digestion while also providing a dose of vitamin C and potassium ( [2](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/7-reasons-to-start-your-day-with-lemon-water-infographic/)). - Meditate Meditate for 20 minutes or listen to calming music like classical, jazz or meditation music.

Afternoon Choose the right meals to sustain your energy throughout the day. - Eat A Light Lunch Of Brightly Colored Vegetables Your 1-day detox plan should include light meals with high nutrient value because you want good energy levels throughout the day without feeling weighed down or bloated.

Simply taking a walk is perfect. - Snack On Fruits & Nuts Have fruits as a snack in between meals to increase energy levels throughout the day without spiking blood sugar levels. Add some almonds in your snacks bag to feel fuller for longer periods of time ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4500840/#:~:text=This%20study%20indicates%20that%20adding,the%20day%20is%20not%20increased.)). Evening Ending your 1-day detox on the right note is just as important. Here's what you should do: - Enjoy Your Low Calorie Dinner Dinner should be something light and packed with nutrients and fiber to keep you full. Use healthy ingredients to create delicious detox recipes like roasted veggies, lean protein and brown rice. - Exercise After Dinner End the day with a 30 minute exercise session to keep your metabolism working during the night. This will also help you sleep better at night and wake up refreshed in the morning ready for another 1-day detox plan. - Unwind With Some Yoga Or Meditation Learning the basics of yoga or meditation is important for anyone who's looking to make lifestyle changes. It can be difficult in the beginning but it gets easier when you understand the benefits that these practices bring - reduced stress levels, better sleep patterns, reduced pain symptoms, etc. - Have A Calming Night Cap Tea To Help You Sleep It's important to wind down before bed so have a cup of calming herbal tea. Some of the best teas to have before you go to bed include chamomile, passionflower and lavender. The Bottom Line A 1-day detox plan can help you to kick start your healthy lifestyle. It will help you feel energized and lighter while also helping you get rid of toxins, bacteria and other harmful elements that can build up in your body over time.
