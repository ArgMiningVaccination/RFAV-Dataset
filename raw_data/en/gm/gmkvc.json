If you're looking for an amazing physical therapist, look no further. Christine will do wonders. I started seeing Christine months ago after I was diagnosed with \"frozen shoulder.\" I could barely lift my right arm and I was in extreme pain. Previous to seeing Christine, I had cortisone shots (which didn't help) and contemplated surgery. Helga A. Christine made me feel comfortable right away. I had a workplace injury that was interfering with my life. After visiting many doctors I finally found someone that listened to me. Now I'm back at work and back in the game. Thanks, Christine!
