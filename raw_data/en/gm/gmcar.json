Be it any vaccine you get, the take-home message is to get vaccinated, and keep following appropriate norms to maximise immune protection. As with the vaccination itself, there are some do's and don'ts that experts recommend to minimize side effects and keep the vaccine doing its job well.

Even though pain at the injection site is something which is the most typical of vaccination side-effects, massaging the area is also something not routinely suggested with other vaccines. Wondering why? We tell you. [readmore](javascript://) 03/7What causes pain and soreness at the injection site? Post-vaccination, soreness and stiffness experienced at the site of injection are one of the commonly discussed vaccine side-effects. The soreness and redness, which can also come up in the form of extreme 'COVID arm' can last for days and make it difficult for a person to move the upper arm, where the vaccine has been injected. As trivial as it is, soreness and pain at the site are considered to be a localized reaction to the vaccine injection, i.e. the effects which kick in at the exact spot where the jab is given. The reaction that causes arm soreness is an example of how the body first perceives the vaccine to be. When you do get the shot, the body considers it to be an injury, much like a bleed or a cut and sends immune cells to the arm and relaxes the blood vessels. As a part of the process, the immune cells also cause inflammation, which later helps you protect against the same pathogen if you ever encounter it again. This is what experts call a 'reactogenicity' of the vaccine. Some of the arm irritation also comes from the muscle reacting to the small amount of vaccine liquid that was injected into the arm. Apart from soreness, some people can also experience redness, irritation and swelling near the injection site. [readmore](javascript://) 04/7Can massages or rubbing at the site cause irritation? Some localized responses to the vaccines, such as experiencing stiffness or mild swelling at the site of injection can be quite painful and make it difficult to move the arm. While massaging the area or a soothing rub may seem to be very helpful and relieve any inflammation, experts advise against doing so with vaccines. Swiftly rubbing at the particular point of injection, too, may be bad. One of the primary reasons as to why this is advised is because of the manner in which the vaccines are injected, i.e. through an intramuscular route. With intramuscular vaccines (most of the COVID-19 vaccine shots are delivered through this mean right now), rubbing, pinching or massaging the injection site may interfere with the effectiveness of the vaccine. While it may seem to relieve and quench the soreness that follows inoculation, massaging at the point may seldom cause the drug to back up through the subcutaneous tissue present in the deepest layer of your skin, so, as a safety measure, massages or hard rubs are best avoided for the time being. Some also suggest that the vaccines are very delicately pressed into the arm, so such an action could lead to undesirable effects as well. Vaccinators also suggest that rubbing or massaging should be avoided immediately after, or hours after vaccination, when it is expected that the vaccine drug reaches its peak levels and thus avoid counter absorption.

While the recommendation is added as a big safety precaution with COVID-19 vaccines currently, it's also generally recommended with other vaccines routinely used for kids and adults, since most of the vaccine injections are intramuscular ones. [readmore](javascript://) 06/7Can massaging before the vaccine help? If you have recently received the vaccine, or have gotten any vaccine before, you may have noticed clinicians or vaccinators at duty gently massaging the skin before injecting the vaccine into the skin. This is actually a widely followed clinical practice worldwide, which helps soften and relax muscles in the forearm and deliver a vaccine more effectively. However, some studies have also found that such a practice could delay the absorption of certain kinds of vaccines, but may not be clinically significant. [readmore](javascript://) 07/7What can you do to counter the pain? While massaging the area may be a big no-no, soreness and stiffness, by all means, is a difficult vaccination side-effect to handle. It can make your whole arm stiff, leading to a lot of pain and be a symptom that takes the longest to resolve. However, if you do find yourself reeling under terrible pain and stiffness, you can give certain home remedies and natural treatments a try- ice packs, warm compress, soothing baths in Epsom salt water, gently exercising the arm where you have been injected are some of the ways to counter the side-effect and get relief quicker. Certain pain-relieving medications may be considered safe to be had as well. However, do remember their use should be minimal, and best once checked in with the doctor. Experts also do recommend that people who are sensitive to pain or may not like to endure the pain too much (due to events and other commitments) following vaccination get the shot in their non-dominant arm, if possible. Do remember that the symptom and the severity may not always happen, and can differ from person to person.
