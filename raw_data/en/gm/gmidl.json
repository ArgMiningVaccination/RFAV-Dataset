What if I do not have all of the required immunizations by the due date? Can I request an exemption from a vaccine requirement? Yes, if vaccination is not advised for medical reasons or conflicts with your religious belief/strong moral or ethical conviction. You can find and submit a vaccine exemption form in HealthConnect, under Downloadable Forms. If a contagious disease outbreak occurs, the University reserves the right to ask students who have not been vaccinated against that disease to leave campus until the outbreak is over. UNIVERSITY HEALTH INSURANCE REQUIREMENT All full-time students (and some part-time, degree-seeking students, depending on program requirements) who are physically located within the U.S. must have medical insurance that [meets the university's requirements](../student-insurance/index.html#requirements). The university offers the [Carnegie Mellon University Student Health Insurance Plan](../student-insurance/plans.html) (CMU SHIP), as well as vision and dental insurance plans, through Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. The CMU SHIP Highmark BCBS PPO plan is a national plan with participating health care providers across the U.S. Prior to Open Enrollment, a default charge for the medical CMU SHIP annual premium fee is posted on each student's account. This charge is reversed for students who apply for and receive an approved waiver during open enrollment. [CMU Student Health Insurance Plan Details](../student-insurance/plans.html#plan-details) During Your Open Enrollment Period If You Enroll in CMU SHIP The insurance premium fee will remain on your student invoice. If you enroll in the vision or dental plans, or add dependents, the additional charges will appear on your student invoice. [You have the option to pay your insurance premium monthly.](../student-insurance/plans.html#monthly) [You may also add dependents to your plan during certain times.](../student-insurance/plans.html#partialyear) If You Apply for a Waiver If your current insurance meets the [university's requirements](../student-insurance/index.html#requirements), you may [apply for a waiver](../student-insurance/plans.html#waiver). If approved, a credit for the university plan premium fee will appear on your student invoice. If You Take No Action (not recommended) If you do not enroll in SHIP or apply for a waiver, you will be enrolled in CMU SHIP. The insurance premium fee will remain on your student invoice. Waiting for this default-enrollment will delay your insurance enrollment and will delay access to your insurance details, so it is not recommended. If you intend to enroll in the student health insurance plan, please complete the [steps to enroll](../student-insurance/plans.html#enroll-waive) during your Open Enrollment period.
