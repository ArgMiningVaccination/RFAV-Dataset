Surgery or biopsy planned for evaluati on of suspected secondary malignancy 6. Change of M.D. 7. Change of M.D. office address 8. Change of patient name or address 9. Requests from patients that we refrain from contacting them 6II. FREQUENCY OF OFFICE VISITS After returning home, hematopoietic transplant patients should be followed with weekly office visits for one month. The interval time between visits can be extended to 2 weeks for 2 months and then monthly for 6-12 months if the patien t's medical condition remains stable. Vital signs and body weight should be monitored at each clinic visit. Weight and height should be recorded at monthly intervals for assessment of growth a nd development in pediatric patients. Patients who have had an allogeneic hematopoietic st em cell transplant should be monitored for development of chronic graft-ve rsus-host disease (GVHD). Help ful tips on how to assess and score chronic GVHD can be found at http://www. fhcrc.org/ltfu by clicking on \"Information for Physicians\" in the left hand navigation colum n. Then click on the right blue \"GVHD Tips & Forms\" button. Here you will find the Chroni c GVHD Assessment and Scoring form (Appendix D), Range of Motion Assessment form (Appendi x F), Skin Thickness Assessment form/ Rodnan Score for patients with sclerosis or fasciitis (A ppendix E) and other helpful information. More detailed information about chronic GVHD is outlined in Section X. If manifestations of chronic GVHD develop or worsen, please contact the LTFU office (Appendix A). 7III. LABORATORY TESTS A. Complete blood cell counts (CBC), differential and platelet counts should be measured at each office visit. Patients receiving ganciclovir (or ValGANCiclovir), daily Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), Cellcept myelosuppressive medication should have a CBC at weekly intervals or more often when counts are low. B. Liver function tests (LFT's) (alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, LDH and total bilirubin) should be measured at each office visit. Patients receiving immunosuppressive medications or other hepatotoxic drugs such as itraconazole, voriconazole, INH, should have LFT's measured at two-week interv als or more often when abnormalities are present. If drug toxicity suspected, blood levels should be checked if available. C. Renal function tests (serum creatinine, BUN, and magnesium) should be measured at each office visit. Patients receiving cyclospor ine, tacrolimus (formerly known as FK506), amphotericin or other nephrotoxic drugs should have renal function monitored at weekly intervals or more often when abnormalities are present. Dose adjustment may be needed for medications such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, acyclovir, among others. D. Drug levels : Cyclosporine or tacrolimus (FK506) blood le vels should be monito red at least twice monthly until levels remain stable within th e therapeutic range. Sirolimus (rapamycin) should be monitored weekly until levels remain stable within levels maintained no higher than 10 ng/dL). Sirolimus, cyclosporine or tacrolimus (FK506) levels should be checked more frequently when toxicity is suspect ed (i.e., new onset of thrombocytopenia, worsening anemia, abnormal renal function, abnormal LFT's, development of tremors or other neurological symptoms), when blood leve ls are outside the therapeutic range or when manifestations of GVHD is not under control. Itraconazole blood leve ls should be monitored at monthly intervals until levels remain stable within the therapeutic range. Itra conazole levels should be checked more frequently when results are outside the ther apeutic range and when results of LFT's are abnormal. Voriconazole, posaconazole and the oth er azoles should be used with caution during treatment with sirolimus. If treatment with azoles is warranted please contact the LTFU office to discuss sirolimus dose adjustment. E. Fasting lipids profile is recommended periodically due to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and increa sed risk of metabolic syndrome in transplant survivors. In patients receiving sirolimus, tacrolimus or cyclosporine, monthly fasting lipids profile is recommended until acceptable values are achieved, thereafter, monitoring may be decreased to every 3 to 6 months, or mo re often if clinically indicated. 8 F. Thyroid function in blood should be monitored yearly due to increased thyroid disease after transplant. For patients who received radiolabeled iodine antibody therapy, thyroid function should be checked sooner at 3 and 6 mo nths within the first year after transplant, and other times as clinically indicated. G. Blood cultures should be drawn whenever clinically indicated. For high risk patients (i.e., treatment with prednisone at a dose of more than 1 mg/kg/day), weekly surveillance blood cultures may be beneficial. H. CMV monitoring in blood should be instituted for a ll patients who are at risk of CMV disease after transplant. CMV seropositive recipients of non-cord blood allogeneic transplants or CD34 selected autologous transplants s hould have CMV monitored in blood weekly until day 100 after transplant . CMV seropositive cord blood recipients should have CMV monitored twice weekly until day 100 after transplant. CMV seronegative recipients of cord blood should have CMV monitored weekly until day 100 days after transplant. CMV seronegative non-cord bloo d transplant recipients should be monitored weekly until day 60 after transplant. After day 100 posttransplant, CMV mon itoring in blood continued, initially weekly, until 1 year after transplant for allogeneic recipients at risk of late CMV disease which include: CMV-seropositive recipients rece iving steroids for chronic GVHD Patients who were treated for CMV early after transplant. Cord blood transplant recipients The frequency of CMV blood surveillance afte r day 100 posttransplant may be decreased for non-cord transplant recipien ts. In patients receiving treatment with <1mg/kg/day of corticosteroids and who have had three consecu tive negative survei llance tests after day 100, every other weekly CMV monitoring may be sufficient. If treatment with corticosteroid is increased or additiona l systemic immunosuppressive treatment for chronic GVHD is added, weekly CMV monitoring should be resumed as long as clinically indicated. Cord blood transplant recipients have incr eased risk of CMV inf ections and thus are recommended to receive prophylactic treatm ent in addition to CMV blood surveillance (see section IV, D). CMV surveillance tests: CMV monitoring can be performed using CMV DNA by PCR or hybrid capture, pp67 mRNA, or pp65 antigenem ia (culture based assays are for monitoring.) PCR is reco mmended over pp65 antigenemia for patients who have samples shipped to the FHCRC or to other laboratories requiring overnight shipping. 9 I. CMV, EBV and Adenovirus Monitoring A Globulin (ATG) (ATGAM or Thymoglobulin) Un less Specified Differently per Protocol Weekly blood monitoring by PCR for EBV, adenovi rus, and CMV is recommended for at least 6 months after last dose of ATG or absolute lymphocyte count >300 cells/mm3, whichever is later for recipients at increase risk for viral disease which include: Patients receiving ATG for the treatment of steroids refractory GVHD Haplo identical, cord blood or CD 34+ select ed transplants recipients who received ATG as part of conditioning J. Disease Monitoring of Blood and Bone marrow. Bone Marrow: Bone marrow should be evaluated at one year after transplant. Testing should include evaluation of morphology and immunophenotypi ng, cytogenetics and molecular testing as applicable. Subsequent bone marrow ev aluations should be done as clinically indicated such as: The CBC or platelet coun t shows any abnormalities If the most recent marrow evaluation or other testing showed any evidence of persistent malignancy If the patient has a disease for which main tenance treatment would be indicated if disease were discovered afte r a previous evaluation with no evidence of malignant cells. Blood: Patients transplanted for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome- positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (Ph-positive ALL) should have blood tested for BCR/abl transcripts at 6 month intervals for the first 2 years after tran splant and then at yearly intervals. When BCR/ abl transcripts are detected in the blood, a marrow aspirate should be evaluated by cytogenetic tes ting, morphology and molecular testing. If recurrent malignancy occu rs, please contact the LTFU office for consultation for specific treatment and follow- up recommendations (Appendix A). 10IV. INFECTIONS PROPHYLAXIS, PREEM PTIVE THERAPY AND INTRAVENOUS IMMUNOGLOBULIN All transplant recipients have some degree of immunodeficienc y, especially during the first 6-12 months after the transplant. Bacterial, fungal a nd viral infections occur most frequently during this time interval. In the absence of GVHD, most patients ha ve adequate immune reconstitution by one year af ter the transplant. Patients with chronic GVHD remain immunodeficient and have a hi gh risk of infections. A. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) All patients should receive prophylaxis agai nst PCP for at least 6 months after the transplant or until all immunosuppressive medications have been discontinued, whichever occur later. The preferred drug is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole administered according to the following regimen: Adults: 1 double strength tablet p.o. b.i.d. on 2 consecutive days weekly Children > 20 kg: 1 single strength tablet p.o. b.i.d. on 2 consecutive days weekly Children < 20 kg: and 5 mg/kg/day of trim ethoprim component in two divided doses on 2 consecutive days weekly. Patients who are allergic to sulfa should be desensitized whenever possible. If desensitization is not feasible, Dapsone s hould be administered at a dose of 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. daily for adults and 1 mg/kg/day in two divided doses (up to 100 mg/day) for children. Before starting treatment with Dapsone , patients must be tested to rule out G-6- PD deficiency. Other alternative PCP prophylaxis regimens have been less effective in preventing PCP in stem cell transplant re cipients. Please contact the LTFU office (Appendix A) for consultation regarding othe r alternative PCP prophylaxis regimens if needed. B. Varicella-zoster virus All VZV-seropositive patients and those with a history of VZV infection after the transplant should receive prophyl axis with acyclovir or val acyclovir throughout the first year after the transpla nt or until 6 months after syst emic immunosuppressive for control of GVHD ends. Acyclovir should be administered accord ing to the following regimen (assuming adequate renal function): Weight > 40 kg, receiving < 0.5 mg/kg/day of corticosteroids: 800 mg P.O. B.I.D.* Weight < 40kg, receiving < mg/kg/da corticosteroids: 600 mg/ m2 P.O. B.I.D. Alternatively, valacyclovir should be administered according to the following regimen: Weight > 40 kg, receiving > 0.5 mg/kg/day of corticosteroids: 500 mg P.O. B.I.D*. Weight < 40 kg, receiving > 0.5 mg/kg/day patients > kg, lower doses of prophylaxis are sufficient, 800 mg/day of acyclovir or 500 mg/day of valacyclovir. For patients < 40 kg, the dose of acyclovir should be 300 mg/m2 (maximum 400 mg) P.O. B.I.D. 11It is difficult to prevent VZV transmission to susceptible patients because infected individuals are contagious for 24-48 hours before the rash appears. The incubation period of VZV is 10-21 days. Individua ls with VZV (chickenpox or sh ingles) remain contagious until all skin lesions have crusted. All patients exposed to chickenpox or zoster dur ing the first year afte r the transplant or during treatment with immunosuppressive medications should be evaluated. VZV-seronegative patients and thos e not receiving prophylactic acyclovir should be treated with valacyclovir from days 3 to 22 after exposure unless treatment with ganciclovir, foscarnet or cidofovir is being given for another reason. Vala cyclovir should be given at a dose of 1gm p.o. t.i.d. for patients > 40 kg and at a dose of 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. for patients < 40 kg. In adults and children without ad equate oral intake, acyclovir can be administered at a dose of 500mg/m2 IV every 8 hours if rena l function is normal. In seronegative recipients, admini stration of VZIG within 96 ho urs of exposure should also be used, if available, in addition to valcyclovir as outlined above. Patients exposed to chickenpox or zoster during prophylaxis with acyclovir or valacyclovir must be followed closely for the development of VZV infection. Vaccination against VZV should be delayed (See vaccination Section IX for details). C. Encapsulated bacteria Patients with chronic GvHD are highly suscep tible to recurrent bacterial infections, especially with encapsulated as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis. Susceptibility to these organisms may be due to persistent low levels of opsonizing antibodies , low CD4 counts, poor reticuloendothelial function, and long-term use of immunosuppressive therapy, es pecially corticosteroids, with their suppressive effects on ytosis. Long-term chemoprophylaxis is recommended in this setti ng due to unpredictable prot ection provided by vaccination, which is also recommended after transplant. Due to the emergence of penicillin resistance (and the concomitant need for PCP prophylaxis in these patients), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is recommende d first-line dr ug for chemoprophylaxis for infections with encapsulated bacteria. If TMP-SMX is not tolerated, the traditional penicillin-based prophylaxis should be substi tuted for encapsulated bacteria and dapsone also should be prescribed to provide PCP prophylaxis. Other patient groups who should be consider ed for encapsulated organism prophylaxis include those who are: Without GVHD but are receiving glucocor ticoid or other immunosuppressive medications. With persistent or recurrent manifestations of chronic GVHD without ongoing use of immunosuppressive medications Being treated for relapsed or progressive malignancy after transplant Surgically and/or functionally asplenic (see below for more details). Patients who are age> 65 years old post- allogeneic stem cell transplantation. 12 Patients receiving systemic immunosuppr essive therapy for chronic GVHD should receive antibiotic prophylaxis ag ainst infection with encapsulated bacteria for at least 6 months after discontinuati on of all immunosuppressive me dications. Double-strength (DS) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (800m g sulfamethoxazole) given as a single dose daily is adequate for prevention of infection with both PCP and encapsulated bacteria in adults. In patients with sulfa allergies, Peni cillin VK (Pen-Vee-K) should be given for encapsulated bacteria prophylaxis (see Ta ble below). Children < 30 kg who do not tolerate daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) should re ceive Penicillin VK (See Table below). Additional medication is required fo r PCP prophylaxis in patients who receive penicillin instead of daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). (See Section IV.A) Table - Penicillin VK enca psulated bacterial prophylaxis: Adults and Children ( > 60 kg) 750 mg PO BID Adults ( < 60 kg) and Children (40 to 60 kg) 500 mg PO BID Children (20 to 40 kg) 250 mg PO BID Children (< 20 kg) 125 mg PO BID or (50mg/kg/day) For more information, see the Standard Practice Guideline se ction \"Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Encapsulated Bacteria Immunosuppressive Therapy\" Antimicrobial prophylaxis for asplenic patients Patient education is paramount to prevent fata l infections in asplenic patients. Studies have shown that 11% to 50% of postsplen ectomy patients remain unaware of their increased risk for serious infection or the appropriate health precautions that should be undertaken. Important education points include the following: Persons without a functioning spleen are mo re susceptible to certain infections. The risk of infection is life-long, but it is highest in the first y ear or two after the surgery. If unwell (particularly in case of fever associated with rigors ), patients should seek prompt medical attention . Infections can be ra pidly progressive and life- threatening in a matter of hours. The us e of prophylactic or preemptive measures should never be allowed to engende r a false sense of security. Travel-related infections (such as babesiosis and malaria) are particularly important; adherence to antimalarial prophylaxis cannot be overemphasized. All physicians caring for the patient should be informed of the condition, no matter how long after the splenectomy. 13 Antimicrobial regimens are the same as for pr evention of encapsulated bacteria in patients with chronic GVHD, and include daily Tr imethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) or twice-daily Penicillin VK therapy. Penicillin VK provides protection against PCP; thus dapsone or other PCP prophylaxis must be added. The duration of antibiotic prophylaxi s in the asplenic patient afte r transplant is dependent of the presence of chronic GVHD (See Table below). Table - Duration of propylaxis for encapsualt ed organism in asplenic patients according to chronic GVHD HCT recipients with chronic GVHD Until 6 months after immunosuppression d/c'd OR until age 6 OR 2 years after splenectomy (whichever occurs later) All HCT receipients without chronic GVHD (allo, auto, syngenic) 1 year after BMT OR until age 6 OR 2 years after splenectomy (whichever occurs later) Antimicrobial prophylaxis should also be c onsidered for patients AT ANY TIME post- splenectomy during travel to sites where me dical care will not be rapidly accessible. Preemptive therapy for the post-splenectomy patient with fever and rigors Another strategy that has been advocated is the provision of \"standby\" antipneumococcal antibiotics; this strategy may be particularly relevant for patients who are not receiving prophylaxis. Under this strategy, the patient re tains a personal supply of antibiotics to be taken at the first sign of respirat ory illness, fever, or rigors, particularly if there is likely to be a delay in medical evaluation. There is currently no evidence that such early self- treatment will lower the mortality associated wi th post splenectomy sepsis (PSS). In fact, the literature series with the lowest mort ality reported to date emphasized patient education, close follow-up, and prompt physicia n intervention at the earliest sign of even minor infection. Thus, even if patients have their own supply of antibiotics, medical help should be sought immediately, at which time a physician should decide whether to continue antibiotic therapy. Recommended antibiotics and doses that may be useful in preemptive approaches include the following: Adults: Amoxicillin 500 mg tablets; take 4 tablets (2 grams) and report immediately for medical attention Levofloxacin 500 mg tablets; take 1 tablet and report immediately for medical attention Children 20-40 kg: Amoxicillin 250 mg tablets; take 4 tablets (1 gram) and report immediately for medical attention Children < 20 kg: Amoxicillin 50 mg /kg administered as chewable tablets and report immediately for medical attention 14 For penicillin-allergic children, consider Bactrim or other drugs as clinically indicated. Empiric therapy for post-splenectomy seps is (PSS) or other serious infections Early recognition of infection followed by aggr essive intervention is the cornerstone of PSS management. Initial empiric antimicrobial therapy for the splenectomized patient with unexplained fever, rigors, and other systemic symptoms should always include a broad-spectrum antibiotic active against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae , and N. meningitidis such as ceftriaxone. In areas w ith high-level penicillin-resistant pneumococci, vancomycin may be added empirica lly, particularly in cases with suspected or proven meningitis 15D. Cytomegalovirus (Section III H and I for monitoring frequency). 1. Who Should Receive Pre-emptive Therapy for CMV Recipients of non-cord blood allogeneic transplants after day 100, ganciclovir should be given preemptively when CMV DNA is detected in the blood by PCR tests with > 250 IU per mL (equivalent to >1000 numbers of copies per mL), or rising DNA levels (> 5x baseline within one month) or by an antigenemia test with any numbers of positive cells per slide. See Table 1 Recipients of CD34 select ed autologous transplants, ganciclovir should be given preemptively when CMV DNA is dete cted in the blood by PCR tests with > 25 IU per mL (equivalent to >100 numb ers of copies per mL) or by any level of antigenemia test before 100 days post transplant.

CBC and differential must be measured 2- 3 times weekly during treatment with ganciclovir. Daily CBC is mandatory if the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is <1,500/mm3. If ANC <1,000/mm3 before ganciclovir or ValGANC iclovir is started, alternative therapy is foscarnet. Renal function tests must be measured at least weekly. Dose adjustment and other precautions during treatment : STOP ganciclovir or ValGANCicl ovir if the ANC is below 1,000/mm3 and consider foscarnet. AVOID using ganciclovir, ValGANCiclovir and fo scarnet concurrently with acyclovir. Please contact the LTFU office (Appendix A) for consultation. Ganciclovir, ValGANCiclovir and foscarnet MUST be adjusted for renal dysfunction. If quantitative CMV by PCR or antigenemia levels rises for more than 3 weeks on continuous ganciclovir/ValGANCic lovir or foscarnet treatment, antiviral drug resistance should be considered.. Testing for antiviral se nsitivity or molecular screening for UL97 and UL54 mutations should be considered as we ll as changing to other drugs. Clinical management with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Infectious Disease Service may be considered. Please contac t the LTFU office (Appendix A). 182. CMV Prophylaxis After Day 100 in Seropositi ve Cord Blood Transplant Recipients CMV seropositive cord blood transpla nt recipients remain at signifi cantly increased risk for CMV reactivation after day 100 after tran splant. Therefore, antiviral prophylaxis and continued close monitoring after day 100 (see Table 3 below) are recommended for all CMV seropositive cord blood transplant recipients.

Patients with poor or al intake, severe diarrhea/gut GVHD are NOT good candidates for ValGANCiclovir and should receive IV ganciclovir daily. * Valacyclovir tablets should NOT be crushed. Oral acycl ovir suspension has poor bioavailability and is not a preferred choice. 19Table 4: CMV Prophylaxis and Monitoring after Day 100 for CMV-seropositive Cord Blood Recipients without Prior Posttransplant CMV Reactivation DOSING PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE MONITORING BLOOD Able to tolerate PO intake Unable to tolerate PO intake Adult or Pediatric 50 kg Valacyclovir* 2 grams PO TID Acyclovir 500 mg/m2 IV Q 8 hr Ganciclovir 5 mg/kg Q DAY Weekly: CMV by PCR Creatinine and CBC with Differential Pediatric 40 to <50 kg Valacyclovir* 2 grams PO TID Pediatric 30 to <40 kg Valacyclovir* 1 gram PO TID Pediatric 20 to < 30 kg Valacyclovir* 1 gram PO TID Pediatric 15 to < 20 kg Acyclovir 600 mg/m2 PO QID Pediatric 10 to < 15 kg Acyclovir 600 mg/m2 PO QID * Oral Valacyclovir is the preferred agent and is av ailable in tablets or compounded liquid formulation for children. Crushing tablets is NOT recommended. If patients cannot tolerate oral tablets or liquid formulation, they should receive IV Acyclovir (adjusted to ideal body weight). Oral acyclovir suspension has poor bioavailability, thus not a preferred choice. Dose adjustment and other precautions during treatment : STOP ganciclovir or ValGANCicl ovir if the ANC is below 1,000/mm3 and consider acyclovir, valacyclovir or foscarne t, as clinically indicated. AVOID using ganciclovir, ValGANCiclovir, foscarnet and valacyclovir concurrently with acyclovir. Please contact the LT FU office (Appendix A) for consultation. Ganciclovir, foscarnet, Val GANCiclovir, valacyclovir and acyclovir MUST be adjusted for renal dysfunction. E. Fungal organisms The current standard practice for antifungal pr ophylaxis is to administer fluconazole (400 mg/day) until day 75 after an allogeneic or CD34 selected autologous transplant or until engraftment and resolution of mucositis after an unselected autologous transplant. This strategy has been shown to reduce the incidence of candi demia and candidiasis-related mortality. Fluconazole does not prevent infection Aspergillus and other mold species. 20F. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVI G) replacement and adjunctive therapy This section addresses the us e of IVIG after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) when given after day 100 to 1 year. Reported IVIG studies are liste d in the end of the LTFU general guidelines [1-8]. For information regarding IVIG administration before100 days after transplant see Sta ndard Practice Committee guidelines. 1. Indication for prophylactic administrati on of IVIG after 100 days following HCT: Allogeneic patients transplanted for my eloma, low grade lymphoma or CLL and those with chronic GVHD with persis tent severe hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG levels below 400 mg/dL). Patients transplanted for prim ary immunodeficiency disease. 2. Dosing and administration of prophylact ic IVIG after 100 days following HCT: a. For allogeneic patients transplanted for myeloma, low grade lymphoma or CLL and those with chronic GVHD with severe hypogammaglobulinemia: Administer IVIG 400 mg/kg at monthly intervals to maintain serum IgG levels above 400 mg/dL for 10 months after transplant. Beyond one year after HCT, a 6 month trial of monthly prophylactic IVIG may be beneficial for patients with recurrent sinopulmonary infections and persistent hypogammaglobulinemia, especially in those with chronic GVHD. b. For primary immune deficiency disease (PID): level 1 (mg/dL) IVIG 600 - 1000 Begin at 200 mg/kg/every 2 weeks and wean to 400 mg/kg/every 4 weeks if troughs remain satisfactory < 600 300 mg/kg/every 2weeks up to 500 mg/kg every week 2 >1000 400 mg/kg/every 4 weeks until B cell function fully restored 1 When low levels are attributable to increased losses (e.g. chronic diarrhea) both IVIG dose and frequency should be increased. 2 For pediatric patients the maximum dose of IVIG is 40 grams. For pediatric patients whose central line is only being used for IVIG prophylaxis, transition to subcutane ous human immunoglobulin preparation (Hizentra ) may be considered under the approval and guidance of Pediatric Immunology Service. c. IVIG should be held two months before the annual posttrans plant evaluation to assess immune reconstitu tion. (e.g. serum immunoglobulins levels and other immunological panel). d. Select immunoglobulin product according to precautions to decrease adverse effects as applicable (see cautionary note below). 213. IVIG for treatment of CMV pneumonia: There is no convincing efficacy data to add standard IVIG to antiviral therapy for CMV pneumonia after HCT. The overall benefit of CMV IgG combined with antiviral for treatment of CMV pneumonia has been reported by some but not all investigators. Due to high mortality asso ciated with CMV pneumonia, some experts recommends antiviral therapy combine with CMV IgG as follows: CMV-IVIG may be administ ered at 150mg/kg every ot her day for 2 weeks (7 doses) followed by weekly administration for 4 additional weeks in combination with anti-CMV medication. When high titer CMV-IVIG product (CytoGam) is not available, some experts has recommended using standard IVIG at 500mg/kg given at the same schedule as described above for CMV IgG. 4. Premedications before IVIG administration: Given the high incidence of side effects of IVIG infusion (i.e., fever, chills, nausea, emesis, headache, myalgias, rash a nd hypotension diphenhydramine) is recommended. 5. Contraindication for IVIG: 1. Antibodies to IgA present 2. Anaphylaxis or severe prior reaction to immunoglobulin or serum therapy. 6. Cautionary note about IVIG: IgA deficiency: IgA deficiency is consider ed a contraindication for IVIG use because patients may develop IgE antibodies to IgA wh ich increases their risk of anaphylaxis if exposed to a product containing significan t quantities of IgA. IVIG formulation products with the lowest IgA content availa ble should be given to patients known to be deficient in IgA who require IVIG and who do not have detect able antibodies to IgA. All patients with absent pre-transplant serum IgA levels should be evaluated for the presence of anti-IgA antibodies. (see table below) Renal insufficiency (creatinine clearan ce less than 60 ml/min): Sucrose-free containing IVIG products should ONLY be used in the setting of renal insufficiency. (see table below) 22 IVIG Preparations Preparation Sugar Content FEVER OF UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY Fever should be considered a sign of infection until proven otherwise. The following evaluation should be instituted promptly in all patients with fever. 1. Complete physical examination includi ng the perineal a nd rectal area. 2. Blood culture 3. Urine culture 4. Cultures from any site suspicious for infection 5. Chest X-ray. CT of the chest should be obtai ned if respiratory symptoms are present even if the chest x-ray is negative. 6. Sinus CT scan should be obtained if re spiratory symptoms are present. Empiric treatment with antibiotics may be indi cated after cultures ha ve been obtained. Sudden, overwhelming sepsis syndrome with Pneumococcu s or other encapsulated organisms can occur, especially in patient s who have poor compliance with antibiotic prophylaxis. Organisms should be tested for antibiotic susceptibility. Please contact the LTFU office (Appendix A) for cons ultation or assistance regarding specific treatment and other evaluation as needed. 24VI. EVALUATION OF RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS AND LUNG INFILTRATES If the patient develops respiratory problems that do not resolve afte r initial diagnostic evaluation and treatment, we urge you to cont act the LTFU office (Appendix A) to discuss further evaluation and management. A. Diagnostic Evaluation 1. Chest x-ray PA and lateral 2. Lung CT scan if respiratory symptoms persist 3. Sinus CT scan if symptomatic or suspected sinus infection 4. Blood culture (always) 5. Nasopharynx culture for pertus sis if clinical ly indicated 6. Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) is recomm ended for patients with pulmonary symptoms or pulmonary infiltrates to rule out infectious complication. 7. Transbronchial or thoracoscopic biopsy if BAL is negativ e with persistent pulmonary infiltrates B. Tests Recommended for BAL and Transbronchial Biopsy Specimens See algorithm on the end of this section for overview. 1. Bacterial, fungal, mycobacter ial, and Legionella cultures 2. Stains specific for viral inclusions an d general morphology to rule out malignancy Galactomannan Enzyme Immunoassay (GM EIA) (fluid only) or aspergillus by PCR 5. CMV shell vial test 6. for adenovirus) 8. DFA fluorescent antibody) for Legionella or P CR for Legionella 9. If clinically indicated, PCR or IHC for EBV. C. Evaluation of Pulmonary Nodules or Persis tent Infiltrates with a Negative BAL 1. Thoracoscopic biopsy or open lung biopsy is recommended for pa tients with nodular infiltrates to rule out fungal, malignancy, bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) or other processes. T horacoscopic lung biopsy generally causes less morbidity than open lung biopsy. Fresh tissue should be submitted for microbiologic and pathologic evaluation. 2. Tests recommended for lung tissue a) Fresh samples should be obtained for DF A and culture or PCR for Legionella. b) Imprints of the frozen section and perman ent section should be made and evaluated for morphology and assessment of viral inclusions and possible malignancy by using Papanicolaou, Wright-Giemsa, hema toxylin and eosin stains. for Pneumocystis, f ungi, mycobacteria, Legionella and other silver Kinyoun AFB, modified Gimenez and tissue Gram stains. Warthin-Starry st ain should be done if needed. When available, immunohistochemistry stai ning and in situ hybridization are recommended for detection of viral infection. c) Samples should be submitted for microbi ologic evaluation to detect fungi, mycobacteria, and other bacterial organisms. d) Aspergillus by PCR e) Samples should be submitted for viral cultures, in addition: 25-DFA staining for adenovirus) -Shell vial CMV, VZV, HSV, EBV, HHV-6, depending on the suspicion. 26Tests Recommended for Bronchoal veolar Lavage Fluid or Lung Biopsy ALWAYS: fungal cultures Gram Stains, KOH Histology / cytology (H & E , silver RECOMMENDED: Legionella (culture & DFA or PCR) AFB (culture & by PCR Aspergillus Galactomannan Enzyme Immunoassay (GM EIA) (fluid only) Keep material in the refri gerator / freezer until a defi nitive diagnosis is made.

During respiratory season: RSV and others respiratory virus (for example influenzae A & B, parainfluenzae, adenovirus) by PCR If VZV suspected If HSV is suspected: If patient or donor are CMV seropositive: Shell vial cultures for CMV If EBV by PCR or immuno-histo- chemistry, IHC SPECIFIC SITUATIONS 27 VII. EVALUATION OF DIARRHEA AND OTHER GI COMPLICATIONS If the patient develops diarrhea or other gast rointestinal complications that do not resolve after initial diagnostic evaluati on and treatment (see al gorithm on the end of this section), we urge you to contact the LTFU office (Appendix A) to discuss further evaluation and management. A. Diagnostic Evaluation and Initial Management 1. Diarrhea caused by oral magnesium suppl ementation should be ruled out. If necessary, patients should receiv e IV replacement of magnesium. 2. The clinical evaluation of diarrhea depends on its duration and volume, the presence of blood, and the occurrence of fever and other constitutional symptoms. Normal stool volume is <200 ml/day. Volumes >1000 ml/day indicate effect, enteric virus, giardiasis or enteric pathogen, GVHD or CMV enteritis. A more directed approach can be taken if there is a history of foreign tr avel or history of exposure to children from day-care setting. An algorithm for evaluation of diarrhea is summarized on the following page. 3. Patients should remain NPO for 24-48 hours an d IV fluids should be given to prevent volume depletion. Special diets are recommende d for patients with diarrhea caused by GVHD (Section XX). 4. Immunosuppressive medications should be given IV if th e volume of diarrhea exceeds 1.5 liter/day in adults of if diarrhea persists for more than 3 days. Contact the LTFU office (Appendix A) for IV doses of immunosuppressive medications. 5. Monitor creatinine closely, and check the cy closporine or tacrolimus (FK506) level weekly. 6. Avoid treatment with anti-diarrhea agen ts containing atropine-like drugs (e.g. Loperimide). 7. If the diarrhea does not resolve with these measur es or recurs after th e patient resumes oral medications, a search for enteric pathogens in cluding, for example, norovirus, for children, rotavirus a nd endoscopy with biopsies is recommend. Adequate platelet count and coagulation pa rameters should exist to do biopsy safely. B. Procedures for Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Biopsies 1. Maintain platelet counts >50,000 before a nd for 3 - 4 days af ter the procedure. 2. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy should be carried out with multiple biopsies. Biopsy of any erosion or ulcerations is indicate d. If there are no macroscopic abnormalities found, we suggest 6-8 biopsies of the gastric antrum. To minimize the risk of bleeding, avoid biopsies of the duodenum unless this is the only site of abnormalities. 3. When diarrhea is the major GI symptom in a patient without othe r manifestations of GVHD, either upper endoscopy or colonosc opy m ay be indicated to rule out CMV infection or occult GVHD. All infections other than CMV can be identified from stool samples. Biopsies obtained from the gastric antrum are usually sufficient to diagnose GVHD, even in cases where the major symptom is diarrhea. 4. Biopsies samples (n = 4) should be placed in fresh buffered formalin. 5. Fresh biopsy samples (gastric, rectal or co lon) should be placed in viral transport medium and sent to a virology lab to perf orm rapid testing (shell vial) for CMV and Varicella zoster as well as HSV if there ar e esophageal lesions. The last stomach sample should be placed in CLO media to test for H. Pylori. 286. Please send slides and biopsy blocks to the address below if you wish our pathologists to review the specimen. Because GVHD may be found in one but not all sites, it is important to send as many slides or blocks as possible. 7. Please label the material with the patien t's name, the date obtained and sites. 8.

TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC INFECTIONS Please contact the LTFU office (Appendix A) to discuss the most appropriate therapy in patients developing any of the in fections described below. A. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Late onset CMV infections have become an increasingly difficult problem for patients who have had a hematopoietic stem cell transp lant. Reconstitution of the T cells that respond to CMV is slow and may be delaye d by prophylactic use of ganciclovir during the first 3 months after the tr ansplant. Patients at risk of CMV infection should be monitored closely and should receive prophylac tic antiviral treatment to prevent CMV disease. Note that some patients pr esent with nausea a nd vomiting as initial manifestations of CMV infection, in the absence of CMV antigenemia. Prophylactic treatment is recommended when CMV is de in blood or plasma by antigenemia assay (CMV pp65) or by PCR, in patients at risk as outlined in Secti on IV D. To obtain recommendations for treatment of patie nts who develop CMV pneumonia or other diseases caused by this virus, we urge you to contact the LTFU office (Appendix A). B. Varicella in fection occurs in 40-50% of patients during the first year after the transplant (peak risk 2-8 months) when prophylactic acyclovir is not given. In approximately 10% of patients, VZV infecti on presents with abdominal distension or pain in the abdomen or back, often accomp anied by increased serum ALT, before the development of any skin lesions. Visceral VZV is frequently fatal if tr eatment is delayed. If prodromal zoster or documented VZV inf ection occurs during the first year after the transplant or at any time during continued treatment with immunosuppressive medications, parenteral treatment should be st arted immediately with high dose acyclovir, and blood should be sent to confir m the diagnosis by a VZV PCR test. Patients should be treated according to the following recommendations. 1. Fluids should be administered at twice th e daily maintenance le vel during treatment with high dose acyclovir. 2. Prophylactic treatment with acyclovir should be resume d after high-dose treatment has been completed. 3. Renal function tests must be followed closely during treatment with high dose acyclovir. 4. Doses of acyclovir must be decreased in patients with renal impairment. Disseminated zoster: IV acyclovir 500 mg/m2 administered as a one hour IV infusion q 8 hr until there is no evidence of new lesions for 72 hours. Tr eatment may then be continued with valacyclovir 1 gm t.i.d. p.o. for patients > 40 kg and 500 mg t.i.d. p.o. for patients < 40 kg to complete the course of treatment (generally 10-14 days). Localized zoster: IV acyclovir 500 mg/m2 administered as a one hour IV infusion q 8 hr for three doses, then change to oral valacyclovir as outlined above to complete the course of treatment. Dose adjustment is necessary in pa tients with impaired renal function. 31C. Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia (PCP) All patients should receive trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis (Section IV A). Patients who do not comply with the reco mmended prophylactic re gimen may develop PCP and will require appropriate treatment. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should be given at a dose of 15-20 mg/ kg/day of the trimethoprim com ponent in divided every 6-8 hr for days trea 32IX. o, measles, mumps, rubella, and encapsulated organisms) decline between 1 and 4 y ears after allogeneic or autologous HCT if the recipient is not revaccinated. The clinical relevance of reduced an tibody titers to thes e diseases is not readily apparent because only a limited number of vaccine-preventable diseases have been reported among HCT recipients. No netheless, vaccine-preventable diseases continue to pose risks to the population. Additiona lly, there is evidence that infections with encapsulated organisms, measles, varicella and influenzae can pose risk to HCT recipients. Therefore, HCT recipients should be routinely vaccinated after HC T so that they can experience immunity to the same vaccine-preventable diseases as others. \"Guidelines for Preventing Infectious Complications Among Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients: A Global Perspective\" have recently been updated by organi zations that include: American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT), Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMT R), National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP), the European Group of Blood and Marrow Transplant ation (EBMT), Infectious Diseases Society or America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The vaccination recommendations shown in the following schema were formulated based on review of the approaches taken by these organizations. The earlie st time to start vaccina tions is 6 months post transplant in Non-Primary Imm une Deficiency patients and shoul d be considered in conjunction with factors that significantly delay immune reconstitution. See tables for recommendation for vaccina tions for adult and pediatric patients: IX.A1 Adult Vaccination Schema- Inactivated Vaccines: If eligible to begin vaccination before 12 months IX.A2 Adult Vaccination Schema- Inactivated Va ccines: If patient not vaccinated before 12 months IX.A3 - Adult Vaccination Schema- Live Vaccines IX.P1 Pediatric Vaccination Sc hema: If eligible to begin vaccination before 12 months IX.P2 Pediatric Vaccination Schema: If pa tient not vaccinated before 12 months 33Table IX.A1: Adult Vaccination Schema- Inactivated Vaccines: If eligible to be gin vaccination before 12 months 1, 6 (Sept -March) Flu H.

Post-vaccination testing for antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen is recommended 1-2 months after the 3rd dose to ensure protection. Patients who do not respond to the primary vaccine series should receive a second 3 dose series. High dose (40mcg/dose) hepatitis B vaccination is recommended in immunocom promised or hemodi alysis patients. 6 For inactivated \"dead\" virus vaccine, vaccination s hould be at least 2 months post last dose of IVIG. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Amer ican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that vaccine providers should strongly consider observing patients for 15 minutes after they are vaccinated. If syncope develops, patients should be observed until the symptoms resolve. 34 Table IX.A2: Adult Vaccination Schema -Inactivated Vaccines : If patient not vaccinated before 12 months 1, 6 Vaccine >12m >14m >16m (Sept -March) Flu H.

Post-vaccination testing for an tibody to hepatitis B surface antigen is reco mmended 1-2 months after the 3rd dose to ensure protection. Patients who do not respond to the primary vaccine seri es should receive a second 3 dose series. 7 2-1-5 Rule = Not until 2 years post HCT and > 1 year off all immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and at least 5 m onths since last dose of IVIG/V ZIG or most recent plasma transfusion 8 For live virus vaccine, vaccina tion should be at least 5 months post last dose of IVIG. For inactivated \"dead\" virus vaccine, vaccination should be at least 2 months pos t last dose of IVIG Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Amer ican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that vaccine providers should strongly consider observing patients for 15 minutes after they are vaccinated. If syncope develops, patients should be observed until the symptoms resolve. 38 Please keep records of all vacc inations (dates and types of all vaccines) given to the patient after the transplant and re port any toxicity to the LTFU. Posttransplant Vaccination of Primary Immunodeficiency Disorders (PID): From a practical standpoint, pa tients with primary immunodefici ency disorders (PID) are not candidates for the Standard Prac tice early vaccination policy that begins at 6 months after transplant. Bacteriophage testing will be offered to all PID patients when they have discontinued all immunosuppressive therapy with few exceptions (e.g. history of anti-CD20 antibody therapy or PID with poor donor B cell engraftment) but will not be the main arbiter to determine when a PID patient is eligible to receive vaccines. PID patients will first be considered as candidate s for vaccination at 1 year after transplant if they satisfy the following criteria: A. It is reasonable to attempt a 3 month trial off IVIG replacement therapy based on a negative history of patient in fections in the past 6 months and B. The prevalence of community infections with influenza, RS V, metapneumovirus, or parainfluenza during the planne d trial off IVIG therapy is low and C. All of the following laboratory criteria: Criteria Comment 1. Trough IgG > 600 mg/dL on standard IVIG dosing Suggests numeric IgG reconstitution 2. Detectable serum IgA (> 6 mg/dL) A detectable IgA level indicates potential ability to \"class switch\" 3. Donora B cell count > 200 per microliter Arbitrarily set at 1-log higher than our standard practice for those transplanted for malignancy 4. Donorb CD4 T cell count > 200 per microliter Same as our standard practice for those transplanted for malignancy a as determined by donor B cell chimerism times total absolute B cell count b as determined by donor CD4 cell chimerism times total absolute CD4 T cell count Standard Protocol for Re-vaccination wi th Killed Vaccines after HCT for PID: 1. If patient satisfies criteria A a nd B above, then obtain results of trough IgG, IgA and IgM levels, CD19 or CD20 B cell count per microliter and B cell chimerism (% donor), CD4 T cell count per microliter. If patient visit is not timed with the expected trough following last dose of IVIG, then defe r quantitative immunoglobulin testing until trough levels are expected. 2. If the results of (1) indicate that the patient now satisfies criteria A, B and C then: o Plan to hold IVIG therapy for the next 12 weeks o Week 0 : Give one dose each of: Prevnar, HiB, DTaP (or Tdap) and HBV (combination vaccines are prefer red to limit the number of shots). o Wks 6-8 : Repeat the series given at Week 0 o Week 12 : Check antibody respons e titers including : Hib, 23-pneumococcal serotypes, tetanus toxoid, and hepatitis B surface antibody 39 3. Pediatric LTFU Attendings will decide whether patient's responses to tetanus, HiB and Prevnar are sufficient for the patient to remain off immunoglobulin therapy and to proceed with vaccination against pneumococcu s, hemophilus influenza Type B, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and hepati tis B, as well as to begin a standard series of conjugated meningococcal, hepatitis A and inactivated po lio vaccines. Alternatively, if vaccine response is inadequate then patient will resu me IVIG therapy and further vaccination will be deferred. Standard Protocol for Re-vaccination wi th Live Vaccines after HCT for PID: 1. If patient has responded adequately to killed vaccines the patient may be considered for the live attenuated measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, and the varicella-zoster vaccine (in VZV seronegative patients only) assuming the following additional criteria are met: a. At least 2 years posttransplant b. At least 1 year off all syst emic immunosuppressive therapy c. At least 5 months after last dose of gammaglobulin therapy Posttranslant Vaccination of All Other Patients (NON-PID) Clinically relevant, 2-4 fold rises in specifi c antibody levels, or a rise from undetectable to a level considered protective, require at lease partial reconstitution of adaptive (T and B cell) immunity. Therefore, f actors that might influence a de cision to delay a series of vaccinations include: Table IX.1 Delay of T cell recovery Delay of B cell recovery CD4 T cells < 200/ L CD19 or CD20 B cells < 20/ L Active GVHD Anti-CD20 antibody < 6 months IVIG therapy < 2 months ago Moderate to severe GVHD Receiving chemotherapy or biological therapeutic agents Receiving chemotherapy or biological therapeutic agents General Recommendations: Vaccination for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae is recommended for all transplant recipients, but does not supplant chemoprophylaxis due to variable serologic responses. Inactivated vaccine inje ctions should be used for family members who need vaccinations against polio. Isolation is necessary if live (oral) polio vaccine is administered to family members or other persons in close contact with the patient during the first year after the transplant or at any time during treatment with immunosuppressive medications. The virus can be shed for 8 to 12 weeks after vaccination. Influenzae vaccination: Live attenuated infl uenzae vaccine is not recommended. 40 Smallpox vaccine is comprised of live vaccinia virus. Smallpox vaccination is contraindicated in HSCT recipients because it may result in de velopment of generalized vaccinia or inadvertent inoculation at other si tes such as the face, eyelid, nose, mouth, genitalia, and rectum. Smallpox vaccine should not be administered to any family members or other persons who share living space with the patient during the first year after transplant and beyond one year if the patient contin ues on treatment with immunosuppressive medications. If smallpox vaccination is admini stered to these close contacts, then these individuals should be preven ted from having close contact with the immunocompromised HSCT recipient. See the CDC website for further detailed information http://www.bt.cdc.gov . Other live vaccines (i.e., BCG, or al polio, yellow fever, typhoid) should not be administered in patients with active manifest ation of GVHD or receiv ing immunosuppressive therapy. Anthrax vaccine is an inactivated, cell-fr ee filtrate vaccine (e .g., no dead or live bacteria in the preparation). Currently, anthrax vaccina tion is not routinely recommended for anyone except certain high-risk groups such as persons working directly with the organism in the laboratory or certain military personnel. Recommendations for HSCT recipients would be the same as for other at-risk individuals. Detailed information is available at the CDC website http://www.bt.cdc.gov . 41X. CHRONIC GRAFT-VERSUS-H OST DISEASE (GVHD) a major complication of alloge neic hematopoietic cell transplantation. The incidence of chronic GVHD varies between 20 to 85% and depends on many factors such as the transplant source (blood stem cell vs. marrow vs. umbilical cord), donor type and other characteristics (previous pregna nt female versus male donor), age (older vs. younger) and others factors. Chronic GVHD syndrome has features resembling autoimmune and other immunologic disorders such as scleroderma, Sjogren's syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, syndrome, bronchiolitis obliterans, immune cytopenias, and chronic imm unodeficiency. Symptoms usually present within three years after allogeneic HC T and are often preceded by a history of acute GVHD. Approximately 50% of patients who deve lop chronic GVHD are di agnosed by 6 months after transplant. Features of chronic GVHD can begi n before day 100 after the transp lant and manifestations that are typical or \"classical\" of acute GVHD can de velop or persist long after day 100. Moreover, chronic and acute GVHD features may present simultaneously [1,2]. For this reason, the differential diagnosis between acute and chroni c GVHD cannot be made solely a ccording to the time interval from transplant [3,4]. Criteria to categorize acute and chronic GVHD by the chronic GVHD NIH consensus working group is outlined in Table 1 [4]. Helpful tips on how to assess and score chronic GVHD can be found at http://www.fhcrc.org/ltfu by clicking on \" Information for Physicians \" in the left hand navigation column. Then click on the right blue \" GVHD Tips & Forms \" button. Here you will find the Chronic GVHD Assessment and Sc oring form (Appendix D), Range of Motion Assessment form (Appendix F), Skin Thickness A ssessment form/ Rodnan Score for patients with sclerosis or fasciitis (Appendix E) and other helpful information. A. Table 1. Categories of acute and chronic GVHD [4] Category Time of symptoms after HCT or DLI Presence of Acute GVHD Features Presence of Chronic GVHD Features* Acute GVHD Classic acute GVHD 100 days Yes No Persistent, recurrent or late onset acute GVHD > 100 days Yes No Chronic GVHD Classic chronic GVHD No time limit No Yes Overlap syndrome No time limit Yes Yes DLI (donor lymphocyte infusion) * See Table 2 below 42 B.

Diagnosis of chronic GVHD requires biopsy or radiolog y confirmation (or Ophthalmology exam for eyes). Schirmer's test with a mean value < 5 mm (average of both eyes) at 5 minutes, or values of 6-10 mm in patients who have sicca symptoms, or keratitis detected by slit lamp examination are used for the diagnosis of chronic GVHD or the eyes (again other causes of dry eyes need to be ruled out (e.g., drug effect). Abbreviations: GVHD (graft versus host purpura). - Signs and Symptoms of chronic GVHD[4] 44C. How to diagnosis chronic GVHD Signs and symptoms of chronic GVHD have been reviewed and reported by the NIH consensus Working Group to standardize criteria for diagno sis and classification of chronic GVHD for the purpose of clinical trials (Table 2) [4]. The diagnosis of chronic GVHD has no time limit and requires the presence of at least one diagnostic clinical sign of chronic GVHD (e.g. poikiloderma or esophageal web) or the presence of at least one distinctive manifestation (e.g. keratoconjunctivitis sicca) confirme d by pertinent biopsy or other re levant tests in the same or another organ (Table 2) The criteria for the diagnos is of chronic GVHD include: i. Distinction from acute GVHD (Table 1) ii. Presence of at least one diagnostic clinical manifesta tion OR at least one distinct manifestation confirmed by pertinent biopsy or other relevant tests (Table 2) iii. Exclusion of other possible diagnosis for the clinical manifestation (e.g., infection, drug effect, others) D. How to score each organ/site severity with chronic GVHD (Appendix D) The new scoring system (0-3) has been developed to describe the severity of chronic GVHD for each organ or site taking functional impact into account [4]. Appendix D is a modified chronic GVHD Scoring and Assessment form to help physicians to evaluate their patients with chronic GVHD. Appendix E is another tool developed to help physicians to assess skin thickness in patients with sclerotic features or fasciitis related to chronic GVHD. E. How to assess overall severity of chronic GVHD - Global Assessment Manifestations of chronic GVHD may be restricted to a single organ or tissue or may be widespread. Historically, chroni c GVHD was classified as \"limited\" or \"extensive\" based on a small cohort patients reported more than two decades ago [5]. Because of inadequacies of the original classification (e.g., difficu lty to apply the historical criteri a in patients transplanted with newer HCT approaches and progr ess in our understanding of chronic GVHD), overtime, this widely adopted chronic GVHD classifi cation has proved to have limitation [3,4]. The new global assessment of chronic GVHD severity (mild, moderate or severe) is based on numbers of organs/sites involved and the de gree of involvement in affected organs/sites (Table 3) [4]. This new global assessment of chronic GVHD severity has been developed to replace the historical \"extensive/limited\" classification. Table 3. Global assessment of chronic GVHD severity Global severity No. organs/site s affected Maximum score in all affected organ/site* Mild One or two (except lungs) 1 Moderate Three or more or 1 One or more 2 Severe Any 3 * See Appendix D. A lung score of 1 is considered moderate. A lung score of 2 or greater is considered severe. 45F. Other laboratory testing and diagnostic indicators used in chronic GVHD Biopsy (Skin, lip and other tissues). Histol ogical confirmation is necessary in the absence of diagnostic clinical features or distinctive features confirmed by other pertinent test (Table 2). Nonetheless, di agnostic histological features of chronic GVHD are uncommon. Lung New obstructve lung defect often repr esent lung involvement if: infectious process, asthma or recurrent aspi ration from the sinuses or from gastroesophageal reflux have been ruled out (Table 2 and Appendix D). In the absence of chronic GVHD in any other organ, the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) requires negative micr obiological tests fr om bronchoalveolar lavage, evidence of air trapping by high resolution end-expiratory and end- inspiratory CAT scan of the lungs, or confirmation by thoracoscopic biopsy. Pulmonary scoring (Appendix D) should be performed using both the symptom and pulmonary function testing (PFT) scale whenever possible. When discrepancy exists between pulmonary sy mptom or PFT scores the higher value should be used for final scoring. Scoring using the Lung Function Score (LFS) is preferred, but if DLCO (carbon m onoxide diffusion capacity corrected for hemoglobin) is not available, grading using FEV1 (forced expiratory volume) should be used. The LFS is a global assessment of lung function after the diagnosis of bronchiolit is obliterans has already been established. 28 The percent predicted FEV1 and DLCO (adjusted for hematocrit but not alveolar volume) should be converted to a numeric score as follows: > 80% = 1; The LFS = FEV1 score + DLCO score, with a possible range of 2-12. Esophagus Esophageal web formation, stricture or dysmotility demonstrated by barium swallow, endoscopy or manometry. Muscle Elevated CPK or al dolase, EMG findings consistent with myositis with biopsy revealing no etiologica autoantibodies in some cases. G. Monitoring and other chronic GVHD information Karnofsky or Lansky Clinical Performance scor es <60%, >15% weight loss, and recurrent infections are usually signs of poorly controlled chronic GVHD . Chronic GVHD can lead to debilitating consequences, e.g., jo int contractures, loss of sight, end-stage lung disease, or mortality resulting from profound chronic immune suppression l eading to recurrent or life- threatening infections. Close monitoring is recommended after all ogeneic HCT or donor lymphocyte infusion so that appropriate treatmen t and supportive care can be instituted promptly to prevent serious outcome. 46H. Guidelines for treatment of chronic GVHD We strongly recommend that you consult the LTFU offi ce (Appendix A) before beginning treatment and before making changes in immunosuppressive tr eatment for patients with chronic GVHD. Clinical trials should always be considered because current standard therapies are associated with high morbidity and decreased survival for patients with high risk chronic GVHD (Section X.A. 2). Appendix D is a modified chronic GVHD Scoring and A ssessment form to help physicians to evaluate patients for chronic GVHD. Appendix E is another tool developed to help physicians to assess skin thickness in patients with sclerotic features or f asciitis related to chronic GVHD. Appendix C provides a cartoon with body area surface to help calculati ng the percentage of skin involved by GVHD. Table 4 outlines the criteria curren tly used for indication of systemic therapy in patients diagnosed with chronic GVHD according to global seve rity (Table 3) and risk factors. Table 4. Indication for systemic treatment for chronic GVHD Global severity High risk* Prolonged systemic therapy Mild No No Mild Yes Yes Moderate Yes or No Yes Severe Yes or No Yes See Table 3 * Patients with either thrombocytopenia (<100,000/microliter) or recei ving glucocorticoids at time of diagnosis of chronic GVHD. The benefits of graft-versus-tumor effect and th e risk of chronic GVHD require careful consideration especially in patients transplanted for ma lignancy with high risk of relapse. Standard treatment of chronic GVHD usually begi ns with administration of glucocorticoids (1mg/kg/day) followed by taper to eventually reach an alternate-day regimen, with or without daily cyclosporine or tacrolimus (FK506). Other medications used for glucocorticoid-resistant or dependent chro nic GVHD or in combination are displayed on Table 5. Telephone consultation with the LTFU medical team is available to you, seven days a week, to discuss appropriate treatment and provide other follow up recommendations (Appendix A). The duration of systemic immunosuppressive treatment of chronic GVHD varies but requires at least one year of therapy. Approximately 80% of patients require systemic immunosuppressive for 2 years and 40% of them requires therapy for at least 4 years. 47I. Table 5.

In patients also taking sirolimus, it is generally recomme nded that tacrolimus levels not exceed 10 nanograms/mL In patients also taking sirolimus, it is generally recommended that cyclosporine levels not exceed 200 nanograms/mL 48XI. GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR PREVEN TION OF OSTEOPOROSIS I NDUCED OSTEOPOROSIS Treatment with high-dose glucocor ticoids has been recognized as the primary risk factor for development of osteoporosis after stem cell tr ansplantation. Areas of loss include the femoral neck, vertebrae, ribs. Glucocor ticoid myopathy and muscle weakness may contribute to osteoporosis by removing the normal forces on bone that are produced by muscle contraction. In hematopoietic transplant recipients, other factor s that may contribute to osteoporosis include electrolyte imbalances, inactivity, significant weight loss, and endocrine deficiencies. Two degrees of bone loss can be described. Os teopenia is defined as bone mineral density less than -1 standard deviation but above -2.5 st andard deviations below the peak mean of young normal controls [T-score]. A T-scor e of < -2.5 is defined as osteoporosis. A. Patient monitoring Women : Baseline and annual measurement of FSH a nd estradiol for ages > 10 and < 61 years Men: Baseline and annual measurement of LH, FSH and free testosterone for ages < 60 years, Free testosterone and FSH for ages > 60 years Baseline and followup prostate exam, meas urements of PSA and lipid profile in men who are being treate d with testosterone All patients: Height: twice yearly Weight: monthly. DEXA SCANS: a) for allogeneic patients on steroid therapy, Dexa scan annually during steroid therapy b) for all other allogeneic patients > 40 years of age, Dexa scan at one year post transplant c) for all autologous lymphoma and myeloma transplant patients, Dexa scan at one year post transplant. d) for all pediatric patients not on steroid therapy, Dexa scan at one year post transplant only if Dexa scan at Discharge from SCCA system was abnormal Urinary N-telopeptide (NTx): baseline and at three months from starting treatment with bisphosphonates, or as clinica lly indicated. NTx test (Ost eomark) is used to assess treatment response of bisphosphonate. It measur es urinary excretion of the cross-linked N-telopeptide of type I collagen which is a marker of bone resorption. A decrease of 30% or greater in urinary NTx is clinically significant (Eastell et al.: Biological variability of serum and urinary N-telopeptides of type I collagen in postmenopausal women. J Bone Miner Res. 2000; 15: 594-8. 49 Vitamin D blood level - Vitamin D (25 Hydroxy) blood level shoul d be checked between 80-100 days post transplant for all patients. - Vitamin D (25 Hydroxy) levels are ge nerally rechecked 2-3 months after beginning therapy and th e target level is 30 ng/mL. Patients treated with bisphosphonate: liver function tests, calcium, magnesium, creatinine and electrolytes shoul d be measured at baseline an d at least monthly thereafter B. Elemental Calcium requirement between diet and supplement The Medical Nutrition Therapy staff educates pa tients to consume the following amounts of calcium during steroid therapy: Age 7-12 months 600 mg/day Age > 9 years: 1500 mg/day The nutritionist recommends appropriate levels of calcium supplementation for patients unable to meet daily requirements with diet. Calcium citrate is the preferred formulation. Calcium requirement for patients not on steroid therapy: Age Minimal Calcium requirements (milligrams) day) Children 7-12 months 250 Children 1-3 years 700 Children 4-8 years 1000 Children 9-18 years 1300 Adult Males 1000-1200 Adult Females On hormone therapy Not on hormone therapy 1000-1200 1500 50C. Vitamin D requirement Currently there is not substa ntive benefit by choosing Vitami n D2 or vitamin D3 over the other with regard to correcting Vitamin D (25 Hydroxy) levels. The more important decision is prescribing enough. Dose freque ncy appears to be less important than cumulative amount so that 2000 IU daily for 50 days is approximately equivalent to giving 50,000 IU monthly for 2 months. Table 1: Vitamin D3 (or D2) Supplementation Adults (>18 yrs) Children (<18 yrs) Prevention of Deficiency / Treatment of Insufficiency [ Vitamin D (25 Hydroxy) levels 20-30 ng/mL ] 2 Routine 1000 IU per day Age < 1 yr: 400 IU daily (800 IU in dark skinned) Age yr: syndromes1 IU yr: Consult Endocrinology Age 1-18 yr: 50,000 IU per week or 5000 IU daily Chronic Renal Disease Consult Nephrology Consult Nephrology Treatment of Deficiency [Vitamin D (25 Hydroxy) level <20 ng/mL]2 Uncomplicated 50,000 IU per wk x 8 (Repeat if Vitamin D (25 Hydroxy) level < 30 ng/mL otherwise treat as for insufficiency above) Age 1-12 months: Age 1-18 1000-5000 IU daily x 8 wks or 50,000 IU weekly x 8 (Repeat if Vitamin D (25 Hydroxy) level < 30 ng/mL otherwise treat as for insufficiency above) Malabsorption syndromes1 10,000-50,000 IU daily or every other day UVB irradiation in patients also with skin GVHD Age < 1 yr: Consult Endocrinology Age 1-18 yr: 50,000 IU per week Chronic Renal Disease Consult Nephrology Consult Nephrology 1 Patients who remain deficient or insufficient after adequate therapy are generally treated with hydroxylated vitamin D metabolites which are more readily absorbed or , if feasible, with sun or sunlamp exposure. While 25-OH vitamin D (Calcidiol) is the most logical choice of activated vitamin D for patients with liver disease, calcidiol is not readily available in the U.S. The 1,25-OH activated formul ation of vitamin D (Calcitriol) is used most commonly in chronic renal disease when th ere is secondary hyperparathyroidism. Calcitriol can also be used in patients with liver disease or severe malabsorption when there is a lack of the 25-OH vitamin D substrate to be converted to 1,25-OH vitamin D by the kidney. 2 Vitamin D (25 Hydroxy) levels are generally rechecked 2-3 months after beginning therapy and the target level is 30 ng/mL. 51 D. Magnesium Hypomagnesemia may result in hypocalcemia , peripheral vitamin D resistance and resistance to parathyroid hormone. Normal serum magnesium levels are necessary to prevent osteopenia and bone fragility. Patients taking cyclos porine or tacrolimus should receive adequate magnesium supplementation to maintain normal concentrations of serum magnesium (see Section XX) E. Exercise A combination of weight bear ing and resistive exercise is recommended for 30-60 minutes daily to promote cardiovascular function, mini mize bone loss, strengthen skeletal muscles and improve balance, helping to prevent falls. Appropriate forms of exercise include swi mming, biking (on a stati onary bike if the patient has poor balance), No rdic tracking, rowing, low impact aerobic dancing. Duration should be gradually increased to 30-60 minutes daily. Excessive stress to joints caused by high impact exercise (running, jumping, etc.) should be avoided. F. Gonadal hormone replacement Females: Women who are not on hormonal therapy with estrogen can be treated with biphosphonates. Males: Free testosterone, FSH and LH evaluated as follows: LH, FSH and free testosterone for ages < 60 years, Free testosterone and FSH for ages > 60 years Testosterone replacement should be prescribed as appropriate. Testosterone replacement should be given to men if the serum testoste rone level is low, unl ess contraindicated. G. Bisphosphonates Therapy with anti-resorptive agents to prevent bone loss may be considered for T-score less than -1 for HCT recipients with a prior sign ificant history of corticosteroid exposure and those with GVHD anticipated to remain on long te rm corticosteroids. In low risk patients with a T-score between -1 and -2.5 (osteopeni a), we encourage assessment of fracture risk (eg, using the FRAX score)( www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/ ). Anti-resorptive therapy can be considered in patients who are at high risk for subsequent fractures. All patients with osteoporosis (T-score < -2.5) or bone loss-associated fractur es should be offered therapy. (McClune, Navneet S Majhail, and Mary E.D. Flowers Bone Loss and Avascular Necrosis of Bone After Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation. Semin Hematol 49:59-65, January 2012 ) Bisphosphonates are effective for prevention and treatment of post-menopausal and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Because the risks and benefits of bisphosphonates during the early posttransplant period are unc lear, consideration of bisphosphonate therapy is not recommended for osteoporosis until at approximately 3 months posttransplant. 52Bisphosphonates (Continued) Adults with hip or vertebral fractures, or documented osteoporosis (DEXA T score < -2.5) may receive either oral or intravenous bisphosphonate therapy. Therapy is also advised for posttransplant patients with osto epenia (T-score -1.0 to -2.5) who are not receiving hormone replacement therapy and who are to receive prolonged glucocorticoid therapy. For postmenopausal women, and men age 50 and over, the widely used FRAX\u00ae WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool ( www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/ ) can be used to help guide which patients with osteopenia might benef it from bisphosphonate therapy based on their estimated 10-year hip fracture probability being 3% or their 10-year major osteoporosis related fracture probability being 20%. Therapy is usually continued unt il glucocorticoid therapy ha s been discontinued and the T- score enters the normal range (-1.0 to +1.0) or the risk for fractures based on the FRAX\u00ae tool is no longer increased. In patients taking alendronate for 5 years or more, post-marketing reports have recently highlighted the occurrence of atypical hip fractures. (Watts NB and Diab DL. Long-term use of bisphosphonates in osteoporosis. J Clin Endocrinol Metab 95: 1555-1565, 2010.) Secondary analyses of the results from 3 larg e randomized bisphosphonate trials showed that rates of subtrochanteric or diaphyseal femoral fractures were very low (1 to 6 cases per 10,000 patient years). While these analyses did not demonstrate an increase in risk associated with bisphosphonate use, the study was underpowered for definitive conclusions. (Black DM et al. Bisphosphonates and fractur es of the subtronchanteric or diaphyseal femur. N Engl J Med 362: 1761-1771, 2010.) One approach to consider for patients at m ild risk for fracture is to stop bisphosphonate therapy after 5 years and remain off as long as bone mineral density is stable and no fractures occur. Higher risk patients may be treated for 10 years, and then consider having a bisphosphonate holiday for 1-2 years, with nonbisphosphonate therapy during that time. (Watts NB and Diab DL. Long-term use of bisphosphonates in osteoporosis. J Clin Endocrinol Metab 95: 1555-1565, 2010. Children with documented osteoporosis based on Z- score, or at risk for reduced BMD may be considered for bisphosphonate therapy after discussion with the Pedi atrician. If it is determined that bisophosphonate therapy is a ppropriate, the specific bisphosphonate regimen will be decided by the Pediatrician, often in collaboration with a consulting Pediatric Endocrinologist. Cautionary Notes about Bisphosphonates: Intravenous bisphosphonates are not recommende for patients with clearance <35 ml/minute. Oral bisphosphonates can cause esophageal ulceration (pill esophagitis). Oral administration should be discontinued if patient s develop esophageal symptoms. 53 Drugs: i. Alendronate (Fosamax) Osteoporosis treatment: Administer alendronate as a single dose of 70 mg weekly (or 35 mg twice weekly). ii. Risedronate (Actonel) Osteoporosis treatment: Administer risedronate as a single dose of 35 mg weekly (or 150 mg monthly). iii. Pamidronate (Aredia) In adults a regimen of 60 mg IV for th e first dose followed by 30 mg every 3 months has been used successfully in the nontr ansplant setting. Ur inary N-telopeptide (Osteomark) can be used to determine th e appropriate dosing intervals needed. iv. Zoledronate (Reclast\u00ae) Zoledronate may be given as a single 5 mg intravenous dose once a year H. Calcitonin as secondary therapy for osteoporosis Calcitonin (100-200 International Units nasal spra y daily) may be given to adults if the measures described above are not adequate. I. Low Sodium Diet Sodium increases urinary calcium loss. A reduced sodium diet (<4 grams daily) is encouraged during steroid therapy. J.

HYPERLIPIDEMIA especially chronic elevation of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL- C), is an established risk fact or for premature (<55 years) cor onary heart disease (CHD) in the general population. It is also important to recognize that survivors of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have been shown to expe rience increased cardiovascular death compared to a randomly selected matched control population.1 Increased cumulative incidence of CHD, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, stroke, vascular diseases, rhythm disorders, hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes was also shown am ong these HCT survivors. The latter three conditions are also relevant because together with abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and prothrombotic/inflammatory states, they constitute a cluster of risk factors for premature CHD known as the metabolic syndrome . Recipients of allogeneic HCT did not differ from their autologous counterparts aside from having a high er rate of hypertension. A 49% prevalence rate (95% CI: 38%-60%) for metabolic syndrome has b een noted among long-term survivors of HCT, or a 2.2-fold increase (95% CI, 1.3-3.6, P = 0.002) compared with controls in one cross-sectional study. 2 Taking all these observations together it follows that effective management of hyperlipidemia be considered for patients who have undergone HCT. A. Principles and special considerations for lipid lowering therapy after HCT The approach outlined here follows the guidance of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) and includes inte rventions with therapeutic lifestyle changes and drug therapy that are calibrated pr imarily to LDL goals as determined by CHD risk category (see http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidel ines/cholesterol/index.htm ): Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) include: Dietary saturated fat < 7% of calories, transfat < 1% of cal ories, cholesterol < 200 mg/day Dietary increased soluble fiber 10-25 g/day Omega-3-fatty acid supplements may impr ove triglyceride and LDL-C levels but most are not regulated and are of variable content. Therefore, consuming a diet rich in omege-3-fatty acids is the preferable method of supplementation (major sources include flaxseed oil, canola oil, walnut oil, wheat germ , soybeans, mackerel, herring, salmon, sardines in oil, and swordfish). Weight management Increased physical activity on a regular basis/ regular exercise regimen Management of hyperlipidemia in the general population begins and always includes TLC. However, after hematopoietic cell transplant ation TLC are not always possible due to transplant-related complications or concerns. ATPIII drug therapy first focuses on achieving goal LDL levels using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) because they protect ag ainst premature CHD and improve survival among those with elevated cholesterol levels in the general population. 55 Statins also protect against pr emature CHD and improve survival in solid organ transplant recipients.4-12 Additional roles for statins in media ting improved renal function, control of hypertension, osteopenia, avascular necros is, and even GVHD have been suggested.14-20 While statins may offer sim ilar benefits for Blood or Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) survivors with hyperlipidemia the safety of sta tins has not been estab lished in this group and extra caution is advised due to the potentia l for important drug interactions in the BMT setting. B. Algorithm for Evaluation and Manageme nt of Hyperlipidemia in BMT Survivors Step 1: Exclude untreated hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome and obstruc tive liver disease. Step 2: Identify presence of clinical atherosclerotic disease (CHD or \"CHD risk equivalents\" which include symptomatic carotid artery disease, peri pheral vascular disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm) and if present the 10-year risk is > 20% (\"High-risk\") and then skip to Step 4. Step 3: Consider major risk factors other than LDL, CHD or CHD risk equiva lents (ie. Cigarette smoking, hypertension, low HDL, premature CHD in a 1st degree relative, age) and categorize as \"Moderate\" or \"Low\" 10-year risk using the Framingham tables or online risk calculator available at: http://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/atpiii /calculator.asp?usertype=prof . Step 4: Establish the LDL goal of therapy and dete rmine the need for TLC and drug therapy: Simplified Fasting Level Target Goals for BMT patients adapted from ATPIII Risk Category LDL Goal (mg/dL) LDL level to begin TLC (mg/dL) LDL level to consider drug therapy (mg/dL) High 10-yr risk > 20%: CHD or CHD risk equivalents <100 100 130 Moderate 2+ risk factors <130 130 130 if 10-yr risk 10-20% or 160 if 10-yr risk <10% Low 10-yr risk 10% 0-1 risk factors <160 160 190 Step 5: If clinically feasible in a post-transplant survivor initia te TLC if LDL is above goal. Step 6: Consider adding drug therapy with TLC for Hi gh-risk (CHD/CHD-equivale nts). For other risk categories, if clinically feasible allow a 3- month trial of TLC before adding drug therapy 56 Suggested Medication Options for High LDL-C in Adults* after BMT Drug Daily Dosea mg Class Effects Precautions and Monitoring Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) Start at lowest doses and rarely exceed middle of the dose range when taking concomitantly calcineurin inhibitors . LDL 18-55% HDL 5-15% TG 7-30% Contraindicated in liver disease Counsel patient to report muscle pain, weakness, dark or cola-colored urine, especially when accompanied by fever and malaise. Routinely monitor liver functions at baseline, 2 & 4 weeks and then monthly on therapy. If myopathy or rhabdomyolysis is suspected, or if AST/ALT are significantly elevated stop therapy and check CK and creatinine. Toxicities may occur weeks to many months after starting therapy. Toxicities are potentially enhanced by CYP3A4 inhibitors b like cyclosporine, tacrolimus, macrolide statin dose when adding a calcineurin inhibitor or other of statins . b Adverse interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors may be less for statins metabolized by toxicities have been reported for all statins. c Patients on 80 mg for more than 1 year can continue (Check manufacturer black box warning) Step 7: Risk benefit ratio of drug therapy for mana gement of hyperlipidemia should always be considered and medical intervention individualized in BMT recipients. 57 Step 8: Identify metabolic syndrome based on presence of any three of the following: Abdominal obesity: - Men - Women Waist circumference: >102 (>40 inches) >88 cm (>35 inches) Hypertriglyceridemia 150 mg/dL Low cholesterol - Men Women mg/dL mg/dL Hypertension Per mg/dL Treat any underlying causes: Intensify weight management Increase physical activity on a regul ar basis/ regular exercise regimen Treat lipid and non-lipid risk factors if they persist despite TLC: Treat hypertension (See hypertensi on section of LTFU guidelines) Consider aspirin for CHD patients to reduce prothrombotic state if not contraindicated Treat elevated triglyceride s and/or low HDL (Step 9) Step 9: Treat elevated triglycerides: Primary aim of therapy is to reach LDL goal Intensify weight management Increase physical activity on a regul ar basis/ regular exercise regimen If triglycerides are 200 mg/dL after LDL goal is reached, set secondary goal for non-HDL-C (total - HDL) 30 mg/dL highe r than LDL goal (see Table below): Non-HDL goals for HCT survivors Risk Category Non-HDL Goal (mg/dL) High\": 10-yr risk > 20%: CHD or risk equivalents <130 Moderate : 10-yr factors <190 58 Therapies for Hyperlipidemia for Adult Patients Drug Daily Dose mg Class EffectsPrecautions and Monitoring Omega-3-Acid Ethyl Estersa Generally minimal side effects, eructation, potentiate INR if on warfarin Avoid if fish/shellfish allergic Monitor AST/ALT periodically Has been combined with mixed hyperlipidemia Fibric Acids Fenofibrate (Tricor) Gemfibrozil (Lopid) Start at lowest doses and rarely exceed middle of the dose range when taking concomitantly calcineurin inhibitors. 48-145 600-1200 LDL 5-20% HDL 10-20% TG 20-50% in severe liver or renal disease May cause myopathy especially when combined with statins, and in setting of impaired renal function in patients receiving cyclosporine or other drugs that interact with statins May cause cholelithiasis and GI symptoms May cause reversible increase in serum creatinine Fenofibrate-statin combination may be better that gemofribrozil-statin therapy because gemfibrozil can increase statin levels by 2-6 fold Counsel patient to report muscle pain, weakness, dark or cola-colored urine, especially when accompanied by fever and malaise. Routinely monitor liver functions (including AST/ALT) at baseline, 2 & 4 weeks and then monthly on therapy. If myopathy or rhabdomyolysis is suspected, or if AST/ALT are significantly elevated stop therapy and check CK and creatinine. Toxicities may occur weeks to many months after starting therapy. Toxicities are potentially enhanced by CYP3A4 inhibitors b like cyclosporine, tacrolimus, macrolide antibiotics, over the counter omega-3-acid ethyl esters ar e generally insufficient to significantly lower triglycerides and VLDLs. Only Lovaza\u00ae has been approved for this indication. Consult Pharmacy for pediatric dosing of Lovaza\u00ae or fibric acids. If triglycerides 200-499 mg/dL after LD L goal is reached consider intensifying therapy with LDL-lowering drug, or add fibrate or Lovaza\u00ae to further lower VLDL. If statin fails to lower both LDL and TG it is very reasonable to consider referral to consultant cardiologist, endocrinologist, or ot her expert on high risk patients with mixed hyperlipidemia. If triglycerides > 500 mg/dL, first lowe r triglycerides to prevent pancreatitis: Add fibrate unless counterindicated Or Lovaza\u00ae if patient is unable to take fibrates Very low-fat diet Weight management and physical activity 59 XIII. HYPERTENSION New onset or aggravation of hypertension o ccurs frequently after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with the most common cause of hypert ension after allogeneic HCT being due to treatment with glucorticoids and tacrolimus or cyclosporine. It is important to recognize also that HCT survivors have a high prevalence metabolic syndrom e which represents a cluster of risk conditions associated with pr emature coronary heart disease (CHD).1 Components of the metabolic syndrome including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes occurred with higher cumulative incidence among HCT survivors compar ed to a randomly selected matched control.2 Thus, adequate control of hypertension is strongly recommended in HCT r ecipients to minimize target organ damage and most importa ntly in the brain, heart and kidneys. A. Key Points about Hyperten sion and its treatment In uncomplicated hypertension, without di abetes mellitus, renal dysfunction or cardiac dysfunction the blood pr essure (BP) goals are indicated in the table below Age (y) Male Female 18 140/90 140/90 17 Pediatric data based on 90th percentile limits for blood pressure at The 50th percentile for height (1999-2000 NHANES) If an adult patient has a diagnosis of diabetes and/or renal dysfunction, the BP goal is < 130/80 mm HG. If an adult patient has more than 1 gm of proteinuria, the BP goal is < 125/75 mm HG. B. Other key points about control of hypertension and treatment : Reductions in myocardial in farctions, stroke incidence and heart failure with BP lowering below 140/90 mm HG are approximate ly 25%, 35%, and 50%, respectively. Patients with SBP > 160 mm HG and/or DBP > 100 mm HG tend to need two different agents and it is recommended that two agents are begun at the same time. 60 Caffeine intake and nicotine use an hour before blood pressure monitoring may give falsely elevated readings. Referral to a hypertension specialist is adv ised for patients with poorly controlled blood pressure. In the general population, thiazide diuretics should be used in drug treatment for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, alon e or combined with drugs from other classes but the potential of thiazides to aggravate pr e-renal azotemia and other electrolyte abnormalities ofte n limit their use in HCT. No single class of drugs has emerged as the standard of care for management of hypertension in patients receiving calcineuri n inhibitors (CNI). Other agents may be indicated for patients with other co-morbidities (s ee Table 1). Table 1 - Antihypertensive Medicati ons According to Clinical Setting Clinical Setting Anti-Hypertensive Therapy Monitoring Uncomplicated Hypertension Options include CCB, beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, ACE-I or ARBs If not on CNI or at risk for volume depletion, thiazide diuretics are the treatment of choice . If used with CNI, limit dose to 12.5-25 mg per day to limit most metabolic side effects. Calcium Channel Blockers ( CCB) can affect CNI levels (cyclosporine and tacrolimus). Check CNI levels with K and Cr 7-10 days starting CCB. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs CCB may worsen proteinuria Beta-blockers sympathetic activity including CNI induced headaches/migraines and tachyarrhythmias. Chronic kidney disease*, history of AKI, presence of proteinuria or microalbuminuria (see Table 2) ACE-I/ARB, Possibly in combination with CCB if still on CNI. Avoid CCB alone due to further increase in proteinuria Consider holding during persistent diarrhea, vomiting or poor fluid intake Check serum K and Cr 7- 10 days after adding Diabetes With or without proteinuria Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin II receptor (ARBs) No interactions with CNI. May aggravate hyperkalemia and prerenal azotemia; avoid in patients with or at risk for volume depletion. Consider holding during persistent diarrhea, vomiting or poor fluid intake Check serum K and Cr 7- 10 days after adding Heart Failure Diuretics ACE-I or ARBs Beta-blockers Careful to avoid pre-renal azotemia potent loop diuretics. Consider adding spironolact one or eplerenone if no hyperkalemia but monitor for subsequent hyperkalemia . Carvedilol and metoprolol are beta-blockers of choice For those unable to tolerate ACE-I and ARB's, therapy with hydralazine plus isosorbide may be beneficial, particularly in African Americans 61 Table 1 - Antihypertensive Medications According to Clinical Setting (continued) Clinical Setting Anti-Hypertensive Therapy Monitoring High-risk for Coronary Artery Disease ACE-I, ARBs, calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers. Diuretic may also be indicated based on risk/benefits profile Calcium Channel Blockers ( CCB) can affect CNI levels (cyclosporine and tacrolimus). Check CNI levels with K and Cr 7-10 days after starting CCB. Ischemic Heart Disease Beta blockers Carvedilol and metoprolol of choice the Consider adding spironol actone or eplerenone if hyperkalemia is not present History of Strokes Calcium channel blockers, thiazides or ARB. Calcium Channel Blockers ( CCB) can affect CNI levels (cyclosporine and tacrolimus). Check CNI levels with K and Cr 7-10 days after starting CCB. Hypertensive Urgency not requiring hospitalization Clonidine Labetatlol Hydralazine Preferred option is to consult a hypertension expert Clonidine has rapid onset of action, can cause dry mouth and somnolence; avoid for general use Hydralazine can cause edema and tachycardia Evaluate patient every 1-3 days to assess response to therapy CCB; calcium channel blockers, * Definition of chronic kidney disease (CKD) criteria 1. Kidney damage for > 3 months, as defined by structural or functional abnormalities of the kidney, with or without decreased GFR, manifest by either: Pathological abnormalities; or Markers of kidney damage, including abnormalities in the composition of the blood or urine, or abnormalities in imaging tests 2. GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for > 3 months, with or without kidney damage C. Evaluation for microalbuminuria and additional recommendations Screening for microalbuminuria before and after transplant is helpful for early diagnosis of proteinuria and to guide treat ment. Microalbuminuria is determined by measuring the albumin and creatinine ratio in an urine sample. 62Table 2. Recommendations based on albu min/creatinine ratio and hypertension Spot Urine Albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) Interpretation Recommendations Less 30 mg/g Normal - Repeat U ACR in 1 year 30-300 mg/g without hypertension and not on hypertensive medications Abnormal - Repeat U ACR in 3-6 months 30-300 mg/g with hypertension and on hypertensive medications Abnormal - If not already on, c onsider change to ACE-I or ARB therapy - Repeat U ACR in 3-6 months Greater than 300 mg/g on hypertensive medications Abnormal - If not already on, consider treating with ACE-I or ARB therapy - Quantify 24-hr total urine protein - If proteinuria (>1 gram) confirmed, refer to nephrologist - Monitor spot U ACR in 3 months 63 XIV. RECURRENT MALIGNANCY In most cases recurrent malignancy occurs within the first 2 years after the transplant, with few occurring more than 5 years after the transplant. For patients who had leukemia or other hemato logical malignancies, peripheral blood counts should be monitored at least monthly for the first year. Monitoring for minimal residual disease and recurrent malignancy will vary acco rding to the specific disease and enrollment in specific protocols. Chimerism testing in blood or bone marrow may be needed to help establish the diagnosis of recurrent malignancy and to assess options for treatment (adoptive immunotherapy, biologic res ponse modifiers, gene th erapy among others). If recurrent malignancy is su spected or confirmed, please co ntact the LTFU office (Appendix A) promptly to discuss additional di agnostic tests and treatment options. 64XV. SECONDARY MALIGNANCIES Recipients of hematopoietic st em cell transplant have an increased risk of developing secondary malignancies, including skin cance rs, solid tumors, myelodysplastic syndromes, leukemias and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Solid tumors that occur at increased frequency include skin cancers (squamous cell, basal cell, malignant melanoma) and cancers of the buccal cavity, followed by liver, central nervous system, thyroid, bone, and connective tissue. PTLD generally occurs within the first year after the transplant, predominantly in patients who received T cell-depleted grafts and in patients treated with intensive immunosuppressive regimens to control GVHD. All transplant recipients s hould have oncologic screening ev aluations at annual intervals throughout life. We recommend the following general guidelines for oncologic screening. 1. Skin exam with the comple te physical and history 2. Pap smears & mammogram (women > 35 years) & education to reinforce self breast exams 3. Prostate exam and PSA (men > 45 years) 4. Occult blood in stool (> 40 years) 5. Colonoscopy (baseline at age 50 years and as clinically indicated thereafter) 6. Oral exam by the dentist at 6 month intervals 7. Complete blood counts, thyroid functi on, and other tests as applicable All patients should use sunblocking creams (> 30 SPF - sun protection factor) when outdoors to prevent skin cancers and to prev ent activation of chronic GVHD. Please contact the LTFU office (Appendix A) if you are planning surgery or a biopsy for evaluation of suspected secondary malignanc y or if secondary malignancy has been diagnosed. 65XVI. OTHER COMPLICATIONS A. G ONADAL HORMONE INSUFFICIENCY Gonadal hormone insufficiency is related to the age of the patient a nd the intensity of the transplant preparative regimen. 1. MALES: Men who were past puberty at the time of transplant may develop primary gonadal failure. Prepubertal boys may require treatment with gradually escalated doses of testosterone to promote sexual maturation. Testosterone replacem ent should also be considered in men who are receiving corticos teroids for long-term treatment of chronic GVHD (see Section XI). Men who receive test osterone replacement therapy should have a baseline prostate exam and measurement of pros tate specific antigen (PSA), liver enzymes and serum lipids. Follow-up monitoring of these parameters may be appropriate. 2. FEMALES : Women often develop primary ovarian failure and have symptoms of premature menopause. They are also at risk for development of osteoporosis. Permanent ovarian failure invariably occurs in all female patients who receive busulfan and cyclophosphamide (BU/CY). Recovery of ovarian function has been observed after transplant in 54% of younger patients (less than 26 years) conditioned with cyclophosphamide alone. The probability of ova rian function recovery after fractionated TBI is at least 10% by 6 years after transplant. Premature (<40 years) or early (40 - 50 years) onset of menopausal symptoms and osteoporosis can significantly affect th e quality of life of women after a he matopoietic cell transplant (HCT). During the past 20 years, replacement therapy with estrogen alone (for pa tients without a uterus) or combined with progestin (for patients with a uterus) has be en used to prevent or treat menopausal symptoms and to prevent bone loss. In children, hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) is needed after transplant to promote the development of s econdary sexual characteristics. a) Benefits and risks of comb ined estrogen plus progestin after stem cell transplant Combined estrogen plus progestin (E+P) can tr eat hot flashes, vagina l and vulvar symptoms, prevent bone loss and improve the quality of life for HCT recipien ts who are postmenopausal or who have premature ovarian failure. The pos itive effect on cognitive function claimed by many women taking estrogen remains to be confirmed. In young girls, estrogen replacement therapy is often critical for the development of secondary sexual characteristics and for the attainment of peak bone mass in early adulthood. The best evidence we have so far about the safe ty of E+P using conjugated equine estrogen and medroxyprogesterone (Prempro , E = 0.625 mg, P = 2.5 mg) in 50 to 79 year-old postmenopausal woman who have not previously undergone HCT, and w ho have a uterus, are well detailed in the large randomized WHI study (JAMA 2002; 288: 321-333). Another estrogen replacement therapy alone in po st-menopausal women without a uterus is still in progress. The WHI trial cl early indicated that the combined increased risks for coronary heart disease, stroke, pulmonary embolism and invasive breast cance rs in woman who took 66Prempro exceeded the combined health benefits of reduced risks for co lorectal cancer and hip fractures. There was no effect on survival. The already increased risk of secondary cancers po sttransplant ought to be strongly considered in conjunction with the WHI conclusi ons regarding E+P replacement th erapy. The relative risk of a new cancer is 2.2 at 5 years, 5.0 at 15 years a nd 8.1 at 20 years posttransplant compared to a normal population matched for age and sex. In partic ular, an increased risk of breast cancer has been observed among patients who have survived for more than 10 years posttransplant (observed/expected ratio = 3.3, Rizzo et al, Blood 2000; 96: 2390a). Radiation has been identified as the primary risk factor associated generally with the development of solid tumors after a stem cell transplant. b) Special Situations: Women without a uterus: the fi ndings of the WHI study regard ing combined E+P can not be extrapolated to women who have undergone hys terectomy and who have premature ovarian failure. Unless medically contraindicated (see be low) estrogen alone may be prescribed for the relief of menopausal symptoms and to prev ent bone loss caused by ovarian failure after the transplant. Temporary relief of menopausal symptoms: Unle ss medically contraindicated, a finite course of E+P may be prescribed for women with a ut erus for the temporary relief of menopausal symptoms, provided that patients are frequently reassessed by their internist or gynecologist to determine the appropri ate duration of therapy. In prepubertal girls, treatm ent with estrogen may be critical to promote growth and development of secondary sexua l characteristics dur ing the transition from adolescence to adulthood. c) Hormonal Replacement Guidelines for Girls: Hormonal replacement in prepubertal girls should be done in collaboration with a pediatric endocrinologist . d) Hormonal Replacement Guidelines for Women: General considerations for po sttransplant HRT include: Management of ovarian failure should be ta ilored according to a patient's particular clinical manifestations a nd individual risks for side effects of HRT such as: a) history (or family history) of breast cancer b) history of deep venous thrombosis , stroke or hypercoaguable state c) history (or family history of colorectal cancer d) severe osteoporosis with vertebral crush fractures e) presence of absence of a uterus Overall benefits and risks of long-term HRT should be discussed with each patient. 67 Information about non-hormonal alternatives for management of ovarian failure manifestations should be discussed with all patients. A patient and her physician should be able to clearly state the indica tion (s) for which the patient is to start (or cont inue) posttransplant HRT. HRT should be prescribed at the lowest effective dose. Annual gynecological follow-up evaluati on is recommended for all women. Monthly self-breast examination is recommended for all women. Baseline mammography is recommended for a ll women from 35-40 years of age. Annual follow-up is also recommened. Yearly re-evaluation of a patient's ovarian failure management plan is recommended to determine if it remains the most appropriate plan for that patient. Specific Contraindications to HRT: Systemic E or E+P should not be prescribed fo r patients with a history of thromboembolic diseases (i.e., venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, strokes, etc.), hypercoagulation disorders, breast cancer or active liver disease. Caution is advised particularly for the prolonged combined use of E+P in women 50 years of age. Alternatives to HRT: Diet, exercise and other non-hormo nal strategies are available fo r management of hot flashes, insomnia and mood disturbances. Topical estrogen alone may relieve local vaginal/vulva symptoms caused by gonadal insufficiency. Osteoporosis can alternatively be treated with bisphosphonates in combination with adequate calcium and vitamin D intake (See Standard Practice Osteoporosis document). Difficulties such as decreased libido and/or dyspareunia may be multifactorial in etiology and may often be managed without the use of systemic conjugated equine estrogen and medroxyprogesterone. B. Endocrine hypothyroi dism, thyroiditis and thyroid neoplasms may develop in patients who received radiation. The inci dence of compensated hypothyroidism after 68fractionated total body irradia tion (TBI) before transplant ranges between 15-25%. Patients should be evaluated yearly with phys ical examination and thyroid function tests. Growth hormone (GH) deficiency and growth failure (decreased growth rate/year) occurs in 70-80% of children who rece ived total body irradiation or 1800 cGy cranial irradiation. The onset of GH de ficiency and growth failure varies with the age of the child at the time of irradiation. The onset of these problems appears to occur later in younger children than in peri-pubertal childr en. All children should have height monitored at least annually, and those <14 years of age should have annual GH testing until they either develop GH deficiency or are >1 4 years of age, whichever occurs first. Among pre-pubertal children, treatment with total body irradiation, busulfan or >2400 cGy testicular irradi ation may delay subsequent pubert al development. Children who received busulfan appear to have the highest risk of delayed or absent pubertal development. Approximately half of th e very young children tr eated with total body irradiation progress through pubertal development at an a ppropriate age, while older children treated with total body irradiation have a higher risk of delayed pubertal development. Treatment with cyclophos phamide alone does not delay pubertal development. Beginning at age 10, all children should have Tanner development scores determined as part of an annual physical examination. Child ren who are Tanner Stage I or II by age 12 years should be referred to a pediatric endocrinologist to ev aluate the need for hormonal supplementation. C. Ocular complications An annual eye exam with slit lamp examination is recommended for all patients who have had an allogeneic transpla nt and for those who are at risk of cataracts. The risk of cataracts after transplant is high for patient s who received fractionated TBI (30 - 50%) and for patients treated with corticosteroids af ter the transplant (45%). In patients who received neither TBI or prior cranial i rradiation, the incidence for cataract is approximately 15% and, is primarily due to co rticosteroids. The median time to develop cataracts after transplant ranges from 2 to 5 y ears. Cataract extraction can be performed safely even when ocular sicca is present. Unanticipated complicati ons after placement of an intraocular lens have not been reported. Other late complications involving the eyes are related to chronic GVHD as de scribed in Section X A and B. 69D. Oral complications and guidelines for dental care The new development of oral pain or dryness beyond day 100 after the transplant suggests the development of chronic GVHD involving salivary glands or the mucosal surface. Cultures for candida albicans and DFA or rapid cultures for herpes simplex virus should always be obtained to rule out concomitant infections. A dental/oral medicine consultation should be strongly c onsidered in all patients with oral complications. General guidelines for dental care in he matopoietic transplant recipients include: Routine (non-urgent/non-emergency) dental care especially in patients with chronic GVHD should be delayed for at least the first year after transplant due to increase risk of bacteremia because patients are still immunocompromised. Routine dental health examinations (w ith radiographs as needed) are recommended to monitor for tooth decay and oral hygiene effectiveness/gingivitis/periodontitis. Patients should be encouraged to carry out focused and effective oral hygiene (brushing, flossing, etc.). Patients with dry mouth should be placed on a regimen of daily brush-on fluoride gel to reduce the risk of dental decay. Complete blood cell counts with differen tial and platelet co unt should be checked before any dental procedure to assess the risk of bleeding and infection. When urgent or emergency dental treatme nt is required efforts should be taken to minimize bacteremia including prophylactic antibiotics and reduce the risk of aspiration of aerosolized bacteria and debris (i.e., perform proce dures under a rubber dam, use high volume suction, reduce air sp ray during procedures, etc.). For short non-surgical/non invasive surgical procedures, we recommend following the American Heart Association (AHA) prophylactic antibioti c recommendations. Antibiotic administration should be extended if there is significant local dental infection and risk of subsequent spread of infection (local or disseminated). In lieu of evidence based guidelines, pr ophylactic antibiotics (AHA guidelines for low- moderate endocarditis risk) should be used fo r all dental procedures in patients who have indwelling centr al venous catheters. 70E. Renal insufficiency Nephrotoxic drugs are the most common cause of impaired renal function after a stem cell transplant. Monitoring renal function and drug levels is recommended for all patients who are at risk of renal insu fficiency (Section III C & D). F. Neurological Complications Peripheral neuropathy and central nervous system complications may develop after transplantation. Neurological complications may be caused by drugs used to control GVHD (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) (Section X), electrolyte abnormalities, infection prior cranial irradiation, intrathecal chemotherapy, GVHD and malignancy. The following evaluation is recommended: 1) Perform neurological examination including mini-mental state exam. 2) Consider - Medications (CSA, FK506, opiods, benzodiazepines, high-dose steroids, hypoglycemia, etc.) - Non-CNS infection such as UTI, pneumonia, etc. - Unremitting pain or insomnia - Intracranial hemorrhage - Hypovolemia - due to bleeding or other cause - Head trauma - CNS malignancy - CNS infection When available, refer to institutional policies on the manag ement of patients with delirium. If medication/metabolic/endocrine/pain effect/sleep deprivation are felt to be unlikely etiologies OR if symptoms persist for >24-48 hours despite efforts to correct what's felt to be underlying cause: 1) Brain Imaging (MRI preferred) 2) Lumbar puncture Standard: cell count, protein, glucose, cytology, gram stain, bacterial/fungal cultures, HHV-6 PCR (viremia should not be assumed to be a marker for HHV-6 detection in the CSF), additional CSF saved for future studies Additional testing for malignancy of infection (see tabl e below) may be considered as clinically indicated: 3) Consider ID consult for evaluation of infectious etiologies of delirium 4) Consider Neurology consult for evaluation of neurological etiologies of delirium 5) Consider psychiatry consult for evaluation and treatment of delirium Depending on the clinical scenario, the followin g additional tests for infectious etiologies may be considered: 71Pathogen Relative Frequency Clinical Setting Recommended Initial Evaluation Viruses HHV-6 Frequent Early after transplant Temporal lobe VZV Occasional on ACV/GCV CSF: VZV PCR CMV Rare Donor or after transplant CSF: CMV PCR EBV Occasional T-cell depleted, including Nile Virus* Occasional Donor is from endemic state Significant mosquito exposure Neuromuscular weakness as component of meningoencephalitis CSF: WNV PCR (low sensitivity), IgM (MAC-ELISA) Serum: IgM Contact Public Health JC virus Rare Brain imaging: non-enhancing white matter lesions other work-up (low sensitivity) Plasma: Fungi Aspergillus and other molds Frequent Enhancing brain lesion (s) consistent with abscess Concurrent pulmonary lesions (nodules) High degree of Nocardia, brain lesion (s) consistent with abscess No additional testing recommended as these pathogens should be identified by standard bacterial culture. Syphilis Rare Positive pre-transplant serology Significant exposure or diffuse) or ring- enhancing lesion(s) Recipient from endemic area Positive PPD pretransplant Significant exposure CSF: AFB stain and culture, PCR (both, low sensitivity) * If concerned about other arboviruses, please discuss with Infectious Diseases. ** If concerned about non-tuberculous mycobacteria, please discuss with Infectious Diseases. If the appropriate test is not locally availa ble, arrangements should be made to send the specimen to another laboratory. Please c ontact the LTFU office (see Appendix A) 72 Some children, especially those given cranial irradiation before the transplant, may have learning disabilities (particularly in math ematics and abstract thinking). These abnormalities typically begin to appear 24-42 months after the transplant. When recognized as a problem, refer for psychologica l testing. Special e ducational instruction should be considered for these children. Short-term memory deficit ca n occur in adults, and psychometric testing should be performed as clinically indicated. Total body irradiation can dela y the onset of developmental landmarks in very young children. These effects are most severe thr oughout the first year after transplant, and affected children benefit from occupational therapy to assist their normal development. After they have achieved appropriate deve lopmental landmarks, further development appears to proceed normally. IQ and ability to succeed in school do not appear to be affected by total body irradiation. G. Bone Complications (see Section XI) Osteoporosis, fractures and avascular necros is (AVN) are common complications after transplantation. Long-term treat ment with corticosteroids is the primary risk factor for these complications, while gonadal failure, elec trolyte imbalances, physical inactivity and treatment with cyclosporine play an additiona l contributory role. Approximately 50% of patients receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy will eventually develop bone fractures. Increased osteoclast-mediate d bone resorption and decreased osteoblast- mediated bone formation cause trabecular bone loss. In allogeneic HCT recipients, evaluation for bone loss and osteoporosis includ es a careful assessment of risk factors (www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/ ) and exposures in addition to BMD measurement. (see References, section XXV, Other Complications, Bone Complications) Bone loss can be minimized by minimizing glucocorticoid dose, optimizing calcium and vitamin D intake, participating in weight-b earing exercise, and by hormone replacement therapy. Section XI provides detailed guidelines for preventing and monitoring osteoporosis in patients who ar e being treated with corticosteroids. Section XX describes vitamins and other minerals requirements. S ection XXI outlines diet for patients treated with corticosteroids. Section XI outlines hormone replacement therapy. H. Chronic Pulmonary Complications Some reports have shown that the FEV 1/FVC is less than 70% in 15% of patients by one year after the transplant a nd in 30% of patients by thr ee years after an allogeneic transplant. Among patients w ith chronic GVHD, 5-10% will develop severe obstructive airway disease that resembles obliterative br onchiolitis. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) with measurement of total lung capacity and DLCO should be evaluated at 1 and 5 years after transplant and yearly or more often in patients with chronic GVHD (Section X B). If new abnormalities are noted in PFTs please contact the LTFU office to discuss further recommendations (Appendix A). 73Children who received total body irradiation are at risk of delayed onset pulmonary restrictive disease 5-20 years after the transpla nt. All patients who were in the pediatric age group at the time of transplant shoul d have annual pulmonary function tests. I. Hepatobiliary Complications (see References, section XXV, Liver) Elevations of serum ALT, alka line phosphatase or bilirubin may occur after day 100, even in patients who had no indication of liver pr oblems earlier. The presentations fall into four clinical categories. Acute hepatitis. Elevations of serum ALT after day 100 are most commonly caused by drug-induced liver injury (a n azole antifungal or trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole are the most common cause s of Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) in this setting), chronic GVH D, an exacerbation of hepatitis B or C, or a herpesvirus hepatitis (VZV, HSV). Three clinical situations demand im mediate diagnosis and treatment. 1) Rapidly rising ALT accompanied by anorexia , abdominal distension or pain in the abdomen or back can be signs of visceral VZV infection (Section VIII B). 2) Patients who have indications of hepatitis B before transplant (HBsAg-positive or anti-HBc-positive) or who had a donor who was infected with hepatitis B are at risk of fulminant hepatitis B after the transplant if they did not receive antiviral prophylaxis.. 3) Chronic GHVD can present as an acute hepatitis, usually after tapering or discontinuation of immunosuppr essive medications, particularly cyclosporine or tacrolimus, or after DLI. Patients with a rapidly rising ALT and thos e with ALT values >500 u/L should be given IV acyclovir until VZV hepatitis is ruled out. An urgent PCR for VZV DNA in serum is needed to establish the di agnosis. Contact the LTFU office (Appendix A) for guidance in difficult cases. Chronic hepatitis. Chronic fluctuations in seru m ALT levels without a discrete episode of acute hepatitis may represent DILI, hepatitis B or C virus infection (Section XVII), iron overload (Secti on XVIII) or cGVHD (Section X). Jaundice or cholestasis. Elevated serum bilirubin and elevated alkaline phosphatase can be caused by chronic GVHD (Section X), drug-induced cholestasis, acute hepatitis (see above), or biliary obstr uction. An ultrasound should be obtained to evaluate whether the co mmon bile duct is dilated. Liver biopsy might not be needed in patients who ha ve cholestasis with biopsy-documented chronic GVHD in other organs. Some patients have liver involvement as the dominant manifestation of chronic GVHD, and liver biopsy might be needed in 74order to establish the diagnosis when other manifest ations of chronic GVHD are absent. Hepatomegaly or right upper quadrant pain. The sudden onset of hepatomegaly suggests acute hepatitis, Epstein-Barr virus-induced lymphoproliferative disorder involving the li ver, or rarely, Budd-Chiari syndrome. More indolent hepatomegaly can occur with metastatic tumor, leukemia infiltration or rarely, constrictive pericarditis or mycobacterial infection. Right upper quadrant pain can be caused by acute cholecystitis , biliary obstruction with cholangitis, biliary sludge syndrome, or rarely, fungal li ver abscess. Liver im aging with helical CT X-ray or ultrasound is needed to resolve the diagnosis. Suggestions for liver biopsy and handling of liver tissue. The technique of liver biopsy depends on the clinical situation (diffuse process vs. focal lesion) and the platelet count. A percutaneous biopsy is pref erred if platelet counts are >100,000/mm 3 and the risk of bleeding is small (including norm al PT/PTT) but transvenous biopsy through either the femoral or jugular route is satisfact ory for diagnosis of a ny diffuse hepatitis or GVHD. Tissue should be cultured for viruses and fungi and should be fixed in freshly- prepared neutral buffered formalin. J. Gastrointestinal Complications: (see References, section XXV, Liver) GVHD is the most common cause of anorexia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea after an allogeneic transplant. However, each of these symptoms has a narrow differential diagnosis that requires carefu l evaluation before concluding th at GVHD is the sole cause. Anorexia, nausea and vomiting can be caused by HSV, VZV, and CMV infections and by itraconazole, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine caused by visceral VZV infection, biliary sludge syndrom Barr virus-induced lymphoprolifer ative disease. Diarrhea o ccurring more than 3 months after transplant is commonly caused by magne sium - containing medications, unresolved GVHD, or less commonly by an infection (giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, C. difficile, or CMV). Section VII provides guidelines for evaluation of di arrhea and endoscopy. 75XVII. BLOOD PRODUCT TRANSFUSIONS All Red Blood Cells and Platelets be irradiated (2,500 cGy) to prevent transfusion related GVHD. Red blood cells an d platelets will also be leukocyte redu ced to prevent HLA alloimmunization and reduce the risk of CMV transmission. Leukocyte reduced blood components are accepted as \"CMV safe\" for CMV seronegative patients. Granulocytes are never leukoreduced. If the donor and recipient had ABO blood group incompatibility, low-grade hemolysis can delay erythroid recovery for ma ny months after the transplant . Hemagglutinin titers and reticulocyte counts should be followed to mon itor the change from recipient to donor ABO type. Type O red cells should be used for pa tients who have isoagglut inins against donor red blood cell antigens until the donor blood group type is fully established in the recipient. Treatment with erythropoietin can be benefici al in some patients. Donor-type platelets should be used for transfusions. 76XVIII. VIRAL HEPATITIS in long t erm transplant survivors (see References, section XXV, Liver) Compared to hepatitis C, hepatitis B is more lik ely to result in severe clinical hepatitis and death from post-transplant liver disease, although these outcomes occu r only in the minority of HBV-infected patients. One exception: patients infected by HCV who are receiving MMF for GVHD prophylaxis may develop a more severe, potentially fatal form of liver disease called fibrosing cholestati c hepatitis C. In this sett ing, it should be assessed whether MMF may be discontinued. Antiviral treatmen t should be considered for HBV-and HCV- infected transplant recipients unless contraindications are pr esent. Liver test abnormalities post-transplant may be caused by injury (Secti ons I, X and XV). In this situation, liver biopsy should be performed to determine the dominant pathologic process. A. Hepatitis B Even in patients with very low levels of viral replication before transp lantation and relatively normal liver function and histology, impaired cellular immunity can permit reactivation of HBV. Serological patterns of HBV infection may be atypical in transplant survivors, likely as a consequence of immunosuppression. Pa tients with HBV requiring systemic immunosuppressive medications for control of chronic GVHD remain at risk for acute exacerbation of hepatitis whenever immunosuppre ssion is tapered or ceased. Such flares may result in hepatic failure and death. Cirrhosis due to chronic HBV has not emerged as a major problem after transplantation. The risk of fatal HBV liver disease among pa tients who are persistently HBsAg-positive after transplant and who are not receiving lami vudine or entecavir is approximately 12%. In hematopoietic cell recipients who are anti-HBc and anti-HBs-positive, but HBsAg-negative, reactivation of latent infection can occur and may lead to fulminant hepatic failure, particularly if nucleotide substitutions in the precore region of the genome interfere with production of HBcAg. Because these patients remain HBcAg-negative despite high levels of viral replic ation, monitoring of HBV DNA leve ls is necessary in these HBsAg- positive patients. Posttransplant HBV infection may result from Active HBV infection before transplant Reactivation of latent HBV infection New infection during the transplantation process Infected hematopoietic cell pr oduct from an infected donor Infected blood products (risk estimated in U.S. to be 1 in 500, 000 units). 1) Monitoring of Patients at Risk for HBV Infection Moderate and high risk for HBV infec tions include patients who by PCR pretra nsplant OR patients who received hematopoietic cells was patients with markers of latent HBV infection (anti-HBc-positive) are at risk for HBV reactivation after transplant. Careful monitoring of the patients described above is recommended and includes: Serum ALT weekly for three months post tran splant, thereafter at least twice monthly until 1 year after HSCT and HBV DNA by PCR should be tested: A) For patients who were hepatitis B positiv e pre transplant: anytime at the onset of abnormal or worsening serum ALT. B) For patients who were hepatitis B negative pre transplant and receiving donor cells that were hepatitis B DNA or surf ace antigen positive: Monitor serum ALT and HBV DNA by PCR at monthly in tervals to 6 months post transplant. Thereafter HBV DNA by PCR anytime at onset of abnormal or worsening serum ALT. 2) Treatment For patients at risk for HBV infection afte r transplant who are NOT receiving antiviral prophylaxis, we recommend initiation of antivir al treatment with entecavir when HBV DNA is first detected after transplant. The ai m of antiviral treatment is to suppress viral replication completely, thereby minimizing the risk of viral mutation. Patients should be treated for 12 months or 6 months after discontinuation of syst emic immunosuppressive treatment, whichever is longer. 3) Other considerations -Clearance of antigenemia is commonly obs erved and is particul arly likely if the hematopoietic cell donor was anti-HBs-positive. - Based on CDC guidelines, vaccination with H AV is considered particularly important and is strongly recommended for any patient with evidence of infection with HBV to prevent the development of fulminant liver fa ilure secondary to he patitis A infection. (See section IX Vaccinations) B. Hepatitis C Infection with HCV virus is more frequent in patients who received blood product transfusions before 1991 when HCV testing was unavailable than with transfusions given after 1991. The prevalence of chronic hepatitis C in long-term HCT survivors ranges from 5% to 70%, depending on the endemic prevalence. Long-te rm survivors with HCV infection commonly have fluctuating levels of AST and ALT. During the first 10 ye ars after infection, hepatitis C has little impact in morbidity or mortalit y\u2014with the exception possibly of HCV-infected patients who are receiving MMF. The frequency of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease caused by Hepatitis C in 40-year survivors of hema topoietic cell transplant is about 33%. Regardless of whether HCV infection occurred be fore or after the tran splant, clinical or biochemical evidence of hepatitis usually coincides with the return of cellular immunity and the tapering of immunosuppressive drugs used for GVHD prophylaxis. During this time, it is difficult to differentiate the hepatitic vari ant of GVHD of the liver from an exacerbation of HCV. The presence of hepatitis C viremia, ev en in high titer, is in sufficient to make the distinction between these two disorders. The absence of hepatitis C viremia, however, 78means that HCV is not a cause of ALT elevat ions. Unless there is evidence of active GVHD in other organs, a liver biopsy may be required before a therapeutic decision is made. Pathologic distinction between hepatitis C a nd GVHD may be difficult, since both processes may be associated with portal lymphoid infilt ration and bile duct inju ry. Marked bile with epithelial cell dropout and loss of interlobular bile ducts is more typical of GVHD. A flare of hepatitis C and hepatic GVHD may occur simultaneously. If the liver biopsy suggests both processes, immunosuppressive therapy s hould be administered, since ongoing lymphocytic attack leading to loss of in terlobular bile ducts may result in severe and progressive cholestasis. Fulminant immune-rebound hepatitis C has been reported only rarely af ter withdrawal of immunosuppression. Patients infected by HCV w ho are receiving MMF may be at risk to develop fatal fibrosing cholestati c hepatitis C. The role of an tiviral agents, especially new polymerase and protease inhibi tors specific for HCV, has not been defined in this circumstance. After the initial flare of hepa titis during immune reconstitution, the serum ALT levels may again return to normal, but laboratory abnormalities often settle into the pattern of chronic hepatitis seen in other pati ents with HCV infection. Anti-viral therapy for chronic HCV infection should be considered after the patient has discontinued all immunosuppressive drugs and has no evidence of active GVHD. Current studies are examining the use of combination antiviral dr ugs therapy for chronic HCV infection that do not include interferons as part of therapy; these regimens could be potentially useful for patients with chronic GVHD plus HCV infecti on, in whom avoidance of interferon therapy would be desirable. (see Re ferences, section XXV, Liver) Monitoring: Liver function tests at le ast weekly to day 100, then bimonthly until 1 year HCV RNA should be checked around day 50 post transplant in thos e rare patients who were HCV antibody positive but HCV RNA ne gative pretransplant or whose donor was HCV RNA positive. Repeated testing for HCV RNA is not necessary once the diagnosis of HCV infection has been established. Patients known to have HCV should be referred to a hepatologist to assess three major issues: 1) Has the virus infection caused any da mage to the liver yet? 2) Are there other causes of liver damage (i.e., alcohol, medications, chroni c GVHD, hemosiderosis or the hepatitis B virus? 3) Should medi cations for HCV be instituted? Therapy Antiviral therapy should be considered in any long-term HCT survivor with chronic hepatitis C infection. Interferon-alfa and ribavirin can be administered to patients who have discontinued treatment with all immunosuppressive agents and have no evidence of GVHD or myelosuppression. Treatment with th ese agents may cause thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and exacerbation of GVHD. While experience is limited, response rates to interferon-alfa and ribavirin a ppear to be no different from those of other patients with hepatitis C. However, newer antiviral drugs active against HCV are in development, and 79it is likely that combination antiviral drug ther apy will be much more effective than older interferon/ribavirin regimens. (see References, section XXV, Liver)` In patients with concomitant iron overloa d, phlebotomy or chelation therapy may be indicated to reduce hepatic iron stores (Section XVIII) before interferon therapy; mobilization of liver iron may increase the chance of response. The mobilization of iron after transplant largely depends on the iron bur den, especially cardiac iron. A review of this topic has been published. (see References, section XXV, Liver) Other Considerations: - Based on CDC guidelines, vaccination against HAV and HBV are considered particularly important and are strongly recommended for any patient with evidence of infection with HCV to prevent the developmen t of fulminant liver failure secondary to infection with other hepatitis viruses. (See section IX Vaccinations) 80 XIX. IRON OVERLOAD Iron overload occurs frequently after the transplant, often caused by ineffective erythropoiesis with associated intestinal hypera bsorption, in addition to red cell transfusions and, in some patients, genetic hemochromatosis. Relatively little is known about the effects of iron overload in HSC transplant patients ot her than those with hemoglobinopathies. Other patients with hepatic iron overl oad in the range of 3200 to 7000 g/g dry weight have normal life expectancy. Extrem e tissue iron overload (> 15,000 g/g dry weight) has been associated with extensive organ toxicity in the posttransplant survivors of thalassemia. Principal organs at risk include the heart, liver, pancreas a nd pituitary gland, resulting in dysrhythmias and cardiac cirrhosis, insuli n-dependent diabetes mellitus and other endocrine insufficiencies. In patients with chronic hepatitis C, iron overload may accelerate the development of cirr hosis. Once transplant has restored normal hematopoieses and red cell transfusions are no longer required, body iron stores decline over several years [Angelucci, Lancet 1993]. Mobilization of iron in heavily overloaded patients improves cardiac function, normalizes serum ALT levels, and results in improved liver histology [Angelucci, Blood 1997; Mariotti, BJH, 1998]. Liver or marrow iron content correlates poorly with number of transfused red blood cell units. Marrow and hepatic iron content has b een determined by spectrophotometry among 10 consecutive autopsied patients who were tran splanted for hematological malignancy. The median hepatic iron content (HIC) at 50 to 100 days posttransplant was 4307 g/g dry weight (range 1832-13120; normal 530-900) a nd the median marrow iron content was 1999 /g dry weight (range 932-3942). Marrow ir on content can also be measured by morphometry based on digital photomicrographs of a Prussian blue-stained marrow biopsy. Because of correlation between morphometric and spectrophotometric analyses of marrow iron content (r = 0.8, P= 0.006) and hepatic ir on index (r = 0.82, P = 0.004) morphometric analysis of marrow iron content is an acceptable alternative for quantifyi ng tissue iron stores [Strasser, BMT 1998]. Earlier work also demonstated a close relationship between biochemical concentration and histologic grad ing of marrow iron [Gal e et al 1963] although histological grading is subject to variation between and within observers [Cavill 1982]. Because the carrier frequency for homozygous HF E gene mutations is relatively high (0.3 to 0.5%) among individuals of northern and wester n European extraction, the possibility of genetic hemochromatosis contributing to posttrans plant iron overload needs to be considered in relevant individuals. Two point mutati ons, C282Y (Cys282Tyr) and H63D (His63Asp), have been described within the HFE gene. Homozygosity for C282Y is associated with haemochromatosis; the effect of compound he terozygosity (C282Y/H63D)) on iron status in HCT recipients is variable [Grigg et al, 2001]. Individuals Particularly at risk for Iron Overload Hemoglobinopathies (Sickle Cell Disease, Thalassemia major) Congenital Anemia (e.g., Diamond-Blackfan) Hereditary Hemochromatosis Chronic Anemia with transfusional ove rload and ineffective erythropoiesis Hepatitis C ma y accelerate siderosis-induced hepatic damage 81 A. Evaluation of Iron Overload after HSC Transplant 1. Bone Marrow Measurement of marrow iron by morphometry or spectrophotometry is appropriate to assess iron stores in most cases. 2. Serum Iron Studies and Liver function tests if > 2 in grade in B one Marrow, at 80-100 days post transplant, 1 year post transplant or at increased ri sk for iron overload. Transferrin Saturation (TS) Serum Serum Ferritin HFE genotype should be considered in patients with a family member with HC and in patients with Transferrin Saturati on (TS) > 45% in patients of Northern or Western European ethnicity. 3. Assessment of Iron Stores in Tissues Indications Assessment of Iron Stores is indicated in patients with Transferrin Saturation (TS) > 45% with either a ferritin level > 1000 or abnormal ALT and in patients with TS > 45% with HFE wild type with either ferritin levels > 2500 or abnormal ALT. Measurement of hepatic iron by spectropho tometry of liver biopsy is the gold standard for testing and is preferred for patients with markedly elevated serum ferritin and ALT (especially if HFE homozygous or com pound heterozygous). In addition, these samples should be reviewed for liver pathology (e.g., portal fibrosis, cirrhosis, or hepatitis). While measurement of liver iron concentr ation is the gold standard, an iron- specific magnetic resonance imaging test (Ferriscan) is highly accurate in measuring liver iron and is an alternative to liver biopsy for the measurement of hepatic iron content. 4. Indication for Iron Mobilization Therapy A ccording to Tissue Iron Content Hepatic Iron Content (g/g dry weight) Marrow Iron Content Mobilization of Iron >15000 Very high ++++ Phlebotomy + Desferoxamine 7000 - 15000 1st Desferoxamine or Desferasirox (especially if HCV+) <7000 Not increased or mildly increased + 1) HFEwildtype: observe 2) HFEC282Y/C282Y or C282Y/H63D: Phlebotomy 82 B. Phlebotomy after Transplant If indicated, phlebotomy is lik ely to be the safest and most cost-effective approach for the mobilization of tissue iron. Regular phlebotomy requires normal hematopoi esis or hematopoiesis that can respond satisfactorily to weekly or every-other-week erythropoietic stimulating agents. Phlebotomy Regimen: Phlebotomy volume 5 mL/kg as tolerated Frequency every 3-4 weeks as tolerated Monitoring monthly ferritin, iron and % iron saturation Discontinue Phlebotomy ferriti n falls below 500-1000 ng/mL Erythropoietic Stimulating Agents may be ad ministered subcutaneously to facilitate regular phlebotomy. The smallest number of wh ole vials should be prescribed per dose: Weight (kg) Erythropoietin1 (Units weekly) Darbepoetin2 (micrograms every-other-week) 10-14 6000 to 8000 25 to 60 15-20 10000 60 21-24 10000 to 14000 60 to 100 25-29 14000 100 30-39 20000 100 40-60 40,000 200 >60 Use darpopoetin 200 Erythropoeitin (Epogen) vial sizes (2000, 4000, 10000, 20000, 40000 units) 2 Darbepoetin (Aranesp) vial si zes (25, 60, 100, 150, 200, 300 micrograms) C. Chelation Therapy If phlebotomy cannot be performed despite the use of erythropoietic stimulating agents within 3 - 6 months after tran splantation, and if treatment to mobilize iron stores is indicated, iron chelation therapy with desferoxa mine (Desferal) or deferasirox (Exjade) should be initiated. 1. Desferoxamine (Desferal) Iron overload increases the susceptibility of pa tients to Yersinia enterocolic and Yersinia pseudotubera infections. In rare cases, treatm ent with desferoxamine has enhanced this susceptibility, resulting in generalized inf ections by providing this bacteria with a siderophore otherwise missing. Rare infecti ons with mucormycosis have also been reported in association with desferoxamine . Desferoxamine can be administ ered by continuous subcutane ous or intravenous infusion. Desferoxamine causes less toxicity if administered subcutaneously. The daily dose of deferoxamine (Desferal) should be 20 to 40 mg/kg subcutaneously, administered at least five days per wee k. The dose should not exceed 50 mg/kg and the infusion rate should not exceed 15 mg/ kg/hour in order to avoid hypotension. 83Desferoxamine is administer ed parenterally by continuous overnight infusion with ambulatory pumps. Plasma concentra tions reach a plateau at 12 hours. Most of the toxicity caused by desferoxamine occurs when the dose exceeds 50 mg/kg or when the iron burden is not high. Toxic effects caused by desferoxamine incl ude ocular and auditory abnormalities, sensorimotor, neurotoxicity, re nal insufficiency, pulmonary t oxicity, and failure of linear growth. Toxicity can be avoided by regular assessment of the body iron stores. Patients receiving desferoxamine should have annual measurem ent of total body iron (liver biopsy or another suitable measure). In general, direct assessment of body ir on stores should also follow when desferoxamine toxicity occurs. If hepatic iron content is <3000 mcg/gm dry liver weight, or marrow iron content is not increased or only mildly increased, treatment with desferoxamine should be discontinued for six months. Thereafter, the dose of desf eroxamine should be adjusted to maintain hepatic iron content between 3000 a nd 7000 mcg/gm dry liver weight. Suggested monitoring of desferoxamine -related toxicity is shown below. Toxicity Tests Frequency Alteration In Rx High frequency sensorineural hearing loss Audiogram Annually; if symptomatic, check immediately Stop desferoxamine; repeat audiogram at 3 month intervals until normal or stable Retinopathy (pigmentairy degenaration); cataracts; corneal opacities; visual visual acuity, slit-lamp and fundoscopy Annually; if symptomatic, check immediately Stop desferoxamine if retinopathy or hearing impairment Metaphyseal/Spinal Plain x-ray of wrists, knees, spine; bone age in children Annually Reduce desferoxamine to 25 mg/kg/day Growth retardation Sitting and standing height Every 6 months Reduce desferoxamine to 25 mg/kg/day; reassess every 6 months 2. Deferasirox (Exjade) Deferasirox is an oral medica tion for It is available in 125mg, 250mg, and 500mg tablets. The starting dose of deferasirox is 20mg/kg/day. The dose of deferasirox may be adjusted in 5-10mg/kg/day increments every 3-6 months if necessary depending on serum ferritin trends. Doses of deferasirox should not exceed 30m g/kg/day. Therapy should be temporarily discontinued if the serum ferriti n level falls below 500mcg/L. Deferasirox should be taken once daily on an empt y stomach (at least 30 min prior to eating). Tablets should be completely disp ersed by stirring in water, ora nge juice, or apple juice until there is a fine suspension. Doses <1 gram should be dispersed in 3.5 ounces of liquid, and doses 1 gram should be dispersed in 7 ounces of liquid. After swallowing, any residue 84should be resuspended in a small volume of liquid and swallowed. Doses should be separated by 2 hours from al uminum containing antacids. Dosing of deferasirox should be reduced for re nal dysfunction. If the serum creatinine level increases more than 33% over the course of tw o consecutive visits, the dose of deferasirox should be reduced by 10mg/kg. For pediatric patients, the dose should be reduced by 10mg/kg if the serum creatinine is greater th an the upper limit of normal on 2 consecutive visits. Toxicities of deferasirox incl ude GI symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain), headaches, pyrexia, skin rash, increases in serum and ophthalmic disturbances. Post marketing surveillance has shown cases of acute renal failure or cytopenias with fatal outcomes in patients taking deferasirox. The relation to deferasirox in these cases is uncertain. Serum ferritin levels should be monitored every month while on deferasirox. Serum creatinine, urine protein levels, CBCs, and liver function tests should be checked at baseline and at least monthly while on therapy. Patient s with pre-existing renal dysfunction or other risk factors should be monitored with weekly serum creatinine levels for at least the first month, and then monthly thereafter. Base line auditory and ophthalmic testing are recommended with regular follow up assessments every 12 months. 85 XX. VITAMINS AND OTHER MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS It is recommended that all allogeneic patie nts have iron-free multiple vitamin/mineral supplementation for one year or until all immunosuppressive ther apy is discontinued after the transplant. Autologous patients should conti nue supplementation for one year if dietary intake does not meet daily requirements. Iron supplementation should not be used routinely in any patient unless iron deficiency is clearly documented. Most pati ents have iron-overload because of red cell transfusions and increased absorption of iron in th e GI tract (see Section XIX). A. Calcium and Vitamin D daily intake requirements Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are ne cessary in order to decrease the risk of bone complications after transplant. Wome n with ovarian failure and patients who require long-term treatment w ith corticosteroids have a hi gh risk of osteoporosis, and pediatric patients can have poor bone devel opment after chemothera py and radiation. Avoidance of sunlight and the use of sunscr een to block UV radiat ion can contribute to vitamin D deficiency. Patients who cannot consume adequate calcium or vitamin D from foods should receive supplements to meet their daily requirements. Supplemental calcium should be given in divided doses, preferably as cal cium citrate. Some \"natural\" calcium supplements do not contain enough bioavailable calcium to prev ent osteopenia. The maximum amount that can be absorbed with each dose is 500 mg. See Section XI for prevention of osteoporosis in patients who are being tr eated with glucocorticoids. Daily requirements Age (years) Elemental Ca++ Vitamin D 1 - 5 800 mg 400 International Units 6 - 8 1200 mg 400 International Units 9 - 18 1500 mg 400 - 800 International Units >18 1500 mg 800 International Units B. Magnesium supplementation Cyclosporine and tacrolimus (FK-506) incr resulting in low serum magnesium levels. Hypomagnesemia has been associated with seizures in patients treated with cyclos porine or tacrolimus (FK506). All patients receiving magnesium supplementation and monitoring serum magnesium levels monthl y, or more often as indicated. Oral magnesium with protein (133 mg/tablet) is better tolerated than magnesium oxide. The magnesium requirements range from 6 to 20 or mo re tablets daily for adults and 1 to 9 or more tablets daily for children. Some patients may require intravenous supplementation (magnesium sulfate) if oral ad ministration causes diarrhea. 86 XXI. DIETS AND OTHER NUTRI TIONAL GUIDELINES A. Diet for immunosuppressed patients after transplant Patients after hematopoietic transplant or after high dose ch emotherapy are at increased risk of developing food-related infections . It is recommended th at all transplant recipients follow the nutrition guidelines for discharge home, including the Diet for Immunosuppressed Patients. Thes e guidelines can be found at www.seattlecca.org under patientsandfamilies/nutrition/nutritionDietsguidelines/ osteoporosisNutritionguidelines. The duration of immunosuppressed patient diet depends on the immunocompromised status of th e patient and the type of transplant, as described below: Allogeneic transplant recipients should fo llow the immunosuppressed patient diet guidelines until all immunosuppressive treatments are discontinued. Autologous transplant recipients should fo llow the immunosuppressed patient diet guidelines until one month after discontinuation of corticosteroids or three months after chemotherapy or transplant (whichever occurs later) and as long as there are no GI symptoms. B. Additional dietary recommendations: 1. Diet for patients receiving treatment with corticosteroids: In addition to the Diet for Immunosuppre ssed Patients, nutritional recommendations to minimize the risk of osteoporosis are n eeded (see Section XI). These nutritional guidelines can also be found at www.seattle cca.org/ patientsandf amilies/nutrition/ nutritionDietsguidelines/osteoporosisNutritionguidelines . 2. Diet for patients with graft-versus- host disease of gastrointestinal tract : In addition to the Immunosuppressed Patie nt Diet, specific diets are recommended for patients with GVHD of the GI tract to help alleviate th e gastrointestinal symptoms. Two different gastrointestinal diets (GI1 and GI2) have been developed by the dietitians at the FHCRC and the S CCA. These GI1 and GI2 diets have limited amounts of fats, fiber, lactose, acidic items and GI irritants. The diets can be found at www.seattlecca.org under patientsandfamilies/nutrition/nutritionDietsguidelines/. For patients with severe diarrhea (ex ceeds 8-10 ml/kg/day) or significant crampy abdominal pain, bowel rest (NPO) is recommended. TPN at 1.5 x basal energy needs or higher, 1.5-2.0 g protein/kg with suppl emental zinc is also usually needed. Replacement of stool losses on a mL/mL basis with half-normal saline hydration is recommended. As diarrhea subsides, the respon se to oral feeding is highly variable. 87When oral intake is appropriate, we reco mmend beginning with is otonic beverage in small amounts and gradually progressing to th e GI1 diet and subsequently to the GI2 diet as tolerated (see Table next page). GVHD of the upper intestine or stomach ma y present only as anorexia, nausea, and early satiety. High-fat foods are gene rally poorly tolerated. Empiric lactose restriction should be considered. Patients may find it easier to meet energy and protein needs with nutritional supplements sipped continuously throughout the day. 88Gastrointestinal GVHD Diet Progression* Phase Symptoms Diet Diet Intolerance 1.

Introduction of oral feeding Minimal GI cramping Diarrhea less than 500 ml/day Guaiac-negative stools Improved transit time (minimum 1.5 hours) Infrequent nausea and vomiting Oral: isosmotic, low-residue, low-lactose beverages, initially 60 ml every 2-3 hours, for several days IV: as for Phase 1 Increased stool volume or diarrhea Increased emesis Increased abdominal Cramping 3. Introduction of solids Minimal or no GI cramping Formed stool Oral: allow introduction of solid food, once every 3-4 hours: minimal lactosea, low fiber, low fat (20-40 gm/day)b, low total acidity, no gastric irritants IV: as for Phase 1 As in Phase 2 4. Expansion of diet Minimal or no GI cramping Formed stool Oral: minimal lactosea, low fiber, low total acidity, no gastric irrita nts; if stools indicate fat malabsorption: low fatb IV: as needed to meet nutritional requirements As in Phase 2 5. Resumption of regular diet No GI cramping Normal stool Normal transit time Normal albumin Oral: progress to regular diet by introducing one restricted food per day: acid foods with meals, fiber-containing foods, lactose-containing foods. Order of addition will vary, depending on individual tolerances and preferences. Patients no longer exhibiting steatorrhea should have the fat restriction liberalized slowly IV: discontinue when oral nutritional intake meets estimated needs As in Phase 2 aLactose is one of the last disaccharidases to return following villous atrophy. A commercially-prepared lactose solution (Lact aidR) is used to reduce the lactose content of milk by >90%. LactaidR milk (100% lactose-free) is also commercially available. b Additional calories may be provided by commercially available medium chain triglycerides which do not exacerbate symptoms. *Adapted from Darbinian J, Schubert MM.

NATUROPATHIC AND NUTRIENT SUPPLEMENT PREPARATIONS Herbal/botanical preparations should not be given duri ng immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with chronic GVHD. One month after discontinuation of all systemic immunosuppressive treatment and resolution of manifestations of chronic GVHD, herbal/botanical prep aration may be given at th e discretion of the primary physician. Autologous transplant patients: Herbal/botanical preparations should not be given until complete recovery of any gastrointestinal toxicity a nd until prednisone therapy has been discontinued for one month. Further information regarding guidelines for the use of herbal and nutrient supplement preparations can be found at www.seattlecca.org under patientsandfamilies/nuritionDietsguidelines, Guidelines for herbal & nutrient supplements during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and high-dose chemotherapy . 90XXIII. RETURN TO SEATTLE FOR LONG -TERM FOLLOW-UP EVALUATION All adults who have had an allogeneic transp lant and all children w ho have had either an allogeneic or autologous tran splant should return to the FHCRC/SCCA for a comprehensive evaluation at one year after the transplant . Depending on clinical indications, follow-up evaluations at subsequent inte rvals may be arranged. Children should return for subsequent evaluations at 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, a nd 20 years after the transplant. These evaluations focus on hematologic and immunologic function, assessmen t of the original disease, and thorough screening for any late transplant complications . The LTFU evaluation requires four to five working days to complete. A detailed summa ry of findings and recommendations will be forwarded to the referring physician. Appointment s must be scheduled at least 4 months in advance by calling the LTFU office assistant at (206) 667-4415 or by sending a FAX to 1-800-376-8197 (toll-free, USA and Canada). TYPE OF TRANSPLANT TIME TO RETURN FOR COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION Allogeneic (ADULT) Autologous (ADULT) One year after the transplant One year after the transplant based on protocol, patient or physician request Follow-up evaluations at other times per protocol or as clinically indicated Allogeneic & Autologous (PEDIATRIC) One year, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 years after the transplant 91XXIV. HOW TO SEND SPECIMENS FOR TESTING AT FHCRC / SCCA Clinical laboratory testing for patients who r eceived treatment at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center / Seattle Cancer Care A lliance (FHCRC / SCCA) is available at the FHCRC/SCCA. The tests most often performed in our laboratories at the request of referring physicians include BCR/abl transcripts by pol ymerase chain reaction of variable number tandem repeat polymorphisms. We ask that you notify the LTFU office by telephone at (206) 667-4415 or by FAX (Appendix A) to indicate the expect ed date and time of arrival for specimens that are sent for testing at the FHCRC / SCCA. The LTFU office will provide detailed instructions regarding sample collection and shipment informa tion for the specific test(s) requested. If surgery or biopsy is planned for evalua tion of suspected secondary malignancy or recurrence of disease, please contact our LTF U office before the procedure, whenever possible. Guidelines for Sending Clinical Specimens 1. Call the LTFU office at (206) 667-4415 be fore sending the specimen (Appendix A). 2. Do not send fresh / frozen samples to arrive on Fridays, weekends or government holidays. 3. Ship the specimen via an overnight courier service on the day the samples were obtained. 4. Label each tube with Patient's name Patient's social security number (if not available, date of birth) Date that the sample was obtained Type of specimen (i.e., peripheral blood, bone marrow, serum, left breast mass, etc.) 5. Please complete Test Request Forms that will be faxed to you by our office 6. SAMPLE(S) MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE SCCA TEST REQUEST FORM S 7. Shipment charges are the responsibility of the patie nt or the facility send ing the sample. A study coordinator will forward shipment instru ctions to patients who are enrolled in specific protocols that require samples to be sent to the FHCRC / SCCA for research studies. 92XXV.
