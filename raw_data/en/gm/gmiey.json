One of the main tenets of natural medicine is improving the quality of the foods we eat. At times, our doctors will recommend minor changes to food choices that can produce health and wellness. In other instances, more specific changes such as the [SIBO diet](https://terrainwellness.com/sibo-diet/), moving away from inflammatory foods and other more significant changes may be needed. At the end of the day, we believe in nourishing foods that support health and strength. Learning the \"Terrain\" that makes up who you are is a lifelong process that involves everything from what types of foods work best with your personal health all the way to the kinds of activities that expand your spirit and personality. Portland natural medicine and acupuncture is more than just medical treatments, this is a lifestyle of moving toward a greater knowing of the self allows us to have healthier lives and more rewarding interactions with others. We look forward to helping you map out your own terrain and discovering more about yourself through acupuncture, applied kinesiology and naturopath services. Rather than alleviating various symptoms, our role as Naturopath in Portland means that we believe a better way forward often lies in increasing self-awareness and finding out what supports greater health and wellbeing. IV Therapy in Portland, Oregon Terrain Wellness proudly offers [IV Therapy](https://terrainwellness.com/primary-care-medicine/iv-therapy/) (Intravenous Nutritional Therapy) for established patients at our Portland clinic. Our doctors prescribe IV Therapy on a case-by-case basis after reviewing relevant health information with the patient. Providing excellent medical care (including IV Therapy) that is custom-tailored for you and your nutritional needs means that we only offer IV as a treatment modality to patients when it is deemed medically beneficial. Prior to prescribing IV Nutritional Therapy, our doctors will review the patient's current/past medications and allergies, screen for health conditions which may contraindicate IV Therapy and review lab tests as appropriate. Our physicians' vetting process with patients helps insure that our IV Nutrition, glutathione pushes, B-Complex, B-12 injections, methyl cobalamine (an activated form for patients with MTHFR genetic variants) and many other minerals are indicated for your health conditions and relevant to your specific wellness goals. Rather than having off-the-shelf products like the well-known Meyer's Cocktail (a common IV for Cold & Flu recovery), we customize our IV treatments specifically to you. Thank you to our wonderful patients. "}
