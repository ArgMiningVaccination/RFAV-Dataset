to Fyodor Dostoevsky, Sir Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela whose observations link the conditions of a society's correctional centres and the treatment of offenders to the character of that society. While the issues of conditions and treatment are rightly the province of inspection, a more fundamental question which impacts on conditions and treatment is who it is whose liberty is taken by the State and is the subject of the custodial experience. The answer to this question focuses attention on the profile and size of the inmate population which are physical manifestations of the failures of wider public policies, over which the correctional agencies have little influence and with which it has to contend. Community knowledge of and confidence in the correctional system is significantly influenced by its transparency. Conversely, where what happens behind correctional centre walls is opaque to inquiry, community confidence is undermined. If the community is to be engaged, and it should be, in the management of inmates and correctional centres, it needs to be informed. But the public's comprehension of corrections has long been undermined by misinformation, disinformation and prejudice and simply by the closed nature of correctional centres which has tended to privilege security over all other considerations. Correctional systems also tend to be self-referential, which means that root-and-branch reform is rarely generated internally, but is rather the product of external intervention, where the outside is brought into the correctional system or centre. In the history of NSW corrections, this has usually been a product of some crisis or manifest failure, such as that documented in the 1978 Royal Commission into New South Wales Prisons. This is not to deny that correctional agencies, with the right leadership and with political support, are quite capable of making internal changes and systems improvement on their own volition. The advent of formal announced and unannounced inspections and reporting to Parliament by an independent inspection body represents an important contribution to giving members of the community and their parliamentary representatives confidence in the care and custody of inmates and how correctional centres are being managed in their collective name. The publication of the New South Wales Inspection Standards ensures the consistency and transparency of these inspections. The Inspection Standards has drawn upon a range of international and domestic treaties, covenants, instruments, standards and research. These have included the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Inmates, European Prison Rules and the Standards of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT). It has also drawn upon the UK Prison Service's \"Decency Agenda\" and Her Majesty's Inspector of Prisons' Healthy Prisons test and Expectations and relevant research, including that of the Institute of Criminology, University of Cambridge into the development and application of the Measurement of the Quality of Prison Life (MQPL) and the Staff Quality of Life (SQL). The Inspection Standards has also been informed by the national correctional reporting framework, reports of the Ombudsman, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and the Coroner, relevant NSW legislation, regulations and the Standard Guidelines for Corrections in Australia 2012. In particular, it has been inspired by and owes much to the Western Australian Inspector of Custodial Services' Code of Expectation Standards, on which it is based. Finally, the development of Inspection Standards has been complemented by observed policy and practice in the delivery of custodial services in NSW. The Inspection Standards is thus founded on an approach which is considerably broader than an inevitably limited human rights-based approach.Inspection standards for adult custodial services in New South Wales6 7 Inspection standards for adult custodial services in New South WalesThe publication of the Inspection Standards ensures visibility for custodial management and staff and the community of the operational standards on which inspection consistently will be based. It is thus part of a quality regime which fosters the continuous improvement of custodial services in NSW. The basis of the Inspection Standards lies in the principles of independent inspection, accountability, prevention, purposeful and rehabilitative imprisonment, and the protection of human rights. Independent inspection International human rights instruments call for the regular inspection of correctional and detention centres by 'a competent authority distinct from the authority directly in charge of the administration of the place of detention or imprisonment.' This is simply a recognition of the need to ensure the integrity and credibility of the inspection process and its outcomes by ensuring that there is no \"capture\" of the inspecting body by the agency being inspected. Accountability In correctional centres there is a considerable power imbalance between staff and inmates, and the potential for abuse is always present. Consequently, there is a heightened requirement for accountability and transparency in the way that correctional centres and inmates are managed to prevent abuse and to protect a wider range of human rights - this is the primary function of independent custodial inspection. The Inspection Standards is also concerned with the accountability of the Inspector: it makes it clear what are the values of the Inspector, what it is that will be inspected and on what evidence independent judgement will be exercised. Prevention Accountability processes frequently only are initiated after an incident or on completion of an inquiry, by which time damage may have been done to inmates, staff and to families and facilities. The history of such events in NSW suggests that the momentum for change generated by a significant incident and its associated inquiry dissipates over time, until the next similar incident. Thus inspection is very much concerned with prevention and should operate well upstream from other regulatory agencies, such as the Ombudsman and ICAC. Purposeful and rehabilitative imprisonment The notion of rehabilitative imprisonment is firmly grounded in the belief that people can change. Imprisonment consequently provides opportunities and support for change through reflection, learning, behavioural change and skill improvement. While imprisonment is a last resort mechanism for protecting society from crime, most inmates will be released back to the community. The longer-term protection of society consequently requires a focus on inmate rehabilitation and preparation for release to ensure, so far as practicable, that released inmates are both able and motivated to lead a law abiding and self-supporting life. Correctional centres also provide the opportunity for inmates to make reparation for the harm done by their offending. Indeed, keeping inmates idle is both destructive to the human spirit and increases the risk of unrest. Imprisonment should therefore seek to provide a wide range of constructive activity for inmates that will keep them meaningfully occupied.Human rights I Inmates' fundamental human rights are not forfeited because of their imprisonment and are in fact limited only in so far as is demonstrably necessitated by the fact of imprisonment. Modern correctional centres are institutions of the civil society and inmates do not cease to be its members, regardless of the seriousness of the crime they may have committed. Consequently, inmates must always 'be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.' While considerable emphasis is placed on the requirement for compliance with human rights standards, the observance of human rights is integral to good correctional centre management and the most effective and safest way of managing correctional centres. The best argument for observing human rights standards is not merely that they are required by international or domestic law, but rather a human rights-based approach is simply sound correctional practice, which good correctional staff have long followed, even if not under that banner. In the broad, inspection under the Inspection Standards seeks to determine whether the element of the Custodial Centre or Service being inspected, in summary, contributes to the Healthy Prison, which has four elements, as follows: Safety: inmates, even the most vulnerable, are held safely. Respect: inmates are treated with respect for their human dignity. Purposeful activity: inmates are able, and expected, to engage in activity that is likely to benefit them. Resettlement: inmates are prepared for release into the community, and helped to reduce the likelihood of their re-offending. Finally, it is recognised that Healthy Prisons will not be created and sustained by international covenants and standards, human rights law, by court decisions, nor by this Inspection Standards. The key to the realisation of this will be inspirational leadership and the professional execution of their duties by men and women of demonstrated integrity, intelligence and competence. Corrective Services NSW and Justice Health & Forensic Mental Health Network has been consulted during the development of the Inspection Standards. However, the Inspection Standards remain the Inspector's code. It is the view of the Inspector that to develop joint standards, so that correctional centres could be both managed and inspected against mutually agreed standards would be to reduce inspections to an audit function and would negate the value of independent inspection and the exercising of independent judgement. To ensure their continuing relevance and identify possible gaps within it, the Inspection Standards will be examined as part of each inspection. Inspector of Custodial Services July 2014Inspection standards for adult custodial services in New South Wales8 9 Inspection standards for adult custodial services in New South WalesIntroduction - Inspection and the objectives of imprisonment Imprisonment is the most severe criminal justice sanction that may be imposed in Australia. An order for the imprisonment of an individual requires that they be placed in the custody of a legally constituted authority and, unless otherwise authorised, confined in a correctional centre. The punishment inherent in imprisonment is the loss of freedom itself and no more. Inmates are to be managed and contained in a safe, secure and humane manner. Indeed, an order for imprisonment imposes upon the authority administering the order a duty of care with regard to ensuring the safety and well being of the person in custody as well as taking a proper risk management approach to preventing the person from harming themselves or others, as well as preventing escape. To further understand the objectives of imprisonment it is necessary to distinguish between the imprisonment of unsentenced and sentenced inmates. Remand or unsentenced inmates The court may determine for a number of reasons that an accused person be remanded in (committed to) custody until the matter may be brought to trial or until the person's guilt or innocence is determined, or in some circumstances until the conditions of bail can be met. The purpose of such remand imprisonment is therefore to ensure their availability and readiness for their next court appearance while ensuring that they pose no danger to themselves or others. By law, remand inmates are accorded a presumption of innocence and the conditions of custody and treatment of remand inmates should reflect this presumption of innocence. Remand inmates should therefore be assisted to prepare for their trial, meet any bail conditions that would enable their release on bail, maintain contact with relatives and friends, maintain their community accommodation and employment, and get help with pressing personal problems. Their conditions of imprisonment should not be less than is provided for sentenced inmates, including being entitled to access general health services and participate in work, education, recreational activities, and religious observance. Remand inmates should be kept separated from sentenced inmates unless they waive the right to such separation, and in the opinion of the correctional centre it is safe for them to do so. Remand inmates should be given opportunities for work and development but should not be 'required' to work or undertake programs addressing their offending. Nonetheless, a period of remand imprisonment provides an opportunity that should not be missed for inmates to review their personal situation and the correctional centre should facilitate and assist this process. Consequently, within the bounds of the allocation of scarce resources and the duty of care owed to inmates, it makes sense to offer awareness and treatment programs to inmates, particularly for inmates with drug or alcohol problems. Finally, the administering authority's duty of care for the management of these inmates must be based upon an assessment of all of the risks associated with managing each individual inmate. Full account should be taken of the seriousness of the charges that have been made against them and any previous history of offending or other known risk factors. Under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) a correctional centre sentence serves multiple purposes: it serves to punish an offender; it acts as a deterrent to the offender and others; for the period that it incapacitates it prevents the offender from committing other offences; it protects society; and it is to reform or rehabilitate the offender. However, given that the punishment aspect of a sentence is determined by the court through the length of the sentence, and that imprisonment does not imply, entail or empower any other punishment, humiliation, or cruel or unusual treatment of a person in a correctional centre other than the deprivation of freedom itself, correctional centres should not adopt punishment as an operationally useful purpose. Standard guidelines for corrections in Australia In 2004 all state and territory ministers for corrective services in Australia approved the revised Standard Guidelines for Corrections in Australia as constituting \"outcomes or goals to be achieved by correctional services...\" These standards were developed in accordance with nine principles that (in summary) relate to inmates being: treated with respect; owed a duty of care; managed fairly and without discrimination; managed in a graduated system of restriction based on risk; managed as individuals with recognition of diversity and special needs; kept active in a dynamic and structured environment with opportunity to make reparation; provided with opportunity to address offending behaviour and develop skills; accorded recognition for customary law, where appropriate; and prepared for release. These principles provide for the philosophy that underpins the Guidelines. However, the Guidelines may be seen to be in competition with each other and consequently, \"custodial administrators are not given a clear target.\" The number and complexity of the Guidelines leaves considerable room for operational interpretation, and in correctional centres the default setting is generally toward custody and security. This often means that good rehabilitative work or decent humanitarian management may be undermined the more security is privileged. Each inmate must be managed at the least level of security necessary to ensure safety, and the longer- term protection of society requires that inmates be treated with decency and humanity and that there be a focus on preparation for release to ensure, so far as practicable, that they are able and motivated to lead a law abiding and self-supporting life upon release. Correctional centres are essentially closed institutions into which few members of the community venture. Inmates are sent into these closed environments, and the complex and difficult task of managing them is given to staff, who under certain circumstances are empowered to use force to maintain order. Consequently, there is an elevated need for accountability and transparency in the way that correctional centres and inmates are managed. This means helping people to see into the correctional system and to understand what goes on. By so doing, it is made more difficult for anyone to act unfairly or corruptly, or for staff to be wrongly or unjustly accused or criticised. Thus public confidence and trust that correctional centres are being run properly may be increased. This is a major function of independent custodial inspections. Inspections also serve the public interest by seeking to ensure that the objectives of imprisonment are achieved, by seeking to raise the quality of correctional services so they become more professional, evidence-based, effective and more humane. All of this is directed at improving outcomes for inmates. It is necessary for inspections to exercise independent judgement on the nature of the experience of imprisonment as well as the material conditions of imprisonment as they impact on both staff and inmates. Inspections should also highlight good practice, where it occurs, as equally important to the ability to identify and report on deficiencies and areas for improvement. The Inspection Standards establish the inspection benchmarks for more effective, more accountable, and more humane correctional services.

There should be entry-level training for reception and admission processes and shift handover arrangements in reception facilities. 2.5 The vulnerability of inmates must be ascertained and appropriately safeguarded. This is particularly important for the first days in a correctional centre, but should also involve an assessment of longer-term safety and wellbeing through subsequent classification review. 2.6 The formal reception process must provide timely key information to inmates that enables them to understand their immediate rights and obligations under legislation and correctional centre rules. 2.7 If an inmate is illiterate, information should be conveyed orally. If an inmate does not speak English, an interpreter should be used. 2.8 Inmates should be advised about when they will receive an induction to the correctional centre. 2.9 Inmates should receive a structured and comprehensive induction to the correctional centre and its services 2.10 Newly admitted inmates, especially young inmates, (other than inmates transferred into minimum-security from another correctional centre) should be accommodated separately from the general population during the admission and induction process.

Of particular concern must be the detection of any self-harm or suicidal ideation. 3.1 Health screening must be undertaken by an appropriately qualified health professional. 3.2 All inmates with any indications of possible identified mental illness should be referred to Custodial Mental Health for assessment, referral and recommendations for suitable placement. These inmates must remain in the reception area until seen by required health services and should not be placed elsewhere. 3.3 Aboriginal inmates with any indications of possible identified mental illness must be reviewed by Mental Health Aboriginal workers. 3.4 Where the health professional conducting the assessment forms an opinion that the inmate's life or well-being are at risk, that opinion must be communicated to the appropriate correctional staff as soon as possible. Inmates identified as at risk of self-harm or suicide on reception are housed in a safe environment and reviewed daily.

A transparent, objective, and accurate assessment of security risks with regular reviews is essential to ensure safe custody of each inmate. As a general principle, inmates should be held at the lowest level of security appropriate to their individual circumstance. Consistent with the observation of human rights and in support of a rehabilitative custodial regime, inmates should be assigned to correctional centres as close as possible to their family, significant others, or community of interest. 10 CSNSW must have in place an accurate and transparent classification system that enables inmates to be individually assessed and placed into the lowest classification level commensurate with safety. 10.1 Inmates should be managed within a system that provides for graduated levels of restriction and security according to the risks posed by the inmate and, as far as practicable, the location of the community of interest of the inmate. 10.2 The classification system for inmates should be based upon an objective assessment of dangerousness, threat to order and security, risk of escape, criminogenic and other program needs and preparation for release. This system may include advice from other State and Commonwealth agencies. 10.3 Inmates should be made aware of the classification system and criteria in a way they can understand.

These tools include correctional centre design, construction and fit out, which must be evidence- based. Custodial infrastructure should contribute to achieving a balance between community protection and the safety, health and wellbeing of inmates, staff and visitors. Correctional centres must never be dilapidated, degrading or inhumane. Site layout, movements and building design should support a full range of service delivery and maximise opportunity for positive human interaction. The physical environment of correctional centres can be as important as the correctional centre regime in determining the correctional centre experience of inmates and staff. While personal safety and the maintenance of control are primary considerations in correctional centre design, poor correctional centre designs have also served to reinforce the isolation, sensory deprivation, powerlessness and alienation of inmates. Modern penological regimes are built upon interactive relations and correctional centre design should facilitate these interactions. Correctional centre design should support staff in the execution of their duties and not exacerbate stress over concerns for safety, security and well-being. Secure correctional centres should have perimeter barriers capable of deterring and withstanding a breach from inside and outside. However, neither maximum nor medium-security perimeter barriers should be designed to overpower the senses. A range of effective security systems and procedures should be established to complement the perimeter barrier system. Perimeter security arrangements must deter, detect and secure inmates from escape as well as minimise the introduction of contraband. Supporting Documentation EPR 51.1 17 Minimum security-correctional centres, transitional centres and pre-release centres that do not have perimeter barriers, or where these are open for part of the day, should have in place clear zoning and signs that indicate the limits of inmate and outsider access. 17.1 Where low or minimum-security fences and gates are constructed around minimum- security correctional centres, these should be supplemented by robust procedural and dynamic security measures. Supporting Documentation EPR 51.118 Internal buildings and static security measures should have regard for inmate, staff and visitor safety while 'normalising' the correctional centre environment, as far as practicable. 18.1 Reliance upon physical internal barriers should be minimised in favour of zoning by landscaping, building exteriors and prescribing particular areas for certain groups of inmates. 18.2 Officer posts must have mutually supporting sight lines and coverage of inmate movement routes. 18.3 All internal unsupervised inmate areas should be free of obvious ligature points. 18.4 Good lines of sight should be incorporated into all correctional centre design while retaining a human scale to all areas. Surveillance cameras in maximum and medium- security correctional centres should be used to supplement staff supervision; they complement, but do not replace, awareness. The use of surveillance technologies must not be at the expense of staff awareness. 18.5 Cell doors should be fitted with an access hatch that allows communication, and even the control of an inmate in certain defined circumstances, without opening the cell door. 18.6 Shared spaces should provide for levels of privacy, subject to safety. 18.7 Multiple occupancy accommodation should only be provided for inmates with appropriate risk and need profiles and who have agreed to such placements.

Such smaller arrangements provide a more human scale to buildings and reduce the anonymity and social isolation that comes from housing large groups of inmates together. 19.2 Preference should be for semi-autonomous units of up to 100 inmates, comprising small group living areas of around ten inmates or less, as small communities are better able to promote cooperation and responsible choice by inmates. 19.3 Living and accommodation units should be master planned to facilitate incentive management schemes appropriate to the inmate profile, and include self-care living, where practicable. 19.4 There are no clear international standards on cell size. 9sqm has been considered a satisfactory size for an individual cell and is now a de facto international norm. 19.5 Whether or not space is adequate depends upon if it is being shared, how many hours a day inmates are locked inside, whether they have in-cell access to shower and toilet and ambient temperatures. 19.6 Cell design should be consistent with recognised fire and safety standards. 19.7 Cells (except those in minimum security buildings) must be free of ligature points and their design should provide for inmate privacy, adequate fresh airflow, natural light, thermal comfort and serviceable emergency communications. 19.8 Multiple occupancy cells should provide adequate unencumbered space and privacy when toilets or ablutions are used. 19.9 Common rooms should provide sufficient seating and writing surfaces.

Consequently, correctional centre regimes must be open and accountable and provide genuine opportunities for inmates to voice concerns and make complaint. 47 Inmates must have an opportunity to make requests, lodge complaints and where these are not satisfactorily resolved, in a timely manner, be able to take matters to an independent competent authority, without being victimised. 47.1 An objective of good correctional centre management should be, as far as possible, to prevent serious complaints arising in the first place. This is best achieved through adhering to a set of fair and clear procedures that govern all aspects of correctional centre life and which are consistently applied. 47.2 These procedures should include a description of how inmates are able make requests and complaints, and how to take a complaint that is not (in their view) satisfactorily resolved by the correctional centre to an independent competent authority. The correctional centre should ensure accurate records are kept of complaints or grievances and response times for remedy. 47.3 Each correctional centre should establish a staff-inmate forum at which inmates can draw attention to issues of concern before they become the source of complaints. 47.4 As many complaints will concern staff, it is essential that inmates be assured that they will not be victimised or disadvantaged in making complaints locally or by seeking remedy through an independent competent authority. 47.5 There should also be a simple but confidential process (such as by free mail or free telephone) whereby inmates may make a complaint or representation to an external competent authority that has a mandate to respond to such complaints or representations. These authorities should include ICAC, the Ombudsman and the Healthcare Complaints Commission.

This includes the movement of inmates from courts to correctional centres, to taking inmates back and forth to medical appointments, and inter-correctional centre transfers. While the great majority of transports occur between metropolitan courts and correctional centres, a significant number involve movements between regions. There have been instances of ill-treatment and deaths in inmate and detainee transport in Victoria in 2004, New Zealand in 2006, Western Australia in 2008 and in New South Wales in 2009.

Supporting Documentation SMR 45(1) R-SGCA 1.87The treatment of inmates The first priority for managing inmates must be the embracing of a culture of human rights. A human rights culture must be as concerned with the rights of the individual as with the majority, with the rights of both inmates and staff, with the rights of the minority groups within correctional centres and the community. A human rights focus means that the management of inmates must be founded upon evidence-based assessments of individual risk and need. Inmates do not cease to be human beings simply because they are inmates, regardless of the crime they may have committed. As human beings, inmates are entitled to the same rights as every other person in Australia, except for those rights that may be expressly restricted by the fact of imprisonment. These rights are derived from a range of human rights treaties, covenants and other instruments that apply to all persons along with a number that are specific to inmates. Australia is a party to seven of the core human rights treaties. The starting point for these rights is the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights. The main principle guiding the rights of inmates is provided under article 10(3), which states: \"All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.\" The right to liberty is clearly severely limited by imprisonment; other rights such as the right to privacy, freedom of expression, freedom of movement and freedom of assembly are also limited as a consequence of imprisonment. However, these rights are restricted and curtailed, rather than completely withdrawn. It is important for the correctional centre to actively safeguard the human rights of inmates. 67 Inmates must be treated with respect for their inherent dignity as individual human beings. 67.1 Staff should be consistently fair and firm in their dealings with inmates and model respectful relations at all times. 67.2 Inmates should receive prompt attention to legitimate concerns.

Some of these children are able to be cared for by their fathers or other family members while others go into the foster care system. It is vital for babies in the first year of life to form a strong attachment to one person. From this grows a sense of security and trust, self-esteem and the capacity to love. The enforced separation of mothers and babies is often detrimental to the child and the mother, and consequently all correctional centres that hold women should have adequate facilities for babies and infants. 70 Children and infants should be allowed to reside with their mother and primary care giver in a correctional centre if it is in the best interest of the child to do so. 70.1 If a correctional centre provides for children and infants to reside with their primary care giver in a correctional centre, comprehensive and well-structured policies and programs should be developed where the interests of the children are paramount. 70.2 All such correctional centres must conform to the standards established by competent authorities particularly in the areas of safety, health, and with regard to the number and suitability of staff, as well as competent supervision. 70.3 It is the correctional centre's responsibility to ensure that all staff and volunteers that come into regular contact with children must possess a current Working With Children Check. 70.4 The accommodation for primary care givers and their children should, wherever possible be domestic, rather than custodial. 70.5 While inmates are responsible for the care of their children living in the correctional centre, the correctional centre must take reasonable steps to ensure a safe environment for children. 70.6 If it becomes necessary for the child to leave the care of the primary care giver, a separation management plan should be developed in consultation with the mother and the alternative caregiver. 70.7 During and following any separation process, the mother should be offered appropriate counselling.

Prison health care is not only provided in a complex environment but prison inmates are a complex, high-needs population. However, the correctional environment also provides a unique opportunity to improve the health status of a group who suffer poor health and may have minimal contact with health services in the community. The 2012 Standard Guidelines for Corrections in Australia Guideline 2.31 states \"Every prisoner is to have access to evidence-based health services provided by a competent, registered health professional who will provide a standard of health services comparable to that of the general community.\" The attainment of a \"community standard\" for this complex, high needs population inevitably involves a far greater disposition of resources than would be the case for a random cross-section of an equal number of people in the community across NSW. Correctional centres bring together people from various communities who are individually more in need of health services than average. The attainment of a \"community standard\" may only thus be realised by providing health resources allocated on the basis of need. This may be a greater need than that which is available to a similar sized community sample because a high needs population is concentrated in one place rather than being distributed randomly across the community. Most inmates will return to their communities so imprisonment provides an opportunity to improve both individual and public health. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) also highlights the importance of the health of prisoners for the occupational health and safety of the staff of correctional facilities. 76 The type of health care available to all inmates should reflect the health needs of the correctional centre population. 76.1 The correctional centre population, in particular its female and aged populous, has an abnormally high need for health services, therefore screening and treatment should reflect these needs. In particular inmates have been found to have a disproportionately high prevalence of: chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiac, respiratory and renal; mental health disorders; blood borne diseases, such as hepatitis C; alcohol, illicit drug and smoking disorders'; and dental disorders.

Inmates typically come from social groups that are disadvantaged in the community in terms of health and mental health care services, with a significant proportion having histories of alcohol, drug or other substance abuse and accumulated adverse life experiences. Further, the impact of imprisonment is likely to be stressful and potentially harmful to their mental and emotional health: isolation from family and social networks; loss of privacy; loss of personal control, identity and power to act; austere surroundings; and overt or covert aggression and bullying by other inmates. In addition, for many inmates there may be a lack of work or purposeful activity, heightened levels of uncertainty (particularly for remand inmates) and concerns about the outside world. 89 Correctional centres must make appropriate and adequate provision to meet the mental health care needs of inmates 89.1 An assessment of mental health should be made as part of the initial health screening required for all inmates upon entry into custody, or if a more in-depth assessment is to be made, this should occur within the first 30 days of custody. 89.2 Inmates who are suffering from a severe psychiatric illness should be assessed and transferred without delay so they may be managed by an appropriate tertiary or specialist health care facility, rather than a correctional centre.

However, inmates cannot be made to live and eat healthily, nor should they be.

If the correctional centre contains a sufficient number of inmates of the same religion, a qualified visiting representative of that religion should be able to be appointed or approved. 100.2 A qualified and approved religious representative should be allowed to hold regular services and to pay pastoral visits in private to inmates of the appropriate religion at the proper time, subject to the security and good order of the correctional centre. 100.3 Suitable multi-faith worship facilities should be available for inmates of all faiths. 100.4 The timing of religious services should be well advertised, and the timing of religious services should not clash with key regime activities. 100.5 Inmates should be able to obtain, keep and use books and objects of religious significance where this does not pose a risk to correctional centre security. 100.6 Approved religious books and objects are to be treated with respect. Staff should be provided with training to avoid inadvertent offence in this area. 100.7 Inmates should have access to religious publications, but religions should not seek to proselytise or convert inmates to a particular faith. 100.8 Inmates should not be permitted to assume the role of religious minister or representative. 100.9 Inmates should be able to celebrate major religious festivals. 100.10 Where practicable, recognised Indigenous elders or leaders should be permitted to address the emotional and spiritual needs of inmates. 100.11 Aboriginal spirituality should be encouraged and strengthened through the systematic observance of customs relating to language, food, death, healing, storytelling, rites of passage, tribal traditions and funeral attendance.

At minimum, inmates are to be allowed at least one hour of exercise and association in the open air each day. Importantly, recreational activities also provide many opportunities for the acquisition of skills that will assist inmates to adopt constructive lives. 101 Inmates should have reasonable access to a range of sports, recreation and cultural activities. 101.1 Inmates should be able to exercise in the open air for at least one hour every day, weather permitting. This standard is applicable to all inmates including those under protected or segregated custody. 101.2 The hours out of cells should facilitate this access to recreation (and to work, programs, services etc). To assess this, records of lock downs should be kept. Inmates accommodated in Mental Health Support Units should have increased time out of cell to facilitate their health needs. 101.3 The range of recreational activities available should reflect the various health and fitness needs of the most significant correctional centre population segments. 101.4 Particular consideration should be given to ensure equitable access and appropriateness of recreational opportunities for female inmates in predominantly male correctional centres. 101.5 Time allocated for the use of recreation facilities should not conflict with other aspects of the structured day. 101.6 Where it is not a risk to security, minimum-security rated inmates should be allowed to participate in structured recreational activities outside of the correctional centre. 101.7 Physical recreation and the playing of team games should be encouraged and facilitated with appropriate facilities and equipment. 101.8 Various passive recreation options should also be available. 101.9 In each recreational pursuit, inmates should be able to explore opportunities for acquiring skills and personal development.

Supporting Documentation EPR 27.4 R-SGCA 1.31Gratuities and money management The proper management of inmates' access to gratuities (along with inmate purchases and private property) is of central importance to the quality-of-life of inmates. In addition, a system of gratuities provides opportunities for small savings to be made for release, or to make a minor contribution to support family needs or to pay out outstanding fines. In these ways, the correctional centre can provide an opportunity to guide the acquisition of prudent habits and a better understanding of personal money management. However, inmates have notoriously poor money management skills, and in many cases spend all of their gratuities impulsively and in some cases seek to supplement their gratuities from outside the correctional centre from family members who may be in a marginal monetary position themselves. At worst, inmates may intimidate or steal from other inmates or supplement their money by organising or selling drugs or other contraband. Correctional centres should guard against any forms of monetary intimidation and provide encouragement to inmates to save part of their gratuities for the future or to assist their family and others, as well as provide information and advice on personal money management. 103 An equitable gratuity system should reward inmates for work completed according to level of skill and hours worked. 103.1 All gratuities should be credited to inmates' accounts on a weekly basis, and must be recorded and controlled in a transparent and effective manner. 103.2 The gratuities should generally be scaled according to whether inmates are required to contribute to the costs of their care and custody. 103.3 The awarding of different scales or levels of gratuities should be applied equitably, based upon skill and workload. Particular care must be taken to ensure that ethnic or cultural groups are not disproportionately represented in the lowest gratuity scales. 103.4 Inmates undertaking full-time education or training should be eligible for gratuities at a range of scales or levels, including the highest gratuity level. 103.5 All inmates should be able to easily access accurate and up-to date records of their finances. 103.6 The correctional centre may also provide that a part of the earnings may be retained by the administration so as to constitute a saving fund to be handed over to the inmate on his/her release. Inmates should be encouraged to save money. This should be accompanied with budgeting education. 103.7 A simple procedure should be in place to allow visitors to deposit money into inmates' telephone or private cash accounts. However, the correctional centre should seek to ensure the propriety of such deposits. Inmates who arrive without private money should be offered a loan/pay advance to use in the correctional centre shop or canteen.

This should include a range of healthy alternatives. 104.5 The list of available goods should be publicised prominently, preferably in every residential wing or accommodation area. Any price changes should be consistent with community price changes. 104.6 Price lists must be kept up-to date. 104.7 The needs of inmates should be regularly assessed and provided for in the correctional centre shop and ordering system. 104.8 Access to canteen purchases should include inmates at court, segregated and protected custody inmates, new arrivals to the correctional centre and those sick in cell or otherwise confined. 104.9 A wide range of suitable hobby materials should be available through the correctional centre shop or by order. 104.10 Inmates should be regularly consulted on the range of goods that is available for purchase.

Allowing inmates to retain some private property is a way of inmates maintaining a sense of themselves as distinct and unique human beings as well as enjoying the intrinsic value of the item. However, there needs to be sensible limits placed upon the amount and type of private property that each inmate can retain in order that the security, safety and good order of the correctional centre may be maintained. 105 Inmates should be able to keep a small number of approved items as private property. 105.1 There should be an effective and equitable process for identifying and regulating private property in cells. 105.2 Inmates should not be arbitrarily deprived of property without being informed of the cause, and having some right of appeal to a higher authority. 105.3 Inmate property which is to be retained at the correctional centre, either in an inmate's personal possession or in storage, should be recorded, stored, transferred and controlled in an effective manner and in a way that respects the entitlement of the inmate to such property. Property that is not to be retained at the correctional centre should be disposed of by the inmate, where appropriate. 105.4 Correctional centres should ensure the safekeeping and accurate recording of property that is assessed as having a significant monetary value and personal items such as photographs. Inmates' in-cell property should be able to be secured. 105.5 Inmates should be able to arrange access to property not held in their possession. 105.6 On the release of an inmate, all property and any accumulated unspent money should be returned to the inmate. 105.7 Processes must be in place to expeditiously and fairly resolve inmate claims of damaged or lost property.

Inmates should be informed through the case management process about the regimes and different levels of control that accompany each security stage. Except where to do so would unreasonably threaten the safety of the community, the last stage of every correctional centre sentence should be completed in minimum-security with increased levels of trust replacing the high level of institutional control found in closed-security correctional centres. There is a considerable body of evidence to show that the first three to six months are the most critical for re-offending. Good assistance with preparation for release can significantly reduce re-offending. In the last few months prior to release, every inmate should have access to basic welfare, such as assistance with accommodation, employment and social security benefits. 125 While all inmates should be held in custody at the least restrictive level consistent with protecting the safety of the community, those who are in the last few months of their sentence prior to release should be placed in minimum-security and preferably in pre-release centres or transitional facilities. 125.1 A range of fit-for-purpose pre-release and/or transitional facilities should be available in each region so that inmates' release may be made close to their home area. 125.2 Equitable provision for male and female inmates should be made with pre-release centres and/or transitional facilities. 125.3 The regimes at pre-release centres should be focused on inmates developing skills and knowledge, support structures and linkages appropriate to their safe return to the community.

This may mean checking that arrangements for friends or family to collect an inmate are viable or providing a ticket for public transport, ensuring that arrangements are in place where connections or overnight stays are involved. 127.2 Inmates whose only transport back to their home is an infrequent or weekly service should be given favourable consideration for a release synchronised with the service departure, even if this means releasing the inmate earlier than would otherwise be the case. 127.3 For foreign national inmates facing deportation or removal, this obligation is passed to the Commonwealth Government. Supporting Documentation EPR 33.3 R-SGCA 3.18Employment For most inmates, work provides a way out of the mindless tedium of idleness, a constructive use of their time, an opportunity to learn new skills, and a way of earning a small gratuity. For the correctional centre system, such work enables inmates to offset the cost of keeping them in custody by undertaking work that otherwise would need to be undertaken through contract or paid employment. For the community, it provides a mechanism through which inmates may make some reparation for the harm they have done. Consequently, it is important that correctional centres provide appropriate work opportunities for inmates. However, inmates have a right to safe and healthy working conditions that must comply with relevant legislation, such as the Work Health and Safety Act 2011. Inmate work should never be afflictive or degrading nor expose the inmate to ridicule. 128 Inmates should have access to a range of productive employment opportunities. 128.1 All sentenced inmates should be required to work or undertake education or training, subject to their physical and mental capacity. 128.2 The correctional centre should have sufficient employment opportunities to employ all inmates. 128.3 Inmate employment should be constructive and beneficial and not be afflictive. 128.4 Inmates should be informed of the full range of employment opportunities available. 128.5 Inmates should have equal opportunity to apply for all work. 128.6 The mix of inmates undertaking work outside the correctional centre or other desirable work in the correctional centre should reflect the inmate mix. That is, all groups should participate equitably in the most advantageous and better paid work. 128.7 Employment opportunities should be free of gender or racial stereo-typing. 128.8 Employment opportunities should reflect the needs of the population, wherever possible.

The challenge for each correctional centre management team is to ensure that they understand the correctional centre's role and the target population well enough to ensure that regimes are appropriately calibrated and directed to achieve the outcomes sought for that population. This also requires the agency head office to ensure that its capital planning results in congruence between the security classification of the facilities it constructs and that of the inmate population they will accommodate. Correctional centre Strategic and Business Plans, and reporting against these, should convey information about the nature and outcomes of the custodial experience for both staff and inmates. 141 Each correctional centre should be integrated into a wider corporate learning environment to ensure lessons learned from and recommendations of inquiries, investigations and reports are, where appropriate, integrated into correctional practice.

These may include male or female inmates (including some female inmates with babies), Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal inmates, remand and sentenced inmates, disabled and mentally impaired inmates, foreign national inmates, older and younger inmates, as well as protection inmates. 144.2 Based upon each correctional centre's inmate profile, the structured regime should address inmates' risks and needs. 144.3 Each correctional centre's regime should be regularly reviewed for its ability to meet the risks and needs of its inmate population, and to respond to trends that emerge in the inmate profile. 144.4 The correctional centre regime should not aggravate the suffering inherent in imprisonment. 144.5 Correctional centre regimes should approximate as closely as possible the positive aspects of life in the community. 144.6 As far as possible, individual correctional centres or separate sections of a correctional centre should be used to facilitate the management of different regimes for specific categories of inmates. 144.7 Correctional centre regimes should provide at least 10 hours a day outside cells for an adequate level of inmate human and social interaction and for program participation. 145 Each correctional centre should have a Financial Plan. 145.1 Each correctional centre should develop and document a budget, together with financial management delegations and processes, in order to deploy financial resources and equipment to support the Business Plan. Supporting Documentation SMR 60(1), 68, 72(1) EPR and community relations Australian communities are subjected to considerable misinformation and disinformation in relation to penal policy and practice. The media tends to focus on the sensational and the salacious which corrections sector, unfortunately, is periodically able to supply. There are sound reasons why the community needs to be closely engaged with its correctional centres and populations, especially since the majority of the latter will be someone's neighbour, someday. First, the inmate population is a fundamentally unwell one, with high demands for services which are beyond the ability of correctional centres, on their own, to meet in full. Consequently, community service providers (not-for-profit organisations, individuals and other representative groups and community-based service providers) should be encouraged to become directly involved in the delivery of services and to visit correctional centres. Second, the treatment of inmates should emphasize, not their exclusion from the community, but their continuing part in it. Community-based service providers should therefore be enlisted, wherever possible, to assist staff in the task of social rehabilitation of inmates and particularly in their preparation for release and subsequent reintegration. Third, correctional centres should actively cultivate a range of outreach services and connections, to provide opportunities for inmates to contribute to the well-being of the local community and the environment and make some reparation for the harm done by their offending. Fourth, community connection to and engagement with correctional centres will ensure greater understanding of and support for the work of correctional centre staff. This can assist in responding to inaccurate reporting and to allay community concerns. Finally, community confidence in penal practice will be encouraged through the transparency and openness of correctional centres to the communities in which they are located. 146 A wide range of community-based service providers should be regularly involved in the operations of correctional centres. 146.1 The encouragement and coordination of on-going engagement with appropriate community-based service providers is the responsibility of the correctional centre General Managers who should ensure that it is appropriately facilitated and managed. 146.2 Correctional centre General Managers should particularly encourage community- based service providers who can contribute to inmates' spiritual and cultural guidance, post-release connections for employment, housing and domestic, financial and life skills development. 146.3 There should be a dedicated contact point within the correctional centre where providers can book and be assured of the availability of the inmate/s wishing to access their service, an escort and a safe and suitable meeting place. This contact point should also be responsible for advising providers in the event there are changes to any aspect of the confirmed booking. 146.4 The correctional centre should continuously assess the changing sub-group needs among inmates and ensure that minorities receive as much community assistance and contact as is practicable and appropriate.RESOURCES AND SYSTEMS RESOURCES AND SYSTEMS Inspection standards for adult custodial services in New South Wales112 113 Inspection standards for adult custodial services in New South Wales146.5 The correctional centre should maintain up to date records on all community- based-service providers, including contact details and a description of their potential contribution to positive inmate development. 146.6 Identifying diverse reparation options should be an on-going objective, presenting inmates with the opportunity to contribute to the welfare of the local community. Evaluation of these activities, acknowledgement of participating inmates and feedback to the community should be on-going. Supporting Documentation EPR 90.2 147 Community-based service providers should undergo an appropriate induction process. 147.1 The correctional centre should conduct appropriate checks and clearances for such providers. 147.2 The correctional centre should regularly evaluate the material presented and the results of programs and assistance offered by community-based service providers, using the views of inmate participants in their reviews. 147.3 The correctional centre has a responsibility to ensure that no inmate or group of inmates is prevented from accessing a service because of family, cultural or religious tensions that exist between the inmate/s and the community-based service provider. Further, the correctional centre should ensure it is aware of any family, tribal, gender or cultural barriers that would affect inmates' access to community-based services. Supporting Documentation R-SGCA 5.14148 The community should be invited to know more about and have input into correctional centres, staff and their work, and in so doing, have a better understanding of the justice system. 148.1 A broadly representative Community Consultation Committee should be formed for each correctional centre. Such a committee should meet regularly with the correctional centre management and contribute to the correctional centre's operations and its public standing, thus enhancing the centre's transparency and accountability. 148.2 The correctional centre should establish a positive relationship with other representative or advocacy bodies and communities relevant to the correctional centre population, to achieve better outcomes for these inmates. 148.3 Aboriginal cultural issues should be addressed by correctional centre management engaging with members of Aboriginal communities and representative bodies. 148.4 Minutes should be kept of such meetings and Consultation Committee members should be provided with information concerning the progress of initiatives being undertaken.
