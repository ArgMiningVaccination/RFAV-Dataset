[\u00ab Go Back](javascript:history.go(-1);) Posted: 06/30/21 Summer Safety: Fireworks, Food, Swim, Heat, and COVID-19 Little Rock, Ark. - The Fourth of July is this weekend, and it is important to remember safety precautions for fireworks, food, swimming, and heat along with precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. COVID-19 Precautions The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) encourages all Arkansans ages 12 and up to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself and reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. These vaccines are safe and effective. Per Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) guidelines, those who are fully vaccinated can resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing, except in limited circumstances. For those who are not fully vaccinated, wearing a mask and physically distancing is recommended. To find a vaccine clinic near you, call 1-800-985-6030 or visit the ADH website. Firework Safety Fireworks-related injuries are common on the Fourth of July. Improper use of fireworks can lead to death and injury, including burns, cuts, and foreign objects in the eye. To prevent injury, keep these safety tips in mind: \u00b7 Read all labels and instructions before igniting. \u00b7 A responsible adult should supervise all firework activities. \u00b7 Use fireworks outdoors in a clear area, away from buildings and vehicles. \u00b7 Dispose of spent fireworks by wetting them down and placing them in a metal trash can away from any building or flammable materials. \u00b7 Never give fireworks to children. \u00b7 Never shoot fireworks of any kind near pets. \u00b7 Obey all local laws regarding the use of fireworks. Food Safety The chances of a foodborne illness increase in summer due to various factors, including warmer temperatures. When handling food during the holiday, stay healthy and safe by using these tips: \u00b7 Use an insulated cooler filled with ice or frozen gel packs when bringing food to a picnic or cookout. \u00b7 Instead of using one cooler for all events, use a smaller or larger one based on the items it will hold. A full cooler will maintain its cold temperature longer than a partially filled one. \u00b7 Avoid opening a cooler repeatedly so that your food stays colder longer. \u00b7 In hot weather (above 90 \u00b0F), food should never sit out for more than one hour. \u00b7 Serve cold food in small portions and keep the rest in the cooler. \u00b7 After cooking meat and poultry on the grill, keep it hot until served - at 140\u00b0F or warmer. \u00b7 Keep hot food hot by setting it to the side of the grill rack, not directly over the coals where they could overcook. \u00b7 Use different utensils for handling raw meat than you use for cooked or ready-to-eat foods. Swim Safety About 10 people die from unintentional drowning every day in the United States. One of every five deaths are children aged 14 or younger. Keep these tips in mind, so you and your loved ones can swim safely: \u00b7 Enroll children in formal swimming lessons to reduce the risk of drowning among children aged 1 to 4 years old. \u00b7 Designate a responsible adult to watch young children while swimming or playing in or around the water. \u00b7 Because drowning occurs quickly and quietly, adults should not be involved in any other distracting activity (such as reading, playing cards, or talking on the phone) while supervising children, even if lifeguards are present. \u00b7 Do not replace life jackets with air-filled or foam toys, such as \"water wings,\" \"noodles,\" or inner-tubes. These toys are not life jackets and are not designed to keep swimmers safe. \u00b7 Avoid drinking alcohol before or during swimming, boating, or water skiing. \u00b7 Always swim with a buddy. Use swimming sites that have lifeguards when possible. Heat-related Illness Prevention Heat-related illness is caused by your body's inability to cool down properly. The body normally cools itself by sweating. However, under certain conditions sweating is not enough. People who have higher risks for heat-related illness or death include children under the age of four, seniors age 65 or older, anyone overweight, and those who are ill or on certain medications. Heat-related illnesses are preventable. Simple tips to prevent them are: \u00b7 Stay in an air-conditioned area during the hottest hours of the day. If your home does not have air conditioning, consider public places like a library, senior center, or mall. \u00b7 Wear light, loose-fitted clothing. \u00b7 Drink water often. Don't wait until you are thirsty. \u00b7 Avoid unnecessary hard work or activities if you are outside or without air conditioning. \u00b7 Avoid unnecessary sun exposure. Wear a hat when you are in the sun. \u00b7 Use sunscreen as directed and reapply regularly, especially when swimming. For more information regarding injury prevention, "}
