Improve Circulation Reduce Toxins Improve Aches & Pains Healing is more likely and more lasting when we decrease the burden of toxins our bodies have to bear. Feeling stuck in your recovery? Looking to improve your energy and focus? Proper detoxification might be the missing piece keeping you from more health and vitality. Environmental toxins are increasingly abundant in our world today. Plastics, pesticides, herbicides, and heavy metals are often lurking in everything from water to cookware to baby products. They've become so pervasive that nobody is immune to exposure. These toxins can damage DNA and lead to neurological problems, hormone disruption, metabolic disturbance, nutrient depletion, gut dysbiosis, and a host of other issues. At Holistic Healing Arts, detoxification has been a core part of our healing protocols since our beginning. We're experts at helping you improve your body's own detoxification pathways, safely and effectively. \"I can't say enough wonderful things about my experience with detox therapies at HHA\" - K.C., Orlando, FL But don't our bodies eliminate these toxins naturally? In a perfect world, yes. Our bodies have specific organs and systems that assist with detoxification. But most people experiencing chronic illness have impaired detoxification. Anything that impairs the cell's biochemical ability to detoxify will prevent your body from fully eliminating toxins. These factors are many, and include: Genetic mutations Nutritional deficiencies Oxidative stress Chronic inflammation Total body burden of toxins With so many factors negatively affecting our detoxification, it's hard to imagine someone who wouldn't benefit from detox therapies. To understand how our detoxification therapies work, it helps to understand your lymphatic system. The Lymphatic System Many of our detox therapies work on the lymphatic system of your body. Your lymphatic system is a vast network of 600 lymph nodes and vessels that penetrate nearly every tissue in your body. It has 3 main functions: Removing foreign and damaged cells - like bacteria and cancer cells Transporting fats from the digestive system Removing excess fluid from body tissues The fluid that flows through these nodes and vessels is called lymph fluid - a milky substance made of lymphocytes, proteins, fats, and water. If you're thinking this sounds similar to blood, you're right. But a key difference is that while your heart pumps blood throughout your body, your lymph fluid has no such pump. Instead, it relies on movement to get where it needs to go. Lymphatic Congestion Your body has 2-10 times more lymphatic fluid than blood. Because of the vast amount of lymph fluid moving through your body, without a pump to help, lymphatic congestion can be a common problem. The components in your lymph fluid are electrically charged to repel one another. These opposing charges keep it in a fluid state. But when the movement of lymph fluid slows down, the electrical charge is lost. This causes the components to bond together, creating a much stickier substance that doesn't flow freely like it should. And when your lymphatic fluid isn't flowing freely, the toxins aren't moved into your organs of elimination - your liver, kidneys, colon, and skin - in a timely manner. So anything you can do to stimulate the flow of lymph fluid will have a beneficial effect on your detoxification - and your health. Detox Therapies We Offer We use a variety of therapies to help your body eliminate toxins gently and safely. Lymphstar ProFusion ENHANCE DETOXIFICATION BY IMPROVING CIRCULATION $125 (60 min) / $200 (90 min) / $250 (120 min) The Lymphstar ProFusion is a multifunction device that combines physical vibration, sound waves, and light energy to break up areas of lymphatic congestion.

Your Lymphstar session may also include: Castor oil packs Essential oil skin brushing Detoxifying clay treatment The results are cumulative, and a series of sessions is the most effective way to achieve the best results. - Longevity\u00ae Ozone Sauna RELEASE WATER-SOLUBLE TOXINS AND REDUCE MICROBIAL LOAD $90 (15-30 min) The Ozone Sauna improves circulation while penetrating lymph and fat. The sauna also reduces bacteria, yeast, and other harmful pathogens on the surface of the skin. The Ozone Sauna is a hot steam pod. Once you're seated inside, ozone enters your body through the pores in your skin. By increasing body temperature, the sauna allows your skin to purge water-soluble toxins by sweating. Ozone and infrared saunas work together to create an optimal detoxification effect. - Infrared Sauna RELEASE FAT-SOLUBLE TOXINS AND IMPROVE WEIGHT LOSS $90 (15-30 min) Infrared saunas use deeper heat to stimulate fat-soluble toxins to move out of your cells. Because infrared saunas are able to produce sweat at a lower temperature, many sensitive people tolerate them better than other types of saunas. And since infrared light penetrates deeper into tissue \u2014 up to 3 inches \u2014 it actually mobilizes and burns fat. This not only helps with weight loss, but with detoxification too, since many of the toxins we absorb are surrounded and trapped by fat. Ozone and infrared saunas work together to create an optimal detoxification effect. - iNLight Therapy REDUCE PAIN, IMPROVE CIRCULATION, AND INCREASE ENERGY $65 (20 min) OR $25 as an add-on to another detox treatment iNLight Therapy is a gentle, silent, low-level laser therapy.

Detox Full Circuit 150 minutes $275 Experience three distinct therapies in one relaxing and rejuvenating session. These three therapies work synergistically to improve your body's detoxification pathways, and are designed to support your physician's goals for you.

LymphStar Pro\u00ae Treatment - 60 minutes IonCleanse\u00ae Ionic Foot Bath - 30 minutes Ozone Steam Sauna - 30 minutes Dry Skin Brushing Improve lymphatic circulation and invigorate your nervous system. Dry skin brushing is based on the ancient Chinese concepts of acupuncture and acupressure. By applying friction to the acupuncture points, dry skin brushing stimulates nerve points spread over the surface of the skin. The entire nervous system is stimulated and invigorated, and every organ, gland, muscle, and ligament benefits. Dry skin brushing, if done correctly, also helps physically move lymphatic fluid through the body and speeds up the flow of lymph. Looking to start dry brushing at home?
