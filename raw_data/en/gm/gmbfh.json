A needle-free healing ritual that therapeutically anoints the body with carefully selected essential oils Drawing upon the wisdom traditions of Ayurveda, Aromatherapy and Classical Acupuncture - along with modern interpretations of healing through sound and the craniosacral system - I have developed Aromatic Acupuncture through years of refining both my own awareness and sensitivity to others. This healing ritual uses only the purest and most potent essential oils to attune the entire system. The complex notes of the oils, along with the tonal resonance of tuning forks, aid our bodies in re-establishing balance which results in full-spectrum wellness, integration and deeper states of consciousness. KIND WORDS What to Expect How it Works A session involves anointing the body with specific essential oils at specific points. These points have been utilized in healing practices for centuries as they embody particular energetic frequencies and healing potential. Once applied, the essential oils express their unique therapeutic signature. To deepen the treatment, tuning forks are placed on various points - usually determined during the session through inner listening and intuitive dialogue with the receiver. This use of vibratory toning serves to enhance the healing experience as the resonance of the tuning forks allows the oils' messages to travel into deeper layers. As the body receives this phyto-intelligence at the level of peptides and neurotransmitters, subtle yet profound healing shifts occur. A subtle treatment that echoes the way we're evolving as a species The human body is brilliantly designed to maintain balance within its multiple systems, all the way down to the cells. It is a masterpiece of complexity that knows what to do and how to self-correct without us getting in the way. Aromatic Acupuncture is a method of communicating with the intelligence inherently embedded within us. It serves as a natural reminder, not a cure. We cannot see electrical impulses in the nervous system as they light up and send messages at warp speed. Nor can we see plants communicating with each other and the environment. But we know these transmissions take place. We see the results and have faith in the process. Aromatic Acupuncture lives in this realm - of faith, intelligent communication and reverence for nature and her healing gnosis. It has emerged through experimentation, exploration and intuition, along with studious research and practice. Just like a sentient being, it is not static; it continues to morph and evolve. It is work that is alive just as plants are alive, musical vibrations are alive and our breath, prana and consciousness are alive, all with animated rhythm and flow.
