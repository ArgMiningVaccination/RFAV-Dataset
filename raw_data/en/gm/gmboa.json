This law became effective October 1, 2019. When a health care practitioner has action taken against their license for unprofessional conduct involving sexual misconduct, they are required to notify any patient scheduled for an appointment with that license holder. This is required during the time the health care practitioner is under the formal disciplinary Order or Stipulation to Informal Disposition (STID). The patient notification must include a copy of the Order or STID, a description of the sanctions, how long the license holder will be under the Order or STID, and information on how the patient can get more information. - "}
