The care is based in science that treats the source of many common health conditions in a safe non-invasive, non-toxic manner. Dr. Milbauer, D.C. sees her role as providing postural, structural, corrective care\u2014providing an opportunity for her patient's bodies to regain health naturally. The primary goal of care at Cynergy Chiropractic is to reduce or eliminate the damaging effects of abnormal posture on the body. By improving a patient's posture and spinal bio mechanics (spinal position) using CBP\u00ae,the stress and strain upon the nervous system is minimized, and the overall stress and strain on the joints of the spine is reduced. This improved posture allows the body to function more normally, and in many cases prevents the abnormal wear and tear of disc degeneration and spinal arthritis. Where traditional forms of Chiropractic care may be limiting, our unique approach, utilizing Chiropractic Biophysics may provide permanent relief from conditions and symptoms including: - Bulging Discs - Headaches/Migraines - Earaches/Dizziness/Ringing - Weakness or Fatigue - Arthritis - Whiplash injuries - Sciatica - Numbness or Tingling - "}
