She whispered to him, told him to stay steady. Tuff was already calm, though, and seemed to know what was coming. The nearly 1,000-pound animal stood tall and still as Barr stuck the first thin, tiny needle into him not far from his tail. Then she worked her way up his back, found a second spot. Then another [on a hip, on a flank, on a knee, in a coronet](https://www.habitatforhorses.org/kidscorral/vocabulary_I.html).

The whole thing took just a couple of minutes. Tuff's reward afterward? A mint TicTac and a sense of peace. \"The veterinarian said to just put him down,\" said Barr, choking up as she spoke about the 2-year-old horse she rescued in October and now owns. \"This horse didn't need to be put down. He needed to be healed.\" Born with weak joints, Tuff stumbled around on spindly legs and could never have been ridden. Barr has been treating him for a year, and, with solid footing under him now, he lives a life of luxury as he grows stronger in one of the barn stalls Barr rents in rural Johnstown in Licking County.

One is their nonprofit organization, [True North Veteran Support](https://www.facebook.com/TrueNorthVeteranSupport2011/), that aims through its work with equine therapy to ease military veterans' and first responders' post-traumatic stress. The other is focusing on Barr Equine Therapies, the business through which the couple \u2014 who live near Sunbury in Delaware County \u2014 helps animals through alternative, natural therapies such as [Reiki ](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/reiki/introduction.htm)and acupuncture. Michelle Martin, who boards her horses in the same barn as Barr, said she has seen firsthand Barr's touch heal wounds, remove inflammation and take away pain. After her registered Paint horse, Bandit, raked himself across a galvanized-steel gate and dragged it, his legs were a mess. But after acupuncture, they weren't even swollen a day later. \"I already believed,\" Martin said, \"but you can't see that and not know how much this helps these horses.\" Barr and her husband \u2014 who both studied nearly full time for a year through the International College of Equine and Canine Therapies \u2014 have also treated goats, pigs and dogs. Ruth Robinson said that Barr's treatments gave her family's late greyhound/Lab mix, Charlie, close to three years more than the veterinarian thought the old dog had left. His arthritis was bad; his legs were weak and wobbly. A friend who had horses suggested letting Barr try to help. During the first visit about three years ago, Charlie stood on the couch with his head buried in Robinson's side as Barr slipped the tiny needles into the dog's skin. When the treatment ended, Charlie collapsed and lay on the couch. \"I was very frightened. I thought, 'Oh, what have we done?'\" Robinson said from her Westerville home. \"Then I looked into Charlie's eyes, and they were sparkling and bright. He was so happy and so relaxed. We were hooked. We are so grateful for Susan.\" It is the horses, though, that really hold Barr's heart. \"I am happiest in a barn,\" Barr said. \"Horses carry all their emotion around with them. When I'm near them, I feel what the horses feel.\" In Ohio, someone can legally perform acupuncture on animals only with the permission of the treating veterinarian. Although he couldn't speak to the practice of non-veterinarian acupuncture, Florida veterinarian Dr. Huisheng Xie said some 5,000 veterinarians in the United States use traditional Chinese veterinary medicine, including acupuncture. Xie is a clinical professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Florida, which will open a new [Equine Acupuncture Center ](https://largeanimal.vethospitals.ufl.edu/hospital-services/equine-integrative-medicine/acupuncture-rehabilitation/)at its hospital on Tuesday. Xie said the practice of acupuncture on animals has grown swiftly in the past decade. \"Acupuncture is not a believing system,\" Xie wrote in an email. \"A great tremendous amount of research papers indicate that acupuncture stimulation leads to physiological responses that treat many diseases. The results are based on the physiological and clinical effects. It is considered a success ... if lame horses become sound, paralyzed dogs walk and then run, or epilepsy dogs are seizure-free, etc.\" For her part, as she relaxed on a stool and Tuff whinnied in the stall behind her Wednesday, Barr said that so many of the horses she rescues and heals go on to help veterans work through their emotional traumas in therapy sessions. \"To be able to help an animal is a gift,\" she said. \"It's so fulfilling when you take an animal that everyone said to put down, and you save it, and then you see it become a soulmate to a veteran.
