Diversity and Inclusion UNIVERSITY POLICIES NON-DISCRIMINATION STATEMENT CONTACT US DIVERSITY UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES DIVISION UCHICAGO BIOSCIENCES APPLY NOWCurrent Students When I was searching for graduate schools I had a general idea of the kind of research that I wanted to do, but I was unsure about the topic I wanted to work on. One of the main reasons I chose the University of Chicago Medical Physics program was that first years are able to rotate through at least two labs before committing to a thesis lab. By rotating through through a couple of labs, I found the one that best fit my interests. Living in Chicago, there is never a shortage of things to do. When I have free time, it's never hard to find something entertaining going on in the city. Looking back, I have no doubt that I made the right decision to come to Chicago. Not only will I be able to perform cutting edge research, I will be fully prepared for life after graduate school. Corey Smith, Medical PhysicsDuring the application and decision process, I asked myself the question, \"Where will I have the most fun while doing great research?\" Everyone affiliated with the Division of Biological Sciences is committed to developing critical thinkers and independent researchers, but the strength of this program is much more than that. I am continually impressed with the individual attention that I received at the University of Chicago while taking classes and quality of mentoring within labs; the faculty here strikes an impressive balance being world class researchers as well as invested mentors for graduate students. Additionally, the graduate students are hard working and passionate about science, and we also have fun inside and out of lab through participation in IM Sports, trips to Downtown Chicago, movie nights, and lots of other activities. The University of Chicago was the answer to my question when I was deciding where to attend graduate school and still is today. Lauren Blake, Human Genetics Having grown up in the area, I knew I was interested in moving back to Chicago to pursue my graduate studies, but it was not until I came and spoke to the professors and other students that I was sold on UChicago. I knew that I wanted to work on disorders of the nervous system and was impressed by the number of opportunities available for translational research on campus. Thanks to a supportive mentor and the numerous student enrichment programs, I have gained experience on a diverse range of projects preparing me well for a future career in science. Furthermore, being located in Chicago has allowed me to explore such a diverse range of activities when outside of the lab, between great food, dancing, and cultural activities (not to mention an amazing lakefront!)

NON-DISCRIMINATION STATEMENT CONTACT US DIVERSITY UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES DIVISION UCHICAGO BIOSCIENCES APPLY NOWBiomedical Sciences Cluster The Biomedical Sciences Cluster at the University of Chicago consists of four graduate programs: Cancer Biology, Immunology, Microbiology, and Molecular Metabolism and Nutrition. The thematic curricular focus of the Biomedical Sciences Cluster is the basic scientific study of human biology and related disease processes. Each program in Biomedical Sciences is a distinct, degree-granting unit in the Biological Sciences Division. The cluster system enables these programs to integrate faculty, coursework, research programs, training programs, and seminars/ symposia for a truly multidisciplinary training experience. The result for graduate students is an integrated and flexible course of study, with options to work with over 170 full time faculty. For both pre and postdoctoral trainees and faculty, the interdisciplinary nature of the Biomedical Sciences Cluster provides extensive opportunities for interaction and collaboration. Prospective students should apply to one of the four graduate programs within the Biomedical Sciences. It is in the best interest of applicants to apply to programs in rank order based on interest (highest to lowest). Applicants need not identify four individual programs, however the option is available if a student is undecided on his or her area of specialization. It is perfectly acceptable to apply to only one program. Students are admitted to the Cluster into one of the four programs, but have the option of changing programs during the first year. Students combine study in core basic science areas with specialized study in programmatic core areas within their area of particular research interest. All students in the Biomedical Sciences Cluster must attend the All Stars seminar series which takes place during their first year throughout the Autumn and Winter quarters. This seminar series provides an opportunity for new students to learn about the research taking place in Cluster faculty laboratories. The goals of the Cluster curriculum are to ensure that students are adequately grounded in the basic sciences, exposed to the latest research and methodologies in their particular area of research interest, and allowed maximum flexibility in pursuit of their particular research interests.

Examining the development and function of nervous systems not only holds the key to better understanding the interaction of animals and human beings with their environments, but will also allow the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of neurological, behavioral, and psychiatric disorders. At the University of Chicago, there are three closely interacting, interdepartmental graduate programs in Neuroscience that study nervous systems, brain function, and behavior: Computational Neuroscience, Neurobiology, and Integrative Neuroscience. Combined, these three programs form the Neuroscience Cluster, which comprises over 80 faculty members from both basic research and clinical departments. Computational Neuroscience focuses on mathematical modeling of neural systems and sophisticated analytic approaches to neural data. The Neurobiology program studies the nervous system, including the genetic and molecular basis of neural development, the activity of channels and transporters, synaptic transmission and neuronal signaling, properties of sensory systems, neuronal activity which generates behavior, and the theoretical basis of information processing. Integrative Neuroscience , a track of study in the Department of Psychology (Social Sciences Division), focuses on neural systems that mediate complex behaviors. Admissions Links Application Information Financial Support Frequently Asked Questions NON-DISCRIMINATION STATEMENT CONTACT US DIVERSITY UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES DIVISION UCHICAGO BIOSCIENCES APPLY NOWComputational Neuroscience The University of Chicago has a long tradition of innovative research in the neurosciences. K. C. Cole developed the voltage clamp here, Stephen Polyak and C. J. Herrick did pioneering work on the anatomy of the retina and brain, and Jack Cowan and Hugh Wilson were among the first to develop mathematical analyses of the dynamics of cortical neurons using non-linear dynamics. This tradition is continued in the Committee on Computational Neuroscience, which provides an interdepartmental and interdivisional focus for multidisciplinary training in neuroscience. Computational neuroscience is a relatively new area of inquiry that is concerned with how components of animal and human nervous systems interact to produce behaviors. It relies on quantitative and modeling methods to understand the function of the nervous system, natural behaviors and cognitive processes, and to design human-made devices that duplicate behaviors. Students in Computational Neuroscience take the required courses in the Computational Neuroscience curriculum, complete two laboratory rotations, take a qualifying exam at the end of their second year, and enroll for at least nine quarters of research. The required courses are typically taken in the first year and grouped into two themes. The neuroscience theme presents the basic concepts and phenomena in neuroscience. The computational neuroscience theme presents quantitative and theoretical techniques required for a modern analysis of the nervous system, cognition, and behavior. The curriculum and course work in computational neuroscience prepare students for research in neurobiology, psychology, or in the mathematical or engineering sciences. Graduates from this program move to traditional academic careers, careers in data science, biomedical research or engineering, or opportunities in the corporate world.

Novel molecular, cellular, systems- level, and computational techniques are used to explore the functions of the brain to an extent that was unforeseen only a short time ago. The Graduate Program in Neurobiology, with more than sixty faculty members using state-of-the-art techniques is a large, interdisciplinary program where all students receive concentrated attention from faculty who serve as mentors, advisory committee members, and course instructors. Research strengths include molecular neurobiology, cellular neurophysiology, developmental neurobiology, systems neuroscience and computational neurobiology. Each student takes a core curriculum of three courses, and three electives. The student's faculty advisory committee is responsible for ensuring that students have taken courses appropriate for their research interests and may suggest additional course work in other fields such as cell physiology, molecular genetics, or mathematics. Neurobiology students rotate through two or three laboratories before choosing one for their thesis work near the end of the first year. About a year later, they qualify for PhD candidacy by presenting and defending a thesis proposal. Most of the remaining time is devoted to thesis research, although students also take electives and can take training in teaching or other professional skills. The average time to PhD is 6.0 years. Since its inception in 1979, the Program in Neurobiology has awarded over 140 PhD degrees.

The activities of medical physicists cover a broad spectrum from the study of basic biomedical processes to the diagnosis and treatment of disease. A medical physicist must be competent in physical and mathematical concepts related to imaging and radiation physics and must understand biological principles. Medical physicists engage in three broad areas of activity: clinical, research, and teaching. Clinical activities include consultation with radiation oncologists in the planning and delivery of radiation treatments for cancer, consultation with radiologists concerning the optimal use of medical imaging systems for the diagnosis of disease, and responsibility for radiation hazards. Research activities include the investigation of software, instrumentation, and quality control procedures in medical imaging and radiation therapy. The Committee on Medical Physics at The University of Chicago is recognized for its research excellence. Faculty with a primary interest in diagnostic imaging hold appointments in the Department of Radiology, whereas faculty with a primary interest in the physics of radiation therapy hold appointments in the Department of Radiation & Cellular Oncology. Many faculty also hold appointments in The University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center. Strong interactions exist among clinical and research staff in this highly collaborative field.

The program is organized around a common quantitative core curriculum designed to prepare students methodologically for more in-depth study in their chosen field and for dissertation research. Beyond the core curriculum, each student chooses a major disciplinary area of concentration, takes a sequence of advanced courses in that area, and prepares a dissertation of independent, original, and rigorous research in that area. Opportunities for such concentrated study are available in the three broad areas represented by the Public Health Sciences faculty: biostatistics, epidemiology , and health services research. In addition to the concentration, each student chooses a minor program of study in another area either represented by Department faculty or offered elsewhere at the University . The combination of the major concentration and minor program is intended to provide a curriculum with both disciplinary depth and an interdisciplinary perspective on problems in population health and biomedical science. The Public Health Sciences PhD program is also designed to accommodate students seeking a joint MD/PhD degree at the University of Chicago. Program requirements are modified to dovetail with coursework and clinical activities taken as part of the MD program. Specifically , core course requirements remain the same as those for non-MD students. However , major concentration course requirements are reduced, as there is expected synergy with medical school courses. Additionally, the minor program is waived, essentially being replaced by the student' s preparation in clinical medicine.

To preserve an environment of spirited and open debate, we should all have the opportunity to contribute to intellectual exchanges and participate fully in the life of the University. The ideas of different members of the University community will frequently conflict, and we do not attempt to shield people from ideas that they may find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even offensive. Nor , as a general rule, does the University intervene to enforce social standards of civility. There are, however, some circumstances in which behavior so violates our community's standards that formal University intervention may be appropriate. Acts of violence, explicit threats of violence directed at a particular individual that compromise that individual' s safety or ability to function within the University setting, or other criminal acts are direct affronts to the University' s values and warrant intervention by University officials. Abusive conduct directed at a particular individual that compromises that individual's ability to function within the University setting and/or that persists after the individual has asked that it stop may also warrant such intervention. Even if formal intervention is not appropriate in a particular situation, abusive or offensive behavior can nonetheless be inconsistent with the aspirations of the University community, and various forms of informal assistance and counseling are available.
