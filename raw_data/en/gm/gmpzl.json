However, please note that even if you meet these criteria, and you take and pass the HiSET exam, you will not be able to receive your state -issued high school equivalency diploma until y ou reach age 18 and your class from 9th grade has graduated. Residency: You do not have to be a resident of Iowa to take the HiSET exam. Test Preparation or Instruction: Iowa requires all test takers to receive instruction in an adult education classroom b efore taking the HiSET exam. The amount of instruction varies by testing center. You can find an adult education program by visiting Iowa's adult education programs .

Job Corps? Work? Military? Community Service? Before deciding about your future, it is important to ask yourself: What's right for me? Where do I see myself after high school? Am I motivated to continue on to college? How will I sup port myself ? What skills/talents do I have ? What additional education or training do I need to get the job I want? From High School to the Workforce College -Many jobs require a college degree. It's important to remember that college doesn't have to b e a 4 -year time commitment. Many degrees and diplomas can be completed in a matter of months or a couple of years. Vocational Training - Typical vocational programs are short, lasting from 5 to 12 months. The main appeal of these programs is their conce ntrated curriculum, job -training focus, and short course length. Vocational training schools offer a wide variety of training options in areas such as cosmetology, mechanical repair, court reporting, paralegal services, travel services, secretarial, and m edical assistance. Job Corps - a free education and training program that helps young people learn a career, and find and keep a good job. Job Corps provides the all -around skills needed to succeed in a career and in life if you are at least 16 years of a ge and qualify as low income. www.jobcorps.gov or 1-800-733-5627 36 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Work - If college isn't an option or you need extra time to earn money for tuition, going directly into the work force can offer many benefits, suc h as health insurance and tuition reimbursement programs. Iowa Workforce Development Center www.iowaworkforce.gov Choices Planner Tool http://www.icansucceed.o rg/ Military - Joining the military can offer discipline, earning money, saving for college, and learning a trade. Veterans are also entitled to many benefits both while in the service and after. It is critical that you carefully explore all the pros and cons of a military career since you can't easily drop out. Armed Services Web Sites United States Army www.goarmy.com or www.army.mil United States Army Reserve https://www.goarmy.com/reserve.html Army National Guard www.nationalguard.com United States Air F orce https://www.airforce.com/ United States Navy www.navy.mil United States Marines www.marines.com or www.usmc.mil United States Marine Forces Reserves www.marines.mil Community Service - Community service organizations offer a wide variety of choices that you can match with your skills and interests. Americorps, for example, offers hundreds of programs across the United States with a small stipend, plus a chance to obtain money for college or vocational training. http://www.americorps.gov/ You should expec t difficulties but know that the rewards of community service often outweigh the hardships \u2014 and can actually change the direction of a person's life.

You can take these tests in senior year as well to get a better sore. Make a timeline for your college and scholarship applications. Research deadlines now so you won't be rushed when applications are due. 39 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) 12th Grade Revie w coursework with your school counselor to be sure you have taken (or are scheduled to take) all the courses you need for your preferred colleges.

Compare acceptance letters and financial aid awards. Upon admittan ce, each college or university listed on your FAFSA will send you an award letter that shows the aid you are eligible to receive. Take AP exams for any AP subjects you studied in high school. Some colleges might award college credit based on your exam scor e. Decision time! Choose your college and notify them by mailing your commitment deposit check. Watch for College Decision Day celebrations at your high school. Summer After High School Make a budget. Review your Award Letter and pay close attention to the Cost of Attendance, which includes tuition, school fees and room and board. Depending on the school, your award letter might or might not include books, supplies, travel and personal expenses. If these costs aren't included, be sure to account for them an d other living expenses. Talk with your aftercare worker to see if any assistance is available. Make a payment timeline. When is your admissions deposit (your official decision of where you'll attend school) due? Your first tuition payment? Housing deposi t? If you need to, make a calendar to keep track. Register and attend orientation. Orientation allows you to meet your classmates and learn about support services on campus. Complete housing forms. If you plan to live on campus, make sure you know the de adline for filling out all the required housing forms and applications. Register for classes.

If you do not have a vehicle, look into public trans portation options and schedules. 40 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) 41 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) COLLEGE BOUND The importance of some type of education beyond high school has become widely evident in recent years. Options include four -year colleges and universities, community colleges, trade schools or apprenti ceships, and the military. Studies show that as educational attainment increases, income increases and the percent of population living in poverty decreases. People with postsecondary education live longer and are more likely to have health insurance cover age, vote and volunteer in their communities. A guide for foster youth college planning can be found at www.iowacollegeaid.gov/Foster . If you plan to go to college, you will need to take a placement t est. Which placement test you take depends on what type of college you plan to attend. 1.

State/private universities/colleges (bachelor 's degree programs) : ACT/SAT Most colleges in Iowa or the Midwest require the ACT. Unless you plan to attend college on the East/West Coast, you probably do not need to take the SAT. A. What is the ACT? The ACT is a national college admissions examination that consists of subject area tests in English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science. The ACT Plus Writing includes the four subject areas plus a 30 -minute Writing Test . ACT results are accepted by all four -year colleges and universities in the U.S. The ACT includes 215 multiple -choice questions and takes approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes to complete, including a short break (or just over four hours if you are taking the ACT Plus Writing). Actual testing time is 2 hours and 55 minutes (plus 30 minutes if you are taking the ACT Plus Writing). 42 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) The ACT is administered on six test dates in the U.S. The basic registration fee includes score reports for up to four college choices, if you list valid codes when you register.

There might be other funds available to pay your ACT fee. 3. Choosing a college or university What things are important to you whe n choosing a college? Obviously, you need to make sure a college offers the program of study that you want. But what about these other factors? Degrees offered Majors/minors Location (rural or urban)/distance from home Size of student population (from s mall at 1,000 to large at 35,000+) Public vs. private Costs (tuition, room and board, etc.) Financial assistance packages Campus resources (labs, libraries, computer access, etc.) Graduation rate/time Placement success/internship and co -op programs Class size Quality/reputation/ranking Safety (campus, community) Student body (diversity, gender, etc.) Social life (Greek organizations, sports, school spirit, etc.) Religious affiliation/independent Housing options (dorms, apartments, living at hom e) 43 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) When you plan a campus visit, try to include time to sit in on classes, eat a meal in the dining hall and hang around in the student center. You'll get a chance to imagine yourself as part of the campus. Talk to current students and ask, \"What are your favorite things about this campus?\" Colleges and Universities: Two-year community colleges provide the opportunity to get your feet wet before jumping into the four -year college arena. Community colleges generally offer programs of study that take anywh ere from a few months to two years to complete. Some courses are designed to transfer to four -year colleges if you decide to pursue additional higher education. Also, like vocational schools, community colleges often offer specialized job training in certa in areas. These studies are designed to prepare you for the workforce as soon as you complete training. Public colleges and universities are subsidized by the states where they are located and are generally less expensive than private colleges. However, t he cheapest rates go to residents of the state where the college is located. Out -of-state students usually pay much higher fees. Iowa has three Regent universities: University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls emphasizes preparation for careers in education; Iowa State University in Ames concentrates on science and technology; and University of Iowa in Iowa City is a major national research university, which is also known for operating the nation's largest university -owned teaching hospital. Private colleges are funded through endowments, tuition and donations. They usually cost a lot more, but don't rule them out! Private colleges can often offer enough financial aid to make them feasible for your budget. These colleges offer bachelor's degrees and a wide va riety of studies to choose from, usually in a smaller classroom setting. Many also offer graduate studies (studies after a bachelor's degree is completed), as do public universities, with opportunities to earn a master's, doctoral or professional degree (s uch as a medical or law degree). The curriculum is much broader than a two -year school and is designed to accommodate a variety of interests (unless you are going to a college that specializes in a certain area of study, such as music). 4. Paying for college College costs a lot of money. But if you apply for financial aid early and seek out grants and scholarships, you might be surprised by the results. Grants: Money that is \"granted\" to you that you do not have to repay. If you aged out of a court -ordered out-of-home placement in Iowa, you might be eligible for the Education & Training Voucher (ETV) and/or the All Iowa Opportunity Scholarship . See next page for more information. 44 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Institutional programs: Grants from institutional sources are the second most common type of student aid. Nearly 20 percent of available aid comes from colleges and universities. Scholarships: Scholarships are also money that does not have to be repaid. Often, scholarships are based on your academic or athletic performance and will require you to earn or maintain a certain grade point average (GPA). Being involved in school activities and community service can also help qualify for sholarships. Federal Work -Study (FWS): These programs provide part -time jobs on campus or in the comm unity. Youth aging out of foster care are eligible for work -study. You must indicate your interest in work -study on the FAFSA. Student loans: Unlike grants, scholarships and work -study, student loans are money that you borrow and must repay , with interest , once you leave college. Do not accept student loans unless you absolutely need them. Exhaust all grant, scholarship and work opportunities before deciding you need student loans. Loans are legal obligations, so before you sign your name on a loan documen t, think about the amount you'll have to repay over the years. TRIO programs (such as Upward Bound) are designed to help low -income students enter and complete college. TRIO provides assistance in choosing a college, tutoring, personal and financial couns eling, career counseling and workplace visits. Two -thirds of the students served must come from families in which neither parent is a college graduate . Steps to Get to College APPLY: Apply to more than one college. Apply to a safety school and at lea st one target school, as well as a dream school. FILE: File your FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). This form is necessary for federal and state aid, work -study, federal loans and many forms of institutional aid. DECIDE: Choose your co llege and inform the college of your plans to enroll. This usually must be done by May 1. TRANSITION: Watch for paperwork and deadlines that fall between your high school graduation and the start of college, such as tuition payments, housing application s and payments, orientation and registration. 45 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Steps to Get Financial Aid Step 1: File the FAFSA in October of your senior year in high school. You'll need to file again for every year that you plan to be in college. Go to fafsa.ed.gov and click the 'Start Here' button If you will turn age 18 in court -ordered foster care , remember to check \"yes\" when the application asks whether you are a \"ward of the court .\" This information is important as it alerts financial aid officials to look at only your income and assets when determining your award amount. If the financial aid processor requests additional information to process your application, submit it promptly. Step 2: Complete the State of Iowa Financial Aid Appli cation in October of your senior year in high school. You'll need to file again for every year that you plan to be in college. Go to IowaCollegeAid.gov/IFAA This is the application for the ETV-Educatio n & Training Voucher Program and the All Iowa Opportunity Scholarship specifically for youth who aged out of the foster care system . Education and Training Voucher (ETV) Program: The ETV grant helps pay tuition and other school -related expenses for student s who have aged out of Iowa's foster care system, or students who were adopted after their 16th birthday. ETV is disbursed directly to the college or university where the student is enrolled. The college will use the funds to first pay outstanding amounts of tuition, fees, books and on -campus room and board charges. Once the student's campus account has been paid, any leftover funds will be issued to the student. All Iowa Opportunity Scholarship (AIOS): Students attending eligible Iowa colleges and universi ties will be eligible for funding. App lications will be accepted year - round , and money will be awarded until funds are depleted. Students will be notified by email of their application status. Step 3: Look for other grant and scholarship opportunities . Sources include your college or university, your high school, community groups, religious organizations, professional organizations and corporations. Your high school counselor can help you get started. Remember: You should never pay for a scholarship search , and you will never be asked to pay money up -front to \"guarantee\" a legitimate scholarship.

This list provides information about potential financial aid opportunities. Please note that the eligibility criterion varies. Some of the resources below pertain to adopted youth while others are targeted toward youth who emancipated from foster care. 1. Fostering Adoption to Further Student Achievement Act (Public Law 110- 84): This law made it possible for teens in foster care to be adopted without losing access to college financial aid. Under this law, youth who are adopted from foster care at any point after their 13th birthday will not have to include their parents' income in the calculation for determining their need for federal financial aid. The law revised the definition of \"independent student\" and the definition now extends to youth who were in foster care on or after their 13th birthday, even if they have subsequently been adopted (refer to question #52 on the FAFSA form. See the resource below on how to access FAFSA.). To learn more, visit: http://voice-for- adoption.org/sites/default/files/FAFSA%20factsheet_updated2010.pdf 2. Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA): Federal Student Aid, a part of the U.S. Department of Education, is the largest provider of student financial aid in the nation. At the office of Federal Student Aid, employees help make college education possible for every dedicated mind by providing more than $150 billion in federal grants, loans, and work-study funds each year to more than 15 million students paying for college or career school. Federal Student Aid is responsible for managing the student financial assistance programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. These programs provide grants, loans, and work-study funds to students attending college or career school. To complete a FAFSA application visit: http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/ 3. Chafee Education Training Vouchers (ETV) - Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act (Public Law 110-351): This law extended eligibility for Education Training Vouchers (ETV) to youth who exit foster care to kinship guardianship at age 16 or older (these funds are also available to youth who are adopted at age 16 or older). ETV is an annual federal grant provided to states to provide funds to former foster youth who are enrolled in college, university and vocational training programs.

There are typically two types of loans offered to students, subsidized and unsubsidized. Subsidized loans do not accrue interest while you are in school or during future deferment periods. While unsubsidized loans begin accruing interest from the time the loan is disbursed to the school. Students should never accept loans just because they are offered. Before agreeing to accept a loan students should discuss the need to take out loans with a representative at a school's financial aid office or some other knowledgeable parent or supportive adult.

Use a debit card ins tead of a credit card. Debit cards are limited to the amount of money held in your account. This helps you avoid overextending your budget. Avoid the tempting credit card offers you get in the mail. 2. Try to live as simply as possible during your college years. You will have years after you get your degree when you have more earning power to get the \"wants\". For now, focus on the \"needs\". 3.

Online - Some examples of job search websites are monster.com, snagajob.com, and craigslist.com. To find a list of these sites, go to a search engine (ex: Google) and type in keywords such as \"online job search sites\" and you should find a list of popular used sites. Also, check out company websites directly (e.g., Target.com, Homedepot.com). Helpful Hints: Sometimes job postings are listed under \"Careers\" or \"Human Resources.\" Visiting Businesses in Person - You can also visit a business in person to ask the hiring manager if they are accepting applications. Make sure you have your mock application with you in case you decide to fill out an application while you are there. Do Wear appropriat e clothe s such as: Button up shirts Blouses Dress pants or khakis Shoes Don't Wear: Short skirts, jeans or shorts Low cut shirts or anything too revealing Stained or wrinkled clothes Flip-flops Career Centers/Clubhouses/Employment Supports - Job support programs will help you with all the steps involved in getting and applying for jobs. The Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission is one vocational support in Massachusetts. Talk to your helpers (case managers, guidance counselors) for places to go. Networking - Ask around! Family members, friends and neighbors may know of places that are hiring. Filling Out Job Applications There are a few ways to apply to a job and separate businesses ask you to apply in different ways. If you know where you want to apply, call or go online and find out how that specific place wants you to fill out an application. **Make sure to have your mock application with you to fill out any job applications** On Paper - Applications on paper tend to be the shortest, and you are usually allowed to take them home to fill out, and bring back when you're done. Take 2 copies of the application if possible, in case you make any mistakes. 78 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Online - Some companies require filling out your application online. Here are some Helpful hints: * In order to fill out an application online, you will most likely need an e-mail address. You can get one free on websites such as yahoo, hotmail, etc. You will need to be able to check your e-mail by computer or cell phone. Make sure your e-mail address and voicemail message are PG and your cell phone has no background music. * Have all of your information ready before you start to fill in the application. Go through the application first to see what you need. * If you are filling out an application on a job search website (ex: monster.com), you may need to create an account. Make sure to keep your user name and password somewhere safe so you can go back and track your applications, and apply to other places later on. * Most online job applications give you the option to save the application and come back to it later. In Store - A lot of businesses are using what are called \"kiosks,\" which are computers that are located in the store that you must use to apply for the job. Helpful Hint: Bring someone along who can help you. Allow a good amount of time to fill kiosk applications out since they can be very long. After Applying Checking In: Don't get upset if you don't hear back from the place you applied to right away. Wait for about a week, and then call them and make sure they have your application, and ask if they have started interviews yet. Top Ten Interview Tips That Will Get You Hired! 1.

Some examples of what might be helpful to know about the company: It's Motto It's product and what makes them stand out It's competitors Recent news events It's senior management and their history with the company Taking the time to know the company you are interviewing with will benefit both you and the employ er. It can help you determine if this is the right job for you.

Dress flashy Slouch Swear Show up too early, exactly on time, or late Bring friends Be distracted Yawn Share too much personal information Drink an energy drink before the interview Don't forget! E-mail, Phone, and Internet Etiquette Check your e-mails daily You must be able to communicate the way that hiring managers communicate If it is hard to track you down or get ahold of you, employers will not go out of their way to do so. You must show that you are eager and interested in getting the job. When writing e -mails: - Alwa ys use a subject line. - Use full sentences, correct grammar, and punctuation. - Include a signature with your name and phone number at the end of each e--mail. - Have a professional e-mail address. Make sure your voicemail greeting is professional! - Make it simple or just have an automated message - no trick voicemails - no music (as a ring back or a voicemail) - CHECK YOUR VOICEMIAL and respond as soon as possible. Answering your phone: \"Hi, this is John\" Don't answer your phone if it's loud in the background and you can't talk. Internet searches ! - Many employers use the internet as a way to screen potential employees. Some things to keep in mind: - Google yourself - Facebook and other social media websites content - Don't post things on Facebook/Tw itter etc. that you wouldn't want an employer to see. www.teenforce.org/uploads/interview_tips.pdf 87 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) During the Interview Show self -confidence . Make eye contact with the interviewer and answer his /her questions in a clear voice. Work to establish a rapport with the interviewer. Remember to listen . Communication is a two -way street. If you are talking t oo much, you will probably miss cues concerning what the interviewer feels is important. Reflect before answering a difficult question . If you are unsure how to answer a question, you might reply with another question. For example, if the interviewer as ks you what salary you expect, try answering by saying \"That is a good question. What are you planning to pay your best candidate?\" When it is your turn, ask the questions you have prepared in advance . These should cover any information about the compan y and job position you could not find in your own research. Do not ask questions that raise red flags . Ask, \"Is relocation a requirement?\", and the interviewer may assume that you do not want to relocate at all. Too many questions about vacation may cau se the interviewer to think you are more interested in taking time off than helping the company. Make sure the interviewer understands why you are asking these questions. Show you want the job . Display your initiative by talking about what functions you could perform that would benefit the organization, and by giving specific details of how you have helped past employers. You might also ask about specific details of the job position, such as functions, responsibilities, who you would work with, and who you would report to. 88 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Making a Good Impressi on in Job Interviews Avoid negative body language . An interviewer wants to see how well you react under pressure. Avoid these signs of nervousness and tension: Frequently touching your mouth Faking a cough to think about the answer to a question Gnawing on your lip Tight or forced smiles Swinging your foot or leg Folding or crossing your arms Slouching Avoiding eye contact Picking at invisible bits of lint 89 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Common Interview Questions By rehearsing intervi ew questions, you'll become more familiar with your own qualifications and will be well prepared to demonstrate how you can benefit an employer. Some examples: \"Tell me about yourself.\" Make a short, organized statement of your education and professional achievements and professional goals. Then, briefly describe your qualifications for the job and the contributions you could make to the organization. You do not have to say you are in foster care. \"Why do you want to work here?\" or \"What about our compa ny interests you?\" Few questions are more important than these, so it is important to answer them clearly and with enthusiasm. Show the interviewer your interest in the company. Share what you learned about the job, the company and the industry through you r own research. Talk about how your professional skills will benefit the company. Unless you work in sales, your answer should never be simply: \"money.\" The interviewer will wonder if you really care about the job. \"Why did you leave your last job?\" The interviewer may want to know if you had any problems on your last job. If you did not have any problems, simply give a reason, such as relocated away from job; company went out of business; laid off; temporary job; no possibility of advancement; or wante d a job better suited to your skills. If you did have problems, be honest. Show that you can accept responsibility and learn from your mistakes. You should explain any problems you had (or still have) with an employer, but don't describe that employer in negative terms. Demonstrate that it was a learning experience that will not affect your future work. \"What are your best skills?\" If you have sufficiently researched the organization, you should be able to imagine what skills the company values. List th em, then give examples where you have demonstrated these skills. \"What is your major weakness?\" Be positive; turn a weakness into a strength. For example, you might say: \"I often worry too much over my work. Sometimes I work late to make sure the job i s done well.\" \"Do you prefer to work by yourself or with others?\" The ideal answer is one of flexibility. However, be honest. Give examples describing how you have worked in both situations. 90 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Common Interview Questions (continued) \"What are your care er goals?\" or \"What are your future plans?\" The interviewer wants to know if your plans and the company's goals are compatible. Let the interviewer know that you are ambitious enough to plan ahead. Talk about your desire to learn more and improve your pe rformance, and be specific as possible about how you will meet the goals you have set for yourself. \"What are your hobbies?\" and \"Do you play any sports?\" The interviewer may be looking for evidence of your job skills outside of your professional experie nce. For example, hobbies such as chess or bridge demonstrate analytical skills. Reading, music, and painting are creative hobbies. Individual sports show determination and stamina, while group sport activities may indicate you are comfortable working a s part of a team. Also, the interviewer might simply be curious as to whether you have a life outside of work. Employees who have creative or athletic outlets for their stress are often healthier, happier and more productive. \"What salary are you expec ting?\" You probably don't want to answer this one directly. Instead, deflect the question back to the interviewer by saying something like: \"I don't know. What are you planning on paying the best candidate?\" Let the employer make the first offer. Howe ver, it is still important to know what the current salary range is for the profession. Find salary surveys at the library or on the Internet, and check the classifieds to see what comparable jobs in your area are paying. This information can help you ne gotiate compensation once the employer makes an offer. \"What have I forgotten to ask?\" Use this as a chance to summarize your good characteristics and attributes and how they may be used to benefit the organization. Convince the interviewer that you under stand the job requirements and that you can succeed. 91 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Additional job interview questions you might want to rehearse : Your Qualifications What can you do for us that someone else can't do? What qualifications do you have that relate to the position? What new skills or capabilit ies have you developed recently? Give me an example from a previous job where you've shown initiative. What have been your greatest accomplishments recently? What is important to you in a job? What motivates you in your work? What have you been doing since your last job? What qualities do you find important in a coworker? Your Career Goals What would you like to being doing five years from now? How will you judge yourself successful? How will you achieve success? What type of position are you int erested in? How will this job fit in your career plans? What do you expect from this job? Do you have a location preference? Can you travel? What hours can you work? When could you start? Your Work Experience What have you learned from your past j obs? What were your biggest responsibilities? What specific skills acquired or used in previous jobs relate to this position? How does your previous experience relate to this position? What did you like most/least about your last job? Whom may we cont act for references? Your Education How do you think your education has prepared you for this position? What were your favorite classes/activities at school? Why did you choose your major? Do you plan to continue your education? 92 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) 93 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Illegal Job Interview Questions Various federal, state, and local laws regulate the questions a prospective employer can ask you. An employer's questions --on the job application, in the interview, or during the testing process --must be related to the job for which you are applying. For the employer, the focus must be: \"Wha t do I need to know to decide whether or not this person can perform the functions of this job?\" Options for Answering an Illegal Question You are free to answer the question. If you choose to do so, realize that you are giving information that is not j ob-related. You could harm your candidacy by giving the \"wrong\" answer. You can refuse to answer the question. By selecting this option you'll be within your rights, but you're also running the risk of coming off as uncooperative or confrontational --hardly the words an employer would use to describe the \"ideal\" candidate. Another option is to examine the intent behind the question and respond with an answer as it might apply to the job. For instance, if the interviewer asks, \"Are you a U.S. citizen?\" o r \"What country are you from?,\" you've been asked an illegal question. Instead of answering the question directly, you could respond, \"I am authorized to work in the United States.\" Or, if your interviewer asks, \"Who is going to take care of your childre n when you have to travel?\" you might answer, \"I can meet the travel and work schedule that this job requires.\" ILLEGAL QUESTIONS AND THE LEGAL COUNTERPARTS Subject Illegal Questions Legal Questions National Origin/ Citizenship Are you an U.S. citizen? Where were you/your parents born? What is your \"native tongue?\" Are you authorized to work in the United States? What languages do you read, speak or write fluently? (This question is okay, as long as this ability is relevant to the performance of the job.) Age How old are yo u? Are you over the age of 18? Personal How tall are you? How much do you weigh? Are you able to lift a 50 -pound weight and carry it 100 yards, as that is part of the job? (Questions about height and weight are not acceptable unless minimum standards are essential to the safe performance of the job.) Affiliations To what clubs or social organizations do you belong? Do you belong to any professional or trade groups or other organizations that you consider relevant to your abil ity to perform this job? Military If you've been in the military, were you honorably discharged? In what branch of the Armed Forces did you serve? What type of training or education did you receive in the military? 94 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Illegal Job Interview Questions (cont inued) Subject Illegal Questions Legal Questions Marital/ Family Status What's your marital status? Who do you live with? Do you plan to have a family? When? How many kids do you have? What are your child care arrangements? Would you be willing to relocate if necessary? Travel is an important part of the job. Would you be willing to travel as needed by the job (This question is okay, as long as ALL applicants for the job are asked it.) This job requires overtime occasionally. Would you be ab le and willing to work overtime as necessary? (Again, this questions okay as long as ALL applicants for the job are asked it.) Disabilities Do you have any disabilities? Please complete the following medical history. Have you had any recent or past i llnesses or operations? If yes, list and give dates. What was the date of your last physical exam? How's your family's health? When did you lose your eyesight? Are you able to perform the essential functions of this job with or without reasonable accommodations? (This question is okay if the interviewer thoroughly described the job.) NOTE: As part of the hiring process, after a job offer has been made you may be required to undergo a medical exam. Exam results must be kept strictly confidential, ex cept medical/safety personnel may be informed if emergency medical treatment is required, and supervisors may be informed about necessary job accommodations, based on the exam results. Arrest Record Have you ever been arrested? Have you ever been convicte d of _____? (The crime should be reasonably related to the performance of the job in question .) Talk to your JCO, about whether you need to disclose any juvenile crimes. In the future, you may also request that your juvenile record be sealed. Remember your criminal history is online so an employer can look it up. 95 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Questions You Might Ask During a Job Interview At the end of most interviews, you will be invited to ask questions of your interviewer. This is an important opportunity for you to learn mo re about the employer, and for the interviewer to further evaluate you as a job candidate. It requires some advance preparation on your part. Here are some guidelines for asking questions: Prepare five good questions . Understanding that you may not ha ve time to ask them all. Ask questions concerning the job, the company, and the industry or profession. A few questions you might ask include \"What opportunities exist for advancement?\" or \"Are there opportunities for travel?\". Your questions should ind icate your interest in these subjects and that you have read and thought about them. For example, you might start, \"I read in Business Week that ... I wonder if that factor is going to have an impact on your business ?\". Don't ask questions that raise war ning flags . For example, asking, \"Would I really have to work weekends?\" implies that you are not available for weekend assignments. If you are available, rephrase your question. Also, avoid initiating questions about compensation (pay, vacations, etc.) or tuition reimbursements. You might seem more interested in paychecks or time -off than the actual job. Find out what the salary range is for the job before your interview. Don't ask questions about only one topic . People who ask about only one topic are often perceived as one -dimensional and not good candidates. Clarify . It's okay to ask a question to clarify something the interviewer said. Just make sure you are listening. Asking someone to clarify a specific point makes sense. Asking someone t o re-explain an entire subject gives the impression that you have problems listening or understanding. For example, you can preface a clarifying question by saying: \"You mentioned that ABC Company does . Can you tell me how that works in practice?\" 96 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Common Interview Mistakes The following is important to know not to do at the job interview. Learn from the mistakes of others. Here's \"18 Deadly Interview Mistakes Job Seekers Make,\" adapted from Drs. Caryl and Ron Krannich's 101 Dynamite Answers to Interview Questions . 18 Interview Mistakes Job Seekers Make DON'T: 1. Arrive late for the interview. 2. Indicate you are l ate because the directions you were given were not good. 3. Look disheveled and inappropriately dressed. 4. Slouch in your seat. 5. Look around. You should maintain good eye contact with the interviewer. 6. Research the company at the interview by asking, \"What do you guys do here?\" 7. Forget to make a connection between your skills and the needs of the employer. 8. Brag about how great you are. 9. Respond in an unfocused, disorganized, and rambling manner. 10. Remain low -key and display no enthusiasm for the job. 11. Answer most questions with simple \"yes\" and \"no\" answers. 12. Appear desperate for a job --any job. 13. Call the interviewer by his or her first name, or use the wrong name. 14. Give memorized responses. 15. Badmouth your current or former employer. 16. Ask, \"How am I doing? Are you going to hire me?\" 17. Blurt out, \"I need to make at least $35,000. I hope this job pays at least that much,\" near the beginning of the interview. 18. Reply \"No\" when asked, \"Do you have any questions?\" . When the interview is over, DO: Ask when to expect a decision to be made. Make sure the employer knows how to reach you. Follow -up the interview with a thank -you letter to the employer restating your interest in the position . Learn from the interview proces s. If you don't get the job, rejection is part of any normal job search . Keep searching until you secure employment. Tell 97 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) The Word on Work, Tip Sheet 7 Do I Tell My Boss?: Disclosing My Mental Health Condition at Work Transition s RTC 2012 What Should I Say About My Mental Health Condition at Work? Every young adult with a mental health condition will face the decision of whether or not to tell others about, or \"disclose\" their condition at work. Typically the reason for disclosure is to ask for an accommodation in order to perform better at your present job. An accommodation is modifying a job, the job site, or the way things are done in order to enable a qualified individual with a disability to have an equal opportunity for employment.1 The following information can provide some guidance in helping you make an informed decision. Some Reasons to Disclose Having a Mental Health Condition on the Job: Some Reasons Not to Disclose Having a Mental Health Condition on the Job: To obtain protection under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)1 Required in order to request job accommodations2 To serve as a role model and educate others Reduces stigma Relieves the stress some may feel about \"hiding\" a disability Makes employers better able to respond to sudden symptoms or hospitalizations Disclosure to a supervisor is kept confidential by law There is no need for accommodations Hiring or promotion chances may be negatively affected due to stigma To protect your privacy Fear of: - Negative employer or coworker reactions to you or your work - People not respecting your privacy and confidentiality (others in community/ workplace will be told) - Being held to a different standard, i.e., less will be expected of you If I Want to Disclose, How Should I Do It? Let your employer know you have a medical disability. Steer clear of medical terms and a specific diagnosis. Instead provide examples of how your disability affects you i.e., \"I have a medical condition that affects my concentration.\" You will need to provide information about the existence and extent of your disability or diagnosis, how your condition may limit your functioning in the job, and the accommodations that address these barriers. YOU DO NOT need to disclose your entire medical record, progress notes or tests, etc. Focus on your abilities, not disabilities. Prepare and practice what you will say ahead of time. List your strengths and qualifications related to this job. You can also give examples of how your experiences with a disability will positively affect your work performance. Share what issues you may face in the workplace due to your diagnosis and try to word it in a positive way. For example, \"My disability requires me to take frequent breaks in order for me to stay productive.\" 98 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) You should engage in an \"informal interactive process\" with your employer and provide a specific list or a written statement that summarizes the disability and accommodations that would help you at this job.2 Inform your employer of an action plan that works best for your safety if you become unwell at work. Some employers may have policies and processes in place for disclosure, which may be helpful to look over and potentially use. If I Want to Disclose, When Should I Do It? There is no exact point in time that is best to disclose, however, each has its advantages and disadvantages. You have the right to disclose at any time during your employment. You also have the right not to disclose. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)1 states that employers cannot ask questions that will likely reveal the existence of a disability before making a job offer. SOME TIMES YOU CAN DISC LOSE PROS OF DISC LOSURE AT THAT POINT IN TIME CONS OF DISC LOSURE AT THAT POINT IN TIME In a cover letter/ resume/ job application Shows honesty, gives the opportunity to prepare a written statement including your abilities Employer may have pre-conceived opinions on disabilities and may not offer you an interview Before an Interview You can discuss the accommodations that you may need during an interview2 May affect the interview process and how you are viewed due to stigma During the interview Opportunity to discuss strengths and how disability will positively affect employment Can interact with people and flexibly respond to questions/concerns May affect the interview process and how you are viewed due to stigma Once hired Avoids possibility of discrimination during the hiring process. Secure accommodations and coverage under the ADA1 May affect how your job duties and assignments are handled due to stigma During Employment You may find that you will need accommodations once you've been at the job for a while You may want to wait until you form a relationship with your boss, prove your abilities and feel confident with your job. Disclosing enables you to have a conversation with your boss. Hopefully you are perceived as a valued worker and they will be motivated to make adjustments in order to keep you. May affect co-workers responses to you May affect how your performance is evaluated by the employer May affect promotional opportunities After Performance Difficulties Arise If you become sick or hospitalized you may need to request time off, so you will need to inform your workplace. Your employer may feel betrayed, wonder why you waited so long, and look at it as an excuse for bad performance. Footnotes 1. Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Pub. L.

You are only required to share disability information with the person/s in the workplace who is involved with approving or providing accommodations. You can choose whether or not to tell other people at the workplace. An employment specialist or counselor may be able to help you determine who that might be. Some examples of types of disclosure include: Full Disclosure: Being open with everyone at work (bosses and coworkers) about your mental health condition, including details and your diagnosis. Note: not all coworkers will understand, and some may resent accommodations. Targeted Disclosure: Telling specific people such as: - Your immediate boss /supervisor if they will be the one providing accommodations and support. - A higher level manager such as your immediate supervisor/boss's manager. - The human resources manager who can help you with legal rights, health insurance, medical leave, etc. - A job coach or transition youth advocate who may represent you if you are uncomfortable/unable to disclose yourself. - Your co-workers who may be able to provide informal supports. Note: The ADA requires your employer to keep all information about your disability confidential. Keep in mind when disclosing disability-related information to co-workers, that they are not held to the same standard. Inadvertent Disclosure: Others find out about your condition without you telling anybody. Think About \"Cyber Disclosure\" When Using Social Media Sites! With sites like Facebook and Twitter becoming increasingly popular, you may find yourself sharing a lot of information about yourself, and disclosing your mental health condition online without realizing it. Here are some tips to avoid inadvertent cyber disclosure: Know what information about you is available for all to see online. Do a check by entering your name every few months into search engines (Google) to see what information comes up. Check the privacy settings on any site you may be a part of i.e., Facebook. You can make your profile private so only the friends you choose can see your page, photos, and specific information. Double check that you have made each part of your profile private. Realize that others, including employers, may see information you post that could relate to you having a mental health condition i.e., awards you received from mental health organizations or memberships in self advocacy groups, etc. During employment, review your rights and privacy laws when it comes to using work computers. You should assume that any work equipment is the employer's, not yours, and you have no privacy on that equipment. For example, some organizations have public e-mail that can be looked at by request of your employer.

This form authorizes your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from each paycheck for federal taxes. This is called \"withholding\" and is something employers must do by law. Your employer can help you if you don't unders tand how to complete the form. If you are under age 18 you may choose to write exempt which would prevent withholdings from being taken out of your paycheck. If you move, inform your employer that you need to change your W4 to reflect your new address, a s this is where your statement of earnings will be sent. At the end of this section there is an Iowa W4 and a Federal W4 that you can practice completing.

You must have these forms in order to complete your tax returns. If you have moved in the past year, be sure your previous employers know how to get in touch with you. When you receive your W2 forms you should file your Federal and State tax forms. The IRS can help you with your taxes if your use th e \"short form\". The IRS does not charge a fee for this service. If you choose to go to a private tax firm, they will charge you a fee. Electronic filing is available to you since your taxes are not very complicated yet.

However, there are healthy ways to deal with this stress. This sheet has some tips to help you be more prepared to start and keep a new job, and hopefully be a little less stressed. You Are Not Alone Make sure you have people to talk to. Create a list of your supports. These peop le can be anyone that you talk to when you have problems: friends, family, te achers, role models, coworkers, church members, online friends. You may be surprised ho w many people can relate to how you are feeling right now. Know the Rules Before You Begin Most companies have a clear policy or handbook on many of these questions. Take the time to review it, and sit down with your boss to ask questions if any part of it is not clear before you begin working. Questions to ask Cell Phones - Are they allowed at work? What about texting? Computer Use - Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites are generally not appropriate while at work, check the policy. How do I request or schedule time off? o How long do you have to work before you have personal time? o Do you have to find someone to cover for you? o Do you need to call a certain amount of time before your shift? Breaks - When do I get them? Where do I take them? What are the rules? Is there a unif orm or dress code? Overtime - What are the rules? Is it in the Handbook? What are the guidel ines for workplace relationships? Trainings o Is there orientation training where policy and procedures are reviewed? o Mandatory vs. Voluntary - (What trainings do I have to go to and which are optional?) o Are there ways to advance your career? o What trainings are paid for by the company? What trainings are non-paid? Harassment - What is it and what is the policy? Raises - How are they given? Probation Period - What does this mean? How long is it? * If you are wondering if you should disclose your mental health condition on the job, please see the tip sheet, \"Do I Tell My Boss\" at: http://labs.umassmed.edu/transitionsRTC/Resources/publications/Tipsheets_and_Briefs.html How to Succeed Once You Begin Here are suggestions to help you keep your job and avoid some mistakes people make when they start a new job. Keep track of your schedule\u2014make an extra copy to keep in a safe place. Arrive on time - being late frequently will get you fired. If you are late once, explain why. Plan ahead o How are you going to get to and from work? 110 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) o What's a backup plan to get to work? o What should you do in an emergency? Know your job description o Just like an employee handbook, most jobs have a job description. o Review your job description carefully and ask your supervisor any questions. o Let your supervisor know if there are tasks that you aren't able to complete. Use Your Supe rvision Time Well Having supervisi on does not mean you are in trouble. Some bosses schedule time to meet with employees. Use this time to ask questions, build skills and be curious. Your boss does not expect you to know everything; it is ok to ask questions. There are no dumb questions. If your boss does not regularly schedule supervision, ask him or her if he or she could give you a few minutes each week to discuss how you are doing. Ask them what you are doing well, what they would like to see you change, and make an effort to apply this information to your work. It's ok to ask your boss for help with difficult situations (such as with customers, co-workers, etc.). Take Care of Yourself You can't be a good employee if you do not take care of yourself. Live a healthy lifestyle. Get enough sleep. Take care of any health issues you may have. Just as important is taking care of your emotional health. o Schedule time to do the things that you enjoy o Spend time with the people you love o Don't stop doing the activities you love, work them into your schedule responsibly o Reach out to people who care about you: friends, family, mentors, church members, counselors, etc. Reasons That Could Cause You to Lose Your Job Being late Being rude Breaking the company rules Lying Using drugs or alcohol on the job Not being flexible Not showing up Stealing Being unprofessional (language, dress/hygiene, or sharing too much) Badmouthing the company (to other coworkers/on social medi a) Generally, you want to give your job advanced warning if you plan to qu it, so you can leave on good terms. Most employers expect at least a two -week notice, b ut more can be he lpful. Be honest and pol ite when telling your boss why you're leaving . Be careful about speaking negatively abo ut former employers or coworkers when you leave a job. Doing the above can he lp you get a good reference from a past employer f or future jobs.

Have you thought about where will you live when you leave foster care? Talk with your social worker who can help you evaluate the pros and cons of options you are considering. There are many types of housing options. You could live with your relatives, friends, in a house, a duplex, an apartment complex, an efficiency apartment, rent a room, or use a housing program.

Transitional Living Programs There are programs in the state of Iowa that have received Federal grants to provide housing and services to homeless youth between the ages of 16 and 21.

To demonstrate need, the youth must provide evidence that the he/she is responsible for paying more than 30% of their gross earned and unearned income for rent and that they cannot obtain other rental assistance beca use they have been determined ineligible or is on a waiting list for rent subsidy under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or any other available rent subsidy program, or because a waiting list for the HUD rent subsidy program or an y other rent subsidy program is closed. This program may not be used to substitute for any other subsidy that the youth had been receiving at the time of or immediately prior to the time of application to this program. Youth receiving rental assistance at the time of or immediately prior to the time of application to this program shall not be eligible. Education on renter rights and responsibilities. To demonstrate that the youth understands the rights and responsibilities of being a renter, the youth must have either lived in a transitional apartment (through the Aftercare Services Transitional Apartment program), completed a renter education and awareness program, be enrolled to participate or be currently participating in a renter education and awareness program. Budget. The youth must submit a budget that demonstrates that the subsidy, when combined with their gross earned an d unearned income, will enable them to cover all remaining living expenses (i.e., housing, utilities, clothing and food). Amount of Rent Subsidy Assistance shall be used for rental expense directly related to the youth's lease of a rental unit. The monthly payment shall be for a rental unit with one bedroom or a proportionate share of rental costs in units containing more than one bed room.

Find out how much the gas, electric, cable, and phone companies charge for deposits and for hookup . These will be charged before you move in. Your best bet for trying to find an apartment will be friends or co -workers. Start by asking if anyone needs a roommate. Next best would be searching online or the classified ads in the local newspaper . Some cities have apartment guides that you get from convenience stores. If you sign a lease, look very carefully at the section that deals with deposits a nd last months rent. A partments often ask for a deposit and the first and last months rent in advance. If you leave the apartment before the lease ends, or if you leave the apartment in bad condition, you could lose both of these. Get everythi ng written in the lease. Ask questions before you sign!!! The landlord should pay for repair of plumbing, air conditioning/heating, major appliances that come with the apartment and electric wiring, unless the damage is caused by abuse. If you put a hole in the wall, damage a window, door, or floor, you will have to pay to have these fixed or lose your deposit when you leave. It is a good idea to take a photo of the condition of the apartment before you move in. If you are looking at an apartment complex , try to get an apartment close to laundry and other facilities, but not overlooking the dumpster. Find out what late penalties are assessed if you pay the rent late. Find out if there is a pet deposit , and what pets are allowed. Understand that if they are not allowed, you could be evicted and charged a fine if you bring in a pet. Never sign a lease without very carefully walking through the entire apartment, checking for damage or problems. Never sign a lease for an apartment after just looking at the model apartment. Write down (and take photos) of what damage is already in the apartment and have the landlord sign and date it, so you are not responsible for these damages when you move out . The best would be to write these on the lease and have the la ndlord initial each damaged item . Find out what rules and regulations the apartment has about noise, friends, or other restrictions. Is the apartment close to buses , or other types of transportation? What noises or smells are around the apartment? Is it a safe neighborhood, do the windows close and lock, a re there any trains close, etc.? 121 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Resource from: YOUNG ADULT'S GUIDE TO HOUSING, A tool developed by the JOHN BURTON FOUNDATION APPLICATIO N PREPARATIO N FOR M1 Identifying information (this information shou ld be obtained for all househo ld members) Housing (Use the back of the form or a sepa rate page to record additional housing history.

This can include ques tions abou t prior evictions, credit history and/or criminal backg round . It is important to be prepared for these ques tions before speak ing to the landlord. You shou ld know their response s even before making the initial phon e call as some landlords will do preliminary screening on the telephone. Here are some tips to keep in mind when preparing answers: Be prepared - Know what is on your credit and backg round reports and have explanations prepared before going to meet with a landlord so that they are not caugh t by surprise. Determine whether any juven ile conv ictions will show up on a criminal backg round check . It can be helpful to practice respon ses out loud before meeting with a landlord. This will help you to be confident when the time comes to explain any nega tive history. Be hones t: Even if you have a good explanation for prior incidents, if you lie abou t them and are found out, in almost all case s this will result in an automatic rejection. Be conc ise - It is important to be truthful and explain what happened , however it is not necessa ry to go into great detail abou t the circumstance s of unpa id bills, evictions or criminal conv ictions. Be positive - Determine what has change d since the nega tive incident(s) occu rred. What is different now that gives you confidenc e that a similar incident wouldn't happe n again? What could be said that has been gained as a result of the consequence s of previous actions? How have your goals and priorities changed? You shou ld emphas ize the ways in which you have demonstrated financ ial respons ibility and positive behav ior recen tly. Be proactive - Compile written letters of recommenda tion or have the names and phon e numbers of reference s that can be presen ted to the landlord as evidenc e that the applicant will be a good tenan t. Letters can come from former landlords, employers or places that you volunteer, or case manage rs. (Reference s from persona l friends are not gene rally as helpful). 124 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Searching for the Right Place Before you decide to move into an apartment, be sure to check out the options available to you in your community. Remember to get the name of the utility companies that provide servic e to the address you are looking at. Be sure to check for working smoke alarms and fire extinguishers. Below is a place you can record your comparisons to help you make that important decision.

Before you take any action on a disagreement with your landlord, check out the laws of your state. In Iowa check out websites : http://www.hud.gov/local/ia/renting/tenantrights.cfm https://www.iowalegalaid.org/issues/housing/landlord -and-tenant -issues https://ipropertymanagement.com/laws/iowa when r enting? When you rent another person's property, treat it as you would want people to treat it if you owned it. Following this rule will not only help your landlord, but it will also benefit you. You can assure a good credit rating and a good reference and a return of your security deposit when you want to move somewhere else. The impressions you make on others often show up in unexpected places, so a good image is always helpful. Being a Good Neighbor Keep the unit clean and safe. Get rid of all you r trash in a clean and safe manner. Do not disturb other renters with loud noises, rude guests, or bad manners. Do not use the premises for unlawful purposes. If pets are allowed, don't let them disturb neighbors, create offensive odors, or destroy propert y. If you share laundry facilities, keep your laundry moving and not sitting in the machines. If parking spaces are provided, use your assigned one. Being a Good Tenant Do not destroy or damage any part of the unit. Understand and follow all the rules s et up in your lease. Use all appliances, plumbing, and electrical and heating facilities in a safe way. Keep the un it clean . Pay your rent and utilities promptly when due. Inform your landlord in a writing when you plan to move. Report all problems with yo ur unit to the landlord, including ones you may have caused. 130 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Setting Up Your Apartment Castoffs and treasures from attics and garage sales can make attractive furnishings for your new living space. They may not look like they fit together, but time and imagination can create miracles! You may even be able to purchase some new things. Put them all together with your own values, style, personality, lifestyle, and budget. Since you won't start out with a big budget, you'll need to plan ways to cut costs. The following are a few low cost ideas that might work for you: Shop second hand stores, consignment shops, and garage sales. Paint and refinish used furniture. Use flat bed sheets and spring rods for curtains. Use flat bed sheets to cover torn or stai ned upholstery. Build shelves with board s and brick s. Get donations from family, relatives, or friends.

There are seve ral things that you shou ld keep in mind in order to avoid putting your hous ing at risk. A. General Good Practices Pay rent on time Paying rent on the day that it is due is very important to maintaining hous ing. If the landlord charges a late fee, it can cost a lot of money if the rent is routinely paid late. Paying rent on time will also keep you in good standing with your landlord. Tenan ts shou ld keep in mind that a landlord is legally entitled to serve a \"3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit,\" which is the first step towards an eviction as soon as a tenan t is late with the rent. You shou ld also be aware that if you are frequen tly paying rent late, that can be ground s for an eviction even if you always pay even tually. Also keep in mind, that if you have roommates and your roommates don't pay their rent, you can be evicted. Pay bills on time It is important to pay utility bills such as gas, electric and water on time each month. Thes e services will charge a late fee if payments are not made on time which can add up quickly and cost a cons iderable amount of money . Unpaid bills may also show up on your credit report and affect your ability to get hous ing in the future. If the utility is turned off, you may have to pay a fee to get it turned on again. Obey the terms of the lease The lease likely desc ribes some basic expec tations that the landlord has of all tenan ts such as not disturbing other tenan ts, not damaging the property and not engag ing in illegal activities on the property. If you violate any of these rules, you can be evicted from your apartment. Following these guidelines will also help to maintain good relationsh ips with the neighbo rs. Some tips to remember are: Keep noise to a minimum espec ially during hours when peop le are sleeping. If you are living in an apartment building and share walls with other units or have a unit directly abov e or below others, you shou ld be espec ially aware of the impact you may be having. It can be helpful for you to give neighbo rs your contact information so that the neighbo rs can communicate if they are being disturbed by noise. Do not make any alterations to a unit without the landlord's permission. Monitor the behav ior of your gues ts and do not have too many visitors. Don't allow visitors to roam around the building. Do not engag e in illegal activity on the premises or allow gues ts to do so. Do not allow others who are not on the lease to move in with you. Take out the trash and recycling regularly and keep your unit clean. Avoid leaving out items such as food that may attract insec ts or roden ts. If you have a pet, ensu re the pet is properly cared for and cleane d up after. Leav e the hallways and corridors clear of items and make sure your unit is not attracting pests such as cock roache s or mice. 134 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) B. Maintaining a Good Relationship with the Landlord Maintaining communication with the landlord is key to maintaining hous ing. Here are some examples of situations that shou ld prompt you to get in touch with the landlord: Maintenanc e issue s in the apartment - If something breaks or stops working, or there are other problems with the unit such as mold, plumbing problems or pests, contact your landlord right away. While tenan ts are respons ible to chang e a or unclog a toilet when necessa ry, neve r try to make complex repairs without discuss ing it with the landlord first. If a landlord is unrespons ive, docu ment reques ts by writing a letter to the landlord. Make sure to keep copies of all letters sent and received. If the landlord continues to be unrespons ive contact a tenan t assistance agency . Tip: Never stop paying rent because a landlord is not making necessar y repairs unless advised to do so by an attorney or advocate who specializes in tenant/landlord law. If you need to change the lock - The landlord is entitled to have a key to the unit in case they need to enter the unit due to an emergency or to make repairs. If you need to change the lock for security reasons or add an additional lock, alert t he landlord before making the change and be sure to provide the landlord with a key to the new lock. Maintenance issues in common areas - If there are repair issue s in common spac e such as burned out light bulbs in hallways or a broken intercom system, these are the respons ibility of the landlord and you shou ld alert them of the problem right away. Problems with Neighbors - If you have a problem with a neighbo r such as excess ive noise, visible trash or other issues , and feel comfortable doing so, try to resolve the issue directly with t he neighbo r. If it canno t be resolved or the neighbo r is particularly problematic, alert the landlord to t he problem. Always avoid getting in a fi ght with a neighbo r or respond ing to a problem by doing something to get back at the neighbo r. This will li kely make the situation worse, and could result in a l oss of housing. Rent Problems - If for some reaso n you are late with t he rent, inform the landlord and let them know w hen you expec t to be able to pay. If the landlord knows w hat is going on, they are more likely to give some leeway, whereas if you make the landlord chas e you down, the landlord is l ess likely to be willing to w ork with you. If you are unab le to pay your rent you shou ld cons ider moving out of the unit in order to avoid an eviction. If you end up getting evicted, this will go on your record for the next seve n years and will make it harder to get hous ing in t he future. Tip: If you ever receive any type of legal paperwork from your landlord, do not ignore it. Take it to a tenant assistance agency right away to determine how to respond . Waiting even a few days can mean the difference between keeping and losing housing. If you want to make changes to a unit: If you want to m ake change s to your unit such as painting walls a different color, always consu lt the landlord before making them. If you don't, you may lose you deposit when it comes time to m ove out or could be evicted for violating the lease. When things change: If t here are any significant change s that affect a househo ld such as someone moving in or out, you shou ld alert your landlord. 135 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) C. Problems with the Landlord If you feel like the landlord is not treating you fairly, breaking the law or is not respond ing to reques ts there are a number of agenc ies that can assist tenan ts with this. You can often find information abou t local tenan ts' rights Tenan ts shou ld neve r withhold rent from their landlord without consu lting with one of these agenc ies first. Living with a landlord who is not making necessa ry repairs can be very frustrating, but not paying rent is more likely to get a person evicted than to get the repairs made. D. Eviction Whether or not a landlord has a right to evict you varies depend ing on what city you live in. In some cities, a landlord can only evict a tenan t for certain spec ific reasons . In other cities the landlord does not need a reaso n to ask a tenan t to leave who is unde r a month to month rental agreement or whose lease has expired. Evictions for Cause If you live in a city that requires \"good cause \" to evict, the landlord can gene rally only evict you if you don't pay your rent or if you violate the terms of the lease (such as creating a nuisance , not keep ing the unit clean, disturbing other tenan ts, engag ing in illegal activity, etc.). In either of these case s the landlord can give a \"3- day Notice.\" At the end of the three days if the tenan t has not addresse d the problem (either paid the rent or stoppe d the problematic behav ior), the landlord can serve an eviction notice, known as an \"Unlawful Detainer.\" If you have damaged the property, subs tantially interfered with other tenan ts or used the apartment for unlawful purpose s (such as selling drugs) the landlord does not have to offer a chanc e to stop the behav ior. If you get served with an Unlawful Detainer, this will go on your record for the next seve n years and will make it harder for you to get hous ing in the future, so it is very important to try to avoid this happen ing. If you receive an eviction notice you can attempt to fight the eviction or you may want to cons ider moving out. As mentioned above , having an eviction on your record could have serious consequence s for the future. The landlord may be willing to work out an agreement with you where the landlord will agree to give you 30 or 60 days to move out if you agree to leave by the agreed upon dead line. This will give you some time to find a new place and avoid having to go through an eviction process . Evictions Without Cause If the landlord is not required to give a reason , they still have to give written notice. If everyone living in the unit has been there for more than one year, the landlord must give 60-days notice. If the tenan ts have been there for less than a year or in some case s if the landlord has sold the property to someone who plans to move in, they only need to give 30-days notice. If you believe the landlord is trying to evict you illegally you shou ld contact a local tenan t's rights organization. Tip: If you receive any type of legal notice saying that you need to move out take it to a tenant referral agency right away. Waiting even a few days can mean the difference between keeping and losing housing. E. Moving Out Well If you decide to move out of the unit, there are a number of steps that shou ld be taken to leave the unit respons ibly. This will help ensu re both that you can get back the secu rity depos it that was paid upon move 136 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) in and that the landlord will give a good reference when you're looking for hous ing in the future. The following shou ld be kept in mind when it is time to leave . $ Check the lease /rental agreement to make sure you are not vaca ting the property before the lease expires. A lease is a legally binding contract. If you must move out before the lease expires, shou ld discuss the circumstance s with the landlord in advanc e and see unde r what circumstance s the landlord may be willing to allow the tenan t to break the lease . $ Make sure to give 30 days notice in writing or whatever other notice is required in the lease . If you do not, the landlord is entitled to keep the depos it to pay for a month's rent even if you have moved out. $ When leaving, take everything with you. If there are items that they no longe r want, they shou ld be dispose d of. Never leave trash or old furniture for the landlord to get rid of. $ Thorough ly clean the apartment including cleaning the floors, carpets, walls, closets, fixtures and appliances . Give particular attention to the bathrooms, stove, oven , and refrigerator. The landlord is allowed to keep the depos it to pay the cost of cleaning the unit if it is not cleane d well enough. $ If there is damage to the unit that you caused , make sure that it is repaired before moving out. This can include patching holes where pictures were hung . $ Coordinate with the landlord to do a final inspec tion. You can use the move in/move out check list that was completed when they first moved in. $ Leav e contact information with the landlord so that the landlord can forward any mail and knows where to send the depos it refund. $ Return all keys to the landlord including mail box key. $ Notify your social worker and other important agenc ies of a new mailing address. Fill out a forwarding address form with the Post Office as well. $ Discon tinue all utilities, phon e and cable service. F. Getting Back the Security Deposit California law has very spec ific requirements abou t how secu rity depos its must be hand led when a tenan t moves out. It allows the landlord to use a security depos it for four purposes : For unpa id rent; For cleaning the rental unit when the tenan t moves out, but only to make the unit as clean as it was when the tenan t first moved in; For repair of damages , other than normal wear and tear, cause d by the tenan t gues ts; and If the lease or rental agreement allows it, for the cost of restoring or replacing furniture, furnishings, or other items of persona l property (including keys ), other than becaus e of normal wear and tear. The landlord has 21 calenda r days after a tenan t moves out to refund the depos it. If the landlord withholds money from the depos it they are required to send an itemized statement of what the money was used for and copies of receipts for any work done . If you believe that the landlord has improperly withheld money from a depos it after move out you shou ld contact one a legal assistance agency . 137 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) SECTION 5 SELF CARE & HEALTH Information concerning your health is vital to have at your fingertips. You can keep track of your important medical information with the assistance of this organized section. Contents in this section can include the items listed in the box. Staying Healthy Health Insurance -Medicaid Disability Information Mental Health Making Healthy Choices Integrat ed Health Services Transportation for Medical Appointments Illnesses & Medical Conditions Immunization Record Hospitalization History Hearing , Vision, & Dental Information Personal Hygiene Family Medical History LGBTQ + Healthy Relationships Pregnancy Preve ntion & STI 's Human Trafficking Smoking , Substance Abuse Plan Your Health/Live Your Life Durable Power Of Attorney 138 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) 475 ( 7/20) Staying Healthy Before you moved out on your own, someone else probably made dental and doctor appointments for you and made s ure you received regular medical care. With so many things to think about when you go out on your own, it might be easy to forget about medical care. However, if you want to stay healthy you need to take good care of yourself. You should have regular ph ysical exams, including pelvic exams if you are female and regular dental and eye exams. * Remember when you move you will need to find a new doctor. Your records can be transferred. It is important to ask when making an appointment, what insurance cove rage is accepted. Make sure your current doctor has all your medical history. If you have been in foster care, your social worker or JCO may be able to help you obtain your medical information. There are places in this section that you can write down th e information you locate or put information into the protective sleeve or file folder included. Your local county health department can offer many quality medical services for free or based on a sliding fee scale. Do not ignore your medical needs even if your budget cannot afford sliding fee scales. Contact your local DHS for assistance or referrals to agencies that might help you. Preventative maintenance is the best policy in having good health. Eating right, exercising, and getting plenty of rest is the best thing you can do for yourself. Remembering to use proper hand washing techniques when you are ill or if you are around sick people is another way to avoid spreading germs and staying healthy. A balanced diet is the basis for staying healthy, but eating those nutritious meals isn't always easy. Be aware that convenience or bad habits often interfere with good eating habits so you may need to readjust your daily routine to become health -conscious. But a balanced diet doesn't always mean you give up the foods you enjoy -especially if you use a little self -discipline. Health Insurance If you are in foster care, you have Medicaid ( Title 19) for your health insurance. Your parents may also have medical coverage for you. When you leave foster care on or after age 18, you may qualify for Medicaid (Title XIX) until you turn 2 6 years old. Your e ligibility to continue Medicaid will be determined automatically when you leave care. You need to give your social worker or JCO your forwarding address so you w ill continue to receive your card. You must report your new address whenever you move. Once during each year, you will receive a review form to make sure you still meet the income guidelines for Title XIX. It is very important to return this review form right away or your medical coverage will stop. If this happens, you must complete a Health Services Application at your local DHS office. Your employer may offer you health insurance, so be sure to check into it when you start, as there may be a deadli ne to apply for it. 142 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Expanded Medicaid for Youth Aging Out of Foster Care \"E-MIYA\" Former foster youth may be eligible for Expanded Medicaid for Independent Young Adults (E-MIYA) , until they reach the age of 26. Youth who age out in foster care und er Iowa's responsibility will be eligible for E -MIYA up to age 26 without regard to income if they had federally funded Iowa Medicaid at age 18 and other requirements are met. The youth must meet other eligibility requirements such as citizenship or ali en status, and Iowa residency. Eligible youth will be automatically enrolled for either E -MIYA when they exit foster care. Youth who are not currently receiving Medicaid may apply by completing the new Application for Health Coverage and Help Paying Cost s as stated below. Health care applications received will be screened for potential eligibility under E -MIYA based on how the applicant responds to the question \"were you in foster care at 18 or older\". The key to youth being considered for the ACA fost er care Medicaid expansion \"E- MIYA\" group is that they answer \"Yes\" to this question. Those in \"relative or suitable other placement\" must have been receiving Iowa Medicaid and at the time they aged out (before age 18) in order to qualify for E -MIYA. Continued eligibility for E -MIYA will be reviewed annually. For this review, DHS will use information already in the file to see if it matches data from federal and state sources. If DHS is able to determine that eligibility continues by reviewing avai lable information, the youth will not have to return a review form. If DHS needs more information, a review form will be sent so the youth can provide more information to see if Medicaid coverage can continue. As long as the youth provides any requested information, DHS will automatically look at all available coverage groups to see if the youth remains eligible for Medicaid. People who didn't get automatically enrolled for some reason or who lost eligibility can apply: Electronically at the health in surance marketplace Web site at www.healthcare.gov or by calling 1 -800-318-2596 (TTY 1 -855-889-4325). Applications for those who may be eligible for Medicaid will be routed to Iowa's DHS for a Medicaid determinatio n. Electronically at the DHS website at www.dhs.iowa.gov or at https://dhsservices.iowa.gov/apspssp/ssp.portal By submitting an application in person , by mail, by e -mail, or f ax to a Department office.

If you feel depr essed, stressed out, or are just n ot \"feeling good about yourself ,\" reach out and ask for help. You might find talking to a friend would help. If you feel you need more than this call your local mental health department or crisis center. Almost everyone needs to ask for help at some point in his or her life. You may learn the answer is as simple as becoming involved with a volunteer group or helping someone else. You may need more exercise, creative outlets, or ways to relax to help you cope with the f rustrations that arise with everyday life. You may need a chance to talk about your past or about future plans. Remember that everyone needs to rely on others. We need the support of our family and friends the rest of our lives regardless of how old, we althy, or wise we become. 145 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Integrated Health Home Services If you have mental or physical health needs, you may qualify for a program cal led Integrated Health Services... 146 Comm. 475 The NEMT services are for members with full Medica id benefits, who need travel reimbursement or a ride to get to their medical appointments.

Visit Your Dentist o n a R egular Basis Dental problems often remain silent creating pain only after significant damage has occurred. Dentists can identify many of these potentially devastating problems before they cause major damage. Additionally, dentists can detect places in y our mouth that you miss when brushing. These areas are prime targets for cavity formation. In areas where cavities are just beginning to form, dentists can use high concentration fluoride treatments to prevent the need for the dental drills and fillings. With proper oral hygiene and attention to what we eat and when we eat, cavities can be virtually eliminated. A Little Flossing Just Might Save Your Teeth O.K. so you've heard that you need to floss at least once a day. But has anyone ever told you why ? You see it all has t o do with bacteria again. B acteria hides between teeth and can create cavity causing acid. Worst yet - if allowed to remain for a long time, these bacteria invade and destroy gum tissue as well as the bones and ligaments that suppo rt teeth. Flossing removes these bacteria from between teeth so they can no longer cause problems. 154 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Personal Hygiene Good Hygiene Habits for Teens Brush teeth twice daily. Floss daily. See the dentist every 6 months for best oral hygiene. Shower or ba the daily with soap, and wash hair with shampoo. Wash hands often throughout the day with soap to help stop spreading germs and to keep you healthy. Shave regularly. Brush hair at least daily and get a haircut every 4 -6 weeks. Clip and groom finger/toe nails once a week. Make sure there is no dirt under your nails. Take care of any injuries as they happen and until they are healed. Use personal hygiene products correctly, including: deodorant, feminine hygiene products, facial acne cleansers, etc. Wear c lean clothes and change underclothing daily. You will feel better if you are dressed nicely. Other Healthy Habits for Teens Get adequate sleep . Teens need about 9 hours of sleep per night. Too little sleep may contribute to mood swings, behavioral problems and concentration (Mayo Clinic).

In the U.S. alone there are approximately 20 million new cases each year, half of which occur among youth ages 15-24 years . The statistics are striking. Accordi ng to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): - One in four new STI cases occur in teenagers. - Young people (age 15 -24) have five times the reported rate of chlamydia of the total population, four times the rate of gonorrhea and three times the rate of syphilis. - In 2006, an estimated 5,259 young people aged 13 -24 in the 33 states reporting to CDC were diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, representing about 14% of the persons diagnosed that year. While anyone who is sexually active is at risk for getti ng an STI, women, youth and people of color are more likely to become infected. They can also face more serious medical complications. Getting the facts about STDs/STIs and sexual health is important. Here you can learn more about STIs, get tips for reduci ng your risk, and find ways to talk with healthcare providers and partners. HOW ARE STIS SPREAD? STIs usually are spread through sex - vaginal, oral or anal. STIs can be spread through any type of sex: from a male to a female, a female to a male, a male t o another male or a female to another female. Some STIs can be spread through any contact between the penis, vagina, mouth or anus - even if there is no penetration. For example, genital herpes is transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact, and can b e transmitted even if there is no penetration. Some STIs can be spread in other ways also. For example, HIV and hepatitis B are also spread through sharing needles f or injecting drugs or medicine 160 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) HOW DO I KNOW IF I H AVE AN STI? Some STIs will cause very o bvious symptoms. But many STIs cause no symptoms or only mild symptoms, so you could not know you have an infection. In fact, most people who have an STI have no symptoms. A test from your healthcare provider may be the only sure way to tell if you are inf ected. If you do have symptoms, they may appear right away, or they might not show up for weeks or even months. They might come and go. Even if the symptoms disappear, you may still have an STI. If you've had unprotected sex, have a new partner (or more th an one partner), or for any reason are worried you have been exposed to an STI, talk to your healthcare provider about getting tested be tested. Learn more about testing here. HOW CAN I PROTE CT MYSELF FROM STIS There are lots of ways to reduce your risk of getting a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Of course, the best way to avoid STIs and unwanted pregnancy is not to have sex. For those who do chose to become sexually active, though, there are ways you can help reduce your risk of contracting an STI. Communicate: Talk with your partner(s) about STIs, sexual health, and prevention prior to sexual activity . Open communication encourages trust and respect among partners and helps reduce the risks for STIs. Also, don't be afraid to talk honestly with your healthcare provider about your sexual practices or to ask about STI tests. Get Tested: If you have never had any sexual contact of any kind with another person, there is no risk of STD/STIs . But you or your partner has ever had sex with anyone else, then testing can help you learn whether you may have contacted an STI. You can't rely on symptoms to know whether you have an STI --many STIs can be \"silent,\" causing no noticeable symptoms. Also, some STD/STIs may not be detectable through testing for anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, so talk to your healthcare provider about the right time to get tested. Limit the number of partners you have: If you are going to have sex, have it with just one person and ask about his or her sexual history. The fewer partners you have, the less chance you will get an STI. Protect Yourself: Condoms work really well in stopping most STIs fr om being passed from an infected partner to another when they are used consistently and correctly every time a person has oral, vaginal or anal sex. Consistently and correctly means that a person makes sure they use a condom every time they have oral, vaginal or anal sex and put it on and use it the right way . Learn about vaccines: One important prevention tool against STIs is vaccination. Currently, vaccines are available to protect against infection with HPV, hepatitis A and hepatitis B . Talk to your healthcare provider to see which vaccines might be recommended for you. Avoid alcohol and drug use: Avoiding alcohol and recreational drug use reduces the risk of contracting an STI, having an unwanted pregnancy, or being coerced to have sex. Alcohol and drug use can reduce our ability to make good decisions. It may also make us more likely to be talked into participating in an activity without being able to give our full consent.

Vaping is the inhaling of a vapor created by an electronic cigarette ( e-cigarette) or other vaping devic e. E-cigarettes are battery -powered smoking devices. They have cartridges filled with a liquid that usually contains nicotine, flavorings, and chemicals. The liquid is heated into a vapor, which the person inhales. That's why using e - cigarettes is called \" vaping.\" What Are the Health Effects of Vaping? Vaping hasn't been around long enough for us to know how it affects the body over time. But health experts are reporting serious lung damage in people who vape, including some deaths. Vaping puts nicotine in to the body. Nicotine is highly addictive and can: slow brain development in teens and affect memory, concentration, learning, self -control, attention, and mood increase the risk of other types of addiction later in life E-cigarettes also: irritate the lungs may cause serious lung damage and even death can lead to smoking cigarettes and other forms of tobacco use Some people use e -cigarettes to vape marijuana , THC oil, and other dangerous chemicals. Besides irritating the lungs, these drugs also affect how someone thinks, acts, and feels. How Do E -Cigarettes Work? There are different kinds of e -cigarettes. But many people use the Juul. This e -cigarette looks like a flash drive and can be charged in a laptop's USB port. It makes less smoke than other e -cigarettes, so some teens use them to vape at home and in school. The Ju ul pod's nicotine levels are the same as in a full pack of cigarettes. Do I Have to Vape Every Day to Get Addicted? Even if you don't vape every day, you can still get addicted. How quickly someone gets addicted varies. Some people get addicted even if the y don't vape every day. What About E -cigarettes That Don't Have Nicotine? Most e-cigarettes do have nicotine. Even those that don't do have chemicals in them. These chemicals can irritate and damage the lungs. The long -term effects of e -cigarettes that do n't have nicotine are not known. Why Should I Quit? Wanting to be the best, healthiest version of yourself is an important reason to quit vaping. Others include: Unknown health effects: The long-term health consequences of vaping are not known. Recent stud ies report serious lung damage in people who vape, and even some deaths. Addiction: Addiction in the growing brain may set up pathways for later addiction to other substances. Brain risks: Nicotine affects your brain development. This can make it harder to learn and concentrate. Some of the brain changes are permanent and can affect your mood and ability to control your impulses as an adult. Use of other tobacco products: Studies show that vaping makes it more likely that someone will try other tobacco products, like regular cigarettes, cigars, hookahs, and smokeless tobacco . 164 Comm. 475 (poisons): The vapor made from e -cigarettes is not made of water. The vapor contains harmful chemicals and very fine particles that are inhaled into the lungs and exhaled into the environment. Sports: You want to do your best in sports, and vaping may lead to lung inflammation (irritation). Money: Vaping is expensive! The cost of the cartridges over time starts to add up. Instead, you could spend that money on other things you need or enjoy. To go against tobacco company advertising: Many e-cigarettes are made by the same companies that produce re gular cigarettes. Their marketing targets young people by making fun flavors for e -cigarettes and showing young, healthy people vaping. They're trying to make you into their new, lifetime customer. How Can I Quit? Decide why you want to quit and write it d own or put it in your phone. Look at the reason(s) when you feel the urge to vape. Pick a day to stop vaping. Put it on the calendar and tell supportive friends and family that you're quitting on that day. Get rid of all vaping supplies.

Nicotine addiction leads to very strong cravings for nicotine. It can also lead to: o headaches o feeling tired, cranky, angry, or depressed o trouble concentrating o trouble sleeping o hunger o restlessness The signs of withdrawal are strongest in the first few days after stopping. They get better over the following days and weeks. Get ready for feelings, people, and places that make you want to vape. These are called triggers. If possible, avoid places and people that trigger the urge to vape. If you feel the urge to vape, try these things instead: Chew sug ar-free gum or drink water. Text, call, or hang out with a friend who will support you. Listen to your favorite playlist. Go for a walk or jog. Try yoga or meditation . Take 10 deep breaths. Keep your hands busy with a hobby, like drawing or making jewelry. Go somewhere where smoking/vaping isn't allowed. What Else Can I Do?

Gordon, MD Date reviewed: September 2019 165 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Substance Abuse The social pressures on young people today to try drugs are unrelenting. The choice and the availability of drugs and alcohol continue to grow. Take a strong stand against drug use. Alcohol From http://www.drugfree.org/drug -guide/alcohol/ What are the street names/slang terms? Booze, Brew, Hooch, Juice, Sauce. What is Alcohol? Alcohol is a depressant and contains ethyl alcohol or e thanol. Ethanol is an intoxicating ingredient in beer, wine and liquor, and produced by the fermentation of yeast, sugars and starches. What are its short term effects? When a person drinks alcohol, the alcohol is absorbed by the stomach, enters the blood stream, and goes to all the tissues. The effects of alcohol are dependent on a variety of factors, including a person's size, weight, age and sex, as well as the amount of food and alcohol consumed. The disinhibiting effect of alcohol is one of the main re asons it is used in so many social situations. Other effects of moderate alcohol intake include dizziness and increased sociability ; the immediate effects of a larger amount of alcohol include slurred speech, disturbed sleep, nausea and vomiting. Alcohol, even at low doses, significantly impairs the judgment and coordination required to drive a car safely. Low to moderate doses of alcohol can also increase the incidence of a variety of aggressive acts, including domestic violence and child abuse. Hangovers are another effect after large amounts of alcohol are consumed; a hangover consists of headaches, nausea, thirst, dizziness and fatigue. What are its long -term effects? Prolonged, heavy use of alcohol can lead to addiction (alcoholism). Sudden cessation o f long term, extensive alcohol intake is likely to produce withdrawal symptoms, including severe anxiety, tremors, hallucinations and convulsions. Long-term effects of consuming large quantities of alcohol, especially when combined with poor nutrition, can lead to permanent damage to vital organs such as the brain, heart, pancreas and liver. Drinking too much alcohol can also weaken the immune system and can increase the risks of developing cancers. In addition, mothers who drink alcohol during pregnancy ma y give birth to infants with fetal alcohol syndrome. These infants may suffer from mental retardation and other irreversible physical abnormalities. In addition, research indicates that children of alcoholic parents are at greater risk than other children of becoming alcoholics. 166 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Synthetic Drugs etc. ) From http://www.iowa.gov/odcp/docs/SyntheticDrugsinIowaApril2012.pdf Synthetic Drugs in Iowa: Get the Facts The use of synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic cathino nes is growing in Iowa, putting many teens and young adults at risk.

LEGAL Very clear, explicit laws on drug abuse exist in every nation. Some nations have very hard laws and sentences. You can spend a lifetime in jail, or many years including huge fines that can potentially damage your finances for life. Other things that will follow include: Criminal Record: You will have a criminal record on your file, and will not look good if you have a case with authorities. Career and employment: Many employers will turn you down because you have a criminal record. Employers do not want criminals around. Licenses: Having a criminal record can prevent a person from getting many sorts of licenses; for example, licenses for driving a taxi or running a liquor store. Travel: Many countries require that people traveling there get a visa. These countries can refuse to give a person a visa if they have a criminal record. Social Status: Many individuals and groups of people discriminate against people with criminal records. A criminal record can affect your standing in the community, the attitudes of your co -workers, neighbors and your relationships with your family and friends.

Your actions will therefore affect: Relationships: Your behavior to loved ones will change, you will begin to do and say things that you usually will never do or say. This will damage your relationship with others. Families: Substance abuse affects the emotional, financial, and psychological well -being of the entire family. Teens who use drugs withdraw from their family members and family activities, as well as set bad examples for any younger siblings. Because their judgment and decision -making ability becomes greatly impaired, they may become more hostile toward family members and even steal from them to get money for drugs. Peers: Your peers will stay away from you. No one will like to have bad influence, and they will feel scared around you. You will lose good friends, and only bad friends will stay with you. School: Chances are, you will drop out of school. Why? Your brain is affected, and you are no mor e in control of your school work. You may rebel and get a suspension, You are more likely to commit a crime, and the results... you know it. FINANCES No doubt you shall soon begin to sell your personal belongings, phones, music iPods, personal jewelry that your parents gave you, etc, as you will need more money to buy more drugs. Remember that there is a big drug dealer who is making money out of your situation. They use your money to do more organized crime and we all get to suffer the consequences.

You can look in the local newspaper for meetings, craft shows, or classes. If you are interested in a sport, watch for team meeting announcements or call the city recreation department. Often, people at a craft shop or sports shop may sponsor related activities. In fact, craft shops often have classes to teach you how to do the things that they sell supplies for, so they are a good source of information. If you w ant to join a local club, a service club or sports club, there are usually announcements in the newspaper lifestyle section. Most communities have programs and facilities designed to improve the leisure time opportunities available to residents. That's y ou! You can become involved in many ways, as a participant, as a volunteer or as a spectator. When you first move into a community, it is important to get to know the lay of the land, to learn the community in a way that makes you feel at home and a part of things. One of the most important community resources will be the recreation program run either by the city or the county. Call your community recreation center to find out how you can learn about classes, sports schedules, activities or trips. They may have a publication or list events in the newspaper.

Contents of this section include the items listed in the box below and space to store bills. Savings Account Checking Account & Practice Checkbook How to Build Your Credit Organizing & Paying Bills Budgeting to Live On My Own Debit /Credit Cards Protect Yourself - Insurance Payday Loans Money Management Rent -to-Own C enters Budgeting Apps/Helpful Websites What is Credit, Credit Reports, & Credit Scores Telling Your Money What to Do \"He is rich or poor according to what he is, not according to what he has.\" - Henry Ward Beecher 214 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Money Management What do you think of when people refer to m oney management skills? Is that for someone just getting out of college and typically getting the first professional job with an apartment or house expenses? Is for the family trying to raise children and meet their expenses? Or is for someone almost re ady to retire and planning to live on a reduced income? How do money management skills apply to you as a teenager? In order to plan ahead for the different stages in life, it is important for teens to learn basic information in a variety of life skills especially which will assist you to become as self sufficient as possible. If you have already comp leted the Casey Life Skill assessment -you probably remember there were several questions about money management skills. If you have not taken the assessmen t yet - ask your case manager for assistance. The following is general information to help you get started with learning about money management. Savings Account Savings are an important part of your financial plan. If y ou do not create this safety net, you may not be able to carry out your goals and protect yourself in case of unexpected problems. The amount you save depends on the goals and time line you have allowed yourself. You need funds for your goals and an emer gency fund that can be used immediately when needed. Opening a savings account is really very simple , you will need the following : Your full name Your address and phone number Your driver's license or ID number Date and place of birth Mother's full maiden name Your social security number Beneficiary -person who is to get any existing funds in your account in the event of your death A minimum deposit may be required to get started You just contact a bank and ask: Is a minimum balance required? Is it possible to withdraw funds or transfer funds to another account? What is the cost of transferring funds? Are there any extra fees? Are accounts covered by FDIC insurance? 218 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) It is recommended that you deposit a significant portion of each paycheck into savings every pay period. You will be surprised at how fast money grows when you make regular savings deposits. Make sure you record each transaction you make on your savings account. Savings account statements include deposits, ATM use, withdrawals, transfers, or bank fees. You should come up with the same total as your bank statement if done correctly. Checking Account To open a Checking account contact several banks to compare their service charges and fees before deciding where to open an account. Often b anks will offer free checking to students. You must remember to take identification with you when you open any new account. If you are not 18 years old, you will need to take someone older than 18 with you to the bank that is willing to be responsible fo r your account if you are not. Once you have opened your checking account, you will need to order checks. You may do this through the bank. Some banks offer free checks if you maintain a certain balance in your account. You may want to have your paych ecks automatically deposited into your checking account if your employer offers this benefit. It is a very safe and easy thing to do. Ask your employer for more information on direct deposit. You need to balance your checkbook with the monthly statement you get from your bank. 1. Compare the bank statement's listing of the checks, ATM withdrawals and deposits against your checkbook register. There is a column that you can mark each item off. If the bank shows a transaction that you do not have down, write it in, as you must have forgotten to record it. 2. Write in your monthly bank charges and subtract that from your balance. 3. At this point, the bank statement and your checkbook should be the same. If not, refigure to find the error. Call the bank if you thi nk the statement is wrong. 4.

This could be an e nvelope or a folder or even put them in the folder at the end of this section here in TIP. If you need to return an item to a store this will make it easier. A receipt is needed to get back what you paid for an item. Some stores will not do a return wit hout a receipt that shows what you paid. Some stores only provide in store credit instead of cash. Organizing Your Bills You will eventually become fully responsible for all of your bills including rent, gas, electric, phone, cable, groceries, and all o ther payments associated with living on your own. You will need to keep track of bills as soon as you receive them in the mail. Set aside a separate file or folder where you can place each bill as you receive it. Be sure to pay your bills on time so you are not charged a late fee penalty ! Paying your bills late can also affect your credit score. Below is a chart that shows two examples of how to keep tabs on what you owe and if you have paid it. The next page is blank for you to write in your bills.

This is a type of check that you can purchase individually at convenience stores, grocery stores, post offices, or financial institutions. There is a charge for them that varies from $ 1.00 to $5.00, depending on where you purchase them. They must be filled ou t with your address and to whom it goes, which is similar to a personal check. 225 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Debit & Credit Card s What is the difference between a debit card and a credit card? Debit means \"subtract.\" When you use a debit card, you are immediately subtracting your mon ey from your own bank account. Debit cards allow you to spend only what is in your bank account. Credit is money made available to you by a bank, like a loan. The amount the issuer allows you to use is determined by your credit history, income, debts, an d ability to pay. You may use the credit with the understanding that you will repay the amount, plus interest if you do not pay in full each month. Unlike a credit card, if your debit card is stolen and used fraudulently, the thief robs your checking acco unt. Potentially, all your money can be drained out of your checkin g account, which could result in bounced checks . It could take the bank 10 days or more to investigate and refund your money. ATM/Debit Cards Most bank accounts offer ATM, Debit, or cre dit cards with each account. These cards can be used at ATM machines or most check -out lanes that accept debit or credit cards. ATM and Debit cards have a PIN - Personal Identification Number - that goes with them. Do not write this on the card or give it to anyone. The money will be taken directly from the specified account when using your card. You need to keep track of your balance and be careful to not over draft your account. Protect your debit card. Look around for any suspicious people or circu mstances as you approach your ATM machine. Leave immediately if you are suspicious. Have your ATM card ready before you approach the machine and move away quickly. Do NOT count your money or even expose how much you have until you are away from the machi ne. Do keep your transaction receipt so you can record it in your account and to check against your bank statement. Never give your PIN number to anyone. Make sure no one sees you punch in your PIN number. Position your body so no one can look. If you pu t the wrong PIN number in several times the machine will keep your ATM card. If you lose your card or have questions about your billing, call your bank. In case of theft, contact the bank and the police immediately. Credit cards It is not advisable to ha ve a credit card as a minor. Credit cards can seem like a great thing - you can buy whatever you want now and pay for it later. But what happens when the credit card bill arrives and you don't have the money to pay it? You could end up paying a lot of extra money in finance charges, or worse yet, you could end up damaging your credit history. 226 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Don't think of credit cards as money - think of them as high interest loans. Each time you make a purchase using a credit card, you borrow money to make the purc hase and you agree to pay it back later with interest. Protect Your Credit Record Pay bil ls promptly to avoid late fees. Keep track of your charges. Do not exce ed your Credit Limit. Always avoid Over -limit Fees. Report any change of address prior to movi ng. Consider this! One young person who got into trouble with their credit cards had this to say: \"I see a credit card as being a reserve fund for emergency use only and a tool to build your credit history for real financial purchases (house, car, etc.) . Everyone is supposed to think that way but it's easy to abuse it. So, bottom line if you can't pay for it in cash, then you can't pay your credit card off... so don't buy it.\" Another great quote is: \"We have a rule of thumb for young adults who say th ey need a card for emergencies. If you can eat it, drink it or wear it, then it's not an emergency. \" Another young adult advises: \"On the plus side, having a credit card with a low credit limit ($1,000 or less) can be a great start on your credit history, provided you always pay on time. However, I must caution you that many credit card companies will automatically raise your spending limit once you begin to approach it so that you will continue to spend on their card. Be judicious with your purchases, nev er pay with credit what you could conceivably buy with cash, and try to pay the balance off each month. It teaches terrific financial discipline, you will never be charged interest, and you won't wind up like me.\" Credit Card Payment s If you absolutely m ust use credit, a rule of thumb recommends that the total credit payments you have per month should not exceed 15% to 20% of your income after taxes and housing have been paid. Most importantly, read the fine print on a credit card application. You nee d to know the interest computation method, annual percentage rate, grace period, minimum payment, credit limit, finance charges, and if there are any fees. Some people run up their credit card to the limit, which may be $15,000 or more, then do not know h ow to repay it. If you do not know what these things mean, you are probably not ready for a credit card. There are local agencies that can teach you more about managing credit . 227 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Do you really want to be paying for last night's pizza when you're 40? By Be th Kobliner A school year's worth of pizza and sodas \u2014 at, say, thirty bucks a week \u2014 adds up to around $1000. Put it on your credit card, and what will it take to pay it off? Make just the minimum payments, and you'll be paying for that pizza 20 years fr om now. That's some old pizza. A credit card is a great financial tool. It can be more convenient to use and carry than cash and it offers valuable consumer protections under federal law. At the same time, it's a big responsibility. If you don't use it carefully, you may owe more than you can repay, and create credit problems f or yourself that can be difficult to undo. Many people get in it serious financial difficulties because of overuse of credit cards. Many end up ceremoniously cutting them up! The most important thing to remember is \" Do not buy what you cannot afford! \" 228 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Payday Loans: An Expensive Way a payday loan? https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer -tools/payday -loans/ A payday loan - be called a \"cash advance\" or \"check loan\" - is a short -term loan, generally for $500 or less, that is typically due on your next payday. Payday loans generally have three features: The loans are for small amounts. The loans typically c ome due your next payday. You must give lenders access to your checking account or write a check for the full balance in advance that the lender has an option of depositing when the loan comes due. Other loan features can vary. For example, payday loans ar e often structured to be paid off in one lump -sum payment, but interest -only payments - \"renewals \" or \"rollovers\" - are not unusual. In some cases, payday loans may be structured so that they are repayable in installments over a longer period of time. Some ways that lenders might give you the loan funds include: providing cash or a check, loading the funds onto a prepaid debit card, o r electronically depositing the money into your checking account. The cost of the loan (finance charge) may range from $10 to $30 for every $100 borrowed. A typical two -week payday loan with a $15 per $100 fee equates to an annual percentage rate (APR) of almost 400%. By comparison, APRs on credit cards can range from about 12 percent to 30 percent. 229 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Rent -to-Own Centers Beware of the real costs when it comes to Rent -to-Own Centers. It may seem like a good deal at the time, and you get the instant gratificatio n of having the item you are purchasing right away. However, a lot can happen in the time that it takes to pay it off, and in the end you will pay way more than what the item costs . There ca n also be hidden fees or other terms in the contract. Do your r esearch before purchasing and check out the following articles: http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/money/shopping/rentacenter/overview/index.htm http://www.moneycrashers.com/rent -to-own-stores -furniture -appliances -computers/ (Partial article below) Beware of the Real Cost of Rent -to-Own Stores for Furniture, Appli ances & Electronics By Matt Breed A few weeks ago, I sat in the parking lot at a local plaza watching people file in and out of one of those rent -to-own stores. Without naming names, let's just say that this particular store is a big one with locati ons throughout the country. I was astounded by how much business this place was getting. It's no secret that buyers end up paying far more than the sticker price at these stores. But are patrons even aware of this, and do they even care? What is it that ke eps rent -to-own stores in business? What Is a Rent -to-Own Store? In a rent -to-own transaction, customers rent an item - typically a major household appliance or piece of furniture - for a monthly cost that's usually much lower than a monthly loan payment would be. The rate is attractive because it seems more affordable than an up -front purchase or typical payment plan. After completing payment in full over the term of the rental, the customer owns the item. But that rental period is a much longer one, and after calculating the total expense, the buyer ends up paying far more than a conventional loan would have demanded. Are Rent -to-Own Stores a Scam? Depending on who you ask, a rent -to-own store could be a good place to get some furniture or electronics as a short -term purchase. Or it could be one of the biggest scams around. The most telling aspect of the way these stores do business is the pricing. In most of these establishments, prices are not marked. This usually makes shopping rather difficult. Fortun ately , there are usually well -trained associates ready to help you find out prices and lease terms. (Please note the sarcasm.) \"Scam\" is a pretty harsh term, but depending on how you define the word, you may just feel that it applies here. 230 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Reason 1: These stores frequently come under fire with entities such as the Better Business Bureau and other consumer protection organizations for allegedly using deceptive sales practices, or failure to disclose interest rates. Advocacy groups that have attacked rent -to-own business have successfully won legal battles to change laws in Minnesota, New Jersey, and Wisconsin. Reason 2: These stores are often less than forthcoming with their prices, but they are legally required to do so. In other words, if you ask, they have to tell you. Reason 3: Interest rates of 100% and higher are often in effect when choosing the rent -to-own option. Legally speaking, there is nothing wrong with this, as the rent -to-own option is technically not a loan, but a \"lease,\" and the product can usually be returned at any time during the lease period. (Fees usually apply.) In a stroke of luck, while writing this, I got a flier in the mail from the same store that I was recently watching. This particular company doesn't seem to have a problem discl osing their \"buy now\" price, along with the rent -to-own price. I guess they figure that either their customers do not care about grossly overpaying for their products, or they are not smart enough to do the math and realize how much they will actually pay. We smart shoppers (yes, you are included in that \"we\"), are smart enough. Would you like to see some of these advertised \"deals\"? 40 LCD TV Buy it Now Price: $1,199.99 Rent -to-Own Price: $1,919.76 Interest Rate: Found for Same Product (n ew): $499.00 Xbox 360 Halo Bundle Buy it Rent -to-Own Price: $839.88 Interest Found for Same Product (new): $399.00 How to Save Yourself From Paying Too Much If you decide (for whatever reason) that rent to own is for you, do yourself a favor and crunch the numbers before you agree to any terms. Far too many consumers do not fully understand the financial commitment that they'll be on the hook for, and it's too easy to end up holding the bag. I would hate to see any one paying $800 for a $250 plasma or LCD television set, especially when I think about how long of a commitment a two -year lease really is. For all you know, your leased item could be obsolete by the time you pay it off! If the deal seems on the up and up, look for language in the lease that leaves you liable for things such as damage, theft from home burglary , returns, or any other variable that could come up. The lease is likely costing you plenty, so make sure to read the fine print so fees don't sneak u p on you as well. (photo credit: Shutterstock ) 231 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) What is Credit? Credit has become an established way of doing business today. It can help you reach your goals or can keep you from reaching them. Credit ratings can also impact your ability to get a job , as many employers will do a credit check before hiring you. Since credit is based on future earnings, it should be used with great care. You can't predict the future. Credit is tempting and dangerous... especially when you have little money to do all of the things that you want to do. Credit seems simple but it isn't. Credit is the trust that a person will pay later for goods or services received now. For the newly independent adult, credit should be used only for necessary items. To receive credit, you will have to complete an application. If you don't have a credit history, you may need to have a co-signer. The co -signer is responsible for the debt if you cannot pay. There are advantages to credit. With the use of credit, you establish a credit history. There are also disadvantages to credit. You tie up future income -money you may not have. If you lose your job, how will you pay for the bills to the credit company? The ease of getting credit might lead to overspending and result in non -paymen t of bills, a poor credit rating, and repossession of your items. Credit always costs money, either as finance charges or in higher prices for merchandise, so you actually pay more for the item. Establish credit so you have it when you need it. There wi ll be times that you really benefit from borrowing, especially when buying large items such as a car or house. You can establish credit by: Creating a steady work history on a job. Always paying your bills promptly. Never bouncing a check. Starting a savi ngs account and a checking account. Applying for credit at institutions such as department stores, banks, or credit unions. Buying something or taking out a loan, then repaying promptly or ahead of time. Getting your name on a prompt paying relative's acco unt. Repaying a student loan ahead of time with a few extra payments. Credit Report & Credit Scores If you are denied credit, find out why. If it's because of information supplied by a credit bureau, find the problem. A credit report can be requested fo r free, within 30 days of receiving a denial letter. The State of Iowa is responsible for running your annual credit report, if you are in a court - ordered out -of-home placement after age 14. If you have anything that is fraudulently on your credit report, your JCO/DHS worker will assist in getting your credit report corrected. 232 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Your Credit Report Rights and Responsibilities The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of informa tion in your credit report file. You have a right to one free credit report every 12 months upon request from each of the 3 nationwide credit reporting agencies (CRAs), which are: TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian - each can easily be found if you search the Internet. Be aware of impos ters who try to charge for this service. A CRA may provide information about you only to people with a valid need - usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business, per the FCRA. You must give consent f or credit reports to be provided to employers or a potential employer. How do I cl ear my inaccurate credit report? If you dis cover that your credit report is inaccurate or incomplete or you believe you have been a victim of identi ty theft, the following are steps you can take to correct your credit history. Keep a written record with the details of your efforts and copies of all correspon dence. Conta ct the credit reporting co mpanies Conta ct the three nationwide credit reporting agencies (CRA s), TransUn ion, Equifax, and Experian , with all relevant information you have to support your claim. Each agency must investigate your claims. CRAs must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information for free, usually within 30 days. The CRA s will notify you within 5 business days once their investigation is completed; you will also receive a revised credit report if your claims are found to be correct. What if you have been a victim of identity theft? 1. File a police report It is important to consid er filing a police report, b ecause you may need it to resolve oth er instan ces of identi ty theft. 2. Place a fraud alert on your credit report If a credit report was created as a result of identity theft, besides contacting the 3 CRAs with all relevant information, consider placing an initial fraud alert (which lasts for 90 days) or an extended fraud alert (lasts for 7 years) on your report. A fraud alert requires pot ential creditors to verify a person's identi ty before extending credit. Contact any one of the three CRAs to place a fraud alert . The CRA that you call must conta ct the other two CRAs . All three CRAs will place the initial fraud alert on the report th ey have for the child. After you place the ini tial fraud alert, the credit reporting compa ny will explain your rights, including your right to get a free credit report from each credit reporting compa ny. 3. Call ev ery company where an account was fraudulently o pened or misused If you see a fraudulent account in your name, contact the company where the account w as opened. Ask the compa ny to close the fraudulent account and flag the account to show it is a result of identity the ft. Follow up with each busin ess in writing. On ce you have resolved identi ty theft disputes with the compa ny, ask for a letter stating that the compa ny has clos ed the disputed account(s) and has discharged the fraudulent debts.

Money Management So how do you really learn the day to day practice of good money management if you do not have the opportunity to have a regular income or do not pay regular expenses? Read the newspaper and sales ads to get a sense of what groceries, apartments, entertainment, transportation , etc actually costs Ask foster parents or providers to talk about what priorities they have for money management and how they decide priorities Develop and review an ongoing list of wants and needs. Does it change? What steps are needed to achieve priorities on the list? Ask your case manager, provider, or teacher if there are financial management classes at school or the community that are available. The local community college, Iowa Workforce Development office or a consumer credit agency often have financial management classes. Seek ways to earn an income -part time employment, extra chores, allowance, etc. Visit a bank or credit union with a list of questions in advance of setting up an account so you have time to compare the services and requirements to establish an account. Take a tour of your community so you know where banking establishments or ATM's are located, where can money orders be purchased and even the post office so you know where to mail bills. Talk to your case manager , foster parent or provider about your financial concerns. What are your money worries? What do you like to spend money on? What do you like to save money for?

It is the law in Iowa. If your vehicle is ever pulled over, you must show proof of insurance. You need to maintain your car in a safe manner and keep it in good working order. Texting or Drinking Alcohol and driving do NOT mix. Do NOT Text or Drink Alcohol and drive . Also do NOT ride with anyone that has been drinking alcohol or is under the influence of drugs. Some towns that have taxi service offer it for free if you are unable to drive yourself safely. Everyone says... I want to buy a car... Why do I need a car? Is it for shopping, getting to work, for pleasure, or for going to school? How many miles will I drive each day? Will I be having passengers? Do I want a compact, midsize, full size, new, used, a small pickup truck, a standard truck, a SUV -sport utility vehicle, or a van? The type of vehicle you have can affect your cost of insurance. Things to Consider... Car Expenses, Repairs, and Maintenance You will have to renew your auto registration annually at your County Treas urer's Office . The bill will go to the address listed on the registration. If you moved, you may miss it. If you have any unpaid parking tickets, you may not be able to register your car until all of them are paid. Here are additional expenses to consi der when owning a car. These are estimated costs : Every 3,000 miles, you will need to have an oil change on your car. This can cost a round $25-$50. Tires have to be kept in good conditi on and they can cost you $50 -125 each. Your car may need a tune u p. That probably will be $ 150 or more. Once in a while, your brakes will need replaced. That is $ 400 or so. A muffler and new exhaust system could run $200 or more. To have your car towed when it breaks down is $ 35-125 unless you have insurance that c overs it. Many things can go wrong with a car, repairs are very costly! Cars all run on gasoline or diesel and need oil regularly. Gas prices are over $2.00 per gallon on a regular basis and a quart of oil is about $ 4 each. 254 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) You will need to put a few s upplies in your car that could run you around $50. This would include jumper cables and other supplies, such as oil, belt, antifreeze, transmission fluid, spare tire, jack, flashlight, etc. It is good if you know how to change the oil, change a tire, jump -start a car, do minor repairs, check fluid levels, read gauges, check tire pressure, and check the belts/hoses. If you do not know how to do this, it is important to find a trustworthy mechanic. Ask friends and relati ves where they take their cars for repairs. Also discuss with them how much they pay for car maintenance and repairs. How to Change a Flat Tire Pull safely off to the side of the road out of traffic or into a parking lot. Do not drive the car with a flat tire. You could ruin the rim and possibly cause more expensive damage. Put the car in park and put the emergency brake on so the car does not roll. Get the jack, lug wrench, and spare tire out. There may be directions in the glove box or with the t ools. Place the jack under the frame and jack it up a little bit, not off the ground. Loosen all lug nuts. Jack up the car so the tire does not touch. Remove all lug nuts and tire. Place spare tire on and start lug nuts. Lower the car so the tire touches a nd tighten all lug nuts. Remove jack. Put the flat tire, jack, and lug wrench away. Go have the flat tire repaired or replaced. 255 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Budgeting to Purchase a Car How will you pay for your vehicle? You may be ready to buy right away. Or, you may have to save awhile.

(date) 256 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) How to Buy A Used Car Most people look at buying a used car as an unpleasan t experience. It can be difficult to find the vehicle you want as well as negotiate a price. There is always the concern that while you can save a lot of money by buying a used car, you could also be buying someone else's \"lemon\". There are a lot of thi ngs to consider when looking for a car. You have to decide where to buy your vehicle: Will it be a new car dealer, a used car lot, a private party or another location? You must find out what the going price is for the car. You can do this by calling a bank and asking for the \"blue book\" price on the make, model, and year of the car you want to buy. Blue book is online at www.kbb.com . You should have the car inspected by a reputable mechanic. The following four top ics will help you negotiate your way through the buying process. Where to buy used cars and trucks How to negotiate your price when buying a used car or truck Key suggestio ns on how to inspect and evaluate a used vehicl e Information on your rights as a used car buyer Where to Buy Used Cars and Trucks There are lots of places to buy used vehicles : New Car Dealers This is usually the most expensive option . New car dealers make a large portion of their profits from used vehicle sales. And when high sticker prices of new cars depress sales, their determination to wring as much profit as possible out of used cars, vans and trucks is all the stronger. But, on the other hand, new car dealers have large selections. And if you buy a car in which they have expertise, you can take advantage of their service department. This can be important if the dealer gives you any kind of warranty. If you buy a car that th e dealer does not sell as a new car, you may be relying on a service department that does not know your vehicle. Also, dealers are businesses. Unlike a private party who may sell one used car every five years, dealers have to consider their reputation in the community. If they displease too many people, they will lose business. Finally, federal and state laws regulate dealers. While this does not assure your satisfaction, regulations give you and the dealers a set of rules for playing the game. For ex ample, dealers have to ensure that the vehicles they sell meet all basic state and federal requirements. That means the brakes, lights and emissions systems work. Also the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires that all new or used car dealers in the US display the \"Buyers Guide\" sticker on its window. The advantage of this is that it makes the dealer put the main points of the deal (except the price) in writing. In particular, the sticker tells you what the warranties made by the dealer are. If the \" AS IS\" box is checked, that means the dealer offers no warranty. In other words, unless you can prove the dealer absolutely lied to you (like tampering with the odometer or misrepresenting the age of the vehicle) you may have little recourse. Do not conf use this with the stickers some dealers put in the window that describe the vehicle and show equipment and asking price. Those are window dressing used to make the dealer's asking price seem firm and less open to negotiation. 257 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Used Car Lots Like new car dealers, used car dealers (independent dealers not affiliated with a manufacturer) have to ensure the vehicles they sell meet minimum federal and state requirements. They have to use the Buyer's Guide sticker. And they are subject to Iowa laws. Also they do not have the overhead of a new car dealer and generally operate on thinner profit margins. That means you can often get a better deal from an independent dealer. There are two downsides: First, low over head means they usually do not have service or repair facilities or any expertise in a make or model. You are on your own for finding someone to work on the car. Second, the quality of the vehicle may be lower. A lot of hard -driven clunkers end up on these lots. An inspection by an independent mechanic is essential. It is recommended to buy from dealers who have been in your community for two years or more, preferably at the same location. Watch out for fly -by-night operators in this business. If you know a local mechanic whom you trust to work on the car after you buy it, a used car lot can offer you a good deal. Private Party Sales Remember when you buy from a private party, you are not getting any guarantee. In the absence of outright fraud, you have nearly no recourse against a privat e party. It may be safest to buy from someone you know, especially if you know that they had few problems with the car and took care of it properly. However, a drawback of any business deal made between friends is that if there is a problem with the deal then the friendship can be jeopardized. If you don't know the person, take a look at their house and how they dress. If the outside of their house is a mess and they are not clean in their personal habits, it is unlikely that they took proper care of th e vehicle. When you have finally negotiated a price and are picking up your vehicle from a private seller, you will need a written bill of sale. Be sure the vehicle is properly described with its vehicle identification number (VIN). Also, be sure you ha ve a clear title with no legal liens from banks or other parties. You will also have to pay 5% tax on the sale price when you go to register your vehicle. If you paid $1,000.00 for you car, you would owe $50.00 in sales tax . Additional costs may include the cost of the license plate and transferring the Title of the Vehicle. Other sources Rental car companies sell most of their cars back to manufacturers who then sell them at auction or to their own dealers. But the rental fleets are also available dir ectly from the rental companies. Our advice is to approach them as you would a new car dealer. The cars have generally been well cared for and many have low mileage. Many also have warranties that have not expired. 258 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) 259 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Suggestions on How to Evaluate a Used Car You should have any used vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before buying. Before you spend the money on a mechanic, however, here are some things yo u can check out on your own that may help you spot a clunker that isn't worth pursuing. INSPECTION CHECKLIST Test Symptom What it could mean Exterior/Body Rippling or \"orange peel\". Look for rust or mismatched paint. Poor paint job. Previous accident if a late - model car. Expensive body repairs. Transmission Fluid is dark and foul smelling. Automatic does not shift smoothly. Manual clutch engages only at top of range and makes grinding sounds. Transmission may need replacement. Car may not have been we ll maintained. May need major transmission work. It also could mean only a simple band adjustment. Engine Blue smoke. Heavy white smoke from exhaust. Oil leaks under car. Excess oil consumption. Coolant is leaking into engine. Could be a faulty head gaske t. Anything from a simple gasket or seal to a larger problem. Suspension Bounces more than 2 times after pushing down on a corner. Worn struts or shocks. Steering Pulls to one side under braking at higher speed. May need alignment. May have been in an ac cident. Brakes Too much play, feels squishy. Vibrates or shudders when braking at higher speeds. Could need to have brake system work. Rotors may need replacing. After you have performed these tests, you will have a good idea of whether the vehicle is w orth considering. If a number of problems appear, especially problems with the engine or transmission that can be expensive to repair, you probably want to walk away. If it seems to have few or no problems, the next step is to negotiate a price. Use all the tools that are at your disposal. Finally, make sure the deal is subject to a professional inspection. In other words, make sure that if your mechanic or diagnostic service finds a problem, you can either deduct the cost of the repair from the agreed price or, if the seller is a dealer, have the problem fixed at no cost to you. 260 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Mechanic's Inspection If you have a mechanic you trust, he/she is probably the best choice for inspecting the vehicle. The mechanic should not be affiliated with the deal er or seller because you want to be sure of independence. If you do not have a mechanic, you can contact the American Automobile Association AAA who can recommend a mechanic. Be sure to get a written estimate of repair costs from the mechanic or diagnost ic center. Then go back to the dealer or seller and use it to get a lower price or a free repair. *Just because a car passes an inspection, remember that used cars still may frequently need repairs How to Negotiate a Price when Buying a Used Car A good place to start is the annual auto issue of Consumer Reports, available in most libraries. Check their frequency -of-repair data to determine how reliable a car has been. Remember that even if a vehicle has good overall reliability you can still get stuck with a problem car. You need to have any used vehicle inspected before you buy. Next, consult a value or \"blue\" book to determine what to pay or what to sell your car for. When pricing a car, be prepared to negotiate with the seller. Dealers are masters at the game of negotiating. Your best weapon is preparation. Financing a Used Car Just as with new cars, you can finance the purchase of a used car. There are some differences to be aware of. First, you should shop around for the best deal from banks , credit unions or other finance companies as well as the dealer. Compare interest rates and terms. In general, interest rates for used cars are higher than for new cars. Avoid high -interest rate \"tote the note\" used car lots that deal with buyers with bad credit. In addition to high interest rates, these operators frequently charge much more than the car is worth. Also, you need to be 18 in order to sign a contract for a car loan. If You Feel You Have Been Misled The state consumer information and protection agencies can help you to file complaints against dealers if you feel you have been improperly treated. You can also ask for general information on your rights in the event that you want to get your money back. Your c ase is strongest if you can show written proof of misrepresentation by the dealer. Without written proof it may be difficult, although not impossible, to make your case. The state consumer protection agencies are best in handling problems with dealers. If your problem is with a private party they may not be able to help. If you purchased from a private party, you may wish to consider legal action. You can go to www.lemonlawamerica.com to get information o n defective motor vehicles. 261 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Title and Registration In virtually all states, you need to acquire an unencumbered, free and clear title to the vehicle. The car must be registered with the state. You will either need to go to the county administration office or to the Court house. In Iowa, you will need proof of insurance with you while driving. Check the state consumer information and protection agencies listing in the site for the telephone numbers of offices you can call for information regarding your state's rules. Your insurance agent is probably a good source of this information as well. Car Insurance If you have a car, you must purchase car insurance. The rules for insuring a used car are the same as for a new vehicle. If you have any ques tions on your state's laws, you can get the number of your state's insurance commissioner. If the vehicle is older and does not have much value, you may want to ask your insurance agent about purchasing liability insurance in order to save money on your i nsurance bills. In Iowa, you must carry proof of insurance with your vehicle. The cost of car insurance can vary greatly. Be sure to call and compare several companies' quotes before choosing a company. A quote is the price with a description of the co verage a company will offer you. These are some areas insurance companies look at: AGE - Young men, especially those under 25, are more likely, according to statistics, to be involved in wrecks, and therefore, tend to pay more for auto insurance. CAR MO DEL - A sports car or a foreign car cost more to insure. YEAR OF CAR - It costs more to replace a new car than an older model, so insurers charge more for the insurance. NON -SMOKERS - If you don't smoke your rates will tend to be less. STUDENTS WITH A B GRADE AVERAGE OR BETTER - Insurance companies tend to reduce the cost of auto insurance if you are a good student. If you have a \"B\" average or above, ask for the \"good student\" rate. COMPLETING DRIVERS' EDUCATION - If you have completed driver's educat ion classes you will get a reduction in your insurance costs. AVOID CAR ACCIDENTS - When you get into an accident usually your car insurance costs increases. 262 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Taking Care of a Car Keep tires inflated to pressure suggested in manual; check when tires ar e cool .

The reason for that is simple: teenagers have less driving experience, so it is easier for them to get caught by simple mistakes that adults have already learned to avoid. Here are some driving tips that you can follow to help avoid unnecessary accidents. 1. Check for cars twice be fore pulling into an intersection at a stop sign. 2. Look behind you before backing out of a parking place. 3. Watch for cars rushing through intersections at the end of a red light. 4. Look both left and right when making a right -hand turn. 5. Watch for cars that are pulling trailers. If you are at an intersection watching for oncoming cars so that you can either cross traffic or make a turn, make sure you check to see if the oncoming car is pulling a trailer. Accidents have occurred when people attempt to cross or make a turn after a car passes failing to notice they are pulling a low trailer. 6. When switching lanes on a highway, always turn your head and physically check for a clear lane; don't just rely on your rear -view mirror. There is a blind spot in your mirrors, and a car may be driving in that blind spot. If you don't physically turn your head, you will never see the car when you switch lanes. Be very careful when yo u are close to semi - trucks, which have bigger blind spots. It is not a good idea to pass a semi on the right hand side, as it is very likely that the driver cannot see you. A rule of thumb is if you cannot see the semi -truck's mirrors, the truck driver c annot see you. Even if you can see the mirrors he still may not see you. Unfortunately, if the truck driver makes a mistake, you are the one who will likely get hurt, even if you have the right -of-way. 7. When driving in town, watch for kids. If you are in a neighborhood with cars parked along the street, watch carefully for kids, dogs, cats, etc. They have a bad habit of popping out from between cars suddenly. 8. Pay attention to motorcycles. They are not as easy to see due to their size. 9. Always maintain a safe distance between you and the cars ahead of you on the road. No matter how good of a driver you may be, it still takes a certain amount of time to stop your vehicle. 10. Don't text while driving. Never drink alcohol and drive! Never get into a vehicle wh en the driver has been drinking alcohol or using drugs. 11. Watch for deer, as they can run out in front of you very quickly. You can honk your horn if you see they are looking to cross the road in front of you. Generally they turn and run away from the nois e. 12. Don't put on make -up, talk on a cellular phone, eat or read a map or newspaper while driving. All of these things can distract you and could cause an accident. 264 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) From www.esurance.com Car Accidents: how to handl e one in 7 easy steps An unexpected car accident can leave you feeling a bit scattered. That's why it's important to brush up on post -accident procedures now, when you're good and levelheaded. This 7 -step guide can help make the moments after an accident less stressful \u2014 and the claims process a whole lot smoother. 1. Move to a safe area (if you can) If it's safe to do so and you aren't seriously injured, move your car out of further harm's way, like to the shoulder of t he road. If moving your car just isn't possible, flip on your hazards to warn other drivers that your vehicle isn't going anywhere any time soon. 2. Stop your vehicle and get out Make sure your car is no longer moving, turn off the engine, shift into park , or set the handbrake if you drive a manual. Take a moment to catch your breath. Check to make sure it's safe to get out of your car before opening the door. If you have flares or similar road safety items, consider using them. 3. Check on others involve d Check on all the other parties involved, including drivers, passengers, and pedestrians, to make sure no one is hurt. Call 911 if anyone may be injured. Even a seemingly minor symptom like dizziness should be checked out by a health care professional. 4. Call the police to the scene Even in minor accidents, a police accident report can prove invaluable when dealing with your car insurance company and other drivers. Cooperate fully, but avoid admitting fault or blaming others while at the scene. Let the p olice objectively judge events and determine who, if anyone, was at fault for the crash. If the police can't make it to the scene (which is more likely if there are no injuries), you can file an accident report through your state's DMV. 5. Gather info Try to write down as much info as possible in the accident aftermath, including: 265 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Driver and passenger names License plate numbers Insurance info Makes and models of all vehicles involved Contact info for any eyewitnesses Location of the accident The name and b adge number of any responding police officers 6. Document the scene If you have a smartphone with a camera, snap some photos of the accident scene. They'll come in handy during the claim process. 7. File your insurance claim If you aren't sure who to cal l, check your insurance ID card for your insurer's contact information. What you can do before the accident If you haven't been in a car accident, after patting yourself on the back (while the car's stopped, of course), use these handy tips to make sure yo u're ready for the unpredictable: Pack a safety kit Keep important documents at the ready (ID, additional insurance company contact information, vehicle registration, health plan info, etc. ) Have your phone on you and charged whenever you hit the road Keep loose items in the center console or glove box, and not on the seats, where they can get lost or fly around in an accident No matter how clean your driving record, you never know when an a ccident can happen. You'll be glad you kept these 4 elements in mind if (and we do mean \"if\") you find yourself handling the aftermath of a crash. 266 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) 10 Easy Ways to Protect Your Car from Bei ng Stolen A professional car thief can break into your car and drive away in less than two minutes. Even amateur joy riders have little difficulty. Although no one is 100% safe from car theft happening to them, there are precautions you can take to redu ce the chances of it happening to you. Here is a list of ten ways to help keep your car safe from thieves. Although some of these may seem elementary, sometimes a simple reminder can protect your car. 1. Don't leave your keys in your car. Too many people leave their keys in the ignition after parking. Even if you are in your own driveway, always remove your keys and shut off the engine and remove keys. 2. Roll up your windows and lock all doors. 3. Think about where you are parking. A best bet, when possible, is a locked or patrolled area. Other smart spots are in busy, well -lit areas or in front of a building. Stay away from dark areas or areas with places where thieves could hide. 4. Keep valuables in your trunk or out of sight. Items such as wallets, purses and stereos left out in the open are most tempting to thieves. What you cannot take with you should be locked in the trunk or glove box. 5. Protect your keys. You should never keep identification on your key ring. When you must give your keys to someone el se, such as a parking attendant or body shop mechanic, only give them the ignition key. 6. Activate the alarm. If your car is equipped with an alarm, make sure you turn it on every time you leave your car, even if you are parked in your driveway. 7. Use anti\u00adth eft devices. There are many devices on the market now that increase the time it takes to steal a car, as well as making it more difficult. Several options are steering wheel locks, hood locks, ignition cutoff switches and stolen vehicle recovery systems/ tracking devices. 8. Leave behind identification. The VIN number, found on a metal plate on the dashboard, should be etched on windows and written under the hood. Dropping your business card into window and door panels or under the floor mats is also a smart idea. This information may help police identify a stolen vehicle or parts at a later date. 9. Discourage towing. By turning the steering wheel sharply to one side and applying the emergency brake, you make it very difficult for thieves to illegally tow you r car away. 10. Do not leave the title and registration in the car; keep it in the safe place. Thieves can use these documents to sell your car. And you will need this information when filling out a police report. 267 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Non-Emergency Medical Transportation (NEMT ) The NEMT services are for members with full Medicaid benefits, who need travel reimbursement or a ride to get to their medical appointments .

Know wher e to go if there is a tornado warning. You should locate your smoke alarms and test that they are in working order. A good rule of thumb is to change the batteries twice a year when the clocks get changed. Find out if you have access to fire extinguishe rs and know how to use them. Know how to lock your doors and windows properly. Do not rent an apartment until a dead bolt lock is installed and all windows can be locked. If you ever smell natural gas -it has a bad odor -get out! Do NOT turn any light sw itches on or off and do NOT use the phone in your apartment, get out and then call the gas company and your landlord. Calling 911 If there is an emergency , like an accident, injury or fire, you may need help from the police, ambulance or fire department . You can call one easy number - 911 - for all of these services. You must know: your name, your address, and your phone number. Speak clearly into the phone. That will help the person on the other end of the line send help to you quickly. It is help ful to tell a few details about the problem. Why are you calling? Who is hurt? Where did it happen? What caused it to happen? If you know some of these details, it will help emergency workers to know what they need to bring. Never call 911 as a joke, to ask for information or to see if it works! If you accidentally dial 911 stay on the line and apologize, otherwise emergency response teams may show up at your door anyway. Often, the emergency operator will keep you on the line until help arrives. T his is because the person wants to make sure that help reaches you. Carbon Monoxide It's well known that carbon monoxide from car exhaust can be dead ly if not properly vented to the outside. But people can also become sick - and die - from breathing the carbon monoxide that may be produced from burning common heating fuels like wood, coal, fuel oil, kerosene, natural gas, and propane. Carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, so it's difficult to detect. If a furnace or ap pliance isn't working properly contact your landlord to get it checked out. Common indicators of carbon monoxide contamination: Chronic headaches, nausea, or eye irritation when in doors An unidentified chronic odor inside the building Dying house plants Condensation on cool, indoor surfaces Get fresh air immediately if you suspect you may have CO poisoning ! *Carbon monoxide detectors are commercially available, and they may provide additional warning about the presence of this \"hidden hazard.\" Check with you landlord to see if a detector is provided . 281 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) To Avoid Indoor Accidents Wipe up spills and broken glass immediately. Put a non -skid rubber mat in the bathtub or shower. Use a st urdy stepladder or a firm chair to reach something high. Do not run on slippery surfaces or up and down stairs. Tape or tack down extension cords and rugs. Store items neatly on high shelves. Keep all electrical appliances away from water. Immediately plac e a lid on a grease fire when cooking. To Avoid Fire and Burns Use a potholder or padded glove when handling hot things. Do NOT throw water on a grease fire. Immediately p ut the lid on a pan that is on fire. Do not smoke or light matches in bed or any closed area. Keep dishtowels, paper towels, potholders, curtains, and other cloth or paper objects away from burners and candles . Have smoke detectors near every bedroom. Check batteries regularly. Change them when you chan ge your clocks twice a year. Keep flammables such as paint and turpentine away from furnace area. Keep curtains, blankets, clothes and rugs away from baseboard electric or gas heaters. Do not put clothes or any type of cloth /fabric/scarf over lamps. Avoid clutter around furnace or on stairways that will block your exit. If your clothes catch on fire, Stop! Drop! and Roll! Keep items that burn easily, such as oily rags, in a closed metal container. Avoid storing items such as oily rags and old papers. Disc ard them after use or store them in safety containers. Plan two escape routes. Plan to meet your roommates somewhere nearby. If you smell smoke or know there is a fire in the building, grab a pillow or wet towel to breathe through. Stay close to the floo r and take short breaths. Outsmart Burglars and Intruders Do not leav e a key under a door mat. You can leave a key with a trusted neighbor or friend for emergencies. If you lose your keys, replace your locks. Always lock your doors and windows. Don't leav e tools and ladders where a thief can use them for entry. Be sure your landlord changes your locks for you before you move in. Participate in a neighborhood watch program if you can. If you come home and suspect you have been robbed, do NOT enter the apart ment! Call the police. 282 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Phone Safety Beware of telephone surveys. Don't give informa tion that can be used by criminal s. Don't give out personal information like your social security number , credit card number or bank ac count numbers over the phone. If you are harassed by phone, report it to the police. Consider using an automated voice mail message rather than a personalized message. Internet Safety 1. Remember - Don't believe everything you read online. 2. Be cautious of people who want too much information from you. There's no rule that says you have to tell them where you live, what your last name is, or anything else personal. Never send a photo of yourself. And trust your instincts. When someone makes you feel uncomfortable, exit. 3. If you're planning on meeting up with somebody you met online, bring a friend along and meet in a neutral setting, such as a restaurant. 4. Try talking to an understanding relative or friend, or call the Iowa Teen Hotline at 1 -800-443- 8336. They are a better, more trustworthy resource than a stranger in a chat room. 5. If you get suspicious e -mails, files, or pictures from someone you don't know and trust, delete them just like any other junk mail. 6. Avoid chat rooms or discu ssion areas that look sketchy or provocative, and don't let people online trick you into thinking of them as real -life friends if you've never met them in person. 7. Change passwords frequently. Don't give your password to anyone onlin e. The safest pass word uses eight or more characters with mixed letters , numbers , and special characters . Online Ordering Stay away from companies that have only a P.O. Box number with no telephone. Do business with only reput able stores or companies. Never transmit credit card numbers, financial institution data, or personal identifiable account numbers unless you are confident of the business and on a secure site. It would be better to use a secure payment method, such as Pay Pal, to pay for things online. You have some security only when the on -line store has set up a secure connection. A business only needs your name, credit card account number, and expiration date. Be sure to know the refund policy. When ordering, print a co py and save it. Check your credit card statement for any unauthorized transactions. If there is an error, contact the credit card company. 283 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) 475 ( 7/20) Reasons why you may want to do a background check on someone you know or have just met.... How to do a free on line background check Modified Report By Kim Komando , Published April 13, 2013 (FoxNews.com / Jeremy A. Kaplan) Have you done an online background check of yourself lately? There are several reasons you should. There might be erroneous information about you floating around the Internet or in your credit report. Maybe you'll find a picture of yourself or a comment you made years ago somewhere that's a little embarrassing. These things will pop up and hurt your chances the next time you apply for a lo an or a job. Fortunately, you can take steps to correct or remove this damaging information. It's also a very good idea to do a background check before taking on a roommate or going out on a date with that new crush you met online. You never know what sor t of worrying or dangerous details could be lurking in someone's past. Because checking people's background is such a pressing need, there are dozens of ways to go about this. Fortunately, several ways won't cost you a thing. For checking on potential room mates or romantic partners, you can use just about any service or (legal) method. If you want to save some money and you have some time, you can do many of the same checks yourself. You might also dig up information on a person's habits or character that a professional might not consider. Click here for four sites that can real ly help you learn about someone: 1. PeekYou gives you more details about people than Facebook and takes less time than Google They comb Google, Facebook and other information websites to find out details that the person has willingly shared. 2. White Pages Neighbors combines the phone book with modern social -networking technology. You can see who your neighbors are and learn more about them in a flash! 3. The Beat. If you've ever poked around on photo -sharing site Instagram, no doubt you've come across some breathtaking images. Now you can learn more about where those photos were taken with The Beat. Be aware that other people can do the same to you with the photos you've voluntarily published on social networking sites. 4. Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website Do you know who all your neighbors are? Did you know that one or more convicted sex offenders could be living in your area? With the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website , simply enter your ZIP code and run a search to see a list of convicted offenders. Click on a name to see a picture of the person an d look at their home and work addresses. A Google search could turn up other things about the person that might make you think twice, too. However, you probably won't see important details about whether they've been arrested or evicted in the past. Luckily , most court information is public record. To find it, go to your state's official government website . Make sure you search every state that the person you're checking has lived in. After that, you might want to drill down to discover any felony and misde meanor convictions on the county and city level. Keep an eye out for civil judgments, too, such as a bankruptcies and court orders to pay debts. In most cases, a credit report can't be pulled without a legitimate business purpose and written permission. A good strategy for screening a roommate would be to ask him or her to volunteer a report. All consumers are entitled to get a free copy of their credit report once a year from the three reporting agencies - Equifax, Experian and Trans Union. The more inform ation you have about a person, the better your searches will be. Knowing a middle name and date of birth will help you weed out people with similar names. If you aren't completely sure you've found the right person, don't act on the information until you'v e verified it is actually them. Being penalized for something that isn't your fault isn't fun.

How 'Sealing' Can Help By Bill Nassif, Erin Planalp, and Brooke Cheseney How do you get a juvenile record? You may have a juvenile record if you were accused of doing something illegal whe n you were under 18 years of age. If the juvenile court finds you engaged in illegal conduct, the court may enter an order saying you committed a delinquent act. In juvenile court, this is not called a conviction, but instead an adjudication. A delinquent act is any violation of state law or local ordinance that would constitute a public offense if committed by an adult. Even if a juvenile court does not enter an order saying you committed a delinquent act, you may still have a juvenile record . How can my juvenile record affect me? Many teenagers think the mistakes they have made as minors will be erased from their records when they turn 18 years-old. Juvenile records, however, are public records and anyone can ask to see them unless a person takes steps to restrict access. Schools and colleges often check to see if a person has a criminal record before allowing admission. Employers, landlords, and lenders will also run criminal background checks. This means that if you have a juvenile record, it may be har d for you to go to college, find a job, get a loan, or even find a place to live. What can I do? You can ask the court to seal your juvenile record. To seal your record, you must file an application with the court. You can generally file this applicatio n if: You are at least 18 years old; At least two years have passed since the last action in your juvenile case; You have had no other convictions of a felony or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor; and There are no charges pending against you that might result in an adjudication or conviction of a serious misdemeanor or more serious offense as an adult. Once a judge orders the record be sealed, a notice is sent to all agencies or persons who have the juvenile record asking that they turn those rec ords into the court. Once this happens, your juvenile record no longer exists as a matter of law. It is important to know that this article only relates to actions committed while under the age of 18 that are within the jurisdiction of Juvenile Court. Any criminal record in District Court, whether committed as an adult or juvenile, cannot be sealed. Does sealing happen automatically? A new law effective on July 1, 2014, helps bring the matter of sealing before the court as soon as possible. The court will now be required to schedule a hearing on sealing the juvenile file two years after the date of the last official action in the case or when the child turns 18, whichever is later. The law also requires open juvenile cases to be reviewed if they have been open over two years with no final outcome. A juvenile case that has no final outcome after two years shall be removed so long as there is no outstanding warrant or detainer in the case. What are some examples of when a case can and cannot be sealed? The following two examples help illustrate the rules on sealing juvenile records: Wynona Wynona just turned 18 and desperately wants to apply at the new Forever 21 store opening downtown. However, Wynona is worried she won't get the job. When she was 15 years old, Wynona was caught shoplifting $100 worth of clothing from another store. No order was ever entered saying she committed a theft, but a delinquency petition was filed in juvenile court and Wynona agreed to probation. Wynona finished her probation an d has only had a few traffic tickets since. 288 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Does Wynona have a record that should be sealed? Yes. A teen has a juvenile record subject to sealing even if she was only taken into custody for a delinquent act or a delinquency petition was filed with the co urt. Wynona can apply to have her records sealed since: (i) it has been two years since Wynona got into trouble for shoplifting, (ii) she has had no felony or aggravated or serious misdemeanor convictions (her traffic tickets don't count since they were on ly simple misdemeanors), and (iii) she is 18 years old. Wynona could ask the court to seal her juvenile record. Note that even if Wynona's juvenile records have been sealed, it is still possible they could become known or discovered. For example, people i n her community may become aware of her actions and could spread by word of mouth or by publicizing information about Wynona on social or other media. In addition, there are a number of commercial entities that mine the Internet and public records for info rmation which they then make available to anyone for a fee. If Wynona's actions and/or record were mined in this way before being sealed or are otherwise made public, a prospective educational institution, landlord, or employer could still find out about t he juvenile record. Romeo When Romeo was 16 years old, he broke into his girlfriend's house late one night. His girlfriend's dad heard the noise and came downstairs with a baseball bat. Not realizing who had broken in, he swung the bat. Luckily, he missed Romeo. Still, he damaged the kitchen cabinets and broke Romeo's cell phone. Upset about his broken phone, Romeo grabbed $50 sitting on the kitchen counter and ran out. Romeo was adjudicated delinquent in juvenile court for breaking and entering with inte nt to commit a theft and criminal mischief. Two years later, Romeo was caught with marijuana and convicted of possession of a controlled substance, a serious misdemeanor. Because he was 18 years old, Romeo went through District Court. He received probati on and a fine, which he has not gotten around to paying. Romeo also has an ongoing court case from forging a high school diploma for a friend. Romeo is now 19 years old and wonders what he can do about his record. Can Romeo seal his juvenile record? No. Romeo won't be able to seal his juvenile record for three reasons. First, he was convicted of a serious misdemeanor within two years of his adjudication in juvenile court. Second, Romeo has an unpaid court fine. Third, he has a pending court case for forge ry, another serious misdemeanor. Are there any other options for preventing access to my juvenile criminal record? Confidentiality Orders. A judge can issue a confidentiality order if a case was dismissed, the person is no longer subject to juvenile court jurisdiction and making the record confidential is in the best interests of the public. While a Confidentiality Order offers less protection than sealing since the record still exists as a matter of law, it is an alternative if you do not qualify to ha ve it sealed. Expungement. Certain portions of your juvenile criminal record may be expunged under limited circumstances. The court will only expunge the record if: The court did not transfer your case to an adult court, and Between the ages of 18 -21, you were not convicted of a felony, aggravated misdemeanor, or serious misdemeanor. If a juvenile record is expunged, it is no longer available to the public. Conclusion The best way to keep your record clean is to not get in trouble in the first plac e. If you do make a foolish mistake as a minor, you may be able to seal your juvenile record to help avoid the public stigma and limitations on your educational, employment, and financial opportunities. This is a brief summary of the law on sealing juveni le criminal records. There are additional requirements and exceptions that are not covered by this article. If you have questions about sealing your juvenile criminal record, you should talk to an attorney. Iowa Legal Aid provides help to low -income Iowans. Income and asset limits apply.

CAN THE POLICE STOP ME ON THE STREET? Yes. An officer may stop you if there is concern for your safety or welfare or if the officer believes that cr iminal activity is \"afoot.\" WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN STOPPED? If asked, it is recommended to give basic information such as your name, address, and date of birth. If you do not cooperate you risk being arrested and taken to the police station for booking. If an officer suspects you of a crime s/he may detain you during which time you will be charged and/or released. Responding politely to an officer can go a long way to make a police officer feel at ease and treat you with the proper courtesy. The use of obsc enities, uncomplimentary gestures, or physical contact with an officer can turn a harmless situation into one where you could be arrested. If you do not wish to answer the officer's question, politely inform them of this fact and wait to talk with your par ents or attorney. Find out if you are under arrest. You are not required to talk or answer questions. If you are under arrest, you should wait to talk to a lawyer or your parents (see page 5). CAN THE POLICE FRISK ME? A police officer may conduct a brief frisk of a suspect for weapons when the officer has a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed and that there is reasonable suspicion that the suspect may be armed and dangerous. Usually, the officer will have you lean against a wall or car an d pat your body to search for weapons. CAN AN OFFICER SEARCH ME? If an officer can lawfully arrest you, s/he may also search you. An officer can lawfully arrest you if there is probable cause to believe a criminal offense has been or is being committed. \" Probable cause\" means facts and circumstances known to the officer which would warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe a criminal offense has been or is being committed. The officer may also search you if s/he believes you are carrying weapons, t hat evidence will be destroyed if not confiscated promptly, and/or the search is incident to arrest. The area searched must be reasonable and the search must be within a reasonable time before or after your arrest. The officer may also search you if you give him/her permission. WHAT CAN I DO TO MINIMIZE FRICTION BETWEEN MYSELF AND THE OFFICER? Behaviorally, your attitude can make a significant difference. In a pamphlet on \"Rights and Realities\" prepared by the Committee on Criminal Justice and the American Friends Service Committee, these behavioral points were given. Politeness and courtesy can go a long way to make a police officer feel at ease and treat you better than if you are mad at him. The following actions often cause a police officer to become i rritated: 1. Being a smart aleck. Sarcastic comments, verbal insults, and smarting off to an officer may make the officer want to bust you. Do not aggravate what could be a tense situation. 2. Acting like a lawyer. Demanding that an officer read you your r ights before arrest will only irritate the officer. 3. Physical assault. This is the quickest and roughest way to earn yourself a trip to jail. You gain nothing and lose everything. (Remember, physical assault is itself a crime.) Never use obscenities (eve n casually) in your conversation with police. at home . . . WHAT SHOULD I DO IF THE POLICE COME TO MY HOME? Police do not need a warrant if you give them permission (be specific). If you do not agree with the search you should request to see a warrant.

However, they may enter your residence under the following circumstances: (1) if there is a crime in progress, (2) if they are in pursuit of a suspect who is about to escape, or (3) if they are preventing evidence in plain view from being destroyed. If the police do have an arrest warrant, they may enter the home of a person who may be arrested if they have a reason to believe that person is inside. If the police have a search warrant, they have a right to enter your home and search for the objects described in the warrant. A search may be challenged in court proceedings later. The police must also have both a search warrant and an arrest w arrant allowing them to enter a home to arrest a person who does not live there. If the police remove anything from your residence, get a receipt from them for the objects they take. CAN MY LANDLORD OR MANAGER GIVE THE POLICE PERMISSION TO SEARCH MY ROOM S?

Contraband includes any stolen property, illegal drugs, or any other property, which is unlawful to possess. in your car . . . WHEN CAN AN OFFICER STOP MY CAR? A police officer may stop a vehicle if s/he has reasonable and articulable suspicion that an offense is being or has been committed. A random stop of a vehicle and detention of the driver for the purpose of checking a driver's license or vehicle registration without a warrant is no t permitted by law. However, routine vehicle roadblocks are legal as long as they meet the following requirements: 1. The locations, time, and procedure of the roadblock shall be determined by policymaking administrative officers of the law enforcement age ncy. 2. The roadblock location shall be selected for its safety and visibility to oncoming motorists. Adequate notice must be provided to approaching motorists. 3. Uniformed officers and marked official vehicles of the law enforcement agency or agencies in volved to demonstrate the official nature of the roadblock. 4.

If you are pulled over on a traffic charge you could be arrested. It is more likely that you will be given a citation to appear in court in lieu of arrest. You should sign this.

You may request an independent blood test or urine test, for whi ch you will be required to pay. You have the right to remain silent, and you are not required to inform the police officer of anything about your action s prior to the stop. You also have the right to contact an attorney to seek advice after being arrested. You have the right to talk with your parents. IF THE POLICE LAWFULLY STOP ME, CAN THEY SEARCH MY CAR? A police officer cannot search your car unless s /he has a warrant or has probable cause to believe the vehicle contains evidence of a crime (except if they are conducting a systematic roadblock search). An officer may also search if there is reason to believe that there is evidence which may be destroye d or made unavailable and \"exigent circumstances\" exist which prevent timely securing of a search warrant. \"Exigent\" circumstances generally exist if, under the totality of the circumstances, (1) there is an immediate danger of violence and injury to officers or others or (2) there is a risk the suspect will escape or (3) it is probable that evidence of a crime will be removed or destroyed before a warrant could be secured. The mobility of a car creates \"exigent\" circumstances to permit the search of a car if probable cause exists to believe that a crime has been committed (e.g., drunk driving). Police officers may also perform an inventory search if your car is impounded by the police when you are arrested. if you're arrested . . . WHAT HAPPENS TO ME IF I AM ARRESTED?

A Juvenile Court Officer wil l generally be notified unless the arrest is for traffic offenses. The authorities must notify your parents, guardian, or custodian as soon as possible. If you are a juvenile, you will be released to your parents, guardian, or custodian if they promise to make you available for court appearances and there is no need for shelter care or detention. As a general rule, a child who cannot return home, but who is non -violent and is likely to appear at a court hearing, will be placed in shelter care. Children wh o pose a greater risk will be held in detention and under limited circumstances some may even be held in a jail. However, juveniles must be kept separate by both sound and sight from any adult prisoners. important rights . . . WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS IF I AM A RRESTED? You will generally be read your \"Miranda Rights\" at the time you are arrested, unless it is for a Simple Misdemeanor (see pages 37, 38, 40, 41 .) These rights include: 1. The right to remain silent. You are not required to talk to the police office r after arrest. Any incriminatory statements you make could, and probably would, be used against you in court. 2. You have the right to an attorney. This right allows you to have an attorney present at the time of questioning. If you cannot afford to hire an attorney, one will be appointed by the court to represent you. If you ask for an attorney, the officers may not question you until an attorney is present. Both your right to remain silent and your right to an attorney can be voluntarily waived. If you start talking with a police officer, you may stop at any time. If you are 16 years of age or under these rights cannot be waived without the written consent of your parents, guardian, or custodian. If you are over 16 years of age, but under 18 years of a ge, you may waive the right if a good faith effort has been made to notify your parents, guardian or custodian that you have been arrested, the reason for the arrest, the place you are being held, and that they have the right to visit and confer with you.

There is probable cause to believe that the juvenile has committed a delinquent act which if committed by an adult would be a felony, an aggravated assault, an aggravated sexual assault, first or second offense operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (OWI), or public intoxication. 3. There is a substantial probability the juvenile will run away or be otherwise unavailable for a court appearance. 4. The juvenile poses an immediate and serious da nger to others or the property of others. 5. The facility has adequate staff to supervise and monitor the child's activities at all times. 6. The adult jail has been certified as able to confine a child in a manner, which prohibits communication and contac t with detained adults. 7.

If a child is to be detained under sections 321J.2 or 123.46 (OWI or public intoxication) placement in a jail or adult lockup may occur only under the following conditions: 1. An attempt must first be made to notify the parents or guardians and to release the child to the parents' custody. 2. If the parents or guardian cannot be reached or will not take custody of the child an attempt must be made to place th e child in another suitable facility including, but not limited to, the local hospital or shelter care facility. 3. If a child is detained in an adult jail or lockup, the facility must have adequate staff to provide continuous visual supervision of the chi ld. In addition to the above criteria, the Iowa law places geographical restrictions on the use of adult jails as follows: 1. If the juvenile is held in an adult jail which serves a \"metropolitan statistical area\" (MSA), he or she may be held in that facility no longer than 6 hours under any circumstances. The following counties are defined as MSAs: Black Hawk, Bremer, Dallas, Dubuque, Linn, Johnson, Polk, Pottawattamie, Scott, Warren, and Woodbury. 2.

SCHOOL AUTHORITIES SOMETIMES CALL YOU OUT OF CLASS TO TALK TO POLICE, GIVE INFORMATION O N WHAT OTHER STUDENTS ARE DOING, ETC. DO YOU HAVE TO DO THIS? No. As always, you have the right to remain silent and it may be wise to exercise it. Court tests have determined that since parents have given children over to school authorities solely for the purpose of education, they may not use school facilities for conducting police department business and have no right to make students available for such purposes. If you are called out to talk to the police, you may ask to call your parents and/or an atto rney. It is your option to talk to the police, but you do not have to say anything until advised to do so by your attorney. These are your rights. 293 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Laundry If you do not have access to a Laundromat , or friend/relative who has a washer/dryer , consider washi ng your clothes out by hand. The bathtub works great. If you have to wear a uniform for work and are only issued one or two sets, this is a good way to keep them clean and neat. Clothes drying rack s are inexpensive and can be folded to save room when no t in use. Just stand it up in the bathtub so clothes can drip in a safe spot. Laundr omat Hints Buy a laundry tote and put all your supplies in it , such as quarters, laundry detergent, fabric softener, and stain remover. Make it a point to get change whenever you can. Keep it near your laundry tote and you'll never have to scrounge for change on laundry day. A helpful hint is to get a roll of quarters each time you get paid and keep them in a safe place for laundry day. Most Laundromats have signs giv ing customers instructions on how to use the machines. Shop around for a Laundromat that's clean, brightly lit and well maintained. Other plus factors are rolling baskets, hanging racks and worktables. Even bigger selling points are attendants and work ing change machines! Six Steps to Successful Laundering 1. Prepar ing Clothes for Washing Empty pockets, close zippers and Velcro to prevent snagging of fabrics, turn jeans and dark colored clothes inside out to prevent fading. Trea t stains. 2. Sorting Your Laundry Read and follow care labels. Sort by: COLOR Separate loads for whites, light colors, similar bright or medium colors and similar dark colors. SOIL CONTENT Heavily soiled clothes, like work clothes, should be washed separat ely from more lightly soiled clothes. FABRIC TYPE Delicates (laces, lingerie, silk, etc.) are best washed separately from other laundry. Lint -giving fabrics like towels should not be washed with lint -attracting items like corduroy, fleece, or dark socks. 294 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) 3. Pretreating Clothes According to the severity of soils/stains on the garments, you may want to pretreat or presoak your clothes. PRETREAT Use for a few small spots. Apply a pre -treatment spray or a paste of granular detergent and water. PRESOAK Use for d eep-set soils, old stains and extensive staining. Pretreat and the s oak items in a bucket or sink with the hottest water safe for the fabric and color -safe bleach. 4. Select ing Water Temperature Selecting the right water temperature for your wash is importa nt in keeping your clothes looking their best. Here is a basic outline: HOT WATER 120 F and higher Hot water provides the quickest and best cleaning for sturdy white and colorfast items. You'll also need hot water for heavily soiled permanent press fabric s. WARM WATER about 90 F Warm water is best for permanent press and synthetic fabrics such as nylon, acrylics and polyesters. It will reduce wrinkling and help protect the finish of the fabric than hot water. COLD WATER about 60 F Cold water offers maximu m safety for non -colorfast items, saves energy costs and minimizes wrinkling of synthetic fiber fabrics. It should be used at all times for rinsing. 5. Adding Laundry Products Detergent: Choose a product that is right for the job. Powder, generally remove s mud and clay better than liquids and can cost less to use. Heavy -duty liquid detergents generally are better at clea ning many greasy, oily fo od stains. When to add Detergent : Turn the machine on to fill with water . Measure and add your detergent into the r unning water, which promotes suds . Add your clothing. Do not put too many clothes in one wash load. Free movement of the clothes during agitation in washing is needed for best cleaning. Liquid Fabric Softeners: Fabric softeners are designed to work in th e final rinse cycle. Pour the softener into the rinse water. Never pour directly on the fabric or spotting may result. If you use a built -in automatic fabric softener dispenser, pour a capful into your dispenser and add fresh water to keep the dispe nser clean. Dryer Sheets : Dryer sheets are easy to use and are an effective means of controlling static cling as well as softening and freshening laundry. As the load tumbles, the dryer sheet tumbles with the load distributing its static control, soften ing and perfume ingredients. Be sure to remove the lint from the lint screen as excess lint can extend drying times. 6. Drying Your Clothes Check the labels! Some clothes, especially sweaters, keep their shape best by laying on a flat surface to dry. If cl othes are dryer machine safe, m ost dryers have at least two cycles: 1) Regular/Heavy and 2) Permanent Press. Use the Regular/Heavy for heavy and medium weight cotton items and the Permanent Press cycle for synthetic fabrics, knits and permanent press item s. Then choose the drying time. Use a Damp/Less Dry time for items to be ironed, a Normal Dry time for items to be hung in the closet or items with creases or pleats and a Very Dry time for towels, denims and items with thick seams. 295 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Stain Removal Many common stains can be removed by just washing, especially if the stain is fresh. More difficult stains may require extra care and effort, but can often be successfully removed. 1.

Always test the stain remover before using. For testing, apply the recommended amount of product on a hidden piece of fabric. Let stand 2 -5 minutes, then rinse. If the color is affected, don't use the product. 5. When treating a spot, place it face down on paper towels and apply stain remover to the underside of the stain so the stain will be forced off the surface of the fabric. 6.

Sewing A button may come off of your favorite shirt or the drawstring may come out of your sweat pants...how do you fix them? A needle and thread will come in handy to put your button back on. You can pu rchase a sewing kit or just keep a few things on hand in a small box, zip lock bag, or a plastic margarine container. You need the basic colors of thread, white and black, a sewing needle, extra buttons, and safety pins. A safety pin would come in handy to fix your sweat pants string by attaching the pin to the string then feeding it through the hole and through the waistband. If you get a rip in your clothes, be sure to fix it before you wash it or it will probably fray more. 298 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Cleaning Clean as you g o! Not because you \"should\" but because it's the painless way to keep things clean and orderly. This means: Hang up your coat as soon as you get in the door. Rinse dishes after you eat! Then put them in the dishwasher or stack them for handwashing later . Wipe down the bathroom sink quickly after each use. Sort through mail daily, tossing junk mail and placing bills in your bill organizer. Make your bed before you leave in the mo rning. Messes will still be there when you get home...but they'll probably be harder to clean. There are lots of home remedies or cleaning hints and techniques. Here are a few to keep in mind.

Baking soda and water work well on many tough spots in the bathroom and kitchen. If your kitchen counter is stained and you are out of commercial cleaner you can sprinkle the stains with salt, squeeze fresh lemon juice, scrub with a sponge, and rinse with water. Vinegar and newspaper or Ammonia and water both work to clean windows. You can use one multi -purpose cleaner for your floors, toilet, sink, counters, and other surfaces. Be sure to check the type of material each is made out of, so your cleaner won't scratch them. Review the following list of household cleaning and other items and check those that you think you will need for starting housekeeping on your own. Once you get your list, check the prices at a couple of local stores. Add up what it will cost you for all of the supplies you think you will need.

Here are 10 rules of eitquette adapted from www.wisebread.com that they indicate everyone should know: 1. The RSVP RSVP is an acronym of the French phrase, \"Respondez s'il vous plait,\" or \"Respond, if y ou please.\" Often, the events are formal, and you wonder if you can afford to go because you might need to dress up or pay for travel. Another issue with RSVPs is that they are sometimes so far in advance, and it can be difficult to commit to something in the future. However, the person having the gathering really needs to know how many guests will be attending. Details have to be nailed down, like the amount of food to buy, and having enough chairs and tables. Do your host or hostess a favor and let them k now, by the date indicated on the invitation, if you're a \"yes\" or a \"no.\" 2. Place Settings If you ever find yourself in a formal setting, and worry \"which fork do I use?\" Relax, there is an easy way to remember: Work from the outside in. That shorter fo rk is for your salad. Start there. With each new course, just work your way in. When you are done, simply place your utensils side by side at an angle on your plate (fork tines facing up, knife blade facing the center of the plate), which is a signal to th e waiter that you are done. One more bit of table advice: Wait until your hostess is seated before you start eating. When she picks up her fork, so can you. 3. Thank -You Notes The thank -you note is essential in both everyday life as well as in business co rrespondence. If someone has gone through the trouble of buying you a gift, has helped you, or simply done something nice, the very least you can do is to say thank you. If you are stuck about what to say, write it out on another piece of paper first. 4. Handshakes There is actually a correct way to do a handshake . Be firm and give good eye contact. This tip may help you in your job interview! 5. Hygiene Belongs at Home Do not floss, clip nails brush, or brush your hair in a restaurant. Do these outside of the public eye. 6. Punctuality In a job setting, being late to a meeting says, \"My time is more important than yours.\" In social settings, late people cause their friends to miss movies, di nner reservations, oven timers, etc. If you are one of those \"I'm always late\" people, you may wish to examine your reasons for lateness. 7. Introductions If you have a unique name that people may mispronounce easily, introduce yourself first and then shake hands. That will take stress off of the person who cannot remember if you are Martha or Marla. 302 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) 8. Cell Phones If you are in a public line (i.e. post office or grocery store) and everyone around you now knows your business, you are speaking too loud ly. If you are spending time with someone, and you are texting, you are not giving your full attention to the other person, which may seem rude. In a movie theater, cells should be silenced, or turned off, if possible. Even the screen can light up in the dark, which is distracting. Never text and drive --it's dangerous to you and those around you! 9. Deaths When someone dies, their families are in emotional pain. Sometimes you don't know what to do or say. Make an effort to reach out, in one way or another, because it is hurtful to the bereaved if you ignore their loss. Start with reading the obituary in the paper, or from the funeral home, because they may describe the decedent's wishes. For instance, \"In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to X charity\" is very common. Secondly, send a letter, or a card, at the very minimum. If you can attend the funeral or memorial, it will be appreciated by the family. Consider taking food to the family. Sometimes, the bereaved just doesn't feel up to cooking for a while. They may also have visitors, and if you t ake a deli platter or a cake, they will have something to offer folks while they visit. Lastly, don't forget to include these bereaved friends or coworkers weeks or months after their loss. An invitation to go out to eat or go a movie a few months after t he death may be appreciated. 10. Everyday, Common Considerations When shopping, don't leave your cart in the middle of the aisle, so others cannot pass Don't take up more than one space when you park Don't post sensitive issues on Facebook! Chew with your mouth closed. Cover your mouth with the inside of your elbow when you cough or sneeze. 303 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Eating Healthy A growing body of scientifi c evidence points to the fact that your dietary intake and physical activity directly impacts your health. Dietary Guidelines for Americans (https://health.gov/our -work/food -nutrition ) may help you in learning how to lead a lifestyle that will attain and maintain a healthy weight, reduce the risk of chronic disease, and promote overall health. 304 Comm. 475 ( 475 ( 7/20) Place Setting Do you know how to properly se t a table? The place setting above is set correctly. Your drinking glass would go above the knife. Grocery Shopping Compare various grocery store ads. Cut out coupons of products you use. Some stores honor other store's coupons. If you do not get a newspaper, stores usually have their ads inside the door entrance. ALWAYS make a list before you go , and stick with it! If you have planned your menu for the week , check ed your refrigerator and cupboards for the food items you will need for the meals, it is easy to make a grocery list. If you have organized cupboards and keep things in the same place, you can easily tell what you need. Compare prices on different sizes of the same product. Larger is not always less expensive especially if you can't u se the larger amount before it spoils. Often, the store brand items are less expensive and of comparable quality. You can purchase items such as meat in bulk on sale then divide it up into smaller portions when you get home and freeze them. You can use coupons from store ads or apps and look online for coupons/discounts. It is best not to go grocery shopping when you are hungry. Chances are you will buy a lot more than what is on your list. Menu Planning Check store ads and do your menu planning uti lizing food items that are on sale that week and you will save money. If chicken breasts are on sale, get a couple, cook them at the same time, store the left over portion for use in pasta, soup or make a sandwich for your lunch later in the week. You ca n use the plastic containers that margarine or other products come in for resealable storage containers. These can be stored in your refrigerator or freezer. A great time saver is to pack your lunch for the next day before you go to bed. 309 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) There are al so many menu planning apps & websites .

L = liter 314 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Expiration Dates (https://spendsmart.extension.iastate.edu/shop/food -labels/) Use-By, Used Best By, Best Before: These \"use -by\" and \"best\" dates are generally found on shelf -stable products such as ketchup, salad dressings, and peanut butter. The date, which is provided by the manufacturer, tells you how long the product is likely to remain at its absolute best quality when unopened. It is not a s afety date. Examine the product to gauge the quality after the date and discard foods that have developed an off odor, flavor, or appearance. Sell-by: Most sell -by dates are found on perishables like meat, seafood, poultry, and milk. The date is for stores to know how long they can display a particular product. You should buy a product before the sell -by date. But you can still store it at home for some time beyond that date, as long as you follow safe storage procedures. For example, milk that has been con tinuously refrigerated can be consumed for about a week after you bring it home, even if the sell -by date expires during that time. Expires on: The only place you're likely to see this type of data is on baby formula and some baby foods, which are the only food products the federal government regulates with regard to dating. Always use the product before this expiration date has passed. Stamped Dates on Packages: Products like bagged salad greens, bread, and pre -cut vegetables often feature a date stamped o n the package. This date is to help the store determine how long to display the product for sale. It can also help the purchaser know the time limit to purchase or use a product at its best quality. It is not a safety date. Food Safety 1) CLEAN - You sho uld always wash your hands with soap and very warm water before you start doing anything in the kitchen. You should also clean your kitchen counter well. 2) SEPARATE - Do NOT put raw meat on the kitchen counter then place fresh fruits or vegetables in th e same place without sanitizing the area. 3) COOK - Cooking food to the proper internal temperature is one of four key steps to fight bacteria and prevent food borne illness. USDA Recommended Safe Minimum Internal Temperatures Steaks & Roasts - 145 \u00b0F Fish - 145 \u00b0F Pork - 160 \u00b0F Ground Beef - 160 \u00b0F Egg Dishes - 160 \u00b0F Chicken Breasts - 165 \u00b0F Whole Poultry - 165 \u00b0F 4) CHILL - Make sure you place left over food in tightly covered containers and place them in the refri gerator as soon as you are done with your meal. 315 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Basic Cooking Terms Bake: to cook in the oven.

They can be fried, scrambled, poached, hard boiled , or made in omelets. They can be cooked sunny side up (without turning) or flipped and cooked \"over easy\" (quick cooked on the second side) or \"over hard\" (until the yolk is very firm). Scrambled eggs are beaten with a whisk and cooked fairly quickly. Depending on your preference, you may want to add milk or cream to the eggs before cooking. This added liquid (about 1 Tablespoon per egg) helps maintain tenderness . For large curds, resist the t emptation to over stir while scrambling. Wait until the eggs begin to coagulate (set) and then stir with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Remove from heat when the eggs are still slightly wet; they will finish cooking in the time it takes you to turn th em out on the plate and serve. Omelets are basically scrambled eggs that are allowed to set without stirring. The most common type is a rolled omelet (also called a French omelet), which usually is filled with cheese or vegetables before it is rolled ont o a plate. Flat omelets are not folded over, but instead flipped and cooked on both sides. Hard Boiled Eggs: cover eggs with water. Bring water to boil. Allow to sit 15 minutes. Drain water. Place in refrigerator. Omelet Ingredients Directions 2 eggs water, milk or cream (optional) vegetables = mushrooms, onion, green pepper sliced lunch meat or any cooked meat chopped shredded cheddar cheese break eggs into bowl, add liquid if want, whisk heat beaten eggs in 8 -inch omelet pan over medium heat, lightly stirring until they begin to set lift edges of omelet while tilting the pan, cook add extra ingredients such as vegetables, meats or cheeses into the middle of the omelet fold the top third toward the center, tilt pan to slide and roll omelet onto plate 328 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) Potato es Potatoes are good baked, fried, mashed, as pancakes, or as French fries. A baked potato is very easy to make and economical. You can top it with margarine, butter, sour cream, salad dressing, shredded cheese, barbecued meat, or just about anything that sounds good to you. A baked potato takes about 5 minutes in a microwave on high. If you \"bake\" potatoes in the microwave, mak e sure you poke it with a fork a few times so it doesn't explode while cooking. Never use aluminum foil or anything metal in the microwave, as it can spark and start a fire. Emergency Food Supplies Sometimes unforeseen events temporarily affect our food supply (such as losing electricity) . Keeping some special supplies on hand can be helpful along with a hand held can opener . Stored foods for emergencies should: not need refrigeration be edible without cooking if necessary be single serving size so tha t there are no leftovers to store not require a large amount of water for preparation supply appropriate nutrients be rotated so that they stay fresh and edible be stored in an area that is dry, cool and clean Some suggestions of appropriate emergency foo ds are: Canned chili, spaghetti, and other one dish meals Canned soups Ready -to-eat cereals Peanut butter Canned fruits, vegetables, puddings Flavored drink mixes, Kool -Aid or lemonade Hot chocolate mix Dried fruits and nuts Bottled water & juices 329 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) SECTI ON 11 Before You Leave...

A Durable Health Care Power of Attorney is a legal document. It allows you to choose someone to make health care decisions for you if you do not have or do not want a relative or spouse who would otherwise be authorized under State law to make such decisions, if you can't. If you name someone to be your \" health care agent \" when you are healthy, you will make sure that someone you trust can make health care decisions for you if you become too ill or injured to make them yourself . To properly use the form, you must do 3 things: 2. Think carefully about the person you may choose to be your health care agent. Do you have a reliable person in your life that you can trust, and feel they would act in your best interest, if you become unable to make the decisions for yourself? 4. Think about what guidance you want to give your health care agen t in making treatment decisions for you. Then talk about your decisions with that person . 5. Fill out the form, A Power of Attorney for My Health Care, and follow the instructions for signing it in the presence of a notary and 2 witnesses. GENERAL INFORMATI ON REGARDING DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE 1. \"Health care' means any care, treatment, service, or procedure to maintain, diagnose, or treat an individual's physical or mental condition. Health care decisions also include decisions about life -sustaining procedures, which means any medical procedure, treatment, or intervention which utilizes mechanical or artificial means to sustain, restore, or supplement a spontaneous vital function, and when applied to a person in a terminal condition, would serve only to prolong the dying process. Life sustaining procedure does not include administration of medication or performance of any medical procedure deemed necessary to provide comfort care or to alleviate pain. 2. The following individuals shall no t be designated as the attorney in fact to make health care decisions under a durable power of attorney for health care: A. a health care provider attending the principal on the date of execution; B. an employee of such a health care provider unless the i ndividual to be designated is related to the principal by blood, marriage, or adoption within the third degree of consanguinity. 334 Comm. 475 ( 7/20) 3. The power of attorney for health care decisions may be revoked at any time and in any manner by which the princip al declarant is able to communicate the intent to revoke, without regard to mental or physical condition. A revocation is only effective as to the attending health care provider upon its communication to the provider by the principal declarant or by anothe r to whom the principal/declarant has communicated the revocation. 4. It is the responsibility of the principal declarant to provide the attending health care provider with a copy of this document. SUGGESTIONS AFTER FORM IS PROPERLY SIGNED, WITNESSED OR NOTARIZED 1.
