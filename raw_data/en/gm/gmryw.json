I am a strong believer in evidence-based, natural and preventative medicine but am aware that my curriculum will be taught with the conventional style of medicine. I have shadowed several physician assistants that I have seen give prescription after prescription, which might cover up the symptoms temporarily but may also not be addressing the root cause of them. While I realize not all PA's have this frequent prescription approach, I do fear that my curriculum will be teaching this style of practice as well. I should also note that I am however also aware and accepting that in many instances conventional medicine is the necessary route. Therefore, I am not sure if PA is the right choice for me in terms of medical philosophies... are there commonly PA's working in integrative medicine, or practicing holistic evidence-based/preventative medicine? Thanks for any advice. Link to comment Share on other sites More sharing options... "}
