CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 3/18/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEAS E 1 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Infectious dose - how much agent will make a normal individual ill? Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How easily is it spread? Host r ange - how many species does it infect? Can it transfer from species to species? Incubation period - how long after infection do symptoms appear? Are people infectious during this time? What do we know ? The h uman infectious dose of SARS - CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease 19 (COVID -19) is currently unknown via all exposure routes . Animal data are used as surrogates . Rhesus macaques are infected with SARS -CoV-2 via the ocular conjunctival and intratracheal route at a dose of 700,000 PFU (106 TCID 50).51 A total dose of 700,000 plaque - forming units (PFU) of SARS -CoV-2 infect ed cynomolgus macaques via a combination intranasal and intratracheal exposure (106 TCID 50 total dose).109 Macaques did not exhibit clinical symptoms, but shed virus through the nose and throat .109 Nonhuman primate infection may not represent human infection . Initial experiments suggest that SARS - CoV-2 can infect genetically modified mice containing the human ACE2 cell entry receptor. Infection via the intranasal route (dose: 105 TCID 50, appr oximately 70,000 PFU ) causes light infection, however no virus was isolated from infected animals, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers used in the study do not align well with SARS -CoV-2, cast ing doubt on this study.14 The infectious dose for SARS in mice is estimated to be between 67-540 PFU (average 240 PFU , intranasal route ).49-50 Genetically modified mice exposed intranasally to doses of MERS vir us between 100 and 500,000 PFU show signs of infection . Infection with higher doses result in severe syndromes.7, 41, 81, 150Pandemic COVID-1 9 has caused 214,894 infections and 8,732 deaths72 in at least 173 countries and territories (as of 3/18/2020).27, 114, 135 There are 7,769 SARS-CoV-2 cases across 50 US states, with 118 deaths. (as of 3/18/2020)72; there is sustained community transmission of COVID-19 in the US.17 High-quality estimates of human transmissibility (R 0) range from 2.2 to 3.193, 98, 106, 142, 149 Early estimates of the attack rate in China range from 3%-1 0%, mainly in households.137 SARS-CoV-2 is believed to spread through close contact and droplet transmission,31 with fomite transmission73, i.e., germs left close-contact aerosol transmission also plausible.22 SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the upper respiratory tract (e.g., throat), and infectious virus is detectable in throat and lung tissue for at least 8 days.138 Pre-symptomatic151 or asymptomatic12 patients can transmit SARS-CoV-2; between 12%54 and 23% 90 of infections may be caused by asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission. SARS-CoV-2 is present in infected patient saliva,124 lower respiratory sputum,131 and feces. 86 Social distancing and behavioral changes are estimated to have reduced COVID-19 spread by 44% in Hong Kong,47 and a combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., school closures, isolation) are likely required to limit transmission.59 Up to 86% of early COVID-19 cases in China were und iagnosed , and these infections were the source for 79% of documented cases.84Early genomic analysis indicates similarity to SARS ,154 with a suggested bat origin .5,42, 154 Analysis of SARS -CoV-2 genomes suggests that a non -bat intermediate species is responsible for the beginning of the outbreak.108 The identity of the intermediate host remains unknown .85, 87 -88 Positive samples from the South China Seafood Market strongly suggests a wildlife source,33 though it is possible that the virus was circulating in humans before the disease was associated with the seafood market .18, 43, 144, 148 Experiments suggest that SARS -CoV- 2 Spike (S) rece ptor -binding domain binds the human cell receptor (ACE2 ) stronger than SARS ,141 potentially explain ing its high transmissibility ; the same work suggests that differences between SARS -CoV-2 and SARS -CoV Spike proteins may limit the therapeutic ability of SARS antibody treatments.141 Modeling between SARS -CoV-2 Spike and ACE2 proteins suggests that SARS -CoV-2 can bind and infect human, bat, civet, monkey and swine cells.129 There is currently no experimental evidence that SARS -CoV-2 infects domestic animals or livestock , though it is expected that some animal species could be infected.The best current estimate of the COVID -19 incubation period is 5.1 days, with 99% of individuals exhibiting sympto ms within 14 days of exposure.79 Fewer than 2.5% of infected individuals show symptoms sooner than 2 days after exposure.79 The reported range of incubation periods is wide, with high -end estimates of 24,60 11.3,11 and 18 days .83 Individuals can test positive for COVID -19 despite lacking clinical symptoms .12, 35, 60, 120, 151 Individuals can be infectious while asymptomatic ,31, 110, 120, 151 and asymptomatic individuals can have similar amounts of virus in their nose and throat as symptomatic individuals.155 Infectious period is unknown, but possibly up to 10 -14 days 5, 84, 114 On average, there are approximately 454 to 7.583 days between symptom onset in successive cases of a single transmission chain . Most individuals are admitted to the hospital within 8 -14 days of symptom onset.153 Patients are positive for COVID -19 via PCR for 8 -37 days after symptom onset.153 Individuals may test positive via PCR for 5-13 days after symptom recovery and hospital discharge .77 The ability of these individuals to infect others is unknown. According to the WHO, there is no evidence of re -infection with SARS - CoV-2 after recovery.78 Experimentally infected macaques were not capable of being reinfected after their primary infect ion resolved.13REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 3/18/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEAS E 2 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Infectious dose - how much agent will make a normal individual ill?

Environmental stability - how long do es the agent live in the environment? What do we know? The majority of COVID -19 cases are mild (81%, N = 44,000 cases)120 Initial COVID -19 symptoms include fever (87.9% overall , but only 43.8% present with fever initially60), cough (67.7%60), fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, reduction in lymphocyte count .32, 38, 68 Heada che37 and diarrhea are uncommon68, 82 Complications include acute respiratory distress (ARDS observed in 17-29% of hospitalized patients ,40, 67 which leads to death in 4 -15% of cases40, 68, 130), pneumonia ,96 cardiac injury, secondary infection, kidney failure, arrhythmia, sepsis, and shock.60,68,130,153 Approximately 15% of hospitalized patients were classified as severe,60, 120 and approximately 5% of patients were admitted to the ICU.60, 120 Most dea ths are caused by respiratory failure or respiratory failure combined with myocardial (heart) damage.111 The case fatality rate (CFR) depends on como rbidities; cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and respiratory conditions all increase the CFR.120, 153 The CFR increases with age; individuals older than 60 are at higher risk of death ,120, 153 and >60% of confirmed fatalities have been male.120 Children of all ages ar e susceptible to COVID -19,53 though generally present with milder symptoms.39 Severe symptoms in children, however, are possible.89 In the US, 34% of hospitalizations have been individuals less than 44 years old.4 Based on one patient, a productive immune respons e is generated and sustained for at least 7 days.121PCR protocols and primers have been widely shared among internationa l researchers26, 45, 83, 116, 132, 136 though PCR-based diagnostic assays do not differentiate between active and inactive virus. A combination of pharyngeal (throat) RT-PCR and chest tomography are the most effec tive diagnostic criteria (correctly diagnosing 91.9% of infections).104 Single throat swabs alone detect 78.2% of true infections, while duplicate tests identify 86.2% of infections.104 Nasal and pharyngeal swabs may be less effective as specimens than sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid.131 cases; SARS -CoV-2 infection was identified in 2/114 individuals previously cleared by clinical assessment.66 The FDA released an Emergency Use Authorization enabling laboratories to develop and use tests in -house for patien t diagnosis.58 Updated tests from the US CDC are available to states.26, 31 US CDC has expanded patient testing criteria to include symptomatic patients at clinician discretion .16 Several rapid or real -time test kits have been produced by universities and industry, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology ,48 BGI,19 and Cepheid.128 The US C DC is developing serological tests to determine what proportion of the population has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2.74 Machine learning tools are being developed to predict severe and fatal COVI D-19 cases based on CT scans.117 Treatment for COVID-1 9 is primarily supportive care, including mechanical ventilation and antibiotics to prevent secondary infection as appropriate.60 Preliminary reports from two clinical trials in China suggest that favipiravir improves lung function and reduces recovery time in COVID-19 patients.126 Early results suggest tha t tocilizumab may be effective at treating severe COVID-19 cases.145 Press reports of a small clinical trial suggest that chloroquine is effective at reducing symptom duration.1 Combination lopinavir and ritonavir with standard care was no more effective than standard care alone.24 Corticosteroids are commonly given to COVID-19 patients153 at risk of ARDS,146 but their use is not recommended by the US CDC.29 Multiple entities are working to produce a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,8 including NIH/NIAID,63, 80 Moderna Therapeutics 94 and Sanofi with HHS.21 Moderna has begun phase 1 clinical vaccine trials in humans in WA state.107 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has developed potential SARS-CoV-2 antibody therapies.99 The development of a coronavirus fusion inhibitor in the lab suggests efficacy across multiple human coronaviruses.143 Takeda Pharma (Japan) is working to create antibody treatments based on infected patient plasma.62SARS -CoV-2 Data SARS -CoV-2 can persist on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to 3 days (at 21 -23oC, 40% RH), with a half has an aerosol half-life of 2.7 (particles <5 m, tested at 21-23oC and 65% RH).125 Surrogate Coronavirus data : Studies suggest that other coronavirus es can survive on non - porous surfaces up to 9 -10 days (MHV, SARS -CoV)25, 36, and porous surfaces for up to 3 -5 days (SARS -CoV)56 in air conditioned environments (20 -25oC, 40-50% RH) Coronavirus survival tends to be higher at lower temperatu res and lower relative humidity (RH) ,25, 36, 102, 127 thoug h infectious virus can persist on surfaces for several days in typical office or hospital conditions127 SARS can persist with trace infectivity for up to 28 days at refrigerated temperatures (4oC) on surfaces.25 Beta -coronaviruses (e.g., SARS -CoV) may be more stable than alpha - coronaviruses (HCoV -229E).102 No strong evidence for reduction in transmission with seasonal inc rease in temperature and humidity.92 One hour after aerosolization approximately 63% of airborne MERS virus remained viable in a simulated office environment (25oC, 75% RH)100 The aerosol survival of related human coronavirus was relatively high, (half-life of ~67 hours at 20oC and 50% RH), indicating ~20% of infectious virus remained after 6 days.70 Both higher and lower RH reduced HCoV -229E survival ; lower temperatures improved survival.70 REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 3/18/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEAS E 4 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Clinical presentation - what are th e signs and symptoms of an infected person?

SARS -CoV-2 Twice -daily cleaning with sodium dichloroisocya nurate decontaminated surfaces in COVID - 19 patient hospital rooms.95 Alcohol -based hand rubs are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 in liquid.75 EPA has released a list of SARS -CoV-2 disinfectants, but solutions were not tested on live virus.6 Other Coronaviruses Chlorine -based134 and ethanol - based44 solutions recommended . Heat treatment at 56oC is sufficient to kill coronaviruses,102, 152 though effectiveness depends in part on amount of protein in contaminated media102 70% ethanol, 50% isopropanol, sodium hypochlorite [bleach, 200 ppm], UV radiation are effective at inactivating several coronaviruses (MHV and CCV)112 Ethanol -based biocides are effective disinfectants against coronaviruses dried on surfaces, including ethanol containing gels similar to hand sanitizer.69, 139 Surface spray disinfectants such as Mikrobac, Dismozon, and Korsolex are effective at reducing infectiv ity of the closely related SARS -CoV after 30 minutes of contact .101 Coronavirus es may be resistant to thermal inactivation for up to 7 days when stabilized i n stool.122-123 Additionally, coronaviruses are more stable in matrixes such a s respiratory sputum.55 Hydrogen peroxide vapor is expected to be effecti ve at repeated decontamination of N95 respirators based on other pathogens.105 PPE effectiveness for SARS -CoV-2 is currently unknown; SARS is used as a surrogate . Heal thcare worker illnesses (over 1,000120) demonstrates human -to- human transmission despite isolation, PPE, and i nfection control.113 US CDC does not recommend the use of facemasks for healthy people. Facemasks should be used by people showing symptoms to reduce the risk of others getting infected. The use of facemasks is crucial for health workers and people in close contact with infected patients (at home or in a health care facility).28 \"Healthcare personnel entering the room [of SARS -CoV-2 patients] should use standard precautions, contact precautions, airborne precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield)\"30 WHO indicates heal thcare workers should wear clean, non -sterile, long - sleeve as well as gloves.133 Respirators (NIOSH -certified N95, EUFFP2 or equivalent) are recommended for those dealing with possible aerosols134 Additional protection, such as a Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) with a full hood, should be considered for high -risk procedures (i.e., intubation, ventilation)23 SARS -CoV-2 transmission has occurred in hospitals inside130 and outside of China,61 including the US.20 Porous hospital materials, including paper and cotton cloth, maintain infectious SARS -CoV for a shorter time than non -porous material.76 Despite extensive environmental contamination, ai r sampling in patient rooms did not detect SARS -CoV-2.95 Genomic analysis places SARS -CoV-2 into the beta -coronavirus clade, with close relationship to bat viruses . The SARS -CoV-2 virus is distinct from SARS and MERS viruses.52 Genomic analysis suggest that SARS - CoV-2 is a n atural variant, and is therefore unlikely to be human - derived or otherwise created by \"recombination\" with other circulating strains of coronavirus .9, 154 Some genomic evidence indicates a close relationship with pangoli n coronavirus es140; data suggests that pangolins may be a natural host for beta -coronaviruses 87-88. Additional research is needed. Genomic data support at least two plausible origins of SARS -CoV-2: \"(i) natural selection in a non -human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\"9 Either scenario is consistent the observed genetic changes found in all known SARS -CoV-2 isolates. Additionally, \"[...] SARS -CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone,\" reducing the likelihood of laboratory origination,9 and \"[...] genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS -CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, [though] it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin .\"9 There have been n o documented cases of SARS-CoV-2 prior to December 2019 Preliminary genomic analyses , however, sugge st that the first human cases of SARS -CoV-2 emerged between 10/19/2019 - 12/17/2019.10, 18, 103 The m utation rate of SARS -CoV-2 is estim ated to be similar to other RNA viruses (e.g., SARS, Ebola, Zika) , and is currently calculated to be 1.04x10-3 substitutions per site per year (N = 116 genomes).65 Preliminary phylogenetic analysis identified a very close genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and a Bat coronavirus (RaTG13) isolated from Yunnan Province, China; suggesting that SARS -CoV-2 originated from bats.97 Pangolin coronaviruses are closely related to both SARS -CoV-2 and the closely relate d Bat coronavirus (RaTG13); phylogenetic analysis suggested that SARS -CoV-2 is of bat origin, but is closely related to pangolin coronavirus.87-88 The Spike protein of SARS -CoV-2, which mediates entry into host cells and is the major determi nant of host range , is very similar to the Spike protein of SARS -CoV.91 The rest of the genome is more closely related to two separate bat 91 and pangolin88 coronavirus. Analysis of SARS -CoV-2 sequences from Singapore has identified a large nucleotide (382 bp) deletion in ORF -8 that may result in a n attenuated (less virulent) phenotype.118 REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 3/18/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEAS E 6 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Decontamination - what are eff ective methods to kill the agent in the environment?

Incubation period Time between infection and symptom onset Time between infection and onset of symptoms typically establishes guidelines for isolating patients before transmissio n is possible Infectious period Length of time an individual can transmit infection to others Reducing the infectious period is a key meth od of reducing overall transmission; hospitalization, isolation, and quarantine are all effective methods Serial int erval Length of time between symptom onset of successive cases in a transmission chain The serial interval can be used to estimate R 0, and is useful for estimating the rate of outbreak spread Superspreading One individual responsible for an abnormally lar ge number of secondary infections Superspreading can be caused by high variance in the distribution of secondary cases caused by a sing le individual; most individuals infect very few people, while some infect a large number, even with the same average numb er of secondary infections Nosocomial Healthcare - or hospital - associated infections Characteristic of SARS and MERS outbreaks, lead t o refinement of infection control procedures REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 3/18/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEAS E 9 ACE2 Angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 Acts as a receptor for SARS -CoV, allo wing entry into human cells ARDS Acute respiratory distress syndrome Leakage of fluid into the lungs which inhibits respiration and leads to death PPE Personal protective equipment Gowns, masks, gloves, and any other measures used to prevent spread betwe en individuals PCR Polymerase chain reaction PCR (or real -time [RT] or quantitative [Q] PCR) is a method of increasing the amount of genetic material in a sample, which is then used for diagnostic testing to confirm the presence of SARS -CoV-2 REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 3/18/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEAS E 10 Literature Cited: 1.
