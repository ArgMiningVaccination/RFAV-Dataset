Editorial Author Guidelines The International Journal of Critical Steiner Research is an international venue for the publication of original research in German and English language. It welcomes contributions that provide insight into the work and life of Rudolf Steiner, as well as papers on the history and reception of anthroposophy and its various fields of practical application. Research on related fields such as theosophy, esotericism, mysticism, idealistic philosophy etc. is also welcome. Please ensure that you consider the following guidelines when preparing your manuscript. Failure to do so may delay processing your submission. Submission Articles are to be submitted in German or English and with two abstracts in both languages either electronically through this website or directly to one of the two Editors Prof. Dr. Marcelo da Veiga ( [mdv@ibugi.de](mailto:mdv@ibugi.de)) or Prof. Dr. Hartmut Traub ( [dr.traub1@t-online.de](mailto:dr.traub1@t-online.de)). Formats Texts can be submitted as .rtf, .doc or .docx files and should not exceed the length indicated below. Please use as few formatting styles as possible. No tabs, no bold print, no wide spaces or small caps! Accentuations within the text must be in italics, even if the quoted original uses other forms of accentuation. Structure Title page To ensure double-blind peer review, please only list the title and the abstracts on the submitted manuscript file. Author details must be completed online as part of the submission process, or should be submitted separately when submitting via email. Author names should include a forename and a surname, not just initials (this will enhance the 'findability' of your publication). The affiliation should ideally include Institution, Department, and Country. Abstracts Research articles must have the main text prefaced by two abstracts, in German and English, of no more than 250 words summarising the main arguments and conclusions of the article. These must have the heading 'Abstract' and be easily identified from the start of the main text. A list of up to six key words may be placed below the abstract (optional). The abstracts and keywords should also be added to the metadata when making the initial online submission. Main text The body of the submission should be structured in a logical and easy to follow manner. A clear introduction section should be given that allows non-specialists in the subject an understanding of the publication and a background of the issue(s) involved. Methods, results, discussion and conclusion sections may then follow to clearly detail the information and research presented. Up to three level headings may be present and must be clearly identifiable using different font sizes, bold or italics. We suggest using headings 1, 2 and 3 in MS-Word's style section. Acknowledgements (optional) Any acknowledgements must be headed and in a separate paragraph, placed after the main text but before the reference list./p> Funding Information (if applicable) In case the research received a funding grant, this should be acknowledged in the manuscript. References and Bibliography All references cited within the submission must be listed in a bibliography at the end of the main text file. Language & Text Style and Orthography Submissions can be English or German. English authors may chose between American and British style, as long as the text is consistent. German texts should adhere to modern rules of spelling and orthography. Automatic Hyphenation Please deactivate the automatic hyphenation function in your word processing software. Font Use a legible font and accentuate text by using italics only. Do not use bold or underscored fonts. Figures & Tables Figures Figures, including graphs and diagrams, must be professionally and clearly presented. All figures must be cited within the main text, in consecutive order using Arabic numerals (e.g. Figure 1, Figure 2, etc.) and have an accompanying descriptive main title. Figure titles and legends should be placed within the text document, either after the paragraph of their first citation, or as a list after the references. The source of the image should be included, along with any relevant copyright information and a statement of authorisation (if needed). NOTE: All figures must be uploaded separately as supplementary files during the submission process, if possible in colour and at a resolution of at least 300dpi. Each file should not be more than 20MB. Standard formats accepted are: JPG, TIFF, GIF, PNG, EPS. For line drawings, please provide the original vector file (e.g. .ai, or .eps). Tables Tables must be created using a word processor's table function, not tabbed text. Tables should be included in the manuscript. The final layout will place the tables as close to their first citation as possible. All tables must be cited within the main text, and numbered with Arabic numerals in consecutive order (e.g. Table 1, Table 2, etc.) and have an accompanying descriptive title. References Authors must indicate clearly the sources they quote or paraphrase. If copyrighted material is quoted and the length exceeds that of a common citation, permission should be obtained. General instructions Short quotations should be surrounded by reverted double quotation marks: \"...\". Simple quotation marks ('...') should be used for double quotes (quotations within quotations), for a non-literal use of a word, and for specific terms. Avoid using the double quotation marks for anything else but a direct quotation. Quotations longer than 3 or 4 lines should be indented, using a smaller font, without quotation marks. Both references and comments are to be set in footnotes, counted in arabic numerals beginning with 1. No endnotes, please! Endnotes should briefly reference the literature listed in the list of works cited, as indicated below: 1 Zander (2016). 2 Sawicki (2002), 144. Quotations from works of Rudolf Steiner, however, are referenced in parentheses right after the quote, either according to the Gesamtausgabe (GA) or, preferably and where this is possible, according to the Critical Edition (SKA). When quoting from SKA, please adhere to the system of reference used in this edition: Do not refer to the page of the respective volume, but to the acronym and page of the particular book you are quoting. The following quotation, for instance, is from Die Philosophie der Freiheit (PF). It can be found on page 187 of SKA, vol. 2; within PF, however, it is to be found on page 171. It is referenced, therefore, as PF, 171 within the Critical Edition. Please do so as well, including the number of the volume you are quoting from. Steiner quotations from SKA, therefore, look like this: Steiner writes in Die Philosophie der Freiheit: Menschen.\" (SKA 2: PF, 171) Steiner quotations from GA, on the other hand, look like this: Steiner calls such images \"fantastical\" or \"hallucinatory\" (GA 227, 51) in some places.
