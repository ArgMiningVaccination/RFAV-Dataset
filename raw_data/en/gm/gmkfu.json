Ithas nobeginning and was acquired from the Gods lirst by Bharadwaja. lord Dhanwantari revealed the science oflife. The knowledge was imparted todisciples who compiled treatises discussing number of theories about the composition ofliving and non-living matter and the physical, bio-chemical biological, psychological and spiritual components ofman and the vital and motive forces inthe body. Medical subjects like anatomy, physiology, aetiology, pathology, treat- ment, environmental factors and surgery are elaborately discussed in the var'ious works ofancient and medieval period. Use ofdead ani- mals, distended bags, learning surgical practices on vegetables and dissection ofdead bodies are also highlighted. More than 600 drugs ofplarrt, animal and mineral origin are mentioned. Ayurveda aims at positive health with the gratification ofsenses, mind and soul. Die- tetics, daily regimen and seasonal regimen are covered. Emphasis is laid for treatment onthe consideration ofage, sex, race, habits, habi- tat. mental frame. strength and similar other factors meaning that the treatment isto be individualised. Hospitals for men and animals were invogue. Siddha system originated by Agasthya isbased on concepts mostly similar toAyurveda. The difference between Ayurveda and Siddha ismore linguistic than doctrinal with Siddha system having iatrochemistry asitsspeciality. The term indigenous medicine instrict sense can beused only for Ayurveda and Siddha but by convention the term isalso used for Unani system. The Unani system was introduced into India around 10th cent. AD. Yoga system pro- pounded byPatanjali isvery ancient and Hathayoga, ofliving.

Vol. XIV INTRODUCTION From prehistoric times, India has been thehome ofgreat lexicographic works, onpolity and Arabic and Persian works -allprovide inabundant measure, evidence highlighting therole played byscience and technology inshaping thecivilization and culture oftheland. One can perceive through this vast literature glimpses ofachievements invarious fields -astronomy, mathematics. iatroche- mistry, alchemy, inavariety ofother fields. Itwas Descartes who said that \"ifever the human race israised to itshighest practical level intellectually, morally and physically, thescience ofmedicine will perform that service \". Itisbecause medicine iscosmo- istheoldest intheworld. upthejudge- ment ofIndian medicine, one must asuperiority over the Egyptian and Jewish; indeed itmay claim even thefirst rank among those examples ofmedical culture which have not experienced a continuous development.

Others like Naturopathy and Yoga which have become oflate separate systems ofapproach have identity with Ayurveda incertain basic approaches and also incertain areas. Another medical system, which ispractised incertain regions Leh, which isnormally considered similar toTibetan medicine, which again shows certain similari- ties inconcepts and approach toAyurveda. Nowonder inavast country like India many systems ofmedicine can claim tobeindigenous due to their stay and development and also utilisation indifferent parts ofthe country, though byand large Ayurveda and Siddha are truly Indian; systems like Yoga, Naturopathy, and Amchi arecovered bythese due to closer identity and similarity. AYURVEDA Ayurveda, popular and ancient medical system, which iswidely prac- tised, into system isnecessarily bound totake one into realm ofhistory. Itisthrough this one gets insight into thethoughts and forces that moved the human society, their ideals and aspirations, conflicts and challenges, diseases and disorders suffered bythem and the manners and methods adopted. One gets aglimpse ofhow itmarched from magico-religious medicine of Vedic period toempirical and knowledge. The beginnings ofAyurveda areshrouded inthe ofantiquity. ofman inrealms and ofhumanistic arts and science. The great pioneers ofmedical knowledge who are concerned with vital aspects oflife, more particularly with happiness and survival remain unknown and only their heirs, successors, disciples and other torch bearers areremembered asthekey figures ofthewisdom towhich wearetoday 4 Bulletin Ind. Vol. XIV heirs. When one thinks ofthis, itappears how true when Cardinal New- man asked 'Who was the first cultivator ofthecorn? Who first tamed and domesticated theanimals whose strength weuse and whom we make ourfood? Orwho first discovered the medicinal herbs which from the earliest times have been our resource against diseases? Ifitwas mortal man who thus looked through the vegetable and animal worlds, and dis- criminated between the useful and theworthless, hisname medicinal herbs. Probably thediscovery ofallthe virtues ofasingle one ofthem was not thework ofany individual.

Atreya, who was among them taught thescience oflifetohisdisciples who later prepared their individual compendia ofmedicine. The Dhan- wantari emerged during samudra manthana (churning oftheocean) one isinthe jaws ofdeath would become immortal. Setting aside itslegendary origin, one finds that Ayurveda had already attained ahigh degree ofdevelopment even as early asthe period ofAtreya (1500 BC) when knowledge flowing from different specialised fields offundamental and appl ied sciences, was already integrated, generalised and principles enunciated. Itwill be interesting tonote that medical school with Atreya thought and surgical school with Dhanwantari thought have come outasearly asthat time. The genealogy ofman inhisentirety-physical including biochemical, biological including psychological and spiritual components that compose him, the relationship ofthe human body and organism to itsenvironm sntthe!nature ofthevital and motive forces inaliving body and other cognate matters were discussed. Our knowledge ofAyurveda comes from theextent treatises likeCharakasamhita, acomprehensive and monumental work, a massive compendium ofmedical knowledge with many chapters, dealt at length with therapeutic medicine orwhat isalso known asinternal medi- cine though other branches ofAyurveda like anatomy, physiology, aetiology, prognosis, pathology, treatment, influence ofenvironmental factors, medicines and appliances arealso elaborated. Equally volumin- ous work, Susrutasamhita while providing prime place forsurgery also dealt with fundamental postulates, embryology, anatomy, pathology, therapeutics, psychiatry, toxicology and avariety ofother subjects. About 100 kinds scalpels, scissors, probes, trocars, specula, forceps with different shapes etc. were mentioned. The use ofdead animals, distended bags, vegetables forleaminq thedissection and operative techniques isyet another high- light ofthis work. Operative procedures like incision, excision, extraction, probing scraping and anumber ofbandaging techniques arealso described. About 600 drugs ofplant, animal and mineral origin arementioned inChara- kasamhita and about 650 drugs inSusrutasamhita. Msdicinal prescriptions, Indigenous Medicine inIndia-Raghunathan 7 pharmaceutical processes, therapeutic methods including psychiatric approach, surgical processes employing awide of pathologic conditions like diabetes, tuberculosis, malignant condition, leprosy, skin diseases, liver diseases, cardiac diseases, epilepsy, insanity, bites ofanimals and insects, ophthalmic conditions, diseases affecting ear, nose and throat and diseases ofwomen and children have parallels inthe present day approach either inthe underlying principles orapproach methods. OCTOPARTITE DIVISIONS OFAYURVEDA Ayurveda isalso called as Astanga Ayurveda due toitscontaining eight branches ofthe medical knowledge. The eight branches are as hereunder: 1.Kayachikitsa (Internal medicine) 2. Balachikitsa; also Susrutasamhita and works ofVagbhata deal with allthese branches ofmedical sciences. There are other minor works dealing with certain oftheaspects related tothe Ashtanga Ayurveda like Madhavanidana, Sarnqadharasarnhita. Bhavaprakasha etc. BROAD AIMS AND CONCEPTS Ayurveda isprobably the earliest medical science that laid stress on *Itwill beofinterest tonote that there existed amedico-historical-social club by name Charaka Club atNew York between 1898 and 1941 started byagroup offour-Charles L.Dana. Joseph Colliers, Frederick Peterson and Bernard Sachs. The name ofthe club was chosen inhonour of the Hindu Sage Charaka. The seal ofthe club had the face ofCharaka. The club. among others had. famous personalities like Sir William Osler. Harvey Cushing asmembers. The club referred tothe 8 Bulletin Med. Vol. XIV positive health, ablending ofphysical, mental, social, moral and spiritual welfare. The main aim, ifnot the entire theme ofAyurveda, iswell tothe orsorrow indicating measures for healthful living for full span oflife\". This stresses theneed for abalanced living toensure wealth cultural and artistic values (kama) and spiritual freedom (moksha). While emphasising the above aspect, however, the Ayurvedic system does notignore information regarding the disease and itsprevention as well astherapeutic measures. According toAyurveda, functions, associated with the gratification ofthe with pre- dominance ofsattva quality possesses mental equipoise, clarity, purity of thought and ideas, pleasure etc; one with rajas quality isfull ofactivity and energy; and one with lamas quality possesses inabundance inertia, passivity, bewilderment, delusion and ignorance. depict components connected with of man asaunion ofspiritual, mental and physical factors. Ayurveda discusses with meticulous care ondietetics, onsleep and ofadisease and similar subjects. Ayurveda emphasised that the medical treatment shall beoriented not merely todisease but has totake into account, the patient, hisenvironment, the meteorological considerations, age, sex, race, habits, habitat, diet, appetite, physical conditions, mental frame, physiological constitution, strength and vitality Indigenous Medicine inIndia --Raghunathan and anumber offactors like this. This means that the treatment is tobeindividualised and the physician who meticulously adopts this never errs either inhisdiagnosis ortreatment. Sections onanatomy have dis- cussed about physical fluids arealso mentioned. Chapters onclassification ofdiseases, aetiopathogenesis therapeutic principles and measures provide awealth ofknowledge which perhaps today might reappear asdiscoveries with new techniques and technologic advances atourdisposal forinvestigation study. Ayurveda hasanextensive materia medica which includes substances ofanimal, vegetable and Himalayas, ofthe mountains. The drugs grown there aretobe properly culled and collected inappropriate seasons and used. The perusal ofAyurvedic works indicates themeticulous care that has gone into the various prescriptions mentioned under clinical conditions. The texts have described theproperties ofdrugs, potency, metabolic changes pharmaceutical steps/processes-maceration. trituration. tionation. preparation ofemulsions. preparation ofinfusions. preparation of medicated oils, extraction ofoils and juices. preparation ofmedicines by fermentation process-are just afew described. The innumerable remedies mentioned inthe work are sure toprovide rich dividends ifinvestigated and many unfailing remedies may bebrought out for diseases hitherto unconquered. MEDICAL HOSPITALS AND HERB GARDENS The existence ofhospitals for men and animals inIndia asearly as 3rdcentury BC isvery well known. The Mauryan Emperor Asoka after witnessing the horrors ofKalinga war ordered the establishment of hospitals formen and animals aswell throughout the kingdom. The rock edict atGirnar mentions this. The Chinese pilgrim FaHien who visited India during the 5th cen. ADduring the period of Chandragupta records thefree hospital houses fordispensing pervading into the 10 Bulletin Ind. Inst. Hist. Med.

This system was introduced into India bythe muslim rulers round about 10th century A.D.While defining Tibb, Avicenna the Persian physician of10th deals inthehuman body forthe purpose ofadopting suitable forpreserving and restoring health. This isreminiscent oftheview advocated ingreat classics ofUnani. This system has itsown areas ofspecialisation and occupies vantage position intherapeutics ofcertain conditions.

TIBETAN SYSTEM OFMEDICINE traces itsorigin toAyurvedic system dawn ofhistory man has been insearch ofways tofind cure and relief from mental and physical diseases. The ways were inthe form of benediction, witchcraft etc. Itisatthat time Buddha delivered this original Tibstan system ofmedicine while the Lord was meditating inthe medicinal forest, somewhere near Budh Gaya. Itwas later inthereign of Tibetan King Strang-ki-chan (750 one renowned Pandit named Baro- chana was sent toIndia and hetranslated into Tibetan script with the help ofAcharya Chandra Dave. The text was then brought toTibet. This medical system had accumulated ahuge literature inthe course oftime and Amchis ofgreat fame and reputation were produced, whose contribution inthis system isimmense. Therapy under Tibetan system isdivided into treatment byherbs, minerals, animal organs, spring and mineral waters, moxibustion (herbal 1\".\u00b7../..Bulletin Ind. Inst. Hist. Me d. vol.
