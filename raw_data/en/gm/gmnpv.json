The arrival of our ancestors who migrated to Mauritius has greatly influenced the course of history and served as the basis for our present society. We should pay homage to our forefathers for their fortitude and resilience, with which they have faced hardship, humiliation and sufferings, besides leading a wretched and miserable life. It is only through their sacrifice and foresight that the very first generation of children of Indian immigrants was able to get access to education. This has allowed them to emerge as the first elites from their ranks, to challenge the established order and rally support for democracy and liberty. These memories should serve as an inspiration to the younger generation to work harder and make Mauritius a still better place to live. Our heritage, our culture and our language should be preserved as these give us our true identity. Coming generations should know the truth and the difficult stages of life that we have been through before making Mauritius what it is today.I wish the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund plenty of success in its mission to preserve our heritage. 29 September 2010 2010 has been a very fruitful year for the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund and several new projects have been initiated which should start bearing fruit very soon. The Beekrumsing RamlallahInterpretation Centre has had aslow start but has finally takenoff. The only site in the world, inscribed on UNESCO's list that is devoted to indenture, will officially open its InterpretationCentre next November 2011. Conceptualization of such an interpretation centre has been slow and painful, as we reflect on our history, and decide what wethink is important for Mauritians to know, even though some maynot agree or wish to know. Although we live in a world where information is readily available everywhere, we face a public that reads less but wishes to access information in other mediums orhas no time to read lengthy texts. The challenge of presenting historical information in a manner that is attractive has been aformidable one and will no doubt give rise to further intensediscussion. The AGTF faces other challenges, that of not having a legal Buffer Zone, four years after being inscribed on the World Heritage List. Our desire to preserve our cultural heritage faces a credibility challenge, when all over the world, n ew sites are continually being added to national and international heritage lists. As a small island-state, Mauritius' cultural and natural heritage is in greaterdanger, where resources are scarce and competition for spaceintense. Our forests and traditional walking paths in miles of open land are increasingly closed. Mauritians are no longer free to roamthe woods and mountains to look for medicinal plants as our grandmothers and grandfathers did or enjoy clean, fresh air. Our health is as much in question today as it was in the nineteenth century and despite medical advances, many Mauritians prefertraditional methods. This history has been documented for the first time on the first ever book written on the health ofindentured immigrants. Traditional knowledge and healing practices are under threat. For this reason the AGTF has embarked this year on an Intangible Heritage project with the assistance of historians and anthropologists who have with field guides, scoured the island observing and recording all items of our heritage they encounter. We hope to present the results of this work next year in BRIC. Dr Vijayalakshmi Teelock, GOSK Chairperson, Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund 16 the AGWHS21oct:News 23x07.qxd 10/22/2010 8:28 AM Page 23aapRaVaSI ghaT TRuST fuND NEWSLETTER 2 November 2010 Iam pleased to be associated with the publication of this annual newsletter by the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund, to mark the 176thanniversary of of the indentured The Ghat, previously known was an immigrant's depot constructed in 1849, on the shore of Trou Fanfaron Bay in Port Louis harbour, in order to receive indentured immigrants who came mainly from India. Between 1849 and 1910, about half a million indentured labourers, from various parts of the Indian subcontinent, transited through the Aapravasi Ghat. In 1987, the depot's name was changed from 'Coolie Ghat' to 'Aapravasi Ghat' when it was decreed a national monument. Furthermore, in 2001, the Governmentdecreed the 2 nd November a public holiday to honour the memory of the indentured labourers. In terms of both cultural as well as natural sites, the UNESCOWorld Heritage List contains relatively few sites in small island developing nations. The inscription of the Aapravasi Ghat onthis list in 2006 is testimony to the highly symbolic nature of the site. My Ministry will continue to support the protection of all forms of heritage: oral, tangible and intangible. Heritage is not only a manif estation of culture but most importantly, it is a means of strengthening a nation through its memory. I will continue to take a keen interest in this unique World Heritage Site and wish the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund plenty ofsuccess in the implementation of its projects. I commend the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund for the issue of its annual newsletter to mark the 176th anniversary of the arrival of the first indentured labourers in Mauritius. The Aapravasi Ghat Site, formerly known as the Immigration Depot, epitomizes an important chapter of our history since the ancestors of the majority of our population arrived on the island through this immigrant depot. The indentured labourers who climbed up the site's famous sixteen steps helped build our country through their toil and endurance in the face of overwhelming adversity. As a mark of respect and affection to them, the 2ndNovember has been decreed a public holiday. Each year, this day is commemorated, at the highest level, at the Aapravasi Ghat. In 2006, the Aapravasi Ghat, classified as a national monument, was inscribed on the prestigious World Heritage List of UNESCO, thus this Mauritian lieu de m\u00e9moire gets the recognition of the whole humanity. Government is determined to preserve our historic sites and we must ensure that the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund adheres to its mission of preserving this World Heritage Site and continues its research work on our heritage. I congratulate the board and employees of the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund for their achievement. pRIME MINISTER'S MESSagE MINISTER'S MESSagE Dr the Hon. Navinchandra Ramgoolam, GCSK, FRCP Prime Minister 12 October 2010MINISTRY OF ARTS AND CULTURE (Office of the Minister) 21oct:News 23x07.qxd 10/22/2010 8:28 AM Page 34aapRaVaSI ghaT TRuST fuND NEWSLETTER 2 November 2010 The Aapravasi Ghat, the first World Heritage Site of Mauritius, is located in Port Louis and willcelebrate this year the 176 thanniversary of the arrival of indentured labourers in Mauritius. We in Port Louis are proud of having been closely associated with all the procedures leading to the inscription of thisnational heritage, vestige of the arrival of the first indentured labourers. This site bears testimony to the hopes, the aspirations of these people who had left their country to settle in Mauritius. The arrival of these labourers had been a historical event which later was to have a social and economic impact, thus changing the course ofhistory. There is no doubt about the fact that it is mankind who makes up history. Those indentured labourers who stepped on the land of Mauritius, at the specific po int where Aapravasi Ghat stands now, would never have imagined the extent of events which were to take place in their country of adoption.The Aapravasi Ghat is now altogether a symbol and a commitment in memory of these Indian immigrants whose contribution to thedevelopment of Mauritius has to be remembered always. The Municipal Council has played a significant role right from the start when the project o f inscription of the site had been launched. As Chairperson of the Buffer Zone Committee, it is my duty and also of those who will be my successors to contribute to efforts of the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund to uphold the symbolism, the dignity of this site.MESSagE LoRD MayoR of poRT LouIS aapravasi ghat World heritage Site and its Buffer Zone Raju Mohit - Officer-in-Charge, Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund Mauritius is blessed with several important historical and cultural heritage sites and structures such as the Aapravasi Ghat WorldHeritage Site, the Le Morne Cultural Landscape and l'Ile de la Passe. Most of these tangible survivors of our country's rich, complex, and unique past which until recentlyhave remained underdeveloped. Altogether they have the potential to make of Mauritius an exceptional heritage tourism capital in the Indian Ocean and the rest of the world. Each one provides a narrative of the past. The different epochs of our history areencapsulated in them. They need to be deciphered and disseminated. They lead us tohistorical insights of considerable depth and breadth. The exceptional thing about history is that events and those who wereinstrumental in their creation, never belong exclusively to a specific period and time. In fact, historians have the skills as well as the dexterity to reinterpret and revive the long forgotten events over the ages. Writers filter the fact and data as per their ideology and requirements of their times and situate them in their perspectives. Mauritius is a country with many faces. Every Mauritian preserves his/her cultural identity in the varied context of our plural society. It is incumbent on the authorities to preserve the recognition of the past of every community which helps to consolidate our nationhood. Every Mauritian should be given the opportunity to identify himself with his/her heritage. This identification develops a sense of belonging to history of the country and ultimately to the Mauritian nation itself. Nation building is a programme which evolves at its own pace and potentials. The molding of a distinct Mauritian identity which started only as far back as 1968 still has a long way to go though it proved its mettle. Mauritianism is a matter of common ownership. The Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site is one of cornerstones of our Mauritianism and of the cultural heritage of Mauritius. It is that unique place in time and space which helped to fashion the history of our country. Between 1849 and 1910, the arrival of more than 400,000 indentured immigrants at the Aapravasi Ghat was a milestone in the evolution of our country's unique history. Their gradual introduction over a period of more than seven decadesforever altered the demography, society, economy and politics of the island. It was by the sweat of their brows, hardwork and unwavering dedication that the indentured labourers transformed this small Indian Ocean island into a garden of sugar and into one of the most important sugar producing European colonies in world during the mid-19 thcentury. It was at the Aapravasi Ghat or 'the landing place of the immigrants' that theindentured labourers spent their first two days in Mauritius which most of them adopted as their new home. These labourers originated from different parts of India, China, South-East Asia, Madagascar and East Africa. The indentured workerswho climbed up the emblematic sixteen of the Aapravasi Ghat were adherents to the Hindu, Muslim, Christian and Buddhist faiths. It is also important to take note that the Buffer Zone of the Aapravasi Ghat is a historical urban landscape that contains a unique collection of remaining and highly significant urban buildings, spaces and elements from the French and subsequent British Colonial era, combined with those of other cultures who were drawn into their ambit. The evolution of the Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site and its Buffer Zone, Continued on Page 5 Sheikh Mukhtar Hossenbocus Lord Mayor 19 October 201021oct:News 23x07.qxd 10/22/2010 8:28 AM Page 45aapRaVaSI ghaT TRuST fuND NEWSLETTER 2 November 2010 situated in the centre of the port city of Mauritius reflects the path followed by the island in its development between the mid-1700s and the mid-1900s. This progression can be seen in the continuity of the land use and thetransition between traditional andmodern architecture. The bustling activity of the area today provides a fine indication of the atmosphere that existed during the Indentured period. Some of the small family owned shops dealing in retail and wholesale businesses date back from the Indentured period. Shopping in thearea for goods such as spices, textileand accessories and hardware items, along with the fresh products from theCentral Market, has been part of thedaily lives of the local Mauritian since the 19 thcentury. Apart from the local population, the area also crowded with shopkeepers from neighbouring rural areas who came to replenish their supplies and trusted employees from the sugar estates who purchased the required provisions for the legally mandatoryweekly rations. Supplies for distributionas rations for indentured labourers on the Immigration Depot also came fromthese shops and markets. Following the expansion of trade and sugar production, the area also expanded over time to accommodate more and more port related activities such as the storing of goods and uploading of ships. The Granary is a fineexample of this era, as are the varioussmaller warehouses situated along Farquhar Street and part of Louis Pasteur Street. In 2007, the AGTF started the preparation of a Planning Policy Guidance for the protection of the Buffer Zone of the Aapravasi Ghat with the collaboration of the Ministry of Arts and Culture, Ministry of Housing and Lands and the Municipal Council of Port Louis. Nine drafts were workedout and were circulated to relevant stakeholders including owners of property, who were consulted on a continuous basis. The comments andrecommendations of the stakeholderswere considered and integrated in thefinal draft of the Planning PolicyGuidance - Aapravasi Ghat. The final draft has been submitted to the Authorities for adoption and promulgation.Message from president of global organization of people of Indian origin (gopIo) International and gopIo Mauritius Mahen utchanah 176 years after the arrival of Indian immigrants in Mauritius, our motherland has become a model where people from differentparts of the world including Africa, Europe, Madagascar, China, India and Mauritius, have settled and are living in peace and harmony and have created a st rong sense of brotherhood. Mauritius has made remarkable strides on the path of development. T oday we are proud of our Indianness and have contributed to create a rainbow nation. The 2 ndof November is a public holiday, in memory of our ancestors who left India and toiled so hard to make this rocky island a paradise on earth. This day also offers an opportunity to remember the illustrious sons and daughters of our soil; like Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, the Sir Abdool Razak Mohamed, and also celebrate the achievements of our political leaders, like the present Prime Minister Hon Navinchandra Ramgoolam and the other young leaders who are contributing to shape our country's future. All of them have contributed to the upliftment of the country and give the People of Indian Origin, the dignity they deserve. The Aapravasi Ghat, the landing place for the Indian immigrants, was recognised as a monumentby the Government way back in 1987. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2006. Besides Mauritius, a good number of other countries, with PIO population, also celebrate the arrival of Indian immigrants in their respective countries. Thus, this year, South Africa is celebrating the 150 years of the arrival of Indian immigrants to that country. GOPIO International together with socio cultural organisations and the South African Government andPresident Zuma personally, are giving full support to celebrate this event. Guyana, the country of late president Cheddi Jagan and of the current president Bharrat Jadgeo celebrate the arrival of Indian immigrants on 5 thof March. The first batch of the immigrants from India reached that country way back in 1858. In Trinidad and T obaggo, the 30thMay is observed at the arrival date of Indian immigrants. Their forefathers first laid their feet on that land in 1845. Former PM Basdeo Panday and current PM Kamla Persad Bissesur also celebrate this event. In the same context, in Surinam, 5thJune 1873 is also a day of celebration. It's political leaders and former Vice President Sard Joe, Former Vice President Jules Ajodhia and current vice president Robert Ammeradi attach great importance to the 5ndJune. In the islands of Fiji, the first Indian immigrants arrived there in March 1837. Mahendra Chaudhury was the first PIO to serve as Prime Minister of that country, unfortunately, his tenure as Prime Minister was short and he was ousted by a coup d'etat. The PIO's in Fiji have known some hard times and many are still experiencing difficulties. A large number of Fijian PIO's have migrated to Australia, New Zealand and other countries. Reunion Island, Guadeloupe and Martinique also have a good number of PIO and their forefathers left the shores of India some 250 years ago. From the French speaking PIO's, we may mention illustrious figures like Senator Jean Paul Virrapoulley, Jean Francois Sita, Serge Lechimee and Ernest Mootoosamy. They have cut a figure for themselves and also contributed to the development of their respective countries of adoption. They show great pride in the motherland of their ancestors and they are proud of their Indianness. We are doing everything possible to bring the French Speaking PIO's in the PIO Mainstream and integrate them in the large PIO family.In the name of GOPIO International and GOPIO Mauritius, I wish the PIO community worldwide plenty of success and my message to them is that they should be good patriots in their respective countries of adoption and contribute to keep the PIO flag high. 21oct:News 23x07.qxd 10/22/2010 8:28 AM Page 56AApRA v ASi GhAT TRuST FuNd NEWSLETTER 2 November 2010 hon.

Living in India, a country with a rich civilization and different cultures has further strengthened this interest. fINDINg hIS RooTS \"Finding our roots is a must,\" as the Hon. Minister stated in an interview. Like other descendants of Indian origin, the Hon. Minister had carried out a researc h in order to trace his ancestors. He commenced his research at the Indian Immigration Archives of theMahatma Gandhi Institute (MGI) where he obtained the information that his great grandfather was a 5-year old child when he arrived on Mauritius in 1865. Unfortunately no photograph of the latter was available. The most interesting thing that the Hon. Minister discovered was that his great grandfathe r did not come to Mauritius with his parents, he arrived with neighbours. No further information was found about who had taken care of him and how he managed to survive alone in a foreign country. Most probably he survived by working as child labour which was very common in those days. During his stay in India, the Hon. Minister went to his great grandfather's village to find more. He learnt that hi s great great grandfather's name was Shiv Prasand. He was a very religious man and a great devotee of Lord Shiva. The latter had 5 children among whom his great grandfather was the youngest. The Hon. Minister's great grandfather was only 5 years old when he came to Mauritius, withoutany support. coNTRIBuTIoN foR BhoWaNIpoRE DEpoT IN koLkaTTa As High Commissioner in India, Mr Mookhesswur Choonee wasinstrumental in sensitizing the Central Government of India about Bhowanipore Depot. There was a need to link all the Non-resident Indian (NRI) and Global Organization of People of Indian Origin (GOPIO). The Hon. Minister acted as a 'chain link' as he describes it, to group all the concerned authorities to raise their voice against the harm that was being done to this site. In his own words: \"One of my personal satisfaction as ambassador in India is that I have been instrumental in convincing the Indian Government that untold damage was being done to history. If my country canget the Aapravasi Ghat inscribed as a World Heritage Site, then how could we allow the destruction of Bhowanipore Depotwhich was the point ofdeparture. It was here that the first depot was built for Mauritius followed by the ot her depots meant for Fiji, Tobago, Surinam and Trinidad\". In the near future a museum on indenture will be set up on the location where the Bhowanipore Depot once existed. The nostalgic visit of the Chief Minister of Bihar, the Hon. Nitish Kumar in 2007 to Mauritius helped in raising awareness about theIndian descendants in Mauritius, among the people of Bihar. Mr Nitish Kumar was touched when he listened to the song \"Calcutta se chootal jahaaz.....\" On going back to India, he invited our Prime Minister Dr Navinchandra Ramgoolam to inaugurate the magnificent statue of theFather of the Nation of Mauritius, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam,opposite the statue of the Father of the Nation of India, Mahatma Gandhi at Gandhi Maidaan in Patna.

The building will be used by all descendants of those who had left India. The Hon. Minister believes that the indentured labourers who have settled in different continents have got unique values that need to be researched and promoted. Our Bhojpuri language is one of these oralheritages that link the different countries of the Indentured Diaspora. Mr Mookhesswur Choonee is proud that the Aapravasi Ghat is now on UNESCO's World Heritage List. He remembers initiating some actions to preserve the site during his regime from 1991-1995. Hestopped further industrial development around the site. He describes the Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site (AGWHS) as a \"lieu dem\u00e9moire\" It is important to know our past. The Hon. Prime Minister rightly said in his speech recently:\"We need to know our past in order to control our present and prepare the future...\" Through the setting up of the Beekrumsing Ramlallah Interpretation Centre (BRIC) the AG will now be able to offer more information onindenture, in visual forms to locals and foreign visitors. The BRIC will certainly attract tourists and will eventually help in promoting culturaltourism in Mauritius. As Minister of Arts and Culture, Mr Mookhesswur Choonee, in the long run wishes to preserve all the historic buildings situated in the Buffer Zone of the AGWHS mainly, the United Docks, ex-STC Building, Military Hospital and the Granary. These buildings are historical treasures which according to him, must be upgraded.

Following a request and a project proposal submitted by Global Organization of Indian Origin (GOPIO ) International to the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs (MOIA), in a first instance Indian Government will dedicate acommemorative plaque at Clock T ower, Kidderpore, Demerara (formerly named Guyana) to the memory of Indian indentured workers who left the shore of the subcontinent for a new destiny in January 2011. As stated by the Executive Vice President, of GOPIO International, Mr Ashok Ramsarran, one of the initiators of the project, it will be \"A lasting legacy to present and future generations\". The second phase of the project will be the setting up of a museum and resource centre at Bhowanipore Depot site which is currently under ligitation.

His numerous heirs constructed the estate of Mon-Loisir on an extent of 875 arpents in the year 1820. The first centralisation took place in the year 1838 at Bonne Esperance. When Pilot sold Mon-Loisir to Volcy de Senneville in 1848, the area of the estate which was more than 1000 arpents comprised of the following lands: Cagnet, Pommerol, Bissiere, Dalere Cornet and Mon-Loisir of which 225 arpents were cultivated with sugar cane. In the estate there were two buildings of 41 ft by 27 ft and 41 ft by 20 ft respectively, each having a steam mill and a chimney made of stones. In 1859, Clemence was annexed to Mon-Loisir thus having 500 arpents more, of which, 250 were sugar cane fie lds. The area of the estate which had attained 1600 arpents did not increase during the 60 years which followed but the production of sugar increased from 740 to about 2000 tons in the same period. In 1883, Octave Adam, having inherited the estate, formed the Mon-Loisir company. His rights on this company were bought by Mr Ramnarain Rajcoomar Gujadhur in May 1925 who re-sold the estate and Schoenfeld ar ea to Joseph Lagesse in 1938. Union Flacq in the east and Clemencia within it were bought by Mr Ramnarain R. Gujadhur in the same year. The production of sugar, then, at Mon-Loisir was 5000 tons. In a few years, this figure was doubled and in 1963 there was a break in its record by a production of 35,750 tons. The area of sugar cane cultivated hadreached 5,250 arpents. Following the centralisation of B eau-S\u00e9jour in 1947, the mills of this estate were placed at Mon-Loisir where the two tandems operated simultaneously during five harvests. In 1838, theestate of Bonne Esperance which belonged to Philippe Pommerol comprising 70 arpents, of which 47 were under sugar cane, wasannexed to Mon-Loisir. Sugar camps in Mauritius were built by the sugar magnates just after the abolition of slavery and on the ar rival o f indentured labourers. The Mon-Loisir Sugar Estate had built sugar S\u00e9jour, La Serpe. Most of thesecamps were located in the middle of sugar cane fields far from the main villages. It can be seen from the ruins of these camps that theliving styles of the indentured labourers were in a disguised form of slavery. They were deprived of education for fear that they might climb up the ladder of the society and pose a threat to the plantation owners. Clement Charoux had said \" un coolie, c'est peu de chose, paire de des milliers une notable partie de notre Maurice\". The labourers had to diversify their work in order to improve their economic conditions. The remarks made by Sir Virgile Naz were \"sans eux le prix de l\u00e9gumes, des fruits et du lait serait beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 et la vie serait beaucoup ch\u00e8re\". And Pierre de Sornay had observed cette la terre\". These are the few statements which go on record about the tremendous efforts of the labourers tomake this country prosperous and participate in the development of this land. But at the same time the sugar planters knew t hat they would become wealthy with the help of the Indians. And if the indentured labourers were industrious, saved money and bought land, were they wrong? T oday, many descendants of these indentured labourers have been given \"Voluntary Retirement Scheme\" which comprises seven 'perches' of land to build their houses and a lump sum. This schemewas started in 2002 and deserves to be studied as the condi tions governing the VRS are not fully known and do not appear to be in the best interests of the workers. Have they been adequately compensated by the sugar estate and Government for generations of cheap labour performed under mostly basic conditions. Are they paying for their industriousness, money-saving capability and desire for land. Were they wrong?

It represents not only the development of the modern system of contractual labour, but also the memories,traditions and values that these men, women and children carried with them when they left their countries of origin to work in foreign lands and subsequently bequeathed to their millions of descendants for whom the site holds greatsymbolic meaning.\" This clearly states that Aapravasi Ghat is not just a monument of stone but has much more to share with the world concerning cultures, values, traditions, sufferings and hard work of the people who not only passed through it, but also to great extent of all those who were part of the indenture labour system across the world. An Interpretation Centre in any World Heritage Site is aimed at briefing visitors about the history, architecture and other key features of the site. I personally believe, however, that an Interpretation centre for Aapravasi Ghat must not be simply a place to gather information but should become a medium to communicate with the soul of those persons visiting the place.This interpretation centre is named after Shri Beekrumsing Ramlallah which itself explains the inspiration for concept of this centre and that is whileprogressing further, we shall remain attached to our values, principles and traditions. The BRIC will be housed in a 19 thcentury structure and for us this represented an opportunity not only to safeguard and reuse a heritage building but to also have a blend of historic and contemporary architecture witha strong symbolical identity, the manifestation of whichwill be reflected through art, architecture and landscape of this complex. During the conceptualisation process, an attempt was made to use state-of-the art multimedia tools as well as traditional, local arts and crafts which will be the key aid to communicate to visitors about the sanctity of Aapravasi Ghat. BRIC is aimed at catering to both national and international visitors and with a special focus on activities for children. AGTF has created a team composed of national and international professionals from d ifferent fields such as conservation, architecture, interior design, landscape,Museums, fine art, sculpture, graphic design, traditional crafts, multimedia and films, to name a few to complete this endeavour. The in-house Research and T echnical unit, Administration and AGTF Board are determined to deliver to the best of their ability and see this centre emerge.T o bring this concept to reality is a mammoth task and demands not only hard-work and dedication but also enthusiasm and trust among the team and needless to say all your blessings and wishes.aapravasi ghat Trust fund projects 2010-2011 corinne forest - head of T echnical unit In 2010, the AGTF undertook a number of projects in line with its mandate to preserve and promote the World Heritage Site and other indentured sites. In thecontext of UNESCO periodic reporting for Africa, the priority was to give a legal status to the Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site Buffer Zone (AGWHS BZ) inorder to offer new opportunities for development in the immediate surroundings of the World Heritage Site. The proclamation of the Planning Policy Guidance (PPG) is imminent and would provide an appropriate legal instrument to foster development in the buffer zone. The PPG will be guided by a development plan that will provide a clear vision for the area together with orientations and appropriate measures for development opportunities. Since 2006, AGTF has conducted several studies of the area to propose the most suitable measures responding to local and international expectations for the revitalization of the buffer zone. This also includes an Oral History project to document further the history of the area and consign the life experiences and invaluable knowledge still preserved in the buffer zone. The O ral History and Oral Tradition Unit also collects and documents information on Intangible Heritage such as songs, tales, know-how that were passedon from generation to generation. A preliminary inventory of elements related to indenture was completed in September 2010 and will be developed to constitute awider documentation on the Mauritian Intangible Heritage related to indenture. The objective is to propose elements for inscription on UNESCO representative list of elements of intangible heritage. The collection of such information is highly valued for the historical and anthropological insights it provides and as such, it will be part of the Beekrumsing Ramlallah Interpretation Centre (BRIC) that AGTF is currently setting up. The BRIC project is the priority for the year 2011 as it will offer sui table visitor infrastructures for more than 15,000 visitors a year and provide appropriate interpretative tools to understand the history and specificity of the World Heritage Site. The opening of the BRIC is tentatively scheduled in November 2011. In the meantime, dynamic outreach programmes conducted by a new team ofHeritage Guides/Public Outreach Officers are organised to promote the World Heritage Site in schools and in associations. Their experience with the audience is a major opportunity to evaluate the visitor expectations and propose suitableactivities that will be an integral part of the public programme of the InterpretationCentre. As part of activities for the public and foreign audience, AGTF also hopes to set up a heritage trail by 2013 including the visits of other indentured sites such as Vagrant Depot and Trianon. The conservation of the Vagrant Depot located at Pointe aux Sables is currently under way and will be completed by December 2010. In January 2011, AGTF will start the restoration of the old labourers' barracks located in Trianon since the urgent conservation measures were completed. Further research was started on Trianon Heritage site. The foundation of a building and related artefacts were found during archaeological excavations held in July 2010. This led to a better understanding of the functioning of the sugar estate. However, complementary research will be conducted: the technical team will start an oral history project in Trianon in 2011 to collect life stories of the former employees of the sugar estate. This multidisciplinary approach is essential to allow a n ove rall understanding of the indenture experience in Mauritius. T o share our research on indenture and foster interest on this research topic, AGTF in collaboration with other institutions, intends to organise an international conference on indenture in December 2011. This conference will be a major opportunity to bring together scholars and researchers who conducted academic research on indenture. T he main goal of the conference is to set the stage for the setting up of the Indenture LabourRoute project to be submitted to UNESCO. This is a major opportunity to providetools for the conservation, research and promotion of the history of indenture more widely known since the inscription of the Aapravasi Ghat on the World Heritage List. 21oct:News 23x07.qxd 10/22/2010 8:28 AM Page 910aapRaVaSI ghaT TRuST fuND NEWSLETTER 2 November 2010 During the mid-1970s, the Old Labourers' Quarters ofTrianon was decreed national monument by the Government of Mauritius. Unfortunately, over the last threedecades, it has remained largely neglected and it is already in anadvanced stage of decay. In 1958, Deryck Hollingworth, a British colonial official, writer and admirer of Mauritian history, once explained that our country's national monuments \"constitute a veritable treasure trove which exude edifying imprints of their epoch on the Mauritian identity.\" The Old Labourers' Quarters is such a national monument because it is intimatelyintertwined with the history of the indentured labourers and the sugar estate camps of Mauritius. The Sugar Estate camps Between 1834 and 1924, more than 454,000 Indian indentured labourers were brought to Mauritius mostly to work on the island's sugar estates. In general, after leaving the Aapravasi Ghat or the Coolie Depot, the indentured workers had to settle in one part of the estate which became known as 'Camp des Indiens' as well as 'estate camps' or 'sugar camps'. During the entire period that the indenture system existed in Mauritius and until the late twentieth century, hundreds of thousands of Indian labourers and their descendants lived for many years in these estate camps. Furthermore, on many of the large Mauritian sugar plantations, there were usually hundreds of male and female labourers who lived in those sugar camps with their children. In order to accommodate so many individuals, the large estates had one or several separate estate camps. In 1872, Governor Gordon explained that: \"the house of each immigrant family consisted of one single compartment in a long row of similar habitations, without any aperture whatever for ventilation except the door, and of such moderate dimensions that it resembled rather the cell of a lock up than a human habitation\". During the nineteenth century, camp dwellings consisted mostly of long rows of thatched huts and barrack-style housing which were made mostly of earth, wood, cow dung and cane straw. A few of these living quarters were made of bricks and stones. In the 1800s, in the Plaines Wilhems district, large sugar plantations, such as the one atTrianon, provided some of their labourers with living quarters which consisted of stone barracks. The history of the Structure The Old Labourers' Quarters at Trianon was built sometime during the first half of the nineteenth century. It has often been called a barrack complex and it consists of 15 large chambers and is mostly black in color. The Old Labourers' Quarters is made of basalt stone blocks and has very thick walls. The structure is mostly intact, but decaying very rapidly. There are some documents in the Mauritius National Archives which make brief references to this structure. In 1880, the Protector of Immigrants in formed the manager of Trianon Sugar Estate that the stone barracks, where the Indian labourers were housed, was in an unhealthy state. The Protector took a personal interest in this matter and even summoned the manager to the Coolie Depot, the present- day Aapravasi Ghat and urged him to rectify the matter as soon as possible. In a letter to the estate manager, the Protector emphasized once again: \"Having seen you personally on this matter and heard your explanations that the overgrowth of shrubs and plants around the labourers' stone dwellings is a chief cause of dampness, dirt, and unhealthy conditions in the camp, I have to request that you will immediately take steps to have all such shrubs or plants cut down or entirely removed from the stone structures.\" It was mostly during the winter months that the Indian labourers suffered a lot from the dampness and unhealthy conditions in the stone structure. Unfortunately for them, the manager and owners of Trianon Sugar Estate did not follow the Protector's instructions and the situation remained the same throughout the 1880s. In 1889, Mr. B.A. Francis, the Inspector of Immigrants, in his report on the sugar estates for the Plaines Wilhems district, observed that the estate workers at Trianon, in particular those who resided in stone barracks, still had to endure unhealthy conditions. During the course of that same year, it was reported that there were 1469 Indian men, women and children who lived in the camps ofa history of the old Labourers' Quarters of Trianon: a Rare National Monument Satyendra Peerthum - Researcher - Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund The Old Labourers' Quarters of Trianon, a national monument, during the mid-20th Century (Source: Photo Collection of the Mauritius Chamber) A rare picture of a Group of Indian Indentured Labourers cleaning one of the rivers passing through Trianon Sugar Estate in 1907 (Source: Photo Collection of the Mauritius Chamberof Agriculture) Indo-Mauritian Female Labourers at work on Trianon Sugar Estate during the 1950s Source: Photo Collection of the Mauritius Chamber of Agriculture Continued on Page 12 21oct:News 23x07.qxd 10/22/2010 8:28 AM Page 1011aapRaVaSI ghaT TRuST fuND NEWSLETTER 2 November 2010 In contrast to the monumental and globally recognised nature of Aapravasi Ghat, the Barracks at Trianon represent a rare and unique opportunity to investigate the dailylife-ways of indentured labourers. But howbest to go about such a venture, given that the labourers would not have been recordingaspects of their own lives, nor would their daily existence fall within the purview of contemporaneous writers in any great detail? This is precisely where archaeological workscan provide valuable insight, addingdimensions to the historical accounts thatwould otherwise remain underground and unreported. Archaeological works at the Trianon Barracks which started in 2009 comprised of thearchaeologists who carried out photogrammetry, magnetometry and field walking survey on the area around the standing barracks. The results of the magnetometry survey proved promising and demonstrated areas that could potentially be excavated. The conclusion from the 2009 fieldwork \"suggested that there were additional built structures in this area, related to the sugar estate, and perhaps directly to the Barrack building itself.The extent standing structures are highly unlikely to have been enough to accommodate the totalnumber of indentured workers on the site. Other buildings (potentially identified by our survey) mayhave been demolished at some point, or were less substantial\" (refer to: Mauritius: ArchaeologicalResearch and Agendas. The 2009 Season). T wo rapid phases of works were undertaken in 2010 to complement the 2009 research: the first of these (taking place in May) was aimed at harmonising with the results of themagnetometry. Using the very latest geophysical survey method, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), a team of Slovenian archaeologists were able to provide clear indications of subsoil anomalies (initially it wasnot possible to state whether these wereremains of buildings) as per figure below. This was followed by a two-week seasonexcavation where AGTF , in collaboration with the University of Mauritius and the University of Central Lancashire, revealed the extent and nature of the 'anomalies' shown by the geophysical survey. What the team uncovered was quite unexpected, even with the excellent GPR results to guide them. The foundations of a very large and potential multi-level buildingwas excavated, along with a series of post-holes tentatively suggesting that a wooden canopy surrounded part of the structure. A second trench indicated a drainage systemthat appeared contemporaneous with thisnewly discovered building. Less monumental, but no less significant, the discovery of a small quarter rupee coin links this ancestral community directly with their nation of origin,and pays testimony to everyday facets of life. The coin typifies the practice of paying indentured labourers with Indian currency to facilitate the process of returning money 'home'. Though hardly rare in Mauritius, finding such an artefact associatedwith the barracks, and now this new structure, highlights the relevance and potential of this site. These discoveries start the process of giving us a view of life of the indentured labourers living at Trianon. This is perhaps the most important perspective as it is one that cannot be addressed from othe r sources of evidence. Furthermore, archaeological research provides an important insight into the overallrelationship between the organisation of the sugar estate and the relationship with theimmediate and wider environment; we arethus given a unique view of the sugar industry, as the archaeology of sugar of various facets are being addressed. The research carried out so far has beensystematic and has employed the very latest technology. In this way, we have hopefully demonstrated the value and importance ofarchaeology and thus established a suitable precedent and protocol for future work. The archaeology of the island is far too precious to be researched in anyway but with the mostadvanced methods and techniques at ourdisposal. Site grid, positioned within wider landscape; plan view.

The overwhelming majority among them lived in small huts and only a small number of the indenturedlabourers and their families lived in the stone barracks. In general, the archival records clearly show that by the late nineteenth century, theOld Labourers'Quarters had been in use for several decades and it was already in a dilapidated state. In 1909, a document was submitted to the Royal Commissioners, who were in Mauritius to investigate the island's sugar industry, which briefly mentions a labourers' quarters made of stone at Trianon where Indian workers were housed. Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, the stone barracks or the Old Labourers' Quarters at Trianon were still used to house Indian labourers. In 1960, after the passage ofthe cyclone Carol, the 15 large rooms of this structure were renovated, with eight of the fifteen chambers being provided with asmall kitchen which was built of concrete. The Old Labourers'Quarters was used to house some of the estate workers who had lost their homes during the cyclone. Therefore, until the early 1960s, this structure was still occupied by Indian labourers. Its heritage Value In September 1974, the Old Labourers' Quarters was decreed national monument through Government Notice No.666. In fact, this structure is one of the rare monuments in Mauritius which offers us an insight into what the living conditions of Indian labourers might have been like. In a few years, a fully renovated Old Labourers' Quarters may even form part of a local Mauritian Indenture Route Project which would include the Aapravasi Ghat and the Vagrant Depot. After all, these three national monuments are closely associated with the history of more than seventy percent of the Mauritian population. Between the mid-nineteenth and mid-twentieth centuries, this structure has played a central role in the daily lives of some of the Indian workers and their families who lived on the Trianon Sugar Estate. Therefore, the Old Labourers' Quarters is direc tly and tangibly linked with the way of life of the Indian labourers who lived in the sugar camps during and after the indenture period in Mauritius.

The main results of these archaeological investigations have been placed within the wider setting and published in anaccessible form. Until now, however, scant attention has been paid to the broken and discarded fragments of pottery and glass, metal pieces and building materials. Study of these finds and dissemination of the information that can be revealed from them present a cons iderable challenge. This is because archaeology is concerned in context, that is, the physical relationship between a fragment of an artefact and the placewhere it was found. The peopling of Mauritius emanates from various parts of the world and under very different circumstances. But it was not only people who were imported, everything except ebony, spices and sugar came on ships, as is still very largely the case today. Excavated fragments from China, India, Africa and Europe, to mentiononly the most important ones, document the extent and value of thistrade while at the same time providing insights into changing cultural values through the study of such aspects as to the choice betweenOriental and European designs on ceramics. When excavation began at Aapravasi Ghat, it was hoped that objects would be uncovered which might illustrate day-to-day conditions and practices. However, the entire design of the Depot laid much emphasison cleanliness and hygiene as to anything else. Broken pots and pans, food remains, empty ink bottles, discarded clothing and all the other detritus of everyday activity appears to have been taken off site for disposal. Only one class of excavated materials appears to rela te to the Immigration Depot itself, the building materials. While basalt stones and lime mortar were products of Mauritius, terracotta roofing tiles which came from Marseille slate for lining water tanks was mined in Wales, most of the bricks and all of the sandstone paving flags originated from Scotland and the North of England. Architectural iron elements and fittings, stoneware drain pipes and in the very late 19 thcentury window glass would have come mostly if not entirely from England. In washing and toilet areas, surfaces were coated with bitumen to prevent foul water from soaking into foundations. Thus the excavated fragments of building materials,together with the standing remains of structures that form the core of the present site, indicate the emphasis that was placed by the colonialauthorities on preventing the entry of epidemic diseases into the colony. Study of pottery fragments provides a microcosmic overview of therange and proportions of wares imported into Mauritius from about 1820 to circa 1900. Fragments excavated at Aapravasi Ghat will teachus much about Port Louis. In the future it will be of interest to compare what is found in the urban capital with the findings on the plantations and, indeed, to make comparisons with other excavated coastal sites in the Indian Ocean.

Undergraduates from the University of Mauritius (Source: ghaT TRuST fuND NEWSLETTER 2 November 2010 The history of Forbach estate, one of the most well-known sugar plantations in thenorth of Mauritius during the nineteenthcentury, began in January 1816, when Mr. Joseph Staub purchased a triangularly shaped plotof land of 2 arpents and44 perches for 75 piastres in Rivi\u00e8re duRempart (near the present-day village of Cottage) from Mr. Joseph Collard. Mr. Staub was a former French army officerwho had settled in Mauritius and during the 1810s became a businessman and landowner. In 1818, he purchased from Mr Latour 2 plots of land to the extent of 55arpents which was located close to the land he acquired just twoyears before. According to Guy Rouillard, as early as 1817 or 1818, Mr Staub erected a sugar mill which was a large stone structure and part of his land was brought under sugar cane cultivation. Ho wever, as the years passed by, Mr Staub was determined to expand his small sugar estate and in 1826, he bought 11 arpents and 55 perches from Mr. Joseph Jacques. During the course of that same year, he acquired almost 300 arpents of land through landtransactions with individuals such as Damain, Joseph Jacques and Pitchen who were some of his landowning neighbours. During thefollowing year, Mr Staub paid 900 piastres for 9 arpents of land. Thus, between 1816 and 1827, or over a period of more than a decade, through several successful land transactions, Mr Staub was able to bring hundreds of arpents in one specific part of Rivi\u00e8re du Rempart within his possession and which formed the basis for the establishment of Forbach Sugar Estate. Between the late 1810s and 1830s, Forbach's consisted of slaves of Creol e origin or Creole born in Mauritius. They usually worked under the supervision of slave commandeurs who reported directly to their master, Mr. Staub. From the archival sources, it seems that the slaves were well treated and provided with adequate foodand clothing. In August 1827, Joseph Staub died and this markedthe end of the founding era of Forbach estate. Between the late 1820s and early 1840s, t he inheritors of Mr Staub, such as Nicolas Staub, his son, continued to expand the sugar estate although at a much slower pace when compared with previous years. In 1842, Forbach estate covered a total area of 743arpents and the inheritors of Mr Staub sold it to a group of individuals, namely Aristide Aubin, Vincent Bourgault Ducoudray and H. D\u00e9roul\u00e8de. During the mid-19thcentury, Forbach became one of the few sugar plantations in British Mauritius to have a windmill which was used in the processing of sugar cane. This windmill was finally closed in 1852. Many years later, in 1867, Mr. Wieh\u00e9 and Mr. Aubin purchased Forbach Sugar Estate. In 1875, as part of the process of the centralization of the Mauritian sugarindustry, Forbach became part of Labourdonnais Sugar Estatewhich covered an area of 1,390 arpents. Between 1840's and early 20 thcentury, indentured Indian labourers formed the backbone of Forbach's workforce. The archival records indicate that the Indianworkers were well treated and provided with adequate food, clothing, and medical treatment. It is interesting to note that Mr Hurryparsad Ramnarain, the famous trade union leader, was born in the estate camp of Forbach in 1914. During the ea rly 1940's, Messrs Ramnarain and Sharma Jagdambee actively tried to fight for better working and living conditions for the Labourdonnais estate workers. In order to achieve this noble objective, he tried to organize them into labour associations but with very little success. In 1943, he was prosecuted by Mr. Wieh\u00e9 for trespassing on his property when Ramnarain tried to meet a group of sugar cane workers who resided in the estate camp of Forbach. During that same year, the sugar workers, who were descendants of indentured labourers and lived and work on Forbach, played an important role in the labour protests which shook the sugar estates in the district of Riviere du Rempart. These important events, such as the labour unrest at Forbach Sugar Estate, are vividly described in the official depositions and the Moody Commission Report of 1943.an overview of the history of forbach Sugar Estate (1816-1943) Dr. Satteeanund peerthum, (Senior Historian and Ex-Ambassador of Mauritius to the United Nations) & Satyendra peerthum, Researcher - Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund The Windmill of Forbach and a Sugar Chimney in 1870 (Source: The photo originally belonging to Mrs. H.

The deliberations at theworkshop reinforced myearlier impressions that we,the Inter-culture Group at Banaras Hindu University,Varanasi, India and AGTF areinvolved in similar activities of identifying, collecting,documenting, preserving and interpreting the Intangible Cultural Heritage; location ofcultures, however, does make difference, I began with the assumption and my fieldwork in Mauritius confirmed it. In the Indian context, while collecting women's folk songs related to birth, marriage, and other occasions, I seek to understand the position of women in India. In fact, i n my second presentation at the workshop, \"Women's folksongs: A Saga of Conformity and Dissent\" I shared my findings with the co-participants.As a researcher, I had an eagerness to know about the status of women in the MauritianMauritian society - are there any similaritiesbetween position and status of Indian Womenand that of Mauritian women? Through this newsletter, I would like to share myexperienc e of interacting with women in Mauritian villages, the first thing that appealedto me was the position of unmarried women in the Mauritian society. In Indian society, marriage is the sum and all of a girl's life. A renowned Indian psychologist, Mr Sudhir Kakkar is of the view that the formation of the girl's identity takes place after marriage. And marriage is usually settled by the parents, and dowry is the decisive factor. In one moving Bhojpuri song, collected in the field, the girl is agonized to see that her father and brother face disgrace while they go searching a suitable groom because they have no money. The girl requests her mother andsister-in-law to ask her father and brother tocome back home. She tells them that there are two ways she can leave her house either by marriage or by death. She prefers to embrace death if she cannot leave her home in doli (palanquin) after marriage. She will be carriedaway on an arthi (wooden frame). Life becomes a burden for her and as well as for her parents, if the girl is not married. Some educated girls prefer to remain single. Manyeligible and qualified girls have to remainunmarried because their parents cannot afford to arrange for the dowry. When I rel ated this to the women in Mauritian village, they were surprised because exchange of money is not atall a consideration in marriage. It was a pleasant surprise how the people who havemigrated, have maintained the sanctity of marriage bond by not selling grooms formoney but by preserving marriage as a bond, as a union of two souls and two hearts andalso of two families. In Ancient times, in Indiansociety, money was not exchanged at the time of marriage. In Ramcharitmanas and other such texts, we do get description of the gifts which fathers willingly gave to their daughters. During my stay and fieldwork in Mauritius, I observed that the girls are happy even if they were single. Mauritian society is relatively free from another bane of Indian society-barrier ofcaste and religion; one major reason Iperceived for absence of demand of dowry is that the closed system of parents marrying their children only in their own caste/religion does not prevail here in Mauritius; barrier ofcaste/religion is broken off and merit of the girl becomesthe main consideration. Another remarkabledifference noticed was theway women who have lost their husbands lived. Some of those to whom I spoke hadlost their husbands and they were relatively not very old, some of them were in their early forty's and fifty's. The women, as a practice wore colourful sarees and they were not required to abstain from enjoying small pleasures of life. In my field sessions, I noticed that the widowed women equally danced and sang asdid the other women in India; it is somethingunimaginable. Life ceases to exist for a womanwho is either a widow or deserted by her husband; the restrictions were too many inearlier times, but still some of the prejudices prevail because of which women are expectedto conform to a certain code of behaviour. The feminist writers, world over, are pleading for state of singlehood to break free from the shackles of patriarchy and Mauritian society proves that for their happiness, women are not just dependent on men, they can be happy, sing, laugh and dance within the institutions ofmarriage and also outside it. Another observation very relevant is, when I had singing sessions here in India, women would sing and sit at one place even when they sang songs of joy, somehow, somewhere, somekindof lack of exuberance is there but in Mauritius,most of the songs, jhumar, lalana,kajari have extremely joyful tunes. Women in grou p would sing and dance which is a rare sight in India. I have seen that women in Mauritian societyhave freedom of choice - to take decisions - to live their life fully and vibrantly. As a folklorist, we begin our explorations first by identifying the hypothesis about a society on the basis of initial observations and find folklore whichsupports and corroborates it. I hope to find more evidence of positi on of Mauritian women in extensive research.WoMaN IN MauRITIaN SocIETy Dr archana kumar - Associate Professor - Department of English - Banaras Hindu University Folk songs and dances by Mauritian women 1516aapRaVaSI ghaT TRuST fuND NEWSLETTER 2 November 2010 What kind of Museum for aapravasi ghat World heritage Site? Corinne Forest - Head of Technical Unit Museums long suffered from an image of a place devoted to the elite with no connection to the population at large. However, traditionally, museums are entrusted to preserve, educate and promote culture with a view to anchor the fundamentals of a nation. In museums, this is achieved through the presentation of objects that best represent the nation's past. Upon contact with physical testimonies, visitors are expected to produce an understanding of what they see but how far can this be achieved when visitors generally visit museums portraying a foreign culture? The distance instituted between visitors and museum objects may create a frustration for visitors who find themselves face to face with works of ar t presented out of their context of production. The museum environment stretches this distance as it is not a usual place of social interaction where visitors can find familiar references. Museums are indeed atemporal places where objects stand for the history and culture of an entire nation which demands background knowledge to understand what is presented. Visitors find themselvesout of reference ont o which they can rely to understand what they see. This led professionals to debate on how to improve visitorexperience since 1980s. Curators and Museologists have since thenresorT ed to new methods of communication with a view to provideinterpretative tools reducing this distance to allow visitor understanding. The AGTF was concerned that collections presented may not speak to the specificities of th e Immigration Depot and to the global indenture experience. This is the reason why the concept of Interpretation Centre was preferred to that of Museum relying on the presentation of collections. The objective of the Interpretation Centre is to produce an understanding and help the interpretation of the remains of the World Heritage Site. T o fulfill this purpose, the Beekrumsing Ramlallah Interpretation Centre will largely rely on new technologies, multimedia in particular, and interpretative displays tocreate a close relationship between the World Heritage Site andvisitors. T o devise the exhibition programme, the Research T eam needed to understand visitor expectations to come to a successful result. Since 2006, the AGTF has set up a public programme proposing various activities and collects the view s of visitors through surveys and direct contact with visitors. This was a tremendous help in devising an appropriate exhibition programme that would speak to the population as a whole and also provide tourists with a different insight of Mauritian Culture. Surveys clearly showed that the audience expected more information on the history of the World Heritage Site and indenture as an international phen omenon. T o serve this purpose, the Interpretation Centre project was divided in two phases: the first phase focuses on the physical evolution of the Immigration Depot within its surroundings that now constitutes the Buffer Zone. It seemed an essential element to valorize this area of Port Louis where severaloldest buildings in Mauritius still stand. It is also important to recall inwhat context the Im migration Depot evolved through time since indenture had a direct impact on this area, most of which is now forgotten. This first part will be a major contribution to the understanding of the specificity of indenture in Mauritius that will be mainly presented in the second phase of the project. The second part of the Interpretation Centre will indeed put into perspective the start and the development o f indenture in Mauritius before it spread around the world as a system of recruitment that led to the migration of 2 million people. The Interpretation Centre hopes to be a place speaking to all types of audience, including the youngest, and take visitors to experience insights of our history that made Mauritius so special and unique.

The 28-year young man, subsequently known as Seewoodharry Buguth came from the village ofSoondurpore Korreeanea found in Patna District. While the reason heleft India remains unknown, three years after his arrival Seewoodharry was free of his obligation to complete five years of industrial residence. On August 27, 1858, he entered into a partnership with two other old immigrants to establish a store in Grand Port. By 1866, Seewoodharrynow described regularly as a landowner in Notarial deeds, was actively purchasing, leasing and clearing large tracts of land in Plaines Wilhems. For the next fifteen years, until his death in 1881, he would continue to figure in the district's economic life as a merchant, landowner, and businessman of some consequence. In this capacity, he not only helped to inaugurate the large-scale subdivision of sugar estates and other properties known as the grand morcellement, also heralded the active role Indian immigrants were to pla y in this process of social and economic transformation. Seewoodharry Buguth was one of the first people in Mauritius who was involved as timber merchants and his business place was found at La Marie. He employed nearly 1000 workers and furnished timber planks to the Railway Department. He spoke English, Bengali and Sanskrit.Following Seewoodharry's death in 1881, one of his sons Rambelas also known as Ra mpersad, joined with Monogilal to purchase three plots of land, with a view to acquiring the right to clear 3,650 arpents of forest in Black River and borrow Rs 24,000 from Jean Baspiste Jourde for this purpose. The visit to Mauritius of Mahatma Gandhi in 1901, marked the rise of political consciousness among Indian community. The Mahatma advised them to take interest in politics and to preserve their culture and religion. As the maker of world history in politics, religion and non- violence his message was received with enthusiasm among the Indiansand Muslims of this island. The Mahatma knew that the Indians and Muslims immigrants had worked hard for the development and prosperity of this island and they deserved the same treatment and status as the non-Indians. Mahatma Gandhi's influence and talks had triggered the Seewoodharry's family to put his ideologies into practice. So the first Indo-Mauritian \u00e9lite who manifested the desire to serve the Mauritian community was Mr Harry Parsad Seewoodharry Buguth, one of thesons of Sewoodharry IndianImmigrant No. 152217. He was born on June first, 1871 at La Marie, Curepipe. Hismother's name was Suttoa, an Indian immigrant No. 110698 who came originally fro m the village Koorsowmy. Hereceived his primaryeducation at Glen Park AidedSchool and his Secondary education at Royal College ofCurepipe. He was the first Indo-Mauritian studentto be admitted at theRoyal college in 1884. Hepassed his School Certificateexaminations and took employment as clerk at theGovernment Treasury. After some time Harry Parsad Seewoodharry Buguth abandoned his post and ran timber bu siness together with his cousin Boodhun Lallah. Later on, he became the first Indo-Mauritian Land Surveyor. He hired 5,000 acres of crown land with the government which was known as crown land Buguth near Mare aux Vacoas. Mr Buguth was one of the pioneers in cattle breeding, a planter of sugar cane and also the owner of several buildings at Bougainville, Farquhar and Lionel Cox Streets at Curepipe. The f ifth General Election of Mauritius for the District of Plaines Wilhems was held on January 25, 1906. There were 1691 electors in the voters' roll of Plaines Wilhems. Out of the 1691, there were 146 Hindus, 86 Muslims, 12 Chinese and 1447 of general population. Four candidates, Gilbert, Pitot, Boucherville and Buguth contested for the one seat of the District. harry parsad Seewoodharry Buguth was the fir st hindu who stood as a candidate for the general Election for the in the history of Mauritius.The result of the General Election for the District of Plaines Wilhems was published in the Government Gazette No. 17 of Friday, 26 January, 1906. Guilbert George obtained 521 votes, Boucherville Alatike 247 votes, Seewoodharry Buguth 204 votes and Pitot Arthur 201 votes. It is also to be noted that one of t he greatest achievements of the Seewoodharry's family is the upbringing of Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam also known as Kewal during his childhood and adolescence. It would be exactly 100 years ago that Kewal's brother, Ramlall and his wife Sosil, who were related to Seewoodharry sent him to stay at Harry Parsad Seewoodharry Buguth's place at Bougainville Street, Curepipe. He attended the scholarship class a t the Curepipe Boys' Government School.

This criterion highlights the importance of intangible heritage. In line with World Heritage Committeerecommendations, to 'Undertake research on indentured labour to consider the extent, scope and impact of the indentured labourDiaspora around the world;' The Trust Fund has embarked on research on intangible heritage. The Oral History Unit of the AGTF has been entrusted with this responsibility. A major project was initiated in 2009 to collect oral histories of elderly persons who have resided in sugar estate camps. Some 400 interviews have been collected so far and are currently being analysed with the assistance of anthropologists. The AGTF has also undertaken research on intangible heritage in other 'indentured' coun tries. A three-day workshop on Bhojpuri Culture was organized by the Oral History Unit of the AGTF from T uesday 13 to Thursday 15 July 2010 at the University of Mauritius in collaboration with Banaras Hindu University (BHU). The theme of the workshop was 'Bhojpuri at the crossroads' and the objectives of the workshop was to Identify the impact of modernity on Bhojpuri, its changes and hybridisation; identify similarities and differences between Bhojpuri traditions and culture in Mauritius and India; reinforce collaboration among scholars and professionals to create a research network on Bhojpuri as part of the IndenturedLabour Route Project; to assess research undertaken on this subject and propose new research directions; launch a research programme to encourage the preservation of the Bhojpuri; make recommendations and propose activities for dissemination and knowledge of Bhojpuriculture; to preserve Bhojpuri language and culture and its understanding by other groups. The opening of the workshop was marked by the vibrant speeches of the Minister of T ertiary Education, Hon. Rajesh Jeetah and the Minister of Arts and Culture, Hon. Mookhesswur Choonee. In their speeches both dignitaries emphasized the role of Bhojpuri as a primary tool for the transmission of culture and ancestral values and the need to preserve this language through promotion and involvement of the younger generation. Dr Archana Kumar, Associate Professor, Department of English, BHU, the guest speaker for the event. presented the results of her research in her two papers, \"Living Traditionof Bhojpuri Women Folksongs in India: The Dynamics of Continuity and change\" and \"Women's song: a saga of conformity and descent\".General introductory presentations were also made by Mr RavirajBeechook, University of Mauritius on \"History of Immigration of Bhojpuri speaking to Mauritius\"; \" Constituting an inventory: promotion and preservation of Intangible heritage\" by Corinne Forest and \"Hamare Itihas: The Use of Bhojpuri in Rural Mauritius during the First Half of the 20th Century: A Historical Analysis\" by Satyendra Peerthum. Scholars, researchers, folklorists, singers, students, lovers and bearers of Bhojpuri traditions and the members of the public at large attended the workshop. Discussions that were held during the three days covered various topics such as \"Bhojpuri: a way of life (Bhojpuri Culture)\", \"Language: emergence an Bhojpuri\", Cultural Heritage\" and\"Preservation of Intangible Cultural Heritage.\" Some of the resolutions adopted during the workshop towards the promotion of Bhojpuri culture included the production of a DVD of Bhojpuri folk songs of India and Mauritus in collaboration with the BHU, to be launched on 2ndNovember 2010; teaching songs at primary level and organisation of song/ g ame competitions in Bhojpuri for pre-primary school children; publishing e-newsletter on Bhojpuriculture; researching on bhojpuri bringing out academic journalto foster debates on Bhojpuri matters; Creating research network,interaction between diaspora countries, exchange of knowledge, experience and materials andsetting up a local network of professionals working on Bhojpuri culture; fostering teaching of bhojpuri culture, standardization of Bhojpuri language;and creation of a dictionary on Bhojpuri language to develop an \"agreed standardisedspelling and grammar\" which is in line with the Government programme stipulating that Bhojpuri (and Mauritian Kreol) will beintroduced in schools as optional subjects; Setting up projects forUniversity/secondary school students to discover intangible heritagein their villages, localities - collect folktales, sayings, songs, artefacts, learn about food habits, folk medicine and clothing and jewelry; training preprimary teachers; Organising workshop for them on how to introduce Bhojpuri in Oral form. Current activities include a UNESCO - funded \"Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage\" across the island. The AGTF has also been organising living exhibitions whereby folk songs and dances have been presented by young and old generations. On these occasions, traditional game players and craftsmen had been invited to exhibit their know-how and traditional delicacies, some of which were also on sale. Working on the Intangible Cultural Heritage project has been a learning experience for the staff working on it. They have learnt to cope with expressions of strong human feelings, sometimes painful memories of the past or memories which make the informants think, smile and laugh. These experiences will be given their full recognition in future publications of the AGTF and in the future Interpretation Centre.

He stayed at Curepipe for at least 10 years and he enjoyed his stay in the company of the members of the Seewoodharry and Lallah families. It is to benoted that both families are related. As mentioned in Anand Mulloo's book entitled \"Father of the Nation'' it was in such an atmosphere that young Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, a well-behaved and studious boy, inquisitive, fond of reading and debates and who was never punished for misbehaviour, went through his secondary education and passed his Senior Cambridge Examinations.Furthermore, Kewal uncle's place that is at Harry Parsad Seewoodharry Buguth's house at Bougainville S treet, Curepipe was buzzing with political talks. Kewal's uncle had been siding with Manilall Doctor who had allied the Indo-Mauritian with the Action Liberale. So, it was here that Kewal developed a taste for politics which keptticking in his mind. Just imagine what would have been the state of Mauritius, had we not have the contributions of such people in our country. So, we have to pay tribute and be very thankful to all those Indian Immigrants and their descendants who had struggled hard for the development and welfare of Mauritius in order to make it a better place to live in.

Kerven and Y. Martial) Over the past 160 years, the Central Market has served as the main market for the city of Port Louis and is the second largest market on the island. It is an important part of the urban architectural heritage of Mauritius which dates to the early Victorian Era. The Trou fanfaron police Station was built during the mid-1770s. It was occupied by French troops and it was used to defend Port Louis harbourand town from British invasion.The French used to call it \"Corps de Garde\". For more than 160 years, it has been used as a military post in Mauritius which made it one of the oldest and longest serving posts from the French period. It was decreed a National Monument in 1951. The Mauritius postal Museum was built between 1767 and 1772. This site was usedas a prison and it was commonly called the \"Bagne\". Those condemned for minor crimes were imprisoned here and sentenced to hard labour. Ratsitatane, a Malagasy nobleman and military commander was imprisoned here as a British State Prisoner. During the late 1830s, the prison served as the first 'depot' for indentured labourers who were caught as vagrant.

New metho- dologies are being put intopractice in order to uncover the lost history of Mauritius. Thus OralHistory forms a crucial part in this respect. It is through Oral History that we are documentingthe intangible heritage. Oneof the elements of intangible heritage that comes under the theme 'food and health' is traditional recipes. As nourishment, food consists of tangible, material substances which humans consume. But the knowledge and practice of food preparation, etiquette of eating and symbolic meanings tied to various foods are all intangible. The UNESCO Living Human Treasures program states that: \"although the techniques for producing artefacts and even preparing food can be put in writing, the actual act of creation has no physical form. The performance and the act of creation areintangible; embodied in the skills or techniques of those who do them.\" Below is a recipe of a sweet \"Ariselu\" a dish brought by immigrants of Andhra Pradesh in India. In Mauritius it is mostly known as Adourson. Ariselu is an Indian sweet made from glutinous rice which is left to rest for days and shaped and fried until it becomes of golden colour. It may be served at any time, but has a special ritual significance. Further itsymbolizes prosperity during Pasapu rituals and prayers like Rambhajanam. This recipe was transmitted to me by my grandmother. ariselu - Ingredients: 3 cups of Rice 1 \u00bd cups of sugar \u00bd teaspoon ginger powder\u00bd teaspoon Ghee \u00bd teaspoon Cindammon milk powder150g sesame seed1 teaspoonful bicarbonate of sodaMethods: 1) Soak the rice for 2 hrs after which let it dry for 2 hrs and grind it. 2) Next prepare a syrup (Boil a cup of water with 2 cups of sugar). 3) In a bowl add the grounded rice, ginger powder, ghee, cinnammon, milk powder, 50g sesame seeds, oneteaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda and then pour the syrup and mixed well. 4) Let the dough chill for 2 days.

They fought against the circumstances and one day after innumerable difficulties and boundless struggle they achieved freedom. This is a sacred place which can be referred as the place of struggle for Mauritius. This place should always remain sacred and by remembering our struggle it is important to give inspiration to our cultural and national unity. India is the heart of Mauritius. The infinite deepnessof this heart lies in the Indian culture. That is why even today Mauritius is making its land firm through its cultural activities. Our culture is the example of brotherhood and world peace. Due to this greatnesscharacters various time we became slaves. Peopletook undue advantage because of our modesty. But now both India and Mauritius will protect its freedom and cultures at any cost. My best wishes to the great and dynamic Mauritians.
