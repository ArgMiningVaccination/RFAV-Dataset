The purpose of this book is to simplify the cause and the correction of all disorders, regardless of the name or nam es. As we eliminate and correct one disease, we correct them all, for every disease is corrected by the same process of cleansing and building positive good health. Man's mastery of disease will only be final when ignorance and fear are overcome by proper observance of all laws pertaining to the creation of bones, flesh, and blood. Through eons past and on even into the present, man has been held and still remains in bondage of misery and suffering while witchcraft and quackery, whether licensed or not, hav e run the gamut of the healing field of misinformation . At last the basic cause of disease is no longer a mystery. The basic cause is the habits of improper diet, inadequate exercise, negative mental attitudes, and lack of spiritual attunement, which comb ine to produce toxic conditions and malfunction of our bodies. The elimination of the cause of illness is the obvious and only way to healing and health. The elimination of the habits that cause illness is done through the positive approach of developing p roper habits that cause health combined with corrective techniques that remove the ill effects of our former incorrect ways. A group of simple and automatic laws of the master plan, for creative living, has given the sufferer his answer and release from hi s various forms of disease. As we work knowingly with these laws we find a very simple answer to our may aches, pains and disorders. To most of us these laws have been replaced with the laws of \"Kill o r Cure\" with the many devastating practices and miracle poisons. These truths are self -evident as we look into the history of our diseases and see our failures in our constant search for release. If these records are not enough then let him go on and on with his never ending aches and pains until his suffering s have finally created a desire for knowing these many truths. When we finally become sick of being sick, then we are ready to learn the truth and the truth shall set us free. This diet will prove that no one needs to live with his diseases. Lifetime freed om from disease can become a reality. To be complete, a healing system must be able to cover the entire field of human experiences \u2014 physically, mentally, and spiritually. Any system, which denies any part of this trinity, fails in its attempt to heal to t he same extent to which it denies any part or parts. We realize that many psychological, mental and social stresses can cause our conditions. However, the above tensions can and do encourage us to eat to excess \u2014 both good and bad foods \u2014 which in turn creat es our diseases. The following program has been tested and approved since 1940 in all sections of the world as the most successful of any diet of its type. Nothing can compare with its positive approach toward perfection in the cleansing and healing field. Nothing can compare with its rapidity and completeness. It is superior in every way as a reducing and body conditioning diet. As the originator of this superior diet, I humbly and yet proudly offer it to you, confident that you will receive vigorous good health from its use. Many of the principles that are presented in this book may be completely contrary to evrything you have believed and studied. Regardless of whether you believe them or not, it does not alter the fact that they may be true. Before you attempt to argue or deny these facts, test them as given to you and use them until you have proven them either right or wrong. Every statement and bit of information given is the accumulation of years of experience, research, and results -therefore given a s facts. Make these tests and be completely satisfied that you, too, can experience the same results. At no point will any attempt be made to confuse you with theories that cannot be proven or that will not prove themselves to be right. There is no desire to give you complications, or words that have little meaning, or \"double talk\" without clarity. Simplicity and accuracy will be the theme through the entire book. This system accepts no limitations as to the ability of the body to heal itself. A LETTER FR OM ONE WHO TRIED IT ALL Missing a meal won't hurt! By Herman Schneider Since the days of Jesus Christ, who fasted for 40 days, men and women have abstained from food for many reasons; for health, for political ends, an for spiritual enlightenment. However, the average person, not familiar with fasting, believes he will certainly die if he misses a meal. When you hear of a person dying after being lost in the woods or at sea for two or three days. It was not lack of food that caused his death, but it was pan ic and fear that killed him. Most people in fairly good health can go for many days without food but the body must have water, although there is a fast called \"the dry fast\" which employs dry bread but no liquid. However, this type of fast cannot be endure d for too long a period. There is general disagreement in the health field on the best way to detoxify the body. The Hygienists, who are mostly followers of Dr. Herbert Shelton, the very capable exponent of fasting, using only distilled water, and enemas a re taboo. Dr. Shelton and other Hygienist doctors have fasted thousands of people, many regaining their health, as a result of the fast. Of course, after the fast, it was necessary for them to follow a healthful way of life. The Hygienists are strict veget arians with the emphasis on raw foods and proper combinations. Dr. Walker and Dr. Airola advocate fruit and vegetable juice if fasting is needed. In Europe, naturopaths use the vegetable broth and vegetable juice fast rather than the water fast. The above doctors also employ colonics and enemas, these being vital for the success of the program. The purpose, in their opinion, is to rid the body of the toxins loosened by the cleanse. Thirteen years ago, I had extremely high blood pressure. I didn't feel too well, so I went to the doctor. He gulped as he said to me, \"your blood pressure is 200 over 120.\" He told me that he would start me on medication, but I did not think that drugs were the answer for me, so I asked him, \"How long do I have to stay on drugs? \" He replied, \"Your hypertension will get progressively worse, so you will have to stay on the medicine forever.\" He continued, \"in thirty years of practice, I have had only two patients able to discontinue the medicine.\" I was not pleased with his answer, so I said, \"You are looking at your third patient who will get off the medicine.\" He looked at me and shrugged his shoulders as if to say, \"He is insane.\" He said, \"I have hundreds of patients on medication for high blood pressure, and you are the only on e who makes a fuss.\" I took one drug for a week, but it made me dizzy, so he changed the medicine. He gave me one drug for high blood pressure and another for nerves, which slowed me down; Then another drug to pep me up from the drug that was slowing me do wn. CHANGED PROGRAM I decided this program was not for me so I headed to Dr. Shelton's in San Antonio, Texas. They took all my drugs and threw them away and put me to bed to start my fast. I never dreamt I would go without food so long, but my fast lasted for 21 days on just distilled water. It is during the fast that conditions a person may have, but is not yet aware of, show up, as the body begins throwing off the poisons. The man fasting in the next room passed gallstones on his 24th day. He never kne w he had gallstones before his fast. He really suffered until he passed his stones, after long years of study in natural healing and Herbology, I now know he could have gotten rid of the gallstones in a much more pleasant way, using apple juice, olive oil and lemon juice. I, myself, had mild reactions outside of extreme weakness. My biggest problem was painful cramps caused by gas in the intestines. I also had some bleeding as the bowel tried to empty itself with no bulk ingested to help it move. My fastin g problems would have been much less had they given me an enema, but the Hygienists do not believe in enemas, laxatives or herbs. They say nature must take its course. The faster is kept in bed most of the time, using one's energy to detoxify. During the 2 1 days of fasting, I lost 21 pounds, which I gradually gained back during the rebuilding process, which should equal the fasting time. So I had to stay off of my job for 42 days. The fast was not pleasant, although you lose your desire for food after the t hird day, but the results were very pleasant and made it worthwhile; my blood pressure was now 120 over 80, which is perfect. Since this fast, thirteen years ago, I have fasted many times on vegetable juices and used colonics as advocated by Dr. Walker. Th e fasts were of short duration, lasting from two to five days. About a year ago, I went to a chiropractor for an adjustment. We talked for a while and he told me he was on a book called the \"Master Cleanser\" by Stanley Burroughs, a natural healer for some forty or more years. The cleanse starts with a herbal laxative tea both morning and evening. If this is not sufficient to clean out the intestinal tract, he advises a salt -water wash. These stops are necessary to remove the toxins loosened by the lemon jui ce cleanse. I was then to drink between six and twelve glasses of lemonade, which consisted of lemon and maple syrup in proper proportions, with a small amount of cayenne added to wash out the mucus loosened by the cleanse. Mr. Burroughs' book, \"The Master Cleanser\" describes the entire program, including directions for diabetics to get off insulin. I, myself, believe that diabetics should be under the care of their doctors if they choose to follow the Burroughs program. For diabetics, he does not advocate that they use maple syrup in the beginning, but to use blackstrap molasses. Lemon juice, maple syrup and blackstrap molasses are very high in all mineral and vitamins. I stayed on the \"Master Cleanse\" for 12 days, during which I exercised, jogged, worked, and felt stronger each day, as the cleanse proceeded. I gradually tapered off the cleanse, with juices and broth, of three more days. During the entire time I was never hungry. The most important part of the cleanse or fast is knowing how to come off of t he fast, allowing the body to gradually adjust itself to handling solid food again. Improper procedures can cause illness and even death. As my weight was stabilized at the start of the cleanse, I only lost about four pounds in twelve days. People who are overweight will loose much more. Mr. Burroughs' program calls for a vegetarian diet, so this part of the program was easy for me to accept because I have been a vegetarian for years, using mostly raw foods. I go on this cleanse two or three times a year. I just read in Linda Clark's book that she has used this cleanse for years. Mr. Burroughs says that it is perfectly safe to stay on the \"Master Cleanser\" even up to 40 days, as the lemon, maple syrup or blackstrap molasses and cayenne pepper act as both a cleanser and a body builder. From my viewpoint, the Burroughs cleanse gave me the best results, allowing me to be active and energetic through the entire period. I haven't been back to the medical doctors, but my blood pressure is still normal after all th ese years. A WORD ABOUT \"EPIDEMICS\" AND \"GERM -CAUSED\" DISEASES Throughout the history of man, there have been constant epidemics of many diseases. Little has been known or understood as to why these things happen. (In earlier times they were thought vario usly to be the work of the devil, punishment from God, or poisoning of the water supply by an enemy). In recent times it has been believed that these many diseases are contagious and that germs have spread them. This belief has created a monster as the med ical field has steadily found stronger and more potent drugs, poisons, and antibiotics in their constant effort to destroy what they believe to be the cause. A large variety of vaccines and antitoxins have been developed because of the belief in a large variety of bacteria and viruses. Always the belief is that we must kill these forms of life in order to keep us free from disease. Yet, in spite of massive research, manufacturing, and wide use of these items, mankind still goes on suffering from an ever -increasing variety of disease and disorders with no let up in sight. Disease, old age, and death are the result of accumulated poisons and congestion throughout the entire body. These toxins become crystallized and hardened, settling around the joints, in the muscles, and throughout the billions of cells all over the body. It is presumed by orthodox medicine that we have a perfectly healthy body until something, such as germs or viruses, comes along to destroy it, whereas actually the building material for the organs and cells is defective and thus they are inferior or diseased. Lumps and growths are formed all over the body as storage spots for unusable and accumulated waste products, especially in the lymphatic glands. These accumulations depress and deterior ate in varied degrees, causing degeneration and decay. The liver, spleen, colon, stomach, heart, and our other organs, glands, and cells come in for their share of accumulations, thus impairing their natural action. These growths and lumps appear to us as forms of fungi. Their spread and growth is dependent on the unusable waste material throughout the body. As the deterioration continues, our growths increase in size to take care of the situation. Fungi absorb the poisons and try to take the inferior mater ial from the organs. This is a part of Nature's plan to rid the body of our diseases. When we stop feeding these fungi and cleanse our system, we stop their development and spread; then they dissolve or break up and pass from the body. They will not feed o n healthy tissue. There is a simple set of laws, which explains this action. Nature never produces anything it does not need and it never keeps anything it does not use. All unused material or waste is broken down by bacteria action into a form that can be used over again or eliminated from the body. All weak and deficient cells, caused from improper nutrition will also be broken down and eliminated from the body. We spend a good portion of our lives accumulating these diseases and we spend the rest of our lives attempting to get rid of them \u2014 or die in the effort! The incorrect understanding of the above truths has led uncivilized and civilized nations alike to search for some magic \"cure\" in all kinds of charms, witchcraft, and unlimited kinds of obnoxious poisons and drugs. In general, they are worse than useless because they cannot possibly eliminate the cause of any disease. They can only add more misery and suffering and shorten one's life still further. It has been reported in many books and magazine articles that many new diseases and disorders have been created by orthodox and hospital methods. As we continue to search for more and more magic \"cures\" we become more and more involved with complicated varieties of disease. A simple understanding and action has always proved to be the best to eliminate our negative actions and reactions. Germs and viruses do not and cannot cause any of our diseases, so we have no need for finding various kinds of poisons to destroy them. In fact, man will never find a poison or group of poisons strong enough to destroy all the billions upon billions of these germs without destroying himself at the same time. These germs are our friends, there are no bad ones, and if given a chance will break up and consume these large a mounts of waste matter and assist us in eliminating them from the body. These germs and viruses exist in excess only when we provide a breeding ground in which they can multiply. Germs and viruses are in the body to help break down waste material and can d o no harm to healthy tissues. Do you think that if an insignificant, microscopic microbe can appear and make you sick when you were well and strong, that you have any possibility of getting strong enough to throw them off at any time thereafter? Do you thi nk that any destructive poisons can make it possible for you to get well and faster? All diseases, regardless of their names, come within this understanding as only varied expressions of the one disease of toxemia. As noted earlier, we are constantly tol d that the medical researchers are about to make a big breakthrough and finally conquer all your diseases. This breakthrough will never happen until their false approach to science is replaced by the natural science of the secret of life energy and its cre ative action within us. Through an open - minded approach to the truth about the life force or energy, we can know the underlying facts behind epidemics and eliminate their cause. Basically, we create all of our diseases because we have never taken the time to discover the true foods meant for man's use. We can create healthy bodies by using the right foods and eliminating highly toxic and mucus -forming foods. As you learn more about nutrition you will become aware of the many foods that cause excess mucus in our bodies and then realize that this condition becomes the breeding ground for all kinds of germs . We know that throughout nature everything moves in cycles, constantly changing, constantly cleaning out the old and building the new. Consequently, as a p erson reaches the \"point of no return,\" a point where his accumulations have reached the limit of what the body can tolerate, then a rapid change takes place or he dies. The cycle has come to the point where a good house cleaning must be started, and one o f nature's most effective methods is to start loosening and eliminating these poisons with bacteria action. As this action progresses, we become sick and feverish, large amounts of mucus are eliminated, diarrhea increases the discharge of waste material, a nd all of our resources go into action to clean us out as fast as possible to prevent these poisons from killing us. When this happens do not panic and resort to the unnatural action of drugs and antibiotics, which can only defeat natures laws. The drugs s top the natural changes by suppressing the cleansing action and store the poisons in the body to cause future problems. If we know these danger signals and engage our abilities in their maximum effort, we can survive the ordeal and live a normal life until further accumulations trigger another life change. However, the logical procedure is to prevent these accumulations from forming in the first place \u2014 then we have no need for the discomfort of the severe cleansing process. As the above conditions happen to more and more people at the same time an \"epidemic\" is set in motion. Very often an epidemic occurs after holiday feasting. Even the very best of foods in excess can create problems. If only a sufficient amount of good food is consumed, a severe cleansing -illness -will not be required as the normal operation of the body will then be adequate. Deficiencies do exist, primarily because of improper diet and improper assimilation. These deficiencies also produce toxins because of the deterioration of the cells. So we still have only one disease, and with one simple process we can eliminate all so -called diseases of whatever name. As we expel the disease producing toxins from our bodies, we must also restore the deficiencies. Thus, a cleansing diet must also inclu de proper material for building as the waste material is eliminated. There is still one more factor involved to make the total process completely understandable. Since germs do not cause our disorders, there must be another logical reason for the trigger ing of an epidemic. This is a matter of simple \"vibration.\" The better the physical and mental condition a person is in, the higher becomes his vibration, but as he steadily becomes clogged with more and more waste matter, his vibration goes constantly dow nward until he is ready and in need of a change. If he then comes in contact with one or more who have already started the cleansing process, he picks up the vibration of change and all his functions are triggered into the same action. This can happen to a ny size group of people in similar condition and then an epidemic is on its way. The person with a toxic free body and undisturbed mind is the one unaffected by the epidemic. THE ORIGIN OF THE LEMON JUICE DIET The lemonade diet, about to be described, has successfully and consistently demonstrated its eliminative and building ability. It may be used with complete safety for every known type of disease. Lemons and limes are the richest source of minerals and vitamins of any food or foods known to man, and t hey are available the year round. Thus the diet may be used successfully any month of the year and virtually any place on earth. Its universal appeal and availability make it pleasant and easy to use. The lemonade diet first proved itself in the healing of stomach ulcers over forty years ago. Permission was given by Bob Norman to share this incident of my first experience with the diet. One day, shortly prior to my first meeting with Bob, I was inspired to write this diet in complete form as a means to g ive relief and to heal stomach ulcers in ten days. I rapidly wrote it down in detail and waited for a test case \u2014 which always seemed to come when it was needed. Bob Norman had suffered with his ulcer for nearly three years. During this time he had tried everything then known to get help, but nothing in the way of medicine or treatment gave anything but monetary relief. He had to eat something every two hours or he was in extreme pain. For the preceding three months he had been living on little other than go ats milk. His doctor wanted to operate but he refused to have it done. He figured anything would be better than that. He told me I was the last person he would go to. If I couldn't help him, he would just go home and die, as life was hardly worth living in this condition. An explanation of the cause of an ulcer is necessary at this point. There is a sodium coating covering the entire inside wall of the stomach, which, if it remains intact, will prevent the digestive juices from digesting the stomach itself. However, when any form of flesh food enters the stomach, the meat attracts the sodium in the same way as the walls of the stomach. Some of the sodium is drawn from the walls and gathers around the meat, thus preventing the digestion of the meat in the stomach and at the same time depleting the sodium on the walls of the stomach. As one continues to eat meat and a deficiency of sodium in the diet occurs, the sodium lining is not being replaced on the walls of the stomach. The digestive juices then start dig esting the stomach, producing what we call an ulcer. When this occurs, all orthodox methods to heal the ulcer fail completely. Sometimes the meat can remain in the stomach for two or more hours and begin to ferment and spoil. To be broken down and digested it must pass on into the small intestine. All forms of meat take longer to digest than fruit and vegetables do. Chicken and other fowl take the longest of all. Just because meat is already a form of flesh, it does not follow that it is readily usable by o ur bodies. In fact, just the reverse is true. When one considers that flesh foods of all kinds are extremely toxic, it becomes apparent that they are an extremely undesirable form of nourishment. In the eating of meat, one must take into account all of our eliminative organs. They are made primarily to take care of our own wastes. When we add animal flesh, containing the wastes of its cells (or drugs and other unusable material), extra work is required of these organs and various forms of trouble will event ually develop. Remember that all solid food must be broken down into a liquid form to be carried by the blood before it can nourish the body. Flesh foods of all kinds (including fish) take much longer to reach this state and are less useful to the body tha n fruit, vegetable, and seeds. Back to our story. After all of Bob's explanation, I asked him if he would like to have his ulcer healed in ten days. He answered, \"Yes\" so I handed him the paper with the diet on it. He read it over carefully and handed it b ack with the explanation that he could never do that as all expert advise for three years had told him to never use citrus, and this was nothing but lemonade. Since orthodox methods had failed completely to heal his ulcer, I reasoned that their advice coul d be wrong. And since the lemonade diet was contrary to the accepted practices (which had failed), logic told me that it might do the healing. I knew it could do no harm and was confident only good could come from it. I explained to Bob that if all of this expert advice was correct, his ulcer would have been healed three years ago! It was just possible that the very thing he was told not to use might be the one thing he needed. He thought it over and decided, \"All right, I'll try it... even if it kills me!\" H e was assured that this would not happen. After five days of the diet Bob called me. Even though he had no pain from the beginning, he was afraid that suddenly all the old pain would return and he would be miserable again. Formerly he had to eat something every two hours or he would be in pain, and the previous day he had gone eight hours without food or drink \u2014 with no pain, yet he was still apprehensive. I assured him that since he had no pain for five days, he would be all right and to continue for the fu ll ten days. On the eleventh day his doctor examined him and the ulcer had been completely healed. Needless to say, his doctor was most amazed because he had given Bob a complete examination, including X -ray, prior to the diet and had recommended an immedi ate operation because he would not have long to live otherwise. Many other cases of ulcers followed with the same constant results in only ten days. Numerous other disorders were also corrected during the ten -day period, in person after person. IS THE LEM ONADE DIET ALSO A REDUCING DIET? As a reducing diet it is superior in every way to any other system because it dissolves and eliminates all types of fatty tissue. Fat melts away at the rate of about two pounds a day for most persons \u2014 and without any harmfu l side effects. All mucus diseases such as colds, flu, asthma, hay fever, sinus and bronchial troubles are rapidly dissolved and eliminated from the body, leaving the user free from the varied allergies which cause difficult breathing and clogging of the s inus cavities. Allergies exist as a result of an accumulation of these toxins and they vanish as we cleanse our body. People who are over -weight often experience these difficulties, and the more they continue to eat the toxic fat -producing foods, which cau se their obesity, the more their other ailments multiply. The eating or drinking of mucus -forming foods brings about mucus disorders. In other words, if you have these diseases, you at them! As we stop feeding our family mucus - forming foods, we can elimina te their mucus and allergy diseases for the rest of their lives. The types of disease that are a result of calcium deposits in the joints, muscles, cells, and glands are readily dissolved and removed from the body. Cholesterol deposits in the arteries and veins also respond to the magic cleansing power of the lemonade diet. All skin disorders also disappear as the rest of the body is cleansed. Boils, abscesses, carbuncles, and pimples all come under this category. These conditions are again Nature's effort to eliminate poisons quickly from the body. All types of infections are the result of these vast accumulations of poisons being dissolved and burned or oxidized to produce further cleansing of the body. Therefore, rapid elimination of the toxins relieves the need for infectious fevers of all kinds. Infections are not \"caught,\" they are created by Nature to assist in burning our surplus wastes. Yes, the lemonade diet is a reducing diet, but much more. Just as many other disorders also cleared up at the same time when it was used to heal ulcers, when it is used as a reducing diet other ailments are also corrected in the process. People build strong, healthy bodies from the correct foods or they build diseased bodies from incorrect foods. When disease does beco me necessary, the lemonade diet will prove its superior cleansing and building ability. THE MASTER CLEANSE OR LEMONADE DIET Purpose: *To dissolve and eliminate toxins and congestion that have formed in any part of the body. To cleanse the kidneys and the digestive system. To purify the glands and cells throughout the entire body. To eliminate all unusable waste and hardened material in the joints and muscles. To relieve pressure and irritation in the nerves, arteries, and blood vessels. To build a healthy blood stream. To keep youth and elasticity regardless of our years. WHEN TO USE IT? When sickness has developed \u2014 for all acute and chronic conditions. When the digestive system needs a rest and a cleansing. When overweight has become a pr oblem. When better assimilation and building of body tissue is needed. AND HOW OFTEN? Follow the diet for a minimum of 10 days or more \u2014 up to 40 days and beyond may be safely followed for extremely serious cases. The diet has all the nutrition needed during this time. Three to four times a year will do wonders for keeping the body in a normal healthy condition. The diet may be undertaken more frequently for serious conditions. HOW TO MAKE IT? 2 Tablespoons lemon or limejuice (approx. \u00bd lemon) 2 Tables poons genuine maple syrup (Not maple flavored sugar syrup) 1/10 Teaspoon cayenne pepper (red pepper) or to taste 8 oz water, room temperature Combine the juice, maple syrup, and cayenne pepper in a 10 oz glass jar w/lid and fill with the water. Shake it up and drink. (Cold water may be used if preferred.) Use fresh (organic) lemons or limes only, never canned lemon or limejuice nor frozen lemonade or frozen juice. The maple syrup is a balanced form of positive and negative sugar and must be used, not some \"substitute.\" There are three grades of maple syrup. Grade A is the first run \u2014 mild in taste, sweet and with fewer minerals than the other grades. It is more expensive and less desirable but it may be used. Grade B is the second run with more minerals plus more maple taste. It is more suitable for the diet and is less expensive. Grade C is the third run with even more minerals and still stronger taste of maple and slightly less pleasant for most people, although acceptable in the diet. It is lower in price. As Grade C is less expensive it can be used as an excellent sweetening agent in preparing foods. The strong maple flavor blends very well. The maple syrup has a large variety of minerals and vitamins. Naturally the mineral and vitamin content will vary ac cording to the area where the trees grow and the mineral content in the soil. These are the minerals found in average samples of syrup from Vermont: Sodium; Potassium; Calcium; Magnesium; Manganese; B1, B2, B6, C, Nicotinic acid and Pantothenic Acid are also present in the syrup . Some uninformed operators of the sugaring of the maple syrup do use formaldehyde pellets, run through polyethylene tubing but there are many more that don't. Search out and demand the kind that does not use formaldehyde. Spring Tree of Brattleboro, Vermont does not use it. This is the kind I recommend. Dozens of letters weekly, from around the world highly praise the many superior benefits of the lemonade diet. Thus, we must conclude t hat since it does so much for so many it is truly The Master Cleanser. The following is a quote form one of the letters: \"I tried the lemonade diet with exceptional beneficial results. I would like to order at least six at whatever your wholesale price w ould be \u2014 I know I will need many more as I do push the books. I believe they are the best in their field.\" An ideal formula involves freshly extracted juice from the sugar cane (readily available in India, but not generally in the US at the present time): 10 oz. Fresh sugar can juice (medium hot or cold) 2 Tablespoons fresh lime or lemon juice 1/10 teaspoon cayenne (red pepper) or to taste Another possible but lesser replacement could be pure sorghum. (Do not use for Diabetes). It does not produce equal or close to the benefits of maple syrup. WHAT ABOUT THE USE OF HONEY? Honey must not be used at any time internally. It is manufactured from the nectar picked up from the flowers by the bees \u2014 good enough in itself, perhaps \u2014 then predigested, vomited and stor ed for their own future use with a preservative added. It is deficient in calcium and has many detrimental effects for the human being. According to one authority, honey is \"a magical and mystical word in \"Healthfoodland\". It is one of the most over promot ed, overpriced products being sold to gullible health food advocates. The great value attributed to honey is delusive... honey is only a little less empty and more dangerous than sugar.\" Just as with alcohol, honey, being predigested, enters the blood direct ly, raising the sugar content very rapidly above normal. To correct this, the pancreas must produce insulin immediately or possible death can occur. More insulin than necessary is likely to be produced, and the blood sugar level then drops below normal. Th is can produce blackout spells and even death if it goes to low. When blood sugar is below normal, a person will feel depressed. The regular use of honey can create constant imbalances, which in turn will adversely affect the normal function of the liver, pancreas and spleen. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are the results of the use of unbalanced sugars. The balanced sugar in maple syrup and sugar can juice causes no dangerous side effects. Artificial, synthetic, and refined sugars have no place in a natura l diet. SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DIABETICS Diabetes is the result of a deficiency diet consisting in part of white sugar and white flour. The lemonade with molasses is an ideal way to correct this deficiency. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY FOR BEST RESUL TS. The molasses supplies the necessary elements for the pancreas to produce insulin. As the necessary elements are supplied to the pancreas, the amount of insulin taken may also be gradually reduced \u2014 as an example. On the first day use a scant tablespoon of molasses to each glass of lemonade and reduce insulin by about 10 units. Daily from then on reduce the insulin as you increase the molasses to 2 full tablespoons per glass. When this proportion has been reached the insulin can normally be eliminated; th en replace the molasses with 2 tablespoons of maple syrup in each glass. Make regular checks of the sugar level in the urine and blood to satisfy you and eliminate any possible fear. Vita Flex and color therapy may be used to advantage to stimulate the liv er, pancreas, and spleen and thus insure proper use of the minerals supplied. Many people have found they no longer have need for insulin. They must be sure to follow every detail of the recommended diet as explained in the following pages. Blend a part of the lemon skin and pulp with the lemonade in a blender for further cleansing and laxative effect. (Note: commercially procured lemons may have had their skins dyed with yellow coloring and may have been subjected to poisonous insect sprays \u2014 be sure to pee l off the outer skin if you cannot get uncolored, organically grown lemons.) The properties in the lemon skin also act as a haemostatic to prevent excess bleeding and to prevent clotting internally should there be any such prevailing condition. (Don't worr y\u2014 normal conditions will continue during menstrual periods.) Adding the cayenne pepper is necessary as it breaks up mucus and increases warmth by building the blood for an additional lift. It also adds many of the B and C vitamins. Mint tea may be used occasionally during this diet as a pleasant change and to assist further in the cleansing. Its chlorophyll helps as a purifier, neutralizing many mouth and body odors that are released during the cleansing period. HOW MUCH DOES ONE DRINK? Take from six to t welve glasses of the lemonade daily during the waking period. As you get hungry just have another glass of lemonade. NO OTHER FOOD SHOULD BE TAKEN DURING THE FULL PERIOD OF THE DIET. As this is a complete balance of minerals and vitamins, one does not suff er the pangs of hunger. Do not use vitamin pills. All solid food is turned into a liquid state before the blood can carry it to the cells. The lemonade is already a food in liquid form. For those who are overweight, less maple syrup may be taken. For those underweight, more maple syrup may be taken. For those who are underweight and worried about losing more weight, REMEMBER, the only things you can possible lose are mucus; waste, and disease. Healthy tissue will not be eliminated. Many people who need to g ain weight actually do so near the end of the diet period. Never vary the amount of lemon juice per glass. About six glasses of lemonade a day is enough for those wishing to reduce. Extra water may be taken as desired. HELPING THE CLEANSING ALONG As this is a cleansing diet, the more you can assist Nature to eliminate poisons, the better. IF YOUR SYSTEM FEELS UPSET, IT IS BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT HAVING SUFFICIENT ELIMINATION. Avoid this possibility by following the directions completely. Above all, be sure you have two, three, or more movements a day. This may seem unnecessary not eating solid food, but it is Nature's way of eliminating the waste it has loosened from the various cells and organs in the body. They must leave the body some way. It would be just t he same as sweeping the floor around and around and never removing the dirt from the house if the wastes were not passed out. The better the elimination, the more rapid will be the results. A LAXATIVE HERB TEA is found to be the best helper for most perso ns. It is a good practice to take a good laxative herb tea right from the beginning \u2014 the last thing at night and first thing in the morning. There are several good laxative teas. They are best taken in a liquid form. Buy them in your health food store. ANOTHER CLEANSING AID: INTERNAL SALT WATER BATHING As it is necessary to bathe the outside of our bodies, so it is with the inside. Do not take enemas or colonics at any time during the cleansing diet or afterwards. They are unnecessary and can be extremely harmful. There is a much superior method of cleansing the colonic tract without the harmful effects of customary colonics and enemas. This method will cleanse the entire digestive tract while the colonics and enemas will only reach the colon or a small par t of it. Colonics can be expensive while our salt -water method is not. DIRECTIONS : Prepare a full quart of lukewarm water and add two level (rounded for the Canadian quart) teaspoons of sea salt. Do not use ordinary iodized salt, as it will not work prope rly. Drink the entire quart of salt and water first thing in the morning. This must be taken on an empty stomach. The salt and water will not separate but will stay intact and quickly and thoroughly wash the entire tract in about one hour. Several eliminat ions will likely occur. The salt water has the same specific gravity as the blood, hence the kidneys cannot pick up the water and the blood cannot pick up the salt. This may be taken as often as needed for proper washing of the entire digestive system. If the salt water does not work the first time, try adding a little more or a little less salt until the proper balance is found; or possible take extra water with or without salt. This often increases the activity. Remember, it can do no harm at any time. Th e colon needs a good washing, but do it the natural way \u2014 the salt water way. It is quite advisable to take the herb laxative tea at night to loosen, then the salt water each morning to wash it out. If for some reason the salt water cannot be taken in the m orning, then the herb laxative tea must be taken night and morning. SHOULD I TAKE \"SUPPLEMENTS\"? Some people want to take vitamin pills or food supplements while on the diet. This frequently fails to produce the desired result. There are many reasons. As the lymphatic glands become clogged, they are no longer able to assimilate and digest even the best of foods. As we cleanse our bodies and free our cells and glands of toxins that clog and paralyze our assimilation, we free our various organs and processes to do their proper jobs. Note earlier about all the necessary vitamins and minerals are in the lemonade, and therefore we do not need an additional supply in most cases. Vitamin pills and supplements do not grow on trees as such but rather come to us in f ruits, berries, vegetables and plants. Man will never take a group of natural or synthetic foods; process and combine them in a variety of products, and come up with anything equal or better than the original. They have lost much of their basic life and en ergy by combining them according to a man made concept. Many dangerous side effects can occur because of improper and unequal balances present. Stay with the natural laws of balance. First one must decide if God is right or if man is right. If God is right then man and his ideas of processing \u2014 tearing apart and rearranging \u2014 are likely to be wrong. Later, as we consume a more complete variety of foods, we find our sources of vitamins and minerals complete and in forms that are easily assimilated \u2014 it should n ot be necessary to return to these supplements even if one is accustomed to taking them. The sources of good food are steadily being enlarged as people become more educated concerning them. Search these sources and rely on them for your total nutritional n eeds. The lemon is a loosening and cleansing agent with many important building factors. The ability of the elements in the lemon and the maple syrup working together creates these desired results. Its 49% potassium strengthens and energizes the heart, stimulates and builds the kidneys and adrenal glands. Its oxygen builds vitality. Its carbon acts as a motor stimulant. *Its hydrogen activates the sensory nervous system. Its calcium strengthens and builds the lungs. Its phosphorus knits the bones, stimulates and builds the brain for clearer thinking. Its sodium encourages tissue building. *Its magnesium acts as a blood alkalizer. Its iron builds the red corpuscles to rapidly correct the most common forms of anemia. Its chlorine cleanses the b lood plasma. Its silicon aids the thyroid for deeper breathing. The natural iron, copper, calcium, carbon, and hydrogen found in the sweetening supplies more building and cleansing material. It truly is a perfect combination for cleansing, eliminating, h ealing, and building. Hence, supplements are not needed during the diet and may actually interfere with its cleansing action. WHAT ABOUT THE USE OF VITAMINS? Vitamins and minerals have always been a necessary part of natural living. Not satisfied with God 's plan, man has attempted to improve the situation by separating them from fresh live foods, then processing and combining them to conform to his concept of what they should be. Not satisfied with the finished product, attempts were made to produce them s ynthetically. It was big business \u2014 and we became a world of \"pill pushers,\" whether they were needed or not. More often they were not needed. No one really knew if the pills were needed, or how many \u2014 people just took them because they might have a deficien cy! Just how these vitamins and minerals should be balanced and formulated led to many differences of opinion. A large variety of experts, in processing and manufacturing of pills, disagree as to how the many billions of pills should be made. They all have different formulas and claim theirs are the best even though much is lost in the processing. However, even without any clear consensus as to their worth and use, they were manufactured and processed; therefore they must be sold with no thought as to possi ble side effects from overdosing or imbalances. The producers and the sellers make millions of dollars with little regard for the true needs of the consumer. In reality, the whole process could have been completely avoided. Our Creator has already done a better job of making sure we receive all the needed vitamins and minerals in a perfectly balanced form. Only the finest of natural foods in their original package are good enough for bringing complete energy and life to build and retain a healthy body. Any time man attempts to improve on God's formulas and plans; the result is bound to be a failure. The simple rules to complete nutrition include all the vitamins and minerals needed by all mankind and all animals. Our Creator has given the right food for the right animal for complete nutrition. This is also true for man. When these foods are properly prepared and eaten, there is nothing more that man can do to prepare a better food. As we eat the correct foods without excesses, the body will produce ALL the ne eded vitamins. Foods grown properly, in complete, mineral -rich soil, will have all the minerals in them. Thus, we have no need for vitamin -enriched foods, created synthetically by man, or for extra minerals. All refined and devitalized foods must be comple tely eliminated from our diet. If refined and devitalized foods are eaten, then and only then does man have any need for additional supplements. Just how much and what combination, even with long and complicated tests,, will probably never be determined, so this form of unnatural nutrition will always be lacking. Such a plan is a very poor substitute for the right way. WILL IT MAKE ME FEEL BAD OR WEAK? In the cleansing process, some people experience a tremendous stirring up and may even feel worse for several days. It is not the lemonade that causes the trouble, but what the lemonade stirs up in the system that causes our dizziness and other disturbances. Vomiting may occur under certain conditions; increased pain may be felt in the various joints of the b ody; dizziness may develop on certain days. If weakness develops at any time, it is the result of poisons circulating through the blood stream rather than a lack of food or vitamins. This diet gives a person all the vitamins, food, and energy necessary for the full ten days or longer in a liquid form. Rest and take it a little easier if you have to - although most people can go about their regular business without difficulty. Keep right on with the diet; don't give up or \"cheat\" by eating a little food or yo u may destroy the benefits. Even though the lemon is an acid fruit, it becomes alkaline as it is digested and assimilated. It is, in fact, our best aid toward proper alkaline balance. There is no danger of \"too much acid.\" Alcoholics, smokers, and other drug addicts will receive untold benefits from this diet. The chemical changes and the cleansing have a way of removing the craving and the many probably deficiencies. Thus the desire for the unnatural types of stimulants and depressants disappears. The usua l cravings experienced and suffered in breaking away from drugs, alcohol, and tobacco no longer present themselves during and after this diet. It is truly a wonderful feeling to be free from slavery to these many habit -forming and devitalizing elements of modern living. Coffee, tea, and various cola drinks, as habit -forming beverages, also lose their appeal through the marvels of the lemonade diet. HOW TO BREAK THE LEMONADE DIET Coming off the lemonade diet properly is highly important \u2014 please follow the directions very carefully. After living in a semi -tropical and tropical climate for many years, I find that people have increasingly turned to a raw fruit, nut, and vegetable diet. Following is the schedule for people who normally follow such a natural vege tarian diet: FIRST AND SECOND DAY AFTER DIET: Several 8 oz. Glasses of fresh orange juice as desired during the day. The orange juice prepares the digestive system to properly digest and assimilate regular food. Drink it slowly. If there has been any digestive difficulty prior to or during the change over, extra water may be taken with the orange juice. THIRD DAY: Orange juice in the morning. Raw fruit for lunch. Fruit or raw vegetable salad at night. You are now ready to eat normally. For those who have characteristically lived the unnatural way of meat, milk, refined and devitalized food, it may be best to change over as follows, gradually adopting the raw fruit, nut, and vegetable diet: FIRST DAY: Several 8 oz. Glasses of fresh orange juice as desired during the day. Drink it slowly. SECOND DAY : Drink several 8 oz. Glasses of orange juice during the day \u2014 with extra water, if needed. Some time during the afternoon, prepare a vegetable soup (no canned soup) as follows: RECIPE FOR VEGETABLE SOUP Use s everal kinds of vegetables, perhaps one or two kinds of legumes, potatoes, celery, carrots, green vegetable tops, onion, etc. Dehydrated vegetables or vegetable soup powders may be added for extra flavor. Okra or okra powder, chili, curry, cayenne (red pep per), tomatoes, green peppers, and zucchini squash may be included to good advantage. Brown rice may be used, but no meat or meat stock. Other spices may be added (delicately) for flavor. Use salt delicately as a limited amount of salt is necessary. Learn to enjoy the natural flavor of the vegetables. The less cooking the better. ________________________________________________ Have this soup for the evening meal using the broth mostly, although some of the vegetables may be eaten. Rye wafers may be eaten s paringly with the soup, but no bread or crackers. THIRD DAY: Drink orange juice in the morning. At noon have more soup: enough may be made the night before and put in the refrigerator. For the evening meal eat whatever is desired in the form of vegetables , salads, or fruit. No meat, fish, or eggs; no bread, pastries, tea coffee, or milk. Milk is highly mucus forming and tends to develop toxins throughout the body. (Milk, being a predigested food, has been known to cause various complications in the stomach and colon, such as cramps and convulsions. The calcium in milk is difficult to assimilate and may cause toxins in the form of rheumatic fever, arthritis, neuritis, and bursitis. The resulting lack of proper digestion and assimilation of the calcium allows it to go into the blood stream in a free form and it is deposited in the tissues, cells, and joints where it can cause intense pain and suffering.) FOURTH DAY: Normal eating may be resumed, but best health will be retained if the morning meal consists of our type of lemonade or fruit juice: and, of course, if a strictly fruit, vegetable, seed and berry diet is followed. If, after eating is resumed, distress or gas occurs, it is suggested that the lemonade diet be continued for several more days until the system is ready for food. Recap of the steps to be taken in the diet . Be careful to read the entire instructions so that the diet will be of the best benefit to you. First prepare yourself mentally to follow in detail the entire directions and continue as long as is needed to make the necessary changes. One of the best signals of the completed diet is when the formerly coated and fuzzy tongue is clear pink and clean looking. During the diet it becomes very badly coated. The Night Before starting the diet commence drinking laxative tea. In the morning take the salt -water (or) laxative tea. This should be done each night and morning during the diet \u2014 rare exception \u2014 if diarrhea develops. When diarrhea is ended then continue above directions. Now the lemonad e formula (see page 10 for details) Breaking the diet: Be absolutely sure you follow the directions very carefully to prepare your body for normal eating (our way). Do not over eat or eat too soon. Serious problems (nausea) can occur if detailed directions are not followed. HOW DO I GET MY PROTEIN? Often the question is asked about the need for amino acids, and animal protein foods. The need is highly exaggerated, as only 16% of our body is protein. The answer to the question is very simple. We first need to understand that pure protein is primarily nitrogen, with oxygen, hydrogen and some carbon. We all know we get a large share of our oxygen and hydrogen needs from the air along with some carbon. There is four times the amount of nitrogen in the same air as there is oxygen, hydrogen and carbon combined. Since we are able to utilize and assimilate a large amount of our needs of these elements into our bodies we are able to assimilate and build the nitrogen also into our bodies as protein. This is done by na tural bacteria action, which is capable of converting it to our use. From the combination of the best of foods and clean air we are able to create our own amino acids, just as well as the animals do. We never try to feed amino acids to the animals. Thus we are able to eliminate the need for toxic dead animal flesh and have no further need to worry about our constant source of protein. Eat only the best variety of fruits, berries, nuts, vegetables, seeds and sprouted seeds for a further complete source of pr otein. People who smoke cannot pick up the nitrogen from the air so easily, but will still get enough from proper food without the use of animal flesh. For your well -being, however, elimination of smoking is a must. Many people believe that eating meat giv es them strength. If this is so, then why are the strongest animals in the world vegetarians? Did you ever stop to think that the animals you do eat are vegetarians? Where did they get their strength? All the meat -eating animals find it necessary to sleep 16 to 1 hours a daily because of excess toxins. The meat -eating animals live a very short life. God has supplied such a bountiful supply of fresh, wholesome food that there is never a need to kill an animal for its more toxic flesh in our modern civilizati on. FEEDING YOUR BABY The mother should nurse all her babies if at all possible. There is no real substitute. Cows and goats mild is for their babies and is not suitable for the human baby. It creates mucus and other problems just the same as in adults, including colds and infectious diseases. Correct food, reflex stimulation, and color therapy will assure the mother all the milk she needs for her baby. Where mother's mild is not available the best replacement is coconut milk \u2014 see recipe. With this, give t he baby about 8 ounces of lemonade in between regular feedings. To the regular formula for lemonade add about double the amount of water until the infant is about 6 months old and then gradually change to regular strength. A nursing baby should begin to be weaned in 9 months and be eating regular foods after that. Commercially prepared baby foods and baby formulas are unfit for the balanced need of a healthy baby. Recent articles and TV reports indicate these foods are very undesirable always. Prepare fresh food from fruit, vegetables, berries, and seeds. The baby has no need for any of the animal or fish products. Use pure maple syrup instead of sugar or honey when sweetening is needed. Your baby deserves only the very best of live fresh foods. IS WATER FA STING A GOOD THING? The subject of water fasting often presents itself. I am very much opposed to several days or weeks of water fasting. It is too dangerous and is unnecessary to achieve the desired results of internal cleansing. Many people are already deficient as well as toxic. The longer they do without food, the greater becomes the deficiency. The lemonade diet can more than match all the possible good obtained from fasting and at the same time will rebuild any possible deficiency. Ordinarily with fas ting it is necessary to take it easy by resting or staying in bed. On the contrary, with the lemonade diet there is no need to become a useless member of society \u2014you may live an active, normal life. Many workers at hard labor have found they are able to do more and harder work while on the lemonade diet than on their normal diet. After one has attained a clean, healthy body, and then desires to fast for purely spiritual reasons, thirty or even forty days can cause no harm. Your friends and acquaintances may find this lemonade diet to be the answer to their aches, pains, or other troubles. Even if there appears to be nothing wrong, sometimes those who are \"never sick\" will feel even better. Let your friends receive this benefit too. A NEW TREATMENT FOR AN OL D ALIMENT: DROPSY (EDEMA) Dropsy is one of the most difficult and least understood of the many expressions of toxemia. It consists of an accumulation of fluid in the body tissues. Varied attempts to correct this condition have met with little or no success . The main treatments can give only temporary relief and the final result, as these treatments fail to produce any change, is death from internal drowning. To achieve fast relief and lasting correction, one must completely understand the causes. Then our unusual and simple approach to an ancient disease will achieve quick and lasting results. As with so many other diseases, dropsy represents a vast accumulation of toxic wastes. These toxins accumulate because our eliminative organs are unable to take care o f them as fast as they enter or are formed in the body. As accumulations steadily increase, they first appear to us in liquid form. If they are not eliminated from our body, they are automatically and gradually dehydrated or crystallized. They are then dep osited in any and all of the available spaces throughout our cells, glands, and organs. This continues until a saturation point is reached and then Nature reverses the action and slowly dissolves the crystallized and dehydrated material. This change is the body's final effort to save the life from being snuffed out from complete stoppage of all glands and organs. Only in a liquid or semi -liquid form can we eliminate our toxins. Usually, by this time our eliminative organs are overworked and clogged, our hea rt, liver, and kidneys suffering the most, so they cannot carry off the liquid toxins. The body then steadily increases in size until it can no longer sustain life. The correction for this otherwise fatal condition is simple, fast, and effective. Just foll ow directions and the results will be most satisfactory. Now, we will describe the treatment. Start the patient off on the lemonade diet. This begins the internal cleansing process. Next, secure one hundred (100) pounds of coarse rock salt (which may be pu rchased at a feed store). Cover the bottom of the bathtub with about two inches of salt. Unclothe the patient and wrap the person in a wet sheet. Then lay the patient on the salt and add salt to about two inches above their body so that the entire body is surrounded with the salt. The room should be 80\u00ba or slightly higher so the patient does not get chilled. (The tub may be warmed first with hot water before adding the salt. Let ALL the water out first before adding the salt.) Leave the patient in the salt for approximately one hour. Be sure you have given them several glasses of hot lemonade with cayenne pepper in advance . Remove the patient from the salt wand wrap them in a woolen blanket to keep them warm. Extra heat may be used if necessary. Repeat this treatment every other day or daily, of not too weak from the rapid changes. This may be repeated until all the swelling has gone down or the toxins are removed. The first application may not produce notable results, but from then on a rapid change should b e observed. Be sure to keep the dropsy victim on the lemonade diet until a big change has taken place, even if it continues for ten, twenty, or thirty days. Color and Vita -Flex may be used also and will provide tremendously increased action and elimination . IMPORTANT NOTE: The salt may be used over and over on the same patient, but not on any other. Each person must have his or her own salt. Bathing one or two times a day, especially during this diet, is especially necessary. We eliminate wastes through th e breathing, the skin, the kidneys, and the colon and from the sinus through the nose. The most wastes are eliminated by breathing; next in order are the skin, the colon, the kidneys, and depending on the individual, from the sinus. Often we eliminate larg e quantities of wastes in the form of mucus as we develop colds or flu. One can see how important becomes our elimination by the skin. Even when in good condition, it is important to bathe once or twice daily to remove this waste from the surface of the sk in, thus allowing it to breathe properly. These baths will help to eliminate obnoxious odors while we cleanse our body. Frequent steam baths will also help. THE SIMPLE ART OF NUTRITION There are simple, well -defined laws or rules to follow to obtain the u tmost from the preparation and use of foods. These laws are natural, easily understood, and readily demonstrated. Only when we follow these laws and live within their simplicity does our blood become pure and our minds serene. As we live within these simpl e laws we can dismiss all thoughts of disease, and it will never be necessary to seek help or relief from any outside source. This excellent health has been achieved in thousands of cases involving every variety of disease condition. All diseases and adver se conditions respond and disappear as we discover the healthy way. Cleansing, building, and retaining is the master plan of this simple from of nutrition. Before building and retaining can be realized, cleansing of the various toxins, poisons, and congest ion must be complete. I offer you the finest in the cleansing and healing field in the form of the lemonade diet. In reality, the chemical or chemicals present in the citrus do not actually make the body resistant to disease; rather, they eliminate the cau ses of disease by their cleansing action. I have already discovered these fantastic new wonder chemicals many years ago, and they are already being used in the form of the lemonade diet with tremendous success around the world. There is no need to further create these chemicals as God has already done a better job of it than any group of men can ever hope to do, regardless of their education or abilities. These chemicals are already in the citrus fruit to function at the highest level of efficiency because other necessary chemicals are present with them. As various chemicals are separated or isolated, unbalances, resulting in harmful side effects can occur, defeating the original plan to cleanse and build. Only when we use the best of foods in their original form, are we going to get the most out of them. For many years I have been telling my students that we always need the whole product instead of the various separated units such as carrot juice, vegetable juices, etc. We throw away the pulp \u2014 fiber\u2014 and take only the juice. There are many needed properties in the fiber also to assist in properly handling the juices. Is it not feasible that the lack of them can cause deficiencies or imbalance? We know from excellent results that carrot juice, celery juice and other vegetable juices are excellent but how much better can they be if left intact and taken as is. Can we possibly get as much good and complete nutrition from drinking a dozen carrots without the fiber as we can from properly chewing the whole carrot and eating fewer carrots? Recent findings tell us that fiber \"is that important.\" Formerly we were told not to use fiber as it might cause a variety of colon troubles. In determining this importance and putting it to use should we go over board with the id ea by using such things as wood fiber in bread, (good for termites but not much good for us) or say cereal, or perhaps some other foreign matter in these products or should we use it as it is originally without separating it in the first place. Reminds me of the white bread controversy \u2014 tests showed that white bread could not sustain life even though milk and eggs had been added so a variety of vitamins wee added \u2014 enriched \u2014 fortified flour they called it. Then new standards were found or believed to be nece ssary so more enrichments were added \u2014 then extra iron\u2014 extra spoilage retardants or preservatives appeared necessary ---next extra fiber was found that important. Now after all these things were added just how good was the bread \u2014 taking things out and addin g other things to replace them. Could they be as good as the original ingredients? White bread has always seemed like a sickly looking mess to me. Surely there is a reason for the bulk and other things being there originally. Perhaps they figured God made a mistake so man must correct it. Leaving things as they were originally could have prevented the whole matter. Now if we can accept the whole procedure as a much needed lesson we can then leave the rest of our food as it is and stop taking extra wheat ger m, lecithin, vitamins, minerals, fiber (bran or wood) and many other extras to supplement and enrich a large variety of separated and devitalized products. Another thought by so many people \"If a small amount is good: then logic tells them that a lot can d o so much more\". By taking a lot more isn't it possible that again we might be going overboard and consuming more than the body can handle at one time so we must then work overtime to handle and eliminate the excess or hopelessly clog up the works and defe at our original reason for following the procedures. Then there is the pulp -bulk-which is left out. Something is left out so what deficiencies have we created and what about the following side effects. It seems to me we should start all over again from the beginning: Limit your consumption of food to allow the body to digest and assimilate just the amount it can handle with no excesses. The use of a high protein for weight reducing became a fad and then a predigested protein is creating many serious deficie ncies and developed a monster to the point that it was reported that many have died from lack of potassium, and other needed life qualities. This simple idea can and will save us a lot of time, money and useless research to test for possible deficiencies. Certainly the monetary saving advantages can become a major importance. The ideal purpose of any complete diet is to is to have all the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients in a readily available form in order to enable the body to function normally and to be free from diseases and other malfunctions. Since many people of the world are already handicapped by a multiplicity of diseases, they must first cleanse the body before the right diet can be properly used. Thus, the sick and suffering must first turn to the best of all cleansing diets, THE MASTER CLEANSER AOR LEMONADE DIET. MENU SUGGESTIONS Our system goes through a cleansing process from twelve midnight until twelve noon, and a building program from twelve noon to twelve midnight. Therefore, what is ea ten during these respective periods must be harmonious with the natural processes. The following suggestions take this natural process into account. BREAKFAST: Nothing more is required by the body than fresh lemonade, fresh orange or grapefruit juice. Occ asionally, if one has no desire for even this, try some hot peppermint tea. It gives a clean feeling and is a wonderful tonic. NOON LUNCH: Lunch may be omitted with no ill effects; many will find a small amount of fruit entirely sufficient. If one desires more, a small vegetable or fruit salad may be eaten. Soup (homemade, vegetarian, of course) or tomato juice, hot or cold, may be taken with vegetable salad. Coconut milk or almond milk may be taken with the fruit salad. DINNER (Evening): Simple preparati on of dinner involves starting with a vegetable soup, then having two or three vegetables steamed slightly. On other occasions try special dishes such as vegetable stew, various types of brown rice dishes (curried rice, Spanish rice, chopsuey and rice), ch ili beans (made with lima beans or red beans), or any recipe using lentils or garbanzos \u2014 but no meat, of course. Vegetarian cutlets, and all similar commercially produced meat substitute preparations, should be used very, very sparingly, or not at all. All kinds of berries are an excellent addition for both lunch and dinner. Change your menu daily. Be sure there is plenty of variety from day to day. Do not overeat \u2014 stick to small portions. An occasional mono diet meal is always beneficial such as brown rice with coconut milk and a little maple syrup only steamed artichokes only, fresh green corn only, watermelon, strawberries, and honeydew. Many other single items can readily come to mind. The accepted idea of five necessary categories of foods daily is quit e faulty. It is very time consuming, costly and does not accomplish the desired results that simplification can. Different types of foods have different requirement in time and abilities to properly digest them. Too many combinations often cause a variety of digestive disturbances. COCONUT MILK Coconut milk may be used in all recipes calling for milk. Other nut milks are also good. They are superior and preferred to the use of any of the animal milks. Use fresh nuts in preference to canned or grated nuts. To prepare coconut milk, start with blender \u00bd full of warm water. Add 2 tablespoons of maple syrup and a dash of salt. (These two ingredients may be left out if not desired.) As blender is running (medium to high speed) add chunks of coconut until containe r is nearly full. (Dried coconut may be used.) Strain the pulp from the liquid and use the pulp over again by adding fresh warm water to it in the blender. Strain again, and throw the used pulp away. The coconut milk produced in this fashion makes a tasty, nutritious beverage for children or adults in place of animal milk. Blending coconut milk and your favorite fresh fruit together can make a number of delicious drinks. COCONUT -SESAME MIX (May be used for many cream sauces.) 6 tablespoons grated coconut 6 tablespoons fresh sesame seeds Sesame or safflower oil Blend the two dry ingredients until they no longer fall to center. Stop the blender and push them to the center with a knife several times as they stick to the sides. As blender is running add sesame or safflower oil until the oil covers the pulp (approx. 6 tablespoons). Blend for 2 minutes and then add warm water until mixture reaches the desired thickness (approx. 12 oz. of water). One tablespoon of maple syrup and a dash of salt may be added if desi red. FOR SAUCES: Start with coconut milk, or coconut -sesame milk; add potato flour for thickening and season with desired spices. May also be used for creamed soups (mushroom, celery, etc.)) and scalloped dishes (potato, cauliflower, etc.) Try variations as your imagination dictates. ALMOND MILK Start with 1 lb. of shelled almonds (dry) in the blender. Blend until they no longer fall to the center. Push them to the center with a knife several times as they stick to the side as the blender is running. Add sesame or safflower oil until pulp is covered (approximately 7 tablespoons.) Blend for 2 minutes more and then add warm water until mixture is desired thickness. Two to three glasses of water should be sufficient. One or two tablespoons of maple syrup and a dash of salt may be added if desired. This makes a nice drink or may be used for any milk recipe. MAYONNAISE Start with the coconut -sesame milk, but keep it medium thick by using less than the customary water. Add the following: 5 tablespoons apple cide r vinegar 1-tablespoon maple syrup 2 cloves garlic 1-teaspoon paprika 1-teaspoon chili powder 1 teaspoon powdered mustard 1-teaspoon turmeric \u00bd teaspoon sweet basil Salt to taste VEGETABLE SALAD DRESSING NO 1 Using preceding mayonnaise dressing to start a dd extra spices, delicately, such as dill seed, curry powder, cayenne pepper, fennel seed, or oregano. A couple of dill pickles and sweet relish may be added to provide the Thousand Island taste. VEGETABLE SALAD DRESSING NO. 2 \u00be cup olive, sesame, or saff lower oil \u00bd cup vinegar (apple cider or wine) 2 tablespoons lemon or limejuice 3 tablespoons maple syrup \u00bd teaspoon paprika 2 teaspoons mustard 1-teaspoon sweet basil 1-teaspoon dill seed \u00bd teaspoon cardamom 2 cloves garlic 2 tablespoons potato flour (opti onal) Blend the oil and vinegar together first with the maple syrup, then add the other ingredients. Add the potato flour as needed if you desire the dressing to be thicker and creamier.
