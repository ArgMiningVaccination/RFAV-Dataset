It is then that you notice your head, pounding out a drumbeat faster than the one you danced to late last night. You know you have got a hangover - thanks to an overabundance of spirits, rich food or frenzied activity - but what can you do about it besides taking the old standbys of aspirin and caffeine? Ideally, you would plan to take a day off to stay in bed and recover, because most hangovers run their course in 24 hours. At the very least a nap would be helpful. But in the far-from-ideal situations in which hangovers find many people, the next morning and its accompanying responsibilities arrive all too quickly. Hangover veterans usually have their favorite cures. They range from swallowing aspirin while drinking alcohol to the infamous hair- of-the-dog solution, which means you drink more alcohol in the morning to ease the hangover. Both solutions make hangovers more intense and cause them to last longer. If you must focus on the day ahead instead of your pounding head, here are some natural suggestions that go beyond over-the-counter drugs. Because alcohol is a powerful diuretic, drinking enough water during and immediately after a night of merrymaking can have a significant effect on how you will feel the next day. Start downing water before you go out, and keep it up throughout the evening and whenever you wake up during the night. Hangover symptoms are your liver's efforts to process alcohol; the more liquid you have, the more efficiently your liver operates. Coffee may seem more appealing the morning after, but it will end up having exactly the opposite effect of good old refreshing water. All coffee really does for a hangover is leave you miserable and wired. After an initial burst of energy, caffeine makes the fatigue and upset stomach even worse. Along with water, try an herbal tea, such as mint, before going to bed. Michael Castleman, author of The Healing Herb (Rodale, 1992) and co-author of Before You Call the Doctor (Ballantine, 1993), says the source of peppermint's healing properties is the menthol contained in the herb. Menthol may relax the smooth muscle lining of the digestive tract, acting as an anti-spasmodic and easing digestive disorders. Chamomile is another good herb for tea, says Castleman, because of the sedative properties of its oil. Another boom for hangover sufferers: The chemical that makes up 50 percent of chamomile oil, bisbolol, is also an anti-spasmodic. Eat carbohydrates the next day - if you think you can eat at all. \"Something like cereal and nonacidic juice is good,\" says Dr. Ed Blonz, a nutritionist. Not only is such food bland and light (perfect for an overworked stomach), itwill also help keep your body fueled as the liver attempts to rid itself of excess alcohol. Can't I just take some vitamins to make me feel better? you ask. Just as there is no drug that eliminates a hangover, there is no research that shows vitamin supplements will reduce the symptoms or duration of a hangover. Castleman says, \"Some studies suggest that regular vitamin C supplementation may help by increasing the rate of alcohol breakdown in the body.\" However, no significant studies have been done to test this claim. Blonz believes the best remedy is time. Theoretically, he says, extra vitamins - such as C and the B vitamins, in particular - might help your body rid itself sooner of the effects of alcohol. But it is more likely, he says, that taking megadoses of vitamin C while fighting a hangover would only result in overstressed kidneys. In addition to drinking fluids, eating small meals and perhaps taking specific vitamin supplements, there are other suggestions: Homeopathy: This is a gentle, 150-year-old treatment based on the idea that substances taken in large doses produce a certain set of unwanted symptoms, but taken in microdoses cure a sick person with those same symptoms. Homeopathic remedies are prepared from mineral, plant and animal extracts in minute doses. (Check the labels to see which products are plant-based.) They are used to stimulate your natural immunological defenses. Dana Ullman, director of the Foundation for Homeopathic Education and Research in Oakland, Calif., says a good idea for hangover sufferers is to look for homeopathic formulas available in natural-food stores. These products are usually geared toward treating specific symptoms. Choose the proper formula for your most pressing complaint - if your head is pounding, choose the headache formulation; if you're feeling sick to your stomach, choose the nausea formulation. Ullman cautions against mixing two or more formulas, because one may be the antidote for the other, thus wiping out any potentially helpful effects. Ice it: To help that pounding feeling in your head, apply an ice pack for 20 minutes, take it off for 10, then repeat. Aromatherapy: Mindy Green, an herbalist-aromatherapist and director of the California School of Herbal Studies in Forestville, Calif., recommends drinking two ounces of rose water before going to bed and again the next morning; the astringent properties of the rose water strengthen and cleanse the liver, she says. You can find rose water at Indian markets or some natural food stores. Just make sure it is a pure product, distilled only from rose petals and without any additives. Don't confuse it with rose oil, which is also used in aromatherapy but is very concentrated and should not be taken internally. Chinese medicine: A hangover would have to be pretty terrible to warrant acupuncture (the insertion of hair-thin needles at certain bioelectric pathways throughout the body), although it can be used to treat specific hangover symptoms like nausea or cotton mouth. In 15 years of practice, Bob Flaws, president of the Acupuncture Association of Colorado, has never had a client come in only for hangover complaints. However, he also recommends tea to relieve some hangover symptoms. Make a tea of equal parts kudzu root, umeboshi plum and fresh ginger root. These ingredients, all available at health-food stores, have an anti-spasmodic effect on the smooth muscle lining of the stomach and are helpful for nausea. "}
