It harnesses the knowledge of health-preservation from over eighty generations of practitioners, and distinguishes itself among traditional holistic and conventional regimens with several millennia of clinical experience handed down from practitioner to practitioner, originally in China, and now all over the world. Utilizing an understanding of the movement of electromagnetic energy, or Qi, (pronounced \"chee\") throughout the body and mind, acupuncture is used today to treat a variety of symptoms, acute and chronic, as well as nonspecific and undiagnosed ailments. At Eugene Holistic Medicine, we focus on restoring harmony to the body, mind, and spirit to promote pain relief for adults and children, and to balance hormones to enhance fertility. Through the insertion of fine, sterile, one-time-use needles, the body's own healing response is stimulated, in turn helping to restore its natural balance. Theory of Traditional East Asian Medicine The Western doctor observes the facts before him and uses current physiological theories to explain the cause and effect of disease patterns. Chinese medicine is based on a much wider world view, which has its roots in philosophy and nature. The Taoist concept of health is to attain a harmony between the opposing forces of the natural world, Yin and Yang. There has been extensive research done in both China and the West on just how it is that acupuncture works, and it is clear that acupuncture has a measurable effect on the autonomic nervous system, on vascular and endocrine physiology, brain chemistry and specifically on the production of endorphins, which is why it is so frequently used in the treatment of all types of pain. 'Day gives way to night, night to day; a time of light and activity (Yang) is followed by darkness and rest (Yin). Flowers open and close, the moon waxes and wanes, the tides come in and go out; we wake and sleep, breathe in, breathe out. Yin/Yang is a constant, continual flow through which everything is expressed on the one hand and recharged on the other. They are an inseparable couple. Their proper relationship is health; a disturbance in this relationship is disease.'
