It destroys relationships with family and friends. Taking the first step toward sobriety can be very difficult, especially when you do not know what to expect. Holistic treatment that focuses on healing the mind, body, and spirit is important for a healthy and full recovery. Activities promoting health and well-being will help with your healing process. Eric Patterson, MSCP, NCC, LPC wrote about holistic therapy for DrugAbuse.com. He explained, \"Services provided in a holistic rehab derive from holistic or integrative medicine, and are utilized to achieve optimal wellness by focusing on the concept of a unified mind-body-spirit; with goals for treating the \"whole person\" and not just the individual symptoms of the addiction or alcoholism.\" Recovery from addiction not only helps your body, but also clears your mind. Addiction is an illness that changes the way your brain controls your body's functions and chemistry and creates an emotional dependence. Effective treatment teaches the brain to live without toxins. In rehab, you will learn to cope with stress, anxiety, and depression without the use of drugs or alcohol. Exploring fun, healthy activities will help occupy your mind, distract you from using, and promote wellness. Healthy activities such as yoga, meditation, and exercise help clear your mind to concentrate on recovery. Staying away from substances can be very difficult because your body is accustomed to living with the substances you once used. Intense cravings and physical withdrawals make living substance-free more complicated. In treatment, your body will go through significant changes. Many counselors and staff are recovering from addiction themselves and understand these challenges. They are passionate about helping you and want to see you successfully recover. Addiction robs your self-worth and ability to connect with others. It beats you down mentally, physically and spiritually. Holistic treatment helps you discover more about yourself, restores your faith, and renews your spirit. Treatment will help you look inward and identify your strengths and self-awareness. Recovery restores your spirit and gives you the confidence, encouragement, and sense of self that you lost with addiction. Holistic treatment is a life-saving opportunity designed to heal your mind, body, and spirit. Cypress Lakes Lodge uses a holistic approach to recovery, which is integrated into a nurturing lifestyle.
