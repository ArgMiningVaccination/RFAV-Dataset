The current application claims a priority to the U.S. Provisional Patent application Ser. No. 62/727,661 filed on Sep. 6, 2018.FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to therapy exercises in energy medicine and energy psychology. More specifically, the present invention relates to a self-directed therapy exercise that heals the mind, body and spirit through a series of self-directed therapy/healing exercises, which combines the most effective therapy modalities, and a plurality of prayers to release stress and any negative/unhealthy issues.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In present times, many individuals are torn between juggling heavy workloads, managing relationships and family responsibilities, and squeezing in outside interests, it is no surprise that more than one in four Americans describe themselves as \"super stressed\" according to an article titled \"Mental Health America\" by Mental Health America (MHA). \"Stress can zap our concentration, make us irritable or depressed, and harm our personal and professional relationships. Over time, stress also weakens our immune systems, and makes us susceptible to a variety of ailments from colds to backaches to heart disease. The newest research shows that chronic stress can actually double our risk of having a heart attack. Not only is achieving a healthy work/life balance an attainable goal but workers and businesses alike see the rewards.\" Thus, people are always looking for ways to cope with stress and negative emotions/traits/behaviors. In conventional systems of energy medicine and energy healing therapy, licensed practitioners are often hired by the individuals, resulting in professional, but costly methods of dealing with stress, and negative emotions/traits/behaviors. In the field of energy medicine and energy psychology, energy, in the form of Chi, Ki, Qi, Prana, Force, is all around us. All living entities\u2014birds, flowers, trees and human beings\u2014are manifestations of energy. Living in a world of energy, people have been tapping on the various energy healing modalities to heal human beings and others for the past thousands of years. In the ancient Egypt, people acquired the knowledge to harness cosmic energy through the pyramids for many purposes including healing. Further, there were many shamans, or energy healers, who were able to heal people through laying of hands, according to an article titled \"10 Types of Energy Healing Modalities\" by lotus-happiness.com. \"All healings are self-healing. Our bodies are endowed with extraordinary abilities to heal ourselves. We are energy and hence it is possible to perform healing for ourselves as well as others.\" Energy healing modalities, such as Quantum Touch\u00ae, EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques\u00ae), Reiki, acupuncture, yoga, tai chi, etc., are alternative medical therapies based on the movement of energy in the body. Traditionally, there are thousands of modalities, every one of them, however, normally addresses one thing of a human being, such as a physical body part, a mental illness, a specific psychological problem, etc. Many modalities may be great for the physical body but lack the capability to deal with mental and/or spiritual issues of a user. Other modalities may be great for addressing mental issues such as the user's conscious thoughts, feelings, emotions, actions, but do not address the physical and/or spiritual issues the use may have at the same time. Numerous individuals have frustratingly tried one thing after another to look for a whole healing solution to their problems that relate to their physical, mental and spiritual well-being. Generally speaking, there is no modality existed that can address everything of a human being, which consists of body, mind, and spirit. The present invention, Trilogy, addresses everything of a human being: body, mind, spirit, and in particular, addresses acupuncture points, meridians, memories, brain functioning, governing and conception vessel\u2014the river of energy that flows the user's body, chakras and energy centers, prayer and meditation, etc. Trilogy is a unique process of energy healing that combines the world's top modalities into a single, powerful process and structures them so that they complement and empower one another. Each component addresses the body, mind, or spirit in a different combination, so that when used together, they deliver powerful healing to any problem, regardless of the source. Specifically, the trilogy method addresses four aspects of a human being through energy healing therapy. Firstly, the trilogy method addresses the physical and mental by making use of acupuncture points and meridians. This is the top energy modality in the world, commonly used in well-known practices such as acupuncture, TFT (Thought Field Therapy) and EFT. Secondly, the trilogy method addresses the mental and spiritual, using the Healing Code points to address harmful and wrong beliefs in your memories. The Healing Code points were discovered by Dr. Alexander Loyd and are the second most used energy modality in the world. Thirdly, the trilogy method addresses the spiritual and physical by making use of governing and conception vessels as well as chakra energy centers. Fourthly, the trilogy method addresses the physical, mental and spiritual through meditation, prayer and truth-focused statements. Overall, the trilogy process of the present invention aims to provide a self-directed approach to cope with stress and negative emotions/traits/behaviors. Specifically, the present invention allows the user to perform quick, easy and effective self-directed exercises that heal the mind, body, and spirit. Additionally, the present invention comprises additional steps that further supplements the aforementioned process. Furthermore, the present invention can be supplemented with the usage of audio, visual devices and recordings to aid in accelerating and enhancing the healing process of the trilogy method of the present invention.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Trilogy provides a method and process of self-directed energy healing of mind, body, and spirit of a user to release stress and negative issues.
