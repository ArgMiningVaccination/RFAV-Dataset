Eric's research is focused on solving mineral resource problems through the theory and application of geophysical methods. He integrates geophysical data with geology and mineral deposit models to understand the three-dimensional geologic framework within which ore deposits occur. He works mostly in the western US on mineral deposits that form in convergent margin settings.

IHNV causes severe epidemics in young fish and can cause disease or occur asymptomatically in adults.

Anderson [Protection of rainbow trout against infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus four days after specific or semi-specific DNA vaccination](/publications/protection-rainbow-trout-against-infectious-hematopoietic-necrosis-virus-four-days)A DNA vaccine against a fish rhabdovirus, infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), was shown to provide significant protection as soon as 4 d after intramuscular vaccination in 2 g rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) held at 15\u00b0C. Nearly complete protection was also observed at later time points (7, 14, and 28 d) using a standardized waterborne challenge model. In a test of the specificityAuthorsS. E. LaPatra, S. Corbeil, G.

LaPatra [Nanogram quantities of a DNA vaccine protect rainbow trout fry against heterologous strains of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus](/publications/nanogram-quantities-a-dna-vaccine-protect-rainbow-trout-fry-against-heterologous)The efficacy of a DNA vaccine containing the glycoprotein gene of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), a rhabdovirus affecting trout and salmon, was investigated. The minimal dose of vaccine required, the protection against heterologous strains, and the titers of neutralizing antibodies produced were used to evaluate the potential of the vaccine as a control pharmaceutical.
