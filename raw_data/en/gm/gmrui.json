Several Covid-19 vaccines have received [emergency use authorisation in multiple countries](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/01/03/india-approves-oxford-local-coronavirus-vaccines-emergency-use/), and almost all countries, including US and China, have committed to participate in the COVAX Facility, the vaccine pillar of the ACT Accelerator. It is on track to distribute at least two billion doses by the end of 2021, including at least 1.3 billion doses to 92 lower income economies in the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment. Co-convened by nine of the world's leading health organisations, including the WHO, [the ACT Accelerator's goal](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/global-pandemic-requires-world-effort-end-none-us-will-safe/) is to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to Covid-19 tests, treatments, vaccines and the health systems that support them. ACT Accelerator is [the world's best shot at ending the acute phase of the pandemic](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/vaccines-great-new-global-solidarity-way-pandemic/) as quickly as possible. But if developing vaccines within 12 months was an unprecedented challenge that public and private actors jointly have astoundingly overcome, getting vaccines to almost eight billion people is perhaps an even greater hurdle. Strong determination and out-of-the-box thinking are required. But as the virus accelerates and new variants emerge, suppressing its spread has never been more urgent. Manufacturing and distribution problems [are already causing supply constraints](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/01/13/merkel-admits-vaccine-shortage-amid-slow-roll-out-across-europe/). Moreover, COVAX has yet to receive the full amount of funding required. As Co-Chair of the Facilitation Council of the ACT Accelerator with South Africa, Norway is committed to ensure it can achieve its goals. Here are four pragmatic principles for pharmaceutical company action in 2021 that will help. 1. File for registration rapidly, widely and on the basis of the most rigorous standards Vaccines can be made widely available in countries only when filed for registration and authorised by national health authorities supported by an Emergency Use Listing from the World Health Organization (WHO). These processes are important to secure one global quality standard for all people. Norway calls on pharma companies to expand their regulatory capacity and file for registration as quickly and as widely as possible after approval by FDA or EMA. Companies should work collaboratively with WHO on the Emergency Use Listing (EUL) Procedure. This is particularly vital as COVAX can only distribute vaccines that have received an EUL. The 2021 Access to Medicine Index finds that more pharma companies are thinking ahead about availability and affordability as soon as R&D projects reach late-stage clinical development. Most of these access plans focus on filing for registration in specific LMICs. The Index also shows that companies have capacity to prioritise LMICs, when willing to do so. 2. Price products equitably Covid-19 is devastating economies around the world. Vaccines should be one of the tools for returning to normal economic activity, not an additional burden on the finances of lower income countries. According to a [new report by the ICC](https://iccwbo.org/publication/the-economic-case-for-global-vaccinations/), the global economy stands to lose as much as $9.2 trillion in the absence of multilateral coordination that guarantees vaccine access and distribution. Norway calls on pharma companies to implement pricing strategies that take countries' different levels of ability to pay into account. Companies should agree cost plus prices with the COVAX Facility for the 92 Advanced Market Commitment eligible countries. Other companies should make similar commitments and maintain the same terms for access for all lower income economies. All companies should ensure that any equitable pricing strategies outside of scope of COVAX negotiations do not leave those living in LICs behind. 3. Expand production and supply capacity Norway is calling on pharma companies to think differently and implement all possible strategies to increase manufacturing capacity. Technology transfers and voluntary licensing play key roles when in-house or contract manufacturing cannot meet external demand. The pharma industry should follow examples of peers like AstraZeneca, Novavax and Johnson & Johnson who agreed to tech transfers and voluntary licensing agreements with vaccine manufacturers based in LMICs like Serum Institute of India and Aspen, and consider the use of even wider non-exclusive voluntary licenses. 4. Disclose more information about efforts and progress against these principles More transparency from the industry would enable governments and global health organisations to respond to company efforts and coordinate the global financing and distribution system better. Global procurers need to have more information about the number of doses ordered, the price and projected delivery capacities. We just need to look to Eisai's donation programme in the field of neglected tropical diseases to see where this has been done before. We hope companies voluntarily and based on both their own and societal long-term interests will take guidance from these four principles. There is a global moral imperative to work collaboratively to improve expedited access to Covid-19 tests, treatments and vaccines, across countries of all income levels to prevent as many deaths as possible and restart economies. This is in the best interest of rich countries and multinational companies as well as populations living in less resourced settings. Innovative, efficient, and transparent partnerships will lead to better control of the pandemic and help prevent the negative impact of new virus variants that risk the incredible progress made to date on vaccine R&D. - Dag-Inge Ulstein is Norway's Minister of International Development and Professor John-Arne R\u00f8ttingen is Ambassador for Global Health at the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Protect yourself and your family by learning more about "}
