The purpose was to provide practical guidelines for the management of children with blood disorders and cancer. In particular, the authors use standards of care currently established for the paediatric haematology-oncology program at Princess Marina Hospital (Botswana) through a partnership with Baylor College of Medicine and the Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers. Thus, portions of this handbook may not be applicable to every clinical setting and appropriate alternatives, excluded from this handbook, may be available in other settings. Every effort has been exerted to ensure that the content contained in this handout is in accordance with current recommendations and practice at the time of this publication. However, the user is urged to use best clinical judgment in applying the information contained in this handbook, especially medication dosages and intervals, based on each patient's unique clinical status and the medical setting. The user is advised to cross check the information contained in this handbook with published reference materials. Haematology 1. Blood Transfusion Therapy Infection Risk of Blood Transfusion Estimates Incidence estimates taken from Transfusion 2002; platelet units General Guidelines for Transfusion Therapy Prior to initial transfusion, consider HIV & Hepatitis B & C screening. Premedication: Used in patients with a history of prior allergic or febrile transfusion reaction oOne or more of these medications can be used: Paracetamol 15 mg/kg PO (Max dose 650 mg/dose) Antihistamine (give one of the following): Chlorpheniramine (Allergex) - 1 mg (2-5 years), 2 mg (6-11 years), 4 mg (>12 years) PO Promethazine 1 mg/kg/dose (for children 25 mg is usually sufficient although up to 50 mg can be given) PO/IV Hydrocortisone 2 mg/kg IV (Max dose 250mg/dose) Or alternative steroid such as dexamethasone, prednisone, or methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) Packed Red Blood Cell (pRBC) Transfusion Give pRBC transfusion if Hgb < 7 g/dL for most patients, especially acute anaemia, or if there are signs of cardiovascular compromise An exception to the above would be if the etiology of anemia is from iron deficiency. If the Hgb < 7 g/dL with the likely cause iron deficiency (low MCV, low reticulocyte count, high RDW, microcytic and hypochromic RBCs on peripheral blood smear) and the child is asymptomatic, oral iron therapy can be started with ferrous sulfate 3 mg/kg/dose twice a day with close monitoring in lieu of a pRBC transfusion. If oral iron is not possible, see Appendix O for a protocol for IM iron therapy. Transfuse 10-15 mL/kg pRBC IV over 2-4 hours oResponse varies depending on concentration of unit, but expect 1g/dL rise in haemoglobin for each 5 mL/kg transfusion givenPaediatric Haematology/Oncology Ward hyperleukocytosis (WBC >100,000) should Diuretic Therapy: oFurosemide isnot routinely recommended and should be given only if the clinical condition warrants it (i.e. cardiac dysfunction or respiratory/0 2issues) Platelet Transfusion Dosing of transfusion volume: oTransfuse 10 if single donor platelets available or one 50mL pack/10kg if random donor platelet packs available (to a max of 4-6 packs) oTransfuse over 1 hour Expect increase in platelet count by 50,000/mm3with above guidelines If there is concern for poor response check platelet count from 60 minutes post- transfusion to assess response CAUTIONS! oContraindicated in patients with Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) oNo benefit in patients with Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) unless there is life-threatening bleeding , but should be only given after a bolus dose of steroids (methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg IV, max 1g/dose) and/or IVIG (0.8 g/kg IV). Refer to ITP section for further management. Platelet count ( /mm3) Transfusion Strategy < 10,000 High risk for bleeding; transfusion likely indi- cated except in ITP without life-threatening bleeding (see ITP section) Do not perform surgery, lumbar puncture (LP) or intramuscular (IM) injection . 10,000 -20,000 Transfusion likely needed if patient has infec- tion, coagulopathy, splenomegaly, or bleeding. Do not perform surgery, LP or IM injection . 20,000 -50,000 Transfusion for active bleeding, patients with brain tumor, or for invasive procedures (LP, central line placement). Stable patients rarely ever require transfusion. > 50,000 Transfusion only if there is an underlying plate- let dysfunction or there is significant bleeding. Plasma Transfusion Indications for Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) use: oMassive transfusion of pRBC (e.g. greater than patient's total blood volume within 24 hours) oActive bleeding or surgery in patient with prolonged Prothrombin Time (PT) and/or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) secondary to factor deficiency for which specific factor replacement is not available oDisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with bleeding oHaemophilia A or B without the appropriate factor concentrate available Dosing of Plasma oGive 15mL/kg oFFP contains 1 unit/mL of coagulation factors 10-15 mL/kg will result in 25-50% rise in factor level Factor V & Factor VII may be exceptions as the former is labile & the latter has a short half-life oIf patient is actively bleeding and the FFP arrives frozen you may thaw more quickly in a bowl of warm, ideally sterile, water oDried human plasma stored at room temperature (like Bioplasma FDP) is also an option Cryoprecipitate Indications: obleeding or invasive procedure with factor VIII deficiency or von Willebrand disease and factor concentrate not available oBleeding or invasive procedure with hypofibrinogenaemia or factor XIII deficiency oDoes not contain Factor IX so not appropriate as replacement for Haemophilia B treatment Dosing: oGive 1 unit/5 kg IV over 1 hour every 8-24 hours 2. Transfusion Reactions Signs & Symptoms of Transfusion Reactions Can include any or all of the following therefore it is important to monitor for these every 20 minutes during a transfusion: oChills & fever (>38.0\u00b0C) (hypotension, delayed capillary refill, mental status changes) Management of Transfusion Reaction Stop transfusion, change IV tubing, flush line & start normal saline (NS) at 1600 mL/m2/day (maintenance rate) If febrile or urticarial reaction give: oParacetamol mg/kg PO (Max dose 650 oHydrocortisone 2 mg/kg IV (Max dose 250 mg/dose) Note: if unavailable, then may use another steroid such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone oAntihistamine (give one of the following): Chlorpheniramine (Allergex) 1 mg (2-5 years), 2 mg (6-11 years), 4 mg (>12 years) PO Promethazine 1 mg/kg/dose (for children 25 mg is usually sufficient though up to 50mg can be given) PO/IV In patients with anaphylaxis adrenaline should be 0.01 mL/kg IV/IO Max single dose is 0.1 mg/dose Management per anaphylaxis by PediatricPaediatric Haematology/Oncology Handbook \u00a9 Baylor College of Medicine 2015 6Advanced Life Support (PALS) For any reaction monitor vital signs every 2-5 minutes until patient is stable including heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, & pulse oximetry (where available) Once patient is stable, consider transfusion of additional products unless patient experienced haemolytic reaction, in such a case, discuss with paediatric haematologist-oncologist first. Patients with a history of transfusion reactions can be given pre-medication with chlorpheniramine (Allergex)/promethazine, paracetamol, and/or hydrocortisone. Doses noted above. If patient experiences only mild urticaria, give chlorpheniramine (Allergex) and/or promethazine; if symptoms resolve, continue transfusion slowly over no more than 4 hours. 3. Sickle Cell Disease (See Appendix C for haemoglobinopathy roadmap ) Penicillin Prophylaxis: Patients should be receiving penicillin (PCN) prophylaxis Penicillin VK 125 mg PO twice daily for age birth - 2 years Penicillin VK 250 mg PO twice daily for > 3 years Can substitute amoxicillin if PCN unavailable Discontinuing PCN prophylaxis can be considered for patients age 5 years & older who meet BOTH of these criteria: Patient without prior history of documented pneumococcal infection Patients who have received 1 dose of PPSV23 (pneumococcal 23) and appropriate PCV13 doses. Diagnostics: Ideally, haemoglobin (Hgb) electrophoresis should be sent after 6-12 months of age as long as there has not been an RBC transfusion in the previous 3 months. Folic Acid Supplementation: Patients with chronic haemolysis, as with sickle cell disease, benefit from folic acid supplementation: For ALL sickle cell patients give: o0.5 mg PO daily (age < 2 years age) o1 mg PO daily (age > 2 years age) In the resource-limited setting, folic acid is often only available as 5 mg tablets, in this case, give 5 mg for age > 2 years as folate is relatively benign 5 mg tablet can be crushed into a suspension made for infants: o5 mg folic acid in 10 mL liquid (1 mL equals 0.5 mg folic acid) Hydroxyurea : Mechanism: increases fetal haemoglobin Indications: frequent vaso-occlusive episodes, acute chest syndrome, chronic hypoxia, low Hgb F, history of stroke, & signs of haemolysis Consult with paediatric haematologist-oncologist for appropriate work-up before initiating a patient on hydroxyurea 3A. Sickle with FeverPaediatric Haematology/Oncology bacteria) S. pneumoniae H. Full blood count with differential & reticulocyte count Type and cross match Total bilirubin and/or LDH Blood culture CXR When clinically indicated - blood chemistries, urinalysis, urine culture, lumbar puncture Management/Treatment Admit for intravenous antibiotics if anyof the following is found: oAge < 1 year oT > 40oC oAny infiltrate on < on room air oHistory bacteremia or pneumonia oHgb < 6 g/dL oStart coverage for 7-10 mg/kg/DAY divided every 6-8 hours Infants and 1 month to 12 years (<50 kg): 33-75 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours Meningitis: 75 hours (maximum: 2 gram/dose or 12 gram/DAY) Children >12 years (50 kg) and Adults: Moderate to severe infection: 1-2 gram every 6-8 hours infection: 2 Add: oVancomycin 10-15 mg/kg/dose IV every 8 hour with chest divided Q6 hours (max 2g/day) oAzithromycin can be used where available Patients who do not require admission: oMinimum phone follow-up within 24 hours to check culture results & clinical condition then consider one of the following: Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV/IM x 1 prior to discharge Augmentin 80-90mg/kg/day divided twice daily PO for 10 days Erythromycin 50 mg/kg/day divided 4 times daily for 3 days for patients al- lergic to cephalosporin (Max 4g per day oral) If blood culture positive , then adjust treatment based on culture & sensitivity. 3B. Sickle Cell Vaso-occlusive Crisis Pain crisis Diagnostics oFull blood count with differential & reticulocyte count (anaemia and reticulocytosis typical) oPeripheral blood smear: sickled red blood haemolysis) Management oPain control with opioid analgesic (see Pain Control section) oHydration: 2000 mL/m2/day (1.25x maintenance IV + PO intake) if no cardiopulmonary compromise oRest and heat to the area of pain; avoid cold as this can worsen pain oRemember patients with SSD are also at increased risk for avascular necrosis of the femoral and humeral head oAlso remember dactylitis is painful swelling in the hands and feet and common in children <5 years Priapism Definition: painful erection lasting >30 min Diagnostics oFull blood count with differential & reticulocyte count Management oPain control with opioid analgesics (see Pain Control section) oHydration: 2000 mL/m2/day (1.25x maintenance) if no cardiopulmonary compromise oConsult urology immediately for aspiration & irrigation if 4 hours since onset oTransfusion only if no detumescence within 12 hours oThere is no indication for oxygen therapy in such cases Splenic sequestration Splenic pooling of large amounts of blood and platelets Diagnostics oFull blood count with differential & reticulocyte countPaediatric Haematology/Oncology Handbook \u00a9 & Management oHydration: 1600 mL/m2/day (maintenance rate) oTransfusion with pRBC urgently with goal back to baseline Hgb Generally transfuse with 5 mL/kg as patient at risk of auto-transfusion (sequestered blood leaving the spleen) oAvoid aggressive splenic palpation prevent splenic rupture oConsider splenectomy to prevent Aplastic crisis Severe anaemia primarily caused by parvovirus B19 or other virus Diagnostics oFull blood count with differential & reticulocyte count oType & cross Management oHydration: maintenance PO fluids (rate as above) or IV fluids if not able to take PO oTransfusion with pRBC as clinically indicated if symptomatic or if Hgb falls 2 g/dL or more from baseline Acute Chest Syndrome/Pneumonia Diagnostics oFull blood count with differential & reticulocyte lateral Note: 60% of children with acute chest syndrome will have an infiltrate on CXR but a normal pulmonary exam Management oHydration: IV fluids at \u00be maintenance maximum depending on oral intake. Can decrease or discontinue IV fluids if taking enough PO fluids to meet daily maintenance goal (1600 mL/m2/day). Over-hydration can lead to pulmonary oedema and worsen acute chest syndrome oPain management: Be cautious with narcotics but do not withhold. Balance between pain control & sedation as either may lead to respiratory distress. Narcotics can lead to hypoventilation and worsen acute chest syndrome. oRespiratory care: Oxygen therapy with pulse oximetry monitoring Salbutamol inhaler/nebulized every 4 hours Incentive spirometry 10 puffs every 2 hours while awake (may also have the child blow bubbles or a pin wheel). Ambulation encouraged. opRBC: 10-15 mL/kg Hgb drops <2g/dL from baseline), significant hypoxia, or worsening respiratory status See Section 3D regarding risk of over-transfusion oExchange transfusion may be considered; however it is rarely available in resource-limited setting oAntibiotics for pneumonia: Cefotaxime + Vancomycin + Haematology/Oncology Ward Officer's Handbook Baylor College of 10-Management and Treatment ) Stroke Occurs in 10-15% of children with sickle cell disease Diagnostics oFull blood count with differential & reticulocyte count oType & cross oQuantitative D-dimer if available oEmergent CT or MRI/MRA (where available) Contrast may exacerbate sickling. Discuss using contrast with paediatric haematologist-oncologist on call. Management oExchange transfusion is standard management where available oIf not available, simple transfusion can be considered. See Section 8 \"Thrombosis\" for more. 3C. Pre-operative Preparation of Sickle Cell Patients Diagnostics Full blood count Type & cross Patients ought to receive simple transfusions to reduce Hgb S and to achieve Hgb of 10 g/dL Hydration IV + PO = 1.25 x maintenance the night before surgery 3D. Transfusion Therapy in Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell patients should not be transfused to Hgb > 10 g/dL or Hct > 30% as this results in increased risk for stroke & vaso-occlusion Where available, full RBC phenotyping should be performed prior to initial transfusion and routine extended matching for minor RBC antigens, such as Rh and Kell, is recommended prior to all subsequent transfusions 4. Epistaxis Management Epistaxis Management Place patient ideally in the sitting position . Do not let the child lie down flat and ensure the head is above the heart. Flex neck anteriorly with chin touching the chest With thumb and index finger pinch the soft parts of the nose on the lower halfof the nose and hold pressure for 20 minutes continuously to allow for clot formation to occur Advise the patient to not blow their nose for at least 12 hours Nasal packing may be placed if source of bleeding not well visualized or bleeding is profuse Transfuse platelets if platelet count < 50,000 5. Haemophilia Most common is Haemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency) and Haemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) o80% with A and 20% with haemophilia B oX-linked recessive, 30% are de novo with no family history Diagnostic Testing oProlonged PTT with a normal PT and normal suggestivePaediatric Haematology/Oncology Ward Officer's Handbook \u00a9 of Medicine 11oConfirm with a factor VIII or Factor IX level: Severity Factor Level Severe <1% Moderate 1-4% Mild 5-25% *Note : normal factor level ranges from 50-200% In children <5 years, it is recommended to give weekly factor prophylaxis to prevent bleeds as they are at high risk for injury. May also do this for older patients if they are having frequent bleeding. Haemophilia A: 50 units/kg every week or more often depending on the clinical situation Haemophilia B: 100 units/kg every week or more often depending on the clinical situation oInhibitor Screen Where available, screening for inhibitor should be performed: Mixing Study is a qualitative inhibitor screen Bethesda assay is the gold standard If screen positive, defined as > 5 Bethesda Units, recombinant and concentrate products will not be sufficient even at high doses oWhere available Factor VIIa, Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Complex, Factor IX Complex Concentrate or Porcine Factor VIII should be considered TREATMENT OF BLEEDING IN HAEMOPHILIA (See also APPENDICES D & E ) Patients with haemophilia can have spontaneous bleeding and/or excessive bleeding with trauma, it is imperative to treat haemophilia patients with factor within 30 minutes of presentation first and then consider diagnostic testing. oFACTOR REPLACEMENT Factor VIII deficiency (Haemophilia A) 1 unit/kg increases Factor VIII activity by 2% Give 30 units/kg of factor VIII for an acute mild bleed Give 50 units/kg of factor VIII for an acute major bleed After initial dose, discuss treatment plan with paediatric haematologist-oncologist. Half-life of factor VIII is 8-12 hours. Major bleed will likely need q 8-12 hour dosing. Factor IX deficiency (Haemophilia B) 1 unit/kg increases Factor IX activity by 1% Give 50 units/kg of factor IX for an acute minor bleed Give 100 units/kg of factor IX for an acute major bleed After initial dose, discuss treatment plan with paediatric haematologist-oncologist. Half-life of factor IX is 18-24 hours. Major bleed will likely need at least q 24 hour dosing.Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Ward Officer's Handbook \u00a9 Baylor College of Medicine 2015 12oNote: If using recombinant Factor IX, the dose must be increased by factor of 1.2 (For example, dose of 100 U/Kg will be 120 U/Kg for recombinant factor) It is important to round up both Factor VIII and Factor IX to a unit vial dose whenever possible to avoid waste For example, if unit vial is 500 units & patient's dose is 400 units, order 500 units Factor VIII Where Factor VIII or Factor IX is unavailable or not immediately available in emergency situations give one of the following: Plasma (FFP) at 10-20 mL/kg IV Q day to run over 1 hour Factor VIIa (NovoSeven) 90mcg/kg IV Q8 hours OSUPPORTIVE CARE: Ice for 20 min to both haemarthrosis and soft tissue bleeds Immobilize haemarthrosis for 48 hours Head trauma should have an emergent CT scan after first dose of factor given even if there are no neurologic signs For mucosal bleeding and dental extraction, may also add tranexamic acid (IV or PO) 25 mg/kg/dose PO (max dose 1.5 g/dose) 10 mg/kg/dose IV every 8 hours for 2-8 days. SeeAppendix G for the \"Tranexamic Acid Mixing Instructions & Plan\" oSeeAppendix F for \"Haemostasis Clinic Note\" for outpatient visits. 6. Von Willebrand Disease Most common inherited disorder of bleeding and patients commonly have mucocutaneous bleeding, especially epistaxis. Heavy menses in adolescent females and older females in the family is common. It is important to ask specifically about number of days & amount of bleeding as many women & adolescents will think their heavy menses are \"normal\". Diagnostics FBC (may see thrombocytopenia) Factor VIII (may be decreased because it is carried in circulation by vWF) PTT (may be prolonged due to decreased factor VIII) vWF antigen Ristocetin cofactor activity VWF multimers (if available) Treatment Desmopressin Acetate (DDAVP) can be given for patients who are sensitive (contraindicated in Type 2B vWD) oAvoid in patients less than 2 years old or less than 10 kg oPotential side effects: headache, flushing, tachyphylaxis, fluid IV0.3 micrograms/kg 20mcg) of NS and infused over 15- 30 minutes; repeat dose may be given at 8-12 hours if clinically indicated, subsequent doses given daily for 1-3 days.Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Ward Officer's Handbook 2015 13Intranasal puffs Q 12-24 hours (max 3 doses) < 50 kg: 150 mcg (1 puff of 150 mcg/puff concentration or 15 puffs of 10 mcg/puff concentration) > 50 kg: 300mcg (2 puffs of 150 mcg/puff concentration or 30 puffs of 10 mcg/puff concentration) oLimit fluid intake to 75% of maintenance for the 24 hours after a dose Cryoprecipitate (if available) 1 unit/5 kg body weight can be given in emergency settings where available and can be repeated every 8, 12, or 24 hours depending on the severity of bleeding FFPdoes not contain vWF to any level that will be therapeutic and is not indicated for vWD 7. Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) Mechanism: Self-limiting: Resolves in 80% of patients within 6 weeks to 6 months Diagnosis of ITP History/evidence of mucocutaneous bleeding, petechiae, & bruising but otherwise well appearing History of previous viral infection in the last 2-3 weeks (often, but not always) or recent live virus vaccination administration Isolated thrombocytopenia oTypically <20,000/mm3 oSmear Results consistent with ITP: Platelet size normal or large in size Occasional giant platelets seen Normal RBC & WBC morphology In the resource-limited setting, microcytic, hypochromic red cells due to underlying iron deficiency anaemia is common Occasional activated lymphocytes can also be seen oAbsence of tumor lysis (normal potassium, phosphorous, uric acid, LDH) ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion so a thorough history and physical exam and work up needs to be taken. You must rule out leukaemia. If the following features are present then you need to think about a diagnosis other than ITP . oFamily history of low platelets or bleeding disorder exposure including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, heparin, anti-arr- hythmia medications, sulfa drugs, aspirin oHaemarthrosis or bleeding oEvidence of active infection or fever oArthralgia oWeight loss, bone pain oHepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy oDysmorphic features, skeletal abnormalities, growth delay, failure to thrive oAbdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, renal failure, haemolytic anaemia in addition to thrombocytopenia then think HUS/TTP oHIV risk - exposure or HIV + status (although ITP is common with HIV) Treatment Recommendations Platelet transfusions are NOT routinely indicated in ITP as the auto-antibodies will also consume the donor platelets. They are only indicated if there is life-threateningPaediatric Haematology/Oncology Ward Officer's Handbook \u00a9 Baylor College of Medicine 2015 14bleeding and steroids and/or IVIG are given FIRST before giving the platelet transfusion. oRule-out TTP prior to platelet therapy as this condition can be worsened by platelet transfusion Council the family: No contact sports or rough play (until platelet count >50), wear helmet and seat belt, no IM injections, no NSAIDS, monitor for excessive menstrual bleeding May consider observation if: oNo mucosal bleeding or only mild petechiae on exam Give prednisone 1 mg/kg (max 60mg/day) BID x 5 days: oIf years AND platelets <20,000 (WITHOUT CONCERN FOR LEUKAEMIA) oIf platelets < 50,000 and any bleeding present (especially mucocutaneous bleeding -nose/mouth) oAlternatives: Option A - Prednisone 1/mg/kg (max 60 mg/kg) BID x 2 weeks followed by a wean by 25% every two weeks Option B - IVIG 0.8 g/kg/dose (if <50 kg) or 0.5 g/kg/dose (if >50 kg) IV slowly over 4-6 hours. Round up to vial size. Do not waste IVIG! Two doses (over two days) may be necessary if bleeding continues after one dose Adverse reaction to IVIG includes: headache, fever, nausea, & flushing which can be treated by slowing infusion and/or giving: Paracetamol 15 mg/kg PO (Max dose 650 mg/dose) Hydrocortisone 2 mg/kg IV (Max dose 250 mg/dose) Note: if unavailable, then may use another steroid such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone Antihistamine - give one of the following: Chlorpheniramine (Allergex) 1 mg (2-5 years), 2 mg (6-11 years), 4 mg (>12 years) PO Promethazine as anti-histamine 1 mg/kg/dose (for children 25 mg is usually sufficient though up to 50mg can be given) PO Patients with IgA deficiency should not receive standard IVIG preparations Give methylprednisolone 30mg/kg once daily (max 1g/dose) x 3 days IV and/or IVIG 0.8 g/kg/dose (if <50 kg) or 0.5 g/kg/dose (if >50 kg) IV x 1 over 4-6 hours and/or post-steroid/IVIG platelet transfusion if: oLife-threatening bleeding - unexplained headache, neurological changes, or head trauma. oRanitidine is recommended for GI prophylaxis when treating with corticosteroids 8. Thrombosis Management of thromboembolism Thrombolysis: Streptokinase, urokinase or tPA should be considered only with consultation with paediatric haematologist-oncologist or neurologist. A thrombophilia evaluation should be done in consultation with a haematologist Anticoagulation: (Discuss with paediatric haematologist-oncologist regarding which of the following is the best for your patient)Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Ward Officer's Handbook \u00a9 Baylor weight heparin] - 1-1.25 mg/kg Q12 hrs. If only 40 mg, 60 mg, and 100 mg pre-filled syringes are available: <10 kg - Give \u00bd of prefilled 40 mg syringe every day 10-40 kg - Give \u00bd of prefilled 40 mg syringe every 12 hours 40-60 kg - Give 40 mg prefilled syringe every 12 hours 60 kg - Give 60 mg prefilled syringe every 12 hours oUnfractionated heparin (75 units/kg load followed by 20 units/kg/hr) Protocols are emerging for subcutaneous unfractionated heparin that can be considered in a resource-limited mg/kg/day 2015 16 Oncology 1. Intravenous Fluids, Body Surface Area, and Central lines Intravenous Fluids See patient's Chemotherapy Plan (example in Appendix L) for further information on pre- and post-hydration rates as well as labs for admission, anti-emetics to pre- order, etc. Protocols differ slightly. Maintenance IV Fluid Rate o1600 mL/m2/day= 67 mL/m2/hr oOr\"4-2-1 Rule\": 4 mL/kg/hr for first 0-10 kg + 2 mL/kg/hr for next 10 kg + 1 mL/kg/hr for every kg thereafter Body Surface Area Formula oBSA (m2)= weight [kg] x height [cm] 3600 Hyper-hydration For prevent or treat tumor lysis syndrome, hyperleukocytosis: o3000 mL/m2/day which = 125 mL/m2/hr (at least 2 times maintenance) The length of time for hydration varies by protocol for pre/post chemotherapy hydration. Refer to the patient's individual Chemotherapy Plan or Roadmap. Central Lines While frequently unavailable in the resource-limited setting, these do come into use at times & sterile technique must be used in handling them Hickman/Broviac (See Appendix B for CVC protocol) Port-a-Cath (See Appendix A for Port Access Protocol) Tips to Remember :When central lines are in use, it is imperative to have anti- pseudomonal antibiotics available such as piperacillin/tazobactam or gentamicin, especially if these patients are to receive chemotherapy as pseudomonal line infections are more common & life-threatening. These antibiotics should also provide coverage of S. viridans , therefore ciprofloxacin, while providing Pseudomonas coverage, is nota suitable substitute. Central lines should only be used if adequate skill in caring for them is available, otherwise they present a greater risk than benefit. 2. Neutropenia Neutropenia is defined as a decrease in Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC): ANC =total WBC x(% neutrophils + % bands ) ANC < 1500 Mild Neutropenia ANC < 1000 Moderate Neutropenia ANC < 500 Severe NeutropeniaPaediatric Haematology/Oncology Ward Officer's Baylor College of Medicine 2015 17Patients with neutropenia are at higher risk for serious infection and therefore: Nosuppositories or enemas without oncologist approval Norectal temperature or exam Noincision & drainage of lesions without oncologist approval NoNG tube, urine catheter, or LP without oncologist approval Prior to blood work or IV, area should be prepped with betadine 3. Fever & Neutropenia Assessment Patients should be assessed immediately upon arrival to the clinic/emergency center and antibiotic therapy instituted immediately after obtaining blood work. Work Up Complete physical exam (including visual perianal exam remembering that physical signs of infection may be subtle in the neutropenic patient). Full Blood Count (FBC) Type & Cross Blood Culture (before giving antibiotics) Place IV cannula Obtain according to the presence of symptoms other than fever: Renal Function Tests (RFT) Urinalysis (UA) / Urine culture Chest x-ray (CXR) Stool & throat cultures Therapy Start gram-negative rods coverage with an intravenous cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone orcefotaxime ceftriaxone - divided every 6-8 hours oInfants month to 12 years (<50 kg): 33-75 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours Meningitis: 75 6 hours (maximum: 2 gram/dose or 12 gram/DAY) o Children >12 years (50 kg) and Adults: Moderate to severe infection: 1-2 gram every 6-8 hours infection: 2 hours (maximum: 2 gram/dose or 12 gram/DAY) oA typical course would be 10-14 days but should be determined based on the patient's fever curve, blood culture, absolute neutrophil counts, presence of indwelling intravenous catheter and other clinical factors. Also start a 6 mo - 4 years: 8-10 mg/kg/dose IV Q 12 hours (max: 750 mg/dose) 4 years old: 8-10 mg/kg/dose IV daily (max: 750 mg/ mg/kg/dose IV Q 24 hours; (max: 360 mg/dose) Ifseptic at presentation or still febrile for >24 hours despite cefotaxime and gentamicin, then add gram positive bacterial coverage like vancomycin. Vancomycin: 10 to 15 mg/kg/dose IV Q 8 hours (max: 500 mg/dose; 2 g/day) If available and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <500, consider G-CSF (Neupogen) at 5 micrograms/kg/day IV or subcutaneously for at least 5 days or preferably until the ANC is >1000 on 2 consecutive days. Other Considerations When using aminoglycosides and/or Vancomycin: oMonitor urea & creatinine at initiation Then twice weekly (as these agents are nephrotoxic). oWhere available, drugs levels can be obtained if therapy will continue for more than 3 days with either agent. oIdeally maintain at least \u00bd maintenance fluids while on these nephrotoxic medications to protect renal function If the patient has an acute abdomen then add anaerobic coverage with one of the following: oClindamycin 40mg/kg/day (max: 500mg/dose) o*Note: if having GI symptoms (oral sores, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain) then you may consider adding as well. If the patient has a positive blood culture: oDaily cultures should be ordered until negative Rotate lumens for antibiotic infusion in patients with central lines. Where indwelling central lines (e.g. Broviac or Port-a-Cath) are available & used, ready access to anti-pseudomonal antibiotics must be assured. When they present with fever and you are starting antibiotics, add an anti-pseudomonal antibiotics. oThese agents include: piperacillin/tazobactam ticarcillin/clavulanic acid gentamicin oWithout these medications, surgically placed central lines should be used only with due regard to the risk incurred. 4. Anti-Fungal Therapy Consider in the persistently febrile patient with negative cultures, or the patient with febrile neutropenia for greater than five days. Nystatin oUsed for thrush Infants: 1 mL of 100,000 units/mL solution applied to each side of the mouth four times per day Children and adults: 5 mL PO four times per day swish and swallowPaediatric Haematology/Oncology Ward oUsed in AML and for the treatment of candidiasis oMonitor liver function tests (AST/ALT q 2-3 weeks) Children (>14 days) Prophylactic dose: 6 mg/kg/day once daily rounded to 25 mg increments. (Max: 200 mg/day) Treatment dose- see table below Max: 400 mg/day unless systemic infection then max dose is 600mg/day) In general, treat for 2 weeks after resolution of symptoms/clearance from blood culture. Fluconazole Indication Day One Daily TherapyMinimum Duration Oropharyngeal Candidiasis 6 mg/kg 3 mg/kg 14 days Candidiasis mg/kg 3 mg/kg (in some cases, 12mg/kg/day is needed)21 days Candidiasis 12 mg/kg 28 days Amphotericin B oFollow urea/creatinine daily initially until full dose reached, then 3 x per week oFollow serum K+ daily, if possible oFollow Mg hypokalemia or hypomagnesaemia oAmphotericin B Dosing: 0.25 mg/kg/day for the first dose infused over 2-6 hours Escalate up to 0.5-1 mg/kg/day as indicated by the clinical situation Duration of therapy varies but usual is 4-12 weeks. oMay bolus NS 10 mL/kg (Max. 500 mL IV) over 1-2 hours prior to administering amphotericin B to minimize renal toxicity oToprevent a drug reaction , pre-medicate with: Chlorpheniramine (Allergex) 1 mg (2-5 years), 2 mg (6- 11 yrs.), 4 mg (>12 years) PO / or Promethazine 1 mg/kg/dose (for children 25 mg is usually sufficient though up to 50mg can be given) IV/PO every 6 hours as needed Hydrocortisone 2 mg/kg IV (Max dose 250 mg/dose). Note: if unavailable then may use another steroid such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone oTo treat rigors with chills: Meperidine (Pethidine, Demerol) 0.5 mg/kg (Max Dose: 100 mg) to pre- medicate in the future. 5. Antiviral Therapy Diagnosis made using cultures or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antigenaemia where available. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) can be diagnosed clinically. Once diagnosed, stop chemotherapy and start acyclovir.Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Ward Officer's oBaseline prior to therapy, then monitor urea/creatinine twice weekly oMaintain adequate hydration with maintenance IV fluid rate oAdjust dose for renal impairment oInitiate within 72 hours of lesions/rash (the earlier the better)! Oral Acyclovir Dosing: HSV: 20 mg/kg/dose PO (max 800 mg/dose) q 8 hours PO x 7-14 days or>12 years 400-800 mg/dose 4-5 times per day for 5-10 days HSV (genital) adolescents: 400 mg PO three times daily for hours x 7-10 days oVaricella (immunocompromised): 10 mg/kg/dose IV q 8 hours x 7-10 days or no new lesions for 48 hours. Higher doses of up to 15 mg/kg have been used for life threatening illness. Best to initiate within 24 hours of rash, even if it is beyond 24 hours still initiate because of high mortality and complications in immunocompromised host. Patients with symptomatic primary CMV infection should be treated with ganciclovir 10 mg/kg/day IV q 12 hours for 2-4 weeks 6.Pneumocystis jirovecii Prophylaxis (formerly PCP prophylaxis) All patients on chemotherapy should receive PJP prophylaxis that continues until 6 months after completion of chemotherapy. TMP/SMX: (See chart below) Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) Can be given once daily every day or twice daily three times per week using the dosing below: BSA (m2) Regular Strength Tab 80/400Liquid (mL) 40/200 per 5 mL <0.3 N/A 2.5 0.3 - 0.79 0.5 5 0.8 - 1.39 1 10 1.40 - 1.89 1.5 15 >1.9 2 20 Intolerance to TMP/SMX can occur. In such cases use either dapsone or pentamidine, where available, as per the dosing schedule below: Daily Dapsone: 2 mg/kg mg/kg (Max: 200 mg/dose) by mouth once per week OR - Pentamidine: given once monthly either aerosolized or IV: oAerosolized < 5 yrs.: 8 mg/kg/dose (Max: 300 mg/dose) > 5 yrs.: 300 mg/dose in 5 mL sterile water Administer with salbutamol 2 puffs pre- & post-pentamidine oIntravenous 4 mg/kg given once monthly 7. Chemotherapy Anaphylaxis Precautions The following medications can cause anaphylaxis reactions: Etoposide or teniposide Carboplatin SLOWLY (1 unit/minute) Paclitaxel Treatment of Reactions: Grade I - II: Hives, pruritis, mild wheezing, 1. Stop infusion , change IV tubing, start NS at 1600 mL/m2/day (maintenance rate) 2.Give Hydrocortisone 2 mg/kg IV (Max: 250 mg/dose) oNote: if unavailable then may use another prednisone, methylprednisolone or dexamethasone 3.Give 2 mg (6-11 years), 4 mg (>12 years) PO / or promethazine 1 mg/kg/dose (for children 25 mg is usually sufficient though up to 50mg can be given) IV/PO Grade III-IV: Anaphylaxis, shock, hypotension, serum sickness, chest tightness, severe bronchospasm, cough, chills, vomiting, tachycardia, cyanosis 1. Stop infusion , change IV tubing, start NS at 1600 mL/m2/day (maintenance rate) 2.Give epinephrine 0.01 give antihistamine & hydrocortisone (per dosing above). 5.Monitor patient closely & repeat medications as needed given clinical condition For any reaction monitor vital signs every 2-5 minutes until patient is stable including heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, & pulse oximetry (where available) Chemotherapy that causes a reaction must not be repeated as a repeat dose can be fatal. A paediatric hematologist-oncologist ought to be consulted to determine if an alternate medication would be possible. All resuscitation management should be done per the guidelines of Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) and the above instructions are to just be a summary of overall emergency support 8. Oncologic Emergencies: Tumor Lysis Syndrome and Space Occupying Lesions A. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) Lysis of tumor cells releases electrolytes & urea cycle resulting in 2015 22Severe TLS seen with large tumor burden including (but not minimum every two days (up to every 6 hrs as resources allow) Urea, creatinine & electrolytes Calcium Magnesium Phosphate Uric Acid Maintain urine output at > 2.5 mL/kg/hr Specific Management : Hyperuricemia Management Hydration with 3000 mL/m2/day (125 mL/m2/hr or 2 times maintenance) with fluids NOT containing potassium (e.g. DNS, NS, D5W, etc.) Allopurinol 100 mg/m2/dose PO given three times daily (Max: 800 mg/day). Typically available in 100 mg tablets. Rasburicase: typically not available in the resource-limited setting Hyperkalaemia If K >7, then obtain an EKG Avoid potassium in fluids to help prevent this complication Stop any potassium supplementation if present If there are EKG changes (peaked T wave, loss of P wave, widened QRS complex) then treat with: oCalcium gluconate 10% solution at a dose of 50 mg/kg or 0.5 mL/kg (max 20 mL = 2 g) slowly over 5 min IV, this dose is equivalent to 50 mg/kg (ideally through a central line). This is very important to stabilize the cardiac membrane! oRegular insulin 0.1 units/kg (max 10 units) and dextrose 0.5 g/kg over 30 min, oKayexalate 1 g/kg/dose PO four times daily (1g/kg lowers potassium by 1 mEq if patient is stooling appropriately) oInhaled Salbutamol 2.5 mg (<25 kg), 5mg (25-50 kg), 10 mg (>50 kg) in 2 mL of saline and inhaled. Hyperphosphatemia Consider aluminum hydroxide 25 mg/kg/dose four times daily & avoid foods containing large amounts of phosphate to lessen enteral phosphate absorption. Dialysis, where available, is the only therapeutic option Hypocalcaemia Symptoms of hypocalcaemia - anorexia, vomiting, cramps, spasms, tetany, seizures Avoid calcium unless symptoms are severe or life-threatening If symptomatic, then treat 2015 23over 5-10 min, may repeat in 6 hours or follow with a continuous infusion of 200-800 mg/kg/day (ideally through a central line). Hyperleukocytosis Defined as WBC > 100,000/mm3 Commonly seen in ALL and AML at presentation or relapse High risk for pulmonary & CNS complications due to viscosity & stasis oIV fluid rate 3,000 mL/m2/day = 125 mL/m2/hr (at least 2 times maintenance) oMonitor WBC counts along with TLS labs (minimum daily up to q6 hrs as able) oMonitor pulse oximetry for evidence of pulmonary complications, continuous monitoring where possible oTransfuse pRBC with extreme caution (only indicated if cardiovascular compromise secondary to anaemia) as this may increase viscosity. Hgb should be kept below 8.5 g/dL oMay transfuse platelets for active bleeding or platelets <50,000/mm3 oAlthough not available in resource-limited settings, leukopheresis is recommended if possible oCytoreductive medications like hydroxyurea or cytarabine may be considered B. Space Occupying Lesions Mediastinal mass/upper airway lesion Can cause superior vena cava syndrome and tracheal compression Avoid sedation Avoid procedures that may compromise airway & consult anesthesia for procedures Elevate head of bed Obtain diagnostic tissue with the least invasive method - e.g. peripheral lymph node biopsy preferred over thoracotomy to biopsy chest mass. May need emergency chemotherapy, steroids, and/or radiation therapy as a lifesaving measure, even prior to full diagnostic work-up. Intracranial mass/spinal cord compression Emergently give dexamethasone cord compression Dexamethasone Dose: <20 kg: Give dexamethasone 2 mg IV every 6 hours >20 kg: Give dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours (max 16 mg/day) Give Dexamethasone even before imaging! Taper over 1 week. Chronic low daily dose may be necessary. While on steroids it is always good practice to also add ranitidine. Dexamethasone is strongly preferred to other steroids due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. For signs of increased intracranial pressure Airway - Breathing - Circulation Fluid restrict to 0.75 x maintenance using NS Dexamethasone (dose as above) IV every 4-6 hours Acetazolamide 5 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours Mannitol 0.25-1 IV bolus, may repeat every 6-8 hours CT scan Elevate Haematology/Oncology Handbook \u00a9 Baylor College of Medicine 2015 24Any central nervous system involvement by tumor requires immediate involvement of neurosurgery May need emergency chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy as a lifesaving measure, even prior to full diagnostic work-up 9. Immunizations in Oncology Patients Live vaccines, especially oral polio must be avoided for patient & family members during chemotherapy. Yellow fever, MMR, varicella, oral polio and intranasal influenza vaccines must be avoided by the patient as well as the family and close contacts Killed or recombinant vaccines can be administered to the patient & family members; response is generally seen despite immunosuppression; however, patients undergoing bone marrow transplant generally require re-immunization 1 year post-transplant. Live vaccines can be resumed 6 months after chemotherapy is completed. Annual injectable influenza vaccine is recommended for immunosuppressed patients where the vaccine is available.Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Ward Officer's Handbook \u00a9 Baylor College Management & Palliative Care 1. Palliative Care Palliative care begins when an illness is diagnosed and continues irrespective of whether or not a child is receiving disease-directed therapy. In 2002, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined palliative care as: \"An approach which improves quality of life of patients and their families facing life- threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification andimpeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems , physical, psychosocial and spiritual.\" Palliative Care Continuum Common Symptoms Requiring Management in the Course of Oncology Care Anorexia/cachexia Dyspnea Anxiety Fatigue Constipation Mucositis Delirium Nausea/vomiting Depression Pain Diarrhea Skin problems Symptoms frequently interfere with the patient's and family's capacity to do the things they enjoy. They can impair the oncologist's ability to administer anticancer therapy, particularly when the symptoms are the result of the anticancer treatment itself. If left unmanaged, they may lead to changes that shorten survival . Besides the physical manifestations of a symptom, always look for the influence of psychological, social, spiritual, end-of-life, and loss issues. When modification of the disease process is no longer feasible, symptom relief to manage the experience may become the total focus of care. 2. Pain control Pain is a common, underreported, and under-diagnosed problem for hospitalized children world-wide, especially for infants or developmentally-delayed children. Types of Pain: Somatic pain : mediated by the somatic nervous system, serves skin, bone, and muscle. Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Ward Officer's Handbook \u00a9 Baylor College of Medicine 2015 26oPain localization is precise and is often described as sharp, aching, or throbbing . Visceral pain : mediated by the autonomic nervous system, serves internal structures such as the gastrointestinal tract. oIt is typically difficult to localize or describe, and is sometimes characterized ascrampy . Neuropathic pain: has been defined as a primary lesion or dysfunction of the nervous system. It can be either peripheral or central. oPatients tend to describe neuropathic pain with words like burning, tingling, numbness, shooting, stabbing, or electric-like feelings . Pain Assessment Should be performed as part of routine vital signs and included in all daily progress notes Toddler - School Age Pain Scale FLACC Infant Pain Scale: For Ages 2015 27WHO Analgesic Ladder Advocates a step-wise approach to treating pain At every step of the analgesic ladder non-opioid analgesics form the basis of the pain management. Paracetamol and NSAIDs ( if not contraindicated ) should always Non-opioid Analgesics mg; 4 g/day) oAvoid this medication if the patient has liver disease Ibuprofen 10 mg/kg/dose every 6-8 hours (Max: single dose 800 mg; 2400 mg/day) oAvoid this medication in patients with thrombocytopenia oGastrointestinal prophylaxis with ranitidine recommended Ranitidine: mg/kg/dose Non-Opioids Intravenous patients: <10 kg should not exceed 0.5 mg 10-20 kg should not exceed 1 mg 20-40 kg should not exceed 2 mg >40 kg should not exceed 4 mg. oFurther titration should be done in consultation with the paediatric haematologist-oncologist. Oral Morphine Sulfate Immediate Release 0.15 to 0.5 mg/kg/dose PO every 4-6 hours oAppropriate to use initially when calculating total daily dose morphine required by patient oAppropriate to use for breakthrough pain Oral morphine Sulfate Extended or Sustained Release oThese pills should never be cut or crushed!!!! oCalculate immediate release morphine dosing required for patient over 24 hour period of time and then divide that total 24 hour dose to every 8 or every 12 hours for extended release dose Note: IV to PO dosing conversion for morphine is: 1:3 (1 mg IV is = 3 mg PO). Note: Meperidine (Pethidine, Demerol) should no longer be used because it is considered inferior to morphine due to its toxicity on the central nervous system . Special Considerations -Adjuvant Analgesics: Neuropathic Starting dose: 0.1 mg/kg PO initially at bedtime May advance as tolerated over weeks to 0.5-2 mg/kg at 5 mg/kg/dose (max: 300 mg/dose) PO at bedtime If ineffective ,increase the dose every 3-5 days, first to 5 mg/kg PO q 12 h, then to 5 mg/kg PO q 8 h. (Max: 3,600 mg/day). Always remember doNOT withdraw this medication abruptly , since withdrawal can precipitate seizures and increase pain. Bone pain : oConsider addition of a corticosteroid to NSAIDS and opioids to start gastrointestinal prophylaxis, like ranitidine, when starting steroid treatment. 3. Nausea/Vomiting Give these medications 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy Scheduled dosing is recommended especially for platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens Anti-emetic receptor mg if <50 kg and 1mg if >50 kg, max 1mg) IV or PO daily/every 12 hours PRN or Scheduled oBest for moderate to highly emetogenic chemotherapy Dexamethasone: oDose: 6 mg/m2/dose (max 10 mg/dose) IV or PO given daily prior to chemotherapy or every 12 hours Promethazine (Phenergan): oDose: 1 mg/kg/dose (for children 25 mg is usually sufficient though up to 50mg can be given) IV/PO every 6 hours as needed or scheduled Metoclopramide (Reglan, Clopamon): oDose: 0.1 mg/kg (max 10 mg) IV every 6-8 hours oGreat for moderately emetogenic chemotherapy or delayed nausea/vomiting oCan give 1 mg/kg as an anti-emetic, but an anti-histamine must be given simultaneously to dystonic reaction.Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Ward Officer's Handbook \u00a9 29Emetogenicity of Chemotherapy Agents Note: (sd) = standard dosing (hd) = high dose 4. Constipation Most commonly caused by vincristine, inactivity & opioid medications No rectal exam, rectal temperature, enemas, or suppositories for patients on chemotherapy unless discussed with a paediatric haematologist-oncologist oEven minor trauma to the rectal mucosa can introduce a life-threatening infection in patients with neutropenia Management A bowel regimen is recommended for all patients on vincristine therapy as preventing constipation is preferred to treating after it has started Ensure patient is hydrated & consider giving one of the following: oBisacodyl (Dulcolax) 3 - 12 years: 5 mg PO once daily to BID (max: 10mg) > 12 years: 10 mg PO once daily to TID (max: 30mg) oDocusate sodium (Colace, a stool softener) < 3 years: 30 mg by mouth divided once daily to 4 times daily 3 - 6 years: 60 mg by mouth divided once daily to 4 times daily > 6 years: 150 mg by mouth divided once daily to 4 times daily oLactulose 1-3 mL/kg/day divided by mouth twice daily Paraffin (mineral oil) <12 daily g/kg/day (max 17 g/day) in 4-8 oz. of liquid by mouth daily. Avoid mixing in milk, orange juice or formula. Bowel prep regimen (Klean-Prep) is an option also. Please read the sachet for dosing instructions. oPrune juice 120-240 mL PO daily to twice daily; to reduce sweetness, mix with a little lemon juice.None Mild Moderate 30oSenna (stimulant laxative) 2-6 years: 4.3 mg dose PO once to twice daily 6-12 years: 8.6 mg dose PO once to twice daily Age >12 years: 17.2 mg dose PO once to twice daily Since this is a stimulant, it must be used in combination with a stool softener and should not be used on a regular basis 5. Mucositis & Oral Hygiene Mucositis Grading System Grade Symptoms I Painless ulcers, erythema, mild soreness II Painful erythema, oedema, ulcers; patient able to eat III As per Grade II but patient is unable to eat IV Requires parenteral or NG tube nutritional support Medication options for mouth care Mouthwash: 1 L NS + 1 teaspoon table salt + 1 teaspoon NaHCO 3+ 5 mL glycerin oTake 10 mL swish & spit out four times daily Nystatin: can be used as prophylaxis or to treat thrush oInfants: 1 mL of 100,000 units/mL solution applied to each side of mouth four times daily oChildren: 5 mL swish & swallow four times daily Magnesium or Aluminum Hydroxide + Chlorpheniramine syrup + Lidocaine (\"Magic Mouthwash\") oMix in a 1:1:1 ratio (e.g. 50 mL of each), and take 5 mL per dose, swish & spit four times daily (if child is too young to spit, then leave out the lidocaine) Chemotherapy Agents & Mucositis Severity therapies: Complementary or alternative medical approaches may help some patients. Progressive muscle relaxation, massage therapy, guided imagery, hypnosis, meditation, music, or aromatherapy can be particularly useful tools to decrease anxiety.Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Ward Officer's Handbook \u00a9 Baylor College of Medicine 2015 31Patients should be advised to minimize or avoid caffeine and sleep habits should be evaluated as necessary. Pharmacologic management: Acute anxiety oBenzodiazepines are usually the medications of choice for the short-term management of acute anxiety reactions when immediate relief is desired. oChoose a benzodiazepine based on the desired half-life . oLonger half-life benzodiazepines have a more some (e.g., diazepam [t 1/2= 20-54 hr]) may accumulate. Diazepam : 0.05 mg/kg/dose IV every 4 hours PRN (max starting dose 1 mg, max after titrating 10 mg/dose, max: 0.3 mg/kg/dose) oMidazolam, with its very short half-life (t 1/2=1.8-6.4 hr), may be an ideal anxiolytic/amnestic for procedures, particularly when given IV. Midazolam: 0.05 mg/kg, titrate to effect (max starting dose 1 mg, total max after titrating: 6 mg) oWhichever medication is chosen, start with low doses and titrate to effect and tolerability. 7. Malignant Wound Care Themanagement principles and dressing choices for malignant wounds are the same as those for decubitus ulcers . However, malignant wounds bring up a few additional issues that deserve comment. Antineoplastic treatments may offer significant palliation of the symptoms from a malignant wound. oRadiation therapy may decrease bleeding, pain, and exudate. oChemotherapy may lead to wound healing in patients with responsive disease. Superficial infection: topical treatment with metronidazole or silver sulfadiazine may be sufficient Deep tissue infection: systemic metronidazole should be used Non-healing wound: topical agents such as povidone (Betadine) that are cytotoxic to bacteria can be used. oBetadine will help keep the wound clean, although some patients find it irritating and painful. oBecause of its cytotoxic effect on granulation tissue, Betadine should not be used for wounds that are expected to heal. Odor Management: oMetronidazole IV liquid on bandages to help odor oOdor absorbers can be used in the patient's room Kitty litter or activated charcoal can be placed on a cookie tray underneath the bed. Secondary dressing that contains charcoal or a disposable diaper can be used to cover a particularly odorous wound. oIntroduce a competing odor Bowl of vinegar, vanilla, or coffee Essential oils - peppermint oil or wintergreen on a scarf, mask, or on top of the bandaging may help with the smell. Avoid direct contact with skin without a carrier oil. Also try: eucalyptus, tea tree oil, lavender, thyme, bergamot, & orange oil Fragrances and perfumes are often poorly tolerated by patients and should be avoided.Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Ward Officer's Handbook bleeding: Silver nitrate or cautery can be used for frank bleeding. oRadiation therapy is very effective for control of local bleeding. oConsider topical application of tranexamic acid (IV solution or crushed tablets mixed with saline) to help control wound bleeding 8. Dyspnea Opioids: Opioids are the most effective medication for symptomatic control of dyspnea. Mechanism of Action: not well understood. Possible they alter the perception of dyspnea in a manner analogous to their alteration of the perception of pain. Opioids relieve dyspnea at doses far lower than those that depress the respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. oOpioid-na\u00efve patients - Small amounts of morphine can relieve dyspnea. Morphine: For child >14 years of age: start with 10-15 mg PO q 1 h PRN or 5 mg IV/SC q 30 min PRN. Titrate to effect using standard opioid dosing guidelines. The duration of the effect is about 4 hours. oPatients on baseline opioids - Start by increasing the opioid dose by 25%; this often provides relief, and then titrate to effect. Oxygen Oxygen can reverse hypoxemia. oIf hypoxemia is the cause of dyspnea, oxygen may be the only required therapy. oHowever, the perceived benefit of oxygen among dyspneic cancer patients far exceeds the number with hypoxemia . Other management: Sit the child upright, ensure airflow over the child's face, reassurance, relaxation and distraction Terminal Atropine (anticholinergic) oChildren : 0.01-0.02 mg/kg SC/IV/IM (if <5 then dose, kg then 0.1 Hospice/End of Life Death: The death of a child affects the physical and psychological wellbeing of family members for the rest of their lives. Events occurring around the time of death, both positive and negative, play a critical role in defining how family members grieve and ultimately come to terms with the event. Families who have lost a child have identified several needs regarding end-of-life care. oNeed to have complete information honestly communicated oEasy access to essential staff members who will be supportive oAssistance in coordinating necessary services oHave their relationship with their child maintained as much as possible oBe allowed to feel that their child's life and death has meaning oAlways use the child's name when talking to a family The family will need psychosocial, emotional, and spiritual support which can be provided by a multidisciplinary team of caregivers: nurses, social workers, psychologists, traditional healers, spiritual leaders, and family members.Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Ward Officer's Handbook \u00a9 Baylor College of Medicine 2015 33References 1.

Scrub in a concentric circle extending 5 cm in all directions of the port. Stabilize the port between your index and middle finger (2ndand 3rddigits) with one hand and insert the needle into the center of the port until contact with the bottom of the port. Pull back on the syringe to assess for a blood return Flush port with 5ml of heparin/NS Cover port needle and sterile port area with Tegaderm or sterile dressing. It is critical that this area remain sterile so bacteria do not enter the port via the needle. If drawing labs, clamp port line, detach heparin/NS syringe, and attach a 5ml sterile syringe Draw 5ml of blood and waste (this blood is contaminated with heparin) Attach another 5ml syringe and draw what labs are needed After blood drawn, flush another 5ml of heparin/NS and clamp. The port must be flushed with 5ml of heparin/NS after every blood draw or infusion of a medication/blood product if the line is going to be locked. This will ensure that the line does not form a thrombus and remains patent. If medications or IV fluids will be running through the port then flushing is not necessary. Use an alcohol swab on the hub of the port line and any cap, syringe, or IV line you are connecting to the port every time. This will prevent the port from getting infected. Remember to draw slowly as this will prevent creating a vaccum in the port and introducing air into the line. If air is in the line, draw on the heparin syringe until all of the air is in the syringe. Hold the syringe vertical (allowing air to go to the top) and flush the heparin/NS. Adapted from guidelines from the Texas Children's Hospital Vascular CATHETER (CVC) CARE &MAINTENANCE POLICY OBJECTIVE To provide guidelines to minimize the risk of infection and to maintain patency of central vencous catheters (CVCs) used for vascular access in the administration of fluids, medications, blood products and for blood sampling. General Info 1.1 Assess the skin around the dressing and the security of the luer-lock connections. Report temperatures greater than or equal to 38.0 C to the physician Report evidence of skin infection (erythema, edema, pain) to the physician 1.2 Change IV tubing every 4 days when infusing fluids or medications. Change Access Cap every 4 days if getting infusions orevery 7 days at the time of the heparin flush if not receiving infusions (if access caps are available). 1.3 Use 10 ml diameter syringes when flushing or administering medications directly into access cap on lumen. 1.4 Flush all dormant or intermittent lumens with 3mL of 100 IU/mL heparin after infusing medications or fluids, after drawing blood, or at least every 24 hours. Dormant lumens = lumen not infusing fluids regularly Intermittent lumens = lumens intermittently infusing with fluids To make heparin: Draw up 1 mL of 1000 IU/mL Heparin in a 10 ml syringe Draw up 9 mL of 0.9% normal saline in the heparin syringe Total concentration will be 100 IU/mL 1.5 Plastic hemostats/clamps (if available) should be kept at the bedside of a patient (avoid using metal hemostats to avoid tearing the catheter). The hemostats/clamps can be utilized to clamp the catheter in the event of breakage to prevent an air embolus or blood loss. 1.6 Before each time you flush or put any medicine into the IV tubing, put on non-sterile gloves and wash the injection cap with sterile alcohol (spirits) for 15 second in a back and forth twisting manner. Let dry for 15 seconds (do not blow on it or fan it dry).Botswana Paediatric Haematology & Oncology Dressing Change 2.1 Change dressing weekly unless the dressing becomes wet, loose or soiled. 2.2 Chlorhexidine (if available) can be used instead of Povidone Iodine/Betadine. 2.3 Gather the following supplies: CVC dressing kit (mask for patient & provider/assistants, sterile gloves, sterile drape, clear occlusive dressing, chlorohexidine swab sticks or povidone iodine/betadine swab alcohol pads, Biopatch antimicrobial disc, sterile gauze, securement strips, tape 1 inch wide). Exam gloves 2.4 Perform hand hygiene with alcohol gel or soap/water before starting the procedure. 2.5 Open dressing change kit: Open sterile drape and add sterile supplies to field or open sterile dressing kit and organize supplies using sterile technique (use sterile gloves to touch supplies if needed). Place mask on patient, provider and any assistants. 2.6 Put on a pair of non-sterile exam gloves. Remove occlusive dressing from CVC site starting at the bottom and working up towards the insertion site. Utilize a sterile alcohol pad to help remove adhesive from tape if needed. DO NOT USE SCISSORS to remove dressing. 2.7 Observe the site for edema, redness, and active drainage. 2.8 Remove exam gloves; perform hand hygiene again before putting on the sterile gloves. (You may want to bring your own specific size of sterile gloves as the kits often have smaller standard size gloves). 2.9 Cholrohexadine: A - If only one chlorohexadine swab stick with sponge, then scrub the site for 30 seconds using friction and back/forth & up/down, diagonal and circular patterns. Allow skin to dry completely (30-60 seconds). [Do not blow on it to dry or wave hands back and forth]. B - If triple pack of cholorhexadine swabs, then use one of the swab sticks to clean the skin around the CVC for at least 10 seconds. Use repeated back and forth strokes of the swab stick. Repeat with the other two swab sticks scrubbing for at least 10 seconds with each stick. Wait until dry, at least 30 seconds. [Do not blow on it to dry or wave hands back and forth]. Place the chlorohexidine antimicrobial disc (e.g. Biopatch) with the blue side (writing side) up and the white side next to the skin at the CVC insertion site. Position it where the slit is in the direction the catheter will lie once it is secured with the occlusive dressing. Povidone Iodine/Betadine: Add 3 povidone iodine/betadine swabsticks in the sterile field of the dressing change kit (if not available, use sterile gauze clamped in sterile forceps -dip into sterile bowl of betadine). Clean the skin around the CVC site with one of the swab sticks making concentric circles (start near the line insertion point, then make a small circle, then a larger circle, then a larger circle) around the CVC to approximate the size of the dressing. Repeat with other two swab sticks. Wait until dry, at least two minutes. 2.10 Remove backing from the clear dressing and apply over the catheter area. If the catheter is a tunneled line, loop the excess catheter within the clear dressing using securement strips from the kit. 2.11 Place a 2.5 cm wide by 5-7 cm long piece of tape under the catheter at the edge of the transparent dressing. Place another 2.5 cm on top of the previous piece of tape. Add date and initialsBotswana Paediatric Haematology & Oncology Changing Access Caps(If available) 3.1 Active lumen access caps (continuous and intermittent infusions) are changed, ideally, with IV tubing changes (every 4 days), when blood samples for cultures are obtained, or ideally, at least every 7 days, if no IV infusions are given. 3.2 Dormant lumen (no meds except heparin per protocol) access caps are changed weekly at the time of a heparin flush. 3.3 Every time the access cap is removed from the catheter hub, it should be replaced with a new sterile access cap. 3.4 Flush new access cap with normal saline to expel air prior to placement on the CVC. 3.5 Clean the connection site of the CVC/access cap with a sterile alcohol swab for 15 seconds and allow to dry for 15 seconds. 3.6 Clamp the catheter using the in-line clamp or plastic forcep clamp. NEVER CHANGE CAP WITHOUT CLAMPING LUMEN FIRST! Remove old access cap, clean the threads of the catheter hub with a sterile alcohol swab for 15 seconds and allow to dry for 15 seconds. 3.7 Place new sterile access cap on the hub of the catheter. Documentation 4.1 Documentation should include the following: Assessment of the condition of the dressing Catheter related procedures: date, time, indication, description, complications, medications given, and patient response. Notification of physician with catheter related issues, including time and response Flushing the Catheter 5.1 Flush the catheter on a regular schedule after you draw blood after you put any fluid through the tube anytime you see blood in the catheter cap. 5.2 Reminder: Every time you flush the catheter with normal saline or heparin, use the \"push-and- pause\" method: push a little solution, then pause for 1-2 seconds, then push a little more, pause, and so on. This method cleans the inside of the catheter tube. 5.3 Prepare a clean work area & wash your hands. 5.4 Gather: normal saline (one 10 ml syringe for each lumen) syringes (one 10 100 IU/ml heparin for each lumen) non-sterile gloves alcohol wipes 5.5 Make sure syringes do not have air bubbles in them. Point the syringe with the tip facing upward, pull back slightly on the plunger, and squirt the air bubble out before using. 5.6 Put on non-sterile gloves 5.7 Scrub the injection cap with a sterile alcohol wipe for 15 seconds and let dry for 15 seconds. 5.8 Attach the normal saline syringe tip into the injection cap. Unclamp the catheter. Flush with 3-5 mL of normal saline using the push-and-pause method. Remove syringe from the injection cap & clamp catheter. 5.9 Scrub the injection cap with a sterile alcohol wipe for 15 seconds and let it dry for 15 seconds. 5.10 Attach the heparin syringe tip into the injection cap, unclamp catheter, and flush with 3 mL of heparin using the push-and-pause method. Remove syringe from injection cap. Clamp the catheter. 5.11 Repeat steps 5.7-5.10 for each lumen of the catheter. Use a new alcohol wipe, normal saline and heparin syringe for each lumen.Botswana Paediatric Haematology & Oncology Obtaining a Blood Sample from CVC 6.1 Specimens should be drawn from the red lumen or large port/distal port. 6.2 Assemble these supplies: 0.9% normal saline flush in a 10 mL syringe (x2) heparin flush for dormant lumen in a 10 mL syringe (100 units/mL) exam gloves 3-way stopcock (if available) specimen tubes alcohol prep pads (sterile) 10 mL syringes (however many needed for amount of specimens to obtain) sterile access cap if change is needed Stopcock Method Without Stopcock 6.3 Assemble the 3-way stopcock (if available) with \"waste syringe\" & flush syringe.Scrub the CVC/access cap with sterile alcohol wipe for 15 seconds, let dry for 15 seconds. 6.4 Scrub the CVC/access cap with sterile alcohol wipe for 15 seconds, let dry for 15 seconds.Attach waste syringe and unclamp lumen. Draw out 5 ml of \"waste blood\" and discard into biohazard container. Reclamp the lumen. 6.5 Attach stopcock to CVC access cap. (A single stopcock or 2 stopcocks can be luer locked together based on clinical need.) - If stopcock not available, skip step & attach waste syringe per step 6.6 to access cap.Scrub CVC/access cap again as per step 6.3 6.6 Turn stopcock so that only the waste syringe is turned on and unclamp the lumen & draw out 3-5 ml of \"waste blood.\" Turn the stop cock to turn off to the waste syringe & leave attached. (If not stopcock, then waste the 5 ml).Attach specimen syringe and unclamp lumen. Withdraw specimen into the syringe & reclamp the lumen. 6.7 Open the specimen syringe by turning the stopcock. Draw the specimen into the syringe(s).Scrub CVC/access cap again as per step 6.3 6.8 Flush \"waste\" back into CVC unless otherwise ordered & removes syringe.Attach flush syringe unclamp Clamp lumen. 6.9 Attach saline flush syringe and open stopcock to flush lumen.

There are three options for its use for mouth bleeding: 1.Tranexamic acid tablets or IV solution. Typical dosing is 25mg/kg (max 1.5gm/dose) every 8 hours for 3-7 days. The tablets are typically 500 mg and the IV solution is 500mg/5ml. 2.The IV ampules of tranexamic acid 500mg/5ml can be used to make a 5% oral solution by diluting 5 ml of 500 mg/5ml tranexamic acid injection with 5 ml of sterile water. Ideally, this should be made with a filter needle. The solution can be taken orally per the same dosing per #1. 3.For mouth-only bleeding, the tranexamic acid solution, either from IV form as per #2 or crushed tablets, can be swished in the mouth. Place 5ml of the tranexamic acid solution to be swished in the mouth for around one minute then spit out. To create the solution from tablets, place each 500 mg tablet into 20 ml of water and let stand. Begin stirring and continue until the tablets are completely disintegrated to form a fine particular suspension. Dispersion time for each 500mg tablet is 2-5 minutes. The solution can be used for 5 days before expiry.Appendix H -Management of for prevention of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (formerly PCP) for prolonged chemotherapy or steroid use: Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX)* Can be given once daily or three times per week twice daily using the dosing below: BSA (m2) Regular Strength Tab 80/400Liquid (mL) 40/200 per 5 ml <0.3 N/A 2.5 0.3 - 0.79 0.5 5 0.8 - 1.39 1 10 1.40 - 1.89 1.5 15 >1.9 2 20 *If patient cannot take TMP/SMX, then give Dapsone 4 mg/kg (max 200 mg/dose) by mouth once per week.

Monica Gramatges, July 2011. Edited by Jeremy Slone, MD, MPH July 2013, Rachel Beaty, PharmD January 2015Preparation Guidelines for Commonly Used Chemotherapy Agents @ PMH BLEOMYCIN Formulation and Stability : Available in 15 and 30 unit vials as Bleomycin sulfate, a white or yellowish lyophilized powder. The sterile powder is stable under refrigeration . IV Infusion : Reconstitute to a concentration not to exceed 3 units/ml with normal saline and infuse over a minimum of 10 minutes (no greater than 1 unit/minute). Subcutaneous or IM: Reconstitute to a concentration of normal saline. Note : Bleomycin should notbe or diluted with containing diluents. When reconstituted in D5W, Bleomycin demonstrates a loss of A2 and B2 potency that does not occur when reconstituted in 0.9% sodium chloride. Bleomycin is stable for 24 hours at room temperature in Sodium Chloride. Special Precautions: Due to the possibility idiosyncratic reaction, the manufacturer recommends that lymphoma patients receive a test dose of 2 units or less IV, IM or subcutaneously for the first 2 doses. Following administration of the test dose, consider monitoring of vital signs every 15 minutes for at least 1 hour and if no acute reaction occurs, the full dose may be given. Practical Tips: Typically PMH supplies the 15 unit vial. Reconstitute with 5ml of NS or sterile water. It will keep for longer than 24 hours after reconstitution if kept 2-8 C but it is not clear how long. CARBOPLATIN Formulation and Stability : Available in vials (50mg, 150mg and 450mg) as a white lyophilized powder. Should be stored at room temperature and protected from light. Per package insert, stable for 8 hours at room temperature if further diluted with D5W to 0.5 mg/mL. IV Infusion: Reconstitute with 5, 15, or 45ml of sterile water, respectively, each ml containing 10mg carboplatin (see below). Carboplatin may be further diluted mg/mL with 5% dextrose or 0.9% sodium chloride with an 8 hour stability at room temperature. Infuse the diluted solution over 15-60 minutes. Avoid use of aluminum containing needles or administration sets. VIAL SIZE VOLUME OF DILUENT CONCENTRATION 50 mg 5ml 10mg/ml 150 mg 15ml 10mg/ml 450 mg 45ml 10mg/ml Practical Tips: The formulations most often supplied by PMH are 150mg/15ml or 450mg/45ml. A dose of up to 400mg can be put into a 200ml bag (2 mg/ml). Half Darrows (200ml) bags have been successfully used as a replacement when ideal diluents (NS or D5) are not available. An alternative, if available, is using a Buretrol filled with NS or D5. Usually infused over 60 minutes. CISPLATIN Formulation and Stability : Available as an aqueous solution containing 1mg/ml of cisplatin in sodium chloride (50ml, 100ml and 200 ml). Store at room temperature and do not refrigerate .Protect unopened container from light . The cisplatin remaining in the amber vial following initial entry is stable for 28 days protected from light or for 7 days under fluorescent room light. Cisplatin removed from its amber container should be protected from light if not used within 6 hours. IV Infusion: Cisplatin may be further diluted in dextrose and saline solutions provided the solution contains 0.2% sodium chloride. Dextrose/saline/mannitol containing solutions, protected from light, are stable refrigerated or at room temperature, use within 24 hours. Infuse doses 60 mg/m2/day over 1 hour and doses > 60 mg/m2/day over 1- 8 hours. Practical Tips: PMH usually provides 50mg/50ml or 10mg/10ml. The required dose is typically put in a 1 liter bag/bottle of DNS or NS. Mannitol, when available, comes in a 500ml bag that contains 200g of mannitol. Most cisplatin regimens call for 10g/m2 of mannitol. Mannitol is added to the DNS or NS bottle/bag that contains the cisplatin. Usually ran over 4-6 hours. CYTARABINE Formulation and Stability: Available in vials of 100 mg, 500 mg, 1 g, and 2 g containing a sterile powder for reconstitution. It is also available at a 20 mg/mL concentration with benzyl alcohol or as a preservative free solution, and at a 100 mg/mL concentration as preservative free solution. Store at room temperature. Cytarabine solutions should be protected from light .Prepared by M. Monica Gramatges, July 2011. Edited by Jeremy Slone, MD, MPH July 2013, Rachel Beaty, PharmD January 2015IV Infusion: Reconstitute the lyophilized for or 0.9% sodium chloride injection. When reconstituted with Bacteriostatic Water, cytarabine is stable for 48 hours at room temperature. Discard if solution appears hazy. May be further diluted with dextrose or sodium chloride containing solutions for IV infusion. May give by IV push, IV infusion, or by continuous infusion. IV Low Dose ( 200 mg/m\u00b2/dose): Reconstitute to a concentration of 20-100 mg/mL and administer over 15-30 minutes.

If administered as undiluted drug at the 20 mg/mL concentration, reconstitute with NS only to avoid a hypotonic solution. Cyclophosphamide may be further diluted in dextrose or saline containing solutions for IV use. Administer doses 500 mg/m2over 15-30 minutes; administer doses > 500 mg/m2to < 1,800 mg/m2over 30- 60 minutes; administer doses 1,800 over 1-6 hours. Selected drug interactions: Substrate of CYP2A6 (minor), Patients on inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 agents should be monitored closely for toxicity or reduced efficacy. Practical Tips: Sterile water is not available at PMH beyond 5-15 ml vials. A variety of fluids, based on availability, have been used for reconstitution including D5, NS, DNS or Half Darrows. Typically, cyclophosphamide (500mg vials) are reconstituted with 25 ml of NS (or available fluid). The volume required for the dose is diluted in a 200ml bag of Half Darrows, NS, D5, or other available fluid. Remember to remove air from vial before reconstituting. Usually ran over 60 minutes. DACARBAZINE Formulation and Stability: Lyophilized powder, 100 mg and 200 mg of DTIC per vial. Refrigerate. Protect vials from light. IV Infusion: Reconstitute with sterile water for injection (add 9.9 ml to 100 mg vial and 19.7 to 200 mg vial).Prepared by M. Monica Gramatges, July 2011. Edited by Jeremy Slone, MD, MPH July 2013, Rachel Beaty, PharmD January 2015Reconstituted vials are stable 72 hours if refrigerated or 8 hours at room temperature. If drug is further diluted, it may be stored 24 hours in refrigerator or 8 hours at room temperature. Infuse diluted solution over 15-60 minutes. Slow infusion, as needed, for burning during administration. Selected drug interactions: Dacarbazine is a major substrate for CYP1A2 and CYT2E1. Patients on CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 inhibitors or CYP1A2 inducers should be monitored closely for toxicity or reduced efficacy. Practical Tip: Rarely used in pediatric oncology. DACTINOMYCIN Practical Tips: The formulation supplied by PMH is 0.5 mg powder. It is reconstituted with 1.1 ml of sterile water, NS or available IV fluid. Can be further diluted with NS or D5. Protect from light. Per package insert, use within 4 hours of reconstitution. At PMH, given as an IV push over 5 minute following at least a 5 ml flush with NS or other available IV fluid to ensure patency of the line as dactinomycin is a strong vesicant. The dactinomycin should be followed by at least another 5 ml flush. Preferably, it can be given through the IV line with IV fluid running wide open. In the event of extravasation, infuse as much fluid as possible subcutaneously to dilute the dactinomycin and limit its toxic effects. Protect from light. **VESICANT** DOXORUBICIN Formulation and Stability: Available as red-orange lyophilized powder for injection in 10 mg, 20 mg, 50 mg, 150 mg vials and a 2 mg/mL solution in 10 mg, 20 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 200 mg vials. Aqueous Solution: Store refrigerated .Protect from light . Retain in carton until contents used. Powder for Injection: Store unreconstituted vial at room temperature. Retain in carton until contents are used. Reconstitute with preservative-free sterile water ( PMH package instructions differ from COG recs of NS ) to a final concentration of 2mg/mL . After adding the diluent, the vial should be shaken and the contents allowed to dissolve. The reconstituted solution is stable for 7 days at room temperature under normal room light and 15 days under refrigeration 2\u00b0-8\u00b0C ( PMH package instructions indicate 24 hours at room temperature and 48 hours at 2\u00b0-8\u00b0C ) Protect from exposure to sunlight . Doxorubicin may be further diluted in 0.9% NaCl or dextrose containing solutions and administered by infusion. IV Infusion: Administer IV through the tubing of rapidly infusing solution of D5W or 0.9% NaCl into a large vein. Avoid extravasation. If pushing directly into IV, flush first with 5 ml of NS, then infuse DOXO SLOWLY over 5 minutes minimum. Repeat flush with another 5 ml NS. Preferably, it can be given through the IV line with IV fluid running wide open. Selected drug interactions : DOXOrubicin is a major substrate for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and an inhibitor of CYP2B6 (moderate), CYP2D6 (weak) and CYP3A4 (weak). Patients on CYP2D6 CYP3A4 inhibitors, on CYP2B6 substrates and on CYP3A4 inducers should be monitored closely for toxicity or reduced efficacy. Practical Tips : Forms typically available at PMH include 50mg powder, 50mg/25 ml and 10mg/5 ml solutions. Typically reconstituted with normal saline depending on fluid availability. Check the package insert for the 50 mg powder to determine appropriate storage time and discard accordingly. To avoid painful infusion and to lessen the risk of extravasation injury, doxorubicin is typically infused through the IV tubing with IV fluids running wide open. In the event of extravasation, infuse as much fluid as possible subcutaneously to dilute the doxorubicin and limit its toxic effects. **VESICANT** ETOPOSIDE Formulation and Stability : Available in sterile multiple dose vials. Store at room temperature. IV Infusion: Dilute Etoposide to a final concentration <0.4 mg/mL or Normal Saline containing IV solutions. Etoposide infusions are stable at room temperature for 96 hours when diluted to concentrations of 0.2mg/ml; stability is 24 hours at room temperature with concentrations of 0.4mg/mL. The time to precipitation is highly unpredictable at concentrations > 0.4mg/mL. IV standard dose ( 200 mg/m2): Infuse diluted solution (concentration 0.4 mg/mL) over at least 60-120 minutes; slow rate of administration if hypotension occurs. Rate should not exceed 300 mg/m2/hour (10 mg/kg/hour). The use of an in-line filter during the infusion is suggested. IV intermediate and high dose: Infuse as a maximum rate of 300 mg/m2/hour (10 mg/kg/hour). Fluid volumes may be prohibitive at 0.4 mg/mL concentration; an alternative dilution of 0.6 mg/mL (8 hour stability) may be used. For concentrations > 0.4 mg/mL, use an in-line filter during infusions secondary to precipitate formation risk. Donot administer etoposide by rapid intravenous injection. To avoid leaching of DEHP from PVC bags and tubing, prepare the Etoposide solution as close as possible preferably within 4 hours to the time of administration.Prepared by M. Monica Gramatges, July 2011. Edited by Jeremy Slone, MD, MPH July 2013, Rachel Beaty, PharmD January 2015Suggested drug interactions : Etoposide is a substrate for CYP1A2 (minor), CYP2E1 (minor) and CYP3A4 (major). It inhibits CYP2C9 (weak) and CYP3A4 (weak). Patients on CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors should be monitored closely for toxicity or reduced efficacy. Practical Tips: Typically available in 100mg/5ml vials. Etoposide can be diluted in a 200ml bag (Half Darrows, NS, D5 \u00bc NS often available) up to 80mg per 200ml bag (0.4 mg/ml). A patient's dose can be divided into two 200ml bags to give the dose at the appropriate dilution. Usually ran over 60 minutes. 5-FLUOROURACIL Formation and Stability: Dilution not required for administration. May dilute in 50-1000 mL NS or D5W for infusion. When transferring the fluorouracil solution from a pharmacy bulk vial, the contents must be transferred within 4 hours after puncturing the vial. The vial should only be punctured 1 time. Additionally, the transferred drug solution should be administered within 4 hours. Do not refrigerate or freeze. Protect from light. IV push or short infusion: Fluorouracil may be administered undiluted (50 mg/mL) or diluted by IV push or by short infusion over 3-15 minutes. IV continuous infusion: The diluted solution can be infused over 24 hours or as multi-day continuous infusion. Practical tips: In the absence of IV pumps and large volume fluids, an option to consider for 24 hour infusion would be to split the dose into two 1 L bags/bottles and infuse at 85 ml/hr on the Diaflow. METHOTREXATE Formulation and stability: Available as a lyophilized powder for injection in 20 mg and 1 g vials or as a 25 mg/mL solution in 2, 4, 8, 10, 20 and 40 mL. Sterile methotrexate powder or solution is stable at room temperature. Protect from light. IV Infusion (low dose (Capizzi) only, PMH unable to monitor excretion for ID/HD MTX): Powder for injection: Dilute of Dextrose 5% in Water or Sodium Chloride Injection for a 50 mg/mL concentration. Dilute the 20 mg vial to a concentration 25 mg/mLwith above diluents. The powder for injection may be further diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride or dextrose containing solutions to a concentration of < 25 mg/mL for IV use. The 25 mg/mL solution may be further diluted in saline or dextrose containing solutions for IV use. Do not use the preserved solution due to the risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity. Methotrexate dilutions should be used within 24 hours and protected from light. IV push: Undiluted: Inject over 2-5 minutes. Diluted: Infuse the diluted solution over 10-15 minutes. Intrathecal : Use preservative free 25 mg/mL solution or 20 mg lyophilized powder for injection For intrathecal administration, dilute with Injection, lactated Ringer's or Elliot's B solution, or as per institutional standard of practice. The volume of CSF removed should be equal to at least half the volume delivered. Selected drug interactions: Avoid NSAIDS, TMP/SMX, penicillins, probenicid, IV fosphenytoin. Practical Tips: PMH supplies 50mg/2ml solution kept at room temperature. For IT use, the dose is drawn into a 5 ml syringe and further diluted with NS to fill the syringe. For IV use, the dose is drawn into a 20 ml and further diluted with NS or other available fluid to fill the syringe. This is given as an IV push directly into the cannula or infused via the IV line with fluids running wide open.

An inline 0.22 micron filter should be used during administration. IV (Dose > 90 mg/m2/dose): Infuse over 3 hours using non-PVC containers and administration set. An inline 0.22 micron filter should be used during administration. Suggested premedications : Premedicate patients with a corticosteroid 12 and 6 hours or 30-60 minutes 30-60 minutes prior to paclitaxel administration. Selected drug interactions : Paclitaxel is a substrate for CYP3A4 (major) and CYP2C8 (major) and an inducer of CYP3A4 (weak). Patients on inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 agents should be monitored closely for reduced level/efficacy of paclitaxel. CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 inhibitors Practical Tips: PMH provides 100mg/16.7ml (6mg/ml) in ethanol solution. This must be diluted to 0.3-1.2 mg/ml using NS, D5, DNS, or RL. After dilution, stable at room temperature for 27 hours. Premedicate with dexamethasone 12 hours and again 30 minutes before dose as well as antihistamines (ranitidine + promethazine/chlorphoneramine/diphenhydramine) 30 minutes before infusion. Infuse over 3 hours due to risk for anaphylaxis. VINBLASTINE Formulation and Stability: Lyophilized powder, 10 mg per vial. Refrigerate. Protect from light. Unused portions of the remaining solutions made with normal saline that do not contain preservatives should be discarded immediately. Unused preservative-containing solutions made with normal saline may be stored in a refrigerator for future use for a maximum of 28 days. IV Infusion: Reconstitute each vial with bacteriostatic NS, to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Stable for 9 days after reconstitution if refrigerated. IV push: Administer the reconstituted solution (1 mg/mL) over 1 minute Selected drug interactions : VinBLAStine is a substrate of CYP3A4 (major) and CYP2D6 (minor) and an inhibitor of CYP3A4 (weak) and CYP2D6 (weak). CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the level/effects of vinBLAStine CY3P3A4 inducers may decrease the levels/effects of vinblastine. VINCRISTINE Formulation and Stability : Available in vials containing one mg vincristine sulfate and sterile water for injection. Store refrigerated. Protect from light and retain in carton until time of use. Do not mix with any IV solutions other than those containing dextrose or saline. Per package insert, stable for 12 hours at room temperature. IV Infusion: Injection of vincristine sulfate should be accomplished within 1 minute. Vincristine sulfate must be administered via an intact, free-flowing intravenous needle or catheter . Care should be taken to ensure that the needle or catheter is securely within the vein to avoid extravasation during administration. The solution may be injected either directly into a vein or into the tubing of a running intravenous infusion. Fatal if given intrathecally . Selected drug interactions : VinCRIStine is a substrate of CYP3A4 (major) and an inhibitor of CYP3A4 (weak). CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the level/effects of vinCRIStine. Practical Tips: At PMH, given as an IV push over 1 minute following at least a 5 ml flush with NS or other available IV fluid to ensure patency of the line as vincristine is a strong vesicant. The vincristine should be followed by at least another 5 ml flush. Preferably, it can be given through the IV line with IV fluid running wide open. In the event of extravasation, infuse as much fluid as possible subcutaneously to dilute the vincristine and limit its toxic effects. **VESICANT** Prepared using resources available through the Children's Oncology Group by: M Monica Gramatges, MD Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, Cancer and Hematology Service Texas Children's Hospital Updated (added dactinomycin and paclitaxel) and practical tips based on experience and availability at PMH by: Jeremy Slone, MD, MPHBaylor College of Medicine/Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers Princess Marina Hospital Updated using resources available through the Children's Oncology Group and medication package inserts by: Rachel Beaty, PharmD Clinical Pharmacy Specialist, Hematology Department of Pharmacy Texas Children's HospitalAppendix L- Chemotherapy PHO)Princess & Oncology CHEMOTHERAPY PLAN ***Place in patient's chart after Drug Sheet patient is admitted.*** Rev 01.13.2014Patient's Name: Labs (To be Obtained Before PPLLAACCEECCAANNNNUULLAAAANNDDLLEEAAVVEEIITTIINN!!!!!!!!
