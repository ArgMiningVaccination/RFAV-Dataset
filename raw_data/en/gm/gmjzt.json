Introduction Ayurveda serves two objectives like all other health systems. Its first and primary objective is to preserve and maintain the health of healthy people, and the second is to cure the diseased ones. The medicines by which patients are cured are of two types, substance mediated and nonsubstance mediated. The substance mediated therapy includes all solid and visible medications that are used to cure a disease. Nonsubstance mediated does not comprise any material medicament but numerous other ways such as Sun, Yoga, Fasting, Pranayama, and Meditation. These have not direct impact on the disease but they indirectly affect the overall health of a person physical as well as mental. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an auto-immune disease affecting the brain and spinal cord. This is a highly dreadful and disabling disorder resulting from demyelination of nerve cells interrupting the connectivity between nerves and muscles thereby making muscles paralyzed, and then, nonfunctional for the period till myelin sheath of nerve cells is regenerated. As far as the management of MS is concerned, there is no any specific line of management for the disease other than immunosuppression because of enhanced fatal activity of deformed immunity resulting in the repeated fatal attacks of one's own antibodies and thereby hazardous clinical manifestations. In such morbid conditions, only laws of nature and true devotion works. In such cases of disease where cause is unknown and cannot be rationalized with pathology, in Ayurveda, spiritual therapy is mentioned including mantra chanting, religious ceremonies, auspicious offerings, obedient attitude to the Gods, and visiting pilgrims. There is clear mention of the absolute eradication of miseries by the elimination of materialistic desires which is assisted by mind control through psychic therapy. Besides, there is description of mind control by psychic therapy distracting the mind from harmful objects. Spiritual Management for Spiritual Healing It means that the number of existent substances which constitute the universe is also part of the body. Therefore, the universe and human body are alike and replica of each other. This body is an amazing galaxy like the Universe consisting of stars, planets, and all the similar constituents. In other words we can say that both are alike in constitution as well as Energy. Both are governed by similar forces of the Sun, the Moon, and the Air. According to science of Ayurveda, principles of evolution and creation are derived from nature. We can say two types of creation by supreme god, macrocosm (whole universe), and microcosm (living body). Entire universe and human body are governed by two types of energies. One is positive and another is negative with whom universe and body are influenced with positive and negative effects, respectively. We can say two types of creation by supreme god. The principles create and maintain universe and living body is also created and maintained by the same principles. Surrounding environmental vibes affect the physical and psychic setup of living beings. Vitals of a life Vital means basic components and necessities of body to sustain life. They are as following: Spiritual food ingestion Food is the elementary and most primordial requirement of a person to sustain life which keeps on life moving and body growing every second. Food or diet is termed as Prana of a living being in Ayurveda. We generally screen our food on the basis of wholesome (healthy) and unwholesome (unhealthy). We opt for wholesome diet to sustain our health and reject unwholesome diet to prevent diseases. However, there is other aspect of the food we eat that is spiritual eating. Like before eating when food placed before you, close your eyes and concentrate completely focused on some divine energy of god or some godly person who is full of such divine energy and assume that your food is being radiated by a beam of light full of nectar - the life essence a peculiar characteristic of some deity and this nectar is going to alleviate your illness and filling with tremendous super divine energy. Spiritual breathing Breathing is an inevitable and involuntary phenomenon of life that is the greatest gift of almighty to all living beings, which continuously enriches the life with breaths every moment of life. It is so much involuntary act of life that we take it for granted. We all know that actually this is phenomenon of cleansing our body in an uninterrupted way by energizing through oxygenation and eliminating carbon dioxide from our body. This process keeps on even to a child or person who does not know this fact irrespective of age, gender, or mental condition and gives the similar results of oxygenation and detoxification to everyone equally whether a poor or rich, a child or aged, and healthy or diseased. There is one another perspective of breathing that we can name spiritual breathing. In this kind of specific divine breathing, we voluntarily breath in positive energy we can assume golden beam of energy being inhaled with an imagination that this is going to heal my body my lesions produced by demyelination of nerve cells, my paralyzed body parts, weakness of my limbs. On the parallel way with exhalation assume that a dark blackish beam of negative energy is coming out of your body which is expelling all sickness, all feebleness, and all weakness out of your body. This spiritual breathing works so miraculously that no medicine can do. We can do this by simple breathing or by Pranayaam (controlled breathing). Concept is similar in both the cases. Generating awareness during breathing to make it impulsive to voluntarily inhale positive energy (health) and exhale negative energy (illness). This is going to heal body promptly and effectively with positive results. Meditation There is number of techniques mentioned in different spiritual texts and demonstrated by enlightened Gurus, Saints, and Maharishis (the great sages). Method 1 First of all sit or lie down in a comfortable posture in a quiet place and then assume yourself being surrounded by a thick cloud of divine aura or you can say energy of almighty, a highly enlightened person, a deity or to whom you have full faith, devotion, and trust. Now just imagine his never-ending immortal energy, feel like his superpower energy is entering your body and has covered you all around. That supreme energy is penetrating deep in your body and energizing every cell, every tissue, and every organ. All body is being drenched in the blissful shower of that supreme energy which is filling your body with positivity of wellness, being healthy and joyful. On the same way, alleviation of illness, sickness, and weakness by this supreme energy are happening all around. Method 2 There is description of shat chakras (six wheels) in the human body those have got much higher place in the spiritual growth and are considered as high-energy wheels. We do not have to consider all chakras, but in my point of view, think and work with Agya chakra also known as the third eye. Your most favorite, adorable, and trustworthy source of tremendous energy God or a deity has to be seated in Agya chakra. Sitting or lying down in a comfortable posture now assume that your specific God, Goddess, any deity of your faith, and trust are radiating a great pious aura of light and energy that is going to heal your sickness, disability, and agony. Concentrate for longer period of time on body parts experiencing more weakness or spasticity assuming that this supreme energy is definitely going to heal this ailment. Method 3 This is the combination of above-mentioned both methods. You have to assume that you are sitting in the central part of that divine aura, and some deity is situated in your Agya chakra radiating highly potent divine energy. Both external and internal body are soaked in that immortal energy with the assumption that \"I am going to be healed with this super power.\" Method 4 This is the old technique of meditation named Vipassana demonstrated by the Great Mahatma Buddha. In Vipassana, sit or lie down in a comfortable position and have to watch what is happening in the body as a witness without involving in the emotions of pain, uneasiness, discomfort, or pleasure assuming that everything in this world is temporary, mortal, and nothing to stay long not even my illness and weakness. Just have to watch and ignore to develop a witness vision and not sufferer. Method 5 Whenever you sit in the company of some enlightened Guru or a Saint, sit quietly closing your eyes without uttering single word, without asking any question completely concentrating on his super energy start inhaling the holy air expired by him during his act of respiration just assuming his pious golden particles coming out from his nostrils and captured by your nostrils to inhale them your inside. You are connected to him and taking in his divine energy interior to your body. Method 6 This includes the chanting the name of some God such as Shiva, Rama, or Krishna. It could be a mantra or hymen given by someone's Guru. Repeated chanting of this mantra gives strength to the body and mind and eliminates depression, anxiety, and pain by distracting the mind from illness to positivity of mantra. This mantra chanting is also described in Ayurveda in different contexts. All these meditations or chanting are more effective when performed before sleep in the night. It is supposed that this keeps on even in sleep. Discussion This kind of management is such a beautiful and eternal aspect of human life that inner self always craves for the past many lives. From the time of birth till death, man is always entangled in the web of material desires and mostly thought himself creator of all his destiny. He forgets the real creator residing within himself and operating the life of all creatures. He usually thinks himself most capable living being who has laid down a wonderful medical world and continuously defeating death. However, MS like autoimmune diseases has shown him the mirror and his actual place on earth. This spiritual management is the greatest boon of almighty by assuring that all the ways of materials are closed, one single divine door is open giving all solutions to your problems increasing faith and devotional surrender to God acknowledging god every breath every moment. I feel this disease the greatest blessing in disguise when you get extremely connected in every second of your life like you live with god, eat with god, talk with God, and above all grow with god. God becomes your strongest companion and most reliable shelter. Conclusion As we move from top to bottom, we see a chain of changes from negativity to positivity, from uncertainty to divinity, from pain to pleasure, continuously being more connected to almighty with acceptance to his decisions not complaining and crying but happily moving with God, living with almighty. Thereby, life gets a meaningful purpose within pain, the orientation to ultimate salvation. There is definitely a journey from disease to ease, from discomfort to comfort. When all doors are closed then certainly one superpower welcomes you with arms open to take you inside his embrace, but trust and complete surrender are the keys to open this marvelous magnetic door. These are definitely most potent tools to get into an amazingly wonderful world of almighty, so cool and peaceful. Do not worry, a real life a true journey has started under God's umbrella.
