We are given the gift of time every day, but we never seem to have enough of it. There is a saying, that goes thus: 'Time is immortal and time was here before us and will be there long after us'. Nobody can ever change or stop time. This means that we cannot manage time, but we can align ourselves with time to achieve a healthier mind, body, and spirit. Ancient [Ayurveda](https://sunshineayurveda.com.au/what-is-ayurveda/) wisdom teaches us to follow a daily schedule of eating, sleeping, digesting our food, working, and exercising in accordance with natural doshic rhythms in order to achieve optimal health. What is an Ayurvedic Clock? Ayurveda believes that there is an 'energy clock', that is, our levels of energy are in synch with time and there is an optimal time of day for different activities. The concept of the Ayurvedic Clock is similar to that of the biological clock or body clock. It is linked to how our body and mind function relative to both the surrounding energy and the state of our bodily humors (doshas). The closer our daily rhythms are aligned with the rhythm of nature, the closer we are to achieving mind-body balance and wellness. If we go against the natural cycle of nature, we experience imbalance and deterioration of our health. How does the Dosha Clock work? In the Ayurvedic Dosha Clock, the day is split into six 4-hour periods. Each period is related to a specific dosha and it is repeated twice in a 24 hour period. |Kapha time||6AM - 10AM / 2PM - 6PM| - The rising (dawn) and falling (dusk) of the sun are connected to Kapha. - The peak of the day (midday) and the peak of the night (midnight) are related to Pitta. - The transition between night and day and between dusk and dawn is related to Vata. The activities you perform within these hours should be related to the respective dosha of that time. By aligning your activities with the proper dosha you will be more efficient at whatever you do because you will be working within your own nature. Activities for Vata time Vata dosha includes the elements of ether and air. This time is the best time to access the ether and spiritual connections. Morning 2 AM - 6 AM - After 2 AM, our sleep gets lighter and our body starts to prepare itself for the elimination process. - Brahma muhurta, 96 minutes before sunrise, is the best time to wake up. Brahma means knowledge and this is the time to seek knowledge. - This is the auspicious and sacred time, the best time to meditate, visualize, and create. - It is also the ideal time to go out for a walk and do yoga. Afternoon 2 PM - 6 PM This is a good time for communicating, socializing, and sharing creativity. - Dusk is also another good time for meditation and exercise. - Plan to have your last meal of the day before 6 PM. Activities for Pitta time Pitta dosha includes the fire and water elements, and Pitta time is the most productive part of the day. Day 10 AM - 2 PM - This is the time when our digestive fire starts to grow, and it peaks at 12 PM. The heaviest meal of the day should be taken in this window. - Pitta time is for planning, taking action, and organizing. - Schedule your most physical or analytical tasks during the Pitta daylight hours. Night 10 PM - 2 AM - This is the time that we should spend in bed so that the body can repair itself. Ayurveda suggests going to bed before 10 PM. Levels of relaxing hormones such as serotonin and melatonin start to gradually fall from 10 PM onwards. - This is the time when our mind is in a subconscious state, and when we experience colorful dreams. Activities for Kapha time Kapha dosha comprises earth and water elements. Kapha nature is heavy and nourishment and Kapha time is a perfect time for self-care rituals. Morning 6 AM - 10 AM - We should be awake in the Kapha hours so as to draw prana (life force) into the body. - Aim to complete elimination in the Kapha hour. - It is time to move very slowly by performing gentle warming exercises. - Have a light breakfast, gather energy for the day, and prepare your whole day's schedule at that time. Evening 6 PM - 10 PM - This is the hour to slow down and assimilate your energy. - It is a time that you should devote to your family and your loved ones. - Prepare your body for it to go within (get grounded), and prepare to enter a rest and repair mode. - A warm oil massage (Abhyanga) also adds to a feeling of heaviness that will relax your body and senses, and help you achieve deep rest. - Turn off your screens and reach for a relaxing book before 9:00 PM at the latest. Knowledge of this Ayurvedic routine has been around for thousands of years and it has been passed down through the sciences of yoga and Ayurveda. However, our modern lifestyle has made it difficult for us to comply with natural rhythms. These rhythms are not rules invented by Ayurveda, they are the basic needs of our body and mind. By understanding your dosha and how it functions, you can better understand how the energy around you affects your constitution and inner being.
