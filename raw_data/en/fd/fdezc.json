You may also wear a surgical mask to trap droplets that might infect others. - While you're sick, stay away from people who are in high-risk groups for infection and complications, such as people who are 65 and older, babies, children, pregnant women, and people who are taking medication to suppress their immune system. - 2 [Take your temperature](/Take-a-Temperature)to see if you have a fever.

If you see that someone is coughing or they tell you they've been sick, kindly and respectfully move away from them. Additionally, try to avoid the following methods of transmission: [[36]](#_note-36)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - Having close personal contact with an infected person, such as hugging, kissing, shaking hands, or being close to them for a long period of time (e.g., sitting next to them on a bus or plane) - Sharing cups, utensils, or personal items with an infected person - Touching your eyes, nose, or mouth after touching an infected person - Having contact with infected fecal matter (for example, if you changed the diaper of an infected baby or toddler). - 8Cover your mouth whenever you cough and sneeze.

This way, you're less likely to spread the virus around when you touch things. - 9Practice good hygiene around animals. While animals seem unlikely to be able to spread coronavirus to humans, this is still a possibility and there are a few known cases of animals contracting the virus from humans. If you come into contact with animals of any kind, including pets, always wash your hands carefully.

If you think you might have COVID-19, call your doctor right away so they can determine if you should be tested. If you're having breathing problems, get emergency medical care. Since COVID-19 is a viral infection, antibiotics can't treat it, and currently there's no cure. If you test positive for COVID-19, the best thing you can do is stay home and rest until your doctor says you're infection-free. In the meantime, take over-the-counter medications to help with your pain and fever, like acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen. Remember to drink plenty of fluids so you don't get dehydrated, and try to eat foods that are easy to digest, like soup or toast. You can also take hot showers and use a humidifier to help with your cough. If at any point you develop severe symptoms, like difficulty breathing or pain and pressure in your chest, get emergency care. Once you start feeling better, talk to your doctor about when it's safe for you to leave your home.
