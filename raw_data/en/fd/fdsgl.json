PERMISSION TO PAPER ................................ ................................ ................................ . ................................ ................................ ............................... 61 4 | P a g e PURPOSE OF THE GUIDE This guide is designed to provide graduate students in the Department of Political Science at Purdue University with guidance in developing and carrying out an advanced program of study. It includes summaries of the requirements, procedures, and policies for the various fields of study and degree programs offered by the department. The Department of Political Science offers a graduate program leading to a Doctor of Philosophy degree. Students who ente r without a master's degree are encouraged to complete their Master of Arts degree in Political Science as part of their progress toward the doctoral degree. The program is designed to prepare students for faculty positions in a college or university and n on-academic positions that draw upon the skills and experiences gained in the program. Graduates of the program have secured careers in academia and in public and private sector settings, including in local, state , or national government, non - profit agencies, think -tanks, non -governmental organizations, and private companies. Important In carrying out its program, the Department of Political Science operates under the rules, regulations, and policies of the Purdue Graduate School and Purdue University. Students should familiarize themselves with the Graduate School Catalog and University polic ies, as many University and Graduate School requirements are not repeated here. Among other things, the Graduate School Catalog (aka Policies and Procedures for Administering Graduate Student Programs) details registration rules, academic standards, examination and graduation requirements, and leaves of absence. ( http://catalog.purdue.edu/ ). All graduate students employed through the department are subject to the Graduate Staff Employment Manual . (www.purdue.edu/policies/human -resources/vif11.html ). The Ph.D. program was revised substantially in 2021. For students who are operating under the former system, please refer to older versions of this guide. Students who entered prior to fall 2021 and wish to change their Plan of Study described in 2021 Guide may elect to do so by completing the form available upon request from the Academic Program Manager . At the department level, the program is administered by a Dir ector of Graduate Studies (DGS) and an Associate Director of Graduate Studies , who, in consultation with the Department Head, oversees all aspects of the program. A Graduate Studies Committee (GSC), made up of department faculty, makes recommendations for policies, reviews student progress, and makes rulings on student petitions. The Graduate Studies Committee includes a sub -committee on Diversity , Inclusion and Belonging , and a sub - committee on Recruitment and Admissions. Administrative support for the program is provided by the Academic Program Manager and Department Operations Manager who assist with day -to-day administrative tasks and serve as liaisons to the business offices, and the Graduate School. These administrative roles rotate , and current information about who holds each role can be found on the Department's webpage.

Purdue University Academic Freedom Polic y Policy I.A.4 states \" Purdue University is committed to fostering a community where scholarship, research and creative expression thrive. Academic freedom is fundamental to the pursuit of knowledge because it encourages open discourse, inquiry and debate among faculty and students. Distinct from academic freedom, the Unive rsity recognizes and upholds the rights and protections guaranteed under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, as more fully embodied in its Commitment to Freedom of Expre ssion . Faculty, lecturers, instructors, researchers and students have full freedom as researchers, scholars and artists, and are assured freedom to communicate their work, to advocate solutions to human problems and to criticize existing institutions. This freedom is subject only to adequate performance of their academic duties and to obligations they may have voluntarily assumed in accepting support for their scholarly work or research. It should be recognized that resea rch activities are also subject to state and federal laws and regulations and to University policies and procedures, including but not limited to Intellectual Property (I.A.1 ), Export Controls and OFAC Regulations (I.A.2) , Research Misconduct (III.A.2) and those designed to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects. Faculty, lecturers and instructors have freedom in the classroom in discussing their subject matter. They also have the responsibility to avoid infringing upon their students' right to learn by introducing irrelevant subject matter. \" The full policy is located here: https://www.purdue.edu/policies/academic -research - affairs/ia4.html GRADUATE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATI ON 6 | P a g e The Director of Graduate Studies (DGS) oversees the day-to-day operations of the graduate program and makes recommendations to the department Head . The DGS ensures alignment of the program with department goals and policies, provides advice and guidance to faculty and graduate students on program requirements and student progress, engages in strategic program planning and initiatives, and ensures compliance with department, college, and university graduate policies. The Associate Director of Grad uate Studies (ADG S) oversees graduate recruitment and admissions and serves as chair of the admissions subcommittee of the Graduate Committee , and makes admissions recommendations to the DGS and Department Head . The ADGS also serves as the department's Placement Coordinator and assists with graduate professional development. The Graduate Coordinator(s) (GC) include the Department Operations Manager and the Academic Program Manager who assist the DH, DGS, ADGS, faculty, and students with day-to-day operations of the program, particularly the administrative and business requirements associated with the program. The Academic Program Manager assists with academic and curricular aspects of the program, and compliance with academic policy. The Department Operations Manager assists with business and employment aspects of the graduate program, space management, and general policy compliance. The Graduate Coordinator (s) serves as a liaison s to department's Graduate Studies Committee, the Political Science Graduate Student Association, faculty, the graduate school, the business office and other entities on campus associated with graduate education . The Graduate Studies Committee (GSC) includes both faculty and graduate student members appointed by th e Department Head and is chaired by the Director of Graduate Studies. Its responsibilities include: (a) recommending changes in the graduate curriculum and program to the faculty; (b) the general administration of the graduate program; (c) receipt and cons ideration of petitions for variances from the provisions in the Guide to Graduate Study. The Graduate Diversity , Inclusion and Belongingness subcommittee of the Graduate Studies Committee is charged with keeping up to date with policies at the university related to the committee charge and ensuring that department policies are carried out in the manner that is consistent with university policies. The committee plays a key role in meeting department goals of providing a safe and welcoming environ ment for all graduate students . They identify and/or plan workshops or training to addressing sexual harassment and violence, combat bias and other forms of discrimination , help to create and maintain an improved climate, and support department efforts to create an inclusive environment that fosters a sense of belonging among all graduate students . The Graduate Admissions and Recruitment Subcommittee of the Graduate Studies Committee is responsible for reviewing and recommending applicants for admissions and funding packages , and making nominations for fellowships for newly admitted students. The Graduate Admissions and Recruitment Subcommittee also takes major responsibility for coordinating recruitment efforts, including planning and conducting a campus visit in late February for prospective students. FIELDS OF STUDY IN POLITICAL SCIENCE Graduate students select a major field of study and a minor field of study. The graduate curriculum is divided into five areas of specialization from which the student may choose their major and minor field 7 | P a g e concentrations: (1) American Politics, (2) Compar ative Politics, (3) International Relations, (4) Public Policy, (5) Research Methodology (minor field only). Students may select any of the first four fields as a major field, and any of the five as a minor field. The most current information about the research focus of each field and the affiliated faculty may be found on the Department's website: https://cla.purdue.edu/academic/polsci/research/research -areas/index.html Important Plan of Study Note: Students pursuing a minor field in Political Methodolog y must take two elective classes at the 600 level or above in one of the core political science fields of American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, or Public Policy. Customized Disciplinary, Interdisciplinary, or Outside Minor Field s Students can petition to pursue a minor in a field outside of political science or construct a specialized topic minor field within political science or spanning political science and other disciplines. A customized minor requires a minimum of 9 hours and a mechanism for assessing knowledge in the minor field through an examination committee. A customized minor must be approved by the student's major advisor. In addition, a political science faculty member must be designated as the student's advisor for the customized minor and organize the qualifying exam for the minor field. Customized minors, including any changes, must be approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. For approval, the student must submit the list of proposed courses, a brief statement explaining/justifying the proposed minor, a statement of the examination procedures for the qualifying exam, and a signed agreement with the political science faculty member who will supervise the customized minor along with a signed agreement from a minimum of three committee members who will grade the qualifying exam in the customized minor field. The petition must be submitted to the Director of Graduate Studies and reviewed and approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. Specified minor fields for ESE, Political Economy, and Political Psychology Students admitted as part of the Ecological Sciences and Engineering (ESE) program will choose ESE as their minor field. Students pursuing an MS in psychol ogical sciences or economics (see Appendix G) will choose either psychological sciences or economics as their minor field. Students pursuing minor fields in ESE, political economy or political psychology need to have a political science faculty member as their minor field advisor on the student's Ph.D. Plan of Study. Students must also identify a psychology or economics faculty member to serve on their Ph.D. Doctorial Advisory Committee. Important Plan of Study Note: Students pursuing a customized minor field must take two elective classes at the 600 level or above in one of the core political science fields of American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, or Public Policy. Political Science as a Minor Field for Students in Other Departments or Programs Courses to satisfy a minor field requirement for M.A. or Ph.D. students from other departments may be drawn from one or more fields of study in political science in accordance with the interests of the student and the recommen dation of the student 's Advisory Committee member from political science. M.A. Level - For political science to constitute a minor field for a student from another department, the student should take six to nine hours of graduate level courses in political science, including at least one 600 -level course. 8 | P a g e Ph.D. Level - If political science is a minor field for a student from another department, the student should take nine to twelve hours of graduate level courses in political science, including at least one 600-level course. PH.D. PROGRAM Introduction All incoming graduate students shall be admitted directly to the Ph.D. program. According to the Graduate School, a master's degree or professional doctoral degree from any accredited institution may be considered to contribute up to 30 credit hours toward satisfying Ph.D. requirements at the discretion of the Graduate Studies Committee. Transfer credits from other institutions are not normally accepted to fulfill core requirements in t he program or in fulfillment of specified course requirements in any major or minor field. Students seeking to transfer credits from another institution must petition the Graduate Studies Committee by the end of the second semester of their first year in t he program. Although the department (through the Graduate Director and Academic Program Manager ) will make every effort to monitor deadlines for individual students, the ultimate responsibility for observing all deadlines for completion of the Ph.D. requirements lie with the student, in consultation with the student's committee chair. These deadlines are subject to change depending on whether the student plans to graduate in the spring, summer, or fall semester. In unusual circumstances, students may need to request a variance from program requirements or extend the timeline established for satisfactory progress. Students who are interested in requesting a variance should seek the approval of their faculty advisors first. A petition is then submitted t o the Director of Graduate Studies who will determine the approvals required for the requested variance. The DGS and the Graduate Studies Committee will act on routine petitions. Extraordinary variances will be considered by the DGS, the Graduate Studies Committee, the Department Head, and, if appropriate or required, administrators in the College of Liberal Arts and/ or the Graduate School. Some variances require Human Resources Approval and/or full departmental faculty review for final action. 9 | P a g e Normally, students enrolled in the graduate program are expected to enroll in 9 hours per semester of course work continuously until they complete their degrees. If a student is not enrolled in classes or dissertation research credits for three or more semesters, including summers, the student will be required to re -apply to the graduate program. Further, if more than eight semesters elapse between passing preliminary examinations and the dissertation defense, students must retake the prelimin ary exams unless granted an exception. The Graduate Studies Committee may , under rare circumstances, grant an exception if satisfactory progress has been made and extenuating circumstances have prevented completion within the specified period of time. English Language Proficiency Students are expected to work toward satisfying the requirement without delay. All beginning students for whom English is not their primary language, and who have not demonstrated proficiency through one of the Graduate School approved mechanisms , must: Take the examinations administered by the Oral English Proficiency Program at Purdue at the earliest available date. This examination is scheduled by the Academic Program Manager ; and complete any recommended courses and a dditional testing necessary to receive certification. The Oral English Proficiency Test (OEPT) Tutorial website can be accessed from the Oral English Proficiency Program's website, http://tutorial.ace -in-testing.com/Default.aspx?p=videos . Students required to take the OEPT are strongly encouraged to utilize the tutorial website, which includes practice exams, to prepare for their test. Major Advisor By the end of the student's second semester in residence, the student, with the assistance of the Director of Graduate Studies, shall select an advisor from the faculty in the student's major field. An advisor is also referred to as the student's major professor or major advisor . This faculty advisor shall be the chairperson of the student's Ph.D. Advisory Committee. The Director of Graduate Studies will serve as students' de facto advisor until their major advisor is selected. Students may change advisors should their field or research interests change. A change in the major advisor requires approval of the DGS and a change in the Plan of Study. Please consult the Academic Program Manager for assistance for Plan of Study changes. 10 | P a g e Ph.D. Advisory Committee With the assistance of the major advisor, the student shall also select committee members from the major and minor field. If the minor field is a customized minor field, the minor field committee member must be the member who has agreed to supervise the minor field coursework and qualifying exams. a. Any customized minor field must be approved by the student's major advisor. A customized minor must consist of at least 9 graduate -level credit hours that are organized around some common conceptual theme. Customized minors, including any changes, must be approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. For approval, the student must submit the list of proposed courses, a brief statement explaining/justifying the proposed minor, a statement of the examination procedures for the qualifying exam, and a signed agreement with the political science faculty member who will super vise the customized minor along with a signed agreement from a minimum of three committee members who will grade the qualifying exam in the customized minor field. The petition must be submitted to the Director of Graduate Studies and reviewed and approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. b. With the advice of the student's Ph.D. Advisory Committee, each student shall prepare a Plan of Study. This must be completed by the end of their second semester, and preferably by the end of their first semester. A Plan of Study is an official document in which the student proposes the courses the student will take to qualify for their degree. The student accesses, completes, and submits their Plan of Study through their MyPurdue portal. The Plan of Study should be reviewed and updated as needed as committee members and course offerings change. Changes require approval from the Political Science Department's Director of Graduate Studies and the student's major advisor. Students may not take the comprehens ive written exams until the Plan of Study has been submitted to the Graduate School. In addition, the student cannot graduate unless an updated Plan of Study has been submitted and approved. Check the Graduate School website for details: https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/faculty/forms.html Core Courses The PhD is a research -based degree. All students must complete a core set of 15 credit hours of research scope and methods courses to prepare them to execute high -quality research in their subject matter areas. A minimum of a B - in any individual course is required, and an overall GPA in all core courses of 3.0 or higher in all courses except POL60900 is required to progress to qualifying exams. These courses may not count toward fulfilling requirements of a majo r or minor field. POL 60000 - Political Science Scope and Design POL 50100 - Introduction to Political Analysis POL 60500 - Advanced Political Analysis POL 60800 - Qualitative Methods for Political Analysis POL 60900 - Advanced Research Design (completed after qualifying exams)11 | P a g e Additional Credit Hours Graduate students must complete an additional 39 credit hours of graduate courses. This includes at least 12 hours in a major field, 9 hours in a minor field, 9 hours of electives, and 9 hours of Professional Training Practicums. This will result in a total of at least 45 graded credit hours, up to 9 hours of pass/no pass practicum credits, for a total of 54 credit hours. All graded courses must be listed on the Plan of St udy. To summarize: 1. 12 of these credit hours must be in a major field of political science (i.e., AP, CP, IR, PP). 2. 9 of these credit hours must be in a minor field of political science (i.e., AP, CP, IR, PP, PRM or an approved customized minor field). 3. 9 of these credit hours are elective credits selected in consultation with the major advisor to complement the student's program of study and career goals. These may be taken inside or outside the department with the following exception: Students m inoring in Political Research Methodology or a customized minor with more than 6 credits taken outside of the Political Science department must use 6 elective credits to take coursework in one of the major fields (AP, CP, IR, PP), unless the Graduate Studies Committee and Graduate Advisor approve a petition for an exception to this rule. 4. Students must complete the substantive course requirements for the major and minor fields. 5. Students must maintain a grade point average of 3.0 both in political science and overall. 6. After completing all graded course requirements, students must register for POL 699 \"Research Ph.D. Thesis.\" Students must complete a minimum of 30 hours of Thesis hours. 7. Students must complete a total of 90 credit hours, com bined, from graded coursework and POL 699 hours with a minimum of 30 hours of POL 699 credits. Graduate School regulations permit students to enroll in up to 18 hours POL 699 credits per semester during the regular academic year and 9 hours per summer sess ion. See section 9 H, Residence Requirements, below. MA f or PH.D. Candidates A student enrolled as a doctoral candidate may obtain an M.A. either on the way to the doctorate or in the event the student withdraws from graduate study without completing the doctorate. The MA degree will be earned upon the following: 1. Satisfact ory demonstration of English language proficiency. 2. The completion of POL 501, 600, and 605, or their equivalents, 3. The completion of an additional 21 credit hours of graduate coursework. a. 12 of these semester hours must be in a major field of political science (i.e., AP, CP, IR, PP), of which no fewer than 9 semester hours shall be in 600 -level political science courses. b. 9 of these semester hours must be in a minor field of political science (i.e., AP, CP, IR, PP, PRM) or a self -defined \"specialized\" minor field or ESE (Ecological Sciences and Engineering). c. Students should observe the course requirements established by each of the fields of study. 4. A grade of B- or better is required for an individual course to count toward completion of the MA degree. 5. A minimum grade point average of 3.0 must be maintained in all courses used to meet the requirements of the MA degree. 12 | P a g e 6. To receive the MA degree, the student must file and have approved a revised MA Plan of Study. 7. Register for CAND 991 in the semester the student plans to graduate. The dates in which these are due depends on the semester in which the student intends to graduate. Check the Graduate Scho ol deadlines https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/about/calendar/ 8. Complete the Master's Candidate Exit Questionnaire through the MyPurdue portal under the Academic tab and POS link. 9. Indicate intent to participate in the commencement ceremony through the graduation tab in the MyPurdue portal. Evaluation of Current Graduate Students End of Semester Progress Reviews Student progress is reviewed each semester by the Director of Graduate Studies for compliance with the Department's Guide to Graduate Studies, satisfactory performance of employment duties (if funded), and progress in coursework. Each graduate student should be making satisfactory progress through the program (see Appendix I for Satisfactory Progress Standards) , satisfactorily perform assigned as sistantship duties , and be in compliance with administrative requests and department, graduate school, and university policies . Students not making satisfactory progress or are out of compliance with policies must formulate a plan in conjunction with the G raduate Director and the chair of the advisory committee to return to satisfactory progress within a specified time frame. Failure to meet these conditions may result in suspension or loss of funding and/or dismissal from the program. In extraordinary circ umstances, students may appeal for an exception to satisfactory progress standards by petition to the DGS and the Graduate Studies Committee, and with the support of the chair of their advisory committee . Routine variances will be addressed by the DGS and GSC. Non -routine requests require review and approval by the Department Head and other entities such as the CLA Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies , the Graduate School, and/or Human Resources. Annual Review by the Faculty Each graduate student's record and demonstrated capacity for continuing graduate studies will be reviewed annually by the Graduate Studies Committee and the political science faculty as a whole. The review will be completed during the spring semester of each ac ademic year. At the beginning of spring semester each graduate student will submit their Annual Activity Report to the DGS, the Academic Program Manager, and the chairperson of their advisory committee. Each graduate student will meet with the chairperson of their advisory committee in the spring semester (usually January) of each academic year to discuss their Annual Activity Report. (see Appendix J) and complete the Advisor Assessment Form (see Appendix H). Both the chairperson of the graduate student's advisory committee and student will sign the Advisor Assessment form and submit it to the Academic Program Manager and DGS . Both will be used to inform the Department's annual review process. Copies of these evaluations are available to the student upon the student's request. 13 | P a g e Both students and graduate faculty have responsibilities in the graduate student evaluation. It is the intent of the faculty that each graduate student be fully informed concerning the student performance and capacity for graduate study. The Director of Graduate Studies and the chairperson of the graduate student's advisory committee are jointly responsible for overseeing the student's progress and development and for bringing to the student's attention relevant informati on concerning the student's performance and demonstrated capacity for graduate study. In addition to awarding a letter grade for coursework, professors provide a detailed evaluation of each graduate student enrolled in their course. Copies of these evaluations are available to the student upon the student's request. Progress toward completion of the dissertation is evaluated each semester by the chairperson of the student's advisory committee. Grades A graduate student is expected to maintain at lea st a 'B' average in all graduate coursework. If the work of a student falls below an average of 3.0, the student will be notified by the Director of Graduate Studies in writing that the student should bring the GPA up to a 3.0. If the student does not bring the GPA up to a 3.0 by the conclusion of the next academic semester, the Department Head, upon recommendation by the Director of Graduate Studies, may inform the student they must leave the graduate program. Students should not assume that a grade point average slightly above a 3.0 is evidence of \"doing well.\" A student is eligible to take the Ph.D. examinations only if the student has earned at least a 3.0 average in all political science coursework and a 3.0 average in overall coursework. Th e student must also have no outstanding incompletes, and have successfully met the English Proficiency requirements. Students should not assume that coursework alone is sufficient preparation for Ph.D. examinations. Incompletes University regulations state that an incomplete (I) grade must be made up no later than one academic year after the grade was given or the incomplete grade shall revert to a failing grade. This time limit may be extended only when there is a documented explanation of extenuating circ umstances, and the request is approved by the Department Head and by the Dean of the Graduate School. The Department considers an incomplete (I) grade as evidence that the student is not making satisfactory progress in the program , thus the incomplete must be made up within one semester to maintain good standing in the program, and be considered for continued funding through a department -paid assistantship . In order to standardize time allotted to make up an incomplete around summer terms , students accruing an incomplete during spring term must make up their incomplete by December 15. Students accruing an incomplete in fall term must make up their incomplete by July 15. Respectively, these dates are considered the deadlines for making up an incomplete \"within one semester.\" Students facing extraordinary circumstances may appeal for exceptions to satisfactory progress standards through petitioning the Graduate Studies Committee with the support of their major advisor. Some courses in the P hD program are repeatable for credit. A student will not be permitted to enroll in a repeated course (course with same course number) if they have a current I, PI, or SI grade under that course number. When incompletes are given, an incomplete form (office registrar's form 60) should be completed by the faculty member teaching the course and filed in the department with the Academic Program Manager . This form should provide a documented explanation of the circumstances of the incomplete, the reasons for 14 | P a g e granting an incomplete, and what is required to complete the coursework. When the student has completed the work, the instructor will update the student's grade via the Grade Change Work Flow available under the faculty tab in MyPurdue. To remain eligible for department funding students must resolve incompletes within one semester of receiving the incomplete (see above). Examinations Students must write a Major Field Research Paper, take and pass two written examinations, one in the major field and one in the minor field, and pass an oral examination. 1. Students must submit their Major Field Research Paper on or before the 8th week in their 6th semester in the program. Specific dates announced each year by the Academic Program Manager. The written ex ams cover important debates and literature within each field. The department maintains a file of old exams for students to review. Generally, students will take their written exams during a two -week period following their fourth semester or fifth semester; students are given 72 hours to write each of these take -home exams. It is permissible to split the exams up, and take one in the fall and one in the spring, or to take them in successive years, although many students take both exams the same semester. Exam dates are announced one semester prior to the exam date. Dates typically occur in the week prior to the beginning of the semester or during the first week of the semester in the spring and fall. 2. The same semester students complete the last of their written exams, they must schedule, complete, and pass an Oral Examination, which must take place before the last week of the semester. Major Field Research Paper The Major Field Research Paper is a research paper that reflects the student's knowledge of the field and allied areas of study, capacity to undertake independent research, and ability to think and express ideas clearly. The expectation is that most students will revise a paper they have written for a research seminar, aimi ng to refine it to produce a paper of near -publishable quality. Graduate students must submit a Major Field Research Paper no later than the 6th semester and no earlier than the fourth semester. Major Field Research Papers will be accepted twice during the academic year, fall and spring semesters, approximately eight weeks into each semester. Since the paper must be submitted no later than the 8th week of the 6th semester in residence, it may be turned in before students have completed their writt en exams. Specific dates will be announced concurrent with the announcement about written exam dates. Waivers of this deadline will be considered by the Graduate Studies Committee upon student petition and the endorsement of the student's major advisor and only under extraordinary circumstances. Short -term extensions on the Written Exams or Major Field Research Paper deadlines are not permitted except in the case of documented medical or personal emergencies and endorsement of the student's major advisor. 15 | P a g e The consent of the student's major advisor is required before a Major Field Research Paper may be submitted. Students are expected to consult with their major advisor regarding any submission deadlines to ensure timely feedback on their Major Fie ld Research Paper. Students must fill out a form, available from the Academic Program Manager , seeking permission to submit their research paper, which both the student and the major advisor can sign electronically. Although papers co- authored with faculty members are possible, the Major Field Research Paper must be the principal work product of the student. The major advisor's statement regarding consent to submit the major research paper in the form submitted by the student should include language indicating that the work is the sole or principal product of the student. Papers may be processed through IThenticate and a report provided to the grading committee. The Major Field Research Papers will be read by the student's major advisor and the other faculty members in the major field; at least three faculty members must be available to read the paper. If additional faculty members are needed, they will be identified by the student's major advisor in consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies. Evaluation of the Major Field Research Paper (pass/fail) will focus on the paper's demonstration of the student's ability to conduct independent research. To receive a 'pass' evaluation, a grade of 'pass' from a majority of graders is necessary. The subm itted paper must demonstrate a thorough understanding of the existing literature, application of appropriate research methodologies, and a meaningful contribution to the field of study. An overall 'pass' is necessary to continue in the Ph.D. program, and students will have two opportunities to receive a 'pass' evaluation. The paper evaluation becomes one part of a student's overall portfolio used to judge a student's status in the program and their eligibility for funding. Written Examination s Students take written examinations after they have completed their core course requirements and as they are completing their Ph.D. coursework in their major and minor fields. The examinations must be taken no later than the semester after the coursework on the Plan of Study is completed. The Plan of Study must be up -to-date. A student is eligible to take the exams if the student has: (1) earned a 3.0 GPA in graduate political science courses and overall; (2) no outstanding incompletes; (3) a Plan of Study approved by the Graduate School; (4) successfully met the English proficiency requirement; and (5) will have completed all required coursework in the exam field(s) by the end of the semester in which the examination(s) is (are) taken. Waivers of this deadline will be considered by the Graduate Committee upon student peti tion and the endorsement of the student's major advisor and only under extraordinary circumstances. Short -term extensions on the Written Exams or Major Field Research Paper deadlines are not permitted except in the case of documented medical or personal em ergencies and endorsement of the student's major advisor. A student may not change fields, committee members, or switch major and minor areas after the examinations have been scheduled. Registering for and receiving the exam from the Academic Program Manager constitutes \"taking the exam,\" whether the student submits the answers. 16 | P a g e Students will be examined in their major field and minor field. Exams American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, and Public Policy will be 72 -hour, open - book, ta ke-home exams. Each written exam will be devised and evaluated by the tenured and tenure - track faculty in that field. Written exams will be submitted to the faculty for evaluation without student names or identification. Written exams may be processed th rough IThenticate and a report provided to the committee. The evaluation process for a minor field in Political Research Methodology consists of an academic paper that reflects the student's knowledge of a specialized methods sub -field and allied areas of study, demonstrates their capacity to utilize advanced methods appropriately, and demonstrates an ability to think and express research methodology ideas clearly and correctly. A passing methods paper should meet one of the following aims: 1) deve lops a methodological innovation 2) imports a method from another discipline to political science, or 3) implements a recent methodological innovation to advance substantive knowledge in a field, or 4) a topic approved by the majority of the core methods f aculty. The paper will be reviewed and assessed by members of the methods field committee. This paper is due no later than the Friday of the fourth week after classes begin of the semester the student elects to take the exam. The evaluation process of outside minor fields (such as ESE, psychological sciences, WGSS, and economics) is determined by the approved minor field department. The outside field minor advisor will communicate the results of the evaluation process to the Academic Program Manager. Exam Timing Written examinations in American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, and Public Policy will be offered at the beginning of the fall and spring semesters (either in the week prior to the semester or the first week of the semester), and will be administered by the Academic Program Manager and the Director of Graduate Studies. The exact dates of the exam will vary from year to year, but will generally occur no later than the second week of the semester. Students should be prepared to take exams as early as one week prior to the \"on duty\" date for the semester. Exact dates will be announced the previous semester. Minor field papers are due no later than the Friday of the fourth week after classes begin the semester the student elects to take the exam. Dates and procedures for customized minor fields must be determined at the time of approval for the plan of study. A passing exam must demonstrate a high -level comprehension of the research literature in a field, the ability to develop ideas creatively, and good writing and organization. The student will have two opportunities to pass the written exams. Students who fail to pass the second exam will be dismissed from the program. Exam grades may be appealed through the grade appeals process defined in th is Handbook and Graduate School policies. Oral Examination The final step of the exam process is the Oral Exam. Stu dents also must complete an Oral Examination in the semester that the last of the Major Field Research Paper and written examination requirements have been met. Students will be examined to determine their knowledge in their major and minor fields and be given the opportunity to expand on answers in their Major Field Research Paper and written exams if desired by the 17 | P a g e examining committee. It is the responsibility of the examining committee to determine whether the student is qualified and ready to undertake or continue research and proceed toward the Ph.D. degree. The Oral Examination is scheduled by the chairperson of the student's Advisory Committee with the approval of the Department Head. The student must submit a formal Request for Appointment of Examining Committee (GS Form 8) with the Graduate School to schedule their Oral Examination and appoint the Examining Committee. This form can be found at the student's MyPurdue webpage under their Plan of Study Generator. There are instructions for submitting this form in Appendix B. Al l Form 8 requests must be signed by the advisory committee chair and the Director of Graduate Studies and must be received by the Graduate School at least three weeks prior to the proposed examination date, to allow the Graduate School time to process the form. The form will include information on the date, time, room number, and title. The Oral Examination cannot be held during the last week of classes. The Oral Examination Committee will consist of representatives from each of the student's major and minor fields of study. Three members are required, but four members are recommended. Three satisfactory evaluations are required to pass the exam. The Department and Graduate School reserve the right to assign additional representatives. The committee should report the examination as \"satisfactory\" or \"unsatisfactory\" by completing the Report of Preliminary Examination (GS Form 10 ) immediately following the examination. Three members of the examination committee must evaluate the exam as \" satisfactory\" for the student to be recommended for Ph.D. candidacy. This form can be found under the Student's MyPurdue portal in the POS link. If the report is unsatisfactory, the examining committee may recommend that the student be permitted to request a second examination by submitting another Request for Appointment of Examining Committee (G.S. Form 8 ). Per Graduate School policy, \" The student must wait at least until the following session (including summer session) to repeat the examination. Should the preliminary examination be failed twice, the student may not be given a third examination, except upon the recommendation of the examining committee, support of the Graduate Studies Committee, and with special approval of the Dean of the Graduate School\" see Graduate Catalog in VII Administering Graduate Degree Programs section VII.F.3. The Doctoral Dissertation The purpose of the doctoral dissertation in political science is to provide the student with an opportunity to (1) investigate a problem in greater detail than has been possible at any previous point in the student's graduate career; (2) demonstrate the student's ability to perform original research; and (3) transmit the written findings and conclusions to others. Originality is defined broadly to allow the student considerable scope in the nature of the student's contribution to scholarship. Dissertation projects may be designed to criticize or reformulate problems that have concerned students of politics for decad es, to replicate or extend previous research, to formulate and test an original theoretical proposition, or to conduct an empirical investigation of significant questions. 18 | P a g e Final Examining Committee Chairperson After the student receives a 'pass' evaluation on the Major Field Research Paper, passes their written exams, and passes the Oral Examination, the student must seek out a faculty member who is willing to serve as his or her Final Examining Committee Chairperson (often referred to as the Dissertation Chair or Advisor ). The student should consult with their major advisor about picking an appropriate dissertation chair. The major advisor may go on to serve as the Final Examining Committee Chairperson, but will not necessarily do so. Compose a Final Examining Committee In consultation with the faculty member who has agreed to be the Final Examining Committee Chairperson, the student shall select a Final Examining Committee (often referred to as the disserta tion committee) . The Final Examining Committee shall consist of four members (a chair and three members) , only one of whom may be drawn from outside of the Department or University unless granted approval by the Graduate Studies Committee. The members shou ld represent various fields in political science, or fields outside political science that are germane to the students' dissertation topic. If a student wishes to have a professor not currently affiliated with Purdue sit on their committee, the member must be approved by the Department Head and the Graduate School. Permission to have outside members serve on a Final Examining Committee should be requested through the Academic Program Manager. Ordinarily, such approval will be granted by the Department Head if the committee member has academic or professional expertise in the student's areas of specialization. Typically, committee members who cannot be present at the defense of the prospectus or dissertation participate through web conferencing or conference calls. The student's Plan of Study must be revised to include the four committee members. The committee must be approved by the Department Head and publicly annou nced. Changes in the membership of the Final Examining Committee must also be approved by the chair of the Final Examining Committee and the affected faculty members, and changes must be made using a G.S. Form 8 at least three weeks before the final defense. Prospectus Defense After choosing a Final Examining Committee, the student will write a dissertation proposal in consultation with the committee members. The proposal is a research design and plan of work for the student's dissertation and should include a detailed summary of the student's research questions, theoretical framework, and methodological approach and plan of work. The prospectus should clearly define the format of dissertation the student will complete, a \"book -style\" or \"article -style\" format (see next section). The format of the proposal and the final dissertation should be arrived at in consultation with the stu dent's major advisor, who must give permission to circulate the prospectus before it is sent to the rest of the committee at least two weeks before the public defense. The prospectus defense must be scheduled with the Academic Program Manager a minimum of thre e weeks before the defense date using the Prospectus Defense form and must take place prior to the last week of classes of the academic session. The date and room of the prospectus defense is announced to the faculty and graduate students of the department, who are invited to attend this open seminar. The committee members sign the Prospectus Defense form after the prospectus has been approved. A copy of the proposal and the names of the four Final Examining Committee members will be placed in the student's file at the time of the prospectus defense. Graduate Students must defend their prospectus by the end of their seventh semester in the program (typically fall of the fourth year) to remain within the 19 | P a g e guidelines of satisfactory progress. Note that the final dissertation should be consistent with that which was approved at the proposal stage. If the format or substantive aims change, the committee should re-approve the updated plan. The student should submit a Prospectus Change Form that includes committee and DGS approval to the Academic Program Manager to maintain as part of the student's record. Substantial changes to the topic or format may require a re -defense of the prospectus. Dissertation Style Graduate stu dents may choose to write a scholarly \"article -style \" dissertation or a \"book style\" dissertation . A book -style dissertation follows the normal conventions of a book -length manuscript in content, style, and format . The article -style dissertation format requires organization and careful front -end planning by the student. A student who wishes to use an article format for the dissertation should seek the approval of their Dissertation Chair and Examining Committee befor e beginning the project . The use of the article -style dissertation format is entirely at the discretion of the student's Dissertation Advisor and Committee . Intent to use this format must be stated at the student's dissertation proposal presentation. Curre nt Purdue political science graduate students are permitted to adopt this format retroactively, with explicit permission from their Dissertation Chair and Committee. For the article -style dissertation option to be successfully defended , the Dissertation C hair and Committee must deem three scholarly articles to be of publishable quality. In other words, the three substantive papers must be deemed likely to given at least a \"revise and resubmit\" decision by the editor of a reputable peer - reviewed scholarly journal . It is the responsibility of the student and the Dissertation Chair and Committee to decide which articles to include in the dissertation package. Articles included must be such that it is possible to see unity in the content of the dissertation. A rticle -style dissertations must also contain an overarching introductory chapter and a concluding chapter. No articles are required to be submitted for peer review prior to defending the dissertation. To ensure that reputable and relevant journals are targeted when preparing (and eventually submitting) articles, students must consult with their Dissertation Chair and Committee. Ultimately, the Dissertation Chair and Examining Committee (not journal editors or reviewers) will determine whether the chapte r substantially meets the content and submission guidelines for a credible submission for publication. The Department of Political Science, through the Dissertation Chair and Examining Committee retains the decision as to what constitutes a credible disser tation meeting the program's dissertation goals. Article -Style Dissertation General Guidelines 1. Must include an overall introduction chapter that discusses the literature on the topics of student's specialization, with a substantive discussion of the them es that tie together the articles and which lays out the broader contribution of the three articles. 2. Must be comprised of previously published or publishable articles (recommended three or more). 3. Must include an overall conclusion comparing/contrasting t he previously published or publishable articles and the significance of the research completed in the articles, what additional aspects of the topic still need to be explored, and so on. 4. If the dissertation contains articles that have been published previ ously, the student should note the copyright requirements and documentation required elsewhere. 20 | P a g e 5. Students are responsible for ensuring that their dissertation is consistent with Purdue's formatting guidelines. 6. The PhD dissertation proposal (written and or al) is expected to follow the general proposal defense guidelines for a traditional book -style dissertation. However, students must state their plan to pursue an article -style dissertation, and outline the proposed articles to be written. 7. The defense of t he article -style dissertation is expected to follow the defense guidelines for a traditional dissertation. Article -Style Dissertation Specific Criteria Exceptions to select criteria (4 and 7) may be requested, in writing, by the student . The request must be approved by the Dissertation Chair and Examining Committee and submitted for review and approval to the Director of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Studies Committee. The request should provide a dequate justification and appropriate evidence to support the request . 1. All articles must be based upon original research done while a political science graduate student at Purdue University. 2. The articles should be standard length for publishable papers. There is no minimum length for the introductory and concluding chapters. Ultimately, the student's Dissertation Chair and Examining Committee will determine whether the length of each article, introduction, and conclusion is sufficient to fulfill dissertation requirements. 3. To be accepted fo r fulfillment of an article -style dissertation, scholarly articles must be deemed appropriate in theme and content by the Dissertation Chair and Examining Committee . Published articles that are not relevant to the student's over -arching research topic will not count toward the required number of scholarly articles to fulfill dissertation requirements. 4. Short research notes; technical appendices to books, monographs, or dissertations; review articles; contributions to online or printed encyclopedias; and reports submitted to public or private agencies will not usually be counted toward the minimum number of articles. However, they can be included as supporting material in the sections devoted to critical review and background information. 5. Chapters from peer -reviewed edited books may also be included at the discretion of the Dissertation Chair and Examining Committee . 6. The question of whether the extent of any article overlap is excessive will be determined by the student's the Dissertation Chair and Examining Committee . A certain amount of overlap is acceptable. For example, portions of the literature review may need to be cited in the various articles because it delin eates the entire historical background of the study's focal topic. Redundancy can be reduced by citing one's own work. However, self -plagiarism -- reusing one's own previously written work or data in a 'new' written product without letting the reader know that this material has appeared elsewhere -- is prohibited. 7. Co-authorship: Recognizing that doctoral scholars may be involved in collaborative research likely to produce co -authored scholarly articles, the materials submitted for the dissertation should meet the following guidelines. a. At least one of the submitted articles must be solo -authored. b. Only works for which the student is first or corresponding author may be included in the dissertation package. That is, the student must have been substantially involved in study design, data analysis, and article writing for any co -authored article to be included in the dissertation. In the case of articles with multiple authors, the student must preface each paper with a paragraph detailing the contribution of each listed author to the creation of the publication, even if he or she is the first author. The Major Professor must confirm that the co -authored article is consistent with the intellectual independence 21 | P a g e of a traditional dissertation. c. With respect to an y submitted co -authored articles, it is up to the Dissertation Chair and Examining Committee to determine whether the student's intellectual work is extensive enough to fulfill dissertation requirements. d. Before identifying any articles to be submitted, t he student should discuss with co -authors the expectations and time -lines for article submission toward fulfillment of the article -style dissertation. e. The student must secure the permission of all co -authors on an article to submit it as part of an article -style dissertation. f. Co-authorship with the student's Dissertation Chair and Examining Committee members is common but represents a potential conflict of interest. The Examining Committee should be formed such that at least two members have no connection with any given article submitted as part of the dissertation package. g. Co-authored articles among 2 or more graduate students are not permitted for inclusion in the dissertation package. h. When using tables or materials from co llaborators, footnotes must acknowledge the contribution of the collaborators, including any figures, tables, or data that were not created by the author alone. Dissertation Format The Graduate School has certain requirements for the thesis/dissertation format. They can be found at www.purdue.edu/gradschool/research/thesis/templates.html . University format requirements include:1) font style and 3) margins; 4) pagination; 5) title page; 6) abstract; and 7) electronic submission guidelines. The format of the candidate's thesis is reviewed by the staff in the Thesis/Dissertation Office prior to the final thesis deposit appointment. The student must also obtain approval of their dissertation format from their Committee Chair. Notifying the Graduate School and Department of Intent to Graduate Students must notify the Academic Program Manager of their intent to graduate during the first week of the semester in which they plan to finish. If a student intends to graduate at the end of a given semester but has not met all of the requirements by the deadlines specified by the Graduate School, the student cannot graduate at the end of that semester but must register for the following semester. If a student is on the candidate roster for the same degree more than two sessions in a row, a late graduation fe e will be assessed. The student must register as CAND 991, CAND 992, or CAND 993 during the semester in which the student plans to graduate. An accurate and approved POS must be on file with the Graduate School prior to the start of the semester in which the student intends to graduate. The dates in which these are due depend on the semester in which the student intends to graduate. Check the Graduate School deadlines: https:// www.purd ue.edu/gradschool/about/calendar/ CAND 991 (general candidacy) - if a student is registering for at least 1 credit of research and/or coursework in their last session, then CAND 991 is the option they will need. CAND 993 (exam only) - if a student has completed all degree requirements except completing and passing their final exam and depositing their thesis, they should choose this option. CAND 992 (degree only) - if a student has completed all degree requirements except 22 | P a g e depositing their thesis, then CAND 992 is the option they will need. The Final Examination for the Ph.D. (Defense of the Dissertation) The student must devote at least two semesters following their examinations (including the summer session) to research and writing. The Graduate School requires that two semesters must pass between the preliminary and final doctoral Oral Examinations. The final examination must be taken within eight semesters of passing the preliminary examinations. After that per iod, a single eight -semester extension may be granted if the student successfully retakes the preliminary examinations, following the same rules that governed the prelims when the student initially took them. Exceptions to this rule shall be granted only u pon petition to the Graduate Studies Committee and approval by the department in cases where satisfactory progress has been made and where extenuating circumstances have arisen to prevent completion within the specified time period. For the Final Examining Committee Chairperson to perform the Graduate School required iThenticate procedure, a polished draft should be submitted to the Final Examining Committee Chairperson at least six weeks prior to scheduling the defense of the dissertation . At this time, th e Final Examining Committee Chairperson shall diagnostically review the dissertation draft using iThenticate to certify that the dissertation is original work. A copy of the iThenticate report shall be provided to and discussed with the student and with th e other members of the Final Examining Committee upon their request. The dissertation must be prepared according to the format designated by the Thesis/ Dissertation Office. The dissertation must be approved by the Final Examining Committee Chairperson before it is submitted to the Final Examining Committee. Each member of the Final Examining Committee must receive a copy of the dissertation at least two weeks before the date of the final examination . Scheduling the Defense Students must schedule their defense in consultation with their advisor and committee members. Students should schedule the exam date with their major professor and committee at least three weeks before they plan on defending. The student must submit a formal request (GS Form 8) with the Graduate School to schedule their dissertation defense and appoint the Final Examining Committee. This form can be found on the student's MyPurdue portal under their Plan of Study Generator. Form 8 requests must be signed by the Ph.D. ad visor and must be received by the Graduate School three weeks prior to the proposed examination date to allow the Graduate School time to process the form. The form requires information regarding the date, time, room number, and title of the dissertation. The room must be reserved before the form is processed. The Final Examination must be completed before the semester deadline, one week before the last day of classes for CAND 991. The deadline for students registered as CAND 993 is earlier, so if students miss the CAND 993 deadline, their registration will change to CAND 991. The student must contact the Academic Program Manager three weeks prior to the defense so that the coordinator can process the a ppropriate paperwork with the Graduate School. The Graduate Council has recommended that final examinations be scheduled for no more than two hours. Students who wish to complete the Ph.D. degree requirements during a summer session should note the following: At least two weeks before the last day of spring semester classes, the student must ask each 23 | P a g e member of the Final Examining Committee about their availability during the summer to read the dissertation and to attend the Final Oral Examination. If any member of the advisory committee will not be available, a replacement must be appointed at least four weeks before the final defense date . Check the Graduate School deadlines for summer dissertation defense and deposit requirements as they are differe nt than in the fall and spring semesters https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/about/calendar/ . The Dissertation Defense All members of the committee must be present in person or via video conference software for the dissertation defense. Three of the members of the Final Examining Committee must accept the dissertation. If fewer than three members approve the dissertation, the student does not pass their defense. Requirements following the Dissertation Defense If Fail: The student must wait at least one semester before retaking it. If Pass : Following the examination, the student may have to make changes to the dissertation a t the request of the committee. The changes and format of the thesis must be approved by the Final Examining Committee Chairperson. Once the dissertation is approved, the student must complete the Electronic Thesis Acceptance Form (ETAF, GS Form 9), which is signed electronically by the entire Examining committee. Please allow at least two weeks for review . Theses must be deposited before the end of the last day of classes . However, appointments for depositing should be made early in the semester and students should schedule their deposit appointment well before the last day of classes. Once all the appointments are filled, no more will be made and the student will need to wait until the following semester to schedule a deposit appointment . Due to the large number of theses deposited during the last week of classes, it is strongly recommended that candidates deposit their theses early to avoid long waits and the possibility of not meeting the deposit deadline and being able to graduate. Students must deposit their dissertation/thesis with the Graduate School. For more information on depositing a dissertation, click on the following website: https://ww w.purdue.edu/gradschool/research/thesis/index.html The student may submit bound copies of the dissertation to the department and the chair(s) of the Final Examining Committee. The student is responsible for all costs incurred in producing this copy. Commencement In the semester that the student plans to graduate, a \"Graduation\" link will appear in the student's MyPurdue portal. Students must indicate whether they plan on participating in the commencement ceremony thro ugh the graduation portal. There will be deadlines to indicate their intent to participate and to order a cap and gown if they are participating in commencement ceremonies . Ph.D. candidates who wish to be hooded by their advisor must get their advisor's pe rmission and fill out the Major Professor Form: https:// www.purdue.edu/commencement/students/majorProfessorQualtrics.php. Graduate School Exit Questionnaire & Survey of Earned Doctorates Students must take the Graduate School Exit Questionnaire and the Survey of Earned Doctorates. The exit 24 | P a g e questionnaire can be found in the student's MyPurdue portal under their academics tab and Plan of Study link. The Survey of Earned Doctorates link can be found here: https://sed -ncses.org/GradDateRouter.aspx . Certificates of Completion will be sent to the Thesis/Dissertation Office automatically. Students are encouraged to save a copy of the certificate for their personal records. FINANCIAL SUPPORT Financial Support Awards Students entering the graduate program in political science and pursuing a Ph.D. degree may be offered a package of financial support for a defined period of time that includes a stipend , tuition remission, and other benefits as defined by Purdue policy (see https://www.purdue.edu/policies/human - resources/vif11.html ). The support may be in the form of a graduate assistantship, fellowship, or other award. Students holding assistantships are considered graduate staff and are subject to Purdue' s policies in the Graduate Staff Manual. https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/documents/gpo/graduate -student - employment -manual.pdf Contin ued eligibility of any department offers of funding is contingent on the student meeting requirements of the univer sity, college, an d department , maintaining satisfactory standing in the program and satisfactorily performing duties associated with employment , and/or meeting conditions of fellowships . Fellowships or grants won by the student from sources outside the university may allow the student to extend the time -window to use the offered semesters of departmental through the end of their 12th semester in the program. External funding , Funding Time -Use Limits, and Extensions Students must notify the department of external sources of funding (from outside t he Department and/or the University). Students must notify the Academic Program Manager and seek approval from their Major Advisor or Dissertation Chair, and the DGS. The purpose is to ensure that the funding does not violate Purdue policies contained in t he Graduate Employment Manual , the responsible conduct of research policies, or policies related to intellectual property or reportable outside activities. Students entering the graduate program in political science and pursuing a Ph.D. degree may be eligible to receive up to 10 academic year semesters of funding from the department during their first five years in the MA/PhD program, provided they are making satisfactory progress and meet conditions of eligibility for funding . The total number of semesters specifi ed in the original offer letter may vary depending on prior degrees and/or planned transfer of coursework that alters the timeline to completion of the degree . Normally, funding awards are expected to provide support for completing the MA/PhD within a five -year timeline (10 academic -year semester s). Students may extend the timeframe in which to use their semesters of funding defined in the original offer letter by securing funding from outside the department or through approval of a leave of absence that extends the satisfac tory progress timeline . Reque sts for extensions must be s ubmitted to the Director of Graduate Studies, with a letter of support from the advisor . Requests to extend funding beyond the 25 | P a g e 12th semester of the program will be reviewed by the Graduate Studies Committee, the Department Head and, if required , by other administrators b eyond the level of the Department. A copy of the decision will be kept in the student 's file. Students may (with approval) extend their time to use the guaranteed funding by up to two semesters by obtaining up to two -semester of noncompetitive external funding during their first 10 AY semesters . These could include TA positions in different department s or RA positions funded by a faculty grant. The extension is proportional to the number of semesters of external funding and must be used before the end of th e 12th semester (typ ically sixth year ) in the program. For example, students who TA for one year in another department may thus be eligible to receive department funding in their 11th and 12th AY semesters (typically the 6th year in the program ). Students may (with approval) extend the time to use the guaranteed funding by up to four semesters by applying for an d winning competitive external funding, such as grants, fellowships, or scholarships (including awards given by CLA or the Graduate School) during their first 10 semesters in the program. For example, a student who received an external pre -doc in year four and f ive could return to the program to use the remainder of their guaranteed semesters. Students may extend the time to use their guaranteed funding if they have an approved leave of absence that specifies a new satisfactory progress timeline, however all guar anteed funding must be used no later than the end of the 14 th semester in the program. Students who have exceeded the time line of funding specified in the original offer of funding and have not yet completed their 14th semester in the program may request ad-hoc department funding . Generally , the department will not fund students beyond their 14th semester ( typically the 7th year ). Only students making satisfactory progress towards completion of the dissertation will be co nsidered for ad-hoc funding . Selection of students for additional fu nding depends upon progress towards degree completion, satisfactory performance of TA/RA duties, teaching and research needs in the department, and annual evaluation rankings by the advisor, graduate committee, and faculty. Funding decisions are made by the D epartment Head with advice from the DGS and GS C, contingent on teaching needs and budgets. The Department will make financial support offers based on the following policies: 1. All financial awards are contingent upon budgetary resources. 2. Continuation of funding is contingent on \"satisfactory progress\" toward completion of degree require ments and evaluations of past performance of work done as a Teaching Assistant or Research Assistant. 3. Satisfactory progress is assessed each semester based on the following criteria: returning students must maintain at least a 3.0 GPA, have resolved any incompletes during the semester immediately following the receipt of the incomplete grade, have a Graduate School approved Plan of Study by the end of the student's second semester, successfully demonstrate progress toward timely completion of the degree , and satisfactory performance of GA/TA duties in prior semesters. 26 | P a g e 4. All graduate appointments are subject to Purdue University Policy V1.F.11 Terms and Condi tions of Employment of Graduate Student Staff 5. Ultimately, funding decisions are the responsibility of the De partment Head, who has final responsibility for allocating departmental resources. Students should read and be aware of policies that apply to graduate appointments in Purdue University's Graduate Staff Employment Manual as not all policies and regulations are repeated in this Handbook. Policies are subject to change without notice. https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/documents/gpo/graduate -student -employment -manual.pdf Types of Financial Support Teaching Assistantship A teaching assistant will be assigned to support one or more classes and instructors and will work closely with instructors. Common duties include grading papers, holding office hours, keeping track of roll and grades, designing exam question s, and giving lectures or leading discussions. Before being assigned to this position, international students must demonstrate proficiency in oral English through one of the avenues discussed above. Teaching assistants should plan to attend all class sessions unless specifically directed otherwise by the supervising faculty member. Teaching assistants must be available and on campus, ready to work by the \"on -duty\" date each se mester. Some Teaching Assistants may serve as \"Independent Instructors.\" An Independent Instructor is assigned to independently teach an undergraduate class. The Independent Instructor will have full administrative responsibilities for the course, including textbook selection, the composition of the syllabus, the presentation of course material, the grading of all assessments, and the assignment of grades. Independent Instructors will be assigned a faculty mentor, and the faculty mentor should be co nsulted with on all course administration issues, including textbook selection, syllabus composition, and questions arising over classroom management. More information on the faculty mentor will be included in the assignment letter. Independent Instructo rs should be on campus and ready to work by the \"on-duty\" date each semester. First -time Independent Instructors must have completed the department's Teaching Practicum, POL 686. Oral Proficiency for Non-Native Speakers of English Students must also demonstrate their ability to speak proficient English before being assigned the direct instruction of students. Non -native English speakers who receive a TA assignment and did not meet the minimum TOEFL IBT score of 27 or the minimum IELT score of 8 must work with the Acade mic Program Manager to complete all steps to obtain certification as quickly as possible. More information regarding certification can be found here: https://www.purdue.edu/oepp/oept/methods.html : Teaching assistantships that do not require certification are very limited. Students without certification will not be eligible for some types of funding. See additional information here: https://www.purdue.edu/oepp/index.html . 27 | P a g e Research Assistantship A research assistant will be assigned to a one or more faculty members and will work closely with them on their research project(s ). Tasks will differ depending upon the needs of the assigned faculty members. Research Assistants must be available and on campus, ready to work by the \"on-duty\" date each semester. Fellowships and Grants In addition to funding provided by the Department, students can seek outside funding through grant and fellowship opportunities. Graduate fellows receive scholarships or fellowship payments made to assist them in pursuing a course of study or research. This payment is not a payment for teaching, conducting research, or other services. Purdue does not report the payment to the IRS. Graduate fellows have the following characteristics: Fellows must be candidates for a degree. Fellows must have major professors who can appropriately mentor t he proposed research and provide an environment conducive to carrying out this research. Fellows generally are free to explore new areas, depending on the progress of the research. Fellows are not considered graduate staff of the University. Payment is provided in the form of a stipend provided to support the fellow. Stipends are not considered compensation for services. Fellowships generally are awarded to students who may freely select the faculty adviser with whom they wi ll conduct research while receiving their stipend. The Graduate School maintains information about fellowships and a links to search engines to help find fellowships. These can be found here: https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/fellowship/funding - resources -for-stude nts/fellowships/index.html. Please visit this site for further information regarding financial assistance. Listed below are a few examples of the grants/fellowships available. There are other fellowships that students may receive through the Graduate School for which they do not directly apply.

Promise Award PROMISE is a College of Liberal Arts Award that supports CLA graduate student research, exhibition, scholarly activity and conference travel. Applications will be funded and managed by the CLA Dean's Office. All graduate students in the College of Liberal Arts may apply once each year to this program. PROMISE funds will not be avai lable for conference presentations by first year master's level students. Policies related to PROMISE funds are subject to change from year to year, and might not be available. More information about the award can be found Award Established in 2012, this award seeks to honor the memory of graduate student Devin Roberson by rewarding one student annually for their dedication to the field of political science. Devin was a Ph.D. student in the political science department at Purdue University. Prior to joining political science, she had been a student in Purdue's Ag Econ program. She had been battling breast cancer, which spread to her lungs. As Devin was diagnosed with the disease, her mother passed away from the same illness. Throughout all of this, Devin continued pursuing a doctoral degree in political science and demonstrating her strength daily until March 2012. This award is sponsored by the Purdue University Department of Political Science and administered by the Political Science Graduate Student Association. 1. The award is open to applicants that are full -time graduate students in the Department and is gra nted to one graduate student annually. 2. Nominations are accepted from only political science faculty members. Faculty members should submit a completed nomination form for each student they wish to nominate. 3. In recommending the award, the Selection Committe e (consisting of two graduate students and one faculty member) will consider the general suitability of the candidate, including character, academic achievement, and dedication to the field of political science. 4. Funds will be applied to the selected student's departmental travel fund account. The current value of the award is an additional $250 towards conference travel. Course Enrollment Requirements for Funded Students 29 | P a g e Students who are funded by the Department or on fellowship need to regis ter for coursework toward their academic progress. A full-time course load for most students is defined as 9 credits for fall and spring semesters. In the summer, a full -time course load for most students is defined as 3 credits . Students holding graduate appointments must be registered for at least 3 credit hours of graduate level course and/or research work each session in which they receive a salary. If a student is teaching or receiving a fellowship in the summer, they must register for 3 credit hours i n one of the summer modules. Please consult with the Academic Program Manager on summer registration no later than April 1 to ensure proper registration in courses. Those students with other sources of funding, including fellowships and federal loans, may have different registration requirements as conditions of their funding. Students carefully review their individual offer letters and other relevant documents to ensure adequate registration. Terms of Employment All graduate appointments are s ubject to Purdue University Policy V1.F.11 Terms and Conditions of Employment of Graduate Student Staff . In addition, policies and procedures related to graduate staff appointments are contained in the Graduate Staff Employment Manual: https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/documents/gpo/graduate -student -employment -manual.pdf To be eligible to hold any graduate staff appointment, during any session, an individ ual must be enrolled as a graduate student in a degree or teacher license program and be registered for at least three credit hours of graduate -level course and/or research work. Graduate staff employment is incident to graduate study. Continued employment is subject to the availability of funds. The employment of graduate staff may be terminated prior to the expiration of the stated employment period or the compensation reduced during such period in the event federal or state appropriat ions are reduced or are deemed insufficient by Purdue University. Compensation paid from other sources will be paid only to the extent of funds available from such sources. If for any reason employment is terminated before the expiration of the stated employment period, compensation shall be paid up to but not beyond the date of such termination. All staff members, including graduate staff employees, are expected to become familiar with and abide by the administrative procedures of the University as well as its rules and regulations in effect, from time to time, as set forth in the University policies, actions of the president, faculty, and Board of Trustees. Employees engaged in teaching are expected to become familiar with the regulations relating to students. Continuation of graduate employment is conditional upon performance of the work assigned and/or satisfactory academic progress. The employment of any graduate staff member may be terminated, in consultation with Human Res ources, at any time prior to the expiration of the stated employment period by the University for Just Cause. Just cause includes but is not limited to inadequate performance, lack of progress toward degree, budgetary constraints or misconduct, which inclu des the repeated or serious violation of University rules, regulations, or policies. No extension or renewal of employment of any graduate student beyond the stated employment period shall be effective unless a notice in writing is given to the student. Graduate student employment is subject to the University's policy on Intellectual Property (I.A.1) . 30 | P a g e Reportable Outside Activities should be structured to avoid a Conflict of Commitment. The specific responsibilities and activities that constitute an appropr iate and primary commitment to the University will vary among units and will depend on the nature of each Employee's responsibilities, but must be based on and consistent with this policy: https://www.purdue.edu/policies/ethics/iiib1.html Graduate Student Funding Review Process The Graduate Recruitment and Admissions Subcommittee convenes each year to consider new student applications for appointment and funding. In addition, each February the Graduate Committee and faculty meet to review the progress and funding status of all students currently in the program. These deliberations are used to make recommendations for funding in the next academic year to the Department Head, who has final responsibility for allocating departmental resources. The Head awards TA and RA funding based on available budgets, with priority placed on students making satisfactory progress in the program. Students who are ranked further down the funding waiting list are offered positions if and when they become available. The Head makes additional awards based on teaching needs and student performance in the program. Criteria for consideration includes performance in job duties, responsiveness to administrative requirements, adherence to policies in the Graduate Staff Empl oyment Manual, and maintaining satisfactory progress in the program. Between annual spring rankings of continuing students for funding, students may be re - evaluated and ranked as additional information about their performance in the program becomes avail able. Graduate student academic progress and work performance is reviewed each semester by the Director of Graduate Studies (see section I.ii, above). Students who are not making satisfactory progress towards the degree, or not in compliance with policies listed in this Guide or the Purdue Graduate Staff Employment Manual, and/or have not satisfactorily performed their assistantship or course duties may become ineligible for continued funding. PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT Travel and Conferences The Department of Political Science provides support for graduate students to attend academic conferences in which they are actively participating (e.g., presenter, discussant, chair, etc.) Graduate students may be eligible for additional funding if they author or co-author a paper with a faculty member to be presented at a second professional conference or if they present a second paper of their own. If the same conference paper is to be presented an additional time at a new conference, each additional time the paper must go through a significant revision with a faculty member certifying that subsequent presentations are of revised papers. The amount of funding provided each year is based on the availability of funds in the Department budget, and will be announced by the Head each year. Travel funds must be expended by June 15 of the following year unless permission is given by the Department Head to carry funds forward for a specific conference expense. Travelers must follow Department, CLA, and Purdue University's travel policies and guidelines https://www.purdue.edu/procurement/travel/index.php . 31 | P a g e In addition, students mus t review and sign the Department's Travel Policy guidelines and adhere to the policies to be eligible for future funding. Students will work with the Department's Travel Administrator to request trips and prepare expense reports. Departmental travel funding is contingent upon adherence to University and Department travel policies and procedures. Graduate students are responsible for ensur ing that funding is secured before they initiate the travel request process by confirming with the Department Trav el Administrator . If a student's expenses exceed the funding received, the student is responsible for the overage amount. The University offers eligible students the option of a travel credit card. Applications for the travel credit card as well as policies associated with the travel card are available with the Travel Administrator . Failure to submit travel forms and receipts by required deadlines, or failure to follow other travel procedures may result in cancellation of the travel card. Graduate students may seek conference and research travel funding through the College of Liberal Arts PROMISE Program. For more information see this website: https://cla.purdue.edu/students/graduate/promise/ . Before trip Travelers must have completed the annual required Professional Conduct training offered during report week each year. Travelers must submit a travel request to the Political Science Department Travel Administrator no later than two weeks in advance for domestic travel and one month in advance for international travel. Information need ed to initiate a travel request: o Destination (city, state/region, country) o Departure and return dates/times o Reason for travel (presentation, research, etc.) o How trip will be funded? Which account should be charged? (PROMISE, department funding, external incentive, etc.) o Estimate of applicable expenses such as lodging, mileage, airfare, etc. The traveler will receive an email once the Travel Administrator has completed the travel request. It is best practice to submit your travel request to the Travel Administrator when you register for a conference. It is okay if travel details change. You will provide updated information when you submit receipts for the expense report. Send electronic confirmations or receipts to the Travel Administrator in advance of the trip such as conference registration and airfare. During trip Take pictures of your receipts and email them to the Travel Administrator . Link your travel partner app to the Concur app. Post trip 32 | P a g e Travelers must submit receipts for qualified expenses to the Travel Administrator as soon as possible, but no later than 90 days of the return from the trip as there are tax implications. Receipts submitted after 90 days from the return date may not be rei mbursed. Information needed to create the expense report: o If you use the Purdue travel card: The Travel Administrator will send you a list of receipts needed once your credit card transactions have posted. Submit all receipts or additional charges you wish to have included on the expense report at this time. o If you use your personal credit card: You are required to submit all receipts and vendor information to the Travel Administrator who will then create an expense report for you. The Travel Coordinator will provide you with an expense report to review. As the traveler, you are required to submit the expense report as final in Concur. Note that failure to comply with travel rules and regulations set forth by the department, college, and university, includ ing meeting all required deadlines may result in denial of reimbursement of expenses. Reimbursement for Driving on University Business Each graduate student seeking reimbursement for driving on university business must first be an approved driver by Risk -Management: www.purdue.edu/policies/facilities -safety/iva1.html#statement . Placement The Department of Political Science has a substantial interest in the successful job placement of graduate students in our program. The Department assists graduate students in finding their first academic or non- academic position. Placement candidates work closely with their major professor and their committee to prepare their job market materials. The Associate Director of Graduate Studies serves as the Placement Director . The ADGS and Academic Program Manager assist placement cand idates by providing guidance and consultation about the job search process , providing feedback on their material, and by managing the submission of letters of reference for academic jobs. The Department offers a Placement Practicum Couse in spring and fall semesters and all graduate students who have completed the prospectus are expected to enroll or, if working off campus, participate without enrolling. The Placement Director and Academic Program Manager organize placement -related speakers and professional development activities throughout the year and meet with candidates on the market to review materials and assist in preparing for interviews. Academic Jobs To successfully place our students with the most effective use of resources, these poli cies govern the Department's placement services for academic jobs: 1. Students are eligible for placement services once they have defended the dissertation, or the major professor certifies in writing that it will be completed in time for August commencement. Most academic positions require that the Ph.D. be completed either by the time of the interview or by the time the appointment begins. 2. The academic job market is competitive and time -consuming. You should only go on the market when you are ready. A genera l rule of thumb: If you are not ready to give a job talk, you are not ready to be on the market. 33 | P a g e 3. The Department's placement services will be available to each student for a maximum of three calendar years from the time the student first uses the services. Additional support after three years requires approval from the Graduate Director. 4. Placement candidates will be proactive in their career search in preparation for managing their careers beyond their first position. They will create a placement profile whe n they go on the market and will update their profile with the Academic Program Manager each year. The placement profile is an internal document that will be used by staff for website updates and other administrative tasks. The update should occur each fal l before orientation, or at the time a candidate becomes eligible for placement services. 5. Most or all components of the student's file will be hosted by online web hosting services. The Department is currently using Interfolio Dossier for this service. The Department will reimburse the placement candidate, providing a receipt is submitted, within the semester of use up to $100 per year for three years from the time the student first uses the service. However, placement resources are subject to change from year to year based on budgets and might not be available. Students may submit multiple receipts to the Academic Program Manager for processing the Interfolio Dossier deliveries. Process and amounts are subject to change each year. 6. The Placement Director must approve all CVs before placement candidates may use the Department's services. The placement candidate assembles other elements of the file by uploading them to Interfolio Dossier, or other modes of electronic submission. 7. Placemen t candidates will ask their recommenders to submit letters of reference directly to the Placement Director at least two weeks before their first deadline. Placement candidates will follow the letter of recommendation process provided by the Placement Direc tor and Academic Program Manager . 8. Placement candidates will inform the Placement Director and their major advisor of all applications. The list should be updated regularly so that the Placement Director and major advisor can reach out to scholars in their networks at those institutions. 9. The Placement Director and Academic Program Manager should be notified when a candidate receives an invitation for a campus interview so a practice talk can be scheduled. Candidates will give at least one practice talk before interviewing. The Placement Director can also help candidates prepare for a remote video or telephone interview. 10. Once a candidate receives an offer, the Placement Director can provide advice on negotiating a good offer. 11. The Placement Director and Academic Program Manager will collect placement data for departmental records. Placement candidates will accommodate these requests for information in a timely manner. Non-Academic Jobs To successfully place our students with the most effective use of resources, these policies govern the Department's placement services for non -academic jobs: 1. The non-academic job environment is quite different from the academic environment. Some 34 | P a g e positions have highly structured hiring processes, whereas others do not. Fo r this reason, graduate students pursuing non-academic jobs should work directly with their major advisor and the Placement Director to determine what services are appropriate. Services might include resume review, mock interviews, and advice on negotiatin g a job offer. 2. Students are eligible for placement services once they have completed a master's degree or the major advisor certifies they will have at least an M.A. by the time of employment. 3. Placement services will be available to each student for a maxi mum of three calendar years from the time the student first uses the services. Additional support after three years requires approval from the Graduate Director. 4. Placement candidates will be proactive in their career search in preparation for managing their careers beyond their first position. They will create a placement profile when they go on the market and will update their profile with the Academic Program Manager each year. The placement profile is an internal document that will be used by staff for website updates and other administrative tasks. The update should occur each fall before orientation, or at the time a candidate becomes eligible for placement services. 5. The Placement Director and Academic Program Manager will collect pla cement data for departmental records. Placement candidates will accommodate these requests for information in a timely manner. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT Orientation New and Continuing students should plan on arriving to campus at least one week before the start of classes each semester to participate in the orientation activities scheduled by the department and the Graduate School. This includes mandatory graduate teaching orientation workshops for those funded as teaching assistants during the fall semester. There will also be a departmental orientation, professionalism workshops, and supplemental training in preparation for first year classes, the dates of which will be announced to students by the Academic Program Manager . Professional Development Practicum Course The Professional Development Practicum course is designed to expose students to information about the norms and expectations of the profession of political science and address strategies for successfully navigating graduate school. Topics each semester vary. Common topics include expectations for professional conduct in the discipline, an overview of career paths, strategies for conferences and professional networking, collaborating with faculty and peers, establishing and maintaining a research pipeline and developing as a teacher. The practicum also provides workshops and information to help students make progress towards key program milestones such as preparing for qualifying exams, preparing a prospectus, finding mentors, managing stress, and maintaining work -life balance. It is also designed to encourage students to participate in the many professional development activities available through various programs internal and external to the department, such as Advanced Methods at Purdue (AMAP), writing workshops, job talks, research talks, conferences, and seminars. Thus, a portion of this class is credit for self-directed participation in professional development activities and profession - 35 | P a g e oriented communities. A minimum of two 1 credit seminars must be completed prior to scheduling the Oral Preliminary Exam. Career Development and Placement Practicum Two semesters of the Career Development and Placement Practicum are required of students who have completed their qualifying exams but we e ncourage enrollment each semester following successful completion of qualifying exams . The purpose of the practicum is to assist students in identifying career options, planning materials for their job search, and practicing key skills of presenting their work to others. This practicum will be held during the fall and spring of each year. Political Science Graduate Student Association All graduate students in the department are members of the Graduate Student Association. The Association me ets periodically to elect officers, discuss issues of concern to graduate students, and organize social events. The Association oversees graduate student social and professional development events as well as the Devin Roberson Memorial Award. The Association also selects nominees for various departmental committees as follows: Two representatives to departmental faculty meetings; Two members of the Graduate Studies Committee; and Graduate students may also be invited to participate on faculty search committees by the Department Head . Only s tudents who have passed qualifying exams and have expertise in the area of a search may be selected . Summer Programs/Workshops The Department of Political Science regularly supports student's attendance at the Summer Program in Quantitative Methods of Social Research (ICPSR) and the Summer Wo rkshop at the Institute for Qualitative and Multi -Method Research (CQRM/IQMR) or other similar types of programs as Department budgets allow. A call for application, which has included an essay explaining how participation in the desired program would contribute to research and a current CV, is sent in the fall Semester for faculty to review and select participants. The Department will cover some or all of the costs of registration for each program for selected students. Students will need to discuss with their Major Advisor and Academic Program Manager the options should course credit be desired for the summer workshops. The student is responsible for travel, lodging, meals, and incidental expenses as applicable. Department travel funds may be used as long as the dates of travel and workshop occur are in the appropriate fiscal year in which funds are used. The fiscal year begins on July 1 and travel funds are renewed on that day. Students are encouraged to seek funding through PROMISE Grants. Summer Program in Quantitative Methods of Social Research (ICPSR): www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/sumprog Since 1963, the Inter -university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) has offered the ICPSR Summer Program in Quantitative Methods of Social Research as a complement to its data services. The ICPSR Summer Program provides rigorous, hands -on training in statistical techniques, research methodologies, and data analysis. ICPSR Summer Program courses emphasize the integration of methodological strategies with the theoretical and practical concerns that arise in research on substantive 36 | P a g e issues. Summer Workshop at the Institute for Qualitative and Multi -Method Research (CQRM/IQMR): www.maxwell.syr.edu/moynihan_cqrm.aspx The institute seeks to enable participants to create and critique methodologically sophisticated qualitative research designs, including case studies, tests of necessity or sufficien cy, and narrative or interpretive work. It explores the techniques, uses, strengths, and limitations of these methods, while emphasizing their relationships with alternative approaches. Topics include research design, concept formation, methods of structur ed and focused comparisons of cases, typological theory, case selection, process tracing, comparative historical analysis, congruence testing, path dependency, interpretivism, counterfactual analysis, interview and field research (including archival) techn iques, necessary and sufficient conditions, fuzzy set methods, and philosophy of science issues relevant to qualitative research. UNIVERSITY AND DEPARTMENT POLICIES Students are expected to be active members of the Department while in Graduate School. You should regularly attend departmental meetings, job talks, guest lectures, workshops, etc. each semester, because these are important opportunities for you to become acquainted with the professional expectations of the discipline and to learn more about top ics that interest you. Success in the program is not limited to classroom performance ; it includes being actively engaged in personal and professional development activities. The Professional Development Practicum is a required part of the curriculum, as is the Career Planning and Placement Practicum. Please refer to the Graduate Plan of Study. Welcome Week Workshops. Each year we will have annual meetings, workshops, and other trainings scheduled during the week prior to classes. Students should plan to be in residence and in attendance at these events. These events occur during Report W eek, one week prior to the beginning of classes each academic year. Students are expected to arrive on time to classes, guest lectures, and meetings. You are expected to be courteous to your fellow students, professors, and guests, and to observe department and Graduate School deadlines. Students should monitor deadlines and can find information on them here: https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/about/calendar/ . Department deadlines will be published and posted at the beginning of each semester. https://cla.purdue.edu/academic/polsci/gradprog/GraduateCalendars.html . Academic Integrity and Dishonesty, and Adherence to Profession al Ethics Please review the material on academic integrity targeted to towards graduate education at the following link: https://www.purdue.edu/odos/osrr/academic -integrity/gr aduate.html Students will produce their own scholarship, avoid academic dishonesty, and adhere to Purdue's Code of Student Conduct. Purdue is a research -intensive institution, and the Department is committed to helping students produce their own research and scholarship. 37 | P a g e Students are expected to respect the rights of others and to refrain from any conduct that tends to obstruct the work of the University or to be injurious to the welfare of the University. The fo llowing actions constitute conduct for which students may be subject to administrative action or disciplinary penalties: Dishonesty in connection with any University activity. Cheating, plagiarism, or knowingly furnishing false information to the University are examples of dishonesty. As recognized by the University Senate, \"the commitment of the acts of cheating, lying, stealing, and deceit in any of their diverse forms (such as the use of ghost -written papers, the use of substitutes for taking examinations, the use of illegal cribs, plagiarism, and copying during examinations) is dishonest and must not be tolerated.\" (www.purdue.edu/odos/osrr/academic -integrity/index.ht ml). The following behaviors (among others) are considered violations of these standards and are subject to disciplinary action as set forth in these procedures: Cheating: Students are expected to adhere to the guidelines provided by instructors for academic work so that no student gains an unfair advantage. Using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, study aids, notes, or any other device in any academic exercise will not be tolerated. Unauth orized materials may include anything that gives a student assistance that has not been approved by the instructor in advance. Plagiarism : Intentionally or knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one's own in any academic exercise. This is most likely to occur in the following ways: o Using the exact language of someone else without the use of quotation marks and without giving proper credit to the author. o Presenting the sequence of ideas or arranging the material of someone else even thoug h such is expressed in one's own words, without giving appropriate acknowledgment. o Submitting a document written by someone else but representing it as one's own (http://www.purdue.edu/odos/osrr/academic -integrity/index.html ) Fabrication : Intentional and/or unauthorized falsification or invention of any data, information or citations in any academic exercise. Multiple Submissions : The submission of substantial portions of the same academic work for credit more than once without authorization from the concerned instructors. Collusion : Intentionally or knowingly helping another to violate any regulation governing the standards of academic integrity described in these regulations. Students may only collaborate on academic work within the limits prescribed by the instructor. The commitment of such breaches of academic ethics can result in expulsion from the Political Science graduate program and Purdue University. The faculty of the Department of Political Science is committed to training students to produce original scholarship. The faculty has identified iThenticate as a teaching tool that will be used to facilitate this training. For more information regarding misconduct, please refer to the University Code of Student Conduct: www.purdue.edu/odos/osrr . In general, knowledge and adherence to policy and procedures is the responsibility of all students, faculty and staff. The University Policy Office is a resource that can help you to become familiar with policies 38 | P a g e related to academic and research affairs, business and finance, ethics, facilities and safety, human resources, information technology and records. www.purdue.edu/policies/index.html . All students are expected to be aware of and uphold standards of p rofessional ethics as articulated in the American Political Science Guide to Professional Ethics in Political Science . In addition, nearly all professional organizations have a \"Code of Conduct\" or \"Professional Conduct policy. Students must adhere to these policies as participants in professional organizations and the associated confe rences. Violation of professional ethics and codes of conduct may be grounds for dismissal from the program. All students are required to complete a \"professional conduct\" training module each year that describes the norms, rules, and expectations in the d iscipline of political science. Conflict of Interest Policy for Research University employees involved in research must be concerned about conflict of interest. Recent federal regulations require that universities receiving federal funding maintain a writt en and enforced policy on conflict of interest that includes financial disclosures, institutional review of disclosures, the resolution of any problems dealing with conflict of interest, and enforcement mechanisms. A potential conflict of interest exists whenever an individual's personal ties or those of the student's immediate family could unduly influence a professional judgment. Generally, conflicts of interest can be recognized in situations where the possibility of personal gain may compromise - or appear to compromise - decisions regarding the purchasing of equipment, supplies, services, the hiring or evaluation of personnel; the selection of vendors; the operation of private business initiatives; and the etting of contracts. In research, conflicts of interest may arise when the possibility of personal gain may compromise or appear to compromise decisions involving design, conduct, and reporting of research including field testing and clinical trials. Rele vant Purdue policies on conflict of interest can be found here: www.purdue.edu/research/research - compliance/conflict -of-interest/ . Responsible Conduct of Research Required Training All students must adhere to Purdue's Responsible Conduct of Research Policy. The details of the policy and deadlines may be found here: https://www.purdue.edu/policies/academic -research -affairs/s20.html The Graduate School in cooperation with the Office of the Vice President for Research has developed the Purdue University Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) program. The purpose of this program is to inculcate, promote and sustain an environment of resear ch integrity in all graduate students, staff, and faculty at Purdue University. Please Note: While departmental RCR requirements may vary, all graduate students are required to complete the CITI RCR training module within 120 days of starting a graduate program and every five (5) years thereafter. There are two components, an online CITI RCR module that must be completed, and field specific training. Information about required field specific training options will be provided at the beginning of each academic year. Students who do not meet this requirement may become ineligible for funding and/or other forms of departmental support. 39 | P a g e Human Subjects Research Students planning to use human subjects in their research need pre-clearance from Purdue's Insti tutional Research Board. Check their website for details: www.irb.purdue.edu/ . University Amorous Relationships Policy Purdue University is committed to maintaining an environment in which learning, discovery and engagement take place in a professional atmosphere of mutual respect and trust. Amorous Relationships can develop within the University community between faculty, students and staff. Therefore, Purdue University prohibits Amorous Relationships between a student and any University employee who has educational responsibility over the student, as well as supervisors and subordinates where there is a supervisory or evaluative relationship between the parties. The ful l policy is available here: www.purdue.edu/policies/ethics/iiia1.html . Whenever anyone is engaged in a romantic or sexual relationship with someone they have authority over in the Department, that relationship must be reported to the Department Head so that alternative supervisory arrangements can be worked out. This includes relationships of TAs with students in their classes. Respect Boundaries: Sexual Violence Awareness The Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, a federal law, requires all new incoming students to receive primary prevention and awareness education about sexual violence. This law went into effect in March of 2014, which means all new undergraduate students, graduate students, and transfer students enrolling after that date must complete the Respect Boundaries: Sexual Violence Awareness program. All curren t students, including new students who are required to complete this program, can find more information about it here: https:// www.purdue.edu/ethics/ed -training/respectboundaries.php . Grievan ce Procedures If a feels that s/he has been unfairly evaluated in coursework, in the annual review, or in the M.A. or Ph.D. examination process, or feels that s/he has been unfairly treated in any other way, s/he may request that the matter be investigated by any or all of the following: the student Committee Chairperson, the Director of Graduate Studies, the Graduate Studies Committee, the Chair of the Diversity and Inclusions Subcommittee of the Graduate Studies Committee, or the Department Head. Students are advised to look at the Graduate School Ombuds program : https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/student/oga/ombuds.html . Office of Graduate Assistant and Conflict Resolution: Another important university resource for conflict management is the Office of Graduate Assistance (OGA). Find more information about it here: https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/student/oga/index.html Appeals Concerning Academic Standards: Graduate students who wish to appeal decisions concerning matters of academic standards including course grades and graduate Examination grades should review the University Catalog, Section IX: \"Graduate Student Responsibilities and Rights\" Part A based up on the type of appeal they are seeking here: https://catalog.purdue.edu/content.php?catoid=16&navoid=19705 40 | P a g e Residence Requirements According to the Graduate School policies (Policies and Procedures for Administering Graduate Student Programs, VI. B.), students must complete certain residence/credit requirements to receive the MS and Ph.D. degrees. They are: Master's Degree At least one -half of the total credit hours used to satisfy degree requirements must be earned while registered at Purdue University . More than 50 percent of the Purdue credits must be earned through the campus where the degree is conferred. At least 30 total credit hours are required. With the exception of doctoral students who are re -classified as master's students and leave the Graduate School with the master's degree, 69900 credits may not be used towards the fulfillment of master's degree requirements. Doctor of Philosophy Degree At least one -third of the total credit hours used to satisfy degree requirements must be earned while registered for doctoral study at Purdue University. At least 90 total credit hours are required. A master's degree or professional doctoral degree from any accredited institution may be considered to contribute up to 30 credit hours toward satisfying this requirement at the discretion of the student's graduate program. These credit hours are not subject to the \"Five -Year Rule\" that prohibits the use of out -of-date coursework on plans of study. See Section VII -B-1-a. o Note: The Departme nt requires that the student petition the Graduate Committee for credits to be accepted by the end of spring semester in their first year of the PhD Program. Under no circumstances may 69800 credits, other than as part of the 30 credits which may be used from a master's degree, contribute toward the 90 credits required for a Doctor of Philosophy degree Registration is defined as formal enrollment in courses offered by Purdue University. Such courses may include courses offered via distance learning technologies; however, be aware that there may be specific rules limiting the number of distance courses taken by students, particularly international students. Students should cons ult with the Graduate School and/or International Scholar Services if they plan to register in courses classified as distance learning courses. Courses include all Purdue University graduate courses approved by the student's graduate committee, including formal coursework and research credits.

Policy on Graduate Student Leaves of Absence Policies related to employment leave are covered in the Graduate Staff Employment Manual . Department 41 | P a g e policy regarding employment leave will follow the Graduate School policies. Students admitted to the MA and PhD program are expected to enroll continuously during fall and spring semesters until completion of the program. If circumstances make it necessary for a student to request a temporary leave of absence from a Political Science Graduate Program, a request in writing must be presented to the Graduate Director, who will bring the request to the Graduate Studies Committee. Time off from the program with an approved leave under this policy will not count ag ainst the time limits and satisfactory progress guidelines stated in the department's Graduate Handbook document. The time extension on deadlines will correspond to the length of the approved leave. For students who have remaining semesters on a guarantee of funding offer letter, an approved leave will not count against the total number semesters of guaranteed funding. The maximum duration of approved leave is 12 calendar months. Absences from the program that exceed this time period will require reapplication and readmission through the G raduate School, per Purdue University policy and department funding upon readmission cannot be guaranteed. Graduate st udents holding a paid staff appointment at Purdue (TA or RA position) should al so re fer to information on leaves in the Graduate Staff Employment Manual . Use of FMLA and Paid Parental leaves must be initiated t hrough Purdue Human Resources. Contact the CLA Human Resources L iaison for assistance . FORMS Graduate School Form 8: Request for Appointment of Examining Committee This form may be initiated and submitted by either the Academic Program Manager through the Graduate School Database or the student through MyPurdue. It is the department's preference that this form be submitted by the Academic Program Manager . Form 8s are required for all thesis -option master' s and doctoral candidates to schedule exams, and must be submitted and receive all department signatures at least two weeks in advance of the exam. Approval of the Form 8 will generate the requested exam form (7, 10, or 11) for the examining committee to use in recording the results of the examination. All major exams (oral exams, prospectus defenses, and dissertation defenses) must be held before the last week of classes of the academic session in which the exam is conducted. Graduate School Form 9: Electronic Thesis Acceptance Form This form can be found at the student's MyPurdue webpage under their Plan of Study Generator and must be initiated by the student. This form should be initiated following the dissertation defense and after any required revisions have been completed. After students submit the form, it will be transferred to the Final Examining Committee. The members of the examining committee may wish to review the deposit copy prior to signing the Thesis Acceptance (G.S. Form 9). Once a committee member has signed the Thesis Acceptance (G.S. Form 9), the document is approved by that individual. Each member of the Final examining committee must approve of the submission of the Thesis. The graduate school will approve of the submission only after the required exit surveys have been completed. Once the graduate school approves, the student will receive an email to let them know they are approved to deposit their thesis. 42 | P a g e Graduate School Form 10: Report of the Preliminary Examination The Preliminary Examining Committee Chair should electronically present the examination committee with the appropriate examination report form. For the oral defense, the Report of the Preliminary Examination (GS Form 10) is sent to the department by the Graduate School upon approval of the request for an examining committee (GS Form 8). This report should be completed and signed without delay for prompt submission to the Graduate School. In the case of a preliminary examination, the oral exam must be held before the last week of classes of the academic session in which the exam is conducted. Each member of the examining committee must indicate approval or disapproval and sign the report form. Only members of the approved examining com mittee may take part in the evaluation. At least two full sessions of active registration are required between the preliminary and final exam before submitting this form.

Doctoral students who have completed all required coursework and passed the preliminary examination should complete a Research in Absentia (G.S. Form 12) rather than a G.S. Form 19. Off-Campus students who are employed through the University may also need to complete a Change of Duty Station or R/I/E leave request. Department Course Agreement Form/ Registration for Research Credits The Academic Program Manager will enroll students for research credits upon receipt of a signed Course Agreement Form. Per Graduate School policy, students and faculty must have set clear expectations about the deliverables for all independent studies or research courses. The agreement must have at least one clear deliverable that the student will meet by a set deadline. Deliverables might include data sets, drafts of chapters, a research design, IRB application, grant proposals, lit review, manuscript, analyses, o r other specific research products. Due dates may be general, such as \"by end of September\" or \"by mid-semester\" or specific such as \"by March 4.\" Credit hours should correspond to the work required for the deliverables, with 1 credit being equal to appro ximately 2.5 hours of work per week over a 15-week semester. The workload per credit is based on a rough equivalency of time spent in courses as defined by 43 | P a g e https:// www.purdue.edu/registrar/documents/forms/Credit_Hr_Guidelines.pdf. This means that a 6 -hour research credit equates to approximately 15 hour of work per week. If plans fall outside of these guidelines, please describe on the form and seek approval from the Graduate Director. In addition to the Course Agreement Form, faculty must log in to their MyPurdue faculty page to mark that an agreement has been made with the student. This must be completed prior to the end of the second week of classes.
