I had put off reading it because I kept hearing that it was a joke, that it wasn't factual, etc. but then one day while I was out garage-saleing I saw it and thought, \"What the heck...its' like 50 cents\". So I got and I read it. Actually I devoured it. and I was left in tears. Thankful tears that I had found it and could begin formulating a plan. Sad tears for everything that Jenny had to go through with her son, Evan. and more sad tears for myself and my son because it took me so long to finally read it, I only wish I wouldn't have listened to others (yet again) and found out for myself and began reading it much sooner. I took A LOT of notes and wrote them all down here: Louder than Words by Jenny McCarthy I honestly don't know where to begin summarizing all the information I have read and studied. There are many points of view out there, and what you're about to read is mine. Some children are born with weaker immune systems. My son, Evan, couldn't sufficiently process the vaccines the way children who have normal functioning immunity can. So instead of strengthening his immune system, the vaccines were in fact forcing his body to attack itself, which was in turn destroying his immune system. The weakened immune system caused him to be more prone to common illnesses. Antibiotics stripped his gut, which then caused severe candida buildup, which then caused leaky gut syndrome. There was a study done by Dr. Samy Suissa at McGill University showing that the rate of autism increased to a high of 27.3 cases for every 100,000 kids two years after vaccination, whereas of the unvaccinated kids, only 1.45 cases of autism were found. When mercury was removed from childhood vaccines, rates of autism dropped by as much as 35%. Sadly, your pediatrician is not going to give you this information. Why would vaccine companies believe that vaccines could be safe for all children? It's crazy to me. Let's just say a child is born with an allergy to honey, and after a mom gives birth, the doctors rub honey all over this child's body for the next 18 months. Some bad shit is gonna happen. Then you tell the doctor, \"I think my child is allergic to honey, because his reactions all point to honey.\" The doctors ignore you, and you think, \"Hey, maybe there should be a test to see if some kids are allergic to honey, so other mom's don't have to go through this anymore.\" The government can keep giving their vaccines, just give us the test to make sure our babies can handle them. Next time you are in a room with a little over a hundred people, take a good look around. One of the people in that room is going to have an autistic child, and it could be you. In the 1970's, it used to be 1 in 10,000 children were autistic. Now it's 1 in 150. What will it take for people to wake the hell up? Now I know why I became a writes in the first place. It was never to be the funny girl who wrote books on pregnancy and child-rearing. No. God had me write those books simply as a warm-up. To get moms' attention. This is the book I hope will shift the world. This is the book I was born to write. I remember saying to Him around this time, \"God, I know you gave me an autistic so for a reason. I know I'm supposed to do something with this, and I don't quite know what it is yet, but I need you to help me out. I need to be always pointed in the right direction. I need the messages to be loud and clear so that I can serve my purpose in your calling\". I wondered how other mothers with autistic kids dealt with it. Were they also lost in knowing how to get help? I couldn't believe the red tape and the maze with no directions. All I knew was that if there was hope in anything, I was going to give it a try. Evan was born with a weaker immune system; getting vaccinated wreaked havoc in his body, and mercury caused damage to the gut (the gut being the home base for your immune system), which caused his inability to process certain proteins, and one could see the result of this damage when he consumed wheat or dairy. I recommend the Gluten Free/Casein Free Diet to many mothers with autistic children. Sometimes our kids tantrum all day long, so the only quick relief is to throw on that iPod while you're making dinner in the kitchen and listen to the sounds of Enya to take you away. I found the best DAN! Doctor in the world down in Texas. His name was Dr. Jerry Kartzinel, and on the first visit, he had Evan tested for everything and saw numerous deficiencies. But the one that was causing Evan's consistent ailments was his weak immune system. Dr. Kartzinel told me it was imperative to send Evan to the best immune doctor in the world, down in San Diego for further testing. I couldn't understand how Evan's immune system was so damaged. Dr. Kartzinel simply replied, \"Vaccines\". It was driving me mad, though, to learn that so many ailments, especially of the gut, were linked to autism. I'd always thought autism was just a brain disease. Some neurologists still think so, but if they would visit all the autistic children, as I now know, they would see bloated \"Buddha\" bellies, severe constipation, and other gut issues. It might now seem like a big deal to anyone reading this who does not have an autistic child, but these kids don't understand the concept of waiting. Food in a restaurant needs to come immediately. Waiting does not make sense, and they will tantrum like a crazy person until they get what they're waiting for. I remember people staring at me while Evan tantrumed in the grocery store line. People would stare at me like \"Wow, she totally has no control over her kid. She needs to get a grip over her child and teach him to be patient.\" Some people have actually said those words to me, and in response, I've shouted in their face, \"He's autistic, you asshole.\" I started to feel a shift in me. I was accepting what was and not hating the world for what should have been. I came to my own conclusion- that acceptance does not mean giving up. Nothing was going to stop me from pulling Evan out of this window. I just simply loved him and was proud of who he was no matter what. I found myself loving his flapping, his tip toe walking, his love of fans, door hinges, and escalators. I thought, \"So what. If he grows out of it someday, great; if not, he comes here after the prom with his girlfriend and they ride escalators til the sun comes up. Evan is perfect.\" Dr. Kartzinel told me that Evan's stool had a lot of yeast in it and that I should have started him on antifungal medication a long time ago. He felt that many of Evan's OCD behaviors were side effects of severe candida overgrowth, which wasn't uncommon in an autistic child. He explained that when a person takes antibiotics regularly, overgrowth occurs, causing OCD-like and erratic behavior. He started Evan on Diflucan, an antifungal medication. When I met Dr. San Diego, he told me that IVIG treatments could help restore Evan's immune system. Basically, that consisted of taking other people's blood cells and putting them into Evan's body through an IV every month, for 6 months. Before that could happen, we had to test Evan's immune system to see if he was even healthy enough to handle the treatment. The tricky part of this therapy is that your immune system has to be somewhat active, in case your body needs to fight off an illness from the donated blood. The results came back and I couldn't believe what the Dr. was telling me. He said that Evan was not eligible for this treatment because his immune system was that of a dying AIDS patient. After the Diflucan, I had to limit his diet even more. I was already denying him wheat and dairy, but now I had to make sure he avoided all sugars, including fruit, and anything else that yeast loved to grow on. I couldn't believe the things that took place shortly after his first week's dosage. He went full-blown Exorcist on me. His eyes were bulging with rage, and he was grinding his teeth so much when he slept that I thought he would have none left in the morning. He also threw up, and his pee was cloudy and painful to the point where he would scream when he peed. Each poopy diaper was loaded with yeast. I couldn't believe what I was witnessing. I had sympathy for Evan's pain, but after starting my heavy research online, I knew that this extreme reaction meant I was absolutely on the right track. After another couple of weeks had gone by, Evan's therapist couldn't believe the sudden burst of development. Evan was flying through his programs so well that they couldn't keep up with him. He was social with people and enjoyed having them in his world. Words cannot describe the feeling of your baby wanting to be held after years of rejection. Everyday was a miraculous introduction to this wonderful kid who was waking up from a long sleep. I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. Now in no way was Evan perfect in the eyes of parents who had typical children. He would still repeat words a few times and flap his arms, but he was no longer stuck in the world of autism. The healthier he became, the more the therapists were able to teach him. I continue to keep Evan on a wheat-free, dairy-free, yeast-free diet and always will. I also keep him on ThreeLac, a probiotic that keeps yeast in balance in the gut, and I'll always keep up with vitamins and minerals. I will continue speech therapy because he could still use some help with conversation- especially abstract language, as he gets older- but for the most part you would never be able to pick him out of a crowd as being a little unique. I did not wind up doing IVIG blood therapy because I was so happy with Evan's progress that I didn't feel the need. I did do some alternative metal detox that was all homeopathic, and I tried some other scent therapy called mapping. Also, I decided to take Evan to see an eye doctor. It turned out that Evan needed glasses. He couldn't see because his depth perception was completely off. This happens in MANY autistic kids. Look at To all the moms of typical children who tell your kids to shut up for 5 minutes, think twice. You have no idea how much you'd miss the endless talking and questions if they were ever taken away. I beg moms and dads to at least try these things. I will continue to work my butt off raising awareness for autism and banging down doors to get answers. In the meantime, don't give up hope, and remember that acceptance your child's condition does not mean giving up, it's simply loving your child for being the perfect little spirit he or she is. Look into Teach2Talk, they are DVD's. She said the book, \"Special Diets for Special Kids Two\" by Lisa Lewis. That helped out a lot. She realized that her son deserved perfect health. The website is gfcdiet.com There is a 10 week plan for GFCF at Supplementation she gets from Kirkmanlabs.com She gets multivitamin, Super-Nu Thera. Another common supplement is mercury free omega-3 fish oil. She also gave Evan vitamin B12 shots. A lot of parents notice an increase in speech after the B12 shots. To remove his candida, we started him on Diflucan, but after a few weeks switched him to a natural supplement that did the same thing called ThreeLac. That really made the yeast come out and he started talking more. Other book to check out: What your Doctor May Not Tell You About Children's Vaccinations by Stephanie Cave and Deborah Mitchell. There is a new therapy called RDI, check out their website at rdiconnect.com The mapping she talked about is found at unlimitedbrain.com Defeat Autism Now (DAN!) doctors can look for yeast overgrowth, food and environmental allergens, mineral depletion and absorption issues, parasite or bacteria imbalance, metal toxicity, and other issues.
