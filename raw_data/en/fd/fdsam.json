Vaccines are not available Deficient health care systems Poverty Vaccine hesitancy (reticencia a la vacunacion)VACCINE HESITANCE: WHO DEFINITION \"Vaccine hesitancy refers to delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services. \" Vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specific, varying across time, place and vaccines.

REASONS BEHIND PARENTAL REFUSAL TO VACCINATION (US) (1) Safety concerns Dangerous chemicals in the vaccine ( Thymerosal , alum, peanut oil) Antigenic overload (too many vaccines at the same time) Autism (the Wakefield legacy) Desire for more information from healthcare providers . Misinformation (anti vaccine groups) Not sufficient research supports vaccine claims of safety and efficacy Distrust of health authorities (CDC and FDA) Perception that Big Pharma peddles vaccines for profit C McKee, K. Bohannon. Exploring the reasons behind parenteral refusal to vaccines. J Pediatr Pharmacol Ther 2016 21(2):104- 109REASONS BEHIND PARENTAL REFUSAL TO VACCINATION (US) (2) Religious reasons Animal derived products in the vaccine Human fetal cells used to manufacture the vaccine Personal beliefs or philosophical reasons Immunity after natural infection is better than vaccine induced immunity Vaccine preventable disease are not common Healthy diet and lifestyle will decrease the chance of acquiring the disease. Vaccine preventable diseases are not dangerous and they can be easily treated. Refusal to compulsory vaccination. C McKee, K. Bohannon. Exploring the reasons behind parenteral refusal to Pharmacol Ther 2016 21(2):104- 109Peter HotezPETER HOTEZ TALKING POINTS General Childhood vaccines save lives. Childhood vaccines do not cause autism, plain and simple. The causes of autism are something other than vaccines. There is an abundance of deliberately misleading information on the Internet. Specific Myth: Mandatory vaccination is part of a conspiracy. Myth: The diseases are gone and we ono longer need vaccines. Myth: More children in the United States die from vaccines than from the diseases they prevent. Myth: Our body's own \"natural\" immunity is adequate. Concern about vaccine ingredients.WHO IS TO BLAME FOR VACCINE HESITANCY? Don't blame the concerned parents. Blame the anti- vaccine organizations that disseminate misleading and malicious information, and the local authorities that fail to enforce measures to protect pubic health.TWO CONTROVERSIAL AND PERHAPS MISSLEADING FINAL COMMENTS Vaccines are 100% safe and 100% effective. For public health practitioners vaccines are to protect communities; for parents vaccines are to protect their own children.HOW TO RESPOND TO VACCINE HESITANCY Know the local situation Identify key opinion leaders in the community Develop context appropriated educational material Peer education Link with other programs (maternal and child health)THANK YOUDETERMINANT MATRIX OF VACCINE HESITANCY (1) Contextual influences (arising due to historic, sociocultural, environmental health system/institutional, economic and political factors.)
