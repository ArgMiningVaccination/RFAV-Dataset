The House subcommittee on Labor and Health, Education, and Welfare approved a bill scheduled for House vote on April 15 which also authorizes $10 million for a regional veterinary school in\u00b7 Washington state and $5 million for modernization of the veterinary school at the University of Pennsylvania. The bill is due for Senate action later this month. After the two houses reconcile any differences on the legislation, the appropriations bill will likely become law in early April. Additional funds for the Tufts committee which will act on the veterinary proposal came from bill this month, expressed sup- the New England governors who port for the Tufts proposal Tuesday authorized up to $100,000 Wednesday in an exclusive for the planning of the regional statement to the Observer. \"I am school.

President Mayer said this week that the House appropriation ''portends success for this unprecedented attempt at regional collaboration .\" He also said, however, he is hopeful that the Senate will vote to appropriate more than the $10 million ap\u00ad proved by the House sub\u00ad committee . \"As ranking minority member of the Senate Labor-HEW ap\u00ad propriations subcommittee,\" he continued, \"I will work for Senate approval uf these needed funds.\" Judge delays trial again By ALAN STEARNS Legal warfare continued this week in the three-year-0ld Joost\u00ad White sex discrimination trial against Tufts. An Amherst economist claimed-Tuesday. that earlier testimony which found sex discrimination to be, \"essentially undeniable ,\" at Tufts was, \"invalid.\" The case was delayed in\u00ad definjJ,ely Wednesday by US District court Judge Frank Murray who added that he will hear only one more day of testimony .All that remains,if no new unscheduled witnesses are called,before defense attorney Robert Glass rests his case is the conclusion of the cross examination of Dean Harleston and the \"re.buttle\" testimony of Stephan Michaelson . Attorneys for the plaintiffs Joost White and EEOC rested their cases in January. The Chronicle of Higher Education reported last month that the outcome of this case, alone with two others, \"could help set a pattern for the court's involvement in revising the in\u00ad ternal employment decisions at colleges and universities. \" The complainants allege that Tufts discriminates against women in tenure and salary policies. Former Fine Arts Professors Christianne Joost Gaugier and Barbara White separately filed their initial complaints with the. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in November of 1972 after they were told theat they would not be rehired in the following year. , Lawyers for the two women professors also contend that the department chairman at the time of the decision not to rehire Joost and at the time of the denial of tenure to White was biased against women. (see related story page 18) Tufts' witness,Professor Ralph Beals (procounced BalesJ in using the same available data as Dr. Michelson, found that, ''There is no statistically significant difference between salaries for men and women at Tufts.\" He concluded, after look_ing at Michelson's study and his own, that, \"Neither of us should feel that sex is a deter\u00ad minant of salary.\" The variables which Beals included in his study that Michelson did not were depart\u00ad ment, department chairmanship , and lateral entry, which is an indicator of prior experience . Beals -criticized Michelson 's report for not considering department as a variable and for not using department chairmanship as a variable. He called Michelson 's ommission of chair, \"unjustified, \" and said that, \"The effect of excluding chair is to make the effects of sex on salary substantially greater.\"' He said he used department as a variable because he found, \"no cases in the literature where department was ignored.\" Beals didn't use data on the Ph:;,sical Education Department. visiting professors , Professors Emeritus, and lecturers. \"The AAUP does not report fig_ures; for lecturers,\" he explained. Beals used log salary instead of raw salary in order to obtain per cent differences rather than absolute dollar differences among gro'!ps. PhD was found to have a \"low coefficient not significantly different from zero,\" said Beals, but he used it as a variable anyway. EEOC lawyers objected to the last four pages of Beals's 17-page ' report on the grounds that it included as women faculty members individuals who are also members of the ad\u00ad ministration. Beals testified that he did not have available all the factors that affect salary such as teaching quality when conducting his study. In Monday's House sub\u00ad com mitt e e meeting, Massachusetts' representatives Silvio Conte and Joseph Early lobbied strongly for an additional $4 million appropriation from the subcommittee chairman , Rep. Daniel J. Flood {D-Pa.). Beals commented after the day's hearings that when statistical analysts come to different conclusions using the same data, it is because they made different assumptions . When they make the same assumptions , they come to the same conclusions , he added. Following Beals' testimony , Tufts Dean\u00b7 of Faculty Bernard Harleston was brought to the stand. An apparent conflict in Dean Harleston 's testimony Wednesday surfaced\u00b7 when he \"The $10 million is only a minimwn ,\" Mayer said. \"The Senate is still going to hold out for $14 mi)lion. There is still a fighting chance that we may get between $12 and $14 million.\" Flood held the line at $10 million, according to one o( his aides, because of \"general agreement on the committee that the $10 million amount -was sufficient and represented a real commitment to the school.\" Flood was quoted in the Boston Herald American as telling Conte,\"Your horses and _your pi_gs \u00b7 said that \u00b7he did ask Fine Arts Professor Ivan Galantic to resign as Chairman of his department.

Two college students in Rochester , N. Y. were touring nearby Webster, N.Y. in their 1952 pick-up truck when they were flagged down by a local policeman , whom they identified as Officer George Mackenzie . \u00b7 According to the stud~nts, the constable submitted them to lengthy interrogation and searched their truck for narcotics , but refused to explain why he stopped them. Then he asked one of the students to sit in the back of the police car while he checked his license. When the student tried to get out after a while, he found no handle on the inside of the door. Next, the policeman told the two that they were not under arrest, yet -they were towed away with their truck to the Webster police station where they. were fingerprinted, photographed , hand\u00ad cuff~d t~ a pipe on the wall, and ~earched . A few hours later, the local judge arrived and warned the students of the possible sentences that could be imposed upon them, including a $1000 fine. However , in light of the circumstances , ~e continued , the students were free to go: except for the $25 towing fee for the truck. The judge accepted the $12.50 which the two scrounged up. Asked repeatedly by the students why he detained them, Officer MacKenzie finally replied : \"because you look funny.\" M. FOR MASHER.

The administration's request of $2.8 billion dollars in student assistance funds did not include any funds for NDSL. The amount restored_ by the House subcommittee is still $32 million less than last year's NDSL ap\u00ad propriation of $332 million. If in its hearings next week the 0 Senate subcommittee does not -, match the previous House sub\u00ad committee recommendation , the two hoses of Congress will have to form a joint committee to reach a compromise. In any event, the President can still veto any proposal. Financial Aid Director Gr~nt C.urtis said he hopes Congress will eventually add the remaining $32 million and also vote an in\u00ad crease in the NDSL program. If the appropriation recommended by the House subcommittee this week is adopted, Tufts could receive as much as ten percent less than it received for fiscal year 1976. The loans at issue would apply to the 1977-78 school year's. This year's allocations will not be affected. GRANT CURTIS ... 300 million restored This year, Tufts received $550,000 in NDSt, money to be distributed to !itudents in need, to which Tufts added an ad\u00ad ditional 12 percent from its own funds. After the addition of money from repaid loans of previous years, the university loaned out $900,000 this year. Currently, 670 Tufts \u00b7 un\u00ad dergraduates receive an average of $900 apiece in NDSL loans while -200 graduate and professional students receive an average of $l500 in loans. The report, which was prepared by co\u00b7ordinator of Student Activities Steve Gesing, Director of Facilities Planning Larry Ketchen, Dean of Students Tim Winant and Dean of Faculty Bernard Harleston, was sub\u00ad mitted to the President Feb. 15. The report has been subjected to criticism lately by both students and administrators for is alledged lack of depth. Tufts debaters garner first In related developments an informal poll conducted by the Observer this week revealed that students have a wide range of priorities for what they would like to see in a temporary center. Gesing, apparently u.naware of Mayer's decision, submitted a more detailed _proposal for the renovation to Winant, including his personal recommendations for the renovation of Eaton Lounge. The proposal was part of a series of reports in response to tournainent title in four years Tufts debaters Neal Shapiro and Scott Thurm captured first place in the Suffolk Univesity Novice Debate tournament last week giving Tuft~ its first tour\u00ad nam.ent win in over four years. The two ,man squad, which compiled a perfect 4--0 record, was ranked first from a field of 35 other two person teams representing 18 colleges. In addition to their number one team ranking, Thurm was rated as the sixth best speaker and Shapiro the seventh out of total of 72 debaters. \"We have put in a lot of work this year and I felt it was just a. matter of time before we won,\" debate coach Rich Lewis remarked . In two weeks, the pair will represent Tuts at the District VIII debate tournament whkh determines participation in the National Debate Tournament to \u00b7 be held in April. \"This was really a team vic\u00ad tory, everybody helped with_the research and the preperation ,\" Shapiro, captain of the team, commented . Thurm, recently elected secretary of the team, said the victory would strengthen Tufts prestige on the debate circuit. \"I think a lot of people now realize that Tufts is a team to be reckoned with,\" Thurm added. While Lewis said he was happy with the victory, he added that a new debate office was a prerequisite to a!1y future debating success. \"A lot of teams have more money and personnel than we do, \"Lewis said, \"but all of them have a decently sized office. We can't keep working in the broom closet that we have now.\" In the coming weeks, Lewis said, the team will compete in several other tournaments, in\u00ad cluding the National Novice Debate Tournament to be held at Northwestern . The team will also sponsor its own prize debate sometime in April, according to the President of the club, Monessa Lujan. \"It won't be as structureti ,as college debate,\" Lujan said, \"but it will give members of the Tufts community a chance to view the activity.\" Nationwide, 335,000 students Feceive NDSL loans. National Direct Student Loans are allocated to the individual universities who they distribute the money to students .. The loans carry a three percent interest rate on repayment. If NDSL fails to supply the needs of students, many are required to request bank loans which carry seven percent interest rates and are often difficult to obtain, ac\u00ad cording to Curtis. The govern\u00ad ment also offers Basic Educational Opportunity Grants rnEOG) interest free but these are also more difficult to obtain according to Curtis because \u00b7 eligibility restrictions are more severe than for NDSLs. Every president since Lyndon Johnson in 1965 has tried to eliminate the program (previously known as national Defense Loans) from the HEW budget. Gerald Ford's original budget did not include NDSL money but since Carter's plat\u00ad form called for continued funding in this area. it was thought that he )Vould at least request the $332 million appropriated last year. When Carter's supplemental appropriation request for 1977 did not include NDSL money, some people feared the Democratic Congress would be less likely to . break-up the current Washington honeymoon by restoring the NDSL funds than it was during recent Republican ad\u00ad ministrations . \"Carter's platform promised these programs would be sup\u00ad ported,\" Curtis and President Mayer both said this week, before the House subcommittee made its recommendation . \"The elimination of such loans would be a catastrophe for middle class students who have come to depend on this money,\" Mayer continued. Several reasons have been offered for the various ad\u00ad ministrations ' unhappiness with the NDSL programs . Assistant to the President William Wells said he thought it is a reaction to the number of students defaulting to avoid repayment. In addition he said there is the belief that students should not have to mortgage their future.

These events, which include lectures, films, workshops , exhibits and symposia , are designed to reach both black and white students and to have them explore their interests together, he said. Last semester, the Center co\u00ad sponsored the Chuck Davis Dance Concert with the physical education department , presented _Friday, March 4, 1977 an exhibit on black history in Wessell Librarv. and showed films through the Experimental College. White also cited the upcoming lecture on \"American Foreign Policy in Latin America and the, Caribbean\" which is to be co\u00ad sponsored by the Center and the Latin American Society as an example of a cooperative venture designed to increase campus participation in Afro events. \"I think. as minorities on the Tufts campus,\" he explained, g \"we should _work together.

But as an institution solely for black the number of black students at students because that was what Tufts increased from a small Observer handful in 1966 to more than 200 in the early 70's, a need for black cultural and historical studies developed . To meet this need and to resolve ~ome of the problems the black students encountered with a predominantly white ad\u00ad ministration, Tufts initiated an African American studies program and the African American Cultural Center, Hill explained. During its first few years of operation , said Hill, who has just completed a six month self\u00ad orientation study of the center's past and future goals, the Afro center focused on the differences between the black experience and that of mainstream Amertca. However, now, she. explained another major goal of the Afro Center is to \"create an at\u00ad mosphere of community among Blacks a.t Tufts that will lead to mutual support, sharing and development of the entire community.\" Students Are Different \"I think the kind of black student enrolled in Tufts now is very different from the social and political acfivist students who helped form this center,\" she said. \"Their interests are the same but the methods they use to promote those interests are different.\" Therefore , she continued, the center must adapt to their new methods. \"The center has always reflected the changes in attitudes that have taken place in this (Continued on page 23) Page Three Lecturers warn of atomic waste hazards; protest broken treaties, economic chains Carmichael Leventhal warnS of atomic cites need for Black unity proliferation, reactor By JEFFRE)' KINDLER \"The heart of the nuclear proliferation problem is an ill\u00ad informed public,\" said Paul Leventhal, a research fellow at Marvard's Program for Science and Cnternational Affairs and at the Brookings Cnstitution, in a lecture Monday sponsorednby the Tufts Council on International Affairs.

Therefore , he noted that the way to combat it is to destroy capitalism altogether . Carmichael used strong language in his speech, calling capitalism a \"vicious, stupid system\" repeatedly , and describing it as a system that \"exploits without mercy\" with a . policy of \"profit by any means necessary.\" He pointed out numerous examples of this in American history, starting with the forced removal of land from the Indians, through slavery, and up until the Vietnam War.

Means cited as the three major enemies of the native American , the United States government the present educational system, and Christianity . Charging the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs with propogating repressive policies, Means claimed that Indian people are used as testing grounds for governmental ex\u00ad perimentation. As an example, Means stated that 42 percent of all Indian women\u00b7 have\u00b7 been sterilized while the average life span of all Indians is only 44.5 years. \u00b7 Claiming that the education in this country \"reinforces in\u00ad stitutionalized racism,\" Means recalled the confusion of his son when told in the first grade that George Washington was the father of his country. Said Means \"Washington sure doesn't look like my daddy.\" Means criticized Christianity for what he called its missionary tactics and its tacit approval of governmental policies that helped to reduce the 1492 Indian population of 12 million to less than 250,000 by 1900. \"Although we don't quarrel about religon itself, we do quarrel over the use of it,\" said Means.

We're indicative of society's attitude as a whole. People here like to be buffered. I often ask questions in class students don't want to hear. Some people don't want to deal with me.\" The questions Gralla, an Engineer working on a plan of study, most often asks \"come down to responsibility for what you do: lifestyle changes, sharing of visions,\" he says. His radical ideology is most clearly and im\u00ad portantly concerned with the issues of food and nutrition which he believes are at the heart of many national and in\u00ad ternational political and social problems. Gralla has pursued his interest in food in an unusual number and variety of activities on and off the Tufts campus. In his three years in Medford, he has run the Tufts Hunger Action Project, led a freshman exploration, helped organize and lead both the \"Full Moon\" food cooperative and the Healthy Snack Bar, written pamphlets and directories, given lectures, and acted as a guru for many members of the Tl\u00b5'ts community interested in the implications of what they eat. -\"People often come to me with a lot of questions,\" Gralla says, \"and I guess I do prosletyze . My work is to make people aware of what they're eating\u00ad where it has come from, its ramifications to the people picking and - preserving it, the role of those who '( .i.market it, and what it does to your \u00b7 -body.\" 'An undeI:Standing of these;, -things, he says, has letl him to \"tack on political reasons\" to his eight-year vegetarianism. He...traces his original \"conversion\" to being \"initially repulsed by meat. In junior high school, my parents took me out to a \"Steak and Brew\" and ordered lobster and steak. I took one look at JJ them when they came to the table and wouldn't eat them. I had water in\u00ad stead.\" He has not eaten meat since. \"By not eating meat, I'm showing people they can break what Frances Moore Lappe, author of Diet for a Small Planet, calls the \"Great American SteakReligion\"in her forthcoming Food First. People won't die from vegetarianism; they are being ad\u00ad vertised into eating meat,\" he says. One of Gralla's chief activities at Tufts has been the Full Moon Coop which he co-founded last summer. The Coop is an \"organization of about 100 united heads devoted to buying our food as cheaply as possible, \" as its literature proclaims . On large bulletin boards at its headquarters on Whitfield Road and in Eaton Lounge, the Coop outlines its \"master food list\" as well as \"specials of the week.\" Gro\u00b7ups of \"cohorts\" deliver and package the goods and supervise weekly distribution of the food to coop mem\u00ad bers. Gralla, in addition to co-authoring the Coop's constitution and contacting its suppliers , is one of three members of the \"Central Committee\" that leads the organization. \"The lineage between producer and consumer is unjust. For a farm worker in Honduras to be paid 40 cents for every 100 weight of bananas picked and for me to pay 20 cents a pound-for his pickings is ridiculous Agribusiness firms are feeding themselves money. Therefore. we at \u00b7that Coop cut out the middle man,\" ,Gralla says. \"By working together, buying together, and sharing togetller we can buy food in quantity from wholesalers at wholesale prices, realizing a con\u00ad siderable savings on our food ex- \u00abpenditures. In addition, we buy food 'Friday, March 4, 1977 , from its sources as much as possible\u00ad the Chelsea market, \"for example-to avoid packaging,\" as written in the Cooo constitution. The Healthy Snack Bar Collective, a two year project rCm by five students, one of whom is Gralla, sells nutritional but \"tasty\" snacks in Eaton Lounge during the week from 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Fralla says half of the Snack Bar's profits go for small salaries for its workers and the other half is sent to Oxfam America, a national organization devoted to increasing public consciousness of and philan\u00ad thropy for international hunger and famine. \"Last semester,\" says Gralla, \"we sent $700 to Oxfam and we made several additions to the menu of things people wanted to eat.\" Oxfam was the organization through which Gralla first became politically involved in the food issue. In junior high school, he raised $5000 for Oxfam through \"begging and fundraising \" including two annual fasts at his school. Shortly thereafter , he participated in the American Freedom from Hunger Foundation's Young World Develop\u00ad ment which sponsored \"Walks for Development\" across the country. Grana was one of two coordinators of a 50 member student group that raised over $50,000 in each of two waiks 0 ''Nexus got to be.known all over the country,\" Gralla recalls, \"and its split\u00ad off from YWD led to similar split-0ffs in the entire northeast region, eventually encouraging the dissolution of YWD. While the March of Dimes and similar groups tried to organize walks, we had the support of local newspapers and industry. Where the March of Dime~ had an overhead greater than 20 per\u00ad cent, ours was less than three-tenths of a percent.\" ! ' Gralla says he\u00b7 has been active politically since seventh grade when he worked on recycling for a local en\u00ad vironmental group. But his real ac\u00ad tivism was stirred, he remarks, by his ninth grade \"Contemporary Problems \" teacher who awakened his interest in international social conflicts. At Tufts, he joined the Hunger Action Project that grew, in 1973, out of Tufts' first participation in National Food Day. \"I tried to carry Hunger Action for the next year,-\" he says, \"But it fell apart. Energy and directions were scattered and uncoordinated. There was little sharing of views. Finally, there was a virtual dissolution thanks in part to the bureaucratic Senate.\" Gralla is now helping to rebuild fhe Project.

His philosophy is too elitist; he is interested in grad students, professors and ex\u00ad perts. His lectures are usually geared to them. Giving one lecture and one Mass Talk to the undergraduates \u00b7is not enough. There are more than 30 people here seriously interested in the ' field of nutrition with no place to study. He won't talk to them unless they've had organic chemistry,\" charges Gralla. Gralla confronted Mayer at a Mass Talk last fall on the issue of the president's association with Miles Laboratories and Monsanto Cor\u00ad poration. \"We got totally confused and he wound me around his finger for a while. What I'd like to know is: What role can academic researchers like Mayer fulfill in examining corporate nutritional failures when they are being paid through grants given by these companies:\" Gralla b lieves that non-nutrition experts must be familiar with all ~spects offood issues. \"When you buy a piece of food,\" he contends, \"you have to think about where it is coming from, where it is going, and how it is affecting your body.\" Gralla claims he keeps his body \"in check\" with periodic fasts. ''There are certain signs your body needs things, that you're eating too much. With a fast. you have a brand new start. It's a physiological type of meditation that keeps you in touch with your body and yourself. \" Gralla's longest fast was eight days but he fasts irregularly. 1Sometimes he fasts once a week, sometimes he goes several months without fasting. Last fall, he fasted for five days as part of a project for an Ex-College class in ex\u00ad perimental physiology . With the cooperation of University Health Services, he kept detailed records of his physiological activity. During a fast, . he feels \"a lot mor.e energized. With the proper mental attitude, you can do it easily and it's worth it,\" he says. Elliot Gralla is a strong believer in radical social change. He advocates cooperative societies for sharing and working together. Last summer, he hitchiked around the country looking at people's coops. In Teluride, Colorado, he stopped for three days to \"smooth out some problems a storefront coop was having. I believe in the whole idea 9,i't of helping coops.'' \u00b7 \"My type of view is accepted in the nutritional world even if Mayer may think I'm crazy,\" says Gralla. He cites Mary Goodwin, a radical nutritionist for whom he worked in Washington, DC last Christmas. There he prepared a guide to food programs in Montgomery County for the local public health department. He is currently working on a similar booklet to serve the needs of residents of Medford and Somerville as well as the Tufts community. He has also prepared a pamphlet on iron that he will offer to the health department of cities near Tufts. lltimately , Elliot Gralla has his own vision of society. \"I would eliminate the profit motive but keep capitalism. Give people enough to survive and have the rest go to social service. Develop a capitalist system that is socially responsive. Now, our whole directions are totally wrong.\" Meanwhile , Gralla keeps \"working for change, for responsibility . I have idealism-a society of coops may be a dream-but I like to get down to a realistic level, a rationalist approach . I'm a good fund raiser and I think I get people to think about things_;, YWD had too higI:i an overhead and was \"Mayer's attitude toward things is \u00b7 Says Gralla: \"I'm very lucky in that I have a positive outlook on life.

Now m its t~rrd year, Gralla does not agree with Mayer's Nexus, whose name was derived from philosophy. \"Nutrition involves science the Greek word for \"link\" and whose and technology as well as the other p~pose, says Gral.la, is to link the side: sociology, politics, things .in- m1ddle and oppressed classes, raised volving the layman: Mayer doesn't $29,000 from sponsors of 2300 walkers want to talk about the other side and he its first year.

I don't want to, I'm happy about it. I have no sympathy for people ,who don't question.\" Page Five r tuftshorts Students give blood in Curtis Curtis Lounge was tran\u00ad sformed into a temporary Red Cross donation center last Tuesday and Wednesday , when students and faculty members each donated about 45 minutes of their time to donate blood. The two day affair was organized by sophomore Robin Carton, and sponsored by the Committee on Student Life (CSL). \"The blood drive was very successful . We hoped to receive 300 pints of blood and we nearly did,\" Carton explained. \"The drive yielded 'l:72 pints, 112 on Tuesday and 159 pints on Wed\u00ad nesday.\" There is currently a short supply of blood in the greater Boston area, Carton said, and the winter has put a serious strain on the blood surpous; 1300 units of blood are used each day, and hospitals in the metropolitan area are experiencing slight shortages , she said. The temporary clinic will return to Tufts next November. New rules for Ex Col advisors .. Guidelines re-defining the role of faculty advisors in the Experimental College have been issued, according to John Coyle, a board member of the Ex-College. Coyle said that the new guidelines would require faculty advisors to attend exploration meetings and to hold regular sessions with the student leaders of the explorati on. \"This change will allow f11culty advisors to interact more closely with students,\" Coyle said. \"These changes are prescriptive rather than proscriptive, but we hope that the new guidelines will allow advisors to feel more com\u00ad fortable in their new role and allow them to help the fresh\u00ad men in their exploration, \" he added. Coyle said that applications for peer teaching would be available on March 4th and must be returned by April 1. \"Peer teaching is imoortant with respect to what the Ex\u00ad College wapts to accomplish. We encourage those with an interest and those who feel they can offer something to apply,\" Coyle said. Last semester, Coyle said the Experimental College sponsored 24 explorations serving 300 freshman and had to turn away an additional 100 interested new people. TCB elects new exec hoard Six members of the Tufts Concert Board were elected to its executive board at a meeting Tuesday night in Carmichael Lounge. The new officers are juniors Dexter Lavour, Wendell Anderson, Ed Ingalls and Bill Loughlin, sophomore David Baird and freshman Chris Halliburton. Prior to the election of of\u00ad ficers, the concert board adopted two charter revisions that expanded its executive board from five to six members . The board also agreed that the officers would fill six posts: production manager, booking, tickets, promotions, security and finance. The general board also charged the executive com\u00ad mittee with the responsibility of making final reV1s1ons in the Tufts Concert Board's charter before April 12. The new executive board will work cooperatively with the present board in planning for March 31 Blackbird concert. At the meeting, the executive board also reported that it lost a few hundred dollars on last week's David Bromberg concert due to the small capacity of Cohen Auditorium . Tufts grad to speak on MH Janet Staub, a representative from the Elizabeth Stone House Collective, an alter\u00ad native mental health com\u00ad munity and refuge center for women, will speak on March 8 at 8 p.m. in Eaton 101. The meeting, sponsored by the Women's Center, will serve as an informational session and an organizing meeting for those interested in working at Stone House. Janet Staub, a Tufts graduate and a member of the Elizabeth Stone House Collective, said, \"Our goal is to provide a supportive , non\u00ad oppressive environment where women in crisis can safely take responsibility for their own lives. We serve women who are either in a temporary acute crisis or women \u00b7 who are in a chronically bad lifestyle and need a safe non-pressured space where they can begin to change their situations .\" According to Gail Ko plow, director of the Women's ' Center, people who have worked with the Stone House in the past have been able to incorporate what they have learned into independant study programs or research papers. More information can be obtained from the Women's Center. Rationale given for tuition hike Faculty and worker pay in\u00ad creases were cited by Student Representative to the Trustees John Jackson as the major cause for next year's $350 tuition hike. Meeting informally with mem\u00ad bers of the Senate, Jackson ex\u00ad plained that fears of faculty unionization and pressures to maintain salary levels com\u00ad mensurate with other schools were central in the decision to grant the faculty a 7.5 percent raise. Jackson also said that the need for an increase in the financial aid budget, the \"laundry list\" of addred programs, and the need for more teaching assistants were considered in the tuition increase. The increase in the size of the financial aid budget is also in\u00ad tended to help Tufts compete with schools that have been able to outbid the university for students, said Jackson. He noted that last fall, Tufts lost a number of prospective students to Harvard and Brown because Tufts' financial aid packages could not equal those offered by those schools. The so-<:alled \"laundry list\" includes improvements in women's athletic facilities, the expansion of the freshman writing and career guidance programs and the development of faculty research facilities, ac\u00ad cording to Jackson. Jackson advised the Senate that effective attempts to curb the tuition increase must focus on one issue at a time. He also emphasized the need to take students' values into account when consider\"ing which _ programs are to be cut back and which programs are to remain. Jackson concluded by saying that the finance committee had for the first time taken steps to prevent drastic tuition increases in the future. They plan to for\u00ad mulate a projected income and expense budget for the next two years meant to head off unex\u00ad pected expenditures, he added. Doctor-athlete speaks here \"Doctors have a habit of being human; once they've made\u00b7 it. out the slum, they don't want to go back,\" Dr. Delano Merriwhether said last Wednesday night in a speech sponsored by the Tufts Afro\u00ad American Society. Merriwhether, director of the National Influenza Program , spoke to 30 people concerning \"The Delivery of Health Services to Minorities and the Poor.\" He also discussed a. variety of other topics, including medical school admissions for minorities, socialized medicine , and National Health Insurance. Merriwhether focused on the problem of doctors from poor backgrounds who, after they receive their training, do not return to areas that need adequate health care. His proposed solutions include making service in poor areas a mandatory part of in\u00ad ternship or, possibly, part of medical school programs. Merri whether, who is also a nationally known track sprinter ,-is widely known in me'dical circles for his research on blood\u00b7 Compiled by Woody Cornog, Ann Everds, Ellen Pert, Neal Shapiro, Ann White Efficiency _effort underway at TCU senate By SCOTT THURM Revised decentralized budgeting procedures highlighted the opening weeks of the T. C. U. Senate's term under Chairperson Paul Davis. The new system was instituted in order to \"free the Senate from mindless haggling,\" Davis explained . The new procedure. delegates responsibility for control of the Senate's \"buffer.fund \" during the year to\u00b7 the Senate Financial Committee instead of the entire Senate, according to the Financial Committee (Fin Com) member Alan Simon. He also said the Senate maintains the fund, which represents the un-distributed portion the Student Activity Fee, for ad-hoc ex\u00ad penditures These include \"ex\u00ad penditures for groups. not in\u00ad cluded in the original budget and additional expenditures for groups already budgeted,\" Simon added. The Financial Committee which now controls the \"buffer fund\" is composed of council chairpeople of each of the 11 councils that the Senate uses for its b!dgeting process, and ~:--~\"' Treasurer Kevin Bovie. The reason for this change, according to Davis, was to have \"informed people making the decisions\" for a very complex budget system. Davis maintains that, \"the results of the new process have been \"excellent.\" At last Sun\u00ad day's meeting, the Senate was able to finish all its business in less than an hour. Simon said this was possible because \"We spent spent hours on Saturday fighting over the recommendations .\" Sunday, the Senate after very limited debate simply approved all of the proposed appropriations by an almost unanimous vote. Those recommendations in\u00ad cluded a $400 appropriation to the Stage Band for the down payment on a piano, and $295 for increased operating ocsts to the Tufts Council on International Affairs. Other appropriations included $50 to the American Society of Civil Engineers for a speaker and $260 to the Alternate Film Series. The Fin-Com tabled a request from the Course Evaluations Committee that Davis said will be taken up at this week's meeting. Davis also said the Senate has made an attempt at increased efficiency in one other area by the formation of a screening panel to interview prospective speakers at Senate meetings which will meet 30 minutes before the regular Senate meeting. According to the new plan, Davis said students who wish to speak at Senate meetings must complete a form which is available at Eaton Lounge, and bring it to the screening panef meeting. The, screening panel consists of Assistant Parliamentarian Jim Deveau and Secretary Kim Vydra. Davis maintains that \"this will also help make the Senate meeting shorter and more efficient.\" In addition, the Senate has tentatively arranged two meetings to be held the week after vacation between students and Trustees . The Senate voted to support the effort of the baseball and lacrosse teams to hold a \"cause\" dinner to raise money for their spring trip to Florida. Work set for temporary student center (Continued from page 3) prime concern was to move \"very fast\" on the tran\u00ad sformation project. On Wed\u00ad nesday, after what one source termed an \"extremely long\" meeting with Vice President for Business Affairs John Mitchell, Mayer said he decided against commissioning a second report on the matter and directed Mitchell and Ketchen to proceed along the \"general lines\" of the original report with a simple plan for the renovation. \"We are going to do everything we can without affecting the structure of the building,\" Mayer said. He added that holding down the cost q_f the Page Six plan is important , since the building will serve only as a temporary center. Mayer said that the first step in the pians will be to establish cost estimates for each of the planned changes. The original report lacked cost estimates or feasibility projections . Mayer declined to state what will be included in the center but ad\u00ad mitted \"there will be some sort of food service but it will not be very elaborate .\" Mayer stated that his major concern was \"not to spend too much time in preperation,\" but he declined to specify a date for the start of construction. Mayer also said that he planned to \"push as fast as we can\" on the instalJation of a pub in MacPhie but he declined to reveal a timetable on that project, as well. In the Observer 's poll this week the most frequent response to the open-ended question \"What would you like to see in a tem\u00ad porary student center in Eaton Lounge?\" was more chairs. Also high on the list were the ad\u00ad ditional tables, and expansion of the TV and stereo facilities. The only item mentioned by over 20 percent of the respondents which appears to require a large ex\u00ad penditure was the addition of food facilities. Observer Typical of the students who commented was junior Temis Delepena who said \"I don't see another TV set,\" and then added, everything, but I would like to see another TV set,\" and thn added, \"I think a snack bar is ex\u00ad cellent idea.\" Gesing's proposal, entitled \"Eaton Lounge ... A proposition and rationale\" is a detailed version of the report submitted by his committee a few weeks ago. It includes a summary of his own interest in the center, a description of the present en\u00ad vironment in Eaton, including in what areas the lounge is deficient, an outline and rationale for proposed structural changes, and a deta,iled explanation of each of the seven items that appeared in the original report. Gesing said he hoped that Winant would forward the report to Mayer, however Gesing made the statement before Mayer's decision Wednesday afternoon . Gesing also said he expects to send to Winant proposals recommending better use of libraries other than Wessell and .the possible use of some classrooms in Eaton for study rooms at night. Friday, March 4, 1977 arts Bromberg off stage: no demon ID disguise ( The following is excerpted from a con\u00ad versation Danny Herman had with David Bromberg shortly before Bromberg took the stage last Saturday.) Observer: Many of your songs, such as \"Demon in Disguise\" and \"Danger Man\". make you sound like a real bad guy or someone who people better not fool around with. How much of that is your real self-~ image, or is it all a put-0n? Bromberg: That's got to be somebody's inferiority feelings. I think that's pretty obvious. Anybo.dy who talks about himself that way a lot obviously has a lot of feelings that he's not like that at all. Observer: But you'd like to be? Bromberg: I think I've cooled out a bit. A funny little kid with glasses has got to find some excuse. Observer: What about your song \"Will Not Be Your Fool\"? Bromberg: That tune was not written to a woman. It was written to an \u00b7audience, an audience that wanted me to be their jukebox. It's kind of silly to write a song called \"Will Not Be Your Jukebox,\" and just don't tell me what to sing because the only people who can really identify with what you're feeling are other singers who get screamed at to play \"Three Blind Mice\" or whatever people shout at you. So I thought of it in more universal terms and wrote the song that way. interview Observer: At your concerts, the audience seems to get more involved with you as a performer than with many other musicians who do the concert circuit. Do you try to plan out your show in order t~ facilitate audience involvement? ; Bromberg: It doesn't happen in a vacuum. I don't plot out a set to lay on people. We go up there and I know what I'm going to play first and after that it's whatever feels like should come next. Those feelings come from myself the way the band is playing, and the way the audience is responding . I used to decide on a first and last song but \u00b7 now Ileave the last one up in the air. Observer: Which of your albums do you like the best? - Bromberg: My last two are the only two I like. I don'tlike the first three. The singing is so much better on the last two ... The new one (How Late'll Ya Play Til?) really cooks and in a lot of ways is my favorite but there's a mood thing about Midnight on the Water which I really like. It's the only one with a real sustained mood all the way through. The others all jump around. Observer: How did you improve your voice so much? Bromberg: By singing a lot and on my last album I was taking voice lessons which helped a lot. Observer: Since you've started to devote more time to singing_ and playing other instruments, how has it affected your guitar playing? . Bromberg: It has its ups and downs. Obviously if I put all that energy into my guitar playing, I'd be a better guitar player than I am today. But in a way it has \"I don't plot out a set to lay on people .We go up there and I know what I'm going to play first and after that it's whatever feels like should come next.\" kind of solidified some things. I'm a lot rriore solid if not always as inventive. Observer: Isn't travelling and performing every night exhausting? Why do you do it? Bromberg : The travel is very exhausting but the playing isn't. The reason we do a show just about every night is basically economic. There are seven musicians , two equipment managers, one road manager, one light women, plus two sound guys and , a bus driver. It's a whole lot of people. All those people are paid salaries, plus room and board. Now if we don't work for a night that means we're spending a lot of money and getting nothing in return. So we've got to play. as many nights as we can without killing ourselves, although every now and then it gets pretty incredible. But it's nothing we can't all handle. Observer : Why do you go on tour in the first place? Bromberg: I love playing for people. I think I enjoy playing live more than recording, although it's apples and pears; which do you like more-apples or pears!? If I had to give up one or the other I'd. probably give up recording before I'd give up playing live. Observer: Is it true that music is your only hobby? Bromberg : Pretty much although I do love to watch basketball games. I used to play but I injured my knee. I'm a big Knick fan .. . Wait 'til expensive Haywood comes back and Lonnie Shelton can really do it. They're gonna have an incredible front line: Shelton, Tom McMillen, who I think is the most underrated player in the league, Haywood , McAdoo, and the other McMillan who I'm not so wild about. They've got Mo Layton who I thin)c is the future of the Knicks. Ticky Burden sometimes looks good and Monroe can still do it ... Observer: When you're not touring, do you still Jive in New York? Bromberg: Well I think Haywood and Shelton are the two keys because they're the two muscle guys. McAdoo is big but he doesn't like to be right underneath the basket ... Observer : Back when you were a student at Columbia , what made you decide to drop out ot become a professional musician? Bromberg: I had always wanted to but I _didn't have the courage to. I finally\u00b7 decided that if I didn't give it a try, I'd regret it for the rest of my life. I would always be reproaching mvself for not having given it a shot.So I figured if I was gonna fall on my face, I'd fall on my face. But whatever it was, I wanted it to be my attempt. From that point on, I've never looked back. Bromberg onstage: spontaneous and super By DANNY HERMAN David Bromberg is a masterful musician as well as an electrifying per\u00ad former who possesses an almost magical ability for enthralling an audience. Last Saturday night, he and his fine band worked their magic for an adoring, standing-room only crowd at Cohen Auditorium . Bromberg 's musical tastes are so diverse as to make his music impossible to classify. He combines dixieland, bluegrass.country, blues, folk, jazz, and rock'n'roll and comes out with a synthesis . concert which is distinctively Bromberg . Perhaps he could be called contemporary music's foremost renaissance man. A brief look at his background may partially explain his eclecticism . After studying musicology at Columbia \u00b7 University for less than two years, Bromberg dropped out in order to devote all his time to playing music. He was drawn to Greenwich Village which was at time (the mid-60's) the center of the folk music scene. By then he had become scmething of a guitar virtuoso and quickly came to the Friday, March 4, 1977 attention of many other musicians : Bob Dylan, Ringo Starr, Mississippi John Hurt, the Reverend Gary Davis, Tom Faxton, Chubby Checker, and Jay and the Americans are only a few of the notables who sought Bromberg out as a back-up musician for record dates. In all he has played as sideman on over 75 albums. In 1970, Bromberg embarked on a solo career.Between 1970 and 1975,he did four albums for Columbia Records: David Bromberg, Demon in Disguise , Wanted Dead or Alive, and Midnight on the Water. His most recent album, a part-live, two\u00ad record set entitled How late'll Ya Play 'Til? was released last fall on the Fantasy label. In the last several year. Bromberg 's musical abilities have broadened significantly . No longer merely a guitar wiz with a painful-to-listen-to voice, Bromberg has mastered dobro, mandolin , and fiddle as well as having improve his voice greatly. In addition, he is a capable songwriter and arranger . The over two-hour show Bromberg did at Cohen was packed with musical energy and good humor. He started with \"Get'Up .and Go,\" an \u00b7 original \"newgrass\" tune which segued into a medley of fiddle tunes.Here Bromberg and rhythm guitarist Dick Fegy took the opportunity to join their fiddler George Kindler to forri1 a three fiddle line. After this, they quickly changed moods with an electric blues called \"Sloppy Drunk,\" extolling the virtues of bourbon. During this song, someone from the audience presented Bromberg with a quart of Jack Daniels which he oroceeded to swig out of and then amaze everyone by using the bottle as a slide during his guitar solo. It was vintage Bromberg and the audience loved every minute of it. They then went through some of their standards including \"Send Me to the 'Lectric Chair\" which featured a sax solo by John Payne, (a former member of Bromberg 's band and now a solo artist) who had dropped by unexpectedly . \"Nobody's Fault But Mine\" and \"900 Miles\" were fine examples of Bromberg 's talent for updating traditional folk songs. At one point, Bromberg sent the band off-stage for a rest while he silenced the audience with a moving rendition of \"Dehlia.\" The band returned and laun\u00ad ched into a charged version of the old .Coasters'. \u00b7 \"Idol with the Golden Head.\" Another high point was the melancholy ballad \"Nobody's,\" in which Payne played a subtly stirring, jazz-tinged flute solo. Bromberg ended with \"Will Not Be Your Fool,\" a rocking blues which the crowd Observer had been yelling for all night, and then returned for two encores. Undoubtedly , the band which Bromberg has asserobled deserves much of the credit for making the show what it was. I was constantly impressed by their individual virtuosity as well as their ability to play so well together during each number. This is especially astounding con\u00ad sidering Bromberg 's .repetoire contains over 150 songs, any of which he may call on them to play on a given night. In addition to Fegy and Kindler, the band is made up of Curt Linberg on Trombone , John Firmin on Saxes, flute and pennywhistle , Hugh McDonald on electric bass and vocals, and Steve Mosley on drums and vocals. But in the end, it is David Bromberg himself who is most remarkable . He is a performer who is, at all times, totally in control of his music as well as the audience. Since he shaved his beard, he looks less like a crazed rabbinical student than he once did, but there is still craziness there. He is not handsome, but somehow he is very attractive . Perhaps it is his distinc\u00ad tive brand of self-disparaging humor which makes him so endearing. Whatever it is, something very special is there which you ought to treat yourself to if you haven't already. \u00b7 Page Seven arts 'Bound for Glory': a different side of Woody By GARY PALMUCCI What if they made a movie about Woody Guthrie and nobody cane'! That seems to be what is happening to Bound for Glory, an intelligent , meticulously detailed and beautifully shot recreation of four early years (c. 1936-40) in the life of America's original protest singer. I mention this by way of introduction because I think that Bound for Glory is eminently worth seeing, one of the few recent American films that's a real labor of love, if not without some attendant flaws as well. But the reasons why the movie hasn't caught on in New York or Los Angeles, where it opened three months ago, are as problematic as whether it will now do any better elsewhere as a result ohts six Oscar nominations, including one for best picture. At this point, they're irrelevant as well: it's up to you. Most of us, I imagine, have some idea of who Woody Guthrie was in the pantheon of American popular music, and of the profound influence he had on more contemporary artists, particularly Bob Dylan. But Bound , for Glory isn't really concerned with Woody Guthrie's musical legacy or in portraying him as a figure who was bound for legendary status from the outset of his travails. Director Hal Ashby, screenwriter Robert Getchell and cinematographer Hascell Wexler have attempted to establish a time and place in which an otherwise ordinary, street-smart but rather head\u00ad strong and selfish young man found an outlet for his uncanny way of self-expression, his songs. The leisurely, natural flow of that story makes the movie engaging and unique. David Carradine stars as young Woody, and in what must have been considered a high-risk stroke of casting in many Hollywood circles, he delivers a terrific, totally unaffected per\u00ad formance . I would rank it just shy of Robert DeNiro's in Taxi Driver as the best of 1976, for it's such a sustained, intense, yet subtle metamorphosis that he brings off. His Woody is a figure of both unheroic intransigence and poetic insight that only a good scriptwriter could properly balance. In other words, the character is the filmmakers' interpretation , and the actor's too, but one which is virtually devoid of hero-worship or in\u00ad congruity . We first come upon Guthrie; Carradine in his native Texas dustbowl town, a hovel devastated by the Depression of which he is the unemployed , eccentric scion. He likes to strum a guitar. He makes various impressions upon a passing\u00ad through, affluent oil man; a stubborn, sick, dehydrating old women; his beleagured wife and family; and a behemoth n:amed 'Heavy' Chandler , the local \"insane man,\" who tells Woody he's got a gift, he's got newsreels in his head. Woody gives him paint and brushes, tells him to go put it all down on paper. Time passes. \"Guess things just ain't so good around here no more,\" he keeps muttering, to no one in particular but himself. One day he gets up and walks off toward California. In this crucial early section bf the picture, a characteristic tone is created. Woody's natural in\u00ad difference and / or wisdom are at odds with the people in his life,be they his patiently loving wife (played by Melinda Dillon) or just any ornery townfolk. His impulse to leave everything doesn't spring from any linear set of emotions. Ashby catches the moment of decision with a beautifully measifre<I\" pan back and forth along Woody's im\u00ad penetrable, guitar-plucking , front-porch gaze. Then, like most of our own impulses, it's done. During his often brutal trek west, there's a suggestion of arbitrariness in Woody's sur\u00ad viving boxcar brawls, sadistic rail guards-even bullets: a friend is picked off the top of a train as he stands up to celebrate his escape. Woody stays on his belly, and keeps going. Once he arrives in migrant-teeming California, the suggestion per\u00ad sists: in his 'discovery ' by singer and union organizer Ozark Bule <Ronny Cox); in his dispute with radio sponsors over the content of many of his songs; and in his relationships with women, particularly a rich young lady (Gail Strickland) who provides free food for the hobo jungle, and his wife, who eventually rejoins Wootly, albeit temporarily, in Los Angeles. By arbitrariness, I mean that Guthrie's successes and failures, both material and Woody Guthrie [David Carradine] meets Pauline Jackson [Gail Strickland], a wealthy volunteer wor~er in Bound for Glory, now playing at the Sack Charles. 1 k comes to being a polemic, and its spintu1al, are mt~e J0 00 d integration into the central mood natura ' 1;1ncon rive . an f the story remains sometimes even unexplainable. 0 f bl Something like the real thing. qu1es Ifonat ~t\u00b7 h h n ac , 1 s w en Bound for Ashby amply demonstrates t e GI t t th lif f sorts of injustices that inspired Wordy ,ge S I~ O e r t~c~ .

Art and housekeeping mix in I .C.A. exhibit ByCHARLESSCHWEFEL An exhibition of recent pain\u00ad tings by Sandi Slone, a member of the Museum School faculty, will be on view at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston through March 13. Slone has re\u00ad defined the arts of painting and housecleaning by combining elements of both. Her result has been pronounced by Kenworth Moffett as \"th~ discovery and exploitation of a new way of combining paint and canvas.\" Are you ready? After laying each huge canvas on the floor, Slone \"unites\" it wit,h a heavily weighted acrylic paint using ... a push-broom for q brush! One might say that such a clean technique would have a sweeping effect, eh what? , A tenuous connection is drawn by Moffett, in the show's art catalogue , between Slone's broom -technique and \"the revolutionary drip-technique of Jackson Pollock. Both artists utilize an approach to the medium which emphasizes the two-dimensional surface of the canvas. Yet Pollock and his drips were revolutionary for another reason: he invented Action Painting. Every splash and swish makes you aware of the vigorous activity and energy that went into the act of creation. This is not the case, however, with Slone's push-technique, perhaps due to the large size and Page Eight But is it art? uniform character of the push\u00ad broom itself. The energy required by the act of painting 1s not visibly demonstrated in the works. Each painting presents large color areas that bespeak a consistently mellow and relaxed intensity of energy and action. Which is, I daresay, infinitely more desirable than the heated frenzy of Action Painting, and so accounts for much of the success of Slone's work. The quietude and purity of the compositions is no doubt due to the simplicity of her technique: pushing and pulling the paint laterally across the surface from either side of the Observer canvas, Slone leaves a large, crudely modulated \"seam\" which divides the canvas from top to bottom. This seam-like effect contrasts the continuous linearity of the broom-stroke to create vigor and life within the composition . The technique facilitates a natural, almost unavoidable emphasis upon the two\u00ad dimensiona1nature of the picture surface, a relationship which became an ugly obsession with the Abstract Expressionists . Color, line, and brushstroke are essentially unified, in that each bristle provides a textured line across the canvas as it transmits color. The paintings are not entirely \"flat\", however, since each is the result of numerous textured layers of color and glaze. With all this purification of style and medium, the only room left for creativity is in the use of color, and coloristicaily, Slone is no slouch. In Rondo, color is enlivened by the juxtaposition of complimentary hues as well as by an overall color scheme which runs the spectral gamut from red through yellow to blue in minute nuances of exquisite subtlety and delicacy . Moreover , Slorie focuses her attention on par\u00ad ticular colors, such as in Aleph <;n1\u00b711. where the possible shades of green are explored in an even greater variety and richness. All of these various effects are most eloquently articulated in a work entitled Stalking the Giants, which I consider Slone's chef-' d'oeuvre. The entire composition stands on a firm foundation of earth tones, such as umber and sienna, upon which Slone has constructed a fascinating composition of cool and warm colors. The lower section of the piece is dominated by cool green and blue hues which optically recede from the viewer, while the upper section comes forward with warm red and orange tonalities. This gives the viewer the sen\u00ad salon of being enveloped by a soft, luscious embrace of light and color. Monet would be proud of such a coloristic achievement. The characteristic surface lines are here intensified by a smoky, textural effect which looks like steam of fog rising up the canvas. Thus the depth of the color layering is more effectvely expressed, in addition to a fur\u00ad ther articulation of the surface lines by small bulges and ripples. Watery images abound in Slone's work, for example the push-pull rhythm of the broom\u00ad stroke relates well to the ebb and now of the ocean. \"It looks like a beach, Mom,\" said a vocal member of the cognoscenti small-fry. \"There's the sand, and the water, and here's the lifeguard stand,\" said he, pointing to a small, lonely blob of blue. I am heartened by this youthful enthusiast (Sean, age 5), whose spontaneous delight gives us all the more impetus to see these wonderful paintings . Friday, March 4, 1977 By SHEREE RHEINHARDT and GEORGE KALOGERAKIS SPICY FOOD: Now that Spring is here why not venture outdoors? Leave your hibernation and walk (it's really not that far) to Medford Square for lunch. There's a Chinese restaurant there, The Szechuan, on High Street across from the Medford Mercury, tnat features good food as well as extremely friendly waitresses and waiters. And the lunc_h prices just can't be beat if you consider the amount of food . ) you receive. The \"Ta-chien Chicken\" ($1.85) is a spicy adventure with fried or white rice and a spring roll. And vegetarians don't have to worry because \"Buddha 's Delight\" (also $1.85), a combination of vegetables such as broccoli, mushrooms, bean sprouts, and water chestnuts, is a delicious treat. The $1.85 also includes tea, hot and sour soup, and a fortune cookie. (That must entice you.) . If your schedule is too tight to fit in the time to go to The Szechuan for lunch, the dinner prices are just as low. You can gei; such items as \"Hunan Beef\" for $4.75, or \"Crispy Whole Fish\" for $5.50. However, the best bet of all is to wait for a Thursday or Friday evening when there is a special buffet for $3.25 from 6:30-8:30. The meal includes an appetizer and two main courses that are certainly more than enough to fill you up. And for the seasoned Chinese food fan, they have Peking Duck for $15.00, which will serve four or five people, but you have to arrange for it 24 hours in advance. The price will buy you soup as well, but you must remember to ask for it. Another good restaurant with a more rowdy atmosphere is La Pinata in Davis Square (it's a couple of doors down from the movie theater.) The cuisine is hot , if you couldn't guess. Tostadas , ($1.4()) ground beef, lettuce, and cheese inside a soft corn tortilla was a favorite. En\u00ad chiladas ( $2.25 ), a combination of chicken lettuce, and cheese inside a tortilla shell aren't bad either. Tacos, tortillas, and salad (with feta cheese and a good spicy dressing) are 75c each. Last, but not least is the guacamole. an avocado dip with chips, that is a must for a group of people to munch on while waiting for dinner. If you go on a weekend night try to get there during the off hours because it's a small place (only nine tables) and if you sit by the door, it may be a bit cold. SMILE: The Park Square Cinema is screening Charlie Chaplin's two greatest full\u00ad length films, Modem Times and City Lights, this Sunday through Tuesday, March 6-8. These films feature Chaplin the Tramp at his funny/sad best, before his films began to wallow in sentimentality. If you haven't seen these recently, go-there's nothing quite like them. STREISAND FANS: Usually reliable sources report the following information, which is of passing interest to us but may send some of you into paroxysms of delight: Streisand is negotiating with promoters to do a two-city concert tour' sometime in March-and the other city is Boston. Remember where you\u00b7 heard it first! TWO WITH NATURE: Woody Allen's new comedy will open April 20 in New York City. Allen supposedly had difficulty choosing a title, but finally settled on Annie Hall. The film, which is supposed to be semi-autobiographical , also stars Diane Keaton, Paul Simon, Carol Kane, Tony Roberts and Christopher Walken. IDEAS FOR ARTS MONTH: If there are any events you'd like included in the Arts Month Caldendar for April, remember that the deadline for submissions is Friday, March 10. Any ideas are welcome-many have been turned in already. Friday, March 4, 1977 arts Williams' 'Menagerie' glows at the Lyric Stage By PAUL DERVIS An unsettling feeling came over me as I pondered the nature of my impending review of The Glass Menagerie during the intermission last Friday night. It appeared , after the first act, that I would have to give it a negative review. Under normal cir\u00ad cumstances this wouldn't bother me, but in this case it did ... - because the play was being done very well. The acting was quite professional. The set looked as if great thought had been put intQ it. The light changes were very innovative . So what was wrong? Knowing the outcome of the play, I couldn't see how it could work. All the concepts on stage seemed to go against the mood Tennessee Williams had created. But I was wrong. The Lyric Stage's production worked, and well. My first negative response came early, before the play had even begun in fact. One of the disadvantages of the many small group theaters in and around Boston is that they are usually restricted to a three quarter arena stage. This in itself can give a unique effect of bringing the audience into the action. But when a well known play is done, then the set is just sitting there, begging to be judged out of context. This particular set was quite easy to pre-judge . The Glass Menagerie takes place in the apartment \u00b7of Amanda, Laura, and Tom.-It is difficult to conceive of the apartment as a reflection of Tom because he is so desperately , trying to break loose of the life his mother has created for him and and his sister Laura. The world of the play is the world of the women. There should be soft, delicate, sheer material reflecting Laura's character . To her, the apartment has been a lifelong womb in which her mother can protect her. But it would also have to be old and decaying, with nothing left but memories of the past, much as Amanda herself. _ Instead, the set was hard, thick and rough. The curtains were a deep red burlap; the bedspread was a dull brown; and the fur\u00ad niture was all heavy wood. The only thing resembling either of the women V(as the glas.s casing containing the glass figures. When 'the play began, I was curious to see how t~e design would be used. The production took no time in answering the question. Unlike the traditional mood of the play, which is surreal, it was done very naturally . In Tom's opening monologue , he staes that he is the closest character to reality while the others will appear as illusions. The illusion, though, does not run through the per\u00ad formance . Amanda, played by Jo Car\u00ad penter, came through as a very familiar character . She was the overbearing , cunning moher. Janet Rodgers ' portrayal of Laura was straight. Laura had an professioal job jone in any of these small companies . It was the aetor's natural appearence that made me wonder if the play would socceed, and it was that same quality that made it as powerful as it was in the end. The highest praise is held for Paul O'Brien as Tom, and Janet Rodgers. O'Brien was a delight to listen to. He had total command of the role he was playing and played it to its pinnicle without overdoing the character . Ms. Rodgers was voted tlest Amanda [ Jo Carpenter] expresses her disapproval as Tom [Paul O'Brien] angrily tells her of his plans to leave the family in search of adventure. inferiority complex , as the gentleman caller aptly stated in Act Two. The audience felt sorry for her and her inability to deal with her limp, but she was natural, not symbolic as we are accustomed to seeing her. As much as the first act alarmed me, the second held me captive. The pulse which seemed to be missing in the first act became gripping in the rest of the performance . From the moment the man whom Laura had loved from afar in high school appeared , the tension began to build and climaxed in perfect unison with the climactic act when Laura broke one of her beloved glass figures while dancing with the man. All the symbolism Williams had intended for the scene came through with remarkable in\u00ad tensity. The director had gam\u00ad bled with a unique interpretation and the gamble had paid off. It would be impossible to give the ability of the actors too much credit. It is rare to find such a Actress of 1976 by \"The Regional Review\" and \"Nightfall\" magazine and she clearly showed why. She recreated Laura completely and there was never the notion that what -the audience was seeing was only a role. Too often actors hold back their characters and visibly separate themselves from the role. It is plain to see that Ms. Rodgers would never allow herself to be guilty of that. For the production to succeed, everything had to work. The director, Polly Hogan, had an idea and the entire crew carried it out flawlessly . Seldom does one have the opportunity to see such creative work done at this level of the theater. It is a production you c~nt afford tC\\ miss. \"The Glass Menagerie\" will be running in rep. at the Lyric Stage with \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" by Oscar Wilde through March. It is performed on Fridays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 3 p.m. All seats are $4. Even Dwarves will be shown in the Hill Hall lounges ;ilnnll with Todd Browning 's Freaks.

Observer Page Nine arts Talented 'Pocket' troupe hampered by-trite scripts By MICHELE BLOCK If subtlety is the art of leaving things unspoken, then mime is certainly the subtlest of the arts. The Pocket Mime Theatre is most skillful at non-verbal!y conveying their \"messages\" - the problem is that often don'tt have all that much to say. The seven-year old company , founded by several Emerson College graduates , is currently performing at the brand-new Tower Theatre at Boston State College While their own Newbury Street is spruced up to rectify several building code violations . theatre As \"Boston's resident mime company,\" they are currently involved in a major fund raising drive that colors most their publicity material and even the program. ' The first oart. of their current show. \"Players Without Words\" consists of a selection from about ten pieces written by the four members of the company : Michael Atwell, Kate Bentley, John Girard, and J. Tormey. The best of these are the purely funny or ingenious-for instance, \"The Health Spa\" in which human bodies become bycling machines, weights, and chim-up bars. embarrassment (the human scale I a.ighs at his 98-odd lbs.) as the hapless victim of the body\u00ad building process are wonderfully exaggerated by his white face. Tomey is equally good as a staid businessman gradually infected by the delight of an exuberant butterfly catcher (Bentley). These two skits are concise, clever, and neatly make their points (or jabs) regarding what the company calls \"American themes.\" But hen the players turn to \"heavy\" statements about violence , greed, or freedom, the performers' talent can't quite compensate for an inadequate , often trite, script. In \"Chain\" a man bound by a chain finally cuts himself loose, only to return cowering to the security of his imprisonment after a brief look at the \"real\" world. Played by Tormey, who shines, the treatment of this old theme is, at least ~uccinct.Not so \"Territories, \" a predictable skit in which the three male players ~ivide the stage into individual and iripenetrable plots of spac~. Along comes Bently,who easily repels their violent attempts to oust her. After the terrified men humbly offer her progressively more of their own space, she finally indicates that the stage should be un..rnarked and free. They all strut about happily, having taught us the audience that, of course, territoriality is not as gratifying as sharing.How enlightening . Artistic Director Annegret Reimer obviously knows her mime -but the troupe needs more imaginati ve ideas to work with if, as they claim, they want to play emphasis on acting. along with the mime. These ideas are supplied by Samuel Beckett in the second half of the show, in two mime plays written by the ever-strange absurdist. The tedium, frustration, and hopelessness implicit in many oJ his works are present in abund~nce here. In \"Act Without Words I,\" a poor sou,l on a desert is con\u00ad tinually frustrated by an om\u00ad nipotent force from above, who dangles drink just out of reach and refuses to allow him quite enough shade to cool him off. It's all very tedious -but that's the point. Tormey is again convincing as the innocent dupe who naively grasps for the straw until he finally realizes that he is doomed to failure, stops trying, and, most strangely, smiles. The second Beckett piece is the better however, neatly fitting humor into Beckett's world of eternal oblivion. Bentley and Atwell are sleeping in separate black sacks as the light go up. Three members of the Pocket Mime Theatre troupe perform in Samu~l Beckett's \"Act Without Words, I.\" their best. First one and then the other, go Pocket Mime is aiming to be completely through their cute, poignant, funny -and send I \"typical day'\" of which the high a message.

Beckett -and the m1mers erwise, m \u00b7 'Oresteia ': \u00b7play plagued by identi~~cur~,:_,isis By PAUL PALMER brought home in this way, providing striking imagery as well as sound adaptation. The whole, however, is attenuated, inclining one to consider these very real successes to be isolated directoral tricks. The company perhaps enjoys it-all too much to trim it into shape. The Cambridge Ensemble 's production of the classic Greek Oresteia is an actorish work, full of pyrotechnics and breathtaking theatrical moments . These moments , regrettably, are scattered so haohazardJ.y that no workable synthesis is ever achieved. This Oresteia is a play with an identity crisis, which is in part a result of. the problems of con\u00ad version from a monumental tragic trilogy to an intimately -set two-act chamber play. The formal conventions of Greek tragedy are gone, or rather replaced by a more athletic stylization which still aims at providing aesthetic distance . What was a highly verbal medium becomes a primarily physical one, at the expense of Aeschylus' text. Alternately musical and cacaphonous , the ensemble ingeniously illustrates the plot through gesture and mime. Actors evoke the rhythmic slapping of waves and oars as Agamemnon returns to Athens, and the long-awaited signal fire racing from conquered Troy to the palace of Atreus is brilliantly conveyed by Leslie Hurley's skillful mime. All the spectacle which was so much a part of Aeschylus ' play is Page Ten It is not surprising that the Agamemnon woiyd prove most comparable length. The former is inflated, in other words, and the latter two neglected. The result is better for the actors than it is for the audience . The patient individual who is reasonably well-versed in Greek tragedy is rewarded with some fine performances, particularly in Tsai Chin's stoic and I!eptilian Clytemnestra and Tim Mc-audience behind. The script of this version, however, must shoulder most of the blame for the production's weaknesses . It is a murky and incomplete adaptation,creating as many problems as 1t solves. The gods and Furies have been eliminated, and their roles reapportioned to the shades of Agamemnon , Clytemnestra, and \"The formal conventions of Greek tragedy are gone, or rather replaced by a more athletic stylization which still aims at providing aesthetic distance.\" attractive to this group of actors, but it is unfortunat e that the same commitment could not have been brought to the Choephroe and Eumenides, the remaining plays of the trilogy. Adapting the Robert Fagles translation for performance by the talented Ensemble , Joann Green has reveled in the Agamemnon and given short. shrift to the rest. While this \u00a3-irst play of the .three forms the first act of the production , the other two are combined in a second act of Donough's manly Agamemnon . Clytemnestra 's saccharine sweetness as she inveigles her husband to tread a purple carpet, making a mockery of his return, is far more chilling than her most desperate fury.

The direction in which Ms. Green was heading is evident and very effective in such scenes as that in which the spirit of Agamemnon commands his son to murder Clytemnestra. Unfortunately, this in- terpretation scraps the conflict of Apollo and the Furies, un\u00ad dermines the significance of the tribunal, and leaves the point of it The chorus has been abolished and its functions absorbed by other characters. Orestes, ac\u00ad cording-to a program note, has actually been disguised as a slave in Athens for the past year.

In Aeschylus ' original, in which Apollo and not Agamemnon ordained his course, this would be a reasonable answer, but in this version it is riot a tittle per\u00ad plexing. Perhaps I am terribly obtuse (the point has been argued before), but I'm inclined to believe that the actors shouldn't be the only ones to fully com\u00ad prehend what it is they have in mind. In keeping with the abstraction of the acting, scenic elements are restricted to a minimum . A pair of sm~ll platforms, and a long purple cloth upon which Agamemnon treads, and in which he is snared, form the full con\u00ad tingent.Costumes are scarcely more than leotards, expressive of the starkness in which this production was conceived . It is a great pity that a company with such potential could not fulfill that promise.

The \"stage\" for the production , which was performed in Mac\u00ad Phie, consisted of multilevel platforms painted bright shades of blue, green, orange and yellow. While such an irregular arrangement can often cause staging problems , Susanne Norman and Rene Madrigal made excellent use of space in the show's choreography.

Page Eleven Sillith runs liyely classes on leftist politics and psychology By LAURA BARRETT A senior in professor Tony Smith's Marxist -Leninist course closed his notebook and, with apparent satisfaction , said, \"I can tell this is going to be an unusual course. You really have to think.\" Interest in all the courses Smith teaches at Tufts has in\u00ad creased this year despite some observers' contentions that students have politically moved further and further to the right relative to the theorists Smith discusses. Smith dismissed the idea that increased enrollment in his courses on imperialism, Marxism and underdeveloped countries shows that Tufts students are becoming more radical. make him appear younger than his 34 years. From the first day of class, students must be prepared to take a lot of notes, as he ge_ts down to business right away, talking very fast. Newcomers have been known to complain of writer's cramp after taking notes for an hour and a half. Students who are unfamiliar with the material often feel dismayed at the beginning of the semester. They have trouble keeping up. The reading load in his courses is heavy, and much of :he material is theoretical. Smith expects it to be read with great care, and analyzed incisively in clas,\u00b7 discussions and papers. Because of these demands, and becaust:! !:>1u1th ha:, a reputation \"Students want to understand the music being played, not to learn the dance themselves.\" Smith said, rather, the increase reflects a growing interest in the Soviet Union and China, and north-south relations. \"Students want to understand the music being played, not to learn the dance themselves. Of course, there are the exceptions. Usually there are a few budding Marxists in the class \" Smith said. ' Marxists and non-Marxists swell the ranks of his courses because of interest in the material that is read, Smith's energetic presentat ion of ideas, and because they admire his ability to generate worthwhile discussions in a large class. Standing in front of the class Smith looks more like a graduate student than the tenured associate professor he is. His slight build and longish, dark hair for being a hard grader (only 15 percent of the grades he gives are A's,he said), many do not sign up for his courses. Others drop out after a few classes. Those who remain, however , are en\u00ad thusiastic about ws teaching. His favorable reviews from student evaluations and by word of mouth have contributed to the in\u00ad creasing popularity of his courses. . In turn, Smith thinks highly of his students. \"By and large I think I get good students,\" he said. \"Even the ones who are not particularly bright are at least hard working.\" \u00b7 Smith's own academic in\u00ad terests have been varied. When he was an undergraduate at the University of Texas he declared no major, but took courses in a variety of fields. From Texas he ' studied political science at Harvard Graduate School. After graduating, he began teaching at Tufts. He has written two books\u00ad one on decolonization, and the other on France\u00b7 and Algeria\u00ad and has authored several ar\u00ad ticles. Last year Smith took a leave of\u00b7 absepce to research and write papers on the relations between developed and underdeveloped countries at the Lehrman In\u00ad stitute in New York.Next fall he will be taking a sabbatical to complete his research and write a book on the subject. Currently, his main interests are Latin American development problems and U .S.-Latin American relations. Two of his courses deal with these issues, though in In\u00ad ternational Relations : Im\u00ad perialism. north-south relations in the 2oth century are not discussed until the second half of the course. Smith believes that there is a growing interest in the subject since Viet Nam and OPEC showed the world that the underdeveloped countries must be reckoned with. Smith expressed concern over the fact that there are very few blacks enrolled in Imperialsim, in which material is studied that relates to oppressed peoples: the scramble for Africa and the slave trade. His course Comparativ e Politics of Developing Countries deals with the internal politics of underdeveloped countries , particularly in Latin America. He tries to show that un\u00ad derdeveloped countries are not -merely pawns of powerful foreign nations. Even the weakest countries have local customs and institutions that form a basis for their political development, he said. Smith believes that Marxism is the most humane solution to Photo by Elliott McCrory Tony Smith is a recently tenured associate professor of political science. He will be away on sabbatical next fall. problems in underdeveloped countries , where the widespread poverty can best be alleviated by industrialization . He cited Cuba as an example of a country where communism has worked, despite the hardships imposed on Cuba by the U.S. He added, \"Unfortunately , Castro has a few too many Leninist pretensions . From my point of view it is too bad that he doesn't liberalize more. Frankly, I don't know what he is so afraid , of.\" Smith said that he is more interested in studying Marxist theory than in being an activist. \"I guess you could say that I do the opposite of what Marx insists on in his 'Theses on Feurerbach ' where he says, 'The philosophers have only interpreted the world, the point, 'however, is to change it.' .,, \"On the other hand,\" he con\u00ad tinued, \"I dislike those who parade as radicals, but who don't do anything. All too often it is a cocktail party pose. Radicals have to earn that label by_being active in an ongoing movement. I can't call myself a radical because I live on Beacon Hill and I haven't done anything for anybody. \"In the U.S. there are many groups that form for specific interests, such as Gay Rights, Women's Rights, and Black Rights, but they are not political parties.

Like many others, I protested the.Viet Nam War and was involved in the civil rights movement in the sixties, but I don't consider .that being an activist~it doesn't make me a radi<:al.\" When asked if he considered himself a Marxist, Smith an\u00ad swered, \"No, I wouldn't call myself a Marxist, I think that Marx had the best explanation of . -( Continued on page 24) Yancy S. Tliompson: Tufts' Disco Master By PAULT ASKIER & TODD KESSLER The Airport parties, the Aquarium party, the Battle of the Disco Masters and various other' on and off-campus parties have one thing in common-Yancy Samuel Thompson III. Yancy Thompson is the first 'T' of TNT Productions , the group that arranged the music for the parties. In his junior year, Thompson , now a senior, formed TNT with his frined Rich Taney; hence T party, choosing just the right blend of fast and slow songs. He even keeps tapes of all fast or all slow songs so that he can ap\u00ad propriately adjust the music in line with the changing moods of the party. He says that for him \"the toughest part is deciding when to put on a slow tune.\" For his on-campus parties Yancy supplies not only the music but also sets up the am\u00ad plification system. He uses a Sansui receiver that puts out 55 watts per channel into ~hat he \"I'm far from being a professionai . ' I'm just a dg_mn good amateur.\" 'n' T. Yancy supplied the music, Taney the equipment. Since that time the disco music tapes that get everyone dancing have become a Yancy Thompson and TNT trademark . Yancy prides himself on having parties that are able \"to pull the throats out of the Gott Room.\" He feels that people \"are happy just dancing.\" Dancing is unquestionably the key to Yancy's party formula. All of his music is chosen to stimulate people to dance and keep dancing. He spends hours recording disco tunes for each Page Twelve says \"are definitely the biggest speakers on campus. They're bigger than Tufts Sound.\" They're three feet tall and two feet wide and handle up to 100 watts. But the prize piece of his system is the tape deck that unwinds his disco tunes. It is a Harmon-Kardon 2000X, and \"records better than anything I've ever heard. It is the best,\" says Yancy. Off-<:ampus, Yancy and TNT rent systems from sound cor\u00ad porations-the . same sound corporations that the Tufts Concert Board uses. Jon Cooper YANCY THOMPSON ... masterminds TNT Yancy has taken his parties off\u00ad cam pus for several reasons. Initially he found it difficult to run them in a dorm or campus facility. That problem was compounded by the absence of a license for hard liquor at Tufts. Yancy feels that \"people really want a mixed drink when they go to~ party.'' He thinks that a disco party with mixed drinks is a step above the run of the mill band and beer party. A sense of \"class\" is charac\u00ad teristic of a Yancy party. People drink and dance but they do so in suits, dresses or pants suits. Yancy turns away people that dress in cut-0ff jeans and t-shirts. It is his experience that \"when people are dressed up they're Observer cordial and easy-going. You don't have to worry about fights, broken windows, the kind of thing you worry about at a band par\u00ad ty.\" He also notes that clean-up becomes much easier. Cleaning up can also be applied to the monetary side of the operation . The last TNT Airport Party netted Yancy an'd associates more than $500 for th\\! evening's entertainment. Other people who wa11t parties run by Yancy must pay for the privilege . If they only want their music arranged by him the charge is $100. If they want him to run the entire party, \"music, booze, lighting and security,\" Yancy and TNT get $250. When accused of being a professional disco DJ Yancy replied, \"I'm far from being a professional, I'm just a damn good amateur.\" Yancy equates professionalism with not being able to make a mistake. \"I've made plenty of mistakes . If a professional makes enough-mistakes he's no longer a professional and that's why I remain an amateur. I don't want to become a professional.\" Parties of Yancy's type are in rare supply this semester . \"Nobody's doing anything. I wish I could get work now. See any good parties around campus? Nothing.\" He feels that it is the \u00b7result of a combination of apathy, the weather and the fact that it is the second semester. \"Second semesters are always tough. There is a lack of newness, we're in a second half. There are no new face at a party.\" The acquisition of the liquor -license doesn't impress Yancy. \"They've been fighting for this license for a long time and I think it's going to backfire on them.\" IQ the\u00b7 past, hard liquor could be served in MacPhie / Dewick as long as there was no charge for it. The wine and beer liquor license now precludes the consumption of other alcoholic beverages on the premises . Yancy feels tha( \"people are just going to get oversaturated with beer and wine.\" He thinks that a limitation to beer and wine drives people off campus and may even be a reason for the present poor social scene. The social scene may get some new life later on this month. Yancy plans to hold one party at the end of March or the beginning of April and thinks he may have it in the Hyatt Regency Hotel. After that he plans a farewell-to-Tufts bash sometime later in April. To those who think that Yancy's graduation will mean the end, \u00b7'they're wrong. Two sophomores are working with me now and they may even surpass my achievements .\" \u00b7 Friday, February 25, 1977 r--- observations Fear seen as major obstacle to gay rights By STEVE CANTRELL I feel a compelling urge to shed a little light on a matter that over the past few years has become to me most involving. I also know that it would interest many of you. An interest, I would hope, that arrives out of general intellectual curiosity , not prurient. It concerns that dread word: homosexuality . That word which seems to conjure up the most incredible fantasies , stereotypes and prejudices in many people. There is no need to ef plicate them here. Compare your ideas and feelings toward the word homosexuality with your best friend. (It ha~ to be \u00b7with your best friend, for who would ever talk seriously on_such a subject with anyone else?) In this con\u00ad versation are you able to distinguish between what is fact and fantasy? With the increased awareness of homosexualit y generated by the media, I would hope that some fact was uncovered out of your knowledge on the subject. For example, the Episcopal church has just ordained a women, and no less, an avowed lesbian. That is news. Because of the sen\u00ad sationalism such an occurence engenders, we hear about it. The media report on such events not out of a genuine concern for increasing awareness or acceptance of gays. We should not delude ourselves into thinking that such journalism proves how enlightened are the times we live in (for they are not). Rather we need to be aware that the press is solely out fu sell the mosr copies. However , in a backhand fashion, such reporting does increase awareness of the homosexual. Despite the sensationalism which degrades the issue to rank no more\u00b7 important than a new circus in town, press coverage nonetheless demands we con\u00ad front the fact of the homosexual representation in prominent positions in our society. We should applaud those high-minded individuals in positions of notoriety who make public their sexuality _. Such a path is a decidedly risky one, and in the argot of our government to dictate our sexual behavior behind closed doors? Through legislation, those in power seek to controJ the most intimate part of our lives. The heterosexual also, is theoretically subject to this legislation . Yet it is the gay alone who suffers in respect to enforcement. Why bother to legislate against something that has neither proven to be detrimental to our health nor even sub\u00ad versive to the glory of our nation? Such\u00ad authoritarian intervention evokes memories of 1984. The homosexual adult, just like everyone else, does not need a One must realize that homosexuality occurs in both the likeliest and unlikeliest of situations. the homosexual is called \"coming out.\" This means admitting ultimately to the world a sexual preference for one's own sex. The actions of those who do come out and therefore champion the cause of gay rights need to be supported . And all should lend their support to aid the cause of America's most invisible minority. - However , aiding the cause does not imply that one must openly advocate all their demands. Rather, it is reasonable to consider their request fo equitable treatment by society and to open one's mind. Bring it out of the closet, or in more \u00b7trendy jargon, raise your consciousness . You may wonder as.to the necessity of ~nd the reason for your concern, time and effort in pondering the plight of gays. If you imagine yourself at all enlightened , then it follows naturally that you will be against the oppression of individuals . Through increased awareness, the existence of oppression can be realized and dealt with effectively, as we have rec_ently begun to do so for the blacks. Can you logically explain offi<;ially sanctioned discrimination against gay people? And. yet recent documents have confirmed the unjustified harassment of gay men and lesbians. Concentrate for a moment on the issue of individual rights. What power is vested in whole legislative , judicial system designed to suppress what are for ~im / her the natual extension of feelings and desires. Now, if in your conversation with your friend, you discover your feelings toward homosexuality to be strongly negative, bordering perhaps on disgust (sad but true; many despise homosexuals ), then ask yourself why. Suspend your gut reaction, any prurient curiosities of \"what do they do?\" and thoughts of unlawful and \"unnatural\" acts. This may be difficult to do, but reali-ze that gay people differ from you in only one important respect-the rejection of society's approved choice of sexual behavior . Break out of the Ken:and\u00ad Barbie-doll mentality that society still maintains , and think about the experience that binds you with homosexuals . It is the common ground of love. Such an eternal thing, yet how trite its meaning has become. Perhaps we should regard love as something that builds up over time bet\u00ad ween (hopefully only) two people. It serves as the basis of a relation, regardless of the recipient's gender. When we were younger, it may have been expressed towards a best friend. As we mature physically , our concept of love takes on different ramifications, sex being only one part of many. In any case the love between J two people flourishes because of the emotional needs that one feels. It is obvious that one would not take on as a lover a person who might prove now or in the future to be incompatible with one's desires. Rather, a person-either straight or gay-will prefer the company of someone who will satisfy SOIIP(t emotional need, be it a conscious one or not, someone who can make one feel secure in him-<>r herself. This desire to feel secure is common to all. And how simple it all seems. It is only -when society rears its ugly head that we assign the highly subjective value judgements t!)at restrict and prejudice the necessary understanding not only for today's generation but for those to follow. For if the straight person is allowed by society to feel secure in his/ her \"normal\" relationship it is nothing-short of absurd oppression that the gay has to hide his her relationship for fear of reprisals . The list is long: graduate schools, banks future employers, landlords and some so\u00ad called friends react less than positively when confronted with gay people. It is ridiculous that this country which has benefited so many oppressed minorities should create second class citizens out of an estimated 15-20 million Americans . (It is particularly disturbing when those who Friday, March -4, 1977 = Observer have fled other countries because of op\u00ad pression should feel comfortable in becoming the oppressors . If anything, they should feel a certain empathy . Yet; in an increadingly homogenized society the necessity to feel superior to someone else may take precedence over equitable treatment for all.) 'rhe threat most straights feel from gays is the fear of the unknown . Or perhaps more cyncically put, those who fear gays are those who are the most insecure about their own sexuality . That pitiable mass of frightened people, if they could only see past the obscuring curtain of homophobia they have drawn around them, would realize that in an environment free of oppression and the threat of reprisals , they could explore their own sexuality and be quite satisfied in the route they choose. It is this fear that creates a perfect breeding ground for oppression . And ironically , this restricted environment often traps those who never expected to enter the territo-ry at all. Being straight or gay is an attitude as much as it is an action and a belief in one's self that extends beyond the bedroom. The subject is especially traumatic for parents of gay people. Most parents do not perceive , perhaps justifiably , the possibility of gay offspring . While parents may wish to have heterosexually-0riented children, it is perhaps wise to consider that other possibilities may occur, and an altering (if necessary ) of one's sentiments prior to this potential situation's occuring is necessary . If at some later date your children confront you with their homosexuality , you are limited to two choices-either accept or reject the child. The ramifications of rejecting your own progeny (and it happens all the time) include a failure to effectively serve as a parent. To avoid such a potential trauma, the only recourse is to realize that homosexuality occurs in both the likeliest and unlikeliest of situations. To live in fear of homosexuality is analogous to the fear that the Blob will devour Hoboken. No one is going to consume one another. Such unfounded fears only create hard times and too many misunderstandings for all concerned . Think, too, how your-own perceptions of sexuality in all its forms will develop through an increased sensitivity to gay people. This sensitivity marks a refusal to live in an intellectual Dark Age. Hitler's purge of homosexuals resulted from a combination of prejudice , fear and inaction; I fear a more subtle, though equally reprehensible, reaction if further progress -is not made. Steve Cantrell, A'79, is a Fine Arts major. and a member of the Tufts Gay Community. Page Thirteen Easing the tension Since its inception in 1969, the African American Cultural Center has been committed to developing quality programs that reflect and interpret the diversity and richness of the black experience at Tufts. During the past seven years, this commitment has been expressed in a variety of ways in\u00ad cluding lectures, panel discussions, symposia, films and consultation services. As its new director Patricia Hill pointed out this week, that the center has traditionally focused most of its attention on Tufts black community. But with the installment of a new administrative staff this September, the center has undergone a change in direction . The center, she said, has moved toward being more ac\u00ad cessibly to the entire Tufts community. While maintaining its identity as \"a center for helping black students to understand their responsibilities to themselves, to their families, and to their nation\" the center has begun to reach out to other groups on the Tufts campus. During the current academic year, for example, the center has co-sponsored a dance workshop with the physical education and dance department, lectures with the lecture series,_ and a concert with the Tufts chorale. These efforts to reach out to other campus groups by co\u00ad sponsoring events has been extremely beneficial to the entire Tufts community in many ways. First, these programs have increased the community 's awareness of the African American Cultural Center on this campus. Second, they have involved people in Afro\u00b7events who have traditionally shied away from such programs. Third, they have broadened the scopEt of programs available to Tufts students .

Nonetheless, the NDSL program remains the only reliable source of loan dollars for thousands of students who are unable to secure loans under the GFISL program according to the National Financial Aid Ad\u00ad ministrators Association . Three reasons have been offered for the administration 's ommission of the loan program . First, the government reports that of the more than $13 billion loaned to students since the program began in 1958, nearly $7 4 7 million remains outstanding . Second, federal authorities have been saying for years that students should not have to mortgage their futures and finally, it is said that the universities can depend on repayments from loans of previous years. In response to the first point, state and private college and university students maintain a good record of repayment while students who borrow to attend proprietary, vocational , and technical schools represent the largest group of loan defaulters . Secondly, if students in need cannot borrow money and if they cannot obtain a grant, they will ~ot be able to attend college at all, let alone mortgage their future. Finally, repayments account for only 30 percent of this year's $900,000 Tufts paid out as part of the NDSL program . One of Carter's campaign pledges was at least to maintain such programs as NDSL and it was expected that the funding would be increased, not cut off. . Although 90 per cent of last year's appropriation has thus far been restored to the amount available for the 1977-78 school year, -we must ensure that the entire amount is reinstated and, even better, that the NDSL appropriation is increased. Three hundred and thirty five thousand students nationwide depend on the NDSL program including 675 Tufts students (20 per cent of the undergraduates). There are few cases when letters to your congressman can be expected to be effective. In this case however, students must join administrators in the lobbying effort. Page Fourteen Letters to the editor OT's stranded in combat zone To the editor: We would like to make you all aware of an incident that occurred on Monday night, Feb. 28 a.m., involving 40 B.S.O.T. students.' Upon commencement of the last evening class at 8:30 p.m., we were informed by the security police that the O.T. bus would not be coming to return us to the Medford campus. We were told that the \"old\" bus had broken down, and arrangements had not been made for alternate services. We were to find our own transportation-that being the MBT A-which would require us to walk four blocks through the Combat Zone (not the safest part of town.> Efforts were made to contact John Ward, head of Office Services, the depart\u00ad ment responsible for O.T. transportafion . He was unavailable for assistance. Phone calls were then made to Dean of Students Tim Winant and Dean of Special Studies Richard Kelley-neither of whom could be contacted . Now being 8:45 p.m. our third attempt was to call Assistant Dean of Students Bruce Reitman . Finally, having contacted someone, the alternatives suggested were to \"walk in groups to public transportation,\" or ''take a cab and split the fare,\" {approximately $8. back to the Medford campus.) We would like some answe~s to a few simple questions ; 1) Why were we informed 2 hours after the breakdown of the bus that we would not be tran-. sported home? 2) During vacation a second OT bus was purchased for emergencies - Why wasn't it available for us Monday night? 3) On a few occasions an alternative bus service, not affiliated with Tufts, has transported us in daylight hours. Why aren't these services available during the evening hours when public transportation is potentially dangerous . 4 > Would Tufts have taken the responsibility if a. B.S.0.T. student had been robbed or - raped? These problems are not unrealistic, nor un\u00ad common. Efforts have been made in the past to solve similar incidents. As you can see, our situation remains unchanged : Our final question to you all is -To whom do we turn at times such as these? This letter was signed by con\u00ad cerned B.S.O.T. students.

Gilchrist A '77 Evaluations on\u00b7 last legs To the editor: This Sunday night, the Tufts Course Evaluation Committee ,will appeal to the senate where it will be determined if a book will be published or if the Tufts Course Evaluation book will cease to exist. The problem is money. When money was delegated out last year, only enough was fire. But do not despair for we still have Sam, the nod-out wonder dog. Sam is a medium sized, copper colored, lovable God-knows-what-type dog. Sam can be caught sleeping around campus any spring day. Sprawled\u00b7 out on the sidewalk like a comatose, liver ravaged fratty (mouth\u00ad breather genus). Sam knows how to do things with a minimum of effort and a maximum of comfort. If he spots a scurrying squirrel, he will not' sprint after it willy\u00ad nilly like a rookie. He's no dummy! He barks at another dog and points it out saying, \"Hey Ralphie ! Quick, there goes a squirrel with 11 case of beer!\" During rainstorms, Sam impersonates a long haired druggy and sneaks into classrooms .

Ironically enough, the course evaluation book was the brainchild of the senate, created in 19Jl, and run by the Senate until it became a separate entity of its own in 1973 where the senate's only role is financing the major part of the book. The Senate's argument is that the needed money will temporarily create a $300 deficit in their budget. However, a guaranteed $1500 return will put the Senate in the black by the end of its fiscal year, this June. Should the course evaluation book be allowed to die when it has already proven its worth? It is a student's only guide in. choosing courses, whether the data is totally < Continued on page 17) Staff Corner So ends the War By KIRK WEINERT 1968 -The college campuses around the nation are vibrant with student political activism. The Tufts Weekly, fore\u00ad runner of the Observer, creates a policy whereby it will no longer accept any advertisements dealing with military recruitment. The U.S. is deeply committed to its sordid foreign interventionist' policies. \u00b7 1977 \u00b7 The Tufts Political Action Group can only draw 40 people to a lecture by Native American activist Russell Means. The Tufts Observer, successor to the Weekly, votes against a policy whereby it would no longer accept ad\u00ad vertisements dealing with military recruitment or coming from corporations with connections to the military or arms construction. The U.S. is still deeply committed to its foreign interventionist policies. The staff's reasons for revoking the existing ban on military ads this week are as diverse as the political beliefs of those who voted to accept the ads. As well as we can determine from the highly emotional debate that rocked the Observer office walls Tuesday night, four points were used to justify the acceptance of military ads: 1) there exists an absolute \"right of free access to the media\" by anyone who could afford to pay for it; 2) there is \"no war in Vietnam anymore\"; 3) holding an ad \"doesn't hurt those we would want to hurt\") 4) moral reprehensibility is too subjective a criteria for rejecting advertisements. Many staffers argue that the Observer is pursuing a policy of \"discrimination,\" a word that evokes the most painful guilt feelings in those \"liberals\" who are acknowledged to preponderate on the Observer staff, in denying any cor\u00ad poration the \"right\" to advertise in the Observer. However, by charging for advertiseme~i~, a newspaper, in effect, is discriminating on the basis of wealth. Only those companies who are able to afford to blanket the nation with advertisements catch the eyes of the potential job applicant or consumer. There is a place for equal access to information on recruit\u00ad ment for all companies; the Observe!\" regularly prints the schedule provided by the Career Guidance and Placement Office in the notices section. By doing so, the rights of any student to a complete list of his/her opportunities is provided, without prejudicing his/her selection. One must also recognize, though, that the Observer is operating within a capitalist society and needs $12,000 in advertising this year in order to be printed every week. However the Observers financial condition is not such that' all types of advertising need be unreservedly accepted. The message of cigarette ads ( i.e. one should smoke) have heen held to be offensive by the staff. Those ads have been held on those grounds. Can one contend unhypocritally that the actions of the U.S. military and corporations supplying arms to repressive regimes arourid the world are inoffensive? One might defend U.S. foreign policy by noting that there is no more draft and that our nation is no longer at war. Yet the prosecution of our national defense can be split into two categories: prevention and action. To \"prevent\" wars, the U.S. spends over $120 billion on defense-related budgets. Enough money has been spent on navy submarines alone thJJt the existing 41 subs have the nuclear capacity to destroy\u00b7 any nation on earth at least 35 times. One might note that those billions of dollars provide needed employment in the United States. Yet, according to statistics furnished by the Coalitibn for a New Foreign _and Military Policy, a cut of $13.6 billion from the defense budget that was given to human needs budgets would eliminate 316,550 defense\u00ad related jobs, but provide 1,441,000 civilian jobs, a 1.5 percent drop in unemployment . To \"prevent\" further wars, the U.S. government attempts to maintain a status quo by propping up \"friendly\" regimes with a massive influx of arms to suppress \"enemies\" of those states. Those being tortured in the jails of the South Korean, Iranian, Chilean, Nicaraguan, Philipino, and Indonesian governments are not the enemies of the American people; they are fighting for the same human rights President Carter has defended in the past few weeks. , The Observer receives money from the military and those corporations who supply arms to the Shah of Iran and his cohorts. On0s could extend this argument to its logical ex\u00ad treme and note that the money received for the 4\" x 5\" space the Observer sells to those corporations represents the suffering of millions of people whose only crimes were those of being born in nations where governments do not respect basic human rights. What good would the Tufts Observer do when it rejects military ads? Would it have any effect on present policies? By ourselves, we may not be able to affect the military\u00ad industrial complex, but crimes like Vietnam and Watergate were exposed because, in part, the press was willing to care. We would have hoped that the Observer could have con\u00ad tinued to set an example of moral responsibility that could contribute to further exposes of criminalconduct against '1u1m1nity. But it has not. The preceding opinion has been endorsed by Laura Barrett, Danny Herman, Mike Hodges, George Kalogerakis, Tom Rankin, Sheree Rheinhardt, Scott Thurm and Carla Wallace. Page Fifteen \\ ' ) observations Jeans are gay on Wednesday Rending walls By GORDON GOTTLIEB Unjustified assumption of heterosexuality won't be in effect next Wednesday . Mi:rch 9th has' been declared \"Gay Wednesday \" by the Tufts Gay Community. Anyone on campus wearing blue jeans on that day will be con\u00ad sidered homosexual. ' cases out of a hundred, these excuses won't be true, yet they'll be dredged up from the seemingly bottomless resevoir of excuses people manage lo have. B.v JON KOSLOW ______ ,.. An abitrary preferenc e? Absolutefy . Almost as arbitrary as the ways the straight com\u00ad munity has determined what constitutes gay male or lesbian appearance, dress or man\u00ad nerisms. When TGC sponsored the first Gay Wednesday two years ago, many . straight people deliberately refrained from wearing jeans. Why? Why this fear of being gay for a day? It cerainly was not because they When Robert Frost said, \"good fences make good neigh\u00ad bors,\" he was unintentionally invoking what one may call the \"Hobbesian\" model of international relations. Essen\u00ad tially, this views people as a rather greedy, unwieldy lot, whose natural predilection for conflict can only be inhibited by a variety of artificial restraints. No doubt the Roman Chinese and Soviet empires had something of this sort i~ mind when building Hadrian's wall, the \"Great Wall,\" and ;,he Be~lin wall. (The Soviets added the twist of keeping people m rather than out.) Cn the other hand, \"something there is that doesn't love a wall.'' This is the reflection of the Rousseauian image of man: Of the \"general will,\" harmony, the Kantian im\u00ad perative, and the good man's faith in the good intentions of others. It finds its symbolic fruition in the storming of the walls of the Bastille, and recurrs whenever men opt on the side of trust.' Both these dynamics -mending and rending walls\u00b7 are clearly at work in the world today. A unique glimpse into these complex processes can also be discerned from time to time among the students at Fletcher, about a third of whom are foreign students. No one in this highly globe-conscious group has escaped some reflective identity with his home country.Consequently,interpersonal relations often take on an international tinge, though borders are usually easier breached across a dining table than abroad. On one occasion the well-fitted young Saudi, whose moustache and dark, regular features give him something of an Omar Shariff look, engages in banter with two Iranians who occasionally break off in spurts of Persian. He has only just returned from Riyadh, where he has witnessed the intra\u00ad rivalry surrounding the two-tier oil_ price system. The Saudis are winning that face-off. At home he often heard the Cranian broadcast charging the Saudis with being \"Tools of the American . imperialists.\" He smiles across at me, \"We don't bother to reply.'' Another time, earlier in the year, an Israeli student, veteran of the 1973 _Yorn Kippur war, approaches a Kenyan in a crowd with a broad smile and takes his hand. The subject is Entebbe, and all present remember that Kenya offered badly needed refueling facilities to the raiders. There is a round of laughter. Later,, it becomes apparent that the Kenyan disagrees with his governm ent's policy.The subject is not broached again. A pretty Pakistani girl and an Indian civil servant are friend~. Yet they both remember the fighting between their count?es _ not long ~go. She was in Lahore during the bomb~ng. Both lost friends and relatives in the frey. Yet 1f th~re are lingering hostilities they are not apparent, and they discuss the merits of India's controversial Kashmir policy freely. On the other hand, the Israeli and Arab students when they sit together generally avoid the topic of politics. \u00b7For all the visitors, this is an occasion to learn about the U.S.stude nt from Ecuador who is surprised to find that so many in the U.S. speak Spanish. An East African student is moved by the degree of segregation in the dining halls, but finds he often has little to offer to eager, young Americ~ blacks who call him \"brother.\" For Americans , this a chance to learn about themselves, and about the way others view them. The more they press students from India and Korea, for example, on the issue of human rights, the more they realize how dearly their precious values of freedom and democrac y are taken abroad. I remember a conversation I had with three Japanese.At one point, I was told that if the average man on the street in Tokyo were asked to name whether the U.S. or U.S.S.R. were more democratic, he would more likely than not choose the U.S.~ .. R. I was shocked. The disparities of wealth and living conditions are greater herethan in the Soviet Union. After several hours, with an audience that was more sympathetic than if I had been talking to, say, Koreans or Tanzanians, I thought ,J had moved a few stones from the barriers of communication and made the point that that was not all democracy was about. Though I may have won a small victory, the fact was that even the word \"democracy\" was no longer considered indivisible or accepted abroad as an American possession. The purpose of Gay Wednesday is lo help people understand ( and hopefully reject) those arbitrary societal labels and their harmful effects by giving the straight community the opportunity if only for one day and perhaps for the first time -to experience the subtler forms of discrimination and the underlying hostility faced daily by gays (and indeed by other minorities on campus). It's not really that big a deal being gay. But come Wednesday, people will resurrect the most dubious of reasons for not wearing their jeans: it was loo cold; it was loo warm; I forgot; Iwore them yesterday ; they're in the wash; I don't have any. The list goest on ad infinitum . ln 99 considered themselves to be gay, and wished lo hide the fact, but because they feared some sort of social ostracism from their friends if they appeared to be anything but heterosexual. How fragile our friendships and in\u00ad deed our self-concepts must be if they can be so influenced by this spectre of homosexuality . Unjust evaluations (Continued from page 14), there occurs this sentence: \"One person called the professor rigidly academic and scientific.\" This is in fact the only sentence with something like particulars one can give meaning to. It therefore colours the whole report though the words belong to one student alone. As a matter of fact the sentence is totally inaccurate and plain silly. The student's choice of words is careless and probably symp\u00ad tomatic of how\u00b7 little he has learned at Tufts. The course (about English Romantic Poets wa_s carefully . shaped to avoid aca.demic barriers and ap~al something like the student's own ex\u00ad perience. What 'scientifice' is supposed to mean in this context one can only guess. I assume that it signifies the student's resent\u00ad ment against having his stock\u00ad responses questioned ;not in any scientific way, of course, but by the appeal to the informed and disciplined imagination . Another sentence in the same report which is merely fatuous: presumptuous, as when it asserts that a course was \"geared towards the senior and graduate student.\" On what information is that assertion made? As a matter of fact the course is deliberately non-specialist (as the description in the depart\u00ad mental booklet shows,) presupposes no experience of poetry of criticism (one cannot expect them anyway), but sharts with common, shared experience and some assumptions about the contemporary student's sen- sibility. 'i .. wO ... intellectual malpractice in their present form Another instance of inadequate vocabulary and lack of com\u00ad prehension is the statement that the instructor is \"inflexible .\" <The views of how many students is this supposed to sum up?) This offensive word has to be read against every instructor 's dif\u00ad ficulty in striking a productive balance between open discussion and time-wasting chat. The in\u00ad structor's responsibility to the class or seminar has to be con\u00ad stantly pondered and put into practice especially in order to offer genuine information and to correct misunderstanding , prejudice or stock ideas. Students, like all of us, find it painful to modify set ideas, admit \u00b7 emotional poverty, and assimilate new information , especially in such personal ex\u00ad perience as the reading of poetry. Course evaluations. esoeciallv in literature requires knowledge of pedagogical issues and also a developed skill in writing; otherwise they reinforce ignorance and ignoble attitudes. R.F. Storch is an associate proressor in the English Dept c I use this term mockingly , yet the fear of alternative sexual lifestyles is such that society has deliberately covered uo the existence of and contribution by gay people in an effort to protect straight people from the truth. When the media finally begins to deal with reality, and television offers a half dozen shows in one season dealing with lesbians and gay men, it's considered a major breakthrough , and Time deems it the Year of the Gay.) All of my friends -both straight and gay -will be wearing blue jeans this Wednesday . There's no reason why those heterosexuals comfortable with their sexuality shouldn't do similarly. The only people who can't afford to wear blue jeans on March 9th are the several hundred gay students who have chosen not to emerge from their closets, ironically appearing as the more con\u00ad spicuous amidst their blue-legged peers. TGC will hold a discussion about sex roles Wednesday night at 8 PM in Laminan Lounge, East Hall. Gordon Gottlieb, A '77 is a history major and president of Tufts Gay Community . But how does f the Judge feel? /1 By ALAN STEARNS A. trip to the courtroom, like the classroom , can sometimes be _ fabulous theater. Mind games and body language anq blue ~ smoke and mirrors abound. A strange kind of reverse dramatic irony is at work in the courtroom . Unlike traditional dramatic irony where the spectators know something the :1 actors don't, in the courtroom the actors usually know something the spectators don't. One point everyone seems to loose sight of is that all that matters is what the judge thinks. Nevertheless, lots of people carry on in court as. if this were not so.

Likewise it is interesting to see Dean Harleston and Provost McCarthy smile cindnod to each other after a similarly obstruse piece of testimony . But even more interesting is when another statement elicits everyones approbation as if the point just made will clinch case for both -sides. Another example of this phenomenon occured when I asked EEOC attorney Alan Silverstein during recess about the impact of -Dr. Beals' testimony and he said, \"I'm not sure he hurt us.\" This was peculiar because as Tufts at\u00ad torney Robert Glass was examining Beals, he winked at Provost McCarthy who was in the audience .

I would just like to point out that, fo~ the last ten years, Tufts has had an excellent undergraduate program at the University of Tubingen in Germany. No only is \"Tufts\u00ad in-Tubingen\" one of our three major programs (along with -Paris and London) but is also held in uniformly high regard by the faculty, the ad\u00ad ministration, and students who participated in it. Yet, in the rather lengthy article, it was completely ignored. I would certainly be interested to know why this_program is being. denied its fair share of-\u00ad coverage . Ronald Salter Assoc. Prof. of German Editors note: The Observer apologizes for not elaborating on the Tufts Tubingen Program . This was partly due to the fact that it was not being reviewed by the Committee at that time. - High standards in question To the editor: In a recent Observer article (Feb. 11, '77) Dean of Ad\u00ad missions Michael Behnke stated that -Tufts University \"had to make up for deficits in the budget by enrolling a larger class, so over 40 per\u00ad cent of the applications had to be admitted .\" And further, that \"a continued lowering of Tufts' standards was taking place.\" The picture Dean Behnke has painted is rather grim: Tufts can no longer afford to be selective in its admissions standards because of financial difficulties . Yet only one week later, in a Boston Herald American article (Feb. 20), Behnke asserted that Tufts lay in that group of institutions. \"which are secure and want better students\" vs. \"those which are trying to stay alive.\" He listed among the former group such schools as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Amherst and Tufts. In fact, the inference drawn here is that, Tufts is presently capable of con\u00ad tinuing its \"high\" standards for admission and has managed to stay clear of any overriding fi~ancial dif\u00ad ficulties. Doesn't Behnke see his contradiction? His statements to the Herald American are \u00b7especially ironic since they are contained in an article concerned with \"questionable student recruiting \" by some schools and false advertising by others. Perhaps Behnke should examine his own subtle form of advertising which is itself guilty of misleading the public as well as naively reassuring to any prospective applicants.

Wary of this reputation , I included a note with my article of 2 25 77 requesting to be present for editing. To no avail. Two alterations and ten typographical errors later I read my material tran\u00ad sformed into the hoddy jabber characteristic of the paper. Submitted : Energizing Art, Sina Sculptures at the LC.A. The headline which appeared however, was fabricated by the Observer, their word choice mortifying and\u00b7 very inappropriate. Sina's sculptures do not slither. They glimmer, spin, sparkle, shimmer, and flicker. The entire theme of the article emphasized an integration between art and technology . Copy revisions misconstrued this meaning in the final sentence. They summary read before inept editing: \"Delight _ in the Sina show.

Court case---- (Continued from page 16) When Beals mistakenly used the phrase \"northwest on the graph,\" when he meant to say, \"northeast on the graph,\" one begins to wonder if he could not have made similar slips with signs of coefficien \u00b7ts, \"t\" statistics, or , \"f\" test values and so forth. presumably, the difference is that no one would notice the technical slips. .It's amazing how often the examining lawyer (or cross examining lawyer for that matter) will say, \"Now on table 5A you found that . . . \" and the expert witness, wil quickly correct him saying, \"No, you mean table so and so.\" Ordinary language philosophy also came to mind when Beals defended his usage of a specific term by saying that if was ap\u00ad propriate if you \"apply the test in WIT event #1 :\u00b7 f the ordinary sense.\" At one point the Tufts attorney objected to a question on the grounds that he didn't un\u00ad derstand it and Judge Murray allowed it to stand saying,that it was an acceptable question if the witness understood it. When one realizes that the lawyers exammmg the statisticians are in roughly the same boat as the reporters covering the statisticians, and you remember that all that really matters is what the judge thinks; the question becomes, what does the Judge make of all of this?

In August 1973, one day of court . hearings were held regarding possible temporary restraining orders for Joost and White but both were denied in that request. Despositions were given in October 1973 by former President Burton C.

In Feburary 1974, the National Organization for Women (NOW) got involved and protested the use of tuition funds paid in part by women, to finance sex discrimination litigation used to fight Professors Joost and White.

Ironically enough, in Feb. 1971, prior to the passage of Ttle VII which outlawed sex discrimination and prior to a series of sex discrimination charges made aginst Tufts, the university came out with an Affirmative Action Program which stated in part that Tufts would, \"conduct a review of wages to identify possible un\u00ad justified differences in wages.\" A press release said, \"Where the reason for the difference in wages is found to be inadequate, thedifference will be corrected .\" EEOC After their own investigation, the EEOC, a federal government commission created to prevent any unlawful employment practices, filed suit on behlaf of Professors Joost and White mak4!g Tufts the first University the commiss ion ever filed suit against.

The class action suit filed by the EEOC attempted to show that Tufts discriminates with resoect to salaries from men and women across the board. (Attorney for Barbara White, Nancy Gertner said this week that is legally possible but unlikely for the EEOC to win its case and for Joost and White to loose.)

Page Eighteen ( Continued from page 1) In his testimony of over a year . ago, Harleston asserted that Galantic resigned, \"of his own free will,\" and that he was \"not pressured into resigning.\" Harleston answered several questions on the tenure process in general at this week's proceedings . He commented that when he came to the Dean's of Faculty's office in 1970, \"There were no systematic guidelines for soliciting student opinion,\" on professors. Now, he said, it is \"more systematic but never frozen or systematized .\" He mentioned \u00b7 that within the rank of full professor, in addition to there being a \"gr~;it range in salaries, \"there is alsQ ~ \"wi~~ range of scholarship\" from \"people with no demonstrable scholarship,\" to people with international reputations. due process.\" He added that Galantic did not have a reputation for sexism at that time. '-\"~ivn,,, Harleston did not participate in or contribute to the sub\u00ad committee's deliberations on White's bid for tenure. He stressed that he had great faith it would move in an orderly manner no matter what biases any in\u00ad dividuals had. Furthermore, the \"autonomous nature\" of the tenure committee would not have allowed him to have Galantic replaced, Harleston said. !s for the allegation that Ivan Galantic lectured that women were \"irrational and emotional,\" Harleston testified that he ac\u00ad cepted Galantic's explanation that he was lecturing on the views of the artist who created the painting and attributing the _iudgments to him. (Exodus from the Garden of Eden). Harleston recalled a meeting with Professor Joost in which some of her 11previous charges against Professor: Galantic were. watered down. The charge that J Galantic hid in a closet while listening to a lecture was e changed by Joost to a claim that J someone thought he was hiding, , said Harleston. Another charge that he was eavesdropping on phone calls was also changed to a charge that someone else said that he was eavesdropping, said Harleston . A former Fine Arts Depart-. ment secretary, Mrs. Marotta. testified that under the directions of Professor Galantic she mailed out evaluation forms to '72 students who had taken courses with Professor White in 1970-71.

March 4, 1977 Rich Lewis coaches Tufts debate program By MARCY JAG UST Rich Lewis likes being dif\u00ad ferent. During the day he teaches nursery school and every Tuesday night he coaches Tufts' debate team. \"Rich Lewis is tremendously brilliant.

His insight comes from many years of ex\u00ad perience. Rich Lewis dresses as casually as an undergraduate. At a recent meeting of the team he showed up wearing jeans and a plaid flannel shirt with shirttails hanging. fie sports a dark beard and mustache and hair nearing his shoulders . Lewis' interest in debate reaches back to his years at Boston College High School where, after trying many ac\u00ad tivities, he found debaters to be \"my kind of people\" with his debate team, he traveled, met interesting people and went to two national tournaments. As juniors, he and his partner captured the national high school debate -championship and as seniors, they were the first runners-up . During a debate team meeting, Rich Lewis paces back-and forth across the front of the room. His voice is loud and clear, his hands move continuously, and every word counts.

Later, he returned to school to give debate another try but soon dropped out because \"my heart wasn't in it.\" He coaclied at Oberlin for a year and then went to live in Maine. Three years later, he was called back to the area by Bob Baker, an old friend at Boston College High School and coach of Tufts' debate team. Last year he and Bob Baker coached the team together. This year, Lewis has sole hold of the reins. Next year Nan Bernstein , an alumna of Tufts' debate program , will return to assist him. Lewis, now in his second year as coach, had the problem of starting over again. At the start there were less than four people in the team's core and more people were \u00b7 needed to do the work. Now, six people constitute the active debate team and Lewis expects that most of them will be back next year. One of the major problems the debate team has faced in \u00b7 the past is a lack of commitment. Many people would participate for one-semester and then discontinue their par\u00ad ticipation in the face of in\u00ad creasing academic pressures or they would commit themselves to other activities . Debate, ac\u00ad cording to Lewis, is a big time sport that requires constant work and attention. Robert DeScherer Rich Lewis, Harvard grad and nursery school teacher, heads the debate program. The large system of organized debate in the country remains invisible to many of the unin\u00ad volved. Over 700 major rnllee:es currently have debate teams and thousands of dollars are spent on large debate tournaments each year. Rich Lewis categorized debate programs according to their basic levels. The first level consists of schools with superior talent and large financial com\u00ad mitments to their programs . Tufts geographical district, there are but a handful of \"big time\" schools which include Harvard and Dartmouth. But, as Rich , states, college size is irrelevant. The size and success of the program depends mainly upon the emphasis the school places upon it. Some schools award debate scholarships . Such schools usually have between eight and 12 people on a team. Between two and six of the SOCIAL WORK IN ISRAEL Israel Kas long been a model of successful integration .

Schools on the second level do not put as great an emphasis on debate and do not sub\u00ad stantially support it. While some may be large and have talent, they are not as successful. The third level of debate includes schools t,hat appropriate little money and lack campus support. Rich feels that \"Tufts is an anomaly,\" the money is given, but little attention is paid to the program . The debate program's most pressing problem is the need for adequate office space and facilities. Presently , the debate office occupies approximately forty square feet of space in Miner Hall. All work must be done in a separate room. (Continued on page 22) Intercollegiate Men's Tennis Organizational Meeting .Monday, March 7 at 7 p.m. in Room 1, Cousens Gym.

Page Nineteen sports Jumbos ditch arch\u00ad rivals in gruelling overtime dogfight By BRIAN NORDER and PAUL DERVIS When a team beats an arch\u00ad rival, it's good. When it avenges a loss in the process, it's better. When it's done in exciting fashion to boot-well-who could ask for more? Take the Tufts and Brandeis basketball teams. Arch-rivals , right? Brandeis beat Tufts earlier this year ,right ?Overtime games are always exciting, right ?There is the-story of the 100-91 Jumbo victory Monday night at Cousens gym. Tufts came out of the in\u00ad termission with the intent of keeping the pressure on, and they succeeded . Due greatly to the tough play, both on offense and defense, of Jim Campbell and Lino Reid, the Jumbos managed to tie it up at 55. With the Judges bringing the ball up court in an attempt to recapture the advantage , lightening-quick Daryl Brown stole the ball and dumped it to Reid for the easy score. But Tufts held on to the slim lead. Tufts fans surely must wish that Monday's game had been the season finale as the Jumbos closed the campaign Wednesday with a disappointment 101-90 loss to Boston State to finish with a 10- 14 mark. Martin, the 6'4\" menacing junior, took command . Brandeis started pulling away and the time - was running short. With only 1:40 left in the contest, Brandeis had an 84-76 lead and it appeared that all that was left was to turn off the lights and lock up the doors. B iffy Bournazos Freshman Jim Campbell, shown here in action against Hamilton, was a major factor in thet Jumbos' last-minute surge against Union. Stamina was probably the key for the Jumbos against Brandeis as they had just come off a busy weekend of ball, defeating Union College Saturday night 74-70 after dropping to Hamilton the previous night 83-77. This was the second overtime victory of_ the year for the Jumbos in as many times. They upset division II powerhouse Bentley 83-82 on February 2. The sweetness of the Brandeis victory is unquestionable . The ~udges are the only legitimate basketball rival Tufts has. But the game did not start well for the home team as Brandeis' two stellar forwards, Joe Carter and John Martin, had hot hands while the Jumbos were plagued by poor shooting and numerous travelling violations . Before long, the visitors amassed a 10 point lead with 30 seconds left at the half. However, two quick buckets brought Tufts back to within six, at halftime, 49-43. But every season must have its unpredictable hero, and for Tufts he was to surface in this game. With the slimmest of time left, in came the seldom used Michael Tapscott. Tapscott, the younger brother of the man who held the school's assist record, is a senior who joined the squad well after the season was underway and since has only played in a hand\u00ad ful of games and never in such an important situation. The Tapscott gamble worked out. After the game, Coach John White explained his reasoning for inserting the guard. \"Sometimes players go into the game, tense up, and aren't able to fit into the flow of the game when they're not involved. Michael is our biggest fan and is always ready to play. I felt that at that time his quickness could help.\" White couldn't have been more correct. In the short time he played, Tapscott scored three points, made a key steal and picked up an assist. After Tapscott came in a\u00ad basket by Brown, a free throw by Mark Craigwell and a fifteen foot jumper by Tapscott himself pulled the Jumbos to within three. Freshman Ron Woods who had 23 points on the night grabbed a rebound on an errant shot and hit for two on the en\u00ad suing lay-up. With 22 seconds left, Jim Campbell fouled out and Brandeis guard Bob Birrell went to the line with a chance to put the game away .But he only made one of the two shots and Tufts came up with the rebound. Harold Sparrow missed a jump shot at the other end of the court but once again WQods made a lay\u00ad up on the rebound to tie it up and send the game into overtime. Sparrow put the Jumbos up by two a minute into the overtime period and it was downhill for the visitors from there. Tufts ragged the ball to kill the clock for a minute, -giving Brown a Hockey ends with three losses By KEVIN SLATKAVITZ Two losses to Suffolk and one to Bentley this week ended the Jumbo hockey season with a 4-14- 2 record. The Bentley game was almost a carbon copy of the teams' meeting a week earlier, when Bentley prevailed , 13-1. But Tufts was hardly just going through the motions. Although Bentley skated of at the end of the first period with a 4-0 lead, the first eleven and a half minutes of the game were played to a close checking zero-all tie. Bentley took a 5-0 lead at 6: 20 of lhe second period on a power play goal. Al Butzer took a pass from Oram to put Tufts on the scoreboard at 10: 15 before Bentley would again go ahead by five. When Steve O'Brien was in\u00ad jured and Oram left in the second period with a game misconduct , the outcome of the game looked obvious. Tom Harvey aided his linemate Dave Kelley in scoring a powerplay goal at 12:45 and make the dfference 11-2 Bentley. Later in the period Butzer added his second goal of the night to round out the scoring. In their finai two games of the season, Tufts faced off against Suffolk and came away from both on the short end of 6-3 decisions. Last Saurday, Tufts traveled to the Boston College Arena to battle with Suffolk. And for the first two periods that is exactly what the two learns did. Al Butzer scored at 5: 46 of the first period when he was set up by team\u00ad mates Russ O'Brien and Paul Sorgi. The lead held up until 12:37, when Devin of Suffolk beat goalie Mike Williams for the score. After Suffolk took a 2-1 lead at 3: 36, Butzer scored his 2oth goal of the season on a power play at 9:37.

A late power play goal gave Suffolk a 6-3 victory, but the story of the game was Tufts being out-shot in the third period 11-6. PARTING SHOTS: It was a disappointing season for the icemen, who did not come close to repeating last year's 14-2 per\u00ad formance There isn't one thing that can be pinpointed as as the gist of this season's troubles. Injuries did play a key role, however. Senior defenseman Paul Sorgi played most of the -season with a badly strained ankle; Tony Norris was slowed up by a bad knee before he was lost for the remainder of the year with a broken toe, and Rich Bell had to call it quits when he broke his wrist... Al Butzer was the te_am's leading scorer for the last two seasons. He amassed 36 goals and 69 points in that stretch. This year Butzer scored 20 gals and 15 assists for 35 points. He was followed by Steve O'Brien (13-15- 28),Russ O'Brien (8-17-25), Jim Mulroy (8-6-14), and Tom Harvey (3-7-10).

He hit two free throws a few seconds later and suddenly Tufts was up by six, and it was virtually over. Brown finished the night with 27 points including eight in the overtime period for the 100-91 victory. Brown has \u00b7also been the key with 26 points in Saturday's home win over Union. It was not one of\u00b7 the better efforts by the Jumbos this season. The teams were close throughout the first half until the Jumbos built up a nine point lead in the last few minutes of the half, which ended 41-32. But true to form, the Jumbos allowed Union to make a contest of it in the second half. The visitors grabbed the lead 59-57 mid-way through the period but free throws by Reid ti~~J!}~jpme at 61 and again at 66.

His face is :> .accentuated by a wiry, flowing ! beard, the same shade of light 1c; brown as his eyes. His voice is o :soft, and he speaks in a steady, ,, \u00b7even tone which shows his belief in what he says. This is Matt rl Fogarty, a junior at Tufts from 1 !Duxbury, Mass. studying ,n.;engineering , and, unknown to l those around him, one of the top\u00ad r ranked badminton players in the United States. At this point, the ignorant reader scoffs and queries a riend, \"This guy plays bad\u00ad inton ... what's he doin' on the ports page?\" But the type of adminton in which Fogarty xcels is not the back-yard xercise of an autumn vening;rather it is the tour\u00ad ament type, with spectators, eedings, five foot nets, and goose eather birds which can rocket at ne hundred miles per hour via n overhand smash. \"Just like a football player or an auto racer will say their port's the best, I'll say mine's e best.

He's travelled to Montreal , \u00b7 Toronto, and California, batting birds past startled opponents all the way. He has an older brother and sister, both ranked players, and when his regular doubles partner can't make it, his father fills in. His mother is his regular mixed doubles partner. What do sophomore forward Mark Craigwell, freshman center Ronnie Woods and assistant basketball coach R.C. Pruitt have in \u00b7common other than the Jumbo team? They were all involved ionship ba~ketball team Woods the team whilePruitt was the coach . . . And speaking of Pruitt, how many people know that in addition to being the assistant here, he is presently going for his bachelors degree at Boston State College. He will only have a couple of credits remaining after this semester. I wonder if he had mixed loyalties in our game with Boston State last Wednesday . . Co:eaptians of the soccer March 4, 1977 team last year, Steve Byer and Steve Kadish, as well as ace scorer Billy Schacter are anticipating the upcoming United States Maccabbean tryouts in Hartford, Con\u00ad necticut. If they make the team, they will be par\u00ad ticipating in the summer of 1977's competition in Israel ... And speaking of Schacter _(we are speaking of alot of people today), he and Tom Russo were recently elected as co-<:aptains of the lacrosse team. Last year Russo was the team's fourth leading scorer, while Schacter was ranked second in the nation among Division 11 and 111 goalies ... Have productive training camps in Florida, baseball, lacrosse and golf teams, on spring break . With such a background it is obvious that Matt Fogarty is no second. rate player, but a bona\u00ad fide badminton champion . It becomes even more obvious when he talks about the game itself. His voice takes on a special quality, displaying the ex\u00ad citement which the sport contains for him, and for anyone else. \"Quickness is the key to bad\u00ad minton. Ypu have to be prepared all the time, on your toes, never your heels, ready to dive for a drop shot, chase a quick cross, or track down a clear. Singles and doubles are a lot different. Singles can be a waiting game, patience, setting up a point, while doubles is the quick kill, because you know your partner is there to back you up.\" Observer \"The English are real good at deception, looking one way, or maybe a racquet fake, just to get you started the wrong way. Once you've started, it's hard to change directions . The reaction time is so small, and your op\u00ad ponent is always hitting it where you're not going to be.\" That is the major strategy of the game, hitting the bird where your opponent isn't, and strategy plays a key role. \"The smash is not that ef\u00ad fective of a shot. In singles, a straight smash just sets you up for a clear return behind you. The way to use a smash is by drop\u00ad ping a shot in short, then a deep clear to one side, and then a smash to the far corner.\" Is placement \u00b7 the major strategy? \"Placement and speed. That's why conditioning is so important . Training consists of aerobic and anaerobic exercises, geared at improving reflexes and quickness , as well as stamina. The Europeans and Asians do ballet and yoga. I don't have time for all that, so three and five hundred meter sprints, along with skipping and other exer\u00ad cises, make up the major part of my training.\" Along with playing lots of badminton . For the last five weekends , Fogarty has travelled about, competing in tournaments from Michigan to Maine, and the schedule gets worse before it gets better. Still, spending his time on a 44' x 22' court isn't so bad. \"There's a real social aspect to the sport. You meet a lot of people, you travel. All the game needs is exposure . It's a great sport, with the speed and the strategy. I know people would like it, if they got the chance to see it.\" For some, that chance may come soon. With the sponsorship of some major corporations , a tour has been scheduled for next year, the first step in a process that could lead to a professional badminton league. But Fogarty thinks that's still far away. \"The tournaments now are very restrictive. Players have to wear white, and court etiquette is ver.y important. The players are going to have to organize and ignore the IBF before anything will happen.\" Later this month, Matt will travel to San Diego for the U.S. Senior Nationals , where he is seeded in two events, the doubles and mixed doubles, with his Dad and Mom as partners. His failure to gain a seed in the singles,. division is no indication of any preference on Matt's part, however. \"I've had more success in the doubles, because I played a lot of doubles at the Universit\u00a5 Club in Boston as a kid. But to me, singles is more rewarding , because you are by yourself.\" Fogarty was highly rewarded recently, when he defeated the nation's sixth ranked singles player in a marathon match. For one who is unseeded in singles, he , is highly dangerous , and for one who competes in a sport where the rewards can't be stored in a bank, his great skill and love of the game determine his title as a great athlete more than any salary ever could.

Lewis would like to see the university match their monetary support with space. Specifically , he desires a room set aside for debate activity like the one at Harvard. The Harvard room, used solely by the debate team, is a place where members can go to relax and work on the debate material when they feel like it. Without space, Lewis warns, the debate program \"will never rise above a certain level.\" Lewis sincerely believes that there is a need for some Tufts students to realize there is available time to participate in extracurricular activities and still be successful in academics . Many people choose to devote all their time to their studies and are afraid to allow time for anything extra. He feels that Tufts students put more time into their work compared to students at other schools. Debate is not unpopular , just impossible given the time many students leave free, he feels. He would like to see people want to give 12 hours a week to debating. Lewis has decided that com\u00ad peting for \"life, limb, and money\" is not for him. He is bothered by people \"who are worried to death over what they are going to do at thirty.\" Lewis himself doesn't give it much thought. His plans are made merely one year in advance. Lewis has noticed that Tufts' athletic teams do not suffer from lack of membership as has been a problem with the debate team in the past. He has also noticed that many students intereste d in communications and media are attracted to both the news paper and the debate team and feel they must choose between them. According to Lewis, people say they want to have tiJile for themselves and be happy. He feels that debate improves one's ability to speak in public, a valuable skill for later jobs. The team experience is also valuable, Lewis says. .. Many top high school debaters pass Tufts by when they look at colleges because they simply do not know the Tufts program exists. Lewis would like to see a debate tournament organized with the participation of 30 high schools. Students interested in college debate would get a chance to see the campus and talk to \u00b7present team members . Lewis believes that more effort should be put into bringing the good debater to Tufts.

While Lewis does not mean to discourage new debaters, he believes the team should be more balanced . Lewis would also like a formal system to tell the team which entering students are interested in debate-possibly a question on the application . Many schools have public debate exhibitions on campus once or twice a year and invite people whose attention they would like to attract. The traditional exhibitions at Har\u00ad vard and -Boston College are big events that bring many alumni on campus. Early in April, Lewis plans to have such an exhibition with members of the Tufts community as judges. He would like this debate to become an annual event with substantial prizes given to the winners. The debate would be named in memory of a famous person and awards, named after women important in Tufts history, would be given to the best speaker and the best team. But because Tufts has a short history in public address, Lewis is having a dif\u00ad ficult time finding people to name the awards after.

Congress , Tufts trustees, and other veterinary groups. Penn Dean Robert Marshak and Cornell dean Ed\u00ad ward Melby claim that with moderate expansion their schools can serve the veterinary needs of New England. Marshak said this week that he is \"extremely pleased\" with the $5 million appropriation and will use the funds for the construction of a small animal hospital. The proposed Tufts regional veterinary school would have its main headquarters at the Tufts New EnglancJ Medical Center in Boston with clinical facilities at field stations in each of the six states. Students, who would be admitted only after college graduation, would spend two years studying on the Boston campus and two, years rotating among the state universities for clinical work.

I don't consider myself a Freudian either, however.\" Smith said there are several connections between Marx and Freud. Through different methods of analysis, they both came to conclude a harmful tendency in people is to worship groups, customs and in\u00ad stitutions -such as the traditional family or institutional religion\u00ad which preserve class inequality and supports oppression . Despite Marx,'s and Freud's understanding of how firmly entrenched these values are, Smith said, neither threw up his hands in existential despair or retreated into passive cynicism . They both had concrete proposals about how the quality of life could be improved . At this point, Smith explaihed, Marx and Freud diverged. Freud never accepted communism as the solution to man's ills, and Marx would not have endorsed individual psychoanalysis as a valid means for understanding problems that are, at the root, societal. Most psychologists , Smith said, do not try to relate Freud to history. \"In the psychology department at Tufts they would not even understand what I was talking about. From what I un\u00ad derstand, it is theoretically a bankrupt department ,\" Smith said. In what Smith said is his favorite course to teach, Psychology and Politics. he examines numerous ways that the two fields relate.
