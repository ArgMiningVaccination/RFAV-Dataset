It can reduce the chemical drugs induced toxic effects to improve the quality of life (QOL). This study applies the highestquality of clinical trial methodology to examine the role of TCM in improving QOL of postoperative non-small-cell lung cancer patients. Methods and design: This study is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Four hundred eighty patients will be recruited into seven different research centers in China. These patients that meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized into either a treatment group or a placebo group. Each group will receive treatments of 3- weekly chemotherapy with TCM or placebo for four cycles. The primary outcome will involve the evaluation of QOLand the secondary outcome assessments will include two-year disease-free survival rate and disease-free survival. Other efficacy assessments are changes of TCM symptoms and toxicity. Side effects and safety profile of the therapy would be evaluated at the same time. The investigators expect that TCM therapy combined with chemotherapy is superior tochemotherapy solely in terms of QOL improvement and disease-free survival extension. \"Intention-to-treat\" analysis will include all randomized participants. Discussion: The results from the clinical trial will provide evidence for the effectiveness of chemotherapy combined with or without TCM in QOL of postoperative NSCLC patients. Trial registration: Clinical Trials.gov (Identifier: NCT01441752). Background Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world, accounting for 26 -29% of all can- cer deaths [1]. Increasingly, lung cancer is becoming a global health problem, with greater than 1 milliondeaths annually attributed to lung cancer [2]. Non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approxi- mately 80% of all lung cancer diagnoses and more than75% of the patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage.Consequently, the prognosis for NSCLC continues to remain poor, with a 5-year survival of 15% [3]. At present, the high rate of recurrence and metastasis of postoperative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is one of the leading causes resulting in failureof treating lung cancer. More than 35% of postoperative lung cancer patients with stage I died in 5 years due to recurrence or metastasis; the 5-year survival rate of stageII, IIIa, IIIb was 31%, 17.9% and 11.7% respectively. The survival rate was improved by 5% with adjuvant chemo- therapy after resection, so regimen consist of platinum-based two chemical medicines are commended as the * Correspondence: liujiaxiang2012@126.com Department of Oncology, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of TCM, 725Wanping road, Shanghai 200032, China \u00a9 2012 Xu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2012, 12:112 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/12/112adjuvant chemotherapy for treating postoperative NSCLC patients, but the toxicity and side effects of chemotherapy such as nausea and vomiting, hair loss,and bone-marrow depression can decrease quality of life (QOL) of patients [4-6]. These adverse reactions need to be treated, otherwise which will impact the completionof treatment. Literature and preliminary studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can prolong survival and improve QOL, but high-level evi-dence is desperately needed to support this finding [7]. Over the past 10 years, many oncologists focused on survival advantage of adjuvant chemotherapy of post-operative non-small cell lung cancer patients. Data from JBR.10 study showed that overall QOL and functional domain scores are somewhat compromised after thora-cotomy and pneumonectomy; but scores improve fairly early in patients who are not receiving chemotherapy [8]. As expected, adjuvant chemotherapy has an immedi-ate negative impact on a number of aspects of QOL in individuals with NSCLC who have undergone resection with curative intent [9]. Chief among these is the symp-toms that reflect most of the serious adverse effects associated with platinum-based chemotherapy: fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Therefore, QOLin clinical assessment has become more and more prom- inent in clinical research [10]. Over the past decade, Chinese medicine has made pro- gress in the treatment of lung cancer patients. Chinese medicine has some unique advantages over chemical drugs, such as improving the quality of life, reducing re-currence rate and prolonging overall survival, etc.Regarding KPS score, traditional Chinese medicine can stabilize and improve the KPS scores after surgery in 82.0% to 90% patients [11,12]. In addition, it can im-prove QOL significantly by using NCI-L evaluation. 85% to 87.5% of postoperative patients can stabilize and improve the body weight after receiving TCM ther-apy [11-15]. Two comparative studies from Japan indi- cated Chinese herbal medicine to be effective in reduction of chemotherapy-induced muscle pain anddiarrhea [16,17]. Professor Liu Jiaxiang in Longhua hospital affiliated to Shanghai university of TCM has been doing clinical re-search on advanced lung cancer patients since the 1960s. His team have completed four prospective rando- mized clinical studies supported by China's State Scienceand Technology. The result showed that disease stable rate was 67.83%, 1, 3 and 5-year survival rate was 60.94%, 31.86% and 24.22% respectively in the treatmentgroup. Median survival was 417 days (13.9 months). The immune function and QOL were improved after treated with combined Chinese and Western medicine com-pared to the control group [18-25]. This reflected char- acteristics and therapeutic effect of Chinese medicine on treatment of lung cancer based on syndrome differenti-ation. But these studies have methodological issues and can't be widely accepted worldwide. This paper has been compiled to outline the method- ology for a randomized-controlled clinical study the ef- fect of chemotherapy combined with or without TCM in postoperative NSCLC patients that adhere tothe CONSORT [26] checklist in its design.

BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2012, 12:112 Page 2 of 6 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/12/112Study aims The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect- iveness of chemotherapy combined with or withoutTCM in QOL of postoperative NSCLC patients. The secondary aims are to compare the disease-free survival time (DFS), two-year disease-free survival rate and safetyof intervention in the two groups. Methods Study design This study is a multi-centered, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Subjects from seven clin- ical research centers in China will engage into the trial. Longhua hospital affiliated to Shanghai university of TCM, Shanghai Chest Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shang- hai Jiao Tong University, Hu adong hospital affiliated to Fudan university, NO.6 people 's hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong university and Changzheng Hospital of the Second Military Medical University. Eligible par-ticipants will be randomly allocated into either of the two groups (chemotherapy with TCM or chemotherapy with placebo) and will receive treatment for 4 cycles(Figure 1). Randomization Dynamic stratified and randomized method is applied inthis study. Random numbers will be automatically gener-ated by computer referring to pre-configured stratified factors (stages, pathological types, ages and TCM syn- dromes). Shanghai Clinical Research Center will providethe random number to each participating center. The block size and treatment-assignment table will not be available to the researchers until the end of the study. Target population and selection NSCLC patients received complete resection with con- firmed pathological diagnosis of stage Ib-IIIa; TCM syn- dromes are Yin deficiency, Qi deficiency, Qi and Yindeficiency, Spleen and Kidney deficiency. Diagnostic criteria Diagnostic criteria for primary bronchial lung cancer: According to the \"New compiled diagnosis and treat- ment norms of common malignant tumors\" (Volume IX- primary bronchial lung cancer, the Chinese Anti- Cancer Association compiled, Beijing: Chinese Union Medical University Press, 1997: 737 -781). TNM stage of primary bronchial lung cancer: Accord- ing to the staging system of 2009 International Union Against Cancer (UICC), version 7.Syndrome differentiation criteria Syndrome differentiation criteria based on \"The GuidingPrinciples of Clinical Research of New Chinese Medicine(trial)\" (China Pharmaceutical Technology Publishing House, 2002) and \"Shanghai diagnosis and treatment routine of TCM Syndrome\"(Shanghai Municipal HealthBureau edit). Four syndromes of TCM are set as follows: Qi deficiency syndrome is composed of the following symptoms: coughing, phlegm, poor appetite, spiritless-ness and weakness, light and plump tongue; secondary symptoms of spontaneous sweating, loose stool or soft slippery pulse. Yin deficiency syndrome contains main symptoms of coughing, less phlegm, dry mouth, red tongue; secondary symptoms of the night sweating, heartburn and insom-nia, low fever, thread and rapid pulse. Qi and Yin deficiency syndrome contains main symp- toms of coughing, less phlegm, shortness of breath, spir-itlessness and weakness, thirst without the desire to drink; secondary symptoms of spontaneous sweating, night sweating, reddish tongue or tongue with teethmarks, and thread and weak pulse. Spleen and Kidney deficiency syndrome contains main symptoms of coughing, shortness of breath, dyspneaafter movements, weakly coughing; secondary symptoms of soreness of loins, tinnitus, loose stool, spiritlessness and weakness, light tongue or tongue with teeth marks,and deep thready and weak pulse. The diagnosis can be given with the conditions of at least two of the main symptoms and one of the second-ary symptoms. Inclusion criteria Meet the diagnostic criteria of primary bronchial lung cancer, and pathologically or cytologically confirmed of squamouscarcinoma, adenocarcinoma, adenosquamouscarcinoma or large cell carcinoma of the lung, age be- tween 18 and 75 years old; TCM syndromes are Yin defi- ciency, Qi deficiency, Qi and Yin deficiency or Spleenand Kidney deficiency, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of two or less, Stage Ib ~ IIIa with complete resection, first chemotherapytreatment within 6 weeks after operation, normal hematological function with total neutrophil count >1.5 \u00d7 normal liver func- tion and kidney function, voluntarily involved to clinical study and sign informed consent. Exclusion criteria Suffering from other primary malignant tumors; incom- plete resection or uncertain to take resection; seriousproblem of heart, liver or kidney with severe dysfunc- tion; being pregnant or breast-feeding, mental or cogni- tive disorders that would influence judgment of QOL inXuet al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2012, 12:112 Page 3 of 6 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/12/112this study; during the period of adjuvant chemotherapy, or prior chemotherapy; being participating other drug trials; allergy to the drug in the study. Any patient withproblems mentioned above will be excluded from this clinical study. Sample size Refer to the results of JRB.10 study, for early lung cancer patients after three-month adjuvant chemotherapy, theQOL score assessed by QLQ-C30 scale decreased 27% compared with baseline. The sample size of this study is based on the validity of assumptions and clinical experi-ence of the past. Compared to the baseline, it is esti- mated that the QOL score assessed by QLQ-C30 scale for patients treated with three-month postoperative ad-juvant chemotherapy, there was 15% of patients with no deterioration of QOL combined with TCM than treat- ment without TCM. Inspection level = 0.05, grasp 1- beta = 0.90, compared with the baseline, the QOL score assessed by QLQ-C30 scale after three-months in the treatment group decline 12% while 27% in the controlgroup, made 198 cases of sample size in each group and consider 20% off rate, it is expected that the research team observed 480 cases (n = 240 cases) of patients in2 years to compare QOL of postoperative NSCLC patients by chemotherapy with or without TCM. Intervention Researchers will undertake a one-day training course for this trial. This course will cover the study protocol,the recording method for the clinical record form (CRF), and basic information about clinical research, a researcher's responsibility and research monitoring. Chemotherapy The chemotherapy for NSCLC patients is a combinationof Vinorelbine, 25 mg/m 2, d1, 8 and DDP, 75 mg/m2,d 1 (NP) giving three-weekly for four cycles. For patients who receive fewer than the intended number of cycles ofchemotherapy, the study duration will be calculated by the basis of the projected interval. Chinese herbal medicine Prescriptions formulated into granules origin from Pro- fessor Liu Jiaxiang in Longhua hospital. Package of gran-ules is made into three types with functions such as benefiting Qi recipe, benefiting Yin recipe and detoxica- tion and resolving masses recipe (Table 1). Each packagecontained 20 g of water-soluble herbal granules that were manufactured at a Good Manufacture Practice standard facility (Tian Jiang Ltd, Jiangyin, China). Eachpackage was labeled with a serial number. The prescrip- tion form comprised the stock list with both the name and serial number.Placebo It is difficult to define a pure placebo in Chinese herbalmedicine where all natural substances are potentiallytherapeutic. So we compromise the raw materials for the placebo including 10% of Chinese medicine, food color and artificial flavors. The placebo and therapeutic packages were stored in different cabinets, and only the dispensing technician knew the contents of the packages. Primary outcome measurement Quality of life Quality of life scale: QLQ-LC43 scales made by EORTC will be applied to assess the quality of life of patients.Scoring method is used to assess the results according to the score changes [27]. Scores of general QOL and each field is calculated respectively by international uni-form scoring system prior and after intervention. Per- formance status of patients physical conditions are assessed according to ECOG PS standard before andafter each treatment. Secondary outcome assessments Two-year disease-free survival rate: the patients without recurrence and metastasis within 2 years after resection account for percentage of all patients. Disease-free survival (DFS) :it refers to the interval time either from the first date of medication to that of recurrence and metastasis observed, or death for anyreason (record according to the first event). The date of last evaluation will be recorded if patients either have no recurrence and metastasis when reach censored data, orloss of follow-up. Other outcome assessments Evaluation of TCM symptoms changes The symptoms scores are made, recorded and calculated based on graded scale of lung cancer symptoms requiredin \"The Guiding Principles of Clinical Research of New Chinese Medicine treating Primary Bronchial Lung Can- cer\" (2002) issued by the State Drug Administration be-fore and after each treatment. The total scores of single symptom are TCM symptoms scores, and symptoms ef- ficacy assessments are based on the changes before andafter treatment. Safety assessment Blood routine, liver and kidney function, urination and stool routine and EKG will be measured before and after treatment to assess the toxicity and side effects of eachgroup according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V3.0 (CTC AE) issued by National Can- cer Institute (NCI) (http: // ctep.info. nih.gov).Xuet al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2012, 12:112 Page 4 of 6 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/12/112AEs is recorded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V3.0 (CTC AE) made by Na- tional Cancer Institute (NCI) (http://ctep.info.nih.gov)after treatment each week. Adverse events (AE) Adverse events including toxicity and side effects shouldbe reported according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V3.0 (CTC AE) issued by National Cancer Institute (NCI) (http://ctep.info.nih.gov). All un-expected responses possibly or clearly related to the re- search will be reported. If serious adverse events (SAE) occur, experimental treatments will be stopped immedi-ately and appropriate treatments will be offered. The type and frequency of adverse events will be reported for each group. Statistical analysis All the clinical data will be saved in computers after col- lection work and database will be set up by Microsoft Access 2007 software. Statistical analysis will be con-ducted on an intention-to-treat basis with a 95% confi- dence interval using the SPSS 16.0 statistical package. For analysis of baseline characteristics, either two-sample t tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continu- ous data and Chi-squared tests or Fisher 's exact tests for categorical data will be conducted after the test for nor-mality. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses should be used for calculating median survival time (MST), Long-Rank is used between two groups. A significance level of 5%will be used throughout the analysis. Experts of Shanghai Medical Clinical Research Centre will be invited to man- age the statistic analysis. Discussion The aim of this study is to prove that whether chemo- therapy combined with TCM treatment can improve patients' quality of life and prolong survival. We havepresented the design and protocol for a placebo- controlled, double-blinded RCT that will provide evi- dence for the effectiveness of chemotherapy combinedwith or without TCM in QOL of postoperative NSCLC patients. The result will provide support for integrative optimization of the treatment of lung cancer patients.Competing interests All the authors have no conflicts of interest.
