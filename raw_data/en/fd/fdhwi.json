Nearly 46 per cent of Canadians take at least one nutritional supplement, according to Statistics Canada \u2014 and their use is even more prevalent among older women. As it's the time of year for health resolutions, why not take the opportunity to make sure your vitamins and supplements are right for you? While it's wise to do some of your own research, consulting a trained pharmacist before taking any new supplement can further protect your health. \"I recommend that when people are shopping for supplements, they stay at their own pharmacy, so the pharmacist knows what medications they're taking,\" says Amin Hirji, pharmacy manager of the Walmart Supercentre in Stouffville, Ont. Even the most natural of supplements can interact with medications, which could be an issue for the 55 per cent of Canadian adults who, according to Statistics Canada, take prescription drugs. \"Supplements can increase or decrease the effectiveness of other medications. Or your supplement might not work as well,\" says Hirji, who's been a pharmacist for over 20 years. When recommending a vitamin or supplement, he'll often consider a person's age \u2014 so don't be offended if a pharmacist asks how old you are \u2014 as well as existing health conditions and any prescriptions they're taking. Choosing the right vitamins for you Hirji says any product made by a recognizable name brand \u2014 such as Walmart's [Equate label ](https://www.walmart.ca/search?q=Equate%20vitamins)\u2014 should be safe and reliable. If you're not sure, check that the product has a [Natural Product Number](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/natural-non-prescription/applications-submissions/product-licensing/licensed-natural-health-products-database.html) (NPN), which is issued by Health Canada. Many supplements come in tablet form, which are slowly absorbed by the body. In contrast, gel caplets, chewables, oils, liquids and effervescent tablets that are dissolvable in water will be taken up by the body more rapidly. But Hirji notes that, in the end, the body gets the same amount of active ingredient. Anything that can be taken on the tongue or as a liquid, meanwhile, might be more suitable for children, the elderly and people with certain health conditions. \"Some people don't like swallowing,\" Hirji says. Increasingly, people are asking for vegan products. Hirji says it may say on the label if it's vegan, or you may have to comb through the ingredients list. Ask a pharmacist for help, as they will be able to assess a product quickly for you. [Multivitamins](https://www.walmart.ca/search?q=equate%20multivitamin&c=6000199008297) Nearly one quarter of Canadians take a multivitamin, according to Statistics Canada, and Hirji says he fields many questions about this popular choice. \"I definitely recommend a multivitamin, just to make sure they're getting the recommended daily allowance for vitamins and minerals,\" he says. \"I take one myself every day, and so do my parents \u2014 it's very important for the elderly.\" The different formulations of multivitamins matter \u2014 whether they're tailored to men, women, seniors, children or pregnant women, for example, as the ingredients will vary accordingly. For instance, products made for women will usually contain additional calcium, iron and folic acid. [Vitamin D](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/equate-calcium-with-vitamin-d-unisex/6000196184816) \"It's good for bones and teeth,\" says Hirji, as D helps the body absorb calcium. There may be a link between low levels of D and some cancers and Multiple Sclerosis. Since Canadians may not get enough in their diet or from sunlight in winter months, [Health Canada recommends](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/vitamins-minerals/vitamin-calcium-updated-dietary-reference-intakes-nutrition.html) children and adults get 600 international units (IU) a day, and 800 IU for those individuals over 70. Vitamin D also helps boost the immune system \u2014 another reason to take the supplement during cold and flu season. Taking calcium at the same time as a D supplement helps your body absorb it better. Drops or a pill form are both fine. \"It depends on the patient's preference,\" Hirji says. \"A lot of the younger generation are on the go and will put a drop on their finger or in the food.\" [Vitamin C](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/equate-vitamin-c-1000mg-time-release-unisex/6000198431864) Although vitamin C has long been touted as a cold remedy, research indicates \u2014 as described in [this fact sheet ](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-Consumer/)from the Office of Dietary Supplements at the U.S. National Institutes of Health \u2014 that, for most people, vitamin C supplements don't help with cold prevention. However, the same organization advises that people who take vitamin C supplements regularly may have slightly shorter colds or milder cold symptoms when sick. Hirji likes to know about the health conditions of people who want to take C, as it can make kidney stones worse. Due to the acidic nature of the vitamin, those who opt for chewable tablets should brush their teeth 30 minutes after consuming to prevent possible tooth erosion. [Vitamin A](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/equate-vitamin-a-10000iu-unisex/6000203202998) This vitamin may help with vision and the overall immune system, and, due to the latter benefit, Hirji says he gets many questions about it during the winter. But he advises pregnant people to speak with their pharmacists before supplementing with A, as a daily dose greater than 10,000 IU has been linked to birth defects. When it comes to taking care of your eyes, you should also make sure to get them checked annually at a [Walmart Vision Centre.](https://www.walmart.ca/browse/health/vision-centre/6000199008297-21023) [Probiotics](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/equate-probiotic-formula-30-billion-unisex/6000199622706) \"This is definitely a great product to take,\" says Hirji, who especially recommends them for women on birth-control pills and for those who have recently taken antibiotics, as they help build up healthy gut bacteria. He says specialized probiotics products are now available, including one that helps with eczema \u2014 his own daughter has found it helpful for her skin. [Omega 3 fatty acids](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/equate-extra-strength-omega-3-value-size-1200mg-420-epa-280-dha-unisex/6000195549660) These supplements may help with inflammation related to arthritis, heart disease, eye health and diabetes. Importantly, these supplements are quite safe for most people to take, says Hirji. (As with any supplement, it's still a good idea to consult with your pharmacist before taking.) [Chromium](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/equate-chromium-200mcg-unisex/6000197849562) Hirji has seen an increase in demand for this mineral, which, as indicated by HealthLink B.C., may be [modestly helpful in regulating blood sugar ](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-topics/chromium)in people with Type-2 diabetes. He recommends people at risk for diabetes get tested \u2014 which they can do at the [ pharmacy](https://www.walmart.ca/browse/health/6000199008297) \u2014 and work with their doctor as well to monitor their health. In fact, that's good advice for anyone who's looking in the supplements aisle to improve their health. Working closely with your doctor and a pharmacist to get the right products for you can make all the difference. Start off the new year in a healthy way by [consulting with a Walmart pharmacist](https://www.walmart.ca/cp/shop/pharmacy-services-near-me/6000203002153) to get the right vitamin regimen for you. Save time on subsequent purchases by ordering vitamins online and picking them up for free at the store or delivered to your door (at select locations).
