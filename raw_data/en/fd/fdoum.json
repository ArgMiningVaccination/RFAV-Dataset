COVID-19 is a clinical diagnosis; a confirmed antigen or PCR test is not required. Treatment should be initiated immediately after the onset of flu-like symptoms. The multiple therapies and drugs in this protocol have different mechanisms of action and work synergistically during various phases of the disease. The information in this document is our recommended approach to COVID-19 based on the best (and most recent) literature. It is provided as guidance to healthcare providers worldwide on the early treatment of COVID-19. Patients should always consult with their provider before starting any medical treatment. New medications may be added and/or changes made to doses of existing medications as further evidence emerges. Please be sure you are using the latest version of this protocol. A note about anesthesia and surgery: Please notify your anesthesia team if you are using the following medications and/or nutraceuticals as they can increase the risk of Serotonin Syndrome \u2014 a life-threatening condition \u2014 when opioids are administered: - Methylene - Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) For more information on nutritional therapeutics and how they can help with COVID-19, visit [our guide to Nutritional Therapeutics.](https://covid19criticalcare.com/nutritional-therapeutics-and-covid-19/) For more information on vitamins and nutraceuticals during pregnancy, visit [our guide to Vitamins and Nutraceuticals During Pregnancy](https://covid19criticalcare.com/vitamins-and-nutraceuticals-during-pregnancy/). First Line Therapies (In order of priority; not all required.) Second Line Therapies (In order of priority/importance.) Add to first line therapies above if: 1) more than 5 days of symptoms; 2) poor response to first line agents; 3) significant comorbidities). Treatment of BA.4/BA.5/BQ.1.1 and XBB1 Variants Treatment of Current Circulating Omicron variants Limited data are available on the clinical implications of the current circulating Omicron 'subvariants', however these variants have demonstrated 'neutralization escape', meaning they have evolved to escape neutralizing antibodies from previous infections or from mRNA injection. Indeed, vaccination appears to be a risk factor for symptomatic disease. The newer variants seem to differ from previous variants due to the early onset of bacterial pneumonia. While the optimal treatment approach to the symptomatic patient is unclear, it is best to risk-stratify symptomatic patients. Risk factors for hospitalization and death include advanced age (over 60), comorbidities (especially obesity and metabolic syndrome, poor ambulatory status, delayed treatment, high D-dimer), recently vaccinated, and severe symptoms. High-risk patients should consider: If symptoms have not markedly improved by day 3 of treatment, one of the following antibiotics should be started. NOTE: providers should prescribe an antibiotic at the first visit. Hypoxia/shortness of breath: If the patients develop hypoxia or shortness of breath Prednisolone 60 mg daily for 5 days should be prescribed. About Ivermectin Ivermectin is a well known, FDA-approved drug that has been used successfully around the world for more than four decades. One of the safest drugs known, it is on the WHO's list of essential medicines, has been given over 3.7 billion times, and won the Nobel Prize for its global and historic impacts in eradicating endemic parasitic infections in many parts of the world. To review the totality of supporting evidence for ivermectin in COVID-19, visit our [Ivermectin information page.](https://covid19criticalcare.com/ivermectin/) Ivermectin is a remarkably safe drug with minimal adverse reactions (almost all minor), however its safety in pregnancy has not been definitively established. Talk to your doctor about use in pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester. Potential drug-drug interactions should be reviewed before prescribing ivermectin. Ivermectin has been demonstrated to be highly effective against the Omicron variant at a dose of 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg, when taken early. Higher doses (0.6 mg/kg) may be required: in regions with more aggressive variants; if treatment starts on or after 5 days of symptoms; in patients in advanced stage of the disease or who have extensive risk factors (i.e., older age, obesity, diabetes, etc.) Table 1. How to calculate ivermectin dose Note that ivermectin is available in different strengths (e.g., 3, 6 or 12 mg) and administration forms (tablets, capsules, drops, etc.). Note that tablets can be halved for more accurate dosing, while capsules cannot. |How much do I weigh?||What Raise Serum IU||If is solely for educational purposes regarding potentially beneficial therapies for COVID-19.
