Alternative medicines are considered treatment modalities not considered standard of care in allopathic medicine but may have known benefits historically, and are valued in many cultures of healing not recognized by Western medicine. Many CAM practices that are highly valued or often used, though not within the mainstream, may still have evidence based medicine and patient research behind them. Herbal medications and some supplements have showed promise in helping ailments like migraine headaches, mood disorders, and arthritic pain. In addition to herbal therapies, CAM encompasses acupuncture, cupping, yoga, massage, guided meditation, homeopathy to name a few. By working with Uplift Health, patients are supported to find the most promising treatment modalities that may improve their health with the lowest risk profile that can support their care in both an allopathic (traditional medicine) and integrative medicine setting. Uplift health values safety and medical evidence along with low risk modalities that may have high benefit. I loved the bodywork component that went into the Japanese style of acupuncture that Dr. Trowbridge practices. Dr. Trowbridge is a great balance of integrative medicine, with her MD education and holistic care background and personal lifestyle. Highly recommend! Very knowledgeable and intuitive in offering acupuncture. Cozy and inviting space. After just a few visits my arthritis pain has become manageable. I am very pleased. "}
