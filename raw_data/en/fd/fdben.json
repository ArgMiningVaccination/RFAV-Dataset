Welcome to the 23rd edition of The Weekly. This week 's papers includ e two important topics: a World Health Organization framework to guide the equitable distribution of COVID -19 vaccines; and the potential role of mass testing to control viral transmission, linked to the development of new virus detection assays. The WHO Str ategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) outlined a framework for the allocation and prioriti sation of COVID -19 vaccination.(1) The framework is values -based, anchored to the ideal that COVID -19 vaccines contribute to the equitable protectio n and promotion of human well -being among all people of the world. The framework provides six core principles to guide distribution: human well -being, equal respect, global equity, national equity, reciprocity and legitimacy. Such an approach is critical t o equitable and ethical decision -making, and similar documents are being produced from academic groups across the world, (2) and in individual countries, including the United States. (3) As academics and global citizens, we must do our best to advocate key international organisations such as WHO, COVAX and CEPI, vaccine producers and national governments for fair and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. However, the timing of the availability and deployment of vaccine/s is unknown, and there are man y uncertainties along the path, including results of efficacy studies, concerns around vaccine safety, capacity for vaccine production, individuals ' appetite for vaccine uptake and the ability of agencies to deliver the vaccine. In the meantime, government s, policymakers and academics continue to pursue strategies to reduce transmission of SARS -CoV -2 and to minimise the clinical and socio -economic impacts of COVID -19. As we have seen across the globe, these strategies are many and varied. Mass testing is on e such strategy. This week, the British Medical Journal reported on \" Operation Moonshot \", a plan by the U .K. government to do a mass population testing programme for COVID -19, with the aim to test the whole U .K. population each week, starting early 2021.(4) REF Mass testing has been advocated by several experts, including by a group of academics across the U .K. in early May.(5) Some, including Paul Sax, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, have suggested that mass testing will be critical in con trolling the pandemic before a vaccine is available.(6) COVID- 19 KIDS EVIDENCE UPDATE http://go.unimelb.edu.au/qp3r WEEKLY UPDATE NO. 23 4 The theory behind this approach is \" test, test, test \" - that is: test to detect people who may have the virus during the period before becoming symptomatic; test as many people as possible to detect as many cases as is possible; and test people where it is easy for them to do so, for example, at home. Michae l Mina, a virologist and epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, advocates for a rapid test that people can do at home before leaving for the day - a \"COVID check \", if you will - Prof Mina gives an easily digestible summary of this approach here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZWuyvBAWWQ New rapid tests are being developed at pace. Highlighted in this week 's Weekly, investigators at M.I.T. describe the development of a rapid test for detection of SARS -CoV -2 that combines simple extraction of viral R .N.A. with isothermal amplification , and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) mediated detection. (7) The test, known as STOP (SHERLOCK in a pot) takes less than one hour and has a similar sensitivity to reverse -transcription - quantitative polymerase -chain -reaction (RT -qPCR) assays. This is an exciting advance. However, such technology is not what is needed for a mass testing approach. What is needed is a cheap, accurate, super-rapid, easy to use, home- based, paper antigen test - a bit like an over -the - counter pregnancy test. These tests, by their nature, will not be as sensitive as the STOP test or the RT-PCR tests, but advocates argue that this is acceptable for two reasons: 1) detection of SARS- CoV -2 by these tests are in the range of viral copies per mL consistent with the transmissible virus; and 2) these tests will be repeated frequently in individuals so that if the tests fail to detect the virus on one day, it will detect it the following day. (8) Whilst a mass testing approach may sound good in theory, there is currently little detail behind the U.K. plan, and there are some fairly large barriers. First, the type of test described above is not yet readily available. (9) Second, there is the cost - the B .M.J. report suggests that GBP100 billion (~AUD175 billion) has been budgeted for the program. Third, the sheer capacity of testing is mind - boggling - Operation Moonshot aims to increase testing in the U.K. from the current 350,000 to up to 10 million tests per day - this will require a massive scale- up in production, distribution, reporting and tracking of tests. Fourth, false positives present a concerning ethical issue - even if the test has a specif icity of 99%, thousands of people will be incorrectly given a diagnosis of SASR- CoV -2 infection. Finally, beyond modelling, there is no empirical evidence base to support such an approach. (10) What happens with Operation Moonshot remains to be seen. Edito rials in the B .M.J. with titles such as \" Flying before we can walk \" reflect scepticism from some, but thinking continues on how to best prevent and control the transmission of SARS -CoV -2 while we wait for a safe and effective vaccine. (11) Many will argue that we must continue to do our best with the approaches that have been shown to work so far in the pandemic. Finally, a huge congratulations and thanks to the Editorial Team and reviewers involved in producing the Weekly, especially the medical student co mmittee and contributors. The Weekly is a great read and a fantastic contribution from the Melbourne Children 's Campus. COVID- 19 KIDS EVIDENCE UPDATE http://go.unimelb.edu.au/qp3r WEEKLY UPDATE NO. 23 5 1. WHO.

Inferred by maximum likelihood estimation; best fit Weibull distribution; mean of 5.5 days . - Time from onset of symptoms to transmission (TOST): time elapsed between onset of symptoms in the index case, and transmission from index to the second ary case (positive for symptomatic transmission, negative for pre - symptomatic transmission) .

However, despite recognition for early on in the pandemic that the health of \" Communities of Colour \" have been disproportionately affected, there have been only three articles on racial inequality and COVID -19 from Brazil (compared to 302 from elsewhere) and as of 12th July, less than 0.01% of CO VID-19 scientific papers referenced racial inequality. Reasons for this lack of published research may include: limited data collected and shared by public health agencies; incomplete data or data that are collected are undervalued; lack of perceived impor tance surrounding the topic; and lack of statistics reported by the government that includes race. > Baqui and colleagues excluded 38.7% of patients with SARS-CoV -2 because of missing data of race even though the collection of such data in Brazil is required by law - indicating that a legal requirement is being routinely ignored. > In Brazil, race is viewed as phenotypic and not ancestry based. Darker- skinned individuals have an increased incidence of racism and worse health indicators. The black community face s barriers to accessing health services and achieving better living conditions. > The COVID -19 pandemic has coincided with the Black Lives Matter movement.

Larger airborne particles may not have been as well sampled from the air, but surfaces near the patient likely to be contamin ated were swabbed. > Conclusion: Whilst findings support the position that fomite and aerosol transmission were of relatively low risk among these COVID -19 patients, results may also be consistent with aerosol transmission occurring early on in the course of the disease, well before COVID -19 patients are ill enough to require hospitalisation. This requires further assessment.

Hence, the final vaccination strategy will be defined by the characteristics of vaccine products as they become availabl e.

(viewpoint) https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2770123 > This viewpoint suggests that children may be a potential target for mandatory vaccination, given that several vaccines are already mandatory to attend school . > They suggest in this article that the approach to the influenza vaccine (not mandatory) should inform the approach to a COVID -19 vaccine . > One important difference between COVID-19 & influenza is the role children play in transmission; children have been well documented in spreading i nfluenza ; however initial reports suggest children transmit SARS -CoV -2 less easily than the influenza virus, and this is an area undergoing intensive research internationally . > Despite this, SARS -CoV -2 appears to spread more efficiently than influenza, whic h the authors ' reason may make SARS-CoV -2 a good candidate for a mandatory vaccine . > There are nine criteria to consider when evaluating antigens for inclusion in mandatory school immunisation programs: - Experience with the vaccine containing this antigen in dicates that it is safe, and has an acceptable level of adverse effects (prioritised criterion). - An antigen is effective as measured by immunogenicity and population -based prevention . - A vaccine is as cost -effective as other vaccines . - A vaccine should bear some relationship to increasing safety in the school environment . - A vaccine prevents disease with significant morbidity/mortality in at least some subset of the population . - Vaccinating the infant, child, or adolescent against disease reduces the risk of person -to-person transmission . - A vaccine is acceptable to the medical community & the public . - Administrative burdens of delivery are reasonable. - The b urden of adherence for the vaccine is reasonable for parent/caregiver. > With the above framework of criteri a, the article concludes that too little is known about the performance of any of the candidate COVID -19 vaccines, and the epidemiology of SARS -CoV -2 in children to make a firm judgement on mandating a vaccine . > A major limitation of the paper is that it do es not highlight that children do not get severe COVID -19 disease at anywhere near the rates of older adults and making a vaccine mandatory for certain groups should relate to both individual and community (herd) protection. COVID- 19 KIDS EVIDENCE UPDATE http://go.unimelb.edu.au/qp3r WEEKLY UPDATE NO. 23 38 > Lastly, this paper does not mention the lack of clinical SARS -CoV -2 vaccine trials that include children. The large Phase 3 trials being operated internationally have, to -date, largely excluded children, recruiting adults > 18 years. We should not even be considerin g making COVID -19 vaccine mandatory in children until we see that they are safe and efficacious in this population. Due to vaccine supply constraints, it is unlikely children will be part of the 1st phase of vaccine roll -out. Mandatory vaccination is a con tentious issue and can have an impact on vaccine confidence, especially when there is a lack of evidence in that target group. Let' s leave children out of the mandatory vaccine debate, at least until we have seen the data.
