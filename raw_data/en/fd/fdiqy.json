Steiner was an Austrian philosopher, social reformer, and the founder of anthroposophy (a \"science of the spirit\"), shortly before World War I. He argued that human beings lived both on earth and in the spiritual world, but warned that growing materialism had opened a gap with the spiritual world which needed to be reversed. Anthroposophy was at the time, and has continued to be widely considered, as esoteric and outlandish. Yet for his followers it became the fundamental drivers of societal, ethical, and environmental challenges of modern societies, and a holistic vision of what was needed to overcome them. A distinctive feature of Steiner and his followers was an interest in practical solutions. They sketched, for example, the principles for biodynamic agriculture and pharmaceuticals made from natural ingredients. Steiner himself founded a Swiss natural medicine company called Weleda, which developed a large international business. Over the course of the following decades anthroposophists created large organic food and drink companies and pioneered social banking in Europe. Within this broader context, the paper looks in particular at entrepreneurs in wine, food and tea. Biodynamic agriculture involves esoteric and apparently bizarre practices, yet it has served as the basis for the creation of premium brands and companies with high levels of environmental and social responsibility. Biodynamic wines, such as those made by Frey Vineyards in California, came to dominate wine competitions. The tea company Ambootia, the largest tea producer in Darjeeling, used biodynamic methods to turn a pretty low-quality product into a premium tea sold extensively in Europe. Aarstiderne, a large Danish online food retailer, had employed innovative IT methods to deliver biodynamic food to customers, and now has revenues of $100 million. The paper explores how an alternative, and global, view of the world has served as the basis for successful capitalist enterprises. "}
