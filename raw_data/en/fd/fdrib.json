Advocate recognizes that health experts are expecting COVID to become endemic - a constant presence we'll have to vaccinate against and treat in the U.S., just like the flu. We're dedicated in our efforts to keep each other safe. Review our [visitor policy](/about-us/visitor-policy) before coming in for appointments or visiting someone at an Advocate location. Masks are optional at Advocate locations. We appreciate patients, visitors, vendors and delivery personnel screening themselves for COVID symptoms before entering our locations. We want you to be as healthy as possible for your procedure. Depending on your vaccination status, whether or not you're immunocompromised and your planned procedure, your doctor might require you to get tested for COVID a few days beforehand. We're distributing updated COVID shots to anyone 6 months and older. The Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines are now a single shot of the updated (also called \"bivalent\") vaccine. There's no longer a difference between a primary vaccination and a booster. The Moderna COVID vaccine for children ages 6 months to 5 years is also the same as the updated vaccine, but in a series of smaller doses that are the right size for them. We're distributing COVID shots to anyone 6 months old and older as follows: Yes, the vaccines for children have the same active ingredients as the vaccines for adults, but children receive a smaller dose that's the right size for them. Your child should get the vaccine made for their age group. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends children who meet the eligibility criteria get vaccinated. The COVID vaccines available in the U.S. are very safe and effective against most variants. While vaccinated people can get infected, the chances of getting very sick or dying from COVID are much less than for those who are not vaccinated. Yes. According to the CDC, it's safe to get the COVID vaccine at the same time as other vaccines. Emergency use authorization, or EUA, means unapproved medical products can be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases, assuming safety and quality criteria have been met. No serious safety concerns were reported while the vaccines were tested in trials, and the FDA also conducted a thorough evaluation to ensure the vaccines met its standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality. We're distributing updated COVID shots to anyone 6 months old and older as follows: For added protection, people 65 and older can receive another dose four months after their last shot. Most immunocompromised people can get a second COVID shot as a booster two months after their last COVID shot. For immunocompromised children 6 months through 4 years of age, eligibility for additional doses depends on the vaccine previously received. Please see the [CDC's guidance for immunocompromised people](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html) for more information. Yes. Talk to your doctor if you're not sure what treatments you received or if you need more guidance about getting vaccinated. Do not get the updated COVID shot if you were treated for an allergic reaction within four hours after receiving a previous COVID vaccine or booster. You also should not get vaccinated if you've had a severe allergic reaction to any component of any of the vaccines. The Pfizer vaccine components are: mRNA, lipids dibasic sodium phosphate hydrochloride, acetic acid, sodium acetate and sucrose. The vaccines are very effective in pregnant women. The CDC recommends women who are pregnant or breastfeeding get the COVID vaccine. What's more, pregnant women are more likely to get severely ill with COVID compared to nonpregnant women, according to the CDC. Schedule an appointment for yourself or someone 6 months old or older by calling [866-443-2584](tel:18664432584) or by contacting your primary care provider. You can also contact your child's pediatrician or visit a local retail pharmacy to plan your COVID vaccination. It's recommended that people who have had COVID get the vaccine. However, if you're still contagious, you should delay your vaccine appointment until you're no longer contagious. Contact your doctor if you're not sure if you're contagious. The most commonly reported side effects in trials included pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, nausea and fever. Side effects such as these often indicate a person's immune system is responding to the vaccine. Minor side effects are common after a vaccine, and our providers will help you understand and manage them. If you experience something more serious than a side effect after getting vaccinated, contact your health care provider to get care right away. You could experience some discomfort and soreness from the injection as well as nonserious effects. Our providers will explain any side effects before you get the vaccine. Like adults, children may also experience common side effects such as headaches, muscle pain, fatigue or fever. Common side effects in children 3 years old and younger include irritability, sleepiness and loss of appetite. Everyone who receives a vaccine will be monitored by our providers for 15-30 minutes after vaccination. We're prepared to respond quickly and appropriately should anyone experience an allergic reaction. Our in-home vaccination program is for patients enrolled in our home programs. We recommend others contact their local health department. If you got your vaccination at an Advocate Health Care location, you can get a copy of your immunization history in the [LiveWell app or website](https://www.advocateaurorahealth.org/livewell/). You can also request a copy from your primary care provider or check with the vaccine clinic to see if it can provide you with a replacement card. Other options include the state health department's immunization information system. You can find [state Immunization Information Systems (IIS) information](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/contacts-locate-records.html) on the CDC website or [v-safe](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html) if you enrolled in this tool. If you didn't get your vaccine at an Advocate location, contact your vaccination provider to access your vaccination record. If you can't contact your vaccination provider directly, contact your state health department's immunization information system. You can find [state IIS information](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/contacts-locate-records.html) on the CDC website. Vaccination providers are required to report COVID vaccinations to their IIS and related systems. Rely on the CDC for safety guidance and find answers to common questions about COVID.
