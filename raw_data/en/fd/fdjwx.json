While risk could be same around the world, exposure is not the same, because of differences in levels of contamination and dietary habits in various parts of the world, habitat, temperature conditions, humidity level etc. Fungal contamination of dried products leading to the production of aflatoxins has been reported worldwide but it is more expressed in the developing countries. It has been estimated that around half of the fungi found in the environment could cause infections in people (mycosis). There are more than 5 billion people in developing countries at risk of chronic exposure to aflatoxins through contaminated foods (1). Spices and aromatic herbs would be inappropriate for consumption after being contaminated by mycotoxins produced by fungi during growth, harvesting, postharvest, or transportation, inadequate conditions of drying (sun drying on the floor, on the sidewalks, extended drying times) and postharvest storage practices (unhygienic condition and an instable environmental conditions) (2). A recent study documented the significant occurrence of molds and aflatoxins in spices and aromatic herb powders mostly used by consumers in Benin and neighboring countries. It has been recommended that the presence of molds and aflatoxins should be controlled during all the food chain including plant growth, processing, and storage steps, sorting before processing, control of water activity in spices, temperature of storage room, and an audit of molds species involved in the production of aflatoxins. (3) The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies botanical products as drugs (drug must have an approved marketing application) or dietary supplements (regulated by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994) and to ensure the effective protection of public health, products that contain contaminants exceeding allowable levels should not be allowed on the market and dietary supplements should be precisely labeled for myco-toxicological and microbiological contamination.(4) It is estimated that approximately 80% of the population in developing countries uses traditional herbal medicines as part of their primary health care (5, 6). Among the main safety risks related to herbal medicines is contamination by microorganisms of various kinds that may be adherent to leaves, stems, flowers, seeds, and roots from which herbal medicines are prepared. A study has demonstrated that the use of homemade and commercial herbal medicines is a major risk to the health due to the lack of microbial quality standards. (7) Hence it is important that in addition to house assessment letter, letters should be issued for quality audit of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) in pharmacies or industries that handle herbal medicines/ herbal food supplements. 1.
