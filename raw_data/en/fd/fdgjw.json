Videos: Immunization Schedules: Immunization FAQs - Question The patient did not receive the full volume of their dose, what do I do? - Answer - Any vaccination using less than the standard dose should not be counted, and the person should be revaccinated according to age unless serologic testing indicates that an adequate response has developed. However, if 2 half-volume formulations of vaccine have already been administered on the same clinic day to a patient recommended for the full volume formulation, these 2 doses can count as one full dose. Examples: inappropriately divided doses, syringe, applicator, or needle leakage. - Question What are typical needle specifications? - Answer - Intramuscular - Gauge: 22-25 - 1-inch needle or larger is required to ensure intramuscular administration, If the subcutaneous and muscle tissue are bunched to minimize the chance of striking bone. - Administer at a 90-degree angle - Age specifics visit [ACIP ](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/administration.html) Subcutaneous - Gauge: 23-25 - -inch - Administer 45-degree angle Other routes of administration: Visit [ACIP ](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/administration.html) - Question Do immunizations administered by the wrong route need to be repeated? - Answer - Not usually. Vaccines should always be given by the route recommended by the manufacturer because data regarding safety and efficacy of alternative routes is limited. However, ACIP recommends that vaccines given by the wrong route be counted as valid with two exceptions; Hepatitis B and Rabies vaccine must be given IM and in adults, in the deltoid or anterolateral thigh muscle in order to be counted as valid. If either is given in the gluteal site the immunization must be repeated. - Question Can I administer multiple vaccinations in one visit? - Answer - Yes. For older children and adults, the deltoid muscle can be used for more than one intramuscular injection. If a vaccine and an immune globulin preparation are administered simultaneously (e.g.,Td/Tdap and tetanus immune globulin [TIG], hepatitis B and hepatitis B immunoglobulin [HBIG]), separate anatomic sites (i.e., different limbs) should be used for each injection. Visit [ACIP](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/administration.html) for more information - Question A vaccination was not refrigerated, can it still be administered? - Answer - As a general rule, vaccines that have been stored at inappropriate temperatures should not be administered unless public health authorities or the manufacturer determine it is safe and effective to do so. If such vaccines already have been administered, vaccine exposed to inappropriate temperatures that is inadvertently administered should generally be repeated. Clinicians should consult promptly with state or local health departments in these situations.

If a dose of expired inactivated vaccine is given by accident to a patient, the dose should be repeated with viable vaccine. The repeat dose can be given on the same day or at any time after the date of the expired dose. If a dose of expired live virus is given, you must wait at least 28 days after the expired dose was administered before repeating it. - Question Is an active CPR certification required to administer vaccinations? - Answer - Yes. The pharmacist must hold an active CPR certification issued by the American Heart Association or the American Red Cross or any other equivalent program intended for a healthcare provider that contains a hands-on training component and is valid for not more than three years, and documentation of the certification is placed on file in the "}
