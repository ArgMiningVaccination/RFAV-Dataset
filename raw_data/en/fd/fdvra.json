Stevenson has appeared on [Infowars](/wiki/Infowars), where she alleged that [Gardasil](/wiki/Gardasil) was dangerous, [[1]](#cite_note-1) [[2]](#cite_note-jonesin-2) and has also contributed to [GreenMedInfo](/wiki/GreenMedInfo).

[[6]](#cite_note-6) [[7]](#cite_note-7) reader to be [open minded](/wiki/Open_mind) to its bullshit: [[8]](#cite_note-8) The hope of Gaia Health is to clear the mist from our eyes. It has always been human nature to question, research, and think\u2014to be a rebel and even outcast. Gaia Health echoes those propensities. We hope that you'll look through the pages and read articles with an open mind. You'll likely be surprised, shocked, amazed, and stunned at some of the information. Some will likely be contrary to what you've believed. That's the idea\u2014to challenge accepted views of the world, but only with facts and reason. Quack Miranda Warning[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Gaia_Health&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] [Quack Miranda Warning](/wiki/Quack_Miranda_Warning) [Green ink](/wiki/Green_ink) Some time after the death of Stevenson, the site added a [Quack Miranda Warning](/wiki/Quack_Miranda_Warning). It claims that their \"articles are well researched and sources are provided\", which is laughable given the shoddy quality of their articles: [[9]](#cite_note-main-9) Gaia Health [offers a different take on health]. Although our articles are well researched and sources are provided, we accept no responsibility, including for the efficacy of the information or how the information may be used. In addition, the opinions expressed in articles on this site are solely those of the authors, and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the owner(s) of this website. Please consult your doctor as your primary source of health information. So, even though the site often has information contrary to good medical advice (e.g., [homeopathy](/wiki/Homeopathy) and [antivax](/wiki/Antivax)), the site still recommends that you consult your doctor for primary information. Subcategories[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Gaia_Health&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] The site also gives the impression of being far more comprehensive than it is with a long list of subcategories. However, as of November 16, 2017, thirteen of their categories are empty including most of the disease category, including topics such as [drug](/wiki/Drug) resistant [bacteria](/wiki/Bacteria) and [childbirth](/wiki/Childbirth). The site also included a humor section allegedly filled with \"funny\" anti-medicine and anti-chemical articles and videos. [[10]](#cite_note-10) Gaia Health leans heavily on [Big Pharma](/wiki/Big_Pharma) conspiracy theories. It opposes government regulation of alternative medicine, at one point expressing outrage at the banning of Hyland's Homeopathic Teething Tablets (which were found to have unsafe levels of belladonna), claiming the [FDA](/wiki/FDA) was a servant of Big Pharma and that it was an assault on [health freedom](/wiki/Health_freedom). [[11]](#cite_note-11) (The idea that large pharmaceutical companies, in actuality, hate FDA regulation never occurred to them.) Stevenson lacks a basic knowledge of [hypothesis](/wiki/Hypothesis) testing and epidemiology, yet she felt qualified to criticize the very basis of a vaccine-autism epidemiology study. [[12]](#cite_note-12) [[13]](#cite_note-13) Homeopathy[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Gaia_Health&action=edit\u00a7ion=6)] Against homeopathy regulation[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Gaia_Health&action=edit\u00a7ion=7)] In an article titled \"Should We Regulate Water Like Alcohol Because They're Both Liquids?\" Gaia Health pushes against homeopathy regulation in the UK by comparing alcohol regulation to water: [[14]](#cite_note-14) Homeopathic remedies are on the verge of being regulated in the same manner as pharmaceuticals in the UK. The reason being used is that they're both medicines, so they should both be treated in the same manner. Regulating homeopathic remedies like pharmaceuticals because they're both medicines would be like regulating water the same way as alcohol, since they're both liquids. Placebo effect[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Gaia_Health&action=edit\u00a7ion=8)] As a homeopath, Stevenson has also attempt to refute the existence of the [placebo effect](/wiki/Placebo_effect). [[15]](#cite_note-busting-15) [[16]](#cite_note-myth-16) [[15]](#cite_note-busting-15) However, it is well-established that placebos do have real and measurable effects, which are [psychosomatic](/wiki/Psychosomatic) nature.
