Most people who have spine surgery have had pain for some time and non -surgical treatments, such as medicines and exercises, have not helped with the pain. The goa l of spine surgery is to help you with pain and movement so you can once again do the things that are important to you. Although pain treatments may not take away all of your pain, many people are able to lower their pain enough to function better and enjo y life. After surgery, it will take time for you to improve. It may take weeks or even months to feel better than you did before surgery. To help manage your pain during recovery, you will use both pain medicine and non -drug techniques. This guide will he lp you learn about both methods. Some strong prescription pain medicines, called narcotics, may make the pain better at first, but they can actually make pain worse and create serious problems if used incorrectly or for a long time. Non -drug pain relief methods do not cause serious problems that narcotics can cause. Many non-drug methods work better with time and practice. In time, you may be able to manage your pain using non -drug methods with little or no medicine at all. We encourage you to use this guide to learn about using pain medicine safely. We hope that you will try several of the non -drug pain relief methods introduced in this guide. Practice some every day before your surgery to help you get good at them. Then continue using them after surger y. We at the Spine Center want to work with you to find the best ways to help relieve your pain.

Pain relief is an important part of your treatment. This will help you feel more comfortable, move around sooner and heal faster. There are many ways to treat pain. We will help you come up with a pain treatment plan that works f or you.

We may need to change your pain plan. Many people find setting a small goal each day, really helps them gain the momentum needed to accomplish their ultimate goals. Some people set unrealistically high or vague goals that can never be fully achieved. Thus \"SMART\" goals (Specific, Measurable, A chievable, Realistic and Time - bound) are important to track your progress, while guiding future goals and activities. An example of a SMART goal is: \"I want to have lunch with my two best friends in 3 months without being limited by pain.\" Read more 6 Medicine used for treating pain after surgery The most common way to treat pain is with pain medicine. Each type of pain medicine has benefits and risks. What takes away your pain might not work or be safe for someone else. We will work with you to find the safest, helpful regimen to treat your pain. It is important to take your pain medicine exactly as you are told. Depending on how well you are doing with your recovery, we may suggest that you take your medicine in different ways such as : on a set schedule to keep steady levels in your system, before starting an activity (like physical therapy), or only if needed when pain in not relieved by other methods Common over -the-counter and prescription pain medicine include: Over -the-counter pain medicines Acetaminophen (Tylenol, Panadol) : is a typ e of medicine that helps with fever, headaches, minor aches and pains. It can also help strong er pain medicines work better. Don't take more than 4,000mg per day. Ask your professional to help you figure out which medicines you take that contain acetaminop hen so you don't get too much. NSAIDs (NonSteroidal Anti -Inflammatory Drugs like Aleve/Advil): help with fever, pain, and swelling. NSAIDs are safe for most people when taken daily for a week or two. Check with your doctor before taking NSAIDs, as they may cause risks during surgery or interfere with healing afterwards. NSAIDs are generally avoided in those with certain health problems and after some types of fusion surgery. 7 Medicine used for treating pain after surgery Prescription pain medicines Neuropathic pain medicines (Lyrica, Neurontin, Cymbalta, etc): help with muscle and nerve pain. Often they work best after a few weeks of daily use, but sometimes are used briefly just before and after surgery to help limit the dose of narcotics needed. Narcotic pain medicines (Dilaudid, Percocet, Vicodin, etc): are stronger pain medicines that work well to lessen severe pain. Many people take some narcotic pain medicine after spine surgery. They do not take pain completely away, but can make it manageab le. If you have been taking narcotics before surgery, the amount you take over time is lowered slowly. Follow the plan to do this safely. Tips on using narcotics safely Narcotics are safe and work well for pain if you take them as you were told. However, side effects, accidents, addiction, or death by overdose can happen especially if they are taken incorrectly. Follow the tips below on how to safely use, store, and dispose narcotics. They can help prevent harm to yourself and others.

Rules for filling narcotic prescriptions If you will need narcotic pain medicine for more than 7 days, there are state laws and hospital policies to follow, including: Your first prescription may be limited to a 7 -day supply, You must show a photo ID when you pick the medicine up, Call your prescriber's office 2 days before you need a refill The pharmacist can dispense fewer than prescribed pills if you think too many are ordered 8 What helps in addition to meds after surgery? Standards of medical care, guided by research, now show that medicine used to control pain have a short -term benefit, but lose effectiveness and cause harm when used for long periods or in high doses. There are many safer , non-drug methods that people use alone, o r in combination with medicine. You and your team will work together to find the best combination to manage your pain, restore your activity levels and avoid the harms of ongoing or high dose medicine. Following surgery, pain coping methods target ing both the body and the mind should be combined to best control your pain and improve your recovery. Pain coping methods that target the body include: Careful selection, use and monitoring of pain medicines Safely cooling (and later heating) the painful area Activity as guided by Physical Therapy and your team o No bending, arching your back, twisting, or lifting o Avoid prolonged sitting o Frequent short walks, and slow, gentle movements Positioning for comfort and frequent repositioning Good nutrition, fresh air, and adequate sleep 9 Coping with thoughts & feelings that affect pain Pain is a uniquely individual experience, affecting people at a personal level. In addition to the medicine and non -drug methods d escribed, coping with unhelpful thoughts and feelings also help control pain. \\ Know what to expect during your recovery Remain cautiously optimistic about your recovery o Being overly optimistic may result in trying too much, too soon, that may result in set -backs o Being overly pessimistic increases pain and strong emotions, or can instill a sense of helplessness. Relaxation, and stress reduction techniques help o Recovering from surgery and pain is stressful Taking your mind off your pain with music, books, puzzles, TV or pleasant conversations can help you cope. Let go of strong emotions and upsetting thoughts The company of others, prayer or meditation can help. 10 Specific n on-drug pain relief after surgery We want you to try non -drug ways that help with pain in addition to your prescribed medicine. Check with us before using these methods, because sometimes, we may want you to delay their use, depending on your specific surgery. Let us know if you try one of these methods and it makes you feel worse instead of better. Physical methods work in different ways to help lower pain. Some directly treat the area where you feel pain. Others send painless signals to the brain to fight off pain signals . Cooling or he ating the painful area Use heat or cold, whichever makes you feel better. Cold is better than heat the first few days after surgery. Cold slows down blood flow to the painful area and reduces swelling and muscle spasms. Heat increases blood flow to the pai nful area to help with muscle spasms and pain. Read more ... Body positioning and movement Right after surgery, keeping the bac k in straight position that fol lows its natural curves is best. P illows will help you find a com fortable position with less stress on your back. Bending, twisting, lifting or arching your back is prohibited at first. You will be taught to \"log roll\" in bed, and a way to sit, and stand up without straining yo ur back. The best exercise in the days and weeks after surgery is walking. Then, body mechanics will be taught to protect and strengthen your back as you become more active. Sitting or staying still for more than 30 -40 m inutes can cause pain and stiff ness , so keep moving as instructed! 11 Non-drug back pain relief: mind-body methods Pain is an unpleasant bodily and emotional experience. The mind -body connection is clear as for most people, the stronger the pain, the more upset they become. It is also true that strong emoti ons, or upsetting thoughts make pain worse. The opposite is also true: your mind can have a positive effect on pain. Having a positive outlook might help you handle pain or stress better, making it less bothersome. Mind -body pain relief methods take advantage of this positive effect. Distraction Distraction can help with pain by having your mind focus on something other than your pain. Try doing something that you enjoy or find relaxing. Activities that work for some people include: watching TV, listening to music, reading or listening to a bo ok, playing a game, doing a puzzle or even counting. Distraction works as long as it holds your attention & takes your mind off of the pain. It is a good method to try if it is too soon to take your pain pill or if your pain lasts only a few minutes. Use the method you like best. 12 Relaxation & meditation techniques Relaxation and meditation techniques help to reduce pain and its negative effects on the mind and body. Long term pain can cause changes in your brain. Relaxation and meditation may help reverse these changes. Relaxation techniques can be as simple as focusing on your breathing, relaxing your jaw or relaxing different muscle groups. Imagery, hypnosis and meditation methods use focused attention and mental images to help calm and relax you. These methods help reduce stress, but to relieve pain, they work best after a period of daily practice. Start doing them before surgery and continue at least daily after surgery. Start practicing by using one of the following methods at least once a day: Relaxi ng with Ocean Sounds Become Relaxed in a Safe Place 13 Wellness despite pain: getting stronger everyday Wellness -oriented methods that help people with pain include: Better Sleep Patterns Pain often interrupts sleep.
