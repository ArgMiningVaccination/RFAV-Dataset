It's no surprise that the general population is unwell many times throughout the year. Office workers are trading their vacation days for sick days! Have you ever heard of an immunity pattern? Chances are that most of them, before coming down with a cold or flu, have experienced high levels of stress by operating at full-speed, or have been putting a lot of pressure on their spine by working long hours at the office. What [scientific studies](https://www.apa.org/research/action/immune) have highlighted so far is that heightened stress levels and lack of sleep can gravely affect our immune response, leaving us more susceptible both emotionally and physically. One other important aspect that the data has shown is that many viruses and bacteria quietly reside within us, until something within the body's internal environment becomes unbalanced. If you are at least a little bit familiar with what chiropractors do, you probably know by now that chiropractic care is much more than a fast solution to neck and back pain. By focusing on the human body as a whole, regular chiropractic care and adjustments encourage spinal alignment and restore joint function, therefore supporting the nervous system. As a result of improved function and mobility in your spine and body, and thanks to a healthy blood flow, you can actually boost your immune system no matter your age, or what diseases you suffer from. If you want to discover more about how natural care practices and chiropractic adjustments can help restore your immune system with the benefits of physiological stress relief, stick with us till the end. We'll get more in depth shortly. But first, we want to talk about your immune system. Before seeing how does chiropractic care boost the immune system, let's first have a look at how our immune system functions to keep us healthy. Made up of various organs, cells and proteins, [the immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279364/) has a vital role in keeping us not only healthy, but also alive. Throughout our entire life, it keeps our bodies safe from harmful substances, viruses, germs or cell changes that could make us ill. A weakened immune system leads to what medical doctors refer to as [immunodeficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency#:~:text=Immunodeficiency%2C%20also%20known%20as%20immunocompromisation,affect%20the%20patient's%20immune%20system.). Immunodeficiency is a state in which the immune system's ability to fight infectious diseases or cancer is compromised, or entirely absent, and it usually appears when the body stops producing enough immune cells, or those cells do not function properly. The causes that lead to this condition can be either primary (genetic), or secondary, like: Medications like steroids, chemotherapy drugs, or drugs Medical conditions Infections like AIDS or mononucleosis Stress, lack of sleep, exhaustion So how does one begin an immune system-boosting chiropractic care program that can lead to fast results? As many studies can attest, chiropractic adjustments provide gentle, natural means of supporting the immune system on a constant basis, no matter how hectic your schedule might be. Chiropractic helps lower stress hormones that compromise the immune system, while also improving function and mobility in your spine and body. By stimulating the lymphatic system to oust toxins from the body and by bringing oxygenated blood to the various organs, it ensures optimal function.
