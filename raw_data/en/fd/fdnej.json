It strengthens an under-active immune system, and at the same time, turn off an overactive immune system. By enhancing only the function of the TH-1 cells and not the TH-2 helper cells, phytosterols/sterolins may provide that crucial balance. Helper cells are divided into two types: Type TH-1 and Type TH-2. These cells must remain in a delicate balance at all times for the body to remain healthy. TH-1 cells control the TH-2 (Type 2 helper) cells, which can over stimulate B-cell activity. Too many B-cells (or antibodies) can cause an autoimmune reaction. Uncontrolled over activity of B-cells is thought to be responsible for debilitating or chronic autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, allergies, and asthma. Phyto-Immun is indicated for these conditions, as well as for the treatment of gastric ulcers, high cholesterol, chronic inflammation and benign protate hypertrophy (BPH). Research has shown that a mixture of sterols and sterolins in a ratio of approximately 80:1 is more effective than either sterol alone. Super Immune PlusTM\u2014 helps to enhance immune system function by activating a number of pathways with a synergistic combination of ingredients. It also contains restorative herbs to help build back the body's normal energy. "}
