We are at a critical moment in our fight against COVID -19 and the KP Los Angeles Medical Center is committed to doing everything we can to keep you, our members, and our communities as safe as possible. We have implemented the following preoperative guidelines for our patients: Testing All members who are scheduled for procedures or surgeries are required to complete COVID -19 testing three days before their surgery date. Your surgeon will order a COVID -19 test for you, and a team member will contact you before your surgery with information on how to get tested at the Kaiser Permanente facility of your choice. You will also be called several days before your procedure so we can screen you f or COVID -19 symptoms and again upon your arrival. Visitor Policy Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, no visitors are allowed to accompany a patient into the preoperative preparation area before surgery or postoperative recovery area. The exceptions to that are visitors of pediatrics patients or patients with physical or cognitive impairment. Depending on the unit, limited visitation may be allowed. Please check with the hospital unit where the patient will be admitted after the surgery. Anyone 14 or younger, who is not a patient, may not visit patients at this time. We also ask that visitors not enter the hospital if they have a cough, cold, fever, or are sick. All patients and visitors will have their temperature checked upon arrival to the hospital. Masks are Required for All Who Enter To protect the health and safety of our members, patients, staff, physicians and visitors, masks are required at all Kaiser Permanente facilities. That means adults and children over the age of 2 entering a Kaiser Permanente facility must wear a mask during their visit. If you do not have a mask, we are happy to provide one for you to wear. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work diligently to protect you, all of our patients, and our staff in order to reduce the spread of COVID -19 in our communities. kp.org/coronavirus Los Angeles Medical Center SCHEDULE & APPOINTMENT TIMES CHECKLIST Please bring this folder to all your pre -surgery/procedure appointments This page is for you to write down all your appointments.

Take the pain medicine as instructed by your doctor. If You Are to Stay in the Hospital After Your Surgery Ask for Pain Medicine When Pain Begins Take action as soon as the pain starts. It is harder to ease pain once it has taken hold. This is a key step in pain control. If you know your pain will worsen when you start walking or doing breathing exercises, take your medicine first. Persistent Pain Tell your doctor or nurse about pain that does not go away after medicine is given. Don't hesitate to speak up about y our pain! The doctors and nurses want and need to know about it. Measuring Pain - Adults The doctors and nurses may ask you to rate your pain on a scale of 0 -10. Reporting your pain as a number helps the doctors and nurses know how well your treatment is working and whether to make any changes. Pain Management - CHILD If Your Child Will Be Staying in the Hospital After Surgery Los Angeles Medical Center AFTER SURGERY Pain Experience Pain can be hard for a child to describe. It is expressed and experienced differently among age groups, cultures, and genders. An older child may be able to describe how the pain feels or tell you whether the pain comes and goes. While a toddler may say he or she is not feeling well. When someone is experiencing a great deal of pain it may be possible to control and reduce the pain to an acceptable level. However, it may be possible to eliminate the pain completely. What Might Pain Look Like in Your Child? Changes in usual behavior; your child may eat le ss, become fussy or restless, and have less interaction and talking with others. Inconsolable crying, grunting, or breath holding. Facial expressions; such as furrowed brow, a wrinkled forehead, closed eyes, or an angry appearance. Sleep changes; such as waking often or sleeping more or less than usual. Even children in severe pain may take short naps because they are so tired. Body movements; such as making fists, protecting a part of the body (especially while walking), kicking, or clinging to whoever ho lds him or her, or not moving. Acceptable Level of Pain When your nurse or other members of the health care team asks what your child's \"acceptable level of pain\", they are trying to determine at what point your child would like to start receiving pain med icines, because different medicines are designed to treat different levels of pain. Reporting Pain and Discomfort When your child is experiencing pain, it is important to let your health care provider know right away. It is more effective to give pain medi cines sooner, rather than waiting until the pain is severe and unbearable. Los Angeles Medical Center AFTER SURGERY Pain Management - CHILD How Do We Measure Pain? In addition to words your child may use to describe their pain, we also look at vital signs (heart rate, breathing rate, etc.) and bodily expressions. We use three pain scales: 1) Wong -Baker FACES Pain Scale (see image below) 2) Numeric Pain Scale (0 -10) 3) \"FLACC\" Pain Scale For younger patients who are unable to speak or are unable to relate pain intensity to numbers; the FACES scale is a suitable choice. The doctors and nurses may ask your child to rate their pain on a scale of 0 -10. (image below) Reporting pain as a number helps the doctors and nurses know how well their treatment is working and whether to make any changes. Wong -Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale 0 No Hurt 2 Hurts Little Bit 4 Hurts Little More 6 Hurts Even More 8 Hurts Whole Lot 10 Hurts Worst \u00a91983 Wong -Baker FACES Foundation. Used with permission. How Do We Reduce Your Child's Pain? We encourage all caregivers to be involved in addressing their loved one's pain. We understand that pain is not just physical and have a team dedicated to addressing your needs here in the hospital; Child Life Specialists, Medical Social Workers, Nurses Physicians, Chaplains, and volunteer groups. We take the \"3Ps\" approach (Physical, Psychological, and Pharmacological) in ensuring that your child's comfort level is met. Remember?
