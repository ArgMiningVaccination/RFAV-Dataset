Invariably we would meet; sometimes , multi - hour interviews were requested. Months would go by until eventually the author s would come back to me explaining that they could not get their mind around the incredible work we were doing. The implications were too vast, the outcomes too extraordinary. The genre had much ancient history; and too much of mankind's future at stake for them to be able to create any meaningful composition. The idea that sounds, without accompanying music, have potential to be an efficient healing modality was more than they could comprehe nd. The concept that frequency coul d have created our universe and could be used to allow domini on over our biology and our DNA was a notion far afield from their reality. I was far less than cautiously hopeful when Jill Mattson approached me to write a book about our work with sound and fr equency -based biomarkers. I had read Jill's previous book about healing and knew that she had a depth of knowledge about the history of ancient sound. We met to discuss some ideas but I had little faith that anything would ever come from our exchange. I was astonished, shortly thereafter, when Jill delivered a 400 page manuscript that encomp assed my early life and history. It included a narrative of the initial development of the processes of Vocal Profiling right through to our most advanced data and str ategies dealing with the effects of sound on human physiology and psychology. I was overwhelmed with appreciation that finally someone understood our efforts. Jill understood our work from an outsider's perspective, and as well as any insider who had bee n working with us for the last twenty years. I was stunned at how she had originally woven all of our information into a compelling story abo ut future medicine while simultaneously lacing it with ancient mystery school philosophies. Jill, as an amateur w riter, has brought together a unique awareness of Human BioAcoustic s that professional s could not manage. Perhaps , it 2 is her perspective as a violin performance aficionado that provides her with such an uninhibited view of what it takes to allow the soul t o perceive sound as both pleasure and wellness. Now through Jill's publication about our work with BioAcoustic Biology, the rest of the world may benefit from what we have known for the past few decades. Sharry Edwards 3 Getting started: A little bit about the book I first met Sharry Edwards in the fall of 2008 in Columbus, Ohio. She was soft -spoken and reserved, but the power of her presence and the feeling of quiet strength she radiated immediately struck me. I knew of Sharry's reputation from my years of study on the healing ability of sound. After meeting Sharry in person, I immediately wanted to include a chapter on her in an upcoming book. But after I b egan to digest the wealth of information I uncovered during my research, it became clear I could write several books on her alone. Si nce the realities in my life do not permit me the time for several books, I tried to condense the information into this one . This book is organized into three parts. The book can be read cover to cover in the order it is presented, however that ma y not be for everyone. Part One: Sharry's Story, is aimed at the general reader. This section gives a brief biography of Sharry and presents her basic work and accomplishments in a nontechnical presentation. We see important events that affected her early development and the founda tions of BioAcoustics. Part Two: Technical Details, continues where Part One left off but contains more c hallenging technical content . This part of the book can be read selectively depending upon the reader's background and interest level (It could be a reference source for more advanced sound enthusiasts). Finally, Part Three : Applications, focuses on how on e can learn more about Sharry's pioneering work and start to apply her methods. Here I explore free beneficial applications of using sound in your voice that fit compatibly with Sharry's teachings. This section is intended for those interested in immediate ly starting with their own explorations of the benefits of BioAcoustics,1 and better health through sound. Finally, I want to thank Sharry and her gracious colleagues, workers, family and friends for their time, openness and indispensable help in writing this book. Special thanks also go to Steven Flinchbaugh, 1 BioAcoustics is the spelling that Sharry uses to describe her knowledge related to the life sounds of humans. In contrast, bioacoustics refers to the life sounds of animals. 4 Rebecca Gonzalez , Robert Schrichte, Barbara Sch roeder, Neil Flinchbaugh , Jesse Near and Vamshi Krishna. \u00a9 20 11 by Wings of Light Oil City, PA 16301 Second printing 2011 Disclaimer Please know that this book is not intended to serve as medical advice or to make any recommendations or prescriptions for medical treatment.

These extraordinary people, at the most basic level, saw the world differently than anyone before them. True genius is rare. Through their insights and their lives they changed the world forever. In similar fashion, Sharry Edwards is currently making u nparalleled insights into the nature of healing and the role of sound to accomplish near miraculous results. Sharry is making contributions in this world that will have lasting, beneficial impacts on mankind. It has been my privilege to speak at length wi th Sharry and to learn firsthand about her groundbreaking achievements and the new science she is exploring, time for which I am deeply grateful. Her vision, dedication and desire to learn more about the powerful sounds contained in our voices inspire me. I appreciate her willingness to share her gifts and ideas; this has expanded my thinking to consider a bigger reality than the one that I see and hear with only my eyes and ears. Sharry is the recognized leader in the emerging field of human BioAcoustics , literally meaning life sounds. This field encompasses the study of sound and its eff ects on living organisms. She pioneered sound -based therapies for health care professionals and created self- discovery tools with astounding results. Sharry received th e New Scientist of the Year Award from the International Association of New Science in 2001 and was also a recipient of the prestigious O. Spurgeon English Humanitarian Award from the city of Philadelphia at Temple University in 2002. Sharry devised a Voc al Profiling system based on the analysis of patterns hidden within the tones of a person's voice. Our brain combines thousands of different frequencies to create our speaking voice with the net result that we perceive the human voice as one soundtrack. Fast Fourier Transformers graph the frequencies and volume of the voice . These graphs reflect complicated frequency 8 interactions within the body, yielding simple and unique shapes. Sharry calls the resulting characteristic shapes the voice's architecture. This voice architecture holds critical information abo ut the speaker. When we are ill individual pitches in our voice stretch outside of our normal architecture. The nature of these anomalous frequencies holds important clues to the underlying causes. So much information can be found within our voices, a holographic representation of ourselves. Sharry read s and interpret s vocal codes. Balancing tones harmonize the stressed frequencies, returning them to healthy coherence , producing tangible improve ments to our well -being. These discoveries rock our belief systems regarding health and wellness. Sharry has often shown remarkable results in helping people who have exhausted conventional remedies. She has established a new approach that offers exciting information and hope for people with a wide array of health issues. Sharry's methods have shown many documented results, and much of this book attempts to explain her theories and observations and encourage others to conduct research to explore and verif y them. My objectives include discussing elemental principals of how the body uses frequencies, vibrations and math ematics , and to present some applications of musical principals within the body's daily operations. I relate Sharry's profound discoveries to other modalities such as color healing and astrology, and conclude by suggest ing new creative applications for using Sharry's profound discoveries for wellness and deep personal transformation. 9 PART ONE SHARRY'S STORY Chapter One How it B egan I got up extra early on a cold Saturday morning and dressed quickly. That in itself is quite an event - I normally hate getting out of bed. The reason for my uncharacteristic behavior was excitement over what I had learned during a recent visit to so utheast Ohio. I had just returned home after a few days spent at Sharry Edwards' Sound Health facility in Albany, Ohio. At Sharry's special invitation, I attended the opening portion of her week -long introductory training course. I enjoyed a few hours of one-on-one time with Sharry to better get to know her and to ask intimate questions on her work and her life. The new opportunities to learn about the power of sound to heal the human body, mind and spirit and the power of Sharry Edwards' personality and p resence had me floating . My mind was buzzing. Upon arriving home late from Sharry's offices, I had learned so many new concepts that my thoughts were overflowing like a flooded stream. I sat down at my computer in my loft office and I worked furiously for over two hours. About this time, my bored German shorthair tried to climb into my lap. This may seem like an innocent matter to dog lovers - but Danke weighs over 90 pounds. She wanted attention and she wanted to go outside - NOW. I took my coat and my n otebook to the backyard with the dog. After the mandatory short walk , I settled into my usual spot next to a grand old oak tree. Back to work. 10 Sharry is discovering things about sound and healing that seem miraculous. She is practicing a new science! I wo ndered how she ever got so far. Pondering on Sharry's work, I slumped back, leaning against the tree. My vision blurred and I drifted into a state of deep relaxation - like falling asleep . In my mind's eye I perceived a giant, clear, rubbery bubble. Next thing, I was floating inside the bubble. It was like being inside a dream. I felt safe, secure, loved and cherished. I never wanted to wake up or leave that bubble. The bubble transported me up into the sky - my own magic carpet , but more like a magic balloon. I found I could go wherever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I traveled into the past and hovered in front of a humble farmhouse where I spied Sharry Edwards as a young child, living in a pristine Appalachian setting. I could look into Sharry's being from my bubble perch. She was born with extraordinary gifts, particularly her hearing. As I got closer I saw that it was not a farmhouse but a n out building that looked like a corncrib . A corncrib has spaces in between the boards to let the corn breathe. Sharry's family had lined the siding slots with cardboard to protect themselves from the elements. The outbuilding where Sharry lived as a young child 11 The bubble glistened as it turned and I saw Sharry as a child of about three. In the front of the corn crib, there were little steps and a few boards were aligned to create a loft. The only window in the corn crib was in the front , near the loft. This was where Sharry and her brother slept. Boards were attached to the walls and served as shelves for canned g oods. Sharry's mother used old cotton feedbags as curtains in front of these shelves. I saw little Sharry pull aside the curtain to get something to eat. Coming eye to eye with a large snake which must have been looking for food , she let out a huge scream! Sharry's environment was not contaminated with electromagnetic radiation and frequencies that are prevalent in the air today. The s pace was more acoustically pure without TVs, m icrowaves, cell phones, electronics , radio and computer energies. It is specu lated that t his setting contributed to Sharry's remarkable hearing abilities. It was clear Sharry's family thrived on this farm eating only fresh, natural whole foods - without toxins and food additives tainting their bodies. My bubble moved me ahead in t ime to a deep stream on the same farm. I glimpsed a five -year-old Sharry lying on the ground, soaking wet and exhausted. I somehow knew that she had almost drowned in that nearby creek. I have heard documented reports of people spontaneously acquiring extr aordinary abilities or senses after experiencing a near -death encounter. This event greatly enhanced Sharry's already remarkable hearing abilities. After this incident she began to hear many extrasensory sounds - from unusual sources - that most do not h ear. Human ears have a nearly dormant mechanism called the sacculus.2 This organ was used in our evolutionary past. The sacculus is a sonar - sensing device that is highly developed in dolphins, but humans do not use it in this manner. We use the sacculus t o help our equilibrium and to tell us which way is up or down when underwater. Sharry's sacculus was affected by the near drowning experience and she gained sonar -like sensing capabilities to complement her acute 2 The saccule is a bed of sensory cells situated in the inner ear. The sacc ule translates head movements into neural impulses, which the brain can interpret. The saccule is sensitive to movements of up and down (think about moving on an elevator). When the head moves vertically, the sensory cells of the saccule are disturbed and the neurons connected to them begin transmitting impulses to the brain. The vestibular system, which includes the saccule, is important in maintaining balance , or equilibrium . http://en.wikipedi a.org/wiki/Saccule 12 hearing. Sharry did pay the price of having her sense of equilibrium distorted with the changes. Dolphins have highly evolved sonar -sensing capabilities. They transmit sonar waves, which reflect off of objects in their path. They can interpret the returned waves just as a ship's sonar does. This g ives them another sense, another window -on-the-world to receive additional information. Dolphins also have an extraordinary hearing range compared to humans. While the average adult hears sounds that vibrate at 20 cycles per second to about 20,000 cycles per second, dolphins hear and utilize sounds that vibrate up to 180,000 cycles per second. They hear and understand more frequencies than we do. These mammals can also voice numerous complex and haunting sounds that can travel impressive distances underwa ter. It is interesting that Sharry shares many of the remarkable abilities to use sound similar to a dolphin. My clear bubble rolled forward in time and I observed a young Sharry, who now lived with her family in a small farmhouse. She regularly heard unusual sounds emanating from her grandmother, who had diabetes. When her aunt started emitting the same sounds, Sharry told the aunt that she might have diabetes. When the aunt heard this, she yelled at Sharry, calling her a little witch. What a disturbing event for a young girl. Perhaps the aunt felt that her privacy was invaded or did not want to hear such a diagnosis. Later the aun t tested positive for diabetes. As a child, Sharry believed everyone heard things as she did. I observed Sharry repeating wh at one of her aunts had said. The aunt replied that she did not say what Sharry attributed to her. She only thought the comment. Rather than marvel at this, the aunt brand ed Sharry's perceptions as something paranormal. The event would be confusing on its own, but add in the negative reaction from family and difficulties in Sharry's childhood become apparent. I witnessed a young Sharry becoming r eticent to share what she heard to avoid painful situations of being singled out for her hearing abilities. It w as as if she tried to ignore her gift so that she would fit in with others and be more normal. 13 I understood that Sharry had many painful moments, because she was different. At an early age she did not understand that she possessed a beautiful gift. Aft er all, many people distance themselves from those who are different. When Sharry was still quite young , she play ed in the woods with her cousin. The two little girls found a shiny tall tube with a pattern of three interlocking triangles on its side . Sharry and her cousin had never seen anything like this . The event influenced Sharry and she believed it helped shape her outlook on life. The symbol retained special meaning throughout her life and now serves as a logo that grace CD covers and booklets for her company. Sharry had the shape of the three triangles made into a sculpture. From one view , it resembles the three interlocking triangles which create a tiny triangle in the middle . From another view it resembles this picture which has likeness to the Templar cross. Sharry now uses this design in one of her logos, see below. The shadow of the replica of the design that Sharry found Although there were many painful moments in Sharry's childhood, several people foreshadowed the contributions that Sharr y would make to the human race. A palm reader noted a shape of a beehive on Sharry's palm, relaying that this meant she had extraordinary musical ability and would heal others with her voice. Sharry sent a postcard to Ruth Montgomery, an intuitive, prophet and author. She asked her a 14 question regarding a book that Ruth had published. Ruth wrote back and referenced the cigar shaped object with the three triangles that the girls had found in the woods and the unique energy that came from it. The object did have a cigar shape, but Sharry had not shared that information with her. Ruth's mention of the shiny object found in the woods shook Sharry up and scared her. Ruth explained that Sharry's life's purpose was to use sound to heal people. These fortune -tellin g incidents confirmed what Sharry already knew deep down - for better or worse, she possessed abilities far exceeding those possessed by the average person. To accept our differences as gifts and pursue the understanding and perfection of them amidst innu merable obstacles is the test of true character. Sharry had many such tests, each making her grow stronger and ever more resolved in her purpose. Sharry's remarkable hearing abilities proved to be the catalyst for her lifelong journey of sound healing dis coveries. With her unique hearing abilities she has identified common sounds that signal physical maladies. She also hears thoughts, emotions and even information from people's subconscious minds. Sharry hears sounds coming from both living and inanimate o bjects. She sometimes hears tones from the ground, rocks, trees and plants, shapes, medicines and more. She uses this information to come up with unconventional conclusions holding an astonishing number of varied uses. Giving voice to the sounds she hears , Sharry produces tones to affect blood pressure, eliminate headaches, scramble recorded information on tapes, affect the preservation of foods and endless diverse and amazing applications. From my bubble, I wondered what the special sounds that Sharry produced were like. Looking down, I saw her get very still and then make a ringing sound with h er voice, like someone rubbing their finger on a crystal glass to produce a high pitch that was rich with harmonics. It was as if she heard my thought and produced my sound. The sounds that she hears are often above our hearing range. When she sings them, she is taking then down octaves into her vocal range. I had never heard a person make a sound like that before! The act of hearing plays a crucial role in develo ping our ability to speak or verbalize sounds. Deaf people struggle in learning to speak 15 mainly because they cannot hear and learn by imitation. Dr. Alfred Tomatis3 discovered that we must hear a sound in order to accurately duplicate the same sound with o ur voices. Not surprisingly, Sharry hears sounds that are beyond the abilities of other people and she can similarly voice sounds that others cannot. I watched while Sharry continued to make my sound. She can hear the pitch as well as the rhythm of the sound. Next she drew a picture on a piece of paper - she was drawing my sound. The drawing looked like the edge of a circular saw blade. The notches in the saw represented the periodic changes in volume, representing the rhythm. Often sounds have a periodi c rhythm pattern. I wondered about the mystery of what this shape , rhythm and sound meant. I wished that I could have been given this gift like Sharry had. She deciphered many mysteries from the unique sounds that only she heard. With this information she created a seemingly miraculous system to benefit people. Miracles can be science that we do not yet understand. Sharry's hearing gift presented her with opportunities to explore and uncover secrets about sound healing that are beginning to be verified by science and are what she calls the sonistry of tomorrow. In the book, The Sleeping Prophet , Edgar Casey predicted that the medicine of the future would utilize frequencies. When he made the prediction it sounded crazy, today this seems like destiny. My bubble wobbled, jarring me. The interruption caused me to drop these thoughts. I looked in on Sharry listening to the sounds emanating from trees, rocks, flowers and the ground. Sharry can even hear sounds that she perceives stemming from the side of peop le's heads, near their ears. With this magical bubble I was able to hear a rock sound as Sharry heard it. What Sharry heard was a low rumbling noise. Pythagoras called a stone 's sound frozen music. Pythagoras also heard sounds of harmonics coming from ob jects, much like the sounds that Sharry describes. I listened to Sharry whispering that 3 Dr. Alfred A. Tomatis ( 1920 -2001) was an internationally known otolaryngologist and inventor. His alternative medicine theories of hearing and listening are known as the Tomatis method. His approach began as an effort to help professional singers based on his idea that hearing is the root cause of a variety of ailments. His Listening Test and later his Electronic Ear therapy were d esigned to alleviate these problems. 16 rocks have consciousness. Perhaps consciousness makes some sort of sound and that is what she is hearing. Moving on, I saw Sharry listening to a crowd of people. Some people had screeches in their voices while others made pleasant sounds. Some of the sounds were pleasing, blending together, while others stuck out like a screeching chalk on a blackboard. The noises from a crowd are overwhelming and chaotic. There is so m uch more going on acoustically than most of us realize. I thought about the shrieks and jarring sounds that Sharry perceived coming from people. What do these discordant sounds mean? Sharry's gets information about a person's physical, mental and emotion al states from her special hearing. She can ascertain when a person is being untruthful, based only on their voice. Sharry Edwards People inevitably like the comfort of their secrets and resent another who can expose their lies. This made me think about how much I value my privacy. How much would our lives change if we knew people's thoughts, feelings and real opinions? If our lies were immediately exposed, what effect would that have on our governments? Divorce rate? The sales industry? Stock marke t exchange? Business? Many people hide self -serving interests and fears behind dishonesty. I concluded that as a population we do not 17 want complete honesty. Instead of envying Sharry's gift I felt compassion for her; having such a gift wasn't easy. Peerin g out of the bubble, I saw Sharry doing chores on the family farm and as a result she missed scho ol frequently. She was the only adopted child of this farming couple and was teased about being their son because of the heavy manual labor she performed. Fa rming requires many laborious ho urs and her parents needed help. S he was a good daughter and worked hard. I saw h er dreaming of going to college but not , believing that she would ever have the chance. My bubble moved on forward in time. She was shopping with her husband and he asked her to pick out a good grapefruit. She chose one, mentioning that it sounded good. He responded that she may not want to let everyone know that she listens to grapefruits. She had long been awar e of how unique her hearing was: her awareness that other people were not ready to accept it concerned her greatly. As this scene faded out, I saw Sharry deep in thought, her fingers danc ing at the typewriter. S he was typing a paper about tinnitus4 and becoming excited - could this con cept explain the sounds that she heard? She scheduled a hearing test at a free clinic. I moved out of that scene and into the audiologist's office. When the tests for tinnitus were normal, the audiologist asked Sharry to make sounds like the ones that she heard. When she did, he nearly collapsed. He had high blood pressure and her vocalizations drastically and quickly seemed to lower his blood pressure. This sudden change - which was brought on with her voice - caused his near lapse of consciousness. The audiologist was a martial arts student and he recalled that sounds similar to Sharry's were used by the ancient Samurai to disable their opponents. This man was beginning to understand Sharry's hearing gifts! Research results later revealed that the sound s she voiced could alter one's blood pressure as much as 30 points. A drop in blood pressure of this magnitude is significant; in fact, a sudden fall of 30 points is enough to severely disable a person. Sharry learned that not 4 Tinnitus is the perception of sound within the human ear in the absence of corresponding external sound. 18 only could she hear more than other people but, her voice could make significant changes in a key aspect of a person's physiology. After this experience Sharry began a n earnes t, thirty -year exploration of the unique sounds that she could hear and reproduce. She was destined to be a p ioneer in BioAcoustics , which is defined as a branch of science concerned with the produc tion of sound and its effects on living systems. She participated in a double blind experimental study with Ohio University's school of nursin g in a scientific investi gation that examin ed her ability to alter people's blood pressu re. The results were astounding and show ed that she possessed the ability to alter blood pressure with high statistical significance. So much so , that it made some scientists raise their eyebro ws and muse if the results were contrived. The study could not be replicated with any other person because Sharry was the only known person at that time to possess such hearing and vocal talents. Since then , sound has been shown to influence blood pressure . I watched Sharry undergo two more hearing evaluations that also validated her unique abilities. It was speculated that the cochlea in her ear was wound tighter than most , enabling her to hear sounds that others could not. In addition, she had the abilit y to voice extraordinary sounds, including a perfect sine wave. I did not know what a simple sine wave sounded like but from my bubble , I saw Sharry's audiologist explain that our voices have a complex wave structure.5 If graphed, it looks like a ragged, highly irregular shape. A sine wave in contrast looks like a t extbook picture of a sound wave - symmetrical -and absolutely perfect. Her sine wave sound reminded me of a something made by a machine. Sharry's curiosity drove her to scientifically investiga te what she perceived with her extrasensory hearing. There was no research in this area to review. Rather than start with a theory and then attempt to prove it, Sharry observed the effects of sounds and then took a causal, 5 Sine waves, when graphed by frequency over time have a curved shape. The sine wave has a pattern that repeats . All waves are made by adding up sine waves. The length of one pattern of the sine wave is called the wavelength . The wavelength is measured by the length or distance between one peak of a sine wave to the next peak. The wavelength can be found in m any other ways, too. The sine wave is important in physics because it retains it's a wave shape when added to another sine wave of the same frequency and arbitrary phase. It is the only periodic waveform that has this property. This property leads to its i mportance in Fourier analysis and makes it acoustically unique. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave . 19 trial-and-error approach to learn ing. She knew that her sounds had the ability to influence physical issues. Why did this work? What was she hearing and how did these sounds affect people? Sharry observed incredible results regarding the impact of frequencies on people. In her relentless process of answering these questions, a whole new field of healing and deeper understanding of the body was unveiled. A World of Frequencies Some thinkers have long held a fundamental model of the universe that is based on frequencies. Our world is in a state of constant oscillation at many levels. Our cells, organs, DNA, heartbeats, thoughts, feelings and environments all vibrate, creating their own waves. Dr. William Tiller, Ph.D.,6 Chairman of Stanford's Materials Science Department, conducted extens ive research to understand the vibrational signals of the body. He writes, Each atom and molecule, cell and gland in our body has a characteristic frequency at which it will both absorb and emit radiation. Each cell generates its own minute vibrational si gnals from within that must stay in resonance with every other cell for the body to remain healthy.7 James Oschman offers this explanation about the vibrations of hormones: At an atomic scale, physical contact between two molecules has less meaning tha n the way they interact energetically. As a hormone approaches the receptor, the electronic structures of both molecules begin to change. Bonds bend, twist and stretch: parts rotate and wiggle. The orientation and shape of the molecules change so that the active site of the hormone can approach the active site of the receptor. The recognition of a specific hormone by a receptor 6 Tiller, W. A. Science and Human Transformation: Subtle Energies, Intentionality and Consciousness, Walnut Creek, CA., 1997. 7 Fellow to the American Academy for the Advancement of Science, Professor Emeritus William A. Tiller, of Stanford University's Department of Materials Science, spent 34 years in academia after 9 years as an advisory physicist with the Westinghouse Research Laboratories. He has p ublished over 250 conventional scientific papers, 3 books and several patents. In parallel, for over 30 years, he has been a vocationally pursuing serious experimental and theoretical study of the field of psycho -energetics , which will very likely become a n integral part of \"tomorrow's\" physics. In this new area, he has published additional 100 scientific papers and four books. 20 depends on resonant vibratory interactions, comparable to the interactions of tuning forks. 8 Waves interact and change each other . For example, when the crests of two sound waves overlap or interfere constructively they combine into a new wave that is the sum of the heights of both waves. When the trough of one wave and the crest of another wave coincide, they combine and cancel eac h other out. Therefore, any sound wave can be affected by another sound wave. Although we do not understand all of the details of the science of sound interactions in our complex bodies, Sharry is definitely onto something significant. Using sound as her medicine, she is harnessing a great power for our advantage. Being open to a world of unimagined new ideas, Sharry learns from watching sound transform people's bodies and observing sound in her world. Sounds have the ability to prickle our skin, make o ur knees weak, increase perspiration, stimulate irregular heartbeats, create loss of bladder control or cause emotional reactions. Sounds can accelerate bones heal ing and break up kidney stones. Sounds can be used as weapons and they can influence people's brainwaves. In trained hands, sound is a powerful force. This relationship also works in reverse. Changing body chemistry creates different sounds. For example, a young man's hormonal change during puberty affects his voice, lowering his voice tones. In another example, our voice changes when we get sick. When the eye perceives vibrations of light, it conver ts these signals into electro -chemical energy. These impulses are passed to the brain where they are interpreted as visual data. When we hear sound , the frequencie s are translated into electro -chemical impulses and interpreted in another region of the brain. The same sequence of events takes place when we are exposed to aromas, tactile stimulation, emotional situations, and so on. We interpret these vibrations after they reach the appropriate area of the brain. The body does more than just interpret frequencies. Frequencies are also sent to various parts of our body via our neural network - another 8 Edwards, Sharry. Vocal Profiling for the Professional , Sound Health: Albany, Ohio, 2002. pg. M1.53. 21 body energy transport system. The importance of pr ocessing frequencies goes beyond the sensual aspects such as hearing, seeing and feeling. We incorporate our sound environment and other vibrations into our total body energy. Sharry believes this is one reason why she gets impressive results by utilizing sounds that positively influence the body. As we continue to gain greater understanding of the relationships between sound and our bodies, we can use sound as an effective alternative to expensive medicine modalities that often bring negative side effect s. Perhaps vocal analysis could be used in conjunction with conventional treatments by our medical professionals, giving them better information about what is going on within the body, but at a significantly reduced cost. There is enormous potential for th e creative applications of the power of sound, if properly harnessed. Our Fundamental Frequencies Our body has two sound receivers : our ears . They are about four to five inches apart y et, we do not hear separate sounds coming into each ear. If we d id, it would be very distracting . We hear one uniform sound when a person talks. Our brain automatically combines sounds coming into our right and left ears. Similarly, all of the pitches in our voice are combined into the one tone that we hear. Each pitch comp onent has its own volume and phase relationships with other sounds.9 Our overall fundamental frequency is more like a signature chord. 9 Davis, Dorinne. Sound Bodi es through Sound Therapy . Kalco Publishing: Landing, New Jersey, 2004. pg. 244. Some people increase their int ellectual capacities by utilizing their brain's ability to combine tones. When the brain hears a different frequency in each ear at close proximity and below 30 hertz, it averages the two frequencies so we only hear one averaged frequency, which is called a binaural beat. This is purposely done to engage both the right and left hemisphere of our brain, producing whole brain functioning, rather than operating in either right or left -brain mode. In this way, we can use the strengths of both brain hemisphere s simultaneously, a powerful mental place to operate from. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_beats 22 Using special software, Sharry can isolate and identify the pitches present in ou r voice. Through careful observation and trial-and-error testing, Sharry has been able to isolate and assign the frequencies correlated to each muscle and organ. An analogy can be made between the voice and white light. White light is the combination of all colors of light. When white light is passed through a prism, we can see the breakout of the component frequencies as the colors of the rainbow. The human voice is like a musical orchestra - all the instruments combine to produce one sound that can be beautiful and uplifting -we know that every instrument has contributed to the overall effect. The voice can even mimic the sound of an orchestra with the amazing abilities of our body's instruments . The vocal chords, the larynx, the diaphragm, the throat, the tongu e, the mouth and teeth - together play the song that is the human voice. A Sample V oiceprint The vertical axis measures energy in decibels. The horizontal axis measures frequency in hertz.10 10 The hertz (symbol: Hz) is a unit of frequency . It is defined as the number of cycles per second . It is the basic unit of frequency in the International System of Units (SI), and is used worldwide in both general -purpose and scientific contexts. Her tz can be used to measure any periodic 23 Sharrry uses many analogies to understan d the depth and complexities of information contained in our voice. She has likened our voice to an aura, which is perceived by some as only one thing although it contains many complex types and categories of information. Like our aura, our voice has diffe rent layers. T here are frequencies representing layers of brain waves as well as bioelectrical, bio - magnetic, and bio -chemical frequencies from other functions in our body. All the frequencies generated by our thoughts, emotions and bodies interact with th e vocal sys tem to create our unique voice which is literally a reflection of all that we are. Energies and frequencies in the voice reflect the effects of emotions from our past , future , negative thinking and feelings, such as guilt or worries . Another source of dissonance in our voice is created when we are untruthful. Negative emotions in our voice distort the normal frequencies which many believe can result in health issues. Dorinne Davis, author of Sound Bodies through Sound Therapy , advances this idea even further. She says that , not only do negative emotions alter other tones in our voices but the y also create vibrations of their own. Fear and negative emotions produce harmful sounds. A breakdown in the mind's vibrational energy occurs when the m ind creates its own noise or disturbances or when fear is introduced. Fear changes the mind's responses and it also affects auditory processing.11 Listening to the right pattern of frequencies can repair the dissonance that we create with our negative th inking and emotions. This can reverse the impact of negative emotions and dis -ease. It can dissipate undesirable developments, while stimulating new growth. Some parts of our bodies have universal frequencies but each person's overall combination of so unds, their voice, is unique. Our universal notes (such as the frequencies of the muscles) are combined with our own unique thoughts, actions and feelings , which have their own vibrations. There are many dazzling sounds coming from our bodies and they all interact in a unique way, creating a cellular tango - event; the most common uses for hertz are to describe radio and audio frequencies, a frequency of 1 Hz is equal to one cycle per second . 11 Davis, Dorinne. Sound Bodies through Sou nd Therapy, Kalco Publishing: Landing, New Jersey; 2004. pg. 231. 24 a complex sound matrix. Just as individual singers of a chorus create beautiful harmony, cells in our bodies and other vibrational influences can create intricate and elegant harmonies that affect each other in the dance of life. As a result, our composite frequencies are as unique as our fingerprints - our fundamental frequencies . Otoacoustic Emissions People attributed Sharry's gift as clairaudience, a spiritual gift of extraordinary hearing, but ga ve no credence to it being a measurable physical phenomenon. Sharry wanted objective, concrete knowledge regarding her extraordinary ability. Yet, she found no scientific explanations. Finally, Sharry learned a partial explanation for the sounds that she h eard in close proximity to people's heads. In 1978 Dr. David Kemp,12 who wrote Understanding Otoacoustic Emissions , reported that the ear emits sounds entitled otoacoustic emissions (OEs), which are small sounds caused by the motion of the eardrum in respo nse to vibrations deep within the cochlea. The cochlea does more than receive sound. It als o produces low intensity sounds called otoacoustic emissions. Dr. Kemp confirmed the existence of these tiny sounds when ultralow -noise microphones were developed. Sharry picks up these tiny sounds with her unaided ear. Researchers have documented that otoacoustic emission sounds are created by various mechanisms within the inner ear . These sounds are related to the amplification functi on of the cochlea , within the ear. With no external stimulation, the cochlear mechanism amplifie s and produces sound. Several lines of evidence sugges t that outer hair cells enhance cochlear sensitivity allowing frequency selectivity and act ing as the energy sources for this amplification. Another explanation is , that the sounds are produced by the cochlear outer ha ir cell s as they expand and contract. Yet, another idea suggests that increased inner cochlea fluid motion excites inner ear hair cells, which then vibrate and produce the tiny sounds.13 Some believe that healthy ears produce sounds spontaneously when internal sounds are processed and amplified.14 Hearing is an active 12 Dr. David T. Kemp . Professor of Auditory Biophysics, University College in London. 13 http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/835943 -overview 14 Kempt, David. , Otodynamics Ltd.: Herts, UK. 1997. pg. 3. 25 process - the ear actually puts energy into the incoming sound waves to replace energy lost as sound is absorbed by the ear's structure, says Stephen Beeby, an engineer at the University of Southhampton, United Kingdom. This process helps us hear things we otherwise would not, but as a result some of the energy added by the hair cells escapes, as otoacoustic emissions.15 The study of otoacoustic emissions has expanded to include how selecti ve pitches are formed within the ear. Johns Hopkins University research reveals that one of the otoacoustic emissions is produced by the pineal gland and is amplified by the stapedius muscle of the inner ear. James Cowan16, in his book Environmental Acous tics: Industrial Health and Safety, says that due to its shape, the ear canal can only create the pitches of the notes F, F#, G, G#, and A. Cowan writes, The ear canal is, on average, a tube about 1.2 inches in length depending on age and physiology. The ear canal, which is open on one end and closed by the ear drum on the other, actually resembles a pipe organ and can resonate between 2700 and 3500 hertz (equating to the notes F through A) .17 Additional otoacoustic pitches (other than the notes F throug h A) are recorded coming from the ear. Sharry hypothesizes that the brain creates these frequencies, which are then amplified through the brain fluids (liquids are a highly efficient conductor of sounds) , causing the otoacoustic pitches. Renato Nobili, an Italian physicist who proved that electromagnetic frequencies occur in animal tissues, concurs that currents and wave patterns are found in body fluids. Nobili found that the fluid in cells holds currents and wave patterns and that these correspond with wave patterns picked up by electroencephalogram (EEC) readings in the brain and scalp.18 15 Imfefector - a newsletter featuring innovative steps in technology from around the world. pg. 3. 16 Cowan, James.

Quoting from Cowan, James. 18 McTaggart, Lynne. The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, Harper Collins Publishers: N.Y., 2002. pg. 49. 26 Scientists have hints about how these additional otoacoustic tones are relayed to the ear, but no one knows for s ure how they are transmitted. Since we can record th em outside of the ear, we know they get there somehow. Dr. Tomatis, a French ear, nose and throat specialist, documents the flow of information from the ear to the brain. He states, the cochlea of the ear breaks sound into its various elements and sends its analysis to the brain... The brain begins its process of differentiating frequencies and sending them to pitch receptors. Then after gathering in the temporal cortex of the brain they are distributed throughout the brain.19 Dr. Tomatis confirms that info rmation goes from the ear to the brain. Dr. Tomatis studied the path of the voice within our bodies and its travels along a skeleton. Tomatis believed that the bones of the skull conduct sound waves. To offer a simplistic proof, he suggested that if one hums and allows the sound to reverberate throughout his body, rather than project the humming sound in front of his face, he will feel the voice vibrating his skull.20 It has been postulated that through bone conduction via the skull, the ear receives bra in wave frequencies and amplifies them. This may be why some otoacoustic emissions are different frequencies than the ones our ear hairs produce. Otoacoustic emissions are produced even while we are comatose or asleep. Testing otoacoustic emissions is a s tandard method to determine hearing functions in newborn infants. Anecdotally, audiologists say they can tell different people apart - men, women, even people of different ethnic origins - by the profile of widely varying types of otoacoustic emissions.21 Scientists are attempting to figure out if otoacoutics emissions can be used like biometry, iris scans or finger prints.22 19 Dr. Tomatis. The Ear and the Voice, The Scarecrow Press: Maryland, Toronto, Oxford, 1987. Translated into English in 2005. pg. 85. 20 Dr. Tomatis.

There are numerous studies now relating otoacoustic emissions to specific diseases. This link between otoacoustic emissions and disease may help explain why Sharr y can hear that an individual may be prone to or suffering from a certain disease. Guy Berard, MD, reported that the ear has a full range of frequencies, which can be monitored, recorded and retrained: with the effect being the reversal of diseases su ch as autistic disorder. According to the research reports, the idea is simple and effective: Change the frequency and the body responds by eliminating the disease.25 The body has a feedback loop to diagnose and provide a set of healing and prescriptive f requencies. The loop consists of our voice, which produces sound and our ear that perceives it. The voice emits the composite sounds of our physical, emotional and mental health, signaling when help is needed. This immediately alerts our body to specific h ealth problems. Our bodies instinctively know how to fight an infection, heal a wound or release negative emotion (crying, for example). Perhaps part of the inter -body communication includes otoacoutic emissions. Sharry believes that our ears transmit o toacoustic emissions as stabilizing so unds, which constantly provide healing and stabilize frequencies to the body. This subtle sound energy playing in the background could be part of the body's self -diagnosis and self -repair mechanisms. Together hearing a nd voicing of sound create an intra - body communication system on a deeper level. The voice reflects 23 Edwards, Sharry. Vocal Profiling for the Professional , Sound Health: Albany, Ohio, 2002. pg. M1. 52. 24 Edwards, Sharry. Vocal Profiling for the Professional , Sound Health: Albany, Ohio, 2002. pg. M1.53. 25 Edwards, Sharry. Vocal Profiling for the Professional , Sound Health: Albany, Ohio, 2002. pg. M1.52. 28 what frequencies are in our bodies and the ears radiate what frequencies we need. Dr. Tomatis 's work demonstrates that the sound based communication system in the body affects more than our health. Correcting people's hearing also results in improvements in their learning and emotional problems.26 Sharry hears frequencies near the sides of people's heads that she correlates to emotions, thoughts and health. Not surprisingly, Sharry suspects a link between otoacoustic emissions and our psychological makeup . If our body is aware of otoacoustic emissions on a subconscious level, this could offer an explanation of how people intuitively sense other's emotions and thoughts. At times people sense a strong feeling, without an outward explanation for it. For example, we go into a room and feel that we can cut the air with a knife. Our eyes tell us that everything is fine, but we sense something else. At times we accurately feel people's underlying emotions and thoughts. Are people's emotions and thoughts reflected in tiny sounds emitted from their ears? Can we, on a deep level receive this communication and interpret it? The human mind has the ability to select w hat information it processes consciously. We can focus on one thing, and block out attention paid to something else. For example, we can listen to the teacher lecturing in the classroom or the whispers of the girl sitting next to us. We choose which inform ation is more important and push the other information into the background. We constantly make choices about what is important to us, and the body focuses on the information we deem to be important. Dr. Tomatis categorizes focusing on sound as listening, while he classifies hearing as the absence of paying attention to sound. Hearing is a superficial use of one's ear, while listening implies an act of will to connect with the sonic environment and learn what must be known. Listening is paying attentio n to sound and becoming actively involved in it... The psyche and openness to the outside world interact through the ear. In truth this phenomenon applies to all the sensory organs, but with audition the impact is most 26 www.Tomatis.com 29 remarkable.27 Tomatis sums up the proce ss of listening, The mind impacts audition and the ear impacts the mind.28 What sounds we focus on are affected by our psyche and hence affect us mentally, emotionally and physically. The human mind regularly gives dominance to information coming from ou r sense of sight, dismissing our feelings and sounds. The clich\u00e9 is that seeing is believing. People agree that if we all look at a red dress, that it is unquestionably red. In truth, red is the only thing it isn't. The dye in the dress does not absorb t he color wavelengths of red, and hence the red color wavelengths are reflected back to our eyes. Information from our eyesight does not reveal all the available information, but we think it does . As we develop our visual sense becomes increasingly dominan t. If we think about where the essence of ourselves is, most peopl e say it is behind their eye as opposed to their ears, heart or brain. This reflects our priority of believing visual information rather than other sensory data. It is normal that humans assign less credibility to their feelings and intuition as information from these sources seem fleeting. We can see something and verify its permanence, but sounds and feelings are here then gone. The more we believe only what we see, the more we diminish our intuitive and hearing abilities. Sharry is a living example that the sense of hearing can lead to a highly evolved ability to understand the world around us. The sense of hearing adds depth and dimension to our reality. Back to the Bubble This imag e blurred . From my bubble I saw that Sharry received her undergraduate degree over a twelve year period while she raised three children and then she pursued her master's degree. She was the first person in her family to get a high school degree , much less , a college degree. Gently, the bubble pulled me back from learning about fundamental frequencies and otoacoustic emissions then rolled forward in time again. On this occasion , I saw Sharry working as an administrative 27 Dr. Tomatis. The Ear and the Voice, The Scarecrow Press: Maryland, Toronto, Oxford, 1987. Translated into English in 2005. pg. 87. 28 Dr. Tomatis. The Ear and the Voice, The Scarecrow Press: Maryland, Toronto, Oxford, 1987. Translated into English in 2005. pg. 87. 30 assistant in a local college, which offered free college courses as a fringe benefit. This arrangement enabled Sharry to get her degree in communications with emphasis on dietetics, communication styles and learning modalities. She wrote a book on learning styles and hand analysis.29 She als o obtained her master's degree in curriculum development and instruction, and progressed toward her doct orate in the same field. At the time, the Internet was yet to be invented and Sharry knew of no other sound researchers except , Robert Monroe, who wrote Journey Out of the Body and several other books. Monroe experienced out -of-body travel and associated this consciousness with specific frequencies.30 Sharry journeyed to visit Robert Monroe, but he flatly refused to collaborate with her. This impacted Shar ry in several ways. First, she gathered her discoveries and mad e them available to others on her own. Second, this impeded her attainment of a doctorate degree. She could not put together a required committee of experts regarding sound and health, as there were none available due to the novelty of her discoveries. The college refused to make accommodations for Sharry to earn her doctorate by being flexible or creative with this requirement. From the bubble I often noticed people at work telling Sharry to h ide her hearing and healing abilities lest others perceive her unfavorably. Once again, her gift appeared as a burden. Despite discouragement Sharry continued her explorations into why certain sounds affected the body in specific ways. During her work as an administrative assistant, Sharry experimented by creating healing sounds. For example, as she could hear the exact pitch of a headache, she learned that if she replicated the sound of the headache, the headache got worse. She sang a series of increasing pitches, which sounded like a fire siren. This created a glissando sound with all tiny pitches that are in between the smallest notes of our pianos. As she explored the range of notes, she found one pitch that made the sound of the person's headache go aw ay. She was not sure exactly why or how this worked. Sharry reflected that a mother instinctively sings a lullaby to help her baby sleep. The mother intuitively finds the needed pitch. Likewise, she knew what pitch got 29 Sharry created a system of hand analysis, which she calls amanimology. She related the size and shapes of hands, including fingernails, and related them to personality and learning styles. 30 Read more about Robert Monroe in Ancient Sounds Modern Healing by Jill Mattson at www.jillswingsoflight.com. 31 rid of a specific headache. Sharry al so suggested that when people moan they instinctively use a related pitch that aids their own healing. From her experience Sharry knew some tones heal and others exacerbate problems. If the headache's sound was that of G, singing more G made it worse for some people. However, another pitch such as a C # would mitigate it. Furthermore, there was something about the quality of her voice that others were unable to produce that enabled her to have a positive impact on their complaints. One of Sharry's first discoveries was that a headache in a specific area of the head always sounded exactly the same in all people. For example a headache involving the temporal lobe was always G #. A headache in the back of the head would be a different pitch. Sharry believed that the secret to finding the healing pitch was related to a frequency of the specific muscle in the head. As Sharry conducted her personal research into the correlation between specific sounds that she could hear (coming from people and underlying condi tions such as headaches), she thought that there must exist universal frequencies for each muscle when it is in the normal, healthy and balanced state. This was an important milestone in her development of the foundational concepts of human BioAcoustics. Sharry noticed a correlation between the sound of someone's headache and the onset of slight changes in the person's voice. When the muscle of the head was out of balance for quite some time, then the person's voice became discordant or thin (with missing or weak frequencies) . Therefore, chronic health conditions are readily apparent to her, even though it takes a while for the sound of pain to impact the voice. A personal experience greatly expanded Sharry's comprehension of the value of her hearing gift . She and her daughter, Ronna, were enjoying a swimming outing at Raccoon Creek near Moonville, Ohio. Ronna was swinging on a rope. Ten feet below a rocky ledge, the water became deep enough to dive into. Ronna lost her grasp of the rope and smashed into t he rocky ledge into a few inches of water. Her lower leg muscle was nearly severed and she was bleeding profusely. It took 25 minutes for eme rgency professionals to arrive at this remote summer retreat. Sharry was frightened that her child would bleed to d eath or lose her leg. Sharry administered conventional first 32 aid to stop the bleeding. She heard the distressed signals coming from her daughter's body. Sharry began to sing tones, which you and I could not make. She toned up and down and found pitches tha t lessened the distress sounds emanating from her daughter. The bleeding slowed. At the hospital Sharry continued to make her sounds, but when she stopped, her daughter screamed in pain again. After a seven -week hospitalization Ronna was told that she woul d not walk again. However, with the aid of Sharry's frequencies she eventually enjoyed a full recovery. She still has a scar like a shark bite to remember her incident at Raccoon Creek. Each of our body's organs, body systems and bio -chemicals (such as cortisol, serotonin, histamine, niacin, magnesium, amino acids, hormones, vitamins, minerals, viruses, enzymes, nerves, muscles) has its own frequency and is reflected in pitches within our voices . Each element in our body has its own signature frequency. A BioAcoustic frequency -equivalent can be defined as a frequency representation of a nutrient, muscle, biochemical, genome, pathogen, toxin, gene, or other items in our environment and can represent structural, emotional, metabolic or environmental is sues. These universal frequency biomarkers serve as benchmarks for optimal health. When we have too much or too little of a vitamin, mineral or body substance, the corresponding frequency will be out of the normal range of our voice's architecture . BioAcoustics can pinpoint the exact nutrient or vitamin that is causing a health issue and whether we need less or more of it. Sharry experimented with her friends, family and herself, using the tone de jour to heal aches and pains. She bought severa l instrument tuners to identify the healing tones associated with the health problems of those around her. As she catalogued these frequencies she analyzed the data to figure out the relationship between a specific health problem and a healing frequency. S harry constantly asked herself, Why did this frequency influence this problem? If she \"Just as there is a system of elemental chemical pathways (chemistry) there is a fundamental frequency -based organization to our universe, using mathem atical based mathways. I call this sonistry! \" S. Edwards Sharry Edwards 33 could figure this out, she could calculate appropriate frequencies to address a wide range of maladies. Sharry heard environmental sounds that became incorporated int o people's fundamental frequencies . Frequencies in our mind, body and feelings interact with environmental sounds. This is healthy when we are in a peaceful and beautiful location. However, there are many external influences that are unharmonious to our bo dies. Our bodies need balance. There are many ways to get out of balance, such as: Consuming man -made chemical additives in food Being exposed to environmental toxins and pollution Being near too many free -floating frequencies from cell phones, microwave s, computers, TVs, power plants, radio waves... Dr. Robert Becker, a scientist, author and physician, studied the impact of external frequencies and their impact on our health. All abnormal man -made electromagnetic fields, regardless of their frequencies, produce the same biological effects. These effects, which deviate from normal functions and are actually or potentially harmful, are the following: Effects on growing cells, such as increases in the rate of cancer - cell division Increases in the incidence of certain cancers Developmental abnormalities in embryos Alterations in neuro -chemicals, resulting in behavioral abnormalities Alterations in biological cycles Stress responses in exposed animals that if prolonged, lead to declines in immune -system effici ency Alterations in learning ability Being exposed to any abnormal field... affects a number of stress - related diseases and cancers... If prolonged, this decreases the efficiency of the immune system, resulting in an increased incidence of infectious disease s and cancers.31 31 Becker, Robert, Dr. Cross Currents, The Perils of Electropollution, The Promise of Electromedicine , Penguin Group: New York, 1990, pg. 214. 34 Our internal harmony is constantly challenged, stretched and attacked from external sources. Sharry was learning how to harmonize out of balance frequencies, whether or not they originated from within us or came from our environment. My bubble took me forward in time. I watched Sharry enrolling in a parapsychology course at Ohio University's Communiversity; Sharry quickly became a co -teacher of the course. Sharry often demonstrated the phenomena that the professor discussed. She taught this class for ten years. At that time, it becam e apparent to her that there were no place s to buy parapsychology items, such as dowsing rods, books, and other items. In 1976 Sharry started Esoteric Unlimited, a store that offered such products locally. As Sharry's reputation grew in parapsychology, she gave an interview on a radio talk show regarding reincarnation. People who deemed that reincarnation was sinfu l picketed the radio station . Sharry wa tched the picketing from the radio office; she snuck ou t the rear door and joined the picket line. She identified the picketers' leader and promptly started a friendly conversation . This opened the lines of communication and the disagreement dissipated! This person would later refer to Sharry as a friend. This episode showed Sharry's tenacious, yet winning, nature. Anyone who is introducing a new paradigm counter to the entrenched medical system needs determination and perseverance . In another example of tenacity, a man fired a shot near Sharry's house as a warning after hearing about her parapsychology endeavors. Sharry discovered who this man was and scheduled a meeting with him. She directly confronted him regarding the alleged shooting at her house. During this conversation Sharry addressed and answered the rumors that he had heard about her. Direct communication mitigated this man's anxieties and stopped his threatening behavior. Once again, this incident shows Sharry's courage and resolve. Few people, indeed, would follow up with a face -to-face meeting with someone who was shooting at them. Sharry's husband, Bill, favored a business model that integrated Sharry's discoveries into the mainstream health care world to avoid being categorized with alternative health care services. He believed that piggyba cking on the medical field would yield quicker 35 acceptance of this accurate, inexpensive and non -invasive analytical and treatment tool. The bubble rolled forward and I saw Sharry in the 1980s changing her business's name to Dimensional Resources, which s ounded more conventional. By 1995 Sharry had developed the basic foundations of her BioAcoustic system. Furthermore, she had formulated frequency databases and proven methods to enable others to support optimal wellness with sounds, just as she did. A new vision for the business was coming into focus. Sharry's business would record and interpret people's energies to determine ways to balance them in the body, enabling it to heal itself. Most importantly, she developed a system to train others to do vocal pr ofiling using tools and instruments that she developed. The new corporation was called Signature Sound Works. The new corporation did not last long as an office manager embezzled a large sum of money that forced Sharry and her family to make sacrifices, re structure, re -plan and rebuild the business. After this setback in 1996 the title of the corporation was changed to Sound Health Alternatives. From my bubble I saw similar scenes fly by, one after another. I saw a lamp burning steadily in Sharry's window as the clock struck 4:00 am. Sharry, a night owl, spent night after night digging through research and new scientific discoveries to expand her theories, draw comparisons and discover another set of healing frequencies for the next software package releas e. A related nonprofit corporation entitled Sound Health Research was also created to enable the organization to receive tax -free donations and services. A board of directors was established, creating an organization capable of spearheading efforts to es tablish the methods of sound healing - accelerating success in reaching and helping greater numbers of people. The concepts that Sharry unveil ed created the foundation for a new medicin e. Big changes can be difficult and threatening to people. Traditional medicine, the paradigm of the human body and how it works are core beliefs of Western thought. Sharry's mother -in-law had macular degeneration. Sharry exposed her to balancing frequency -equivalents , as revealed by her voiceprint. Almost immediately her mother -in-law's macular degeneration 36 significantly improved and her sight returned to normal. Sharry's brother -in-law also had macular degeneration. He refused to listen to frequency -equivalents even though they helped his mother. His reasoning was that hi s doctor had not heard of BioAcoustics. He would not try anything that his doctor did not recommend. Many people will not sway from conventional approaches to health care. Sharry's BioAcoustic tones positively impact people, but they are reticent to cred it their success to the sounds. Sharry described giving a doctor a tone box for an ailment. He quickly recovered. Sharry did not hear from him until he lost his tone box. He explained that when he got better, he assumed that he got better naturally and did not attribute his recovery to her sound box. It was only when he stopped listening to the tone b ox and his symptoms returned, that he credit ed the sounds as his source of help. Why is a change in thinking so difficult especially when there are so many be nefits for people? We have created personal databanks from the information we have received throughout life. We form conclusions and base perceptions on this accumulated information. It is our own way of looking at the world. When we receive new informatio n we subconsciously filter and format it to fit our existing model. When we receive information that doesn't fit our view of the world, we experience stress. We feel as though a part of our reality is falling apart. It feels like our foundations are coll apsing, which, in a subtle sense, they are. When our beliefs are challenged our fight or flight mode becomes operational. We don't give up our way of thinking without a fight. To make a paradigm shift we must make a fundamental change in how we underst and our world. This involves reorganizing much of our data and the ways that we observe and react to information and events. This is a major change in thinking, affecting our structures of consciousness. It is no easy task to make a paradigm shift! Some enlightened thinkers have presented a possible reason as to why a major shift in one's thinking is consistently challenging beyond obvious inertia. Scientists acknowledge that weak electromagnetic fields surround every living biological organism, and in deed are given 37 off by every component, down to the smallest atomic structure.32 Rupert Sheldrake uses this point to conclude why it is energetically difficult to change an ingrained perception or belief system. People have energy fields - their thoughts an d beliefs get integrated into this field, creating an energy barrier that is resistant to change. Sheldrake points out that if we chop up a magnet into little pieces, each piece generates its own magnetic energy field. Each organ, tissue and cell also has its own field. Sheldrake believes that each person's beliefs and perceptions create an energetic field in which similar thoughts are attracted and collected. He draws a comparison between this idea and Carl Jung's theory of the collective subconscious, wh ich he distinguishes from the personal subconscious particular to each human being. The collective subconscious reflects the consensus of the majority of people like a reservo ir of the experiences of our species.33 Sheldrake proposes that these morphic energy fields influence everything from the migratory patterns of birds to plant growth, people's common beliefs and the collective subconscious. Sheldrake believes that this energy defines and characterizes individuals, more so than DNA . He likens DNA to hardware that we inherit from our parents, but we download our traits from the collective subconscious of the human race. He believes that these collected subtle energy fields create a powerful force on individuals to follow the crowd, while thinking differently than the mainstream of thought is like swimming against the tide. A German biophysicist, Pfritz Popp, helped form the International Institute of Biophysicists, which researches the possibility of a complex network of resonances and frequencies as the body's communication system.34 He wrote, In quantum physics, quantum coherence means that subatomic particles not only know about each other , but also are highly interlinked by bands of common electromagnetic fields, so that they can communicate with each other. They are like, a multitude of tuning forks' that all begin resonating 32Sheldrake, Rupert. Spring 1987: Mind Memory Archetype: Morphic Resonance and the Collective Unconscious. Quoted from Bartlett, Richard. Matrix Energetics , Atria Books: N.Y., N.Y., 2007. pg. 30. 33 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious 34 McTaggart, Lynne. The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, Harper Collins Publisher: New York, 2002, pg. 53. 38 together. As the waves get into phases of sync, they begin act ing like one giant wave and one giant subatomic particle. It becomes difficult to tell them apart. Many of the weird quantum effects seen in a single wave apply to the whole. Something done to one of them will affect all the others.35 Popp confirmed inter -body vibratory communication. Popp continued, Coherence establishes communication. It's like a subatomic telephone network. The better the coherence, the finer the telephone network and the more that refined wave patterns have a telephone. The end result is a bit like a large orchestra. All the photons are playing together, but as individual instruments...36 Sheldrake suggests that systems of thoughts have their own collective fields of energy. For example, g iven the solidarity of people's respect surround ing our medical profession, any new idea that could be perceived as threatening to the medical community is met with a strong field of resistance. He believes that long -established belief systems represent an energy that is highly resistant to change. Individuals unknowingly draw on supportive energy when they agree with the majority of people in a field of thought. Sheldrake believes this explains why endorsing an opposing belief is such a daunting task. Whether one believes Sheldrake's ideas or not, his tory undisputedly shows the struggle creative people experience when introducing new ideas. Innovative thinkers have always been harassed by society. Novel and unconventional ways to treat disease do not negate the great accomplishments of the medical fie ld. Parallel concepts, such as vibrational medicine, can complement traditional medicine and assist doctors. Sharry works hand -in-hand with many physicians. The revelation of frequency and energy medicine can move humanity light speed ahead, propelling tra ditional medicine as well! It is no surprise that Sharry encountered a great number of obstacles. An anonymous caller insisted that she just lie down and die, and Federal officials instructed, Do not tell anyone that you have found a 35 McTaggart, Lynne. The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, Harper Collins Publisher: New York, 2002, pg. 53. 36 McTaggart, Lynne. The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, Harper Collins Publisher: New York, 2002, pg. 43. 39 cure for a disease . She regularly gets threatening phone calls at her yearly conference. Many detractors stole information and set up competitive companies. Many struggle with opposition from high levels of business and government, but the number of incidences makes one wonder why Sharry is being given such a hard time. Is it because her discoveries and new avenues of medical treatment threaten the financial bottom - line of existing companies? I remember chuckling when Sharry told me, Expect someone to emulate, stop or ci rcumvent you, if you have something of value that might be of a threat to his theories or pocketbook. Sharry does not want any corporation to use her protocols to control the health of the general population. One of her mottos is, whoever controls peop le's health controls the people. She does not want her discoveries exploiting people or destroying the common good. She has not sold her information to pharmaceutical or medical companies, or foreign countries, though she has had offers to do so. Heroes are often least appreciated in their hometown. People stereotype and resist any change in their existing beliefs and perceptions. For example , my neighbor's wife can't cure a new disease, she is just a housewife! Being ordinary and extraordinary at the same time can cause negative reactions from friends and acquaintances - familiarity can breed contempt. Even Sharry's own family did not initially believe that her unusual tones could produce such incredible results. Her husband was not a firm believer un til he experienced them himself; since then he has became a solid and ardent supporter. Sharry's mother only opened herself to hearing Sharry's sounds after learning that she had but a brief time to live. Sharry then set up a sound machine under her mother 's hospital bed and, much to the doctor's surprise, her mother made a complete recovery as her body created its own heart bypass. Often it takes a life -changing experience, such as the one Sharry's mother had, to make a lasting shift in perspectives. Peo ple are intimidated by solutions that are fundamentally different than the status quo. In order to accept these solutions, most people must experience a significant incident to alter their energy, eliminate resistance to change and allow them to accept a n ew way. 40 The flipside of this phenomenon is that once someone has stretched his or her mind to include a new way of believing, it does not go back to its previous narrow -minded state. One by one, people incorporate new ideas about healing into their thinki ng. This is how s ocial change occurs: one by one , people create a new, expanded model of ideas with which to view their world. There is a school of thought which holds that only a small percentage of people need to divert their thinking from an establish ed belief in order for others to easily shift their thinking. Proponents of this theory point to a research study published by The Journal of Conflict Resolution showing that when a group of people meditated on peace, local violent activities decreased. Th ey believe this demonstrates that a small group of people's thoughts can create an energy that affects a larger group of people. Jonathan Goldman, sound healing author and composer, advocates that research on the power of group meditations has shown that in order to affect a large group of people there only needs to be the square root of one percent of the population, or about 8,000 people, taking part in a meditation to influence the earth's population .37 Slowly but surely, more people are accepting the benefits of sound healing. One by one, people are accepting that the correct frequencies and rhythms can heal and balance stressed frequencies in the body, helping them to achieve total wellness. Sharry wants her findings to benefit all people. She has d edicated herself to this noble goal, but she faces constraints due to limited funding. Specifically, Sharry is operating a facility and paying all associated expenses and staff as she educates the public and carries on her research. I visited Sharry's So und Health facility, located in an old school building in Albany, Ohio. When I last spoke to Sharry, she had not written herself a paycheck in over five months. She lives modestly, putting much of any income back into her work. She is not interested in per sonal gain, but rather she is in tent on getting her message out and that costs money! 37 Goldman, Jonathan. Quoted in the book by Mattson, Jill . Ancient Sounds Modern Healing, Wings of Light: Pa. 2006. pg. 137. 41 To accomplish these larger goals Sharry maintains some trade secrets so people will purchase her informational products and services. Specifically, she retains detailed proprietary information of vocal rhythm patterns and the associated frequency codes. She trains practitioners who use her techniques and database information. She discloses her discoveries and frequency protocols to her trained practitioners. She has a com prehensive library and students who come to Sound Health get the latest and most innovative techniques. Many people have copied Sharry's work without crediting her. While some use the information to create excellent services, a few provide slipshod work that could be potentially harmful to the credibility of the sound healing field. Sharry has sued a few people who have blatantly stolen and pirated her work. Lawsuits are expensive, emotionally draining and often unsatisfying. If she were to protect her discoveries all of the time, she would have little time and energy remaining to advance this new field. I tried to get the bubble to move forward into the future. I wished to see how this story ends. Does Sharry succeed in overcoming the resistance she fac es? Do we step forth and help educate others so that people can realize the incredible promises of improved health benefits? Do HMO's embrace this medicine of the future? Do a few companies steal these ideas and get rich, or does Sharry prevail and take th e BioAcoustic system mainstream, so that large groups of people can benefit inexpensively? The bubble would not move. I realized that you and I determine the future! A dog's wet nose woke me up from my nap at the old oak tree. The bubble was gone. The ai r was cold. I smiled, thinking of all the history I had seen. What a treat! I could not wait to get back to work with Sharry. I had learned a great deal. I had exciting new technical information on sound healing and I was eager to delve into why Sharry's m ethods work. 42 Chapter Two Receiving Sharry's Gifts As we saw in chapter one, Sharry was born into and grew up in a world where sound played a much larger role than it does for most people. The full scientific basis for Sharry's capabilities is beyond our current understanding, but this situation will change. Progress has been made and will accelerate as research and emphasis on the emerging frontier of sound healing continues. Sharry could naturally hear subtle sounds in people's voices far beyond t heir spoken words. These extrasensory sounds held incredible variety. As Sharry grew, she thoroughly learned this hidden language and discover ed characteristic and unbalanced sounds in the voices of people with underlying health problems. She concurrently generate d powerful sounds far exceeding the range and power of the normal human voice. It seemed Sharry could instinctively play with tones that would correct the unharmonious tones emanating from people around her. It may have been instinct or perhaps she learned to hear and communicate on a higher plane. What is clear is that Sharry could associate frequencies with specific illness and create tones that enabled the body to heal itself. As Sharry matured , she took the pioneering step of understand ing her gift and making her new modality widely available to humanity. She grasped the implications of creating effective, low cost, hi ghly selective health care. These efforts will make a lasting impact on mankind and permanently write Sharry's name in history. Sharry still conducts research and she steadily builds her understanding of this emerging science. She is limited by financial and human constraints, but she plows on tirelessly with the overriding goal of making her discoveries as widely available as poss ible. She could have been rich if she exploited her personal talents ; instead, she has spent her life building a system that she can leave behind to benefit mankind. Sharry formulated a two -pronged objective: 43 To enable others to duplicate what she hears u sing software she developed (and understand the implications of what the sounds mean) To devise a method whereby people can provide the tones that she vocalizes through programmable analog tone box es. While working with an audiologist, Sharry learned that a fast Fourier transform (FFT)38 converts recorded vocal sounds into numeric data. This technique measures frequency in cycles per second (hertz) and volume ( decibels). A visual graph is created showing the size and phase relationships between pitches. Wit h trial -and-error testing, Sharry confirmed that the information in the voiceprint produced by the FFT was indeed similar to what she was hearing. She spent years working with the FFT, making it more accurate for her purposes. Use of the FFTs provide d a me thod to enable others to see what she could hear. Next came years of working with voiceprint data to discover what specific pitches, shapes, architecture and rhythm patterns meant. In Part Two, Technical Details, there is an entire chapter dealing with discoveries related to the information contained within the voiceprint. When Sharry began this work, the Internet was not yet popular and computer usage was in its infancy. As computers became a widely available tool, Sharry's ability to analyze voice d ata grew exponentially, so did her corresponding understanding of sounds in the voice. These experiences spawned the idea of including FFTs in computer software programs. Sharry then worked with computer programmers to use her analytical frequency data to enable others to interpret the sounds that she had spent her life's work identifying. The logical next step crystallized as she searched for reasonably priced microphones, sound cards and free sound programs for computers to enable large numbers of people to access BioAcoustic information. 38 In 1822, Joseph Fourier , a French mathematician, discovered that sinusoidal waves can be used as simple building blocks to make up and describe nearly any periodic waveform, even irregular sound waves made by h uman speech . The process is named Fourier analysis . In mathematics , the Fourier transform is an operation that transforms one complex function of a variable into another. The new function...describes which frequencies are present in the original function. This is similar to t he way a chord of music described harmony that we hear. The Fourier transform decomposes a function into oscillatory functions. FFTs are computationally efficient algorithms commonly used to convert analog vocal data to dig ital numeric data for rapid spectral analysis. 44 People can collect voice samples with a unidirectional condenser microphone39 that was linked to a computer with a sound card. The one-directional microphone filter s out background extraneous sounds, like those from the cat's meow or a car door slamming. Now, even more effective noise -filtering programs are used. Sound Boxes As part of her two -pronged approach Sharry simultaneously worked toward solving the riddle of how to enable students to select the appropriat e engaging frequencies and how to deliver them to people. At first, Sharry rigged stereo equipment with subwoofers capable of replicating rich lower tones. When instructing others to recreate this sound system, they often made critical shortcuts, which im peded their success. Sharry worked with manufacturers to provide portable, small tone boxes that delivered the high quality sounds that she needed. One of the first choices faced when creating tone boxes was to choose a digital or analog format of record ing the initial sounds. When we talk to each other in person, we hear analog sounds. When we talk on newer phones, we hear digitally reproduced sounds. The sound has been converted to digital data and transferred over transmission lines to the phone. Sharry believes that greater expressive information is encoded in analog sound as opposed to digital reproductions. Analog sounds replicate a refined conversion of sound data that approximates the original sound as closely as possible. A digital sound combin es a range of tones . This information is average d and called a bit . This advantage allows for faster data transfer. Digital cameras have pixels. The quality of a digital camera is measured in part by the number of pixels it uses in making digital photos. The more pixels it employs, the more the digital photograph approximates a picture captured on chemical emulsion photo film. 39 Condenser microphones span the range from inexpensive karaoke mics to high -fidelity recording mics. They generally produce a high -quality audio signal and are now the popular choice in laboratory and studio recording applications. They require a power source. Power is necessary for establishing the capacitor plate voltage and amplification of the signal. 45 Digital sound recordings work the same way. They capture samp le bits of sound. Sharry believes that the decision to use digital or analog recording styles is critical. She relentlessly pursues the studies, theories and information released by leading scientists regarding the transfer of waves, energy and information in the human body. Her research led her to the conclusion that ana log tone boxes should be used. There is more detail on how the body communicates in Part Two, Technical Details. For now we will briefly review how information is transferred via the perineural system in the body. Audiologist, Dorrine Davis summarizes, The perineural tissue cells surround each neuron in the brain, accounting for more than half of the brain's cells. They follow every perineural nerve to its endpoint. The information in the perineural system is spread throughout the entire body via the cent ral nervous system that cooperates to send information to specific places.40 The central nervous system allows for control of body sensations and movement, and feedback of various activities within the body. In contrast, the perineural connective system integrates and regulates the body processes (such as wound healing).41 The central nervous system sends information in digital -like fashion , while the perineural connective system sends information from the brain in analog -like form.42 Dr. Becker, who was twice nominated for a Nobel Prize,43 has substantiated a DC analog current system found hidden within the central nervous system.44 40 Davis, Dorinne. S ound Bodies through Sound Therapy , Kalco Publishing: Landing, New Jersey, 2004. pg. 262. 41 Guzzetta, CE. Adolf, ER, Supplement. Footnote 141 in Dorinne Davis's Sound Bodies through Sound Therapy, pg. 261. 42 Davis, Dorinne. S ound Bodies through Sound Therapy , Kalco Publishing: Landing, New Jersey, 2004. pg. 261. 43 Dr. Robert Becker is a pioneering researcher of electricity and regeneration. He is an orthopedic surgeon and a professor at N.Y. State University, Upstate Medical Center and at the Louisiana Sate University Medical Center. He has authored The Body Electric and Cross Currents , The Perils of Electropollution, The Promise of Electromedicine, 44 Becker, Robert, Dr. Cross Currents, The Perils of Electropollution, The Promise of Electromedicine , Penguin Group: New York, 1990, pg. 62. 46 Becker explains, We commonly think of the brain as being packed with billions of nerve cells. While there are billions of nerve cells in the brain, there are as many, if not more perineural cells. In fact these cells are found wherever nerve cells and nerve fibers are found.45 The perineural system is activated prior to the nerve impulses; it appears to make actual decisions and regulate consciousness.46 Dr. Becker also writes that too much energy overloads the system, producing bodily damage. The body energy systems use subtle, electrical control systems; the idea that more energy is better is outright dangerous.47 Based on t his research and her independent findings , Sharry uses analog tones for her work. Sharry experimented with various octave levels of sound and discovered that the body responds best to lower frequency sounds. Lower frequencies were usually more potent for healing and this practice is consistent with Dr. Becker's advice. Sharry lowered her healing pitches by octaves so that the sounds were in the lower end of our hearing range, below 64 hertz. Humans begin hearing at about 14 hertz. Her responsive sounds ar e in the ranges of brain wave frequencies and can entrain them . Brainwave entrainment is a process in which brainwave frequenc ies fall into step with a stronger frequency in close p roximity. This may be done , for example, to induce sleep. The earlier versions of sound boxes were the size of two laptop computers. Now, individually designed frequency formulations are program med into a small box about the size of a deck of cards , call ed a Square Two -Tonebox that is a small analog frequency generator. The box t ypically has a headphone and subwoofer capacities for clarity of deep tones. Sharry developed another device to deliver sounds called a SMAD (Self-Management Auditory Device). The SMAD has a dual 45 Becker, Robert, Dr. Cross Currents, The Pe rils of Electropollution, The Promise of Electromedicine, Penguin Group: New York, 1990, pg. 63. 46 Becker, Robert, Dr. Cross Currents, The Perils of Electropollution, The Promise of Electromedicine, Penguin Group: New York, 1990, pg. 65. 47 Becker, Robe rt, Dr . Cross Currents, The Perils of Electropollution, The Promise of Electromedicine, Penguin Group: New York, 1990, pg. 169. 47 frequency generator that produces individual tones. This machine is used to test tones before they are programmed into the tone boxes. Sharry uses a dual frequency generator to pan sound in different directions. Sharry related that ea rlier in her research a company hired her to use her voice to scramble information stored on iron oxide magnetic tape48 recordings. This company dupl icated the sounds that she made because her voice could scramble stored information on tapes. They could not duplicate her sounds without duel frequency generators. Additional sound delivery systems are being implemented, including a sound bed vibratory system. Chapter Three Sharry's Legend Grows In interviewing Sharry and a number of close colleagues, family and friends, it became apparent that some early episodes greatly affected Sharry and shaped her ensuing career with BioAcoustics. There are many accounts of Sharry's amazing deeds; some have grown to be near legends in the area where she grew up. Sharry's husband is extremely practical, down -to-earth and a soft spoken man. Bill carefully t ells stories with minute detail and is reluctant to jump to hasty conclusions. Bill related his own personal experiences and what convinced him to believe that S harry's discoveries can work as well or better than conventional medicine. Bill has been physically fit his entire life and always worked outside doing rigorous, physically demanding jobs. He was a serious tennis player and enjoyed other sports. Due to hi s active life style Bill developed synovitus - an inflammation of a membrane which lines joints such as the knee. The condition is usually painful, particularly 48 ferric oxide tapes ( cassette tapes) 48 when the joint is moved frequentl y. The joint usually swells due to fluid collection. Sharry was in the early stages of her career at this time and as was Bill's habit, he turned to his long time family physician for care. He received a strong anti -inflammatory drug, naproxen, for his kn ee. Fortunately, he did not experience any side effects and in six weeks the pain was gone, although he still needed to wear a supportive bandage on his knee. Over the years, the synovitus occasionally fla red up. T he medicine was expensive, so Bill avoided using it. Within four years, the pain and inflammation were back in full force. He could not bend or fully extend his leg. In the time since Bill's initial bout with synovitus, Sharry had made systematic progress with her resear ch. She had honed the pro cess of identifying and cataloguing frequencies that alleviated muscle problems. This time , Bill used Sharry's process for the treatment of synovitus rather than taking his customary trip to the doctor's office. His recovery took the same amount of time, b ut there were no expensive drugs or trips to the doctor. Bill believes that his brain had already learned the frequency of the naproxen when he previously took the medication and that Sharry's sounds enabled the brain to stimulate the same response that th e body had when he took naproxen. Bill recalled two other near miracles he had with sound healing. On one occasion, a torn hamstring muscle was bleeding internally, preventing him from walking. Normal recovery time is a year, but he was back on the tenni s courts in about five weeks with frequency - based muscle repairs. He recalled another injury in which his recovery was even more remarkable. He tore his abdominal muscles in a nasty work -related accident. Weeks went by with no healing. Finally, he asked Sh arry for help. She created tones with her voice and within two days he was much better and able to resume his active lifestyle. One day Bill noticed a man in the grocery store wearing a shirt with a tennis logo; the man suffered from a terrible limp. For some reason the usually introverted Bill approached the man. After a brief introduction they found that they shared many interests. Their common passion was tennis. A few days later Bill's new friend, Bob, 49 decided to hit a few tennis balls. Bill was reluct ant, given how severely Bob dragged his foot, but Bob was determined to play. On the tennis courts, Bill took it easy on Bob, hitting the ball directly to him. Bob gamely tried to play, but he painfully limped around the tennis court. Bob could not run a nd it was obvious that he was struggling badly. Bob went to Bill's house for a snack and to relax after playing tennis. Bob began to tell his story of how he injured his leg and acquired the disabling limp. He explained that he had suffered a traumatic in jury on a motorcycle. A truck pulled in front of him while he was riding at high speed and he plowed into the back of the truck. His leg was nearly severed just below the knee. Fortunately, a medical team was on the scene within minutes and his life was sa ved. After several years of rehabilitation Bob still had a severe limp and used a cane. Bob was an accomplished athlete before the accident and he worked exhaustively to regain his mobility and strength. He was relentless in his efforts to get his leg bac k to normal and as a result he tried a number of experimental surgeries. In one procedure, muscles from his back were transplanted to his leg to reconstruct the damaged areas. After exhaustive treatment and physical therapies Bob was somewhat better, but s till walk ed with a pronounced limp and terrible pain. His foot twisted to the right when he walked, making his gait slow and unsteady. Bill suggested that Sharry could help him, but Bob's former hopes of recovery had proved to be so disappointing that he refused Sharry's help. During another visit, Sharry listened to Bob's voice as he was talking to Bill during a match. Without Bob's knowledge of what she was doing Sharry played tones in the background when they returned to the house. After about an hour , she asked him about his leg pain. To Bob's surprise it had faded considerably and he was able to walk down the stairs without pain. After he personally experienced the pain relief of the sounds, Bob was excited and hopeful about Sharry's assistance . With in a few months of regularly listening to Sharry's sound therapy, Bob was much better. After only a few initial sound sessions Bob experienced greatly reduced pain and even stopped taking his daily pain pills. After a few months of the program Bob had no p ain and he 50 had gained strength in the leg; amazingly the leg had reshaped and had a much improved appearance. Although he still walked with a limp, he was virtually pain free and had greatly improved his overall mobility. After two years , he had no pain or limp. Bob no longer considered himself to be handicapped, as he immersed himself into an athletic lifestyle again. Bill believes that Sharry's frequency formulas affect the brain as much as the body. He speculated that the frequencies activated Bob's brain, enabling it to send signals to the back muscles that were now in Bob's leg, establishing a connection and directing them to function in their new location. Sometimes , due to faulty genetics, injury or illness, the brain is unable to create the necessa ry signals to repair a situation. Bill believes that it is not only the sounds that influence the body to heal, but that they activate t he brain, providing necessary signals and reestablish ing connections as in Bob's case. The brain's delicate operations a re not entirely understood and the study of BioAcoustics may allow scientists to gain breakthrough knowledge that will g reatly extend our understanding of how the brain works. At the moment t hese ideas are not thoroughly explained scientifically , but the visible and tangible resu lts of BioAcoustics speak loud and clear . These results provide evidence that this process can change our medical world. Early in her career, Sharry encountered a retired military officer who asked for her help. The retired soldi er suffered from emphysema so badly that he could not breathe when he lay down in a bed. He was forced to live a life of inactivity - he could only dream of his former hobby of playing golf. Sharry prepared a frequency cocktail and after listening to hi s sounds for a few days, the man was soon out of bed, puttering in the garage. A month after his amazing progress, he suffered a sudden relapse. Sharry visited the man to reassess his frequencies. While she was there she discovered that a television set ha d been placed in the room where he listened to Sharry's frequencies - the TV countered the beneficial sou nds. With the removal of the TV his recovery was back on track, resulting i n his return to the golf course. This incident made a significant impression on Sharry and afterwards her interest in sound healing grew to new heights; she committed her life to understanding and sharing her healing gifts. 51 Another friend of Bill's also had emphysema. He had heard of Sharry's successes. This man was unable to sp eak an entire sentence without halting, and resorted to pulling his arms behind his head to get enough air into his lungs and utter a soft phrase. As he started his treatment with Sharry , he stopped taking his medicine to see if the frequencies alone would improve his condition. Bill describes the day that Sharry tested the frequencies and how he watched his friend's breathing improve in a short time. Sharry asked that the TV be turned off as the TV waves would interfere and alter the beneficial influence of the frequencies. Unable to resist the temptation of watching Chris Evert's tennis match, he ignored those directions. In spite of his limited cooperation, he dropped his hands from behind his head, started telling stories and speaking in full sentences. Ricki i, Sharry's daughter, described a demobilizing back sprain and then walking away from the first sound treatment pain free. With continued sound healing her back was completely better within days. She also related stories about violent allergic reacti ons to wheat and dairy products. Now, she carries a small tone box that eliminates allergy symptoms in minutes, as she savors anything on the menu while eating out. The last story was that of Ricki i's daughter, who was diagnosed with severe autistic disord er at four years of age. Joselyn was unable to communicate normally even though she had learned to read at an unusually young age. Within days of listening to sonic -medicine provided by Sharry, Joselyn spoke clearly using full sentences. She interact ed with her world in an entirely new way! Today she leads a near normal life with minimal autistic symptoms. Jesse, Sharry's son, was eighteen when he shattered his knee on a parking meter in a motorcycle accident. Sharry used her own voice to supply healing t ones. To the amazement of the medical community , his knee rebuilt itself and he grew a new kneecap. His damaged leg connected to a new nerve supply and his broken bones healed without any scarring. June is a volunteer at Sound Health. She is a former law enforcement officer and, as such, she was skeptical of anything that she did not see firsthand. She received a frequency formula from Sharry that in just two days healed a serious and painful foot injury, which had badly hobbled her. She became a BioAcoust ic believer and volunteer at Sound Health . 52 June enthusiastically described a woman who clung to her husband for support in order to walk . The poor man also lugged her oxygen tank into Sharry's office. After her initial auditory experience , she walked to her car on her own. Barely stopping to take a breath, June continued with an amazing account describing a man with an eye problem who regained enough sight to read in just one day! Terrance Bugno, MD, and Jonathan Murphy, MD, confirmed that listening to l ow frequency sounds could alleviate painful symptoms for gout sufferers with in minutes. For gout sufferers like myself, this is like a miracle! st ated Dr. Murphy. Normally when I have a flare up, it takes two to three days for symptoms to subside and th en I am left with the unpleasant side effects from the medication. It's hard to believe that with BioAcoustics you can actually watch the swelling and redness disappear before your eyes. There is no end to these types of stories that people close to Shar ry can recite. It is interesting that Sharry's methods have worked on a wide variety of drastically different physical ailments -emphysema , gout, autistic disorder and muscular problems. Many case studies have videotaped testimonies with before and after s hots, bringing hope to the hearts of many. These results plead for further studies and investigations of the effects of frequencies within the body.

The 60 Summary of Part One Hopefully you have gained an appreciation of the major influences Sharry faced growing up and how she s et out on the course that led to the creation of BioAcoustics. In summary : 1. Sharry Edwards was born with extrasensory hearing - the ability to hear frequencies outside the range of the normal human ear. 2. She hears sounds emanating from a wide range of sou rces like inanimate objects such as rocks and the environment to people's bodies. 3. Factors that may have played a part in Sharry's gift of extrasensory hearing where being raised in a natural environment without manmade electro - magnetic pollution ; a h ealthy lifestyle of hard work, fresh air, pure food and water and a near -drowning incident. 4. From an early age, Sharry was able to develop the ability to vocally produce extraordinary sounds. 5. She learned the sounds for specific illnesses by making connectio ns between sounds she perceived emanating from some people and their illnesse s as well as, observed the link between discordant sounds and specific emotional stress. 6. Sharry's vocalizations altered people's health in a positive manner and through time, she has developed a library of healing sounds that support optimal health. 7. She induced a state of openness in moving away from conventional methods, seeking reasons to explain her auditory world by looking for scientific explanations for her experiences and u ltimately, creating BioAcoustics. Sharry's natural curiosity has provided her with opportunities to understand the underpinnings of what she could hear and voice. When names of some of Sharry's databases such as and Svani encoded many times in the Bible Code . 61 the experts told Sharry that it was impossible to hear what she did, it only deepened h er resolve to understand more about sound. Sharry's auditory experiences shaped her view of the world, creating a link between sound and health. Most people do not consider the impact of sound on their bodies. By deciphering the meaning of the ever-chang ing chorus of sounds that she lives in, Sharry builds a different perspective regarding auditory cause and effect linking our environment and us. From Sharry's viewpoint, there is no question of whether sound can affect our health. S he refine s and repeat s processes, replicates her actions and resulting data, and BioAcoustic practitioners contribute case studies . With this information she adds validation to the BioAcoustic knowledge -base. Sharry has labored long and hard to overcome the difficulties assoc iated with the challenges of creating a comprehensive methodology and a business that flies in the face of conventional thinking and medical practice. Thanks to her tenacious nature, she continues to advance BioAcoustics . History teaches that fortuitous combinations are usually required to produce breakthroughs \u2014so it was with Sharry. With her unique gifts, thirst for knowledge, dogged persistence and determination \u2014the ingredients were in place for some extraordinary discoveries resulting in a new science, BioAcoustics. 62 PART TWO TECHNICAL DETAILS Introduction Part Two of this book features challenging technical details of BioAcoustics. It not only contains fascinating information for advanced sound enthusiasts but also attainable knowle dge for the determined beginner. It is not necessary to read this information to take advantage of sound healing benefits. The reader uninterested in the working theories of BioAcoustics or not prepared to delve into more technical details can just skip to Part Three, Applications. In a closer investigation of Part Two , you will f ind many of Sharry's theories about how sound affects us. By observing thousands of voiceprints and combining this information with scientific research that corroborates with h er results, she teaches us about sound in terms of science, the mathematical language of the brain, brain dominance and its effects on processing frequencies, the applications of color theories interlaced with frequency tonics and more unsuspected connecti ons. Based on years of observing tiny, subtle musical components that are combined in our voices, Sharry formulates and tests her hypotheses. Steadily growing audiences listen to Sharry's sound presentations, giving her numerous opportunities to perfect her practices and ensure that they work time after time. A large group of practitioners regularly feed data and ideas into her growing knowledge base. Sharry often jokes that she wants data to further her research and if you eliminate your problems when s he conducts her research that is your business. Sharry's practice is very much on the cutting edge of science . Her theories and methods stretch the imagination of conventional thinkers, opening up new vistas. Sharry knows that her methods work ; it is only a matter of time before they are fully explained by science. Part Two reviews numerous scientific findings that confirm segments of 63 BioAcoustics. Her ideas beg for more study, modification and explanation. This section continues with a novel view on ho w vibratory waves communicate information throughout the body and not exclusively for the purpose of hearing. Some related scientific studies validate many of these ideas. The BioAcoustic story pursues the significance of pitch, shape, and graphic pattern that can be found when we analyze our voice components. We can see the shapes created by many pitches in a voiceprint and a graphic representation of patterns hidden in the spoken voice. Specific shapes, pitches and patterns convey meaning regarding our m ental and emotional health. After analyzing sound in our body, Part Two describes Sharry's experiences regarding environmental sound and its influence on us. Sharry hears sounds from astonishing sources, yielding insights that clarify physical, mental and emotional influences that we receive from unexpected sources. Understanding these relationships enables us to balance and harmonize our energies with the ever -changing array of environmental frequencies. Environmental and vibrational influences have sur prising effects on us. The curious person interested in music, healing, medicine, color therapy, astrology, math or science will have to hold on to their seats, and get ready for some ideas that change their view of reality! Sharry retains many sound secr ets in hopes that you might come to Sound Health for software, evaluations and education. Obviously not all her secrets are revealed in this book, but many are explained in Part Two which are bound to give you a new view of the world from a sound perspecti ve. These ideas and concepts are useful in alternative healing therapies and give us valuable information to make better decisions on music selections . Finally, this information enables us to use sound to ac hieve inner harmony and balance amidst a world of frequencies that can assault our harmony. 64 Chapter One The Frequency Transport System Sharry observes and experiments with frequencies to determine which patterns of sounds support the body, while easing discomfort and problematic symptoms. After observing countless voiceprints she has constructed theories to explain the pitches displayed in the voiceprints. Sharry refines her pr actices through trial-and-error and devises reproducible methods and processes. These methods are based on novel, yet an cient , foundational concepts. Two concepts are widely used as foundational building blocks in Sharry's work. The first is that energy can be expressed as a frequency or wavelength. It does not matter if the frequency or wave is audible. The second premis e is that energy and information are exchanged on waves, which then can be studied through the looking glass of sound. First Building Block : Energy can be Expressed as Frequencies Frequency encompasses more than audible sound. If we enlarge our perspective to take in the fullest possible view of our vibrational world, then frequency can be just about anything...an angle, electromagnetic energy, thoughts and feelings, shapes, or language. If we have a number for the 'frequency,' such as an angle of 45 degrees, we can start to build data.50 Let's delve into greater detail about t his broader perspective of frequency. Whenever an electric charge oscillates or is accelerated, a disturbance of electric and magnetic fields pr opagates outward. This disturbance is called an electromagnetic wave.51 50 Alexjander, S usan. www.oursounduniverse.com 51 www.answers.com/topic/electromagnetic -radiation 65 Electromagnetic radiation is classified according to the frequency of the wave. Types of waves include (in order of increasing frequency) : radio waves , microwaves , infrared radiation , visible light , ultraviolet radiation , X-rays and gamma rays . Of these, radio waves have the longest wavelengths and Gamma rays have the shortest. The eye senses a small window of frequencies, called the visible spectrum of light. In theory, any electromagnetic radiation can be detected by its heating effect. This method has been used to detect radiation from x - rays to radio. The frequency of a sound wave is given in cycles pe r second. As frequency increases the crests and troughs get tighter packed and the pitch of the sound gets higher. As frequency decreases the wavelengths get longer - crests and troughs are spread out more; associated sound is lower in pitch. The scientis t, doctor and author, Dr. Robert Becker, writes in Cross Currents , All of the possible frequencies of electromagnetic waves or fields can be put onto an electromagnetic spectrum, starting with the slowest frequency and going to the highest. The electromag netic spectrum is usually pictured as a line that increases from zero on the left - to trillions of cycles per second on the right. About three -fourths across the frequency spectrum is something that we are familiar with - light.52 The spectrum ranging fro m electric li ghts to magnetic fields can be mapped along a frequency continuum. Dr. Becker continue s, This vibrational spectrum is produced by the movement of electrons and has the same characteristics as the Earth's magnetic field, radio waves and X -rays... In summary, magnetic and electromagnetic fields have energy, carry information and are produced by electrical currents. When we talk about electrical currents flowing in living organisms, we also imply that they are producing magnetic fields that extend outside of the body and can be influenced by external magnetic fields as well.53 Electromagnetic energy falls into categories, just like elements on the Periodic Chart are grouped into categories. Sound healers group the 52 Becker, Robert, Dr. Cross Currents, The Perils of Electropollution, The Promise of Electromedicine , Penguin Group: New York, 1990, pg. 69 53 Becker, Robert, Dr. Cross Cu rrents, The Perils of Electropollution, The Promise of Electromedicine, Penguin Group: New York, 1990, pg. 69. 66 categories into octaves. An oct ave is an interval of two musical notes, in which one frequency is half the cycles per second of the other. This is how octaves are created - starting with 100 cycles per second: A tone an octave below is created by dividing the frequency in half and getting 50 cycles per second. A tone another octave below has a frequency of 25 cycles per second. A tone, another octave lower, vibrates at 12.5 cycles per second. A tone, yet another octave lower, creates a frequency of 6.25 cycles per second. Usua lly the human ear cannot hear below approximately 20 cycles a second. However, a frequency below 20 cycles per second is in the frequency range associated with brain waves, which has been associated with various states of consciousness. Let's go the other way and raise the initial frequency by octaves. Let's start at 20,000 cycles per second (the highest sound that people hear) and raise this pitch by octaves. Each new octave is above our hearing range. As we increase the frequency by octaves the speed of the wave increases and eventually matches the speed of radio waves, TV waves, microwaves and X - rays. After we increase the frequency 40 octaves, frequencies are now measured in angstroms, or millions of cycles per second. These high octaves are measured as light! Energies can be aligned on a spectrum, going from the slowest cycles per second to the fastest. Categories of frequencies are grouped by octaves. Frequencies th at correspond to brain waves can be increased. Each octave serves a specific function in the body. Physicists sometimes object to combining these energies in one spectrum, because some energy exhibits wave qualities and other energy has characteristics of both waves and particles.54 This argument dates back to the 1600s when Christiaan Huygens and Isaac Newton proposed competing theories of light. Light was thought either to consist of waves (Huygens) or particles (Newton). Through the work of Albert Einstein , Louis de Broglie and many others, current scientific theory suggests that all particles have a wave nature 67 (and vice versa). In different contexts, because of mass , energy or frequency, s ome matter seems more particle -like than wave -like. In other contexts such as reduced energy, the same matter demonstrates more wave -like than particle -like qualities.55 Author David Tame documents that when ultrasonic sound vibrates a glass rod it causes the rod to produce both heat and light. This infers that sound energy is capable of becoming both heat and light.56 To further demonstrate the relationship of vibrations on the electromagnetic spectrum Tame cites the work of scientist, Maxwell, who demonst rated that magnetism and electricity were really aspects of the same force.57 He hints that we should be able to convert all form s of energy into any other. Sound healers simply organize energies according to the frequencies, regardless of characterist ics of waves and particles. Sharry groups octaves into c frequencies , bioelectrical frequencies , neurotransmissions , biochemicals (amino acids, hormones, enzymes, vitamins, minerals ), emotional frequencies, structural frequencies (bones, muscles and ligaments) , and neurophysical frequencies (nervous system). Second Building Block : Energy and Information are exchanged via Wave Frequency Interactions All subatomic particles vibrate. Lynne McT aggart, author of The Field, The Quest for the Sec ret Force of the Universe , describes these vibrations. Much like the undulations of the sea or ripples on a pond, the waves on a subatomic level are represented by periodic 55 At the close of the 19th century, the case that matter was made of particulate objects or atoms , was well establ ished. Electricity was understood to consist of particles called electrons . It was understood that much of nature was made of particles. At the same time, waves were well understood, together with wave phenomena such as diffraction and interference . Light was believed to be a wave. By the turn of the 20th century, problems emerged. Albert Einstein 's analysis of the photoelectric effect in 1905 demonstrated that light also possessed particle -like properties. Later on, the diffraction of electrons would be confirmed, thus showing that electrons m ust have wave -like properties in addition to particle properties. This confusion over particle versus wave properties was eventually resolved with quantum mechanics in the first half of the 20th century, which ultimat ely explained wave -particle duality. It provided a single unified theoretical framework for understanding that all matter may have characteristics associated with particles and waves. Wikipedia 56 Tame, David.

A classic sideways S - sine curve, like a j ump rope being held at both ends and being wiggled around, represents them.58 The vibrations of subatomic particles resemble sound waves. James Oschman,59 a vibratory medicine author, writes that physical contact (between two molecules) is not as signifi cant as wave and vibrational interactions. Molecular communications can be compared to the interactions of tuning fork frequencies. At an atomic scale, physical contact between two molecules has less meaning than the ways that they interact energetically. For example, as a hormone approaches a receptor, the electronic structures of both molecules begin to change. Bonds blend, twist and stretch; parts rotate and wiggle. The orientation and shape of the molecules change so that the active site of the hormone can approach the active site of the receptor. This recognition of a specific hormone by a receptor depends on resonant vibratory interactions, comparable to the interactions of tuning forks.60 Oschman says that the interaction of cells is characterized by the vibratory influences that they share. Waves carry energy and information. A TV remote controller, a radio and a telephone utilize waves to carry information. Like Oschman, many sound healers believe that waves or frequencies carry information within our bodies. Information is exchanged through wave interactions. McTagga rt postulates, One of the most important aspects of waves is that they are encoders and carriers of information. When two waves are in phase, and overlap each other, technically cal led interference' - the combined amplitude of the waves is greater than each individua l's amplitude. The signal gets stronger. This amounts to an imprinting or exchange of information - called constructive 58 McTaggart, Lynne.

He has worked in major research labs around the world, including Cambridge University in England, Case -Western Reserve University, the University of Copenhagen, Northwestern University, and the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole.

Interference patterns amount to a constant accumulation of information... and waves have a virtually infinite capacity for storage.61 These experiments verify an important piece of Sharry's process - information to bring the body back into harmony can be carried via biofrequencies. McTagg art proposes that studies of waves have a broader impact than first meets the eye. Everything that has ever happened in our world is through wave interference encoding.62 She adds, The real currency of the universe - the very reason for its stability - is an exchange of energy.63 In summary, two concepts are foundational premises for BioAcoustics: 1. Energy can be expressed as frequency . Different energies correspond to different frequencies. 2. Energy and information are exchanged via wave interactio ns. Brain W aves According to the traditional view, people associate sounds with their ears and limit the exclusive realm of sound to hearing . Sharry believes the influence of sound has far greater impact. To understand the complexity of how sound has such a potent effect on us, we will explore different methods whereby sound (such as the frequencies of our voice ) is transported throughout the body. We will begin this exploration in the brain. Brian Butterworth combines his expertise in cognitive neuro science and his broad knowledge of mathematics in his book What Counts, How Every Brain is Hardwired for Math. He likens the brain to an intricate calculator which sends and receives information throughout the body. He determined that our biology and brai n are hardwired for math.64 The body's math is expressed as frequency. Frequency is said 61 McTaggart, Lynne. The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, Harpers Collins Publishers: N.Y. , 2002. pg. 26. 62 McTaggart, Lynne. The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, Harpers Collins Publishers: N .Y,, 2002. pg. 35. 63 McTaggart, Lynne. The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, Harpers Collins Publishers: N .Y., 2002. pg. 36. 64 Butterworth, Brian. What Counts, How Every Brain is Hardwired for Math. Free Press: N.Y., 1999. 70 to be the language of the body because it easily converts to math. Jeffrey Thompson, a sound healing scientist, said , The brain's internal communication system, its la nguage, is based on frequency. 65 Our body knows how to interpret frequencies as easily as we understand the meaning of words. All frequencies can be correlated to brainwaves, by cutting the cycles per second (creating octaves ) in half until it is in the range of brain waves. The brain translates frequencies that are in the range of brain waves and appropriately reroutes the vibratory information to the rest of our bodies . In the 1940s , Karl Pribram (a neurosurgeon and researcher ) theorized about the la nguage of the brain and body. Our brain primarily talks to itself and to the rest of the body - not with words or images or even bits or chemical impulses, but in the language of wave interference; the language of phase, amplitude and frequency - the spectral domain. We perceive the world by resonating with it, getting in sync with it. To know the world is to literally be on its wavelength.66 Collective Energy Fields Not only is our brain wired to use the language of frequencies, so is the entire body, down to the very molecules. Every molecule vibrates in a characteristic way, expressing its own unique energy. This is proven with spectroscopy67 which records and measures resonant emissions and absorption of waves in molecules. Different movements within the molecule emit different frequencies.68 According to James Gimzewski, a chemist from UCLA with an extensive background in nanotechnology, Every cell has a 65 Research Behind Acoustic Brain Entrainment, pg. 8. www.neuroacoustic.org. 66 Lynne. The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force of the Uni verse, Harper Collins Publishing: N.Y., 2002. pg. 84. 67 Spectroscopy is historically referred to the use of visible light dispersed according to its wavelength, e.g. by a prism . Late r the concept was expanded to include any measurement of wavelength or frequency . Spectroscopy is used in physical and analytical chemistry to identify substances through the spectrum emitted from or absorbed by them. Wikipedia 68Spectroscopy demonstrates that the relationships between organisms and coherent vibrations in all living systems are as basic as their chemical bonds. There are two way s of altering the body's functions - by adding molecules to a system and by changing the fingerprint of the molecule. Many of the current energy therapies change the signature of molecules to create balance within the body. Davis, Dorinne. Sound Bodies t hrough Sound Therapy , Kalco Publishing: Landing, New Jersey, 2004. pg. 231. 71 frequency.69 He calculated the pitch of a cell by measuring the distance the cell wall raises and falls, and its speed or oscillation. The distance the cell wall moves determines the amplitude or the volume of the sound wave. The speed of the up -and-down movement determines the pitch. The volume of the sound wave is too low to be audible even though it is theoretically within the range of human hearing. Gimzewski pour ed alcohol on cells, which made the pitch rise. When the cell died , it gave off a low rumbling noise.70 Molecul es vibrate and emit frequencies, impac ting other molecules. In her book Sound Bodies through Sound Therapy Dorinne Davis explains how the vibration of one molecule moves throughout the body. If a molecule is charged, the vibrating interaction between molecules sets up an electromagnetic field that entrains adjacent molecules. Near by molecules respond by emitting the same electromagnetic field.71 Davis explains what happens when the vibrations of molecules impact others. As a result, the molecular movements and energy fields that are generated form collective energy systems.72 She adds, As these energetic pathways intersect, they produce coordinated energy actions, which are the foundation of processes such as thought, reproduction, excretion, and movement, among others. 73 Dorinne describes the vibration of one molecule and how it interacts and shares it s vibration with its neighbors, creating energy fields in the body. Sharry believes that some collective energy systems have constant frequencies in every person's body which she c alls frequency - equivalents or FEs. Generally , an organ has a stable stream of energy, a collective frequency. 69 Jim Gimzewski, a UCLA chemist, a leader in nanotechnology, previously worked at IBM's research laboratory in Zurich, Switzerland, where he and colleagues built a spinning mol ecular propeller 0.0000015 millimeters in diameter. 70 Wheeler, Mark. Signal Discovery? http://www.smithsonianmag.si.edu/smithsonian/issues04/mar04/phenomena.html 71 Davis, Dorinne. Sound Bodies through Sound Therapy , Kalco Publishing: Landing, New Jersey , 2004 pg. 253. 72 Davis, Dorinne. Sound Bodies through Sound Therapy, Kalco Publishing: Landing, New Jersey, 2004. pg. 253. 73 Davis, Dorinne. Sound Bodies through Sound Therapy, Kalco Publishing: Landing, New Jersey, 2004. pg. 230. 72 One-by-one Sharry discovered and tes ted each frequency -equivalent for muscles, tissues and organs. All bones are composed of nearly identical chemical elements. She hypothe sizes that each el ement in the Periodic Chart of Elements has its own signature frequency. Since the frequencies of the component elements are consistent, each bone has a u niversal frequency. Continuing with this line of reasoning, if each element has its own signature fre quency, then each bio-chemical (made up of elements), toxin, pathogen, herb and medicine also has a signature frequency.74 Individual t ones of each organ vary slightly. Sharry has created extensive catalogs of frequency -equivalents for healthy organs, tissues, muscles and body systems. Impact of Frequency -Equivalent s Experiments show that a person who receiv es the frequency formula for niacin, experiences skin flushing. If he ingests niacin , he has the same reaction. In an analogous situation, people s uffering from high blood pressure respond posit ively to drug treatment but research proves that meditation can reduce blood pressure as well . As the reader may well recall, Sharry's earlier work provided evidence of the reduction of blood pressure when she vocalized certain sounds . Clearly the human body is a marvelous, mysterious machine that responds on many levels to different energies or treatments. French doctor and scientist, Jacques Benveniste conducted experiments with low frequency waves from ele ctromagnetic signals producing changes similar to pharmacological chemicals.75 The low electromagnetic radiation of these signals effectively took the place of chemicals.76 McTagga rt writes that, Benveniste demonstrated that you could transfer specific mo lecular signals simply by using an amplifier and electromagnetic coils. Four years later, he was able to record and replay these signals using a multimedia computer. Over thousands of experiments, B enveniste and Didier Guillonnet (an engineer ) 74 Valance electro ns govern chemical reactions. As they are moving energy perhaps they account for their cell frequency. 75 He recorded the sounds of the cells with a purpose -designed transducer and a computer equipped with a sound card. 76 Less than 20 kilohertz 73 recorded the activity of a molecule on a computer and replayed it to a biological system, ordinarily sensitive to that substance. In every instance the biological system has been fooled into thinking that it has an interaction with the substance itself and has acted a ccordingly, initiating a biological chain reaction just as it would in the actual presence of the genuine molecule.77 Once again this study demonstrates the power of waves to carry information and impact us significantly. Negative emotions, toxins and pat hogens produce frequencies. They create disharmony and spread disorder through the same process of resonance that spreads harmony. The body becomes stressed when harmonic frequency patterns are disrupted in body organs and systems. If the collective vibrat ion of an organ slips or escalates, disease can result. BioAcoustical analysis and sound formulations can support one's health. Some of the things that affect our internal frequencies include : medicine, homeopathic remedies, herbs, vitamins , heating pad s and ice packs (Heat is a form of frequency. Temperature varies in a manner similar to pitches). Medical treatments already influence the frequency systems of the body. M edical treatments utilizing vibrating waves include X -rays, sonograms, ultrasounds, MRIs, CAT scans and heart pacemakers. Frequency treatments are already an important part of the medical field, but they are not categorized as vibratory treatment. Energy Transportion Systems As we have seen, one basic BioAcoustic concept is that wave pat terns carry information that is delivered to all parts of the body in various ways. Understanding the different pathways of body communication enhances our comprehension of how Sharry uses sound to impact the body . Sound therapy works effectively with de af people , suggesting that sound enters the body through other means than just our ears. It also follows that there are more receptors for sound than hearing alone. 77 McTaggar t, Lynne. The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, Harpers Collins Publishers: N.Y., 2002. pg. 68. 74 Sound can en ter the body via the skin. N eurons78 process and transmit information in the nervous system by vibrational signaling . Some neurons throughout the body specialize in responding to sound, light, touch and other stimuli and then send these signals to the brain. When music is played near us, sound waves hit our skin. Sound receptors in our skin receive the vibrations of the music and then pass it to the nerves. Dr. Tomatis commented on the effects of sound on our skin. The skin is richly supplied with sound recep tors principally in the face, the anterior part of the thorax, the abdomen, the inside of the arms, the palms of the hands, inside of the thighs and legs, as well as the soles of the feet. These places interpret pressures made on the skin by sound waves, e ven when they are below the threshold of conscious awareness. It makes sense that when someone does not want to listen to something that he may turn his back or step aside, so that he presents the parts of his body that have fewer sound receptors.79 The sound impulses enter through the skin and travel on nerve pathways to our brain. An average human child has approximately one hundred billion neurons by the age of two. The neurons are connected together through a network of dendrites that conduct electrica l impulses.80 An average adult has approximately one trillion dendrites that can total almost 10,000 miles in length. Communication (of information carried on waves) in our bodies is clearly important. A system of pulses and body rhythms creates a communic ation system. Hazrat In ayat Khan, a Sufi teacher who teaches about the impact of music, says, A person not only hears sounds through his ears, but through every pore of his body. Sound permeates his entire being , and according to its particular influence , it either slows down 78 Neurons are responsive cells in the nervous system that process and transmit information by electrochemical signaling . They are the core components of the brain , the vertebrate spinal cord , the invertebrate ventral nerve cord , and the peripheral nerves. A number of specialized types of neurons exist: sensory neurons respond to touch, sound, light and numerous other stim uli affecting cells of the sensory organs that then send signals to the spinal cord and brain. Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord and cause muscle contractions and affect glands . Neurons respond to stimuli and communicate the presence of stimuli to the central nervous system which processes that information and sends responses to other parts of the body for action. 79Dr. Tomatis. The Ear and the Voice, The Scarecrow Press: Maryland, Toronto, Oxford, 1987. Translated into English in 2005. pg. 84. 80A dendrite is a tiny filament of nerve endings wafting back and forth, like shafts of wheat in a slow breeze - communicating with other neuron s sending and receiving their own electromagnetic impulses. McTaggart, Lynne. The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, Harper Collins Publishing: New York, 2002. pg. 88. 75 or quickens the rhythms of the blood circulation; it either wakens the nervous system or soothes it. It arouses the listener to greater passions or it calms him by bringing peace.81 The frequencies and rhythms that surround us affect our nerves and interact with the rhythm of our heartbeat. Our heartbeat and pulse can be likened to rhythmic music from a loud speaker that encourages one to sway and dance in a unified rhythm. Slower music clearly produces a different experience than mus ic with rapid beats. The scientist, Parncutt , presented evidence that people perceive music on felt -pulse patterns and that the perception of rhythm is not an event based process, but an interval period -based process, with pulses simply serving as event m arkers demarcating rhythmic intervals.82 We even use pulses to perceive music. The nervous system is like a two -way highway, communicating information to and from the brain and body . This creates a feedback system that is crucial in the body. If someo ne cuts a finger, the brain knows and immediately the proper bio -chemical arrives on the scene to clot and repair the wound. The brain and nervous systems transmit this communication via frequencies. Sharry believes that otoacoustic emissions are at least on e way the brain receives information encoded in frequencies and rhythm regarding body maintenance and r epair. Her reasoning is simple - she has been able to listen to sounds that seem to be coming from the side of a person's head. If she can tell what a pe rson's health issues are from these sounds, surely the brain can too. At http://www. otoemissions.org or http://www.oae.it there are over 3000 research articles on otoacoustic emissions ranging from the science of hearing to clinical applications of these t iny frequencies. The brain understands what body repairs are needed, whether it is from otoacoustic emissions, the nervous system or another method. In addition to being able to self diagnose, the body reorganizes according to internal information. We se e the results of a system when we watch a cut heal. 81 Khan, Inayat, Hazrat. The Music of Life , Omega Publishing: New Lebanon, N.Y., 1983. pg. 274. 82 1994 study by Parncutt, quoted by: Thaut, Michael. Rhythm, Music and the Brain: Scientific Found ations and Clinical Application, Routledge, N .Y., 2005. pg. 7. 76 Once the brain has diagnosed a problem, how does it insure that repairs are carried out? Sharry believes that the brain uses frequency signals to orchestrate repairs. Our brain constantly sends impulse patterns, measured as brain -wave frequencies, to the body by way of nerve pathways . A brainwave is like a passenge r on the nerve's subway system. Dorinne Davis adds, Nerve impulses transmit energy from one part of the body to another. The energy created c an be measured through electrical fields generated during the transmission of nerve impulses.83 Later in Chapter Four, Processing Frequencies, methods are described in which the brain creates harmonic frequencies to balance and correct body frequencies th at are not in tune, otherwise known as disease or stress. For now, we will continue to explore the pathways that frequencies use to travel throughout the body. The body has numerous methods of sending energy messages other than utilizing the nervous syst em: Energy travels in the circulatory system through arteries and is delivered to the far reaches of our bodies. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that relay, amplify and modulate signals between a neuron and another cell. Individual cells of the body vibrate, influencing each other's movement and create a continuous vibratory network. Waves from our breath , pulse and heartbeat exhibit frequency, rhythm and volume in many parts of the body. When we speak, our vocal cavity vibrates, setting up a resonance that can be felt in many structures of the body. The body has subtle energy channels, called meridians, which connect body systems, organs and glands. Acupuncture and many other healing modalities utilize this energy transportation system. There are points on the body called acupressure points, which support the flow of subtle energy. For example, there are acupressure points on our feet, hands and ears that conne ct with each meridian. Energy from meridians connects to our organs and glands.84 83 Davis, Dorinne. Sound Bodies through Sound Therapy , Kalco Publishing: Landing, New Jersey, 2004. pg. 260. 84Paul Nogiers, a French neurologist became involved with ear acupuncture in the early 1950's when a woman said she had back pain for years that was cured by a woman who burnt her ear and the pain has been gone since. Dr. Nogiers' scientific curiosity was aroused. He searched for 77 Bone conduction of sound occurs between the inner ear and the bones of the skull . This is why a person's voice sounds different when it is recorded and played back. Bone conduction amplifies lower frequencies, so most people hear their own voice in a lower pitch than it actually is.85 Every organ in our body is exposed to a constant stream of vibrations, pitches, rhythms and energy information. Various types of energy that correlate to frequencies and rhythms from our body constantly interact. From these observations a new science reveals itself and is just waiting to be expl ored. In summary , frequency, volume of frequency and rhythm can be transported through the body in a variety of means via: Ears Nerves Circulatory System Neurotransmitters Breathing Pulse /Heart Beat Brain waves Cellular networks - the vibration of one ce ll affecting neighbors Meridians Our voice Skin Bones All of the se frequencies and rhythms can affect each other. What a complex , dazzling matrix of music and information ! The Nervous System The nervous system is an important frequency transport system. It is a network of specialized cells that communicate information about a person's surroundings and internal information. This vibratory other areas on the ear that might relieve ailments and discovered that the ear has points communicating with the rest of the body. After listening to his lecture, the Chinese pursue d the subject, using the Red army as subjects. They developed a map of the ear, with points that connect to other parts of the body to provide pain relief. 85 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_conduction 78 infor mation is processed and causes reaction s in other parts of the body.86 When on e traces the nervous system, it is easy to understand its connections to frequencies and our voices. The Central Nervous System is exactly what the name implies. It is the central system with all of the other peripheral nerves feeding off it. The periphe ral nerves are part of the peripheral nervous system.87 The Central Nervous System is composed of the brain , spinal cord and associated nerves that control voluntary and involuntary acts. In other words t he Central Nervous System controls physical body processes that you do on your own (moving your arm) and those you do without having to tell your body to do it (like breathing). The peripheral nervous system sends information to the central nervous system. It senses signals from the external environment (sensory -somatic nervous system) and from the internal environment (autonomic nervous system). The autonomic nervous system is divided into the parasympathetic (conserves energy and repairs the body during r est) and sympathetic nervous systems (mobilizes the body during activity and \"fight or flight\" responses). The parasympathetic nervous system is regulated by the vagus nerve that runs along side of the spinal cord. The vocal cords lie within the vagus ne rve bundle. The vibrations of the vagus nerve and the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which controls the vocal chords, interact due to their close proximity. When t he vagus nerve sends impulses that interact with our voca l chords it may regulate our v oices. The voice can access and entrain to the frequencies traveling through the nervous system via the vagus nerve. It is logical that o ur vocal chords can reflect the vibrational status of many body functions, reflecting health issues. 86 The nervous system is divided broadly into two cat egories: the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system . Neurons generate and conduct impulses between and within the two systems. The peripheral nervous system is composed of sensory neurons and the neurons that connect them to the nerve cord , spinal cord and brain , which make up the central nervous system . In response to stimuli, sensory neurons generate and propagate signals to the central nervous system , which then processes and conducts signals back to the muscles and glands . The interaction of different neurons form neural circuits that regulate an organism's perception of the world and what is going on with its body, thus regulating its beh avior. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system 87 Dr. Standly.com 79 Frequency information in the voi ce could impact the vagus nerve which sends waves with information to the brain. In summary, information in the body travels to the brain through the twelve cranial nerves. The vagus nerve, the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the vocal chor ds play a major role. The central nervous system is like our body's Internet, allowing information from millions of body processes to collaborate. F requencies interact, like colors combine in a kaleidoscope. The brain's response to incoming information goe s back via the same nerve network to organs and tissues to trigger appropriate action. The Perineural Connective System The perineural connective tissue system (perineural meaning around a nerve) is another information -transportation system in the body. With further exploration we learn that, The perineural tissue cells surround each neuron in the brain, accounting for more than half of the brain's cells. There are more than twice as many perineural cells in the brain as there are neurons. These perineur al cells follow every nerve to its endpoint. Until recently, scientists thought that these cells only had a supportive structure. Now, it is known that they conduct information. The individual cells vibrate and affect each other's movement. Resembling a ri pple effect, a vibration is passed, cell -to- cell in a continuous vibratory network. 88Dr. Becker gives us an imaginary picture to see h ow the vibrations of the cells a ffect each other, in the brain nerves cells can be likened to raisins in a pudding of per ineural cells.89 The central nervous system controls body sensations and provides feedback regarding various activities within the body. It responds quickly to stimulus. The perineural cells form the protective layer surrounding the peripheral nerves.90 In contrast, the perineural cells responds slowly and more globally. Scientists are discovering other pathways of cell -to-cell communication. Stuart Hameroff, an anesthesiologist from the 88 McTaggart, Lynne. The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, Harper Collins Publishing: N.Y., 2002, pg. 92. 89 Becker, Robert. Cross Currents, The Perils of Electropol lution, The Promise of Electromedicine: the Perils of Electropollution , Penguin Group: N.Y., N.Y., 1990, pg. 63. 90http://www.copewithcytokines.de/cope.cgi?key=perineurial%20cells 80 University of Arizona, discovered that microtubules, the scaffolding of cells, are exceptional conductors of pulses. A vibration in one microtubule affects its neighbors and resonates in unison. 91 In summary, the structures of the perineural and central nervous systems are markedly different. The central nervous system is a fast method of transferring information, w hile the perineural is a slower but very accurate transmission mechanism . The information from the perineural system and other cell -to-cell vibratory networks spread s slower throughout the entire body versus the central nervous system, which quickly sends information to specific places.92 Digital and Analog Sounds Sounds, or data transmissions, can be coded or packaged into electrical signals in two methods: digital or analog. Analog technology t ranslates audio (such as the human voice ) into electronic pulses that are continuo us waves and correspond in magnitude to the quantities t hey represent. For example, old er analog phones convert sound waves into corresponding electrical waves . The voice bounces off a membrane in the speaker, which vibrates much like hitting a snare drum with your fingers. This vibration transforms into electrical signals and then travels on copper wires to another phone . A magnet in the receiving speaker converts the energy into sound. The complete signal is transferred in wave like form. The analog systems use a continuous range of values t o represent information.93 All frequencies are a wave -like form. The speed of transfer is slower than digital because it is direct current. Audiophiles argue that analog process is more precise than the digital system of sound transfer. Analog data transfer is slow and not capable of transferring large amounts of data, but it is extremely precise. In another example, all shades in a film -photograph are duplicated and merge smoothly into neighboring shades. This is analogous to analog. 91 McTaggart, Lynne. The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force of the Univer se, Harper Collins Publishing, New York: 2002, pg. 92. 92 Davis, Dorinne. S ound Bodies through Sound Therapy , Kalco Publishing: Landing, New Jersey, 2004. pg. 262. 93 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_recording_vs._digital_recording 81 Digital, a binary for mat, breaks a signal into a binary code and audio data is represented by a series of 1s and 0s. These signals carry electronic pulses, where 0 represents pulse -not present and 1 represents pulse -active. The number of pulses per unit creates a signal code . This process has similarities to Morse code. It also resembles the rhythm component of music. Computers operate in a similar way. This method is extremely fast and transfers large amounts of information.94 A digital photograph consists of information separated into groups. All shades are not reproduced, but the averaged information in each group is printed. 95 In the audio digital process, sound waves are divided into groups and average d. This average frequency represents a group. The digital data often represents electro -magnetic signal s, such as electric ity, radio wave s, microwave s, or infrared signals. These signals can be sent on copper wires , optical fibers , wireless communication channels or storage media . LCD televisions, cell phones, CDs and computer screens use this process. Davis describes the digital system in our bodies. The central nervou s system uses neurons conducting impulses from place to place, as electrical impulses. It employs a digital sound format to provide high - speed, high -volume information.96 When we talk in person, we exchange analog sound. When sound initially hits the ear drum, the waveform is analog, but the brain sends signals in digital form using the central nervous system. The brain digitizes the analog frequencies that the body hears. Our world utilizes both analog and digital communications. Sending information usi ng analog methods is less complex and was used earlier in history. Early phones transmitted sounds in an analog format. Today a digital process is used on our phones. Computers initially transferred data in an analog format, but later evolved to digital. A nalog TV signals in the USA converted to digital in 2009. Dr. Becker, who was twice nominated for a Nobel Prize, believes that 94 Becker, Robert, Dr. Cross Currents, The Perils of Electropollution, The Promise of Electromedicine , Penguin Group: New York, 1990, pg. 59. 95 Businessdictionary.com 96 Davis, Dorinne. Sound Bodies through Sound Therapy. Kalco Publishing: Landing, New Jersey, 2004. pg. 26 0. 82 early -evolved body systems evolved in a similar progression, first using analog frequenc ies and later developing digital formats for communication .97 According to Dr. Becker t oday , many sophisticated computers are hybrids, containing analog and digital components. Our brain operates in a similar manner as hybrid computers do. The central nervous system sends information in digital form, and the perineural connective cell system sends information from the brain in analog form. Dr. Becker98 has substantiated an analog current system found hidden within the central nervous system.99 The perineural system cells send information in a slo w wave formation in an analog format and are unable to transmit large amounts of data. Although the speed and quantity of wave forms is limited, analog format works best for precise control.100 The perineural cell system is activated prior to nerve impulse s and appears to make actual decisions and regulates one's level of consciousness.101 Dr. Becker continues, Analog data transmission and control system, located in the perineural cells transmits information by means of the flow of a semiconducting DC elect rical current that sense injury and controls repair, and it may serve as the morphogenetic field itself.102 The determination of the best method to transfer sound is far from complete. There are benefits from using both methods. Many sound healing processe s, such as the Tomatis103 method use digital sound 97 Becker, Robert, Dr. Cross Currents, The Perils of Electropollution, The Promise of Electromedicine , Penguin Group: New York, 1990, pg. 59. 98 Dr. Robert Becker is a pioneering researcher in he field of electricity and regeneration, an orthopedic sur geon and a professor at NY State University, Upstate Medical Center and at the Louisiana Sate University Medical Center. He authored The Body Electric and Cross Currents, The Perils of Electropollution, The Promise of Electromedicine . 99 Becker, Robert, Dr. Cross Currents, The Perils of Electropollution, The Promise of Electromedicine, Penguin Group: New York, 1990, pg. 62. 100 Davis, Dorinne.

Tomatis (January 1 , 1920 -December 25, 2001) was an internationally known otolaryngologist , and inventor. He received his Doctorate in Medicine from the Paris School of Medicine. His alternative medicine theories of hearing and listening are known as the Tomatis method. His method began to help professional singers based on his idea that hearing is the ro ot 83 and work through the central nervous system. Other sound healing systems, including BioAcoustics, utilize analog sound and the perineural connective system to send energy information. Each system offers diff erent strengths that may be explained in part by the digital versus analog transfer process. Specialties for Tomatis auditory therapy include learning disabilities, problems with speech, language acquisition and development, brain dominance, handedness, singing, hearing and behavioral problems. Specialties for BioAcoustics include improving muscle tone, reversing trauma, stroke rehabilitation, controlling proteins and receptors and absorption of nutrients. BioAcoustics also excels at alleviating symptoms of chronic fatigue, fybromyalgia, stroke, autism and others. With additional research more information will become available on the effects of digital versus analog communication in our bodies. A s we become more sophisticated, we will better understand w hich energy transport system is best for specific health problems. Sharry cautiously refrains from using brainwave frequencies in digital format with the exception of using FE's to kill pathogens .104 A CD uses digital format. Sharry experiences better succe ss with analog and she found a few digital frequencies to be potentially stressful to the body. To illustrate this point Sharry associates a low frequency with prost ate cancer. cause of a variety of ailments. His Listening Test and Electronic Ear therapy alleviated auditory processing problems, dyslexia , learning disabilities , attention deficit disorders , autism , sensory integration and motor -skill difficulties. It is also claimed to have helped fight depression , learn foreign languages faster, develop better communication skills and improve creativity and on - the-job performance. Some musicians, singers and actors found it helpful in fine -tuning their skills. 104 James Marshall, musician and actor, wor ked with Sharry using frequencies to counter the swine flu in his piece, Le Ciel. 84 Chapter Two The Voiceprint Like music, our speaking voice is a measurable arrangement of sounds. Our voice s' tonal qualities plus the sounds of our language dance together. Language contains discordant and harsh sounds as well as harmonic sounds. Each word contains individual sound units called phonemes. A phoneme is the most basic unit of an uttered sound. Fast Fourier transformer devices, abbreviated as FFTs, break the sound of our voice s into individual pitches and graph them. An algorithm dissect s a sequence of values into different frequencies. It can also count the number of times each pitch occurs during a period of time. This FFT analysis mathematically organizes the sounds created by phonemes. The FFTs evaluat e the pitch of each phoneme so they are effective with all languages. Any sound, including moaning, crying, laughing or nonsense syllables can be analyzed. In the time span of approximately one minute, there may be as many as 100,000 pitches sounded in our voice. Types of Voiceprints There are two variations of voiceprints used in BioAcoustic analysis. One prod uces time -domain graphs and the other creates frequency - domain graphs. Before these graphs are produced your voice is recorded. There are many programs to do this. Sharry recommends Audacity, a freeware program. The recording produces a picture. A frequ ency -domain vocal graph uses the measurement of cycles per second to record each tiny sound created by our body. All of these minute sounds combine and produce our voice. Each tiny, vertical line on this graph is an individual frequency -equivalent represen ting vibrations in our voice and body. 85 Sharry equates chemical elements and compounds with frequency - equivalents similar to molecular weights based on her research. Muscle frequencies are based on nerve interactions, while emotional frequencies are based on brain waves.105 Time Domain and Frequency Domain Voice Prints Sharry's software equates frequency -equivalent s with bio -chemicals, genetics, muscles, genomes, pathogens, nutrients, toxins and processes in the body. For example, one program graphs the frequency -equivalents of muscles, while another software program reports those frequencies associated with our eyesight. These programs relate each graphed line to an identified FE. In contrast, time -domain vocal prints create bar graphs . Each bar graph represents the number of times each pitch is sounded by phonemes. This information is used for personality profiling, group dynamics, matchmaking and understanding personal actions and reactions. More detail on time -domain vocal prints will be covered in Part Three, Applications, in the nanoVoice description. 105 Fucetola, Kathy and Ralph. The Lady who Sings God. pg. 5. 86 Architecture in the Voiceprint When a voice is recorded for about two minutes and this data is inserted into a FFT program (FFTs are included in some of Sharry's software) a frequency -domain graph is produced with wave -like shapes. Frequency -Domain Voiceprints Sharry refers to shapes created by the pitches within one's voiceprint as the voice's architecture. In general, a balanced, healthy voice pattern resembles a wave, with its own uniqu e shape. After observing thousands of vocal graphs, Sharry deciphered the meaning of certain shapes within the voice's architecture . Pitches that f all within the larger wave -like shape represent healthy and harmonious frequencies. Freque ncies outside this healthy wave represent stressful and unharmonious frequencies in the body. The scattered shapes of the voiceprint , outside of the larger wave form, represent health problems. In contrast, when one is healthy the frequencies collect in the smaller, mor e unified and solid wave pattern. 87 Sharry watches the body sing its many songs and notices if any frequencies are missing or low. She then provides the missing FEs to trick the brain into delivering the m. Each person's healthy frequency range can be dif ferent. Typically , men have a lower rang e of frequencies in their voice while the range is higher for women and children. After extensive research , Sharry categorized specific architectural shapes created from voiceprints and discovered the meaning of ea ch nuance. Certain shapes in the architecture seemed to repeatedly reflect specific health issues. For example, Sharry defines shapes that correlate to the presence of toxins, pathogens, poison, inflammation, infections and more. There is a shape that sign ifies that a completely missing frequency . Listening to a missing FE tricks the brain into making the necessary item and gives it the means to repair itself. Most people would not have the motivation and perseverance to categorize the significance of subtl e detail in a voiceprint. Sharry refers to points on the vocal graph that are above the range of a person's voice as risers. Risers show frequencies that are over ly abundant, perhaps to the point of toxicity. Our bodies need balance. For example, if a person ate too many peaches he would not want any more. Similarly, too much or too little of a frequency creates unbalance in the system. In another example, w hen the frequency - equivalent of a muscle is too high, it can be tight or inflamed. Points on the graph that are low, called stringers, indicate deficient frequencies. Using BioAcoustic parameters risers and stringers identify toxins, pathogens and detect hidden stresses that may lead to disease. Fewer risers and/or stringers are indicative of bette r health. In fact, it is ideal that the voice gathers in a limited bandwidth of pitches, which resembles a waveform created by closely drawn vertical lines. When we crave a certain food, the voiceprint reflects a food 's FE (or an octave of the FE) as out of balance. Do we crave sugar because its FE helps the body to balance low adrenal energy ? Do we desire soda pop because it i s a FE that substitutes for fat digestion or do we desire a food because it has a nutrient or an FE that our body needs? 88 A balanc ed voiceprint does not look like a straight line, which would sound mechanical and monotonous. A person with this variation of a voiceprint would be in denial of the normal range of emotions. Sharry observes that people with breast cancer often have voicep rints with too narrow of a frequency range. The body requires a full range of harmonious pitches, in order to be healthy. Life apparently wants us to experience , balance and master all frequencies . A healthy span of frequencies represents the full range o f emotions, thoughts and healthy body functions . Spiritual growth is the endless expansion of successful experiences, giving a person a wider and deeper mastery of life, increasing one's vibrancy and strength of being. As one's vibratory spectrum is enriched and expanded, the intensity of illumination is increased . As the vibratory spectrum of light becomes richer, it moves towards white ligh t, containing all colors corresponding to all emotions. When we are missing frequencies, we invite lessons and peo ple that help us master situations with the same energy . After success we weave those frequencies into our internal harmony. Sharry tells us, Just as a rainbow is incomplete without its full spectrum of colors, the body needs the full spectrum of sounds to establish and maintain the perfect state of health.106 Accurate Analysis Many in physical pain have undergone extensive testing and receive no clues to the cause of the ir problem. Others are told their physical ailment is in their head. The voiceprint eliminates the guesswork of interpreting symptoms as it precisely identifies body frequencies that are out of balance and stressed. Once this science is perfected, it should be inexpensive and less invasive than many current medical testing procedures. One of the many values of a voiceprint is its ability to hone in on the root of one's symptoms. (The root cause is often the weakest point or FE on the voiceprint.) In contrast, physical pain can be misleading when one is attempting to find the root of a pr oblem. For example, one may feel back pain, yet the voiceprint reveals that the out -of- balance frequencies are from the back of the stomach. When the stressed muscles from the back of the stomach are harmonized, the 106 Edwards, Sharry. Vocal Profiling for the Professional , Sound Health: Athens, Ohio, 2002. pg.. MI -29. 89 back pain disappears. Voiceprints often provide clues for a more accurate identification and location of health issues. The voiceprint shows numerous issues in the body at one time. For example, it may show a virus, a weakened immune system and toxins in the liver. The complete frequency analys is may clarify the relationships of various health imbalances, pointing out when one issue causes or escalates another. When Sharry prepares sounds to harmonize the body she tweaks on e or two percent of a frequency which can make a difference in its poten cy. For example, the FE that counters the venom of the Brown Recluse Spider must be accurate. If it is tweaked as little as . 06 hertz it will not work. A frequency tonic can be m olded to reflect tiny frequency var iations that are needed on an individual ba sis. It is recommended u sing a trained BioAouctic practitioner to interpret complex data to create your sonic preparations. Prevention Harmonic imbalances are present before chemical imbalances are created in the body. Timely voiceprints predict the o nset of physical symptoms. An illness may be predicted as much as 30 days in advance, allowing one to seek preventative action. Each pitch, as measured by the number of cycles per second, displays whether or not a harmonic imbalance is in the warning stag e or is a physical issue. Frequency imbalances in the range of 0 to 64 cycles per second are used as predictive data. These slower vibratory cycles have not solidified into a physical problem in our body. These vibrations are still pliable, easily molded a nd harmonized. Problematic stringers and risers that range between 65 to 512 cycles per second represent current physical health issues. Stringers and risers with wavelengths from 513 cycles per second and higher reflect long term, chronic physical issues. The highest frequencies are related to long -term physical conditions. 90 Predictive, Current and Long -Term Frequency Ranges In mystic circles involution is the process of spirit crystallizing into matter. Evolution is the opposite, the process of spiri t releasing out of matter. Frequency -domain voiceprints separate pitches by frequency , reflecting how far disease has manifested into matter, mirroring the process of involution. The stages of illness follow a pattern: we create unharmonious thoughts and f eelings; over time the octaves of these disharmonies crystallize into soft tissues and bones (and become disease). A s the frequencies increase in speed, the disharmony becomes more permanent. Evolution, the reverse process, loosens the spirit from the disharmonious anchor of matter. Evolution is accomplished by maintaining inner harmony and peaceful feelings. The great psychic, Edgar Casey, believed that matter and energy involve and evolve. He said, The spirit is life. Mind is the builder. Physica l is the result.107 Cayce believed that our thoughts shape our characteristics, personality, emotional habits and physical health . 107 Ritber ger, Carol, PHD. What Color is Your Personality? Hay House: Carlsbad, CA., 2000. pg. 23. 91 The Mind -Body Link Traditional medicine views people as sophisticated biological machines. Clearly , the human being is mor e than flesh and blood. There are deep relationship s between th e body, mind and spirit - each affects the others. Voiceprints reveal frequencies corresponding to physica l, mental and emotional aspects and relationships among these energetic layers. At ever y moment we create frequencies. Through resonance, vibrations ripple through every level of our being. To explain how resonance works, picture a string on a violin. Resonance occurs when a passive string vibrates after a different string (that is the same or an octave ) is vibrated . In a classic example , one tuning fork is mounted on a wooden box. If another similar tuning fork is struck, placed on the box and then muted, the un -struck mounted fork will be heard. A unison or octave wi ll provoke the largest r esponse as there is maximum likeness in vibratory motion. Other resonance links occur at intervals of three and five notes apart, though with less effect.108 The frequencies in our body produce additional ripple effect tones, the strongest of these being octaves. Other ripple effect tones are intervals of thirds and fifths higher than the original frequency . A more detailed description of resonance is presented in chapter three (Musical Concepts within the Body) of Part Two. When we feel an emotion, we create a specific electro -magnetic wave. After testing countless voiceprints, Sharry correlated frequency -equivalents to specific emotions. The frequency - equivalent s for emotions are universal. Our emotions are affected through octave resonance from bra inwaves, and frequencies of organs, tissues, muscles and bones. Conversely, our feelings also create vibratory responses on all of these levels and octaves. All frequencies in our physical bodies are connected to our emotions through resonance. Emotions a nd th oughts weave in and out of our being all day and interact with our internal harmonic structures. This harmony , or lack 108 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance 92 of it, impacts our physical bodies. Negative or stressed feelings create disharmony and imbalances in ou r body . If a frequency is o ut of balance, the octaves of this same frequency are not coherent either. Due to the phenomena of resonance, voiceprints can reveal the underlying emotional causes of physical ailments . A voiceprint not only tells us what is amiss in our physical body, bu t it also gives the specific negative emotion associated with the condition. For example, anger escalates blood pressure. Sharry recalls a young boy with behavioral problems directed toward his mother. After taking a voiceprint, Sharry detected a frequenc y denoting his stressed emotion. She created a formula of sounds to counter this frequency imbalance. His behavior improved for a short while and then reverted back with no sustained success . Next Sharry looked for something deeper in his voiceprint to fin d the root cause of the emotional issue. An exact octave below the boy's stressed emotion was a frequency associated with a deficiency of vitamin B -12. After listening to appropriate frequency -equivalents , the vitamin B -12 deficiency cleared. His emotion al issues with his mother permanently disappeared. Sharry concluded that the root cause of his emotional problem was a nutritional imbalance that triggered his negative emotions. We are familiar with the adage, mind over matter, but vocal profiling show s us that matter over mind is equally valid. For example, we understand tha t worry contributes to an ulcer b ut an ulcer produces a Frequency -Equivalent that supports worry, too. The link between our health and our emotions is a two -way street. Voiceprin ts Change as our Words do The information contained in a voiceprint changes each time we record a voice sample. As our words, thoughts and emotions shift during various discussions, so does the information revealed in the voiceprint. Numerous voiceprints are taken to get a complete health profile. A problematic frequency may occur only once or it may show up over and over again, signifying that a critical issue is present. Repeated voiceprints document how often problematic frequencies occur. 93 Often the co ntent discussed in a voice sample affects which frequency -equivalents are displayed in the voice print. Sharry observed that when we talk abou t our health, frequency information about vitamins, minerals and nutrients is often present in the voiceprint. If we discuss a skin disorder, information about the skin is usually revealed. If we talk about our love life, the voiceprint often reveals associated feelings, as well as information concerning the health of our heart. Louise Hay109 has written several books on the connections of feelings and physical bodies. She believes the electromagnetic energy of an emotion accumulates on a subtle level in a specific location in the body. For example, emotions regarding people we love collect around our heart s. When we c annot stomach something, these stressed feelings settle around our bellies and influence our digestion and stomach health. When we feel overwhelmed or cannot shoulder our responsibility, these feelings impact our upper back muscles, tissues and backbon e. Research Needed After watching many successes Sharry achieve s breakthrough insights into how our bodies work. Lack of resources has prevented Sharry from scientifically investigating all her discoveries. Many scientific studies could confirm or modify her observations and methods. She has produced consistent results in helping the body to improve issues that the medical field currently offers minimum treatment. Sharry's discoveries may provide solutions to many unsolved riddles of our time. If even hal f her discoveries are validated, this could offer hope to millions. Here are some samples of her fascinating observations: Frequencies from environmental toxins, such as formaldehydes used in building construction, are consistent risers in voiceprints of people struggling with learning disabilities. We should study the relationship between certain building materials and learning disabilities. People with autism have allergies to a chemical found in vaccinations, preventing absorption of necessary vitamins , 109 Books by Louise Hay: You Can Heal Yourself and Heal Your Body A -Z. 94 particularly vitamin A. If we took certain chemicals out of vaccinations could we reduce autism rates? People with multiple sclerosis characteristically lack the musical notes A and D in their voices. Will listening to these sounds improve this insidiou s disorder? Too much high fructose corn syrup (an ingredient found in many popular foods) has been shown to diminish mental clarity. A study could reveal the relationship of fructose corn syrup and mental performance. To raise national educational perform ance, should we improve the school lunch menu? Who would consider the health implications of building materials or chemicals in vaccinations without a reason? Vocal profiling unveils the health impacts of unsuspected substances. If confirmed, this informa tion could enable us to prevent suffering and costly remedies. Sharry showed me a fascinating phenomenon. She took a voice sample using a free software recorder, called Audacity.110 The paid version of this program can slow down a voice recording and revers e it as well. Sharry recorded her voice when discuss ing a picture of a mosque. When Sharry slowed down the recording, a dotted picture emerged, resembling the picture of the mosque. She then described a finding of David Oats, who was a guest on her weekl y radio show. David reversed recorded voice samples. He declared that there were hidden vocal messages when the voice sample was reversed and slowed down about 20 percent. Summary of Voiceprints A voiceprint can: Reveal an accurate picture of physical a nd emotional frequencies in the body. Reflect imbalances before they physically manifest, enabling the prevent ion of disease. Correlate specif ic emotions with physical issues providing a precise mind -body link. 110http://audio.popula rdownloads.com/audacity/index.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium= cpa&utm_campaign=audio -audacity&gclid=CMvQ_InnuKICFRRM5Qod0VVb7Q 95 Provide unsuspected links between our envir onment, nutrition and our health. Further study may enable us to prevent troublesome health issues. Chapter Three Music in the Body Music creates melodies111 and harmonies .112 Rhythms, dynamics113 and tempo114 animate a song's melody. Instrumentation and th e expression o f feelings add depth to music. The following musical elements can be heard within the orchestra of our bodies. The Melody When one frequency after another is recorded on a voiceprint, a melody is created. Sharry uses voiceprints to track biochemical processes in the body that express themselves as frequencies. She learned that body -processes create frequencies with a melody and a rhythm - for example, digestion creates a series of musical frequencies, a song. The French physicist, Joel Ste rnheimer, identified pitches of amino acids in plants. Amino acids align in a certain order to create a protein. He organized the notes of each amino acid in the same order that they formed a protein . This produced recognizable melodies such as O Sole Mio and Blue Danube . When he played the protein's melody back to the plant, its growth doubled and improved its resistance to drought and disease.115 The plant thrived when it heard its own song! 111 a series of notes that creates a recognizable musical phrase 112 consonant sounding intervals of notes 113 various volumes of sou nd 114 variations of the speed of a rhythm 115 Maman, Fabien. The Role of Music in the Twenty -First Century , Tamado Pre ss: Boulder Co.,1997 , pg. 15. 96 Dynamics The time -doma in voiceprint counts the number of tim es a frequency occurs , documenting the distribution (volume or loudness) of each note. Our body is full of notes, each with a different volume . This parallels dynamics that are essential to good music. The dynamics of healthy pitches in our bodies fall in a specific range. When a frequency is too loud or too soft, health issues can result. Glissando In music, a glissando is a rapid slide of ascending or descending consecutive tones. Fire sirens often raise and lower in pitch in a smooth transition, which represents a glissando. Many ancient sound healing practices, such as toning, involve people singing and listening to glissandos. A health frequency -domain voiceprint displays a wave -like pattern comprised o f individual tones. A healthy person 's voice print creates patterns that represent a glissando. Tempo and Rhythm The frequency -domain voiceprint can show patterns or pulses in our voice's architecture, reflecting rhythmic patterns. Our heartbeat and breath establish tempos and rhythms in our bodi es. Sharry tells us that internal pitches need to be in the proper rhythm for our bodies to heal itself. Our pace and musical tempos change as we vary our physical, mental and emotional activities. For example, our tempo speeds up when we exercise and r elaxes during meditation. Instrumentation Organs and body system s create sounds that resemble instrument group s. The lungs represent the wind section of an orchestra, our heart s mimic a drummer . Each organ is like an instrument playing in our internal s ymphony. 97 Different instruments each have their own timbre or quality of sound. Sounds from different organs and body processes also have variations in timbre. Differences in timbre are produced from varying volumes of harmonics. Most people do not noti ce harmonics unless they are in a cathedral or a building with excellent acoustics. They perceive an echo after each sound, which includes harmonics. People clearly hear harmonics when they listen to different instruments. When a violin plays a C and a tru mpet plays the same note, people can tell the difference. Varying volumes of harmonics create the difference. The harmonics created by the violin (a wood instrument) compared with harmonics created by the trumpet (which is made of metal) are the same pitch , but the volume of the harmonic s varies. The material that the instrument is made out of creates resonance ranges in which certain harmonics are emphasized. Higher harmonics are emphasized in the violin's music, while lower harmonics are louder in the trumpet. The difference in sound quality is called timbre. The untrained human ear typically does not perceive harmonics as separate notes. Instead, harmonics are perceived as the timbre of the tone. Intervals Two or more frequencies expressed at the same time or sequentially create intervals. An abundance of t ones in our bodies creat es a steady stream of changing intervals. Sharry discovered the effects of each musical interval in the body , but s he retains these details as proprietary information . Just as a car with a stereo system blasting deep bass tones that rattle our bo nes, high notes t ickle our skin. Different intervals have a stronger impact on various levels of our bodies. Chords Three or more different notes that sound simultaneously create chords . Chords are the underlying patterns of notes that accompany musical melodies. Many freque ncies in the body mirror chords without people realizing that chords sound inside their bodies. Major chords produce a happy feeli ng. Minor chords result in a sadder feeling, almost as if one is withdrawing. Other chords create distinctive feelings reminiscent of the Greek tetra chords; each note pattern emulates a type of personality with distinctive emotional 98 qualities. Tiny freque ncies in our bodies create all of these variations of chords. Expression of Feelings The master musician moves our hea rts as we immerse ourselves in the emotion he creates. Music can make us weep, dance, march or enter a meditative space. The music withi n our body resonates with our feelings. Each pitch created in our physical bodies is an octave of an emotional frequency -equivalent. Emotions are evoked due to resonance with pitches from other body processes. The musician's emotions are subtly interw oven in his musical notes. For example, a barbershop quartet is most harmonious when the musicians are harmonious with each other. The relationships among band members can be subtly felt in the group's music. Most things that we do are imbued with emotion s, although it may be unconscious. Even something as small as clipping our nails may be accompanied with a feeling of caring for ourselves. Emotions create a silent track during many of our daily activities. Music transforms these silent tracks into our he aring range. Musical Phrases Music that lasts, like the classical music of the Renaissance, makes mathematical sense. Classical music employs patterns of similar notes, intervals and rhythms. It is coded with rhythmic and tonal mathematical underpinnin gs. Many classical composer s designed mathematical relationships between notes , creating a musical phrase and then repeating this pattern many times. A musical design is created from repeating patterns of notes. Our bodies like patterns of sound. Hans Jen ny, a Swiss physicist, took videos and photos of sound vibrations impacting sand. The sound caused the sand to vibrate, move and form shapes. Consonant intervals produced pleasing , symmetrical patterns and recognizable shapes in the sound. Harsh and disson ant sounds created lopsided and distorted shapes.116 Hans Jenny 116 From Cymatic videos described in: Mattson, Jill. Ancient Sounds Modern Healing , Wings of Light: Oil City, Pa 16301. pg. 45. 99 showed that certain intervals , especially the frequency -equivalents of intervals create d with whole number ratio , create symmetrical patterns. The timing of notes also involves mathematical structure . For example the timing of m any classical phrases follows the mathematical formula for the golden ratio.117 The golden ratio is a proportional relationship among segments in a line. Musical phrases have been timed to reflect the mathematics of this revered proportion. Many Renaissance artists and architects also proportion their works to approximate the golden rati o, because it is consistently perceived to be beautiful and pleasing. Octaves and Resonance Harmonic and musical theor y incorporate s the intrinsic scientific phenomena of wave interactions of octaves and other resonances. The physical body also utilizes the powers of wave interactions and resonances. Resonance is easily explained with an example: Two violins are tuned exactly the same, as we pluck one string it produces a field of sound energy that triggers the other violin's matching string, the matching string will vibrate and produce th e same sound. Resonance occurs when a system absorbs more energy. In physics , resonance is the tendency of a system to oscillate at maximum amplitude at certain frequencies . At these frequencies, even small periodic driving forces produce large ...vibrations, because the system stores vibrational energy.118 When an object is exposed to a frequency a nd this oscillation matches the system's natural oscillation or frequency, the system increases its energy. Further properties of this process are , Resonant systems can generate vibrations of a 117 In mathematics and the arts, two quantities are in the golden ratio if the ratio between the sum of those quantities and the larger one is the same as the ratio between the larger one and the smaller. The golden ratio is an irrational mathematical constant , approximately 1.6180339887. At least since the Renaissance , many artists and architects have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio - especially in the form of the golden rect angle , in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio - believing this proportion to be aesthetically pleasing. Mathematicians have studied the golden ratio becau se of its unique and interesting properties. 118 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance 100 specific frequency, or pick out specific frequencies from a c omplex vibration containing many frequencies.119 Resonance occurs with all types of vibrations or waves. There are mechanical , acoustic and electromagnetic types of resonance. Let's pretend that each of us is a wineglass and a certain frequency makes us shake, just as sound can make a wineglass shake. This is the fundamental frequency of our body. Related frequencies will also impact us as follows: Sympathetic resonance occur s when our fundamental frequencies vibrate our bodies . Our body naturally matches this frequency . This is the strongest resonant vibration in music and our body. Octave resonance occurs when we hear any oct ave of our fundamental note. Our body naturally matches this frequency. Harmonic resonance occurs when an interval of a third (three notes apart), or a fifth (five notes apart) of our fundamental frequency vibrates our body. Sharry believes there is also a vibratory relationship with the interval of a minor sixth, which directs and influences body maintenance. Harmonic resonances are the weakest of resonance vibrations. No Resonance is a tone that has no relationship with the fundamental frequencies or its harmonics. A tone with no resonance may cause stress. Our body will not noticeably match a frequency of no resonance.120 Sharry observed the sympathetic resonance s that her sound formulas produce within people's bodies. For example, when the note B is soun ded in your body, one of the natural resonances created is F, five notes away. When B, F, and F# sound together, the resulting vibrations nourish the kidneys, help mineral distribution, alleviate high blood pressure and facilitate the system of fluid distr ibution throughout the body. Sharry correlates these notes with emotional energy created by doing too much for others. The person who needs these frequencies learns to set his own boundaries . One with a care - taking nature must take care of oneself. There a re other emotional lessons associated with these frequencies. 119 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance 120 Thompson, Jeffrey, as quoted in Ancient Sounds Modern Healing by Jill Mattson. Wings of Light: Oil City, PA, 2006. pg. 183. 101 Harmonics The scales used in the West approximate the harmonic series although they do not produce these exact frequencies. Given the enormous number (billions) of possible ways to divide octa ves into intervals, why have only a few scales been so strongly favored? A study by Gill and Purves conclude d that civilizations prefer scales similar to the harmonic series.121 Harmonics are softer and difficult to distinguish from the root tone. The pitc h of any root note and its complex array of harmonics are perceive d as only the root note. We do no t hear each harmonic as a separate note, but we sense them as the color of the root note. For example, the C on a violin sounds different than the same C o n a trumpet , reflecting emphasis of different harmonics. When one drops a pebble into a pond, waves ripple around the pebble and move outwards in larger and larger circles. Similarly when we see graphs of sound waves they look like a wavy line . This is a 2-D representation of them. In 3 -D, they resemble a tiny bubble getting progressively larger. As a sound expands, reflected waves interact and create harmonics. Here is another description of how harmonics are created. Harmonics are shorter and faster waves that are reflected between two ends of the string. When a string is struck, the resulting frequencies, whose wavelengths do not divide evenly into the length of the string, get suppressed and the vibrations that persist are called harmonics. The harm onic wavelengths are 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5... of the length of the string. 122 The following illustration is yet another explanation of how one pitch creates harmonic tones. A string vibrates along its entire length and produces a fundamental note. At the sa me time softer vibrations are created from segments of the string, from a half, a third, fourth, and fifth of the string.... These segments form a harmonic series of vibrations.123 121 Gill, Kamraan, Purves, Dale. A Biological Rationale for Musical Scales, Center for Cognitive Neurobiology: Duke University, N.C., 2009. 122 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic 123 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic 102 The vibration rate of each segment is a multiple of the frequency of the whol e string. Each segment vibrates respectively twice, three times, four times, etc., as fast as the whole string. For example, if the fundamental frequency of the entire string (the root note) is f, the harmonics have frequencies f, 2f, 3f, 4f, etc. The vibr ation of the whole string produces the fundamental tone, and the segments produce weaker subsidiary tones.124 Harmonic frequencies follow this mathematical formula and continue onward and upward - potentially to infinity. Harmonics are frequency components of everything. Jonathan Goldman summarizes, Since anything that vibrates creates harmonics, and the universe is composed of nothing but vibrations, everything creates fundamental tones and harmonics, ranging from electrons orbiting around atoms to the p lanets orbiting around the sun.125 Many universal principles of botany, chemistry and other sciences follow principles of the harmonics series. In many esoteric schools of thought the study of musical harm ony was the study of everything because we are har d wired to recognize harmonics and other sounds representing special geometric shapes. To illustrate this point, consider that when a building or a person is considered beautiful, their prop ortions follow certain geometry , suggesting that we are ha rdwire d to enjoy this geometry . German physicist Ernst Chladni published a book in 1787126 describing his experiments with visualizing mus ical tones as auditory geometric s. He sprinkled sand on round and square metal objects, and then vibrated the edge with a vi olin bow and elaborate shapes formed in the sand. Patterns formed whenever harmonic frequencies were applied to the flat surfaces. Once again, this suggests that there is something special about these harmonic intervals. (See Appendix B for information abo ut the suppression of harmonics in history.) Vibrations in our bodies create pitches, triggering harmonic notes. Inaudible subtle sounds interact with our subtle energy and create harmonics. Harmonics intermingle wit h the web of sound that 124 Columbia Encyclopedia : Harmonics 125 Goldman, Jonathan. Healing Sounds: The Power of Harmonics , Inner Traditions: Vermont, 2002. pg. 31. 126 Chaldni, Ernst. Entdeckungen uber die Theorie des Klanges. 103 envelopes us. We do not hear all of these tiny sounds, but they affect our mind, body and emotions. Also, the voiceprint captures the frequencies of these harmonics. Harmonics and pitches are both frequencies. Both the originating frequency and the resulting harmonic f requencies impact the body. Harmonics have lower volumes, but low level energy (low frequencies on the electromagnetic scale) can be extremely important in our body, according to Dr. Becker in his book Cross Currents , Perils of Electopollution, Promise of Electro Medicine .127 Low levels of energy, such as energy from harmonics, radiate from our bodies in analog format. As we described earlier, analog systems use a seamless range of values to represent information , producing continuous tones. Analog sounds are a precise representation of the original sound. Digital and analog sounds create different patterns of harmonics. Therefore, even though the root pitch may be the same, the harmonics are different in digital and analog sounds. When drawn, analog ha rmonics look like a concentric circle around the root frequency. If the first ring (first harmonic) represents 10 hertz, then the second ring (second harmonic) represents 20 hertz, and the third ring correlates to 30 hertz and so on . Analog sound produces simple predictable waves. Digital sounds produce what Sharry calls untrue harmonics. The digital tone is composed of averaged pitches within a range of sounds. Each averaged pitch produces a harmonic series. The resulting pattern of harmonic series varies according to the distance between each averaged sample of sound. When recorded digital harmonic frequencies are drawn, they look like a set of steps. Each step represents a bit of sound information. Each step then produces another harmonic series. A tremendous number of harmonic waves interact, forming a complicated wave. Sharry has 127 Becker, Robert, Dr. Cross Currents, The Perils of Electropollution, The Promise of Elect romedicine , Penguin Group: New York, 1990. pg. 71. 104 found that digital sounds are effective in shattering toxins and pathogens and allowing the body to excrete the pieces.128 Another reason that Sharry uses analog sounds in her tone boxes is because of the exacting harmonics created by analog frequencies. The brain readily recognizes harmonics and these frequencies balance and tune multiple systems in our body. The p itches in a harmonic series affect various body parts and pr ocesses . Harmonics create a 16 note \"chord\" that often mirror recognizable, biological processes.129 Sharry reports that some analog harmonics follow bio -chemical processes in the body - such as the Kreb's cycle (a series of steps in the oxidation of carbo hydrates). Listening to the harmonics of the Kreb's cycle has produced remission in some types of cancer.130 Harmonic series play a crucial role in the healing of the body. When different harmonic series interact, a sound matrix is created within the body. Sharry compares the interrelat ing harmonic groups to Rubik 's Cubes. Sharry's advanced software analyz es the interaction of different harmonic patterns and how one detuned harmonic affects the entire series. Music within the Body In a broad perspective, from melodies to rhythms to emotional expression, our bodies sing our unique songs, participating in the choir of the uni -verse (meaning one song) . An old Chinese saying echoes this theme , There will be a time when man will not be known by his name, but b y his personal melody.131 Unlike a musical composition, our bodies have consciousness. Our brain is the orchestra conductor that creates an innate musical system to restor e our harmonic imbalances. We consciously choose music to help us express an emotion, but the attraction goes deeper. We are attracted to frequencies that our body needs to maintain its health on 128 Kirilean photography produced by Fabien Maman at www.Tamo -do.com shows that certain pitches are capable of breaking up helia cancer cells. Typically, toxic and patho gen cells are not as pliable and flexible as other cells. 129 http://www.lifespirit.org/SHRI -string -theory.htm#String%20Theory 130 Davis, Dorinne. Sound Bodies through Sound Therapy, Kalco Publishing: Landing, New Jersey, 2004. pg. 246. 131 Edwards, Sharry. BioAcoustic Biology , Sound Health: Albany. pg. 1 -21. 105 many levels . If we need the sound of a D to alleviate a stressed frequency in our body, subconsciously we find ourselves attracted to songs that are in the key of D . Perhaps we will be drawn to a person who emulates this D frequency as his fundamental frequency . Our body subconsciously recruits the singers (be they people, places, sounds, things, or nutrients) that emulate the frequencies that our bodies crave to complete internal harmonic balance. Ancient modal systems of music recognized thes e marvelous links between music and our well -being. Musical Fe ng shui (music to harmonize and balance our unique energy) and healing mantras have been lon g practiced by many ancient civilizations. Chapter Four Processing Frequencies Sharry experienced a breakthrough discovery when she associated pitches with colors. Raising pitches many octaves higher to correspond to the frequencies of light illustr ated a fascinating link between colors and frequencies. Sharry simplified sound healing by using this process to correlate colors with musical notes. This correlation produces an extremely useful application of sound healing. Sharry learned to silence th e noise of a refrigerator by identifying the frequency of the refrigerator's hum and sounding the inverse proportion (the reciprocal) of it. (F times 1/F equals one ). It was illuminating to discover that sounds have counter -frequenc ies that cancel each o ther out. This understanding led to the incredible discovery of how to cancel out the frequency -equivalents of toxins, pathogens and other undesirable frequency -equivalents ! Sharry refers to these c ounter frequencies as antidotes. Calculating a frequenc y- equivalent to cancel a pathogen, toxin or a stressed frequency is a foundational core of BioAcoustics. 106 Thousands of times , Sharry calculated and used antidote frequencies and then tested the effects . Sharry simultaneously used her special hearing and voice capabilities to identify antidote frequencies that worked time after time. She used the underlying relationship between the frequency and the counter frequency. The counter frequency (the reciprocal) of a note was usually six notes away, creating an interval of a musical minor sixth. When Sharry superimposed the frequencies and counter frequencies onto a color wheel, the two notes that were a musical minor sixth apart were complementary colors! This led her to believe that complementary colors are rec iprocals, or inverse proportions of each other. Said another way, a pitch that is an interval of a minor sixth away (or an octave of a complementary color) can balance many problematic stringers and risers in our voiceprint. Sharry made the process of ca lculat ing counter frequencies easier by thinking of the body's frequencies in terms of colors. T he sounds associated with complementary colors are six musical notes apart on the musical scale. Frequencies associated with complementary colors can cancel eac h other out. In addition to being an elemental building block in BioAcoustics, this application has other ramifications. Scientists have been absorbed with measuring brain waves in a linear fashion. Beta, alpha, delta and theta brain waves are organized in a linear progression. If scientists superimpose brain waves on a color wheel, they might gain more insight of the math of the brain and body. Emotions and Pitches Each frequency has an octave that is in the broad band of emotions. We can temper our emot ions by tuning to reciprocal tones of the emotional frequency . Some of the emotional challenges associated with each note are: C - Difficulty self -directing and self -empowerment issues C# - Secretly hard on self, hard on others as a cover, and can be defensively sarcastic D - Lack of self -approval, complains and likes to fix people/things/issues D# - Difficulty sharing emotions E - Self sabotages and needs to be needed F - Procra stinates or is a workaholic, an inability to integrate perception and action 107 F# - Works on unimportant things, avoid s important tasks and, at worst, just ignores everything G - Have problems prioritizing physical issues and tends to get depressed G# - Spreads self too thin, lack of confidence, and sways from egotistical to lack of self -esteem A - Has problems prioritizing non -physical issues and tend s to rely on what they think you mean A# - Others ar e more important , give a great deal ph ysically and emotionally and are hurt easily B - Martyrs, think they deserve things but do not know how to get them without appearing selfish 108 This chart 132 describes positive associations between pitches and emotions. 132 All copyrighted charts have been printed with permission from Sharry Edwards. 109 Brain Dominance Sharry found a fascinating phenomen on regarding how each brain hemisphere processes frequencies and this aff ected her frequency remedies. The left and right hemispheres of our brains work differently. The following table illustrates the specialties of left -brain and right -brain thinking:133 Left-Brain Functions Right -Brain Functions Logical Random Sequentia l Intuitive Rational Holistic Analytical Synthesizing Objective Subjective Looks at parts Looks at whole Detail oriented Uses feelings Facts rule Imagination rules Reality based Fantasy based Forms strategies Presents possibilities Practical Impet uous Likes math/science Likes philosophy/ religion Uses words and language Uses symbols and images Likes order/pattern perception Likes spatial perception Most people predominately utilize one brain hemisphere or the other. There are gifted people who use both halves of the brain equally. As we have said, each brain hemisphere has separate functions and methods of processing information. Many functions of one hemisphere cannot be done in the opposi te hemisphere. For example, the right ear (and the l eft-brain) is involved in coordination of phonation, the all -musical facilities and the left ear cannot replace these functions.134 133 http://www.funderstanding.com/content/right -brain -vs-left-brain 134 Dr. Tomatis. The Ear and the Voice, The Scarecrow Press : Maryland, Toronto, Oxford, 1987. Translated into English in 2005. pg. 25. 110 Dr. Tomatis links the right -brain with the left ear, and the left -brain with the right ear. He further describes the pathway of sound from each ear to its associated brain hemisphere. He details, Stimulus in the left ear has to cross the corpus collosum in the brain and will lose time in conduction of impulses.135 People habitually process most frequencies with either their rig ht or left ear. We have right or left ear dominance, just as we are right or left handed. Dr. Tomatis reports that those with left -ear-dominance may experience learning disabilities, because the sound information has further to travel, lengthening the time it takes to be processed.136 The following experiment will demonstrate right or left ear dominance. If one is right -ear-dominant and he blocks his right ear with his hand, sound is forced to use the longer route of the left ear. Sounds lose some high pitc hes along the way and it seems lower in pitch.137 When someone blocks the right ear and if sound appears to drop, then he is right -ear-dominant. If blocking the right ear does not produce a lowering of a pitch, then the person is left -ear-dominant. When on e is left -ear dominant the blocking of the right ear makes no difference, because the sound is primarily processed through the left ear. If one is left ear dominant the blocking of the right ear does not change anything. Another method of determining bra in dominance is to note preferences for doing things with the right or left side of the body. People who habitually use the right side of their body predominantly use their left -brain hemisphere. People, who favor the left side of their body, prefer right -brain usage . Some people are equal in their brain usage. While working on a project with researchers at an air force base, Sharry found clues that led to her discovery of brain dominance and frequency processing. In this project , Sharry was to select a so und and a flashing colored light to help pilots avoid stress while flying. A 135 Dr. Tomatis. The Ear and the Voice, The Scarecrow Press: Maryland, Toronto, Oxford, 1987. Translated into English in 2005. pg. 26. 136 Dr. Tomatis details how to change ear dom inance by short bursts of intense sounds for short periods of time. He calls this auditory saturation and likens it to the same process that happens when your eyes are subjected to a bright flash of light. Dr. Tomatis. The Ear and the Voice, The Scarecrow Press: Maryland, Toronto, Oxford, 1987. Translated into English in 2005. pg. 22. 137 Dr. Tomatis. The Ear and the Voice, The Scarecrow Press: Maryland, Toronto, Oxford, 1987. Translated into English in 2005. pg. 22. 111 sound of eight cycles per second was effective in some cases. Sharry observed that this frequency worked on 40 percent of the pilots when a green light flashed. If the pilots saw a flashing red light, a different 40 percent remained alert. Since Sharry's education included learning modalities and brain dominance, she noted similarities in percentages of effectiveness of the flashin g colored lights, their rhythms and the percentage of brain dominance among people. Statistically, 40 percent of the pilots would be right -brained, 40 percent would be left - brained and the remaining 20 percent would use their whole brain. Sharry concluded that brain dominance altered the impact in the bod y of color and frequency. In order for the frequency to be effective, those using their right -brain hemisphere needed one color and rhythm combination, and those using their left -brain needed the complementary color. This insight proved to be a keystone breakthrough in her fascinating string of discoveries. Each brain hemisphere processes information differently (including pitches and color) and not surprisingly , calculates frequencies and colors differently. It seems that they process FEs in an opposite manner. Brain dominance determines whether we need to listen to one pitch or another that is a musical minor sixth away in order to balance a problematic stringer in our voice print. Each brain hemisphere we use to process a color that we see or a pitch th at we hear, creates a different or opposite effect. Not considering brain dominance is a mistake often made by color therapists. For example, if you give a lef t-brained color and a left -brained sound to a left brained person, the color and sound cancel eac h other out. Sharry came up with formulas on how to select antidote frequencies taking brain dominance into account: Left-brained people process sounds that correspond to opposite (complementary) colors . To balance a problematic frequency for a left brai ned person, give him the weak or missing pitch. Right -brained people process sounds that correspond to the same color. To balance a problematic note, the likely solution is listening to more of the problematic frequency. When the same frequency is sounded the body produces the antidote. 112 Whole -brained people use their right and left brain hemispheres for approximately equal amounts of time. The method of processing colors and sounds with these people varies, depending on which brain hemisphere they are usi ng. Here i s an example illustrating how each brain hemisphere processes colors differently. A right -brained person, who is clairvoyant see s Sharry's aura as violet , but a left -brained person sees the same aura as gold, the complementary color of vio let. A whole -brained person sees the color white, the combination of the two. In all cases, Sharry's aura remains the same. My son and I experienced issues with dyslexia. Initially my son copied letters that he saw upside down and backwards. With training and several years of school , he altered his perception. Now, h e copies the letters he sees correctly as he has been taught. His brain correct ed his interpretation of his vision to conform to what people told him the letters looked like . I doubt that his bra in was rewired, but his brain translated the frequencies to satisfy his teachers . I wonder if right and left brained people actually see colors differently, but our society teaches us to translate the frequency so that we all identify the FE in the same w ay. In the example of Sharry's aura perhaps we see different colors in the aura because we have not been trained to see the aura as this color or that. Similarly, the frequency for a red pigment color remains the same, but maybe some initially saw it as re d and others as green depending on which brain hemisphere they were using. Both have learned to identify the frequency of red with the color of red, regardless of their initial intake of frequency data. Perhaps some see the color green and in a split secon d subconsciously shift the perception of this frequency to red, the complementary color. If this hypothesis is correct, then it would be difficult to recognize the different ways the brain hemispheres process frequencies. The process explained below will clarify how to lower and raise problematic frequencies depending on which brain hemisphere a person is using. The voiceprint's graph reflects the pitch of A#, above the range of the voice's healthy architecture. Our goal is to lower the A# frequency. 113 To lower the A# frequency, do we need to listen to A# or listen to more of its reciprocal, E? Logically it should not make a difference, but it does! If we a re right -brained we should listen to A# . If we are right -brained, listening to E will not balance the overabundant A# . In contrast, if we are left -brained we should listen to E to lower and harmonize the problematic frequency. If we are left -brained, we process together colors and sounds that are opposites. Therefore, we need the opposite colo r, yellow to balance violet, or E to balance the A#. The differences in approaches to correct a frequency imbalance stem from the opposing methods that each brain hemisphere uses to calculate frequencies and colors. Each brain hemisphere responds diffe rently to various modalities of medicine for the sam e reason, because each processes frequencies differently. An analogy occurs with a llopathic medicine that refers to the broad category of medical practice, known as Western m edicine. The term allopathic, when used by homeopaths, refers to the use of substances that produce different symptoms than a disease. For example, if one had poison ivy an allopathic doctor would give him anti -poison ivy . An allopathic treatment for fever may use a drug, such as an antibiotic , to attack the cause of the fever - such as a bacterial infectio n. A homeopathic r emedy can be a tincture of poison ivy which your body builds resistance to and fight s it off naturally. A homeopathic treatment for fever is one that can use a diluted dosage of a substance to induce a fever so the body can overcome it and then dissipate an even greater fever. The FEs of allopathic medicine are more effective with predominately left-brained people who process FEs as opposites. FEs of Background Information A# is equivalent to the color violet an d E correlates to the color yellow. Violet and yellow are complementary colors. 114 homeopathic medicine are more effective with those who are predominately right -brained, who process FEs as similar energy. Ancient civilizations recognized this phenomenon and altered the type of medicine practiced among people depending on their brain dominance and how they used their senses.138 The methodology of medicine varied according to different brai n dominance.139 Perhaps they used allopathic medicine for left -brained people and homeopathic medicine for right -brained people. Modern knowledge must progress along a similar path to understand the significance of some ancient practices. People can shift brain dominance throughout the day. The brain hemisphere best suited to a task takes over. An artistic project may trigger the predominant use the right brain hemisphere, while adding a series of numbers may create a shift to left -brain hemisphere dominan ce. It would seem that the frequency that a body needs can change throughout the day. Sharry was working with a child with seizure disorders. One frequency helped him when he used one brain hemisphere and hurt him when he switched to the other. While Sharr y was considering how to stabilize the child's brain usage, his brother recalled being taught during yoga to breathe out of the right nostril by closing his left nostril with his finger. He suggested that Sharry stuff a crayon up his brother's nose so he w ould use only one nostril while listen ing to the healing frequencies h ence, stabilizing his brain usage. What an idea! Sharry put cotton in one nostril, which caused his baby brother to use the opposite brain hemisphere consistently, so he could benefit co nsistently from a tonal pattern. Color Healing If the issue of brain dominance is not complicated enough, a third factor affects the selection of a counter frequency formulation. An examination of colored lights, used for healing purposes, make s it easie r to explain this phenomenon . Many believe that the sole purpose of the eyes is to see and that the main usage of color is to satisfy our personal taste s. In contrast, 138 Gerber, Richard, MD. The Number On e Handbook of Subtle -Energy Therapies, third edition. Bear and Co.: Vermont. 2001. pg. 330. 139 Gerber, Richard, MD. Vibrational Medicine, The Number One Handbook of Subtle -Energy Therapies, third edition. Bear and Co.: Vermont, 2001. pg. 330. 115 people who utilize lights for healing believe that colors have a far deeper impact on the health and psyche of a human being. In antiquity healers used materials to filter sunlight to create the effect of colored lights , which they used to treat people. Ancient writings describe people using colored lights for healing purposes in Heliopolo s, Egypt, as well as in early Greece, China and India.140 Today, there are still healing modalities using colored lights. Two modern pioneers were Edwin Babbitt and Dinshah Ghadiale. The Dinshah Health Society141 offers a color -spectrum -based health system. Th is system has been in us e since 1920 and was used in a major medical center in Philadelphia for many years. This system utilizes simple, low -powered lamps and color filters to counter particular physical problems. Many people have difficulty imagining th at a colored light causes a physiologic effect inside the human body. Traditional medical research has observed effects of light within the body. Blue -light therapy is used for some types of neonatal jaundice. Blue light is applied to the skin to cause a c hemical reaction in the blood circulating under the surface of the skin, effectively lessening bilirubin levels.142 In another case, an ultraviolet light generates the production of vitamin D. The human body produces vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. Addit ionally , full spectrum light exposure helps those with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a condition believed to be caused by insufficient light exposure throug h the eyes to the hypothalamus and to the pituitary gland, which controls the endocrine system.143 Color healing assumes that chemical elements radia te FEs that have octaves resonating within the color spectrum. For example, the prevailing corresponding color wave of hydrogen is red and that of oxygen is blue.144 Each organ also has sympathetic resonan ce with a color wavelength. The liver is believed to radiate ene rgy that is an 140 Gerber, R ichard, MD. Vibrational Medicine, The Number One Handbook of Subtle -Energy Therapies, third edition. Bear and Co.: Vermont. 2001. pg. 275. 141 http://www.dinshahhealth.org 142 Bilirubin is the yellow breakdown product of normal heme catabolism . Heme is found in hemoglobin , a principal component of red blood cells . Bilirubin is excreted in bile and urine , and el evated levels may indicate certain diseases. It is responsible for the yellow color of bruises , urine, and the yellow discoloration in jaundice . 143 magenta and the lymphatic system , yellow. When a particular organ or body system is undera ctive, its energy has decreased. A n energizing color is projected on the skin near the organ , sometimes the entire body . If a system is overactive (due to a fever) , the remedy is the opposite . A depressing color is used. Everything on the red side of the sp ectrum is more or less stimulating while the blue portion is sedating. People who use color and sound in combination need to consider the interaction of these energies. It is as if lights and tones speak the same language, but one has a higher pitched voi ce. A red light and a sound frequency that correlates with red can create an increased amount of red energy, depending on one's brain dominance ; the combination of the same color and sound can also cancel each other out. We can apply Sharry's rule of t humb when we combine sounds and colors. As we noted earlier, left -brained people perceive color and sound differently. For these people, the tone and its complementary color cancel each other out. Right -brained people perce ive color and sound as the same and more of the problematic frequency has a canceling effect . Whole -brained people adjust the method of processing colors and sounds, depending on which brain hemisph ere they are using at the time . In summary, first we learned that a frequency that is an octave of a complementary color can balance a stressed frequency. In this way complementary colors are opposites. Second, we discovered that each brain hemisphere processes frequenc ies and colors in opposite ways so the above formula varies once again bas ed on brain dominance. Third, we learned that colored lights and frequencies affect one another. They interact, even though they are in different octaves. They can complement each other , but brain dominance can reverse the impact . There is another tier o f complexity regarding the selection of antidote frequencies. Sharry watched some FEs succes sfully cancel problematic sounds and then she superimposed them on a color wheel. She observed that s ometime s the antidote frequency followed scientific rules for m ixing colored pigments. Other times it followed the rules for mixing colored lights. Some people process fre quencies 117 as if they were lights and others combine frequencies using the rules of mixing colored pigments. The reason this happens is unclear and Sharry does not offer an explanation. In a philosophical attempt to grasp why this happens, Sharry divides people into earth and light categories.145 Earth people are attracted to nature and have a natural instinct with herbs. Perhaps t hese people predomi nately process colors as pigments. Others are abstract thinkers and spiritually interested in the light. Their bodies may prefer to process colors as lights. These innate tendencies may affect the body's color processing preferences. Sharry developed a p rimitive way to discern if a person primarily processes colors as lights or pigments. On the Color , Tones and Signs chart on page 189 locate your astrological sign. Your fundamental frequency and color are listed next to your astrological sign. If your f avorite color is the same as your astrological sign, then you are likely left brained. If your favorite color is 180 degrees across the color wheel (if your favorite color is the complementary color of your astrological sign ), then you are most likely righ t brained and are showing a pigment response to color. If your favorite color is across the color wheel and adjacent one shade, then your body process es your favorite color as lights combine, not pigments. Your favorite color is statistically linked to your astrological sign and your body's preferred method of mixing colors as if there were lights or pigments. I am a Capricorn which corresponds to the color of blue violet and the complementary color of yellow orange. If I processed colors as pigments t hen my favorite colors would be blue violet and yellow orange. My favorite colors are blue and yellow. Yellow is an adjacent color on the right of yellow orange on a color wheel. Blue is the color adjacent to blue violet on a color wheel. My favorite color s are across the color wheel and adjacent one shade. I process colors as if they are lights. 145 Sharry got this idea from Auel, Jean. The Clan of the Cave Bear , Random House; 2002. 118 Colored paints and colored lights combine differently, yielding different hues. When we combine all pigments together (the colors of the rainbow), the color blac k is created. In direct contrast, the presence of all the same frequencies of visible light creates white light. The light and pigment processes are inversely related; in one case, the colors combine to form the color black and in the other, they mix to fo rm white light. Objects absorb some wavelengths of the rainbow colors and reflect others. The unabsorbed colors are seen by the eye. A red object does not absorb red wave lengths. The pigment -opposite of red is green and all of the green waves are absorb ed. Pigment colors are solid. Light bounces off of them or is absorbed . This information is translated by your eyes and brain. In subtractive mixing of color , pigment absorbs certain wavelengths and they are subtracted from what you see. The subtractive color model starts with white and different pigments subtract (or absorb) colors from the reflected light creating its color. Light colors are in the air, space or gas. When colors combine their frequencies are added.146 This color system starts without li ght, the color black. Light is added from a light source. Light wavelengths combine and create color. For example, red and green combine resulting in yellow. Red and blue produce magenta. All additive colors combine to form white.147 The selection of a co mplementary color to low er an abundant frequency varies depending on whether or not the body processes the frequency body as light or pigment. The body may use the pigment process at times and the light process at others. When mixing colored lights, prim ary color sets are any three colors of the correct intensity that combine to produce white light. Ther e are a number of primary color sets. The most common ly used is red, green and blue. One colored light can be composed of two primary colors of light and combine with the third color needed to form white light. Mixing the proper intensity of the right two colors creates white light. For example, the complementary color of red light is cyan light, which is the combination of blue and green light . When cyan l ight is 146 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color. 147 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pri mary_color. 119 added to red light, white light is produced. Although it appears that we added two colors to create white light, we actually added three. Only two complementary pigment colors are required to BioAcoustically cancel each other out, but to create t his same effect with light, three colors are needed. When transposing the complementary light -color on a color pigment wheel, the complementary light -color is across the color wheel and adjacent one shade. When Sharry and I were discussing complexities of how our bodies calculate frequencies, she laughed and told me that science depicts red pigment as the note of C. The Rosicrucians148 (a mystic school) depict red as F#. Dinshah149 practitioners who use colored lights for healing depict red as the note of G. This appears to be a contradiction, but in a way they are all correct. For the left -brain, physically oriented person, red is processed at the frequency of C; for the right -brained, emotionally oriented person, red is perceived as F#; and for the light oriented person, red may be perceived as a G. People perceive notes and colors differently, depending on how their body calculates frequencies. Each musical note can impact people differently. Sharry pointed out that she hears a sound coming from the earth . If everyone could hear what she does, people would hear different notes coming from the earth. Those with left -brain dominance would hear an F, and those with right -brain dominance would hear B . The notes B and F correspond to complementary colors. The e arth frequency could also be heard as F #, its light -reciproca l. Other Factors affecting Antidotes The way our bodies process frequencies is intricate: we are a complex of frequencies that interact not only internally, but also with environmental soun ds. There are additional variances that affect how we process lights, colors and frequencies. 148 The Rosicrucian system of study provides a foundation that ties together different aspects of metaphysical study and demonstrates their interconnectedness to natural laws that govern all realms. Many Rosicrucian teachings go back to the myste ry schools of ancient Egypt and Europe. www.Rosicrucian.org 149 Dinshah Health Society utilizes safe, specific colored light for particular problems with a simple, low -powered lamp and color filters. 120 People process color differently depending on eye color, geographic location, atmospheric conditions, time of day and altitude. 150 The human eye's ability to perceive color according to the amount of light that hits it is called the Purkinje Shift .151 Dimmer light triggers more of the eye's blue wave length, making blues more vivid . More intense light fire s the red wavelengths, making red appear more vivid. This causes mountains in the distance to appear blueish and red flowers more vivid when we are close to them. Atmospheric condition s also affect coloration . Hot, high, dry and sunny locations such as J aipur, India show intense coloration. Low, humid and cloudy locations , such as the coast of Thailand , show a darker and drabber coloration. 152 Color is in the eye of the beholder. Another factor that affects how we see color is our eye coloration (blue, br own, or hazel). Think of the color of our eyes as colored sunglasses. Blue eyes can differentiate up to 30% more color shades than dark colored eyes, because they are a lighter color.153 Colors and sound can impact us in many ways and on numerous levels. I magine a huge pool into which someone drops a dozen pebbles. Each pebble creates rings of waves, which interact with other waves. Waves bounce off the sides of the p ool. Reflected waves angle back further changing each other. The science of these intricate interactions is complex. Numerous people say that there is yet another level to creating a healing antidote and have suggested that one's intent and attitude affect healing. Jonathan Goldman underscores this with his formula: frequency plus intent equa ls healing.154 Many studies on the placebo effect demonstrate that an ill person's belief of recovery impacts their healing. Clearly , attitude and positive intent play a role in affecting healing formulas. In this complex analysis of discovering what frequ encies or colors are needed to harmonize stressed frequencies in our voice, a 150 http://www.khazargems.com/color_and_gemstones.asp 151 http://www.khazargems.com/color_and_gemstones.asp 152 http://www.khazargems.com/color_and_gemstones.asp 153 http://www.khazargems.com/color_and_gemstones.asp 154 Goldman, Jonathan. Shifting Frequencies , Light Technologies Publishing: Az., 1998. pg. 5. 121 simplification is welcomed. We are attracted to the frequencies that harmonize us whether it is a balancing frequency, a favorite color, a song we love, a pleasing fragrance, a f ood we find delicious, or a person, place or thing. We are subconsciously drawn to the pitches, colors and FEs of things that are uniquely healing. What we enjoy heals us! Due to the maze of complexities involved in deciphering a sonic formula for antidot es, visit a trained Sound Health practitioner to get your healing frequencies.155 If you see a practitioner trained by Sharry you will be required to test your frequencies in person . Due to all of these complexities testing insures that your final frequencie s will accomplish your goals. Alternatively, if you take Sharry's course, you receive software and procedures to navigate through these complexities of sound healing. Chapter Five More Body Math There are additional considerations in the selection of optimal sound formulas. We will discuss an overview of these concepts; Sharry retains proprietary details regarding the understanding and implementation of advanced sound applications. If you are interested in further education on these topics, she teac hes a weeklong course that provides additional information. In 1623, Galileo Galilei is credited with saying , The great book of nature can be read only by those who know the language in which it was written. And this language is mathematics.156 The Germa n philosopher, scientist and mathematician, Leibniz (1646 -1716) 155 At www.nutrasounds.com there are sections on Becoming a Client and Finding a Practitioner for anyone interested in getting a BioAcoustic reading. One can schedule a session from Sharry, but be prepared for a waiting pe riod. To accommodate more people, Sharry trained thousands of practitioners, who use her software, her databases and techniques. These people are located across the United States and also in other countries. Their contact information is listed on the websi te. 156 Edwards, Sharry. Vocal Profiling for the Professional . Sound Health: Athens, Ohio, 2002. Module 1. 122 reflects on musical frequency patterns , When engaging in music, the mind is engaging in an unconscious exercise in math.157 Present day author and mathematician, Brian Butterworth, postulates that math is the language of the brain. There are no language barriers in math. A mathematical equation such as 1 + 1 = 2 is the same for every culture. Further, our brain and biology are hardwired to respond to the basic principles of math.158 Sharry bel ieves that the numbers associated with the pitches that comprise our voices represent the language of our body. Sharry uses the language of the brain, which is mathematics (expresse d as frequencies or brainwaves) , to talk to a body. Decodi ng the math of the body is not simple. Body -math is complicated , but once mastered it is predictable. The sonic world within our bodies has mind -boggling interactions and musical complexities; mathematical relationships underline everything. According to Butterworth, w ithout frequency expressed as electromagnetic energy, our bodies could not be animated.159 Sharry has unraveled many mathematical formulations. Each nutrient, biochemical, organ and emotion has predictable, mathematic al relationships. Th ey communicate throu gh the neurological , nervous, circulatory and other systems. Since the language of the body is math, numbers correspond to sound frequencies like the letters of our alphabet. The number of the cycles per second (hertz) is used as the numbers in this mathe matical system. The cycles per second can be used in the same manner as the numbers that we manipulate in math class. There are many ways that a mathematical equation can yield the same answer. Remember that waves interact, combining and subtracting - depending on how they overlap. There are many combinations of wave interactions that yield the same answer. For example, someone needs a six -cycle frequency to balance a pitch in his voice. He could 157 Thaut, Michael. Rhythm, Music and the Brain: Scientific Foundations and Clinical Applications , Routledge: NY, 2005. pg. 30. 158 Butterworth, Brian. What Counts, How Every Brain is Hardwired for Math. Free Press: N.Y., 1999. 159 Butterworth, Brian. What Counts, How Every Brain is Hardwired for Math. Free Press: N.Y., 1999. 123 listen to a frequency of six cycles per second, or two frequ encies at the same time: one wave of five cycles and another of one cycle per second. Different sound waves, when in phase, combine energy. In the example above, the two waves can create a six -cycle frequency, because 5 + 1 = 6. Keep in mind that not all s ix-cycle frequencies have the same effect on the body. One would think that a 1 + 5 frequency is the same as a 2 + 4 frequency, but it is not. The body require s the correct formula for obtaining a certain frequency. A wave of two cycles per second that is in phase with a three cycles per second wave , combines and forms a wave of five cycles per second (2 + 3 = 5). A person can receive the frequency of a five by many means, such as 3 + 2 = 5, or 1 + 4 = 5, or 10 - 5 = 5 , but only the correct formula works a nd influence s the body to correct itself. So, how do we tell which formula is the appropriate pattern? Many chemical processes take place within the body. Each chemical process can be expressed with math ; the FEs of nutrients can be inserted into mathema tical, chemical equations. Many equations of body processes are known and can be found online at pub -med for instance. Each element and nutrient in the chemical formula has a corresponding FE. Using the cycles per second as a numbering system, the freque ncy of a nutrient can be used as a mathematical number and inserted into equations of chemicals reacting in the body. When t hese numbers are inserted into the chemical equation the formulas make mathematical sense . The right frequencies in the appropriate mathematical pathway are critical for body processes to function optimally. For instance, the Krebs cycle is a series of biochemical changes that occur during the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and amino acids, which facilitates the storage of energ y. It is named after Hans Krebs (1900 -1981) , the biochemist who identified it. The fundamental process involves oxidizing acetate molecul es to carbon dioxide and water to transfer metabolic energy to \"high energy\" bonds for later use by the body. The Krebs cycle is a specific chemical formula that describes nutrients and how they transform in each stage of the equation. Sharry inserts the FEs of nutrients into the Krebs cycle formula and then creates a series of tones to support the metabolism of nutrients. 124 Calcium and magnesium are used together in the body. When one combines t he FEs of calcium and magnesium the result is the FE of the bone matrix protein , phosphorus . The body's chemical processes can be shown mathematically with FEs. Bio Acoustically spea king, biochemical relationships are also frequency relationships.160 Thousands of mathemati cal associations of frequencies , which follow biochemical processes in the body have been identified. Author , Rita Holl,161 correctly hypothesized that voiceprints of people with osteoporosis would show calcium FEs out of balance. The FE of an element or compound allows the body to detect its presence, but t he body is adept at compensating, substituting and transmuting frequencies. If biochemicals have similar frequen cies, they are nearly interchangeable, performing the same work. Sulfur and palmitic acid have similar FEs. They can substitute for each other in the fight against invading pathogens. If an enzyme is not available to help counter invading pathogens, other biochemicals with similar FEs can compensate . The note of C strengthens the thumb. The FE of the thumb muscle corresponds to the FE of zinc. The body will accept the zinc FE to support the thumb muscle. When a body needs a nutrient, it shows up as lacki ng or surprisingly abundant in the voiceprint. Calcium shows up as overabundant for people who hav e osteoporosis and need calcium but can't assimilate it. This may happen because the nutrient is not in the right form for the body to utilize it or the body needs another nutrient to assimilate the over abundant frequency. We do not need t o apply a complementary color because we do not wa nt to cancel out this frequency. I t is not problematic like a pathogen or toxin. We want the body to utilize the FE of a nut rient. Biochemicals must be in balance for the body to utilize them. Every biochemical has another frequency that activates it. For example, we take magnesium with calcium in order for our body to create phosphorus, which enables the body to absorb both calcium and 160 Sharry Edwards infers a relationship between electrons and frequency: The vala nce electrons govern chemical reactions, and valances' are frequency shells around the nucleus of the atom. 161 Holl, Rita. Alternative Health Practitioner. 1996. 125 magnesium. When the body is unable to use calcium, deposits collect in the joints, creating the condition called arthritis. When one has attention deficit disorder, one's adrenaline FE is too high because the body cannot use it. Sharry's formul as of FEs mirror biochemical equations that allow the body to balance nutrients and vitamins, enabling them to be utilized. If niacin's FE is a B and you listen to it, you activate the niacin. An additional frequency, called an energy -equivalent, combine s with the frequency of niacin to be use d in the body. In the example referring to attention deficit disorder, the sounds of an energy -equivalent pitch can allow the body to absorb and utilize adrenaline, which may help the body to decrease the problematic symptoms of attention deficit disorder. Sharry discovered a three -step process for the body to utilize vitamins and nutrients. She uses this analogy: to get your car moving the ignition must be engaged, the car must be in gear and someone has to step on the gas. Similarly, three steps are necessary to allow the body to efficiently use FEs of nutrients. In this analog y, the FE starts up the car , the energy -equivalent puts the car in gear , and stepping on the gas is similar to e nsuring that frequencies are in the proper rhythm. These steps are required to package a nutrient's FE in order for the body to use it. These three steps have a mathematical relationship that Sharry does not want to disclose. We do not want energy -equivalents for all things in our b odies. In fact, it may be good to lessen some energy -equivalent sounds; we want to use the energy -equivalent for a longevity gene, but not a cataract gene! In summary, in order to use FEs to assist the body to absorb nutrients and vitamins, three componen ts are required: A prima ry analog frequency comparable to the deficient nutrient or vitamin Energy of the nutrient energy -equivalent A specific rhythm to engage it 126 The software that you receive when you take Sharry's course automatically creates the pro per rhythm. Atomic Mass and Frequency A friend of Sharry's, Ralph Fucetola, compared the work of physicist Max Plank162(a founding father of quantum theory163) with Einstein's famous relativity theory. In the early 1990s, Plank docu mented the connection bet ween the energy of a particle and the frequency of the associated wave. Plank's formula says that:164 Plank's Constant Einstein's Theory of Relativity Energy = H (Plank's constant) F (frequency) Energy = m (mass) c2 (speed of light in a vacuum)2 Both of these formulas are descriptions of energy. Can they be combined? 162 Karl Marx Planck, better known as Max Planck (1858 -1947) was a German physicist . He is considered to be the founder of the quantum theory . 163 Max Planck proposes that empty space is bursting with activity. McTaggart, Lynne. The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, Harper Collins Publishers: New York, 2002. pg. 23. McTaggart. Particles cannot be separated from the empty space around them. Fluctuations in the atomic world amount to a ceaseless back and forth of energ y - like a ball in the game of ping pong. pg. 23. 164 The Planck constant (denoted h), called Planck's constant describes the sizes of quanta in quantum mechanics . It is the proportionality constant between energy (E) of a photon and the frequency of its associated electromagnetic wave (). Planck correctly hypothesized that some types of energy could not take on any indiscriminate value: instead, the energy must be some multiple of a very small quantity (later to be named a \" quantum \"). This is counterintuitive in the everyday world, where it is possible to \"make things a little bit hotter\" or \"move things a little bit faster, but the quanta of energy are very, very small. Nevertheless, it is impossible, as Planck found out, to explain some phenomena without accepting that energy is discrete : that is to say like the integers 1, 2, 3... instead of the line of all possible numbers. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck ; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant 127 HF = mc2 or Plank's constant multiplied by frequency = mass times (speed of light)2 Plank's constant and the speed of light are constant, but frequency and mass vary. BioAcousti c enthusiasts believe that frequency is related to atomic mass. Does a relationship exist between frequency and mass? Does one exist between frequency and energy? Sharry can hear an element and mechanically calculate its frequency using her voice. After c onducting experiments with many elements, she concluded that the mass of the element was close to the frequency of the sound that she heard emanating from i t. She used the frequencies of atomic weights in her earlier computer programs. Now she uses a more effective system of calculating body frequencies. Not wanting to publicize trade secrets, she declined to describe this new system. There is an additional consideration when combining frequenc y formulations . Western society classifies illnesses separatel y and there is little discussion of the impact of one health problem on the other. With BioAcoustics we can look at one pattern of frequencies and see how a fault in one pattern interacts with others patterns, sometimes causing chain reactions with add itional negative implications. Fixing a FE in the middle of a harmonic pattern may only create temporary relief if we don't correct the initial f requency fault that creates cascading intonation issues. In these cases symptoms dissipate wh ile listening to cer tain sounds but will reoccur if the root FE problem is not corrected. Health problems in the body can interact. Suppose someone has a back problem, t emporomandibular joint (TMJ) and a liver problem. If these issues are related by octaves or in the same harmonic series, then only the root cause needs to be corrected for all three to improve. After the root problem is identified and corrected, the others correct themselves like cascading dominoes. Unfortunately, if one of the three problems is corrected, a nd it is not the root cause, this correction will be temporary. 128 The root issue could be at various levels within the body (or in the electromagnetic spectrum of frequencies) , such as: Physical and structural (like bones and muscles ) Maintenance (such as the heart valves and the replacement of villi in the intestines) Processing (as in kidney filtering and mental and emotional processing) Frequencies must be grouped in a specific manner to target levels of the body. I noted that the materials in the above categories vary in density. The denser an object is, the harder it is for a sound to impact it. As a substance becomes denser, higher energy or frequency is required to influence it. Sharry's software, Svani , available only to advanced practitioners , creates a prototype of many harmonic formulations that allows one to determine root causes of cascading frequency issues . Chapter Six Pursuit of Scientific Development DNA and String Theory Watching FEs combine and transform in the body gave Sharry insights into an inherent riddle associated with modern string theory, a developing branch of theoretical physics .165 165 String theory is a developing branch of theoretical physics that combine s quantum mechanics and general relativity into a quantum theory of gravity . The string s in string theory are one - dimensional oscillating lines, but they are no longer considered fundamental to the theory, which can be formulated with points or surfaces. There are many string theories. String theory itself comes in many different formulatio ns, each one has a different mathematical structure and each best describes different physical circumstances. One shared property of these theories is the holographic principle . Another shared principle is tha t some include the standard model of particle physics . This leads many physicists to believe that the theory is the correct fundamental description of nature. In particular, string theory is the f irst candidate for the theory of 129 There are different mathematical models explaining string theories, but they all describe th e natural forces (gravitational , electromagnetic , weak and strong interactions) and matter (quarks and leptons ) in a mathematical system. In string theory, elementary particles are infinitesimal ly small , one - dimensional, string -like objects ra ther than dimensionless points in space -time. According to modern string theory, t hings that were formerly thought to be elementary particles, such as electrons and quarks, are now mathematically shown to be different vibrations on a string. One type of vibration on a string produces a quark. A different vibration on a string creates another elementary particle. As we are all aware, d ifferent musical notes can be created on a string belonging to a musical instrument. Perhaps a string can vibrate in different excitation modes just as a guitar string can produce different notes.166 In string theory and in guitar playing, the string must be stretched with tension in order to become excited or vibrated. The strings in string theory are floating in space -time, not tied down to a guitar. Nonetheless, they have tension.167 Relativistic quantum field theory (the quantum -mechanical theories whose changeable variables are space and time) describes observed behaviors and properties of elementary particles, but current theories only work when gravity is so weak that it is almost nonexistent. Similarly, particle theory (the branch of physics that studies subatomic particles and their interactions) only work s when we pretend gravity doe s not exist. String theory is believed to close this gap. In the 1980s, string theory became popular when it provided a quantum field theory that could describe gravity and electromagnetic forces.168 String theory sensibly describes a string excitation that everything , a way to describe all the known natural forces (gravitational , electromagnetic , weak and strong interactions) and matter (quarks and leptons ) in a http://www.answers.com/topic/string -theory 168 Answers .com http://www.answers.com/topic/string -theory 130 carries the specific gravitational force. This was a great victory for late 20th century physics.169 Sharry suggests that that DNA could be likened to a string and RNA could be an excitation mode on the string that produces a result. RNA can be likened to workers while DNA is analogous to instructions or blueprints . When a child cuts his finger, the RNA worker cells build scaffolding to maintain cell shape,170 acting as adhesion for other materials, and bring ing in blood. RNA cells insure that the repair process is carried out as the wound heals. DNA contains genetic instructions used in the dev elopment and functioning of living organisms . DNA is often compared to a set of blueprints , a recipe, or a code - it contains the instructions for repairs. One of the greatest mysteries of biology is how organs and systems evolve in the body. Modern scientists mostly understand how we have blues eyes or grow to be six feet tall. What is rather elusive is how cells know where to place themselves in eac h stage of the building process so that an arm becomes an arm rather than a leg. Scientists question how these cells organize and assemble into something resembling a three -dimensional human being.171 In The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe , McTagga rt reflects on this idea, Geneticists appreciate that cell differentiation utterly depends on cells knowing how to differentiate early on and then somehow remembering that they are dif ferent and passing on this vital piece of information to subsequent generations of cells. Scientists shrug their shoulders as to how this might all be accomplished, particular at such a rapid pace.172 169 http://www.superstringtheory.com/basics/basic3.html 170 RNA controls th e pattern of frequency and in doing so it regulates protein synthesis and genetic information. A gene is the basic unit of heredity in a living organism . All living things depend on genes to hold the information to build and maintain their cells and to pass on th eir traits to offspring. Proteins are made of amino acids arranged in a linear chain. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is defined by information encoded in a gene. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions that are vital to metabolism . Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions and form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. Other proteins are important in cell signaling , immune responses , cell adhesion and the cell cycle s. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA 171McTaggart , Lynne . The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, Harper Collins Publisher: N.Y., 2002, pg. 44. 172 McTaggart, Lynne. The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force o f the Universe, Harper Collins Publisher: N.Y., 2002, pg. 46. 131 To answer this question, many biologists and physicist s have advanced the idea that radiation and oscillating waves are responsible for synchronizing cell division and sending chromosomal instructions around the body.173 They theorize that frequency or vibration may be involved in the answer. Herbert Frohlich, from the University of Liverpool, who received a Max Plank Medal, introduced the idea that some sort of collective vibration was responsible for getting proteins to cooperate with each other and carry out instructions of DNA and cellular protein.174 The p hysicist, Popp, found that DNA sent out a large range of frequencies and that some frequencies appeared to be linked to certain functions ,175 suggesting that vibrations provide some sort of communication. Vibrational speeds of the elements vary in the Perio dic Table of Elements. Two Cornell physics graduate students, Barry Stripe and Mohammad Rezaei, reported in the June 1998 issue of Science that each atom has a signature energy level that can be used to identify molecules and unknown chemicals by measurin g the vibrational signatures.176 McTaggart suggests that DNA can be likened to the master tuning fork in the body. It could strike a particular frequency and certain other molecules would carry out its instructions. Does the RNA sonically read the DNA bl ueprint? Sharry hints that perhaps the findings from BioAcoustic math and a more advanced string theory could create a working model or theory explaining how things become structure. Sharry observes that a s different chemicals in the body combine, so do t heir frequencies. In BioAcoustics, one can observe RNA frequencies combining with other frequencies of substances and watch the waves transform again and again. For example, BioAcoustically speaking, the FE of oxygen 173 McTaggart, Lynne. The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, Harper Collins Publisher: N.Y., 2002, pg. 48. 174 McTaggart, Lynne. The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force of th e Universe, Harper Collins Publisher: N.Y., 2002, pg. 49. 175 McTaggart, Lynne.

This frequency bumps into other things and continually transforms. After about the tenth round of transformations it becomes a hormone. Using the math of BioAcoustics, one can watch elements and compounds for ming. We can observe the structure of things form and watch the underlying mathematical equations of frequencies being displayed. Research We can learn about body processes by observing The Great Mathematician (our body) doing its work and gather p otential breakthrough ideas for testing. A scientist can translat e a human biological theor y into frequencies and observe the process and results of his theory . It is a relatively cost effective and quick method . If the frequencies and math support the the ory, it pay s the scientist to invest the time and money to conduct a full scientific experiment. Why not stack the deck in your favor? Here's an example. Autistic children's voiceprints pinpo int the presence of a thermasol which is an ingredient of a DPT vaccination (for diphtheria , whooping cough and tetanus ). BioAcoustic observations show that sometimes this chemical appears to destroy the body 's ability to utilize vitamin A which can a ct like a toxin. Collaborating information reveals that in all cases of autistic disorder the person has received a DPT vaccination.177 It is worth investigating the connection between thermasol and autistic disorder. Could future suffering from autistic dis order be eliminated? If more BioAcoustic results were studied with the scientific method, veracity would be given to this emerging science and these findings could catapult our progr ess toward eradicating diseases and help us to understand our emotions , minds and bodies better. 177 Tenpenny, Dr. Sherri. Saying No to Vaccines . NMA Media Press, Quote from Dr. Mayer Eisenstein MD JD. Back cover . 133 178Rudolf Steiner, a great mystic and scholar in the last century, commented on artificial sugars. Chemically derived substances are like a synthetic mirror image' of their natural counterparts. A Sampling of Sharry's Vocal Profiling Observations (to be studied scientifically) The frequency for high fructose corn syrup is overabundant in voiceprints of children that exhibit poor concentration. Can research co nnect high fructose corn syrup178 and a child's ability to focus? If our country is serious about improving the educational performance of children, should they investigate nutritional guidelines for children, especially the school lunch menus? Sharry obs erves that FEs of natural foods and herbs facilitate vocal coherence. The FEs of manmade synthetic medicine does not create vocal coherence, but negative side effects and harmonic imbalances. The impact of manmade substances that we consume can be studied by observing how these FEs alter body processes. For example, fibromyalgia is associated with the FEs of stored drug deposits (prescription or otherwise) in muscle tissues. Can this be evaluated? Can we prevent fibromyalgia? When sperm combines with an egg, the chemical ATP is produced. The FE of ATP is an octave of the FE of white light. Much of the body's ATP is stored in the eyes. When we die, the ATP breaks down and many people see white lights on their deathbeds. It is interesting that white light F E is created at conception and people often see white light during the dying process. Is this phenomenon at death due to the breakdown of ATP in the eyes at death? Does this chemical process explain the spiritual event of seeing white light during a near d eath experience? 134 Their origin lies in the physical world with no relationship to the realm of life forces. Synthetic sugars are cut off from living influences. Some mystics suggest that these shadow foods deplete our soul. Steiner reported that there has been a gradual descent of using sugar from the flower of a plant (honey) to the stem (sugar cane) to the root (beet sugar). According to spiritual science the plant has an inverted affect on people, with the root affecting the head forces. When the head is not balanced with the heart, materialism flouri shes in a civilization, according to Steiner. Francke, Sylvia. The Tree of Life and the Holy Grail, Temple Lodge: England, 2007. pgs. 106 -107. As an adult Sharry created weekly sonic formulas to maintain vocal coherence. Surprisingly, her feet grew two shoe sizes and she also grew two inches in height. What is the relationship between balanced vocal coherence and human growth ? The mummies of the ancient Egyptians stand no bigger than four feet tall. My feet would have hung out of the beds made during the American Revolution. My children tower over me and I was taller than my mother. What is the science behind an increased size of populations? Is there a connection between improvements in consciousness (overall health of thinking, feeling and physical health) as measured by vocal coherence and the size of the physical body that stores that consciousness? If two people are bot h missing the same notes and using the same brain hemisphere, they experience personal friction and can repel each other like poles of a magnet . They are attracted when they use opposite sides of their brain. Could this information be confirmed and then us ed in relationship counseling? Sharry observed that when an autistic child with savant genius recovered from autistic disorder, she lost a great deal of her savant genius. Can studies be devised to understand the link between savant genius and autistic disorder? Voiceprints have shown that FEs created by fluorescent lights are associated with prostate cancer. Can research validate this connection? 135 The addition and subtraction of frequencies sometimes yields unexpected results. Since these equatio ns do not mirror chemical equations, what is the explanation of them? Do these frequency equations prepare the way for discoveries? A few examples are: Oxygen + hydrogen = nitrogen Nitrogen + hydrogen = nitric oxide (cell respiration) and sex hormones Oxygen - hydrogen = ATP (the first chemical created after conception) Carbon - hydrogen = vitamin C (a vitamin not produced by humans) Water - oxygen = hydrogen At a government facility, Sharry sang to three vegetables, which quickly dehydrated. Resea rchers attempted to calculate frequencies to preserve food by dehydration. The researchers produced a sine wave similar to Sharry's voice and then exposed the vegetables to it, but the vegetables eventually decayed. The only known variable between the soun ds that Sharry and a machine can create is her pattern of harmonics. (Ohio University's sound lab verified the unique harmonics in Sharry's voice: intervals 3, 6, and 9 notes apart .) Could we preserve food by exposing it to this pattern of harmonics? Could exact birth times be determined by monitoring voiceprints for hormone levels of expectant mothers? People with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy BioAcoustically show an inability to utilize choline. Could this disorder be treated with energy -equivalen t levels of choline? Certain sounds repel insects. Could we use sounds instead of pesticides that are harmful to our environment? 136 Sound health discoveries may not be taken seriously without research to confirm the wealth of information being disco vered. Even if a sampling of Sharry's observations were tested and proven, the credibility of BioAcoustics could spread and allow more people to reap its benefits. Once these findings have been verified, the diagnostic feature of BioAcoustics could becom e widely used. Given the ever -increasing health care costs, which are now two trillion dollars a year in the United States, why overlook BioAcoustic's relatively inexpensive benefits? Chapter Seven Musical Scales Most people think that all musical s cales use the same notes. This could not be farther from the truth. Western music only uses the notes that we hear on the piano, so easily we assume that all notes are the same. Other scales assign different frequencies to notes. For example, Hindi music has numerous variations of the note G: G+ and G++. Other scales, which are not used in the Western Hemisphere's musical system, use different frequencies and also varied intervals between notes which affect us differently - physically, mentally and emotio nally . Throughou t history many scales were used; in fact, the scales were selected because of the effects that they produced on listeners. Many have even attributed the characteristics of a culture to the scale they listened to. The Western equal -tempera ment scale is equated to aural caffeine as its intervals stimulate activity.179 These advocates also claim that listening to Western music , which stimulates activity , preceded the in dustrial advances in countries like the USA, Europe, Japan, China and Indi a. 179 From an article on the Internet (http://home.eart hlink.net/ -kgann/tuning/html ) that describes the differences between just intonation and the equal temperament scale. 137 Earlier scales employed mathematics to create consonant sounding intervals from wh ole number ratios between notes . The equal - temperament scale modifies intervals so that musicians can conveniently go from one key to another, but this is at the expense of the natural consonance or harmony that other scales can create. Listening to calming musical scales is reputed to support the advanced meditation practices of Eastern cultures . In addition to using different scales, ancient Eastern music utilizes modes. Modes use many frequencies and scales that are not available on our pianos. The ancient modal system of music selects a group of notes to create a specific mood that impacts a person in a unique way. Often intervals of octaves, fourths and fifths (with consonant whole number ratios ) are included. A modal song is comprised of these exclusive notes, but the notes can be replicated in any order or rhythm. This method not only creates a special mood but also , pours a good dose of these frequencies into the listener's body. Ancient and Eastern musical scales have mathematical relationships between notes that Westerners do not experience. Often these scales are derived from mathematical equations reflecting nature's patterns. Johannes Kepler, a 16th centur y scientist,180 formed a musical scale by calculating the ratios of the planets at their furthest and nearest distances from the sun. He used these ratios to create notes of a musical scale. He believed that copying mathematical patterns found in the heavens and converting these to musical patterns would be beneficial to listeners. Sharry hears the frequencies of various chemical elements and has observed a close correlation between atomic mass and frequency. 180 Johannas Kepler (1571 -1630) was the first person to: correctly explain planetary motion, thereby, becoming founder of celestial mechan ics; investigate the formation of pictures with a pin hole camera; explain the process of vision by refraction within the eye; to formulate eyeglass designing for nearsightedness and farsightedness; explain the use of both eyes for depth perception; descri be real, virtual, upright and inverted images and magnification; explain the principles of how a telescope works; discover the properties of total internal reflection. In addition he: formed the basis of integral calculus, explained that the tides are caus ed by the moon; used stellar parallax caused by the earth's orbit to measure the distance to the stars (the same principle as depth perception). (Today this branch of research is called astrometry.) Kepler suggested that the sun rotates about its axis; der ived the birth year of Christ, that is now universally accepted; derived logarithms purely based on mathematics; and coined the word \"satellite. 138 Sylvia Francke tells us that, A musical scale c an be designed using the mass of elements (and compounds formed from these elements) that are found in the human body - which closely correlates to the diatonic scale181 created by the scientist, Kepler, after his research on planetary orbits.182 Kepler notic ed that the ratios between the planets' extreme angular orbits created equated to harmonic intervals. Kepler's measurements of planetary orbits create ratios similar to those found in just intonation. 183 The Just Intonation Scale184 Just intonation is any s ystem of tuning in which all of the intervals between notes can be represented by ratios of whole numbers. Intervals in the just intonation system are considered to be acoustically pure. Just i ntonation is not a particular scale, nor is it tied to any par ticular musical style. It is, rather, a set of principles, which can be applied to a limited number of musically significant intervals to generate an enormous variety of scales and chords.185 The ratios between the pitches (intervals) , rather than the precis e pitches themselves , can describe a scale. This type of process creates a just intonation scale such as: Note C D E F G A B C Musical Ratio C C/D C/E most often describes music that uses traditional major and minor scales. Diatonic and chromatic ar e terms that characterize scales . Often diatonic refers to musical elements derived from the \"white note scale,\" C -D-E-F-G-A-B. The chromatic scale consists of all semitones . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_scale 182 Francke, Sylvia. The Tree of Life a nd The Holy Grail, Temple Lodge: England, 2007. pg. 201. 183 http://alternativespirituality.suite101.com/article.cfm/sacred_geometry 184 In music, just -intonation is any musical tuning in which the frequencies of notes are related by ratios of whole numbers . Justly tuned intervals are usually written either as ratios, with a colon (for example, 3:2), or as fractions , with a slash (3/2). Although in theory two notes tuned in an a rbitrary frequency ratio such as 1024:927 might be said to be justly tuned, in practice only ratios using quite small numbers are given the name; more complex ratios are often considered to be rational intonation but not necessarily just -intonation. Interv als used are then capable of being more consonant . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation 185 http://www.justintonation.net/primer2.html 186 The chords F -A-C, C-E-G, and G -B-D are just major triads. A -C-E and E -G-B are just minor triads, but D -F-A is not. 186 139 Another way to do this is as follows: Note A B C D E F G A Musical Ratio A A/B A/C number in the ratio represents the greater string length and hence the lower pitch. The ratio for an octave is 2:1; an interval of a fifth 5th is 3:2; an interval of a 4th is 4:3. In the book, Just Intonation Primer , there is a description of these sounds, A formal definition of just intonation may be difficult for the novice to grasp, but the exper ience of listening to intervals is unmistakable. Although it is difficult to describe the special qualities of just intervals to those who have never heard them, words such as clarity, purity, smoothness, and stability come readily to mind. The supposedly consonant intervals and chords of equal temperament, which deviate from simple ratios to varying degrees, sound rough, restless, or muddy in comparison.188 These simple -ratio intervals are \"special relationships\" that the human auditory system is able to d etect from a host of complex stimuli. The human auditory system recognizes them as consonant. Musicians around the world have recognized the significance of listening to notes made from whole -number ratios for at least 5,000 years. The Equal Temperament T uning Scale Early classical pianos used the just -intonation scale . Each piano only played in one key or had numerous pitches for every sharp and flat. The pitch of F# in the key of G was slightly different than the pitch of F # in the key of D. For exam ple, one piano might have th ree 187 The chords D -F-A, A -C-E, and E -G-B are just minor triads and F -A-C and C -E-G are just major triads, but G -B-D is not. 188 Doty, David. The Just Intonation Primer, The Just Intonation Network: San Francisco, CA., 2003. Introduction. 140 different F#s and three C#s and be able to create notes for three different scales. In the equal temperament system of tuning , adjacent notes have identical frequency ratios. An octave is divided into 12 equal steps .189 There is only one pitch for each note, enabling musicians to economically go from one key to another. In the Western Hemisphere, the equal temperament scale is a universal musical language. In 1939 it was adopted as a universal musical scale. The equal temperament scale tempers its notes. For example, G and C are five notes apart. This interval is comprised of t wo notes that create a ratio of 1/5 exactly. Using the equal -temperament system, this interval is slightly less than the 1/5 required for a perfect fifth. This slight reduction (flattening) in frequency is referred to as tempering. It is not possible to tune all intervals of 3rds, 5ths... to their exact ratios (such as 1/5 for fifths) and simultaneously have all octaves come out being exactly in the ratio of 2/0. Pythagoras noted that when whole number ratios are used for intervals the octave is not an exac t ratio of 2/0, but 2/0+.190 In contrast, in equal temperament tuning, the octaves have a ratio of 2/0 and all other notes are tempered. Mystics have criticized the use of the equal -temperament scale because the difference between each note is obtained fr om an averaged figure. They describe the equal -temperament scale as dead rigid images of notes instead of , scales that reflect mathematical patterns found in nature and our bodies. Pythagorean Tuning Pythagoras believed the musical scale mimicked the m ovements of the planets, which he believed, were not elliptical but circular . Pythagorean tuning is a system of musical tuning in which the frequency relationships of all intervals are based on the ratio 3/2, which represe nts an interval of a fifth.191 Thus it is not only a 189 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament 190 The discrepancy between twelve justly tuned fifths (ratio 3:2) compared with seven oc taves (ratio 2:1) is referred to the Pythagorean comma. 191 Pythagorean tuning is based on a stack of perfect fifths , each tuned in the ratio 3:2, the next simplest ratio after 2:1, which is the ratio of an octave . In applying this tuning to the chromatic scale , a problem arises: no number of 3:2s fits exactly into an octave . Because of this, the G, 141 mathematically elegant system, but also one of the easiest to tune by ear. Its name comes from medieval texts that attribute its discovery to Pythagoras , but its use has been documented as long ago as 3500 B.C. in Babylonian texts. It is the oldest way of tuning the 12 -note chromatic scale . Since all intervals have integer (whole number) ratios based on the powers of two and three, Pythagorean tuning is also one variety of just intonation.192 Pythagorean tuning is characterized by con sonant octaves, perfect fourths and perfect fifths, based on ratios of the numbers one, two, three and four. All other intervals in Pythagorean tuning are dissonant.193 To derive a complete chromatic scale of the kind common on keyboards by around 1300, we take a series of 11 per fect fifths: Eb , Bb, F, C, G, D, A, E, B, F#, C# and G#.194 A color represents a range of FEs or, hues of the same shade. For example red can range from red orange to red purple. Musical scales can select from a variety of pitches t hat fall within a color r ange. Different octaves within our body and /or different body systems can use various scales and pitch variations. Different scales are comprised of notes created from a variety of frequencies. One color can encompass a range of frequencies or several no tes. When superimposing one just intonation s cale on the color wheel, the complementary pigment color is directly across the color wheel. When a Pythagorean scale is overlaid on a color wheel, the note directly across the circle is not the complementary co lor, but one color adjacent to the complementary color. Likewise, when mixing lights, as opposed to pigments, the complementary colors are also across the pigment color wheel and adjacent one hue. There separat ed by twelve fifths from the A, is about a quarter of a semitone sharper. This is known as the Pythagorean comma. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_comma 192 http://www.music.sc.edu/fs/bain/atmi02/pst/index.html 193 http://www.justintonation.net/primer2.html 194 The one potential flaw of this system is that the fourth or fifth between the extreme notes of the series, Eb -G#, will be out of tune: in the col orful language of intonation, a \"wolf\" interval. This complication arises because 12 perfect fifths do not round off to precisely an even octave, but exceed it by a small ratio known as a Pythagorean comma (see Section 4). Happily, since Eb and G# rarely g et used together in medieval harmony, this is hardly a practical problem. http://www.music.sc.edu/fs/bain/atmi02/pst/index.html 142 appears to be a correlation between complementary lig ht colors and Pythagorean tuning. Just I ntonation Complementary Colors Pythagorean Tuning Complementary Colors Red and Green Cyan (blue/green) and Red Orange and Blue Orange and Cyan Blue and Orange Blue and Red/Orange Purple and Yellow Purple and Orange/Yellow The Solfeggio Scale In Healing Codes for a Biological Apocalypse Horowitz and Puleo, claim that the ancient Solfeggio tones vibrate the exact frequencies required to transform spirit to matter or matter to spirit.195 They also write th at the Solfeggio tones are capable of spiritually inspiring humankind to be more Godlike. 196 This book unveils a pattern of numbers encoded in the Bible: Numbers 7:12-89, that can be converted into frequencies. The content of this seemingly unimportant t ext is about mundane activities that occurred on different days. The Pythagorean skein197 is then applied to the numbers of the verses associated with different days. For example, the text describing the first day is on verse 12, which has a Pythagorean skei n of 12, or 1+2 = 3. The second day starts on verse 18, or 1 +8 = 9. The third day is located on verse 24, or 2 + 4 = 6. These three sums, 3, 9, and 6, create the first set of numbers of the Solfeggio scale . When you apply the same process to the rest of t he chapter you get the following set of numbers: Solfeggio Scale198 1st set = 396 hertz 2nd set = 417 hertz 3rd set = 528 hertz 4th set = 639 hertz 195 Joseph Puleo and Leonard Horowitz, Healing Codes for a Bi ological Apocalypse, Tetrahedron Publishing Co.: Idaho, 2001, pg. 59. 196 Joseph Puleo and Leonard Horowitz, Healing Codes for a Biological Apocalypse, Tetrahedron Publishing Co.: Idaho, 2001, pg. 61. 197 In the system of the Pythagorean skein, individual numb ers are added up and ultimately reduced to the numbers 1 through 9. For example, with the number 245, 2 + 4 + 5 = 11 . With the number 11, 1 + 1 = 2. The Pythagorean skein for the number 245 is 2. 198 Notice the numerical pattern in the ones, tens and hundre ds column. 143 5th set = 741 hertz 6th set = 852 hertz (These tones are not in our musical scales or p ianos.) David Hulse from SomaEnergetics199 developed a teacher certification program using the Solfeggio frequencies for healing benefits. He described the benefits of listening to this scale after researching their benefits in history and confirming the benefits through thousands of sessions. The Benefits of the Solfeggio Scale Turn grief into joy (396 hertz frequency). The first Solfeggio tone liberates energy, eliminating hidden blockages and subconscious negative beliefs. Connect people to the Source (417 hertz). This tone helps people to change. Repair DNA (528 hertz). This frequency brings transformation and miracles into our life. This frequency repair s broken DNA, the genetic blueprint upon which life is based .200 Connect people to spiritual family (639 hertz). This frequency create s harmony in relationships. Solve problems and increase intuition (741 hertz). This tone gives us power of self -expression to be who we really are. Return people to spiritual order (852 hertz). This frequency links the min d, body, insight, consciousness and spiritual evolution. The sounds of the Solfeggio scale are embedded in my Paint Your Soul CD. Tuning forks were made to replicate these pitches and they twinkle in the background of this sonorous music. 199 SomaEnergetics (Soma meaning, \"body\" in the original Greek) are sound therapies utilizing tuning forks tuned to the frequencies of the Ancient Solfeggio scales. These therapies release blockages in the energy bodies and assist one with connect ing with Source. 200 http://orgoneproducts.org/blog/2008/04/02/ancient -solfeggio -frequencies -528-hz-dna-repair/ 144 Here are a f ew comments on the Paint Your Soul CD with the Solfeggio tones p laying softly in the background: \"As I listen to your music for the very first time, I felt it immediately begin to minister love, peace and well -being to every cell in my body.

Sharry can hear notes in a person's body and then match tones to the unique musical scale created by each body. Her practitioners are able to prescribe accurate tones that are unique to individuals because the FFTs precisely identify which frequencies a body needs. Finding the exact scale and individual tones that the body requires is critical. Sharry describes a woman with hyperostosis (an overgrowth of bone). This woman's body could not utilize calcium and she built up calcium deposits. The frequency of calcium her body needed was slightly different than what other people could ingest and utilize as calcium . A vo iceprint revealed that the precise frequency of calcium that she uniquely needed was an isotope of calcium. Isotopes are different types of atoms of the same chemical element , having a different atomic mass. Isotopes have nuclei with the same number of protons , but different numbers of neutrons . Isotopes can be illustrated by the process of mak ing biscuits . When a recipe calls for baking soda, flour and salt and t he ingredients are not mixed wel l, one biscuit may have more salt than the others . This biscuit represents an isotope. Although the woman in our example had taken over the counter calcium supplements, none of them helped. Only when she was given the appropriate FE for the isotope of calcium that her body needed - was she able to utilize it alleviat ing her symptoms. In summary, the scale used in the Western Hemisphere only uses select frequencies. More scales are available that mirror patterns found in nature and reflect a math that underline s our world. In antiquity , different scales and music w ere created to mimic nature and it was discover ed that mathematical patterns affect our co nsciousness. Special music was the key to developing character, virtue, and spiritual evolvement in ancient Greek and Chinese musical thought. Pythagoras lived roughly 570 - 500 BC, and believed that the cosmos was governed by numbers.201 By using the appropriate numbers 201 Ferguson, Kitty. The Music of Pythagoras , Walker and Co: N .Y., 2008. pg. 151. 146 beneath music one coul d restore harmonious equilibrium. Kitty Ferguson , who wrote The Music of Pythagoras , tells us, One Pythagorean theme was to find the underlying mathematical structure of the world and use the power of mathematics to unlock its secrets.202 In the final analysis, music was a set of numbers. Our bodies each have their own unique musical scale. Sharry discovered that many of us (but not all) use a scale similar to the just intonation scale. Chapter Eight Rhythm in t he Body In the womb, our ears are one of the first organs to develop. We hear our first communication from the rhythm of our mother's heartbeat. We receive reassurance through a steady rhythm all throughout our lives. Hearing is one of the last senses tha t we lose when we die. The human body can be compared to an orchestra, with the heart drumming the constant beat under normal circumstances. David Burrows reflects on the unconscious modeling of life in music, Music's movements mime the striding, the le aping, the rocking motion, the twisting and turning of the human organism in its landscape and in its mindscape. In musicking' we model sensations of expansion and contraction, intensification, slowing and accelerating, detached from the roots of such sen sations in daily living.203 Rhythm affects our pulse, heart rate, breath and stress response. It can influenc e the pace of our voice, stride and activities. A rhythm can increase or decrease our energy. Various beats and pulses strengthen the elasticity of our internal rhythms, helping us gain vitality. 202 Ferguson, Kitty. The Music of Pythagoras , Walker and Co: N .Y., 2008. pg. 130. 203 Burrows, David. Time and the Warm Body: A Musical Perspective on the Construction of Time, Brill: Boston, 2007. pg. 68. 147 There is more power in rhythm than we realize. Harmony and frequency are only a portion of the equation that can improve our mind, emotions and bodies. We need the proper rhythm as well. Michael Thaut,204 in his book about scientific foundations for rhythm, music and the brain, states, The brain is neurologically superbly sensitive to processing the time elements in music in a rapid, precise and meaningful manner.205 Rhythm is an extremely important element t hat orchestrates the body's music! Thaut describes rhythm as creating the major syntax and grammar of time in music.206 He further adds that rhythm translates the perception of time not like pulsing ticks of a stop watch, b ut as frequency patter ns unfoldi ng horizontally in time.207 One can view this in a voiceprint and observe patterns in pitch and rhythm. Haut continues that, Rhythm in music translates the perception of time into a sensory language. 208 Thaut continue s, The recent body of brain research shows impressively that sensory experiences change the brain...developing neuronal architecture - the wiring scheme of the brain - into a more and more diverse and efficient executive system. 209 Clearly rhythm is an important component of the music within our bodies. Rhythm provides patterns or pulses that are irregular or periodic. Our motor and nervous systems are sensitive to and quickly aroused by rhythm. Rhythm can make us dance in a frenzy or slow our hearts down. Rhythm sets the mood of a song, a s wel l as animating a sometimes lackluster melody. Rap music is the ultimate example of this. The rap melody repeats the same note over and over, while people groove on the rhythm! 204 Michael Thaut is vice president of the International Society for Music and Medicine. He received the National Rese arch A ward from the American Musical T herapy Association. 205 Thaut, Michael.

The tempo (Italian for time and mo vement) dictates the speed of periodic beats. This affects the mood of a piece and our energy levels as well. Fast tempos create energy, while depression or a peaceful meditation can be facilitated from slow tempos. In the body, the heart controls the temp o. Our heart races when we are frightened and slows down in a peaceful meditation. Our own rhythms can be a more complete expression of who we are than we realize. Watch people' s varied ways of walking on a busy street. Some people bounce, others shuffle and a few march. Some are rigid, others flexible. Other variations include : jerkiness versus regularity of rhythm, or a calm rhythm versus a rushed one. Our personality and emotions can be reflected in the rhythm of our walk. Words have rhythm. Languages have rhythm and tempos . The rate of speaking and associated movements often depicts the underlining meaning of our words. Our words may say one thing, while our rhythm of words and body language can say another, revealing a deeper truth. Rhythm patterns c reate characteristic feelings. A pattern of two beats mimic s walking or marching and creates a feeling of a straight line . A pattern of three beats feels softer and directs energy inward. The 3 - beat pattern is used for waltzes in which the dancers spiral a round on the dance floor. Rhythm expresses our own energy. Reinhard Flatischler, who developed a revolutionary approach to rhythm that combined pulse, breath, voice and rhythm,210reflects on the power of rhythm. The drum returns my energy by translating it into audible rhythm and thus completes a circuit of energy that allows me to connect with my own power. African and American Indian tra ditions use drumming to induce shamanic journeys to cure physical, mental and emotional problems. I have a CD of Afric an witchcraft music. On the inside cover, the Africans expressed sympathy for all Westerners who do not have access to their profound, healing rhythmic modalities. These Africans 210Flatischler, Reinhard. The Forgotten Power of Rhythm, Taket ina: Mendocino, CA., 1992. 149 pitied Westerners who used hospitals and medical systems instead of their rhy thmic music ! The Africans value drumming as a greater force , more than mere entertainment. Richard Bartlet, who authored Matrix Energetics , describes how rhythms induce a shamanic journey , Repetitive drumming distracts the conscious mind, lulling the l eft brain into relinquishing its stranglehold over the prevailing view of reality. After much practice, temporary right -brain dominance occurs and the process Carl Jung calls active imaginat ion' is allowed free reign. In shamanic lore this is called a jou rney. In these journeys you may encounter mindscapes of a virtual territory of specifically identified terrain, which have been mapped out by conscious explorers for many cultures for thousands of years.211 Daniel Levitin gives another explanation for chan ges in consciousness induced by rhythm, Music with rhythmic elements - played on drums, rain sticks, shakers, shells, stones, sticks, and hand claps -typically takes on a more regular, hypnotic quality that can induce trance states. Just how music induces trance states is not known, but it seems to be related to the relentless rhythmic momentum, coupled with a solid, predictable beat. When the beat is predictable neural circuits in the basal ganglia (the habit and motor ritual circuits , as well as regions of the cerebellum t hat connect to it, become entrained by the music . Neurons fire synchronously with the beat. This in turn shifts brain wave patterns, easing us into an altered state of consciousness that may resemble the onset of sleep, or the netherworl d between sleep and wakefulness, or even a drug -like state of heightened concentration couple d with increased relaxation of the muscle and a loss of awareness of time and place.212 Repetition numbs our bondage to reality, opening us up to higher levels of consciousness. Hazrat Inyat Khan was a teacher from India who started a Sufi Order in the West. He said, When the rhythm in the body is disturbed it can lead to illness, because it disturbs the whole mechanism that is going on, the order of which depends of the regularity of the rhythm. When a person suddenly hears something that causes fe ar, his rhythm is 211 Bartlett, Richard.

The World in Six Songs: How the Musical Brain Created Human Nat ure, Penguin Group: N .Y., 2009 . pgs. 213 -214. 150 broken and pulsation changes. Every shock a person receives breaks his rhythm. Once the rhythm is broken, it is most difficult to get it right again... T he rhythm should be regained in a gradual process.213 Thaut suggests four applications of music and rhythm; Rhythmic stimulations have profound effects on motor control, speech, physiological and behavior functions. Rhythm can enhance learning, perception and language. Music can be used as an alternate transmission route for information in the brain. Music is a powerful emotional stimulus, which affects behavior, learning, perception and memory .214 Rhythms in our Body Rhythm in the body is primarily creat ed from the heart and brain, and these pulses animate the body's frequencies. Each heartbeat carries a frequency, just as each drumbeat creates a pitch. Sharry found that the brain and the heartbeat animate the energy of the body. She also discovered a pit ch that keeps the heart beating in rhythm. Blood is pumped through the body according the rhythm of the heartbeat. Heart rates vary per individual, depending on age and size and other factors, but the average resting human heart rate is about 70 beats pe r minute. Heart rate varies significantly between individuals based on fitness, age and genetics. Other body processes also create body percussion, such as breathing. Dr. Tomatis penned, The vital act of breathing (inhaling and exhaling) follows a rhythm that varies with age, activity, thoracic development, stress and so on.215 Davis examines body pulses from another source. Our brain waves also have their own rhythms and can average a pulse approximately every one tenth of a second.216 213Hazrat was born into a family of musicians in 1882. Khan, Inayat, Hazrat.

Other rhythms in the body are cycles of replacement. Atoms, molecules, tissues, bones, skin, enzymes and cells are constantly being replaced and refurbished over time. The movement and activit ies of our organs and body systems, such as circulation, create c haracteristic sounds and pulses - their own musical songs. All body rhythm patterns interact . Waves generated from all body processes affect the rhythm, pitch and volume of each other.217 Rhythmic patterns within larger patterns of sound are found in our body, just as the geometry of the solar system is reflected in the geometric alignment of our molecular structures. For example, the Fibonacci ratios mirror the ratios found in star systems, our bodies and in small conch shells! Cycles, which are rhythmic patterns, are found throughout the cosmos and inside the human body. For example, a plant unfolds according to a rhythmical process of expansion and contraction.218 Many healthy cyclical patt erns or rhythms in the body reflect nature's cycles. McTaggart discusses frequencies that emanate from our bodies that can interact with our environment, Experiments in the 1940s by neuroanatomist Harold Burr from Yale University mea sured electrical fields around living things. Burr discovered electrical fields around all sorts of organisms - from molds, salamanders and frogs to humans. 217 Davis, Dorinne.

Its rhythms are the equal repeated seasons, The beating of a heart, The going and returning of migratory bird s, The cycles of stars and corn, The mimosa that unfolds by day and folds up by night, The rhythms of moon and tide, And apples that ripen and fall. Melody, accord, arpeggios are the harp of the universe. Unity behind apparent multiplicity. That is the mu sic. Ernesto Cardenal 152 Changes in the electrical charges appeared to correlate with growth, sleep, regeneration, light, wa ter, storms, the development of cancer and even with the waxing and waning of the moon.219 Author David Burrows, in Time and the Warm Body , reflects, Like music, daily life is made up of continuities, such as the circulation of blood, formed of discontinu ities such as the heart beat: or continuities interrupted...like a conversation interrupted by a fire alarm.220 Scientist Fritz Alan Popp measured bio -photon emissions from a healthy student for nine mo nths at the same place in her body. The light emission s followed biological rhythms... Emissions seemed to follow other natural biological rhythms; similarities were noted by day or night, by week, by month as though the body were following the world's biorhythms, as well as its own.221 Cosmic cycles have been compared to a human's breathing rhythms.222 The earth's breathing may be described as the alternating barometric pressure of day and night, or the sunset likened to exhaling and the sunrise to inhaling. The average person inhales 18 times a minute or 1080 ti mes an hour. In a 24 -hour period a person inhales and exhales approximately 25,920 times. This corresponds to the number of years it takes the sun to pass through each of our twelve constellations, a platonic year. Biological cycles also parallel tidal cha nges in the earth's magnetic field and the 28 -day lunar cycle is similar to a 28 -day menstrual cycle.223 The circulatory system of a human being parallels the earth's altern ating temperature differences of day and night, or in winter and summer. Cosmic cyc les and rhythms subtly affect us. Michael Therroux from the Borderland Research Foundation concluded, The human organism is immersed in rhythmic formative force originating in the surrounding cosmos.224 219 McTaggart, Lynne.

Microcosm and Macrocosm, in Rhythmic Fo rmative Forces of Music. 153 Healing Rhythms Hazrat Inayat Khan225 reflects on rhythmic influences: Life is rhythm. Rhythms may be divided into three stages and at every stage this rhythm changes the nature and character of life. One rhythm is mobile, the other is active and the third is chaotic. The mobile rhythm is creative, p roductive, and constructive and through this rhythm all power and inspiration are gained and peace is experienced. The advanced stage of this rhythm, the active rhythm, is the source of success, accomplishment of progress and maturation, the source of joy and fulfillment. And the third stage of this rhythm, the chaotic rhythm, is the source of failure and death, disease and destruction, the source of all pain and sorrow.226 Hazrat In ayat Khan continued to describe the relationship between the body and rhythm. When the body is excited and the breath has lost its rhythm, and becomes irregular and uneven, a chaotic condition is created. When the body has regular circulation, proper rhythm and breath, then a person is capable of doing and accomplishing th ings. When a body is restful, comfortable and relaxed we are able to think; inspirations and revelations come; we feel quiet; we have enthusiasm and power.227 Rhythm within our body is also a communication system that can be likened to M orse code , a system using long and short signals to communicate. The cycles in our bodies create a pulsation that contains more information than just a pulse, just as Morse code communicates more than just pulses. 225 Khan, Inayat, Hazrat (1882 -1927 ) was the founder of Universal Sufism and the Sufi Order International . He initially came to the West as a representative of several traditions of classical Indian music . However, Khan's life missi on was soon revealed to be the introduction and transmission of Sufi thought and practice to the West. 226 Khan, Inayat, Hazrat . The Music of Life , Omega Publishing: New Lebanon, N .Y., 1983. pg. 100. 227 Khan, Inayat, Hazrat . The Music of Life . Omega Publishing: New Lebanon, N.Y., 1983. pg. 100. Humanity is a beautiful breathing instrument of music. Clement of Alexandria 154 Sharry notes that some of our body communication system s par allel Tesla's228 idea of alternating current (AC) . Tesla pointed out the inefficiency of Edison's direct current , (DC). The secret, he felt, lay in the use of alternating current, because to him all energies were cyclic. Why not build generators that would s end electrical energy along distribution lines first one way, than another? Direct current flows continuously in one direction; alternating current changes direction 50 or 60 times per se cond and can be stepped up to ve ry high voltage levels, minimizing po wer loss across great distances. Dr. Becker reports that the more primitive, analog data transmission and control system still exists in the body, located in the perineural cells and transmit information by means of the flow of semiconducting DC electri cal current. 229 He reiterates, A DC analog system of data transmission and control is, in fact, hidden within the central nervous system.230 Not only does our body employ DC current, but AC current as well. Sharry noted that Schwann cells have current run ning in both directions simultaneously, somewhat resembling AC current. Frequencies create rhythm by periodically changing the volume of a note. Imagine a steady tone that gets louder three times a second. This pattern produces a rhythm. A repeated patter n in the volume of sound creates rhythm. Even harmonics, created from every frequency in our body, create a characteristic rhythm that our body is accustomed to. The volume of each successive harmonic note decreases proportionately, creating a rhythmic pat tern. The usual waveform of an AC power circuit is a sine wave . Audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current. In these applications, an important goal is often the recovery of information encoded onto the AC signal. Nerve cells communicate to each other by acting as \"transducers \" creating electrical signals (very small voltages and currents) in response to 228 Nikola Tesla (1856 - 1943) Tesla invented the alternating -current generator that provides light and electricity, the transformer through which it is sent, and even the high voltage coil of a picture tube. The Tesla Coil, in fact, is used in radios, television sets, and a wide range of other electronic equipment - invented in 1891; no -one's ever come up with anything better. 229 Dr. Becker, R obert O.

BioAcoustic Rhythms The sounds that Sharry hears from people reflect rhythmic patterns as well as pitches. When the fre quency dips or rises in a periodic fashion or the volume of pulse changes, a rhythmic pattern is created. Rhythm is created by repeated patterns of loudness and softness among frequencies. BioAcoustic patterns reveal our personal biological rhythms. The architect of the frequencies in a voiceprint displays rhythmic patterns. The voiceprint's overall waveform reflects a portion of a cycle. Sharry has observed a mathematical relationship between frequency and rhythm, which she is retaining as a proprietary secret. She hinted that changing the timing of the frequency formulation allows specific organs to be targeted for intervention. Sharry studied rhythmic patterns of biochemical processes in the body such as the Krebs Digestion cycle by watching biochemi cal frequencies and rhythms change as they interacted. Proper rhythmic patterns of frequencies are essential in order for health to be maintained in the body. If the rhythm of the sound was incorrect then the body will not incorporate the sounds properly . Sharry chooses not to disclose how these rhythmic periods are calculated, but her software utilizes the effective rhythm patterns. Sharry's sonic formulas, called sound presentation s, need to be heard for certain duration to affect positive change. Many healing frequency formulas are presented in 30 to 60 second bursts, but this varies. When working with muscles, the FEs are effective in two - minute cycles. If the sounds are applied too long or too short a duration, then the effect will be incomplete. Rhythm and music have far greater impact than we have previously understood. Research is changing our understanding of music. Thaut summarizes, Based on new directions in brain research, a historical paradigm has occurred, moving music therapy from an interpretive 156 social -science paradigm to a neuroscience paradigm based on music perception. 231 Thaut continues, Many clinical studies have shown striking evidence that auditory rhythm and music can be effectively harnessed for specific therapeutic purposes in the rehabilitation of patients with different neuropathologies. Such findings further underscore the complex ways in which music engages and communicates to the brain and in which the brain that engages in music can be - even in states of brain injury - changed by engaging in music.232 Chapter Nine Frequency Interactions Heart and Brain Interactions The frequencies of brain waves can be likened to melodies, while the heartbea t provides rhythm to animate a song. Melody and rhythm are in sync in p leasing music, and we feel healthy when they are in sync in our body too. The heart provides a rhythmic beat and produces electromagnetic energy. The HeartMath Institute talks about the energy created by the heart. The heart is the most powerful generat or of electromagnetic energy in the human body, producing the largest rhythmic electromagnetic field of any of the body's organs. The heart's electrical field is about 60 times greater in amplitude than the electrical activity generated by the brain.233 This field can be measured with an electrocardiogram. The magnetic field produced by the heart is more than 5,000 times greater in strength than generated by the brain, and can be detected a number of feet away from the body, in all directions.234 (Waves trav el spherically, not as 231 Thaut, Michael. Rhythm, Music and the Brain: Scientific Foundations and Clinical Applications , Routledge: N .Y., 2005, pg. 135 . 232 Thaut, Michael. Rhythm, Music and the Brain: Scientific Foundations and Clinical Applications , Routledge: N .Y., 2005, pg. 58 . 233 www.HeartMath.org/ heart brain connections 234 www.HeartMath.org/ heart brain connections 157 a two -dimensional line representing a sound wave. Sound travels in all directions, creating a sphere that gets continually larger.) The HeartMath Institute gather s scientific information regarding the heart. They report, Traditiona lly, the study of communication pathways between the head and heart has been approached from a rather one -sided perspective, with scientists primarily focusing on the heart's responses to the brain's commands. However, we have now learned that communicatio n between the heart and brain is actually a dynamic, ongoing, two -way dialogue, with each organ continuously influencing the other's function. Research has shown that the heart communicates to the brain in four major ways: neurologically , bio- chemically , biophysically and energetically . Communication along all these conduits significantly affects the brain's activity. Moreover, our research shows that messages that the heart sends to the brain can also affect the brain's performance.235 The energy from the h eart and brain interact through the sonic wave pool of the body . When people experience positive emotions their heart rhythms become more coherent. Steady r hythms that are at the correct tempo also improve heart -brain synchronization. When our brainwaves and heartbeats are in sync, the Heart Math Institute236 indicates that we receive physical and emotional benefits. These signals from the heart may also modify cortical function and influence performance...shifting perception, mental clarity and heightened intuitive awareness.237 When the heart and brain are aligned, we perceive greater wholeness - while solutions to problems come to us easier. The heart -brain link makes sense when one considers th at stresses, anxiety, uncertaint y and fear cause our heart to race. These emotions trigger irregular, chaotic and incoherent rhythmic signals from the heart to the brain. When receiving these signals our brain stops maintenance functions and transfers energy to deal with a dangerous or stressful situation. Conversely , when we feel genuine hope, caring and compassion, our heart sends harmonious and coherent signals to the brain, and then our bodies are nourished and repaired.238 235 www.HeartMath.org/ heart brain connections 236 www.Heartmath.com 237 www.Heartmath.com 238 www.Heartmath.com 158 Sharry has developed a frequency pattern that syncs both the heartbeat and brain waves! Th is frequency that the heart emits keeps it beating in rhythm and entrains brain waves. Although she will not reveal this healing rhythmic pattern or the mathematical association between these two organs, her software creates frequencies and rhythm that pro duce brain -heart synchronization. Nicole LaVoie, who authored Return to Harmony , which describes her sound healing library, reported that each per son has a fundamental frequency or, an average of all the frequencies within his mental, emotional and physic al realms. She writes that the fundamental frequency, or the soul note, is primarily produced when we speak from the heart. When we hum our soul note we connect to source, creating a good time to make decisions. Humming this note brings joy and is empo wering. Nicole reports that singing or hearing this note, one octave lower, releases old energy blockages of core issues that we carry from lifetime to lifetime.239 Listening to a higher octave above this note helps one connect to higher energies and th e higher part of Self.240 In order to facili tate cooperation in groups, Nic ole averages every one's soul notes, and allows the group to entrain to this frequency, producing greater coherence in the group. Our fundamental frequency is an average of all of o ur mental, emotional and physical frequencies. What we do when no one is looking creates FEs - mentally and emotionally. These frequencies become part of our overall fundamental frequency or blueprint that we create throughout our lives. Over time consiste nt emotional and mental frequencies entrain and become incorporated within our physical bodies. Our fundamental frequency is the accumulation of FEs that we have thought, felt and experienced in the physical body. What we do in private is recorded in our internal frequency universe and we live with the ramifications. We so w what we reap literally in a frequency sense. Behaving for the highest good in our secretive and dark experiences serves to bless ourselves . When our FE universe 239 LaVoie, Nicole.

Perhaps, being the best person at all times is our greatest gift to others. Energy Connections Dr. Becker's research indicates that, Magnetic and electromagnetic fields have energy, carry energy and are produced by electrical currents. When we talk about electrical currents flowing in living organisms, we also imply that they are producing magnetic fields that extend outside the body as well and can be influenced by external magnetic fields.241 In the all -pervasive world of frequencies we are not isolated or separate from our environment. The heart's electromagnetic field envelops every cell of our bodies and extends out in all directions around us. The cardiac field can be measured several feet away from the body by sensitive devices. Resea rch shows our heart's field changes distinctly as we experience different emotions. It is registered in people's brains around us and apparently is capable of affecting cells and DNA studied in vitro.242 Interactions can take place between the energy of th e hearts and brains of two people touching or in close proximity. Intriguing research from the HeartMath Institute shows that electromagnetic signals generated by the heart have the capacity to affect others around us. In specific, one person's heartbeat c an be registered in another person's brain waves.243 This communication is stronger when one's heart is generating a coherent rhythm.244 With this method we can intuitively perceive what other people are feeling. Douglas Dean conducted a research study sugges ting that communication at higher energetic frequencies take s place constantly at an unconscious level.245 The conscious personality fails to perceive the interconnectedness of all life at subtle energy levels.

Fritz Alan Popp, a biophysicist from Germany, created a m achine to measure photon emissions from living organisms. We are told by Mc Taggert that, It began to dawn on Popp that these emissions had a purpose outside of the body. Wave resonance wasn't simply being used to communicate within the body, but between living things.247 Author Ted Levintin discusses the role of music in interpersonal communication. In Africa, music is not an art form as much as it is communication. Singing together releases oxytocin, a neurochemical now known to be involved in establish ing bonds of trust between people.248 Levintin probes into studies contrasting music and subconscious interpersonal communication and says , Two individuals who are asked to synchronize their finger tapping on a desk , synchronize more closely than when ask ed to synchronize with a metronome. This may seem counter intuitive, because the metronome is far steadier in its beat and therefore more predictable. But the studies show that humans accommodate one another's performance, a situation of co -adaption. They interact with one ano ther, but not with the metrono me, leading to a greater drive to coordinating.249 Dr. Bittman published a study on the effects of group drumming . He scientifically demonstrated that participation in group drumming increased the activity of specialized white blood cells that destroy cancer cells and virally -infected cells.250 Think about that, the rhythm and connectivity people shared in group drumming sessions improved people's immune system. 246 Dr. Ger ber, Richard.

Clearly vibrations on a subconscious level affect our environment and vice versa . Negative emotions from people coll ectively create electromagnetic fields, generating global stress. Incoherent waves of energy emanate from an individual to those nearby and ultimately can join with negative energies of many people. The feeling or energy can journey around the globe. Globa l stress and incoherence are intensified by instant mass media reports of natural disasters, social upheaval and economic turmoil. During a time of crisis, one can feel the atmosphere of concern, worry and fear. For instance, many have recorded tha t before war erupts in a country, m usic stops and the silence is brimming with feelings of dread. Collectively, positive emotions such as hope, care, compassion and appreciation generate a coherent wave producing a global electromagnetic field. The Global Cohere nce Initiative engages people to project heart -felt compassion, care and love to the world. Many believe this spawns energy that results in new solutions for world problems. It builds a reservoir of positive energy that benefits the planet.252 They suggest that each time a person raises his positive emotional energy - the entire world benefits. By living from your heart and expressing higher emotions you lift the heaviness of the local and global collective frequency realm. Nothing lifts gravity like levity and love.253 The Global Coherence Initiative continues, The scientific community is just beginning to appreciate how living systems and the ionosphere interact with one another. For instance, the earth and the ionosphere generate a symphony of frequenc ies ranging from 0.01 to 300 hertz. Some of the large resonances occurring in the earth's fields are the same as those of the human heart and brain.254 Scientists have discovered that changes in the earth's magnetic field are associated with: changes in t he brain and nervous system, athletic 251www.

The geomagnetic conditions affect the rhythms o f the heart stronger than all the physiological functions studied so far.255 Not only does the Global Coherence Initiative suggest that life is affected by the earth's geomagnetic fields, but that the earth's fields can be affected by human emotions. Two National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration space weather satellites that monitor the earth's geomagnetic field displayed a spike at the time of the 9/11 crisis and for several days thereafter, indicating stress wave s possibly caused by mass human emo tions.256 Regional Energies There are multitudes of frequencies in our environments that collect and influence the sounds that Sharry hears, our health and even global trends. People respond differently to sounds in different geographical locations. A location has its own overall frequency that is composed of energy from people, language, industry, pollution, geology, weather and other influences. These frequencies combine with and affect the local people and their taste in music. Sharry believes th at this energy creates the sounds emanating from the ground that she hears in different locations. For example, she hears a G# coming from the vicinity of Ohio and an A in London. She noted that th e A frequency improved her vision, so much so that she didn't need glasses while in England. Sharry observed that the pitch coming from the ground in the United States, when converted to a color, is the same color as blue jeans, which people in the United States love. She suggests that subtle pitches of a locati on can influence people's color preferences. It seems far -fetched that tones radiate from the ground, but many people can relate to experiencing the absence of such sounds. When a fresh snow has fallen the silence is deeper . Snow muffles subtle 255 Global Coherence Initiative with the Heart -Math Institute 256 Global Coherence Initiative wit h the Heart -Math Institute 163 noises com ing from the earth. In the winter there are also fewer animals and plants contributing to these subtle frequencies that we are not conscious of. Hence, it feels silent and still after the snow falls. We have a famous Christmas caro l associated with snowy w inter called , Silent Night. The average pitch and tempo of a language vary, as well. For example, the average pitch in the French language is about 436 cycles per second and in American English it is 440 cycles per second. The French speak at a lower av eraged pitch than Americans and utilize unique rhythm patterns, tempos and musical inflections. Each language possesses intricate and unique patterns of melody, harmony and rhythm. These vibrations subtly influence the population. An article by Fosar and Blundorf report s that our DNA can be influenced and reprogrammed by words and frequencies.257 According to Russian research , DNA that is not used for building proteins serves as data storage and for communication. The Russian linguists found that genetic co de follows the same rules as our human languages. More specifically, alkalines of our DNA follow grammar and rules similar to those found in languages. They concluded that human languages did not appear coincidentally but are a reflection of our DNA.258 Russian biophysicist and molecular biologist Pjo tr Garjajev reports that living DNA substances (in living tissue, not in vitro) will always react to language -modulated laser rays and even radio waves if the frequencies are correct. It is normal for our DNA t o react to language. This would explain why hypnosis and affirmations can have a strong effect on people. Esoteric teachers have known for ages that our body is programmable by words, thoughts and language. Of course the frequency has to be correct, which explains why not everyone experiences the same degree of success with affirmations and hypnosis.259 257 Fosar, Grazyna and Bludorf, Franz.

According to the find ings of Russian scientists, the genetic code follows the same rules found in human languages. By modulating certain frequency sound patterns onto a laser ray, they were able to influence DNA frequency and genetic information...Perhaps the most interesting co rollary of their discovery is that simple words and phrases may work just as well as laser beams.260 Energy from local soil and rocks contributes to local electromagnetic fields. The energy emanating from a granite rock is different than from quartz, shale or sand. Minerals found in rocks have unique universal frequency -equivalents . Further, the earth's molten iron core generates the magnetic field around the planet. In summary, geological factors create energy in a location, which subtly affects us. Being at the beach feels different ly, than spending time in New York City or Siberia . Another contributing factor to regional energy fields is the frequency of electrical currents utilized in a country (electrical/magnetic frequencies from cell phones, TVs, mic rowaves...). These currents are different in various count ries. For example, in the United States electricity is delivered at 60 hertz and in the United Kingdom it is delivered at 50 hertz. Color influences individuals. Energies from color contribute to a feeling of a specific location. For example, a desert feels different than a seaport. The desert -scape includes yellows and browns, while the seascape boasts of blues and greens. The color of the landscape is one of many factors contributing to a local atmosphere, which subtly affects the people there. A friend of mine co nducted an experiment with Kirli an photography,261 which records a visual representation of energy. He 260 Mary Desaulniers. Article found at : www.suite101. com/writer_articles.cfm/mdesaulniers , 2010. 261 Aura Cameras are used to give individuals a visual representation of their bioenergetic state. Based on such biofeedback technologies and galvanic skin response and skin temperature, aura cameras measure thes e physiological inputs and then convert this information into digital displays through a computer interface. The resulting display is typically a depiction of what is traditionally known as the human aura and chakra. Kirlian photography refers to a form of 165 took repeated Kirlian photographs of the same person at almost the same time with th e only difference being the color of clothes that she was wearing. This single difference produced a change in the colors of the person's bioenergies in the resulting Kirlian photograph s. The jungle feels different ly than a desert, reflecting various lev els of moisture in the air. I can smell and feel a large body of water, such as a river, lake or ocean before I see it. Different weather patterns, including amount of sunshine, precipitation, wind, temperature and barometric pressure also contribute to local energy fields. Another example of environmental energy is created by the earth's rotation, which continuously creates electromagnetic impulses called spherics that have a determining effect on our weather.262 Spherics can also modify the structure of protein molecules.263 Sunlight and sunspots also influence the earth's electromagnetic energies. Electromagnetic waves from our air interact with sound and other factors. Sound propagates in the air at the rate of approximately 700 miles per hour, dependi ng on air pressure and temperature. This process involves countless collisions between the atoms and the molecules that form the earth's atmosphere. Each collision creates friction between the air components, resulting in heat, more accurately described as electromagnetism. The amplitude of the electromagnetism is a function of the sound pressure level, the local temperature and air pressure, the latter dictating the number of collisions that occur.264 There are two variables of sound -generated electromagnet ism: frequency and what the frequency travels through and interacts with, such as weather conditions. Analog signals, being identical (analogous) to electrical signals generated in nature, are highly susceptible to interference from natural phenomenon (such as weather and sunspots). photogram made with a high voltage. It is named after Semyon Kirlian, who in 1939 accidentally discovered that if an object on a photographic plate is connected to a source of high voltage, small corona discharges (created by the strong electric field at the edges of the object) create an image on the photographic plate. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirlian_photography 262 Cousto, Hans.

Journal of Subtle Energies and Energy Medici ne, Vol. 17, number three. 166 Environmental electromagnetic waves interact with humans. Davis underscores this point, The Schumann Resonance theory suggests that the entire (human) body vibrates at the fundamental frequency of approximately eight cycles per second in a relaxed state (same as an alpha brain wave)... The earth also vibrates at this frequency. As a result, a synergistic relationship develops between the charged layers of the earth's atmosphere and the human body.265 Davis continues, Similarly, the energy fields around a tree change in advance of weather patterns and other atmospheric conditions. If weather disturbances affect the earth's atmosphere, perhaps it also account s for the behavioral changes seen in some learning disabled children prior to certain types of storms.266 Pollution, noise levels and types of industry activity impact the local energy fields. Further, the characteristic attitudes of people contribute energy to these large wave pools. The people of Japan, New York City and rural Appalachia all create different local energy fields. Also, one can feel or sense the difference between a friendly place and one in which you are not welcomed. History can contrib ute to the local energy -pool. Sites of historical atrocities (such as Auschwitz, Germany and Gettysburg, USA) emanate a chilling and somber feeling, which correlate to horrible energies that people felt there at an earlier time. Likewise, people travel to sacred sites, churches and mosques as they crave the holy and uplifting feelings associated with these places. Motorola Corporation published a listing of recorded sounds coming from space. For over ten years they recorded these daily subtle sounds. These frequencies change throughout the day. Different frequencies recorded from space interact with frequencies in our bodies. Different organs, body parts and body processes have varying densities (such as brain waves versus bones) and different frequencies . The incoming sounds affect them differently. External 265 Davis, Dorinne. Sound Bodies through Sound Therapy. Kalco Publishing: Landing, New Jersey, 2004. pg. 228. 266 Davis, Dorinne. Sound Bodies through Sound Therapy. Kalco Publishing: Landing, New Jersey, 2004. pg. 228. 167 wave interactions can support or stress individual body processes and organs. Ancient music systems varied as the time of day and season changed to provide balance to listeners as local energy varie d. It feels different in the morning than it does in the heat of an afternoon. It feels different in summer with the contributing sounds and the energy of plants, than it does in the winter. Ancient music was written to balance the human energetic system w ith incoming energies from space and nature. In contrast, f requencies of cell phones, microwaves, electricity, electromagnetic waves, polluted foods, polluted water, polluted air and unhealthy habits create stress in our personal frequency systems. Dr. Becker caution s, All abnormal, manmade electromagnetic fields, regardless of their frequencies, produce the same biological effects. These effects, which deviate from normal functions and are actually or potentially harmful, are the following: Increases in the rate of cancer -cell division Increase in incidence of certain cancers Developmental abnormalities in embryos Alterations in neurochemicals, resulting in behavior abnormalities such as suicide Alternation in biological cycles Stress in responses in exposed animals that, if prolonged, leads to declines in immune -system efficiency Alterations in learning abilities267 In summary, there are many variables in our environments that influence our internal frequencies. Some of these are: Sunlight Electrom agnetic energy from the sunspots Molten iron in the earth's core Weather Star light Level of vegetation Amounts of moisture in the air 267 Becke r, Robert, Dr. Cross Currents, The Perils of Electropollution, The Promise of Electromedicine , Penguin Group: New York, 1990, pgs. 214 -215. 168 Characteristic thoughts, feelings and attitudes of a population Intensity of electrical current, other energy source s and local industry Rhythm and pitch of the local language or dialect Pollution and environmental toxins Proximity of power plants, airports and places with excess energy , noise and manmade, abnormal electromagnetic energies Type of ground rock and soil c omposition History Local environmental color On a subtle level we interact with our environment to a greater degree than we ever imagined. Healing Frequency Patterns In India's ancient spiritual practice, a guru assigned a mantra to a devotee and aske d him to repeat it thousands of times. The mantra incorporated the energy that a devotee needed for harmony and balance. A mantra ( that Sharry suggests were mostly based on age categories) represented a devotee's ideal fundamental frequency . The mantra repetitions created a great deal of this needed energy for the devotee, becoming part of who he or she was. Today, we travel all over and are affected by energy in different locations, which have different resonating tones. This interaction alters our own frequencies. In addition, we meet a great variety of people who influence our signature frequency. The environment, traveling, mass media, people we meet and other factors influence our frequency needs. A complex web of internal and external acoustic signals interacts with our own unique frequencies. The ideal mantra in the twentieth century may change more often than it did in ancient times. The body craves pitches and rhythms that facilitate internal harmony. Since the environment affects our internal b ody frequencies, our frequency needs vary in different locations. This is why different music is appealing in contrasting locations. People are instinctively attracted to music that on some level provides a form of healing. Listening to music that you love improves your well -being. Sometimes I buy a new musical CD and enjoy it over and over again. 169 If I listen to it too much, I become saturated with its sound and then I am ready to list en to new music. My body absorbed what it needed and it is no longer dr awn to the music. On a subtle level, the music has changed me and I now desire something else. We assume we like a song because it is a personal preference. On a subconscious level music is a set of numbers. BioAcoustics suggests that these numbers enabl e the body to complete needed internal mathematical equations. Our body creates a sense of pleasure that correlates to the FEs that we need. Many agree that numerical patterns found in nature when converted to frequencies are beneficial to us. Leonardo D e Pisa, better known as Fibonacci, observed principles found in musical harmony were organized according to that of branching, flowering and spiraling patterns in nature. He observed the Fibonacci series, in which adding two adjacent numbers gives the next number in the series: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 and all the way to infinity. The ratio of neighboring Fibonacci numbers approaches phi (1.618) .268 These ratios are found in our bodies, the spiral of a seashell and in billions of stars in distant ga laxies. 268 Phi is the symbol for the golden ratio. The golden ratio has fascinated intellectuals for at least 2,400 years . Some of the greatest mathematical minds of all ages, from Pythagoras and Euclid in ancient Greece , through the medieval Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa and the Renaissance astronomer Johannes Kepler , to present -day scientific figures such as Oxford physicist Roger Penrose , have spent endless hour s over this simple ratio and its properties. The fascination with the Golden Ratio is not confined just to mathematicians. Biologists, artists, musicians, historians, architects, psychologists and mystics have pondered and debated the basis of its ubiquity and appeal. The Golden Ratio has inspired thinkers of all disciplines like no other number in the history of mathematics. Mario Livio , The Golden Ratio: The Story of Most Astonishing Number Luca Pacioli (1445 -1517) defines \"precious jewel:\" \"Geometry has tw o great treasures: one is the Theorem of Pythagoras , and the other the division of a line into extreme and mean ratio; the first we may compare to a measure of gold, the second we may name a precious jewel.\" Charles Bonnet (1720 -1793) points out that in the spiral phyllotaxis of plants going clockwise and counter -clockwise were frequently two successive Fibonacci seri es. Martin Ohm (1792 -1872) is believed to be the first to use the term golden section to describe this ratio, in 1835. E Edouard Lucas (1842 -1891 ) gives the numerical sequence now known a s the Fibonacci sequence its present name. Mark Barr (20th century) suggests the Gree k letter phi (), the initial letter of Greek sculptor Phidias's name, as a symbol for the golden ratio. 170 Major chords approximate the Fibonacci numbers 1, 3, 5 and 8 in a modified form. The next number in the Fibonacci series is 13. When the 8th and 13th tones are played together, they create the 8/13th interval. The 8/13th interval is believed by s ome to harmonize and thereby raise our consciousness269 and precipitate mankind's next evolutionary step. The Fibonacci ratios, if drawn, reveal a spiral, similar to the one found in a nautilus shell. In contrast, Western music creates a circle when drawn due to equal -temperament adjustments. Many ancient traditions believed that listening to the spiral pattern in sound enabled one to quicken his soul and rise closer to God. In contrast, the Western scale creates spiritual progress that can be likened t o a dog chasing its tail. The Fibonacci numbers found in nature can be converted into tones. My CD, Paint Your Soul, with my original musical compositions, uses the Fibonacci frequencies, including the 8/13 interval.270 One does not hear the exact Fibona cci frequencies in our music today, because the frequencies are in between the smallest intervals in the musical scale that we use. People do not receive the benefits of these precise tones. The Paint Your Soul CD creates the pure tones of this spiral pattern by using tuning forks designed to create the exact Fibonacci frequencies. The tones twinkle continuously in the background of this soothing and fluid music. Geometric Shapes Like most people, I believed that inanimate objects do not make sound s. Chairs , 2-D shapes and other objects appear silent to me. Roger Penrose (b.1931) discovered a symmetrical pattern that uses the golden ratio in periodic tilings , which led to new discoveries about quasicrystals . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio 269 Consciousness defies simple definition. It has been defined loosely as a constellation of mental attributes such as subjectivity, self -awareness, sentience, and the ability to perceive a relationship between oneself and one's environment. Consciousness may involve thoughts, sensations, perceptions, moods, emotions, dreams, a nd an awareness of self. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness 270 Sample this music at www.jillswingsoflight.com . Receive compleme ntary mp3's and sound healing newsletter at www.jillshealingmusic.com . 171 Only living things make sounds. Yet, water, fire and air can create sounds and they are not alive. I later heard sounds coming from things that I had previously believe d to be silent, like deep s pace; b ut now I marvel at NASA's recordings of space sounds. Sharry hears otoacoustic emissions streaming out of people's ears and th ese sounds can be recorded with sensitive devises. I never would have dreamed that tiny sounds streamed forth from our ears ! Sharry hears different sounds emanating out of the ground in various locations. Sharry also hears sounds emanating from shapes , even 2 -D shapes. She also hears sounds from photographs and handwriting. Sharry is not the only one insisting that sounds an d shapes are related. Masuro Emoto froze water while exposing it to music. He then photographed the water as it froze and published pictures of the resulting crystalline structure s. His images documented beautiful crystal shapes that formed when water was exposed to classical music, and distorted images that were created from heavy metal sounds. This showed that different sound vibrations, in close proximity to the freezing water, affected the tiny crystalline shapes within the frozen water. In this way, he correlated shapes with sounds.271 As was mentioned earlier, Hans Jenny, a Swiss physicist, put sand on a metal plate and attached a sound generator to the bottom of the plate. Certain sounds created recognizable 2-D shapes in the sand. He filmed many shape s being formed by sound vibrations, such as: Intricate geometric patterns Mandalas Flower patterns Biological forms Powerful archetypes Pictures that look like stained glass Patterns found in crop circles272 Jenny also associated sounds and specific shape s. 271 Emoto also theorized that the resulting shapes in the water might have reacted to underlying feelings that the water may have been expo sed to. Books by Masuro Emoto; The Hidden Messages in Water (by Masaru Emoto and David A. Thayne), Love Thyself: Message from Water III, Restore Your Well Being, Water Crystal Healing: Music and Images to Restore your Well -Being. 272 Mattson, Jill. Ancient Sounds Modern Healing, Wings of Light: Oil City, Pa, 2006. pg. 46. 172 Sharry is able to voice a sound similar to the whistle made from a crystal b owl. She gradually increases a frequency, until she hits one note that creates an echo. When this special pitch is sung t he room appears to sing. This frequency is amplified by the shape of the room. Sound reverberates off the walls and ref lects back so as to increase its volume. Sharry told me that a square room produces a frequency of a C. When singing in a square room a C will increase in volume so much that it appears to sing back to you. Other notes in a square room will not. In a parallel manner, the pitch of a D is emitted from a room that is nine by eight feet. The pattern given to me by Sharry is the following chart : Shapes and Sounds Pitch Natural Harmonic Scale Ratios Dimensions of the Room C 1 Square (1) D 9/8 18 x 16 E 5/4 10 x 8 F 4/3 8 x 6 G 3/2 6 x 4 A 5/3 10 x 6 B 15/8 30 x 16 In between B-C Circle The ratios used to create these exact notes are the same as pitches in the harmonic sca le (a just intonation scale) . This scale is based on the natural division of a vibrating string into seven harmonic parts. In ancient Egypt, healers wrote special symbols, letters and shapes on materials and submer sed them in water. The Egyptian stories tell tales of healing that occurred when the water was swallowed. The ancient Egyptians energized the water by exposure to shapes, glyph s and later, words -reportedly , affect ing the wellness of the person. 173 The ancient South Americans put flowers in water to imprint the vibration of the flower upon the water that they then drank. Water has been used to imprint information which can be incorporated into a person when he drinks it. Sharry noticed that the sounds coming from the geometric shape of the Malte se or Knights' Templar cross273 were familiar to her. The familiarity of the sounds attracted her to this design. She commonly uses these very tones in BioAcoustics! The Maltese cross replicated a common healing frequency combination. Sharry's healing freq uencies often utilize complementary tones or colors, which equate to the musical interval of a minor sixth. Sounds Sharry heard coming from the Templar cross were similar to musical intervals of three, six and nine notes apart. The 1 -3-5 triad, which is used in our current musical system, was not always the basic pattern for a chord. A 1-3-6 triad was brand ed The Devil's Triad in the Middle Ages. This chord included the interval of a minor sixth. Sharry frequently uses this interval to balance troubleso me voice spikes. The Catholic Church prohibited the healing interval of a minor sixth to be played, according to a book written by Penelope Gouk,274 preserving the healing secrets for themselves . (See Appendix B) Sharry had the unique childhood experience o f finding an object with three interloc king triangles, all sharing one side. She discovered that this shape produced a shadow of a Templar cross , as seen on the next page . 273 The Maltese cross has four V -shaped arms joined t ogether at their tips, so that each arm has two points. 274 Books by Penelope Gouk: Musical Healing in Cultural Cont exts, Enlightenment, and Representing Emotions: New Connections in the Histories of Art, Music and Me dicine . 174 Sharry's R endition of the Templar Cross The Templar Cross desi gn was found on ancient pottery dating from 6,000 BC in ancient Turkey.275 Throughout history this symbol was thought to represent many things, such as the four directions (north, south, east, west), the four elements (fire, air, water, earth), the symbolism of the immortality of the serpent (representing wisdom),276 and it has been associated with the goddess Venus (the feminine energy).277 Sharry had this geometric shape constructed in metal. From one angle the sculpture looks like a design of interwoven trian gles, from another it appears to be a series of X's making a square pattern. At a specific angle it gives off the shadow of the Maltese cross. Since Sharry hears sounds coming from shapes, she developed an appreciation of sacred geometry. Sacred geometry , an ancient belief system, teaches that certain geometrical and mathematical proportions are likewise found in music , light and cosmology . Sacred geometry professes that unique healing and spiritual properties radiate from special designs. Today, definitions of s acred geometry are broad, ranging from mathematical to esoteric in nature. Here is an esoteric definition of 275 http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/codex_morpheu/cross.html 276 The Geometry Behind the Maltese Cross http://sacredcirclecosmos.com 277 http://www.magdalenemysteries.com/venus_tem plars.html 175 sacred geometry: Sacred g eometry is a variety of grid systems organizing aspects of consciousness and the energy relationships that support the consciousness field.278 This definition relates the energy of certain shapes to levels of consciousness. Throughout antiquity, certain sh apes were believed to create powerful energy that could be used for targeted purposes. For example, the swastika symbol was used in antiquity to denote good luck. Archaeological evidence of swastika -shaped ornaments dates from the Neolithic period. It occurs mainly in the modern day culture of India , sometimes as a geometrical motif and sometimes as a religious symbol. It remains widely used in Eastern religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism . Though once commonly used, because of its iconic usage in Nazi Germany the symbol has become stigmatized in the Western w orld, even outlawed in Germany.279 Hitler was aware of the energy associated with this symbol. Sacred architecture refers to any building system that enhances spiritual awareness, effects and processes by incorporating select shapes in the building design. Sacred geometrical shapes, such as the Templar cross, are used in: Sacred architecture - temples , mosques , megaliths , monuments , sacred structures and churches Sacred spaces such as altars and tabernacl es Meeting places such as sacred groves , village greens and holy wells The creation of religious art, iconography , using divine proportions280 Colored Time Donna Eden developed energy medicine techniques and has taught over 50,000 people worldwide to understand the body as an energy system. Donna Eden, like Sharry Edwards, teaches that people have signature colors (a signature color is a higher octave of our fundamental frequency ). Donna, a clairvoyant, sees auras with her 278 http://sinclair.quarterman.org/sacredarchitecture.html 279 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika 280 Using the golden ratio, Fibonacci numbers or other numerical patterns found in nature. 176 naked eye, which she differentiates from signature colors. Signature colors stay with us for our lifetime, but aura colors change with our current emo tions, physical and mental conditions. She witnesses that aura colors change around people as they go through their life, but their signature color remains consistent. Donna describes the personalities and typical strengths and challenges associated with each signature color. Her descriptions of challenges and attributes associated with colors are similar to Sharry's descriptions on the Color, Tones and Signs on page 189 and also to typical astrological characterizations of people. Each color refle cts one's life lessons. In addition to echoing many concepts that Sharry embraces, Eden declares that the predominant color energy around people changes throughout time. Donna noticed that people born from about 1890 to the early 1930s predominantly radia ted the signature color of green, which enabled people to take risks and show their brilliance. They march to their own drummer. Their life experiences challenged them to be their own person. People with a green signature color had to struggle to overcome impatience and the desire to be right. Donna says the energy of green creates learning opportunities about prosperity. Within this time frame, the United States grew rapidly in prosperity and also experienced the opposite side of the prosperity coin, the G reat Depression. Donna saw most people's signature colors change to blue in the era of 1927 to 1960, particularly the women. Blue energy is nurturing. This was the age of welfare, Medicare and Social Security. Mothers who radiated the color blue often ha d many children. Many parents provided opportunities for their children that they never had. Spare the rod and spoil the child ceased to be good advice for parenting. For example, when a child came home with a bad report card, he was no longer whipped, b ut he received a tutor instead. There are lessons associated with blue energy. People who radiate blue energy let other people off the hook, as they are enablers. The Holocaust was made possible during this time period by the Germans' enabling of Hitler' s rise to power. People with blue signature colors are born optimists. They do not set structures and boundaries , but their life is enhanced if they learn to . They have difficulty letting go 177 of people and things they are attached to. People with this energ y need to stick to their guns and not do what other people want them to. Around 1960 the new generation primarily radiated the signature color of violet. This color correlates to the emotions of empowerment and spirituality. During this time policies of tyranny and oppression fell, the Berlin Wall was torn down and Eastern European countries gained their freedom. The hippies and flower children promoted peace, and the war in Vietnam came to an end. On the other hand, searching for an ideal such as peace b ecame disillusioning if one couldn't maintain internal peace. Many turned to altered states and drugs for this euphoric feeling. The difficult learning experiences of the violet energy are reflected in dealing with terrorism, which undermines empowerment a nd reflects world conflicts. People radiating this color are learning about power, within the world and within themselves. They have healthy egos; yet, they are searching for spiritual values. As time passes , the frequency of the new generation 's signatu re color changes allowing civilizations to learn new lessons. Ancient and esoteric mystery schools also profess that the energy of a color is predominantly active during designated time periods. This energy produces the emphasis reflected in the dominant a ctivities of the civilization. The people who live during this time have opportunities to grow when they learned the lessons of the predominant color energy. Ancient mystery schools281 describe thoughts, emotions, challenges, blessings and lessons associate d with colors. They describe lessons that people can experience and attributes that they can develop by focusin g on a specific color vibration . 281 A mystery school is a university for the soul, a school for the study of the mysteries of the inner nature of man and of surrounding nature. By understanding these mysteries, the student perceives his intimate relationship with divinity, and strives through self -discipline and devotion to become at one with hi s inner god. Theosociety.org. 178 Color Lessons and Attributes Violet Freedom, Ceremony, Mercy, Purity and Transmutation Green Truth, He aling, Abundance and Science White Purity, Discipline and Harmony Pink Love, Adoration, Creativity and Compassion Yellow Wisdom and Understanding Blue Power, Will, Protection and Faith The mystery schools also taught that great avatars d emon strated the lessons associated with the vibration of a color. Buddha taught the lessons of the green ray, while Jesus provided his life as an example of mastering the golden ray. Let's review what we have explored about colors! Colored lights have been effective in changing the chemistry within people's bodies. For example, blue light is applied to the skin to cause a chemical reaction in blood circulating under the skin, effectively lessening bilirubin levels282 in some types of neonatal jaundice. Donna Eden professes that people radiate colors that influence civilizations during certain time periods. Color s impact minute energies in our bodies, subtle interactions with others, and even global trends. 282 Bilirubin (formerly referred to as hematoidin ) is the yellow breakdown product of normal heme catabolism . Heme is found in hemoglobin , a principal component of red blood cells . Bilirubin is exc reted in bile and urine , and elevated levels may indicate certain diseases. It is responsible for the yellow color of bruises , urine, and the yellow discoloration in jaundice . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin 179 Waves affect us on tiny molecular and huge cos mic levels. Yet, the patterns of influence are similar. The wise philosopher of antiquity, Hermes Trismegistus, is quoted as saying, As below so above, as above so below. His meaning is that from the whole universe to tiny atoms, from a star in the sky t o a firefly, from the sun to the heat within a cell, there is an immense chain. The language of frequencies, expressed as colors, sounds and other types of energy, connects us all. If one records a voice and raises it up three octaves, the sound is remin iscent of crickets. If the recording is raised up five octaves, it mimics bird chirps. Taken up two octa ves further, it resembles whale sounds. Taken up even farther, these sounds become similar to the tones that are recorded from the stars. In some way, w e speak the same language, but on different octaves. We are truly in one uni - verse, meaning one verse or one voice . Chapter Ten Musical Astrology The German scientist, Fritz Albert Popp, uncovered mechanisms of cell communication. Popp sho wed in his experiments that weak light emissions were sufficient to orchestrate the body. The emissions had to be of low intensity, because these communications were occurring on a quantum level, and higher intensities would be felt only in the world at la rge.283 Weak light emissions from a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum are used in the body to facilitate internal communication. Dr. Becker284 describes an analog current system found within the central nervous system.285 This system , the perineural cel l system, 283 McTaggart, Lynne. The Field, The Quest f or the Secret Force of the Universe, Harper Collins Publisher: N.Y., 2002. pg. 47. 284 Dr. Robert Becker is a pioneering researcher in electricity and regeneration. He is an orthopedic surgeon and a professor at N.Y. State University, Upstate Medical Cente r and at the Louisiana Sate University Medical Center. He has authored The Body Electric and Cross Currents, The Perils of Electropollution, The Promise of Electromedicine . 285 Becker, Robert, Dr. Cross Currents, The Perils of Electropollution, The Promise of Electromedicine , Penguin Group: N.Y., 1990, pg. 62. 180 activated prior to nerve impulses, appears to make actual decisions and regulates one's level of consciousness.286 This analog system of body communication is powerful, indeed, if it controls consciousness. Both Becker and Popp agree that low -intensity energy has a significant effect on the human organism. The body picks up analog, low-intensity energy from the stars and sunspots. NASA releases recorded star sounds. John and Christian Byrd from the Motorola Corporation published cycles of frequenc ies from space.287 Many writings from antiquity describe the use of music to balance changing subtle energies from space. When we do not harmonize with the orchestra of planet -sounds, our bodies can become inefficient, or perhaps fall into a state of diseas e or dis -ease. Pythagoras believed that musical scales should be based on astrological energy, such as the vibrations created by planetary movements. He hypothesized that the mathematical proportions of musical intervals should predict the movement of t he planets in our solar system. Kepler confirmed that the ratios of the f arthest and close st point of the elliptical orbits of the planets create d whole number ratios, used in just i ntonation scales. Pythagoreans studied music to gain insights into the m athematical underpinnings of the physical world.288 Kitty Ferguson, who wrote, The Music of Pythagoras , tells us, The Pythagoreans used music to heal the body and to elevate the soul, yet they believed that earthly music was no more than a faint echo of the universal 'harmony of the spheres .' In ancient cosmology, the planetary spheres ascended from Earth to Heaven like the rungs of a ladder. Each sphere was said to correspond to a different note of a grand musical scale. The particular tones emitted by the planets depended upon the ratios of their respective orbits, just as the tone of a lyre -string depended upon its length . The music of the spheres was never a fixed system. Many variant schemes existed because each philosopher approached it ...from a differen t perspective.289 286 Becker, Robert, Dr. Cross Currents , The Perils of Electropollution, The Promise of Electromedicine , Penguin Group: N.Y., 1990, pg. 65. 287 BioAcoustics has incorporated these frequencies into its data banks. 288 Ferguson, Kitty. The Music of Pythagoras , Walker: N .Y. 2008. Pg. 130. 289 http://www.skyscript.co.uk/kepler.html#ch 181 The low levels o f electromagnetic energy change continually. In Chinese acupuncture theory, energy concentrates on a section of the body and then this intensity moves around the organs following a clock -like pattern, responding to environ mental energies that change throughout the day. For example, from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., the heart's energy is at its peak. At 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., the kidneys' energy flow is at its greatest. The best time to treat an organ is when the energy flow is the greatest. It has also been postulated that jet lag is caused by the interruption of this natural body clock. Dr. Gerber relates this cycle of biological energy to the cosmos. It is possible that some of our innate biological rhythms are reflection s of higher subtle energetic rhythms. The subtle energy rhythms are, in turn, in resonant synchrony with the cosmic cycles of the universe.290 Western medicine is exploring the timing of various treatments. The idea of optimal treatment relating to tim e of day is only recently explored in Western medicine. There is now significant evidence to support the concept of an internal clock. This internal timepiece, which governs many bodily functions including cyclic enzymatic activity within the brain, also s eems to have an effect on drug toxicity... Cancer researchers have discovered that drug therapy administered during early morning hours had the least toxic effects on experimental animals.291 Sharry points out that the energy recorded from space changes eve ry couple of hours during the day, creating changes within our own subtle energy as the day progresses. This may explain the conclusive research findings regarding the timing of cancer treatments. Astronomy anticipates energy from the moving planets, the sun and the moon. The movement of planets can be likened to a water boat that makes waves in its path. Astrology claims to predict future influenc es based on the electromagnetic energy created by waves resulting from the ongoing movements of the planets and these energy interactions as they transit through space. Astrology describes the influence of energy crea ted from these movements as their 290 Dr. Gerber, Richard. Vibrational Medicine, The Number One Handbook of Subtle -Energy Therapies, third edition, Bear & Co.: Ver mont, 2001. pg. 184. 291 Dr. Gerber, Richard. Vibrational Medicine, The Number One Handbook of Subtle -Energy Therapies, third edition, Bear & Co.: Vermont, 2001. pgs. 183 -184. 182 energies arrive on earth and interact with our subtle energy, influencing us emotionally, mentally and physically . Numerous traditions have understood astrological energy since the 3rd millennium BC . Astrology has played a role in the shaping of cultures, early astronomy , the Vedas , the Bible and various disciplines throughout history. Although today many people do not take astrology seriously, this was not the case in ancient history. In ancient times people practiced a form of musical astrology. In this healing art of the ancient Chinese and Hindu cultures, the leaders regulated the instruments and music heard during the year to balance people's finer energies. The music and the harmonics were altered to balance people's energy with the subtle energies coming from planetary movements. (Harmonics vary in volume from different instruments. By changing the instruments that you listen to, you change the intensity of harmonics that you hear. At certain times of the year, wood instruments, metal instruments, reed instrumen ts, or drums were exclusively played to keep people in balance with seasonal energy.) This was believed to have a harmonizing influence on the civilization. Ancient documents refer to the early Chinese systems of musically playing the stars . Historical documents describe leaders restricting their people's access to certain music to influence their emotional and mental responses, and in essence this provided a controlling factor over the people. This information was safeguarded to preserve these powerful secrets that could influence entire civilizations. Documents reveal that astrological signs were assigned specific frequencies. The tone system of ancient China, the Lu' scale, consisted of twelve notes obtained by successive fifths292 (each note was about five of our notes apart). Each of the twelve Lu were assigned a month or constellation of the zodiac... During a given month, it was only permitted to play music based on ...a scale stemming from the corresponding Lu.293 In the ancient cultures both the musical system and the calendar were intimately connected. 292 Naturally for the sake of practical music making they are transposed into a na rrower compass.

Cosmic Music: Musical Keys to th e Interpretation of the Universe , Inner Traditions: Vermont, 1989. pg. 185 183 In the 1600s scientist Johannes Kepler sought evidence for harmony in the universe, as described by Pythagoras and others. Kepler found that the movement of planets creates a scale that was linked to simple, whole numeric ratios.294 In his book, Hermonices Mundi, the Five Books on Musical Harmony, Kepler calculated the angles of the planets (as measured from the sun) from their extreme positions in elliptical orbits during a twenty -four-hour period. A system of simple intervals emerged, sixteen in all , which are musical consonances or intervals with whole number ratios (two of the intervals were not whole number ratios).295 He offers this as proof of harmonic laws in the cosmos. If we take Kepler's dia tonic musical scale296 and reduce it mathematically through octaves, these waves correspond to the brain wave patterns of alpha, beta, theta and delta. Think about that. The movements of the planets create frequencies and our brain waves emulate that wave pa ttern.297 Isn't that astounding? 298 Four hundred years later , a pair of Americans detected a form of music from the heavens. In 1993 Hulse and Taylor landed the Nobel Prize for discovering binary pulses - stars which send out electromagnetic waves in pulses . The most sensitive equipment located in one of the world's highest places, high on a mountain top in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, picks up evidence of their existence through radio waves.299 294 Godwin, Joscelyn.

Between each of the two half steps are either two or three whole steps, with the pattern repeating at the octave . The modern major and minor scales are diatonic. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_scale 297 Sylvia Francke said, The harmonics of the diatonic tempered musical scale, in frequencies below nor mal hearing range, correspond to brainwave, cluster patterns. Francke, Sylvia. The Tree of Life and the Holy Grail , Temple Lodge: England, 2007. pg. 200. 298Brain waves are measured as frequency and magnetic potential. When magnets are attracting, coming c lose together and increasing in kinetic energy, the magnets are decreasing in magnetic potential energy. The kinetic energy increases, because of The Law of Conversation of Energy, which states that energy can't be created or destroyed, only change forms . It's like ladling soup into a bowl. All the soup is still there, it just came out of the pot, and into the bowl. The pot is symbolic of one form of energy and the bowl of another. answers.yahoo.com electromagnetic energy 299 McTaggart, Lynne. The Field, T he Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, Harper Collins Publishers: N.Y., 2002. pg. 88. 184 Author David Tame reports , The sun itself has been described as a great musical instrument' by Dr. Martin Pomerantz of the Bartol Research Foundation... They have detected oscillations on the sun's surface which they bel ieve originate from acoustic vibratory waves inside the fiery sphere. Eighty tones or different kinds of vibrations have been observed, with periods of two to eight minutes. Tame continues, These oscillations, as well as radio waves of space have been transposed into audible sound. The results, though interesting, cannot really be said to correspond to mus ic as we know it. However, Saturn's magnetosphere produces waves which when transposed into sound, have been described as a slow dreamy melody. When Voyager 2 drew close to the ringed world it picked up the whines and hisses of the magnetosphere and beamed them back to earth.300 When speed ed up they consisted of a melody. The movement of planets creates low vibrations that affect our subtle energy. The earth also emits low levels of electromagnetic energy from the spinning core of molten iron way below the surface. Energies from the sun distort the earth's field with high -energy solar winds. The interaction of the earth's magnetic field (from the molten iron) and the solar winds (from the sun) morph s into electromagnetic energy, which is comprised of low f requencies.301 Dr. Becker describes cosmic magnetic influences on life. The strength of the Earth's magnetic field averages about half a gauss, and worse yet, its daily charge is less than 0.1 gauss. Compared to a magnet that holds a refrigerator door cl osed, this is peanuts, indeed. There is simply no way that such a small charge in could influence even a compass needle. However, Professor Brown's302 experiments in the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory indicate clearly that living organisms have the ability to somehow sense these minute daily cycles in the earth's magnetic field and to use them to time their biological cycles.303 300 Tame, David.

It has been proved that the subtle ener gy systems in our body detect and obtain information from geomagnetic fields. Similarly, astrologers profess that our subtle energy systems are influenced by electromagnetic energy that originates in space. Sounds of Planets, Sun and Galaxy German physi cist, Hans Cousto's life's work has been to apply his scientific training to unlock deeper links between the stars and frequencies. He believes there is a deep spiritual harmony in the design and flow of the universe. Music is an expression of this harmony . In his book The Cosmic Octave , The Origen of Harmony , Cousto shares his revelations: It was the result of a way of seeing things which moved me to combine the old teachings of harmonics with new findings in physics and other sciences. The result is an all- encompassing system of measurement with which it is possible to transpose the movements of the planets into audible rhythms, sounds and color. This basic system of measurement clearly demonstrates the harmonic relationship that exists between differen t kinds of natural phenomena in astronomy, meteorology and microbiology.305 Cousto explains his system of measurement, which, like the harmony of music, is inherent in the general structure of all beings.306 Cousto links the orbital and rotational motions of the stars and planets to specific frequencies for each celestial body. He then translates these celestial frequencies into audible pitches through the principal of octaves. 304 Becker, Robert.

Cousto's and Sharry's frequencies for these colors are reciprocals implying frequency differences perhaps resulti ng from different brain hemisphere usage. I have embedded both left and right brain formula of these star tones in the StarDust CD. A strong vibration, in close proximity, causes a lesser vibration to match itself. When we hear the sounds of the stars (raised up octaves into our hearing range) , we entrain the star tones. Just as we see the gorgeous starscape at night, the songs of the stars can twinkle inside of us. In addition to these planetary tones, I created tuning forks of the frequencies represen ting hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon...elements that make up our bodies and the same elements that are found in the stars. These tones also float in and out of the heavenly StarDust music. 309 BioSonics.com Planetary Tuners 310 Listen the music at www.jillswingsoflight.com .

Hope my story makes you feel like a little angel. Judy F When I listen to the Star Dust' CD, my air purifier turns off as the air is pure, and the air smells really wonderful. Scott K. I was taken by the haunting beauty of the vocals and by the cascading effect of the music. It seemed to create rhythmic surges of consciousness - as if my attention was being swept in and out like the waves on the ocean that were also a part of the music. Jeff C Your music represents one of my most intriguing encounters with music: It brought tears to my eyes at first, and weeks later, still leaves me in a state of contemplative quietude after listening. Judy S I find your music so hard to describe - so beautiful, just not of this world - too special to be earthly. Tillie S I am a channel, much like the late Edgar Casey, whose channeled information has been credited with establishing the us e of many herbal remedies. Through channeling experience, 311 I learned to identify great beings before they spoke, because I recognized their distinctive energy. In a similar example, if you close your eyes and pretend that your mother is sitting next to yo u, you can recall what she feels like. Her feeling is always characteristically the same. I 311 When one channels he alters his consciousness and allows a spirit to speak through him. 189 discovered that these distinctive feelings of specific beings could be captured during recording sessions. In silence I taped the presence of these divine bei ngs during channeling and I could later feel their presence in the recording. My music contains such channeled energies. Inside the cover of the Star Dust CD you find the names of the channeled beings for each song. Astrological Signs, Colors and Musi cal Notes Sharry has developed fascinating uses o f low level energies from space. Our bodies are hardwired to create a sense of pleasure when it sees or hears whole number ratios. Some just i ntonation scales use these ratios that follow the elliptical or bits of planets . Are these the seeming secret patterns of music that affect our consciousness? Sharry developed the following chart that shows relationships between colors, musical notes and astrological signs. There are twelve astrological signs that c orrespond to the twelve half -notes in our musical scale. Sharry also compares the energy of astrology to a color palette. Color, Tones and Signs Signature Color Fundamental frequency Astrological Sign Orange D Gemini Orange yellow D# (or Eb) Cancer Yellow E Leo Yellow green F Virgo Green F# (or Gb) Libra Green blue G Scorpion Blue G# (or Ab) Sagittarius Blue violet A Capricorn Violet A# (or Bb) Aquarius Violet red B Pieces Red C Aries Orange red C# Taurus Sharry correlates astrological e nergies and low level frequencies with the vibrations inside our bodies. The vibrations from the planets interact with and strike resonance with the frequencies within us. This interaction influences our personality traits and health attributes. Any 190 predom inance of a frequency creates characteristic health strengths and challenges, along with dominant personality traits. Our fundamental frequency , color, astrological sign and dominant emotional characteristics are harmonically and mathematically related. Sharry's principals of brain dominance, colors and frequencies apply to astrological energies as well. Sharry reflects that about 40 percent of the time a person's signature note matches his astrological sign. An additional 40 percent of the time this same person's voice reflects a missing note that is six notes away from the note of his astrological sign (or the complementary color). The remaining 20 percent of the time the pronounced and missing tones will vary with brain dominance . Sharry correlates thes e percentages to brain dominance. As we noted earlier, 40 percent of the general population is right brained. Forty percent is left brained. Twenty percent is whole brained. My astrological sign is Capricorn with a correlating fundamental frequency of A. Yet, when Sharry tested me with her freeware program nanoVoice, my fundamental frequency had moved to G # (the light reciprocal of A) . A fundamental frequency produces energy, which describes one's passions and influences. When a portion of one's missio n in life is accomplished, Sharry observed that the fundamental frequency is harmonized or balanced. Another tone may then become dominant as we embark on an additional life mission. Sharry hinted that if all of a person's tones are harmonized that it mayb e time for him to pass on or link to a group that supports one's higher mission. An altered fundamental frequency changes an individual's characteristic health and emotional patterns. For example, the note associated with an A, enabled me to be highly in tuitive, read between the lines and put myself aside for others. I was no longer radiating an A. Sharry described the personality traits associated with G #: wants to make a difference, likes to help and satisfy others, hands on, and time-conscious. (The color chart on page 108 has a brief personality description associated with each musical note.) Sharry informed me that the predominance of G# within my energy drives me to create useful physical products using words. Meanwhile, I was interviewing Sharry to write this book! Sharry suggested that the steps involved in 191 the writing of books would eventually balance the high volume of G# in my voice. Sharry also pointed out that I am attracted to people with a predominance of D in their voice, as this tone i s an interval of a minor sixth away from my predominate G# . The G# provides me with harmonizing balance. A fundamental frequency of G# attracts different people than an A. The G# will also create different coincidences than the fundamental frequency of A. As our fundamental frequency varies, so does our life path. These imbalances attract the lessons and adventures of our lives. Subtle frequencies recorded from space co rrespond to elements. Sharry suggest s that when the frequency -equivalent of zinc is received from space, people with colds get better quicker, as if they have taken zinc supplements. Sharry provides information to counter the negative energy on www.nutrasounds.com in her weekly Keynotes column. A sample of th is is on page 192. Astrolog y gets minimal respect today, but for thousands of years many highly evolved people, including the wise men from the Bible , used information about influences from the stars to make personal struggles triggered by subtle energy easier to navigate. Sharry's sound healing system creates tones to counter difficult geomagnetic, environmental, planetary and cosmic energies... which is not too dissimilar to the ancient Chinese's musical feng shui. Different frequencies coming from space interact with our physical bodies and emotions. At times these frequencies help us and at times they make our life more difficult. Let's say we already had too much G# in our voice and we receive even more of the frequency of G# from space. These waves combine and our imbalance is aggravated. When some people have failing health they usually report good days and bad days. These changing subtle energies from space can explain these experiences. Ancient wisdom acknowledges benefits from overcoming personal challenges. Likewise, a b ody builder exercises his muscles against resistance, such as weights. When we overcome negative emotional energy, we increase our emotional strength. As we overcome our negativity and obstacles our subtle energy becomes stronger. 192 Insights about the impa ct of astrological energies altered my perception of free will. Energies from the cosmos influence my emotions - without my conscious knowledge. What I am attracted to is established - without my conscious awareness. We have free will over our reactions to feelings, personality traits and coincidences. Yes, I have free will, but many of my feelings, personality traits, attractions, coincidences and opportunities are influenced by energies outside of my consciousness. This line of thinking gave me insights into sacred contracts. Carolyn Myss coined this term, which became popular from several Sharry's Key Note Frequency Report for March 17 -18-19, 2009 Time to pay attention to circulation issues - oxygen, blood viscosity, vein and capillary health... especially for those with cholesterol rooted issues. More discomfort associated with lower leg circulation may be noticed until the 20th. Supplementation with niacin, folic acid, choline, inositol and a decrease in fatty foods may be helpful. Bil, an enzyme/herb combinat ion by Theryzyme has been known to assist when the unfriendly fats in the body become troublesome. Because of the slowdown of circulation, people prone to gout may be more easily sent into an episode...especially when changes in the weather take them into dramatic temperature changes. This is often a thyroid issue. Conversion of chemical energy to muscle energy is stressed during these few days, but will open up into a surge of physical energy by the 21st when more mineral frequencies become available. You may feel a bit guilty because of your lazy spell but it is just Mother Earth expressing waves of energy flux. You will move along quite nicely beginning to build momentum around the 23rd. Magnesium may speed this interaction. Food containing magnesium i ncludes chocolate, brown rice and soybeans. Vulnerable muscles for this time are the wrist and psoas muscles. There is a vulnerability to Influenza on the 18th but may be offset by bioflavonoids. This is a time to get things on the table about expectatio n as you move forward into the fruition stage of what you have planned. It is much more important NOW that you lay the foundation of what is to be done in terms of who will be responsible for what factions of completion. Guilt will lie with what you said. Worry with what you have not done. We are within a few days of balance toward a new beginning. Take advantage of the next few days to complete the old so that you can start anew. You have until late on the 21st to finish -up any old business. 193 of her books.312 In short, a sacred contract is an agreement your soul makes before you are born, Myss explains. You promise to do certa in things for yourself, for others, and for divine purposes. Part of the contract requires that you discover what you are meant to do.313 The energy from the stars holds clues as to how we are directed to our life's work and sacred contracts. At the time o f our conception, astrological energies could be a deciding influence on the selection of our individual DNA, which produces our inherited personality. Theoretically, a spirit could choose the time of his conception, so that cosmic energies would impact DN A (life blueprint) to create a specific personality trait. Theoretically, a spirit could orchestrate important life relationships by coordinating conception times with planned partners, which would trigger attraction to designated people. I have read accou nts in antiquity in which marriage partners were determined by astrological compatibility, which is harmonious with such an idea. Subtle energy from the stars influences our health, emotions and interactions with other people. People in ancient times und erstood this and interpreted the significance of astrological influences. Some scientists are now discovering the ways stellar energy influences our lives. Sharry and others also interpret this influence and create tools to manage and understand this energ y. Conclusion In Part II we unveiled foundational concepts of BioAcoustic biology and related them to music, color, math, brain dominance, the environment and astrological energies. In Part III we will explore a myriad of ways to personally use this inf ormation for an enhanced life. 312 Myss, Carolyn. Sacred Contracts, Awakening your Divine Potential and Finding Your Sacred Contract . 313 Deco ding our Sacred Contract requires us to become fluent in the language of symbols and archetypes so that we can interpret dreams, understand the meaning behind coincidences,' and learn to follow our intuition. There are other authors who write about pre bi rth planning, such as Robert Schwartz in Your Soul's Plan: Discovering the Real Meaning of the Life You Planned Before You Were Born. 194 PART THREE APPLICATIONS Introduction to Applications Part Three describes options to harness benefits from sound . These methods are intrinsic healing modalities . This section is not a complete survey of sound healing app lications, but included are profound techniques that can be mastered with a reasonable level of commitment. Applications presente d here include Sharry's services , free p roducts and creative applications with roots originating in antiquity. Sharry's incre dible discoveries and applications birth hope for physical maladies and gives us tools to manage our emotions. Sharry spends a significant portion of her time to train people in the use of her system, releasing people from imbalances that define and dimini sh their lives. Chapter 1 reviews Sharry's services and educational opportunities. I view Sharry's nanoVoice as her most powerful free gift to people to date, so there is a dedicated chapter (Chapter 2 ) on this alone. This freeware program provides a better understanding of ourselves from the inside out. The nanoVoice can also be used to obtain deeper psychological and emotional underpinnings of the people that influence and interact with us. We listen to music a good portion of our lives, without any thought to its specific impact on our h ealth and emotional well -being. Music is a vibration that interfaces with and changes our internal vibrations. As we are exposed to music regularly it behooves us to carefully select beneficial music to listen to . Cha pter 3 explores information to help you select your listening choices. I included techniques of using your voice to make powerful life changes. I selected methods that mimic and expand on the sound healing techniques pioneered by Sharry. We can easily as sume that due to her special hearing, we cannot use sound as she does; however, we can do much along the lines of what Sharry does. 195 People in ancient civilizations understood the benefits of special sound s. In Chapter 4 we will discover toning, an ancient art to loosen stuck energy and provide vitalizing and needed frequencies . A revered prac tice in many ancient societies wa s listening to tiny sounds heard during silent repose. A meditative exercise described in Chapter 5 includes methods to hear subtle sounds - for significant personal benefit. Focusing on subtle and tiny sounds increases your consciousness of them. Since keys to our health, intellect and emotional well -being hide within the pitches of our voice, why not develop our speaking voice ? The final sound healing application s described in Chapter 6 demonstrate how to change our speaking voice for lasting and significant personal benefits . I have researched sound healing techniques from secret societies in antiquity for nearly twenty years , finding secrets hidden in hundreds of volumes. The texts contained inner teachings from secret societies like the Tibetan monks, Christian monks, Druids, ancient Egyptian priests, ancient Chinese and more. In ancient m ystery s chools the most powerful sound secrets were restricted to verbal communication and selectively given to the upper hierarchies of students. These secrets were only trusted to a few proven people. The reason was to prevent people from using sound to control and harm others . Each myst ery school allowed bits of information on the power of sound to be disclosed in writing. I read so many secret societies' doctrines that I cumulatively gathered sound healing techniques, amassing voluminous secrets to transform your world with sound. I continued my research by interviewing scientists and sound healers, confirming the effectiveness of many of life -changing techniques. My book, Ancient Sounds - Modern Healing, is a result of that research.314 This unique volume takes the reader on an extraord inary journey filled with secrets from age -old cultures, along with the latest findings from today's scientific community. Together, they reveal that sound can alter a person's brain waves, increase relaxation, 314 Available at www.jillswingsoflight.com 196 eliminate stress, aid the healing process and help us to become happier, healthier and more productive. I used the ancient techniques in my own musical compositions to rebirth these sonic gifts and the wonderful healing art that flourished eons ago. In addition to these techniques my CDs contain or iginal music. With the aid of clairaudient hearing I employed a form of cosmic plagiarism, copying the music I seemed to magically hear in my head. I met Sharry at a conference where we both were speakers. The depth of her discoveries attracted me l ike a magnet. It is easy to see how exciting Sharry's depth of o bservations and replicable results of using sound to empower our lives was tantalizing to me! I wanted to learn more as her information complemented what I had researched. Shortly after our encounte r I began writing this book. In summary Part Three describes how to perform magic with sounds to enhance our consciousness . With patient attention we can sense subtleties and nuances in sound, revealing people's intent ions, emotions and health. By lis tening to our own sounds we hear our body's symphony leading us to greater depth of understanding and peace within. More than ever before, we can understand sonic influences and use them constructively . This science of sound is just beginning to unfold . In time it will be universally accepted. Right now, it is as if sound can be used like a 197 magic wand to bestow ble ssings. May the magic of sound always uplift you! Chapter One Sound Health Services Sharry has numerous websites that provide education an d sound healing products. She offers her frequency gifts in a variety of forms. On her website you can learn how to create a voiceprint. After sending this to Sound Health you can acquire a report of pertinent information contained in your voice. For exa mple, you may want a report on the nutrition that your body needs right now, or perhaps which of your muscles are in danger of being hurt versus which ones would be improved by strength training. Perhaps you want to know if you are at risk for a vaccinatio n's side effects . A review of the various software packages listed in Part One of this book defines areas in which you can receive information. The cos t varies with the depth of services needed. The hourly rate varies between $40 and $125 at the time of th is writing. Many people take the next step and get a sound presentation (a sonic formula that is programmed into a tone box for you to listen to). Sharry has trained many qualified practitioners throughout the world that can analyze your voice and create a sound regiment for you. Their locations and contact information is available on her website . The software available from Sound Health contains a comprehensive set of sonic formulas collected from 30 years of experiences. Some people have taken pieces o f Sharry's methods and data to create other sound healing services. Some have developed helpful products, while other's services are shoddy and potentially harmful. Using a trained BioAcoustic practitioner that u ses Sound Health's latest software and datab ases helps avoid possible pitfalls ! If you want Sharry's expertise, you can schedule a session to sonically address your issues. Her fee is $125 per hour at the time of 198 this writing. Many sound presentations can be completed in about four hours over two days, depending on the circumstances. A follow up visit is essential! When a session is scheduled with Sharry, plan to spend two days in Athens, Ohio, or nearby. Your sound diet is tested in person: you must be present for this portion of service. On th e first day, several voiceprints are taken, while you discuss a variety of topics. The voiceprint s are analyzed and researched while you wait. Shortly after, you listen to test tones in the sound lab. The se tones sound like low frequencies pulsing in rhy thmic beats, as if someone is tapping a finger on a drum. You listen to tone trials in a separate room than the administrator , just as the x -ray technician leaves the room when you get an x -ray. One person's tones may not be beneficial to the next . While you listen to the tones, staff observes and measures your reactions with biofeedback equipment, such as a pulse oximeter or a temperature gauge. Different types of information are collected such as: heart rate, blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation lev els and body temperature. Your reactions are also analyzed, including whether or not you like the tones, body language, degree of relaxation, symptom changes, expression of emotions, tingling or tightening of muscles, fidgeting, dizziness, clenching teeth and comparisons of how you feel when the tones are turned off. A good rule of thumb is that if you like the sounds, they are beneficial. This information helps determine the length of listening time and selection of tones. More sound is not always better. Over listening corrects the problem and then produce s a new imbalance. Based on the results of tone test trials, sonic formulations are programmed into a sound box , referred to as a sound presentation. You can purchase the portable, reusable sound box (currently $4 50), or you may borrow one for a limited time under certain conditions . Listening times will be prescribed . Perhaps you can get started that day or night if you sleep alone. Listening duration is reduced over time as the body incorporates the FE s into its own sound matrix. Sound treatment can be required for several days to many mon ths, depending upon the severity, layers of the problem and chronic nature of the problem. 199 Your brain assimilates these sonic remedies into its maintenance regime. Wh en the body no longer needs the tones for support, you will begin to dislike the tones - that is the ultimate goal for the sound presentation. Periodic assessment is a critical aspect of sound healing. Sharry requires that you return to Sound Health to co mplete a second set of voice samples. Sharry observes the impact of your listening and reexamines a new voiceprint. Your tones and listening times will be refined, based on the results. The voiceprint delineates your chronic, current and predictive healt h issues. Most people schedule a session to target a specific health concern. However, important predictive information may be revealed. For example, Sharry described a woman who came in for chronic pain, which Sharry helped reduce during that session. Sha rry had observed that the woman was developing a far more serious disease. Shortly thereafter, the woman's regular physician diagnosed this condition for which she then scheduled an additional visit. Each person's matrix of sounds is unique. A BioAcousti c frequency formula that helps one person is not transferable to another. Sharry cited a case in which a girl used her twin's frequencies for a similar ailment, but her sister's frequencies made her sicker instead. One would think that the frequency formul a would be transferable , but our bodies are extremely complex. There are too many variables for one person's sound protocols to work on another. Improperly using BioAcoustics can create problems. Some frequencies can take your heart into rhythm and others take it out of rhythm. Sounds not properly combined with the right rhythms may prove ineffective. Sounds not accounting for brain dominance may also be problematic. BioAcoustics should not be used for many health issues, especially emergencies such as, b ut not limited to poisoning, traumatic bleeding, appendicitis and heart attack. Sharry has the following disclaimer on her website: Human BioAcoustics, as originated by Sharry Edwards, M.Ed., does not diagnose or prescribe for medical or psychological co nditions nor 200 does it claim to prevent, treat, mitigate or cure such conditions. Human BioAcoustic researchers do not provide diagnosis, care, treatment or rehabilitation of individuals, nor apply medical, mental health or human development principles. Neither the FDA nor the AMA considers BioAcoustics a medical technique. The primary emphasis is research. BioAcoustic Courses BioAcoustics courses315 teach how to analyze a voice and create a sonic presentation. This enables you to become a practitioner, researcher, and instructor to help your family, friends and yourself. The courses are available on line or on site, usually at Albany, Ohio. Learning how to regularly balance your unharmonious tones is an excellent way to remain healthy during this time of soaring health costs. Sharry wants people to understand how their bodies work (acoustically speaking). She presents us with this training opportunity so we can take a strong role in maintaining our health and harmony. There are numerous BioAcoustic cours es, internships, continuing education classes, forums and an annual conference to further develop professional level skills. Many become BioAcoustic practitioners after taking the five day Level Two course. Some people work in clinics or complementing medi cal or alternative health service , while others develop their own practice or business. BioAcoustic clinicians charge between $40 and $400 per hour for sound sessions. Physicians usually charge the higher rates. There are no standardized fee schedules for practitioners. At NutraSounds.com you can view contact information for practitioners with a good reputation. Practitioners in this network are required to submit case studies to Sound Health, enabling them to gauge the reliability of their work and to contribute to research efforts. Collective information is analyzed and additional databases are created from hundreds and hundreds of studies. Sharry is the hub of the BioAcoustic Internet. The research, ideas and discoveries of what 315 More information is available at www.nutrasounds.com . 201 works from all of the practitioners and researchers come into Sound Health . The staff and Sharry review the data. Being a BioAcoustic practitioner is not for everyone. It is a science in the making . Your observation, interpretation and good judgment are required to apply the principals. Voluminous amount of material s must be learned . The processes are not easy to understand at first, requiring patience and commitment. The Annual Conference An annual training session - where practitioners review research, new techniques, mar keting strategies , new product and databas es - is held once a year in Albany , Ohio. Some topics presented during the 2009 three -day event will give you a flavor for this annual training event : classes on cancer, hair regrowth, eye health, migraines, epilep sy, diabetes, the spine, iodine, frequencies for the new epidemic the swine flu, human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (HcG) diet, golf and sports nutrition, correcting chemical processes in the body, presentations on time -saving techniques, new products, t eaching and marketing ideas, new employment opportunities and legal updates. Practitioners share their finding s and contributions to the science of BioAcoustics. The Guardians of the People Network Sharry has established a network called Guardians of the People; Health for the People, by the People to support a grass roots effort to spread alternative wellness opportunities to your family, friends and clientele. Members of this group receive on line training and up to 12 computer programs to help co -create a community network for health and wellness. Trained members can educate others regarding nutrition, weight management, muscle trauma and on other health issues. The Guardian progr am has numerous agendas such as the use of sound health techniques to identify at risk people for vaccinations. Sharry's program, PreVac, can help evaluate the readiness of the body to appropriately process a v accine. This grass roots effort aims to spread the usage of this program so people can make informed decisions r egarding vaccinations. 202 Write SharryOnAir@gmail.com to receive more information and investigate GuardiansofthePeople.com. At the time of this writ ing, yearly membership is $9 5 with a monthly fee of $40 that includes the software program Abacus,316 and mont hly at least one software program, one clas s and newsletter . Other Information A wealth of i nformation on BioAcoustics is available. Some sources of information are : Nutrasounds.com (profiling and class of BioAcoustic Biology, which posts articles on this developing science) Videos on YouTube. Dozens of authors have written about Sharry in their books and information appears on many journals and sites. Chapter Two The nanoVoice Sharry gifts the world with her personality profiler software - the nanoVoice. It provides powerful information about our emotions that can make a critical difference in ou r lives. This information holds crucial keys for personal growth with the cumulative effect of positively impacting our society. The effect of emotions influences us more than we acknowledge. For example, the soaring cost of health care is a top priority in the world. 316 The Abacus program enables you to produce a frequency domain voiceprint and identify individual frequencies in your voice. 203 The root cause of many diseases lies in stressed emotions. In another example, war and famine have worldwide, devastating effects. If people maintained inner peace and harmony, would fewer people allow war? If most people displayed compassio n, could we reduce world famine? If people mastered their emotions to a greater extent, think of the incredible progress we could see in eradicating the problems listed above. The lack of emotional control is linked to crime, delinquency, domestic violenc e, sexual/physiological abuse, substance abuse and many other insidious problems. How many businesses falter from people whose egos are out of control? What is the cost of ignoring the healthy maturation of our emotions? The development of positive emotion s is crucial not only for the individual's development, but also for the well -being of our civilizations. One of life's biggest challenges is to discover our unique contributions in life and to pursue this path. To collectively face the unrivaled challen ges of the twenty -first century, more people must achieve this potential. Only in this way can the optimum future of humanity be realized. Our gifts are as unique as our fingerprints, but are not easily recognized nor developed. The secret to uncovering our life purpose lies within our feelings. It feels good to develop our natural talents. Pursuing what feels great provides an intuitive journey that can reveal our highest destiny. All people have experienced pain. In response many dull their feelings. When we harden ourselves to diminish pain we also disconnect with feelings that make us happy. The sh ell we construct to protect us also isolates us from joy. Numbing one emotion diminishes our overall ability to feel and be aware of what makes us happy. Fulfilling a personal calling is ultimately satisfying, provides unrivaled energy and cultivates joy. Yet, it gets even better. Experiencing positive emotions on a regular basis enhance s optimum health. Emotions drive our actions. Consider that determi nation, will, consistency, courage and fortitude fuel our successes , giving us 204 power. In contrast, negative emotions of depression and hopelessness rob us of life energy. The clich\u00e9 that strong people do not show emotions is the root cause that renders t hem powerless. Yet, we subconsciously block emotions out of our conscious mind. It's extraordinarily difficult to manage feelings that we are unaware of. I discovered first -hand the operating patterns of our subconscious mind by teaching people to play th e violin. Initially, learning to play violin demands more commitment than is required for other instruments such as guitar or piano. To play a single note a student must simultaneously control at least six skills. Violin students perform all skill areas si multaneously, but they consciously concentrate on only one. The skills , that the students are not paying attenti on to , go underground in their subconscious minds. For example, while a student concentrates on bow ing, he plays out of tune. There are defau lt settings for motor coordination that occur without our conscious awareness. Without our awareness, the brain averages the requirem ents for all motor actions. B eginning violinists play slow notes faster and fast notes slower. They average the length of t ime for both. The same is true for dynamics: beginners play all notes at the same volume, with no variation between loud and soft. Instinctively students place their fingers equidistant apart on the strings, as they play out of tune. This occurs without co nscious thought or awareness. Beginners stop bowing while they think about what finger to place down. They are not aware of the silence they create, altering the music's rhythm. The brain deems note recognition more important than timing. It stops one act ivity so the person can concentrate on what it deems most important. I have never met a student who is aware of these default processes. They just conclude that playing the violin is hard. Our mind, like a computer, operates programs in the background while we focus on one thing . Likewise, many subconscious emotions run in the background, affecting our health and behavior. When we get a virus on our computer, it insidiously and quietly works in the background, while we carry on...unaware. So it is in our li ves, as the impact of negative emotions can quietly cause us to crash, physically, 205 emotionally and behaviorally. In order to master these hidden emotions, we need to be aware of them. We experience complex thoughts, feelings and behaviors, but we are only fully conscious of one of these activities at a time. We subjugate feelings while we are preoccupied with other things. Our society minimizes emotions and encourages us to ignore them and act as if we are too strong for them to bother us. Paradoxically, pushing emotions into our subconscious mind makes it easier for us to be controlled , while strength quietly slips away. Underground emotional energy influences our health and creates emotional habits. It is not only unpleasant feelings that we wish to deny that find their way into our subconscious minds, but also routine thoughts and feelings that we experience all day long. We spend our formative years in school, developing our rational minds, but our emotion al development receives little formal attentio n. High divorce rates, job loss, employment stress, accidents, deaths, personal struggles, changing hormones, financial problems and health issues challenge everyone's emotional health. Yet, as a society we stubbornly treat the development of our emotions as a low priority. Perhaps since emotions are invisible , we falsely believe they don't exist. Meanwhile, emotions continually affect the bottom line of our health, happiness and well -being. The nanoVoice is a valuable tool to help us see what is going on in the underground playground of our subconscious feelings and thoughts. The ability to master emotions is contingent on our awareness of them. We do not eliminate negative feelings by ignoring them. Only after we identify and address them , are we able to release them. The nanoVoice paints our conscious and unconscious feelings in concrete numeric form. Below are examples in which knowledge of our subconscious feelings can spur our growth. People unknowingly project their subliminal feelings onto oth ers. For example, a habitual liar is quick to perceive that another is lying, and an angry man easily finds another who picks a fight. A person withdraws, not allowing anyone to get close, while he perceives that others have abandoned him. We miss the 206 conn ection when our own feelings (our own frequencies) wind up in our perceptions of others. We clothe dark fe elings in an acceptable light. For example, anger is often disguised as a righteous reaction. Subconscious expectations set up interpersonal booby traps. We do not voice our expectations, yet are disappointed when they are not met. It's easier to avoid misunderst andings and disappoint ments when we acknowledge our expectations. Our unconscious feelings can trigger other people's behavior. For examp le, Bob believes that he is no good and radiates this feeling. Those nearby feel this energy, subconsciously pick up on it and act accordingly. Subtly , Bob conditioned others to treat him with low regard. A person is rarely aware that his ego directs a situation , although this happens often . When we are not conscious of it, our ego is extraordinarily hard to manage. It is difficult to know ourselves from the inside out. Just like second -hand smoke inflicts damage on those nearby , so do our toxic emoti ons. Yet we steadfastly believe that we can hide our feelings without any impact on others. Sharry 's nanoVoice illuminates subtle emotions so we can better navigate emotional challenges. How to Use the nanoVoice The nanoVoice is a scaled -down vers ion of software called nVoice. NanoVoice is a free download available at www.nanoVoice.org. Instructions and free nanoVoice classes are offered online. The nanoVoice creates a graphic document after you speak into a microphone connected to your computer. The resulting time domain voiceprint shows component pitches found in our musical scale that are counted and compiled into bar graph s. 207 A specific emotion, such as love or anger, always feels the same because it carries a unique, invariant universal energy or frequency. When a person experie nces a specific emotion, it registers as the same frequency on a voiceprint. In the nanoVoice print each musical note in a scale is associated with specific emotions. For example, a tall bar gr aph representing the pitch of C indicates excess power, independence, ego, self -direction, excitement and physical motivat ion. Even though these feelings may be subconscious, they are revealed in the resulting voiceprint. There is mor e in your voice than you realize. The chart on page 108 shows which emotions are linked to each pitch in your voice. Emotions are linked to various organs and systems in the body by octave resonance. The nanoVoice also displays which body organs and processes are stressed. The nanoVoice program provides four to five paragraphs assessing your personality data. The full version of the software, the nVoice, creates a four to five page assessment. Both explain the pitches and colors that were created by your voice sample and how they relate to your emotions and health. Purposes of the nanoVoice Personality programs such as the nanoVoice have a multitude of applications. They identify our natural talents, strengths and capabilities, encouraging us to better utilize them. Simultaneously personality pr ofilers id entify our weaknesses, enabling us to convert them into strengths. Psychologist Carol Ritberger comments on our subconscious emotions: We are to the world a physical and a personality presence. We learn to deal with our physical presence from the day we are born, but our personality presence impacts us to a greater extent, and frequently we are oblivious to that impact.317 Sages throughout history report how difficult it is to know thyself, but these wise sages did not have access to the nanoVoice. Spec ial pitches reveal subconscious expecta tions, difficulty with openness or 317 Ritberger, Carol, PHD. What Color is your Personality? Hay House : Carlsbad, CA., 2000 . pg. 37. 208 desires to make a difference. The recording reveals areas in which we are emotionally stuck . Viewing our underly ing fear depicts our confusion, shed s light on indecision and depict s ego issues. Accessing buried feelings gives us profound insights to acknowledge, resolve and release negative emotional habits. Voiceprints taken throughout the day vary , reflect our natural changing emotional states. Different information emerges when we discuss various topics. Cumulative data from many discussions depicts overall emotional patterns. We can observe how often an emotional problem is present on a variety of issues. For example, anger may show up in ten of ten voiceprints or only one of ten voiceprints. The FE s of r epeated negative feelings accumulates , creating physical as well as emotional problems . When conflicting information surfaces in a voiceprint, the same conflict exists in our emotions. When we weigh the pros and cons of a decisi on, each emotion associated with an option registers in the voiceprint. The predominant strength of each emotion is reflected in the number of hits of each pitch (height of the associated bar on the bar graph), showing the intensity of that emotion. Sharr y records speeches of political candidates, world leaders and celebrities, giving us illuminating information about them . For example, a voiceprint report from Princess Dianna is included in the nanoVoice download packet. Sharry occasionally reviews voicep rints of political candidates and people in the news on her weekly radio show. The nanoVoice is useful for group dynamics, work disputes and family/marriage/relationship counseling. It provides foundational information to plan strategies in negotiations and to anticipate people's actions and reactions. The nanoVoice create s an objective review of people . Understanding how people are hard -wired makes it easier to accept that differences are just that - differences - nothing more. The nanoVoice can explai n our attractions and aversions to people. We will be drawn to a person who radiates the missing frequencies in our voice. If we have too much of a frequency and we meet another person with an abundance of this same frequency, we will be repelled. 209 Ever won der why opposites attract? It's well worth the time to use voiceprin ts to understand our subconscious sonic interplay. Our brain hemisphere usage affects our attraction and repulsion of other people. In Part Two we discussed that the right and left hemisp heres of our brain process frequencies in an inverse manner. For example, we can be attracted to someone when we are using our right brain hemisphere and repulsed when we are utilizing our left brain hemisphere , even if it is the same person . The nanoVoi ce voiceprint reflects which brain hemisphere a person is using. Red and yellow bar graphs reflect left brain usage, while green and blue colored bar graphs mirror right brain usage. Another way to note brain dominance is that people using their right brai n hemisphere create tones on the right half of a nanoVoice graph. Conversely, frequencies on the left half of the graph reflect the usage of the left brain hemisphere. Here is an interesting application of using frequencies to manage our attractions. To get over the death of a loved one or the loss of a lover, listen to the fundamental frequency of the missing person , which eases the heartache. If you do not know the lost person's fundamental frequency , listen to the tone associated with this person's astr ological sign. If you enjoy the sound of the tone, listening would help you to let go. If the astrological sign doesn't work, try using the reciprocal or light reciprocal frequency (see Part Two). Valerie Hunt, Ph.D., measures electromagnetic energy in pe ople's energy fields. She reports that some people can overpower others and sap their energy. In some relationships two people 's energy fields blend, each becoming stronger.318 The Nanovoice is a handy tool to predict results of energy interactions. For exa mple, a person with a predominance of C energy is learning to control his ego. Another individual, who radiates G# energy, tends to see himself as not physically important. When in a relationship , the C personality needs to learn not to overpower the G# personality which must develop boundaries and self -esteem. 318 Trivieri, Larry, Jr. Health on the Edge, Penguin Books: New York, 2003. pg. 196. 210 Leaders in psychology attest that our personalities affect more than just relationships, they affect our health as well.319 Carol Ritberger, PhD, reports, Current research in the areas of behaviora l medicine and psycho -neuro -immunology (the study of how emotions affect the immune system) reveals a direct correlation between personality and illness.320 Ritberger continues, As a matter of fact there are very predictable personality characteristics tha t can predispose a person to hypertension, heart disease, asthma, cancer, allergies, auto -immune disorders and many other related illnesses.321 Science confirms what we know from our personal experiences: improving emotional problems enhances our health. The nanoVoice can be used to support your health. Taking a voiceprint before and after consuming a medication will show its immediate impact. Does the medicine balance and harmonize tones? We can also note the impact of certain foods through voiceprints . If our body needs the food, our voice coherence should improve . (Increased v oice coherence is shown when each bar graph is similar in size.) Imbalance in our voice reveals that our body does not want or cannot use the nourishment offered. After we d iscuss o r touch a foo d that we may have an allergy to the resulting voiceprint may reflect a significant decrease in balance . If our voiceprint is missing a frequency, we can sing or listen to the absent or weak tone. We can harmonize ourselves on many levels by s imply singing our weak or missing notes. A follow up voiceprint will display the impact of our sonic remedy. Sharry relayed a story about discover ing predictive behavior wi thin the voiceprint. While conduct ing a role -playing exercise in a class on percep tions, she divided students into two groups. One group told the truth and the other team intentionally lied. Without knowing w ho was in each group, Sharry could readily hear the truth -tellers. T his piqued her curiosity . She reviewed everyone's voiceprint s, noting the balanced presence of A# and E pitches when the student spoke truthfully and the absence or an imbalance of these pitches when one lied. For example, in a 45 -second voice recording a person hits each note an average of 42 times. If A# recorde d 80 times and E showed 319 Ritberger, Carol, PHD. What Color is your Personality? Hay House: Carlsbad, CA., 2000. pg. 9. 320 Ritberger, Carol, PHD. What Color is you r Personality? Hay House: Carlsbad, CA., 2000. pg. 9. 321 Ritberger, Carol, PHD. What Color is your Personality? Hay House: Carlsbad, CA., 2000. pg. 10. 211 up 20 times, they would not be in balance. This person was not telling the truth. After further experimentation, Sharry realized that the A# and E pitches are absent in situations other than lying, such as avoiding uncomfortable f eelings or discussing a fearful or uncertain topic . The absence or imbalance of A # and E are linked to a state of denial - and we may not be aware of this . Here is an example of how we can use this information . Nicki was considering an important life cha nge - returning to college. After discussing this, her voiceprint showed no E and A# pitches, reflecting her indecision. Without understanding why, she may have procrastinated and neve r pursued this goal. Nicki realized that if she was serious about return ing to college, she needed to delve deeper into her feelings . This reflection brought to the surface her worry about driving her kids to school and getting to her classes on time, because of the distances in volved. To resolve the conflict Nicki moved to be closer to both school s. After she move d the balanced A# and E pitches appear ed in Nicki's voiceprint. The Personality Colors Our personality is like our automatic pilot, habitually processing information, making consistent decisions and creating our emotional climate. Our personality is made up of both traits and characteristics. Our traits are our hard-wired, emotional responses. Ritberger details, Traits are genetic coding that determines the way our brain develops and functions around mental pro cesses, which is how we gather and process information and make decisions.322 Traits develop our strengths and weaknesses, dictate how we perceive things and predispose us to certain attitudes, values, beliefs and motivations. Traits also shape what irritat es us, direct how stress affect s us, influence our self -esteem and shape our coping mechanisms. Characteristics, in contrast, are behaviors that we have learned from life experiences. Each color ed bar on the nanoVoice print relates to specific personality traits and weaknesses. As we saw earlier, doubling a given frequency creates octaves. This multiplying effect can be 322 Ritberger, Carol, PHD. What Color is your Personality? Hay House: Carlsbad, CA., 2000. pg. 7. 212 repeated many times to form octaves of much higher frequencies. FEs of emotions can be doubled by octaves until they are in the range of wavelengths of color. In this way Sharry correlated colors with personality traits . She also drew upon her research and experie nces from college studies that matched colors with personalities. The classification of personality trait by color is a non -threatening, reflective means to analyze people. The hues within a given color represent a personality trait or type (for example, blue, blue -green and blue-yellow are all hues of blue) . Sharry points out that our language verifies links between colors and emotions. For example, He was green with envy. She was so angry she saw red. Her sadness ma de her blue. At the time of this publication, even the Internet's Wikipedia reports that the color of money is equivalent to the pitch of an F or F#, which cor relates to the color of green. Effects of color are very real. Dr. Max Luscher323 believed that colors have an emotional value and that a person's reaction to color reveals his basic personality traits. His research provided conclusive evidence that colors create the same psychological, emotional and physiological reaction in people .324 The nanoVoice program depicts frequency bar graphs in one of four colors. Each color reflects our habitual method of responding to the world around us...our core personality tr aits. Red - A person with red personality traits engages in reactive behavior, gut -level reactions and rapid -fire thinking and actions. A person with red traits has a desire to act - before extensive planning and examination of his words and actions. Peo ple who see most of their pitches graphed in red are flexible when happy and immutable when wronged or hurt . These people like to be 323 Dr. Max L\u00fbscher developed a famous color test during the early 1900s. He has devoted his life to the study of how color affects behavior. The test is based upon fundamentals in color psychology. With years of research by color psychologists the characteristic s of certain colors has been identified to cause an emotional response in people. He studied the response from hundreds of thousands of test subjects around the world in order to isolate how certain colors make us feel. By doing the reverse, using the colo rs people prefer to determine how people feel, we can get some interesting indicators about a person's current emotional state. 324 Ritberger, Carol, PHD. What Color is your Personality? Hay House: Carlsbad, CA., 2000. pg. 44. 213 in relationships that they are in control of and know everything that is going on. They don't want to be told what to do or think. They pe rceive their desire to control i s their way of helping others. These people are physical and assertive , especially if pushed . Their mental processing is sequential. People with red traits tend to think of what is wrong and not what is righ t. They are hard workers, detail oriented and structured.325 These people like to see and do things before the rest of the crowd. They like to do things for the community. Sharry classifies the red personality as a fireman 's mentality. Green - People with green personality traits live in a world of hopes and dreams for the future . They believe that intangible things are vital in life. With rich imaginations, they are creative and their minds work quickly. People with these traits, see a bird's -eye view of situations. They primarily think with the left hemisphere of their brains. They also get caught up in their visions and intuitions, and can distort their perceptions to fit their dreams. With their highly developed intuition they read between the lines of what others say. People with green traits stand back while carefully select ing and planning their words and actions . They are slow to react without good reason. These people are driven by a need to be liked, often attracting co -dependent or abusive relatio nships. They avoid conflict and use their intuition to steer clear of it. Green personality types are champions of the downtrodden, the environment and human rights. A green personality type pushes himself physically. People with green traits have an inten se desire to make their lives count.326 Sharry summarizes these people as representing a farmer 's mentality . Yellow - Yellow personalities are self -reliant, self -made, self - respected, self -motivated, self -starting, and self -fulfilled. They like things their way and their lives center on their goals. Yellow personality types believe that they can do anything if they put their mind to it. They are challengers and natural leaders. They are original thinkers who dare to do things differently. People with yellow traits use their intelligence and develop many competencies. They think, plan and organize their words and 325 Ritberger, Carol, PHD. What Color is your Personality? Hay House: Carlsbad, CA., 2000. pgs. 71 - 85. 326 Ritberger, Carol, PHD. What Color is your Personality? Hay House: Carlsbad, CA., 2000. pgs. 119 - 133. 214 actions in a logical fashion. Their drive for perfection creates a critical and authoritarian streak, while they can be impractical, condescending a nd overly conceptual. They do not need critics, because they already judge themselves and rarely see a need for improvement . They can always spin an explanation to justify their actions. People with yellow traits have sharp mental processing, an intellec tual outlook and a logical and cautious approach to life.327 These people can be sensitive i f comfortable with their own liv es, but demanding and whining if they are not secure. Sharry feels that these people have a lawyer 's mentality . Blue - These people a re caretakers and put others' needs before their own. These people are loving, sensitive and concerned about other's needs. They do not have to be in charge , but are often put in charge because of their high level of empathy. When their emotions are not u nder control , questioned or abused, they can experience addictive disorders. The negative side of blue is being temperamental and fly ing off the handle at little things. These people need to know they are appreciated. They manage spiritual resources well , but they tend to give things away . They are skilled at communicating and have an overall love for humanity. They have an ability to put others first with a spiritual or emotional outlook (possibly a naive perspective). Sharry sums this category of people as spiritual leaders . The bar s representing frequencies in our nanoV oice print are colored. The colors change with the content of our discussions, because we apply different emotions and mental processes in various situations. The colors indicate which me thod of processing information we are using and how we will react to situations regarding that topic. We can apply interpretations of the characteristics of colors to various topics. For example, if we talk about sex, yellow bars in the graph reveal a pe rson whose physical sex includes heavy mental overtones. In contrast, the person's whose nanoVoice print depicts red bars display s spontaneous sexual activity and responses . The color blue appears when a person adds emotions to their physical expressions, while the color green reflects a person who is interested in long -term commitment and planning for the relationship. 327 Ritberger, Carol, PHD. What Color is your Personality? Hay House: Carlsbad , CA., 2000. pgs. 103 - 117. 215 Each bar graph also represents a musical note. The chart on page 108 describes the personality traits associated with each note. We can match the characteristics of a musical pitch and color. For example, a voiceprint shows a high , red bar graph of the note C. The musical note C indicates self -power, ego, self -direction, leadership, excitement and physical motivation. The color red reflects a reactive personality. When we combine the influence of the color red and the note of C, we can predict that this person will use their ego or strength to get their way without much thought to the outcome. They will act immediately on establishing what th ey think is right. If the same high C is green, we can combine the characteristics of the musical note and the qualities associated with green. This person sees the big picture , using experience and intuition to manage and accomplish things. They have th e necessary qualifications, but avoid management conflicts. With their intense desire to make a difference they can be workaholics, perhaps with little regard for the time commitments of others. If the extremely high C is yellow, the person may believe th ey should get their way, as they are most qualified to know what is best. They are initiators and organizers, but tend to believe that they know what is best for everyone, disregarding others' opinions. If the very high C is blue, this person is likely to be an emotional leader who champions a cause to benefit others. Their approach will be more charismatic than rational. Multiple colors can be revealed on the voiceprint , reveal ing a person's multifaceted outlook and approach to that topic . Although we all experience the entire gamut of emotions, when we have feelings outside of our core personality for an extended time we feel stressed. Emotions push us into doing what is beyond our normal habits . Challenging times force us to be flexible, which can improve our personality characteristics, or cause emotional and psychological problems. When our vibratory spectrum lacks certain frequencies we are attracted to people, places and things radiating the needed frequency, whether or not it is a positive or n egative experience . We manifest that which we most need to experience and master . Once a lesson is 216 learned, the new equilibrium state no longer invites those types of experiences/lessons. Spiritual growth is the never -ending expansion of one's energy to encompass deeper and wider aspects of all energetic mastery, to increase the vibrancy and strength of one's being. This involves enriching and expanding one's vibratory spectrum. The richer the spectrum, the closer it moves toward white light, containing al l colors, encompassing greater consciousness. In summary, the voiceprint can be used as a reflective tool to understand ourselves; it can reveal how we process information and emotions in a variety of situations as well as reveal this information about ot hers' behavior. The nanoVoice makes us more aware of: Subconscious feelings - relating to specific topics Our methods of processing information (such as the way a \"blue\" person would respond to a situation versus a \"red\" person) Our habitual reactions to people and events Understanding other people on a deeper level Areas of uncertainty (the absence of the notes A# and E in our voiceprint give us clues about underlying reservations and fears.) Hemisphere of the brain we are utilizing most Chapter Thre e Emotionally Healing Music Categorizing music as entertainment or a mood setter is a recent development, since the Renaissance period. This is a significant aspect of music. Music subtly massages emotions , or motivates us to dance, march or relax. An ef fective movie soundtrack enhances the drama and draws in the viewer. A movie would be greatly diminished without it. Music amplifies t he actors' and observers' emotions. 217 Convention al music contains FEs and rhythmic patterns , as does BioAcoustic software. Beyond the widely accepted notion that music affects our emotions is the unacknowledged power of frequencies to shape our health and thinking. Scientists have mathematical models of how rhythm can result in improved motor function.328 Rhythm excites, moves and gives order to our feelings, thoughts and sense of movement.329 Music improves speech , language and cognitive rehabilitation.330 The work of G. E. Mue ller and Schuman (1894, but confirmed by recent scientists) says that, The metrical organization (of m usic) makes it easier to remember verbal material.331 Thaut discusses even more benefits. Rhythm may also be one of the central processors to optimize our gestalt formulation in the basic process of learning and perception.332 Just as we ingest medicine a nd supplements for specific physiological benefits, music can be tailored for specific benefits. Music already does this, we are just not conscious of its impact. Emotions, musical notes and physical matter are energies that influence each other through r esonance. We blindly expose ourselves to FEs that impact our healthy thoughts and emotions. Levitin details m any physical benefits fro m simply listening to good music. Immunoglob ulin A (IgA) is an important antibody that is needed for fighting colds, fl us, and other infections of the mucous system. Several recent studies show that IgA levels increased following music therapy. In another study, levels of melatonin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine increased during a four - week course of music therapy, and t hen returned to pretherapy levels after the music therapy ended. Sero tonin (a naturally occurring hormone in the brain) helps to regulate the body's natural sleep/waking cycle and is effective in treating seasonal affective disorder. It is also putatively linked to the body's immune system because some researchers believe that it increases cytokine production which in turn signals T -cells to travel to the sites of the 328 Thaut, Michael.

Both norepinephrine and epinephrine affect alertness and arousal and activate r eward ce nters in the brain. All this fro m a song.333 Many ancient civilizations, such as the ancient Chinese, believed that those who controlled the music controlled the population. They guarded their musical concoctions as a security measure and policed the music of their provinces. Even as late as the Middle A ges the Catholic Church proclaimed musical do's and don'ts and restricted chord s and scales . In recorded history individuals first dictated musical selections during the Renaissance . Musicians co uld make a living from public performances. Classical composers create d eloquent, emotional and artistic pieces of music. The power of their compositions is evident by the ir enduring popularity. Research has shown that classical music produces a wide array of benefits. Here are a few examples : Listening to Mozart helped patients perform better in sight tests.334 Reports document a winemaker exposed his grape plants to classical music, resulting in better wines.335 Music, particularly Mozart, showed a therape utic effect on epilepsy .336 A popular study showed that students, who listened to Mozart prior to tests, scored higher marks in intelligence, as published in Nature Magazine in 1993.337 Research is accumulating evidence , documenting a multitude of benefits pr oduced by music. Certain music raises attentiveness, focus and concentration. You can feel in charge with confident sounding music and transfer this feeling, temporarily at least, to life.

Stimulating linguistic rhymes, dances, intricate movements and play in the early years are essential to developing and uniting the emotions, mind and body. Sound affect s us with a myriad o f powerful influences. Music holds a bountiful array of FEs with potentially broad effects on our physical, biochemical and emotional selves. We unknowingly immerse ourselves in this energy -altering wave stream without any thought to its impact. Wise peopl e will conside r what kind of music they listen to. Music can aid us in targeted areas. Perhaps music of the future will be consciously composed to: Transform negative emotions into positive ones Stimulate emotional sensitivity Enable people to feel emo tions that benefit mankind, such as forgiveness, gratitude or compassion Encourage heroic acts Open our hearts Enhance and integrate health Vibrate and invigorate our cells Create healthy subtle energies Develop targeted concrete and subtle energies Clarify and sharpen our minds Increase awareness In our modern day, Sharry worked with James Marshall, who wrote a song ,338 named , Le Ciel, with the frequencies that neutralize the swine flu. I share Sharry's deep desire to diminish negative emotions, whil e reinforcing positive ones. I do this with music. A girlfriend introduced me to the flower essences. I was thrilled when the flower essences provided inspiration for emotionally healing music. Some indigenous tribes of South America used flower essen ces to enhance their health and emotional states. They believe d that the energy of a flower is a gift to mankind through which a person can 338 http://shop.babynaynay.com/product.sc?productId=3 220 receive a specific emotional healing energy. One can feel the cheerfulness of a daisy or the beauty of a rose; each flower possesses unique energy. Applied properly, the essence of a flower can be transferred to an individual. Indigenous tribes devised an ancient process to capture the essence or energy of a flower. The y soaked the flower in purified water during early morning sunlight. The water imprinted the flower's essence.339 People drink t he captured water , taking in the flower's signature energy. A person ingests the flower essence to receive a desirable emotion that the f lower emulates. For example a fearful person drinks rockrose flower water to uplift his fearful e nergy and to transform it into trust. A man named Gurdudas describes the flower as the highest concentration of life force in the plant , representing the crowning energy of the plant. The actual flow er essence is an etheric imprint, or as he said, the intelligence of the flower. Dr. Richard Gerber reflects on the flower essences in his book, Vibrational Medicine . The flower essences utilize the energetic storage properties of water to transfer a frequency -specific, information bearing quantum of subtle energy to the patient in order to effect healing at various levels of human functioning.340 He continued, Flower remedies are used primarily to balance the mental and emotional energies of the indivi dual which, if unbalanced, will predispose to, as well as exacerbate, the various physical manifestations of illness.341 339 Dr. Jacques Benveniste is a medical doctor who discovered scientific properties of water, which defy explanation by the tenets of mainstream physics. His science, Digital Biology, is based upon two breakthrough observations that he can prove in experiments that have been duplicated by other scientists: 1. If a substance is diluted in water, the water can carry the memory of that substance even after it has been so diluted that none o f the molecules of the original substance remain. 2. The molecules of any given substance have a spectrum of frequencies that can be digitally recorded with a computer, then played back into untreated water and the new water acts as if the actual subst ance were physically present. http://www.spiritof maat.com/ archive/dec3/ Richard, The Number One Handbook of Subtle -Energy Therapies, third edition, Bear & Co: Vermont, 2001. pg. 282. 341 Gerber, Richard, Dr. Vibrational Medicine, The Number One Handbook of Subtle -Energy Therapies, third edition, Bear & Co: Vermont, 2001. pg. 282. 221 Unlike conventional drugs, which work on the physical level, the frequencies of the flowers rehabilitate emotional, mental and spiritua l energies. Improvements in these areas filter down to u pgrade one's physical health. With improved emotions a person's resilience to disease is stre ngthened and internal harmony is increased.342 Dr. Edward Bach, a pioneer in flower essence remedies, noted important personality patterns resulting in 12 lifelong paths that people experience. He believed that people could find their essential nature in one of these personality descriptions. Then he identified flowers with the vibratory energy to u pgrade these emotions. He called this collection of flowers, Soul Flowers. Each personality path is characterized by a challenging emotion. The soul flowers can help people overcome these challenges by raising the energy of a difficult emotion and transforming it i nto a virtue.343 Each flower helps a person master a problematic emotion to obtain the corresponding virtue. Bach claimed that our soul advances by perfecting the flower's associated virtue.344 Dr. Bach was an extreme sensitive who intuited his selection of healing flowers. Today there is quite a process to match a flower with a specific emotion. Specialists observe f lower essence properties including the plant's structure and form, growth pattern, color, chemical properties, herbal uses, as well as energetic properties. These qualities are then correlated with specific human emotions. They test the preliminary indications in clinical settings. This clinical study of the use of essences is called empirical research, or research based on experience. The soul flowers help overcome these emotional difficulties: The Gentian Flower Turns doubt into trust The Cerato Flower Turns self -doubt into inner -certainty 342 Gurudas.

People dedicated to the mastery of an essential virtue for humanity comprise one soul group. An individual can contribute to the evolution of our communities, but the soul group can potentially a chieve success across the planet. As we transform our individual emotional challenges into virtues, we strengthen these divine essences on earth.346 345 Mechthild and Scheffer. Encyclopedia of Bach Flower Remedies, Healing Arts Press: Rochester, Vermont, 2001. Pgs. 44, 58, 62, 76, 81, 95, 120, 128, 152, 172, and 185. 346 Adapted from: Barnard, Julian. Bach Flower Remedies: Form and Function , Lindsisfarne Books: Great Barrington, MA., 2004. pg. 139. 223 Musical Vibrations of Flowers I composed 12 Healing Flower Symphonies using the frequencies and inspiration of the soul flowers . Each symphony creates energy for the emotional transformation as if the listener just ingested the physical flower essences. I obtained the FEs of the soul flowers with the help of an advanced practitioner of vibratory medicine. The process included the use of a sound oscilloscope and a special microphone that made a recording. When a flower petal was near the microphone, a graph of a pitch was created on the computer screen. I duplicated this sound and embedded the appropriate flower frequency into each Healing Flower Symphony. In this manner I incorporated the FE for each flower into the Healing Flower Symphonies.347 Sharry gives us an illustration of giving a person the vitamin niacin. A skin flushing occurs with the use of niacin su pplements. She can provide the FE of niacin to a person and the same skin flushing occur s. Likewise, the emotional benefits of the flower remedies can be passed through the FE of the associated flower. In addition, I utilized my intuition and opened myse lf to the feelings emitted by each soul flower. For example, w hen composing music that replicated the feeling of trust, I considered that trust is deeper than a feeling; it is a knowing, an absolute assurance. Then I envisioned our heartbeat - something that we have heard subtly, but steadily throughout our lives - something that we took comfort from our mother's heartbeat in the womb. This sound is reminiscent of the feeling of trust. After taping the sounds of a heartbeat, I composed a symphony around t his reassuring beat. Then I immersed myself in the feeling of trust and let the musical composition flow from me. The final symphony contains the FE recorded from the particular flower being captured, together with the original composition expressing the emotions of the flower. 347 Another method to accomplish this has been used by Dr. Jacques Benveniste. He records a signal from a substance by using a microphone without a membrane, just an electromagnetic coil. He plugs the electronic coil into the female receptacle of the sound card of a computer. Then he puts the molecules in water in a test tube next to the coil. When those millions of molecules vibrate, it's enough for the coil to pick them up. http://www.spiritof maa t.com/ archive/dec3/ bveniste. htm 224 Each flower essence support s the transformation of a negative emotion into the mastery of it. Initially it seemed counterintuitive to musically create the negative emotion that each soul flower was to remedy. Later, I observed peopl e who repeatedly listened to melancholy and sad music, and then watched them dis card negative emotional baggage which then opened them up to positive feelings. This idea was anything but flawed. I gained this important insight about emotional transformat ions as I played violin for elderly people in a supported living home over the course of a year. When they listened to the music, i t received their full attention as nothing else competed for their focus. Their complete attention made the music more potent . I watched patients who appeared frozen sit in cradled positions with never a glance or word to anyone else. Two months into my visits a gentleman fell flat on his face on the floor. Anxiously I ran to help him and noticed that no one else even glanced his way. After playing violin for three months the residents had not spoken a word to me. No one so much as glanced at me or anyone else. This group was able to speak, but ch ose not to. I wondered why all the people had retreated so deeply. I ref lected t hat after years of pain people are he sitant to be vulnerable and ope n, lest they get hurt again. Invisible yet insidious pain, gathered after years of life's trials, weighed them down and eventually created stagnat ion in their emotional bodies. They were s pending their final years in a nursing home, where their isolation grew. After about four months of performing a small change began to occur - a few talked to me. At first, I attributed this to them warming up to me. Interestingly, several months later th ey started talking to one another. Soon they regularly engaged in social chatting. Now I was certain; the music played a vital role in their healthy emotional improvement. The music stirred old pain, bringing it to the surface. It enabled them to reconnect with feelings that they had long ignored, leading to an emotional catharsis. They loosened the grip of the pain and let it go. Releasing this storehouse of dark energy allowed them to reach out and include others in their lives. It was amazing that when t hey were regularly exposed to emotional, live music that it had such a significant impact on their behavior. 225 The right brain hemisphere processes m usic without words. The right hemisphere also processes patterns, context, creativity, spatial awareness, a nd recognizes faces, places and objects. The left brain hemisphere handles speech, analysis, time and things in sequence. It recognizes letters, numbers and words. Listening to violin music triggers right brain hemisphere usage. This gives people access to their emotions, while bypassing painful memories as it does not process identifying information. The residents experienced sad emotions expressed through a violin solo, without remembering who hurt them. Just feeling the sorrowful emotion over and over again was enough to gradually release it. I question ed if music could increase the intensity of a difficult emotion. I concluded that the answer depends upon one's intentions. To illustrate how our feelings follow our direction, imagine walking into a r oom in which someone is: Furious with you Angry with a stranger Angry at himself . In all cases you can feel anger, but you can also feel where it is directed . One can target an emotion to a certain person and this carries on sound. Can you not tell the d ifference between a hello when a person is angry or happy with you? In my experience at the nursing home, I intended for people to release painful emotions when I played violin. I doubt they considered anything other than fleeting feelings and thoughts generated by the music. In a year's time everyone appeared to socially improve. My intention to enable them to shed emotional baggage is clearly effective. People report incredible healings, especially regarding releases of negative emotions after listeni ng to the Healing Flower Symphonies. Here are two examples: I had an extraordinary healing episode as a result of listening to The Healing Flowers Symphony CD. The music touch ed an annoying fear that I have held for many years. As a highly analytical pe rson I have been very consciously aware of this 226 fear, yet I had also been keenly aware that it had no logical basis. But I have never attempted to deal with it. I have treated it like a thorn in my side, which I was dest ined to carry. After listening , this perennial fear simply dissipated as if it had been dissolved by the music. I know it was the music that was responsible (the \"self -healing\" aspect notwithstanding) because of the extreme resonance that occurred between that fear sensation and specific sections of the song. I was left with a sensation of extreme well being that manifested emotionally as a quiet effortless peace that had displaced the fear and seemed to seep into my whole being, and mentally as a picture of Mother Earth coddling me in he r arms as if I were a small child being rocked to sleep. It was an extraordinary experience .\" Keith David Henry Theoretical Metaphisicist I was afflicted with a bad cold. That evening I could not sleep and no medicine was working. I played the Healing Flower Symphonies and shortly everything that was blocking my respiratory system, throat and digestive system removed itself from my body. I had an immediate full recovery. The next day I talk ed on my radio show with a regular voice and energy. Jill's music is truly powerful, and is on the cutting edge of a rediscovery of ancient remedies that heal the body, mind and spirit. Gary Purifory, Co -Owner of CLN Radio I noticed that people who were not ready to acknowledge their own negative emotional habits, let alone release them, found the releasing portions of this music disturbing. Those who did not have a the associated negative emotion experienced no difficulties listening. For 227 example, a patient person easily listened to the impatient music, while an impati ent person did not. Negative feelings do not disappear by pretending that we do not have them, just like we do not get rid of a bad habit by ignoring it. To eliminate a bad habit, we acknowledge it and choose a better behavior. Likewise, after we feel an d let go of negative emotions, then we can practice and strengthen healthier feelings. With this experience in mind, I feel it is just as important to release negative emotions as it is to build positive ones. Some people are so full of pain, there is lit tle room or desire to incorporate positive feelings. Daniel Levitin describes a positive biological response to sad music, When we are sad, many of us turn to sad music. Why would that be? On the surface of things, you might expect that sad people woul d be uplifted by happy music. But that is not what research shows. Prolactin , a tranquilizing hormone, is released when we're sad. Sorrow does have a physiological purpose and it may be an adaptive response, which is to help us conserve energy and reorient our priorities for the future after a traumatic e vent. Prolactin is also released after orgasm, after birth, and during lactation in females. A chemical analysis of tears reveals that Prolactin is not always present in tears - it is not released in tears of lubrication of the eye, or when the eye is irritated , or in tears of joy: it is only released in tears of sorrow. David Huron sugge sts that sad music tricks' our brain into releasing Prolactin into the safe or imaginary s orrow induced by music and the Prolactin then turns around our mood.348 Each flower's essence deals with the yin and yang of life's conflicts. I start each symphony immersed in the negative emotional qualities of the corresponding flower. The Healing Flower Symphonies musically weave in and out of painful emotions such as fear, distrust and insecurity. The music transports the listener to an emotional space that corresponds to negative feelings they have stored subconsciously. To receive the benefits, the listener must not ignore feeling s, but relive them in order to let them go. As the emotion leaves the listener, he will feel it as it passes out of his body. There are no short cuts to 348 Levitin, Daniel. The World in Six Son gs: How the Musical Brain C reated Human Nature , Penguin Group: N.Y., 2009, pgs. 132 -133. 228 releasing pain. These flower symphonies are not intended for pansies! After the emotional catharsis the flower symphony evolves into triumph, giving the listener a transforming experience of the flower's corresponding positive virtue. For example, one flower's energy addresses the pleaser personality, one who is always nice, but not sincere. This per son readily approves of others to appear pleasant or to avoid conflict. Their true feelings are hidden and an unhealthy emotional pattern persists. Each note of this flower symphony begins in tune, but in a fraction of a second it bends out of tune. This happens so quickly that the listener is not aware of the intonation problem, but the sour after -vibration leaves an unsettling feeling. The music creates a pretending -to-be- nice feeling, just like the person with a pleaser personality. The intonation pr oblem is only noticeable when this section of the music is contrasted with the remainder of the symphony that is in - tune for the entire length of the notes. The melody transitions into deep, calm and pure harmony (sounds like harmony but isn't) . The contra st between pretentious harmony and the real thing is obvious. In this way, listeners can: Be conscious of their feeling of wanting to please Realize how much better it feels to be sincere than agree with everyone and everything Honor their own beliefs The music of the flowers enables us to practice good attributes, such as peace or patience. Repeatedly feeling the emotions associated with a desirable attribute solidifies this pattern . When we feel a certain emotion, people near us feel it too and associat e that emotion with us. For example, a person who is often in a peaceful state is described as peaceful. The mastery of a difficult emotion creates a virtue! Plato (428-347 BC) noted that music evoked admirable emotions of virtue, courage and restraint.349 349 Ferguson, Kitty. The Mus ic of Pythagoras, Walker and Co: N .Y., 2008. 229 To sum up, we can harness energy created by music to help us in many ways. The Healing Flower Symphonies are an example of music crafted to achieve a specific benefit. Appendix A describes the Healing Flower Symphonies in more detail.

Because the spontaneous release of natural tones multiples and foc uses his energy and power. Self created tones affect us from the insid e out! Ouch! Why do we do scream in pain? Sound instinctually releases pain from our bodies, but we forget to credit sound. Natural tones, such as grunts, groans, moans, screams, laughs, yawns and sighs balance our voice and internal sonic wave pool . Sounds such as mmm and ahhh harmonize and balance harmful, stressed frequencies. Without our conscious direction we produce spontaneous sounds and effectively improve internal harmony . Sharry recommends toning these sounds to decrease headaches, sinus p ain and ear/nose/throat infections. Ancient mystic groups chanted the names of god, carefully crafted with rich vowel sounds. Each vowel sound creates emphasis and abundance of various harmonics. Health issues occur when certain harmonic patterns within o ur bodies are distorted and diminished. People believed the names of god s connected them to divine energies, but these sounds also restored harmonic structures within their minds, bodies and emotions. Valerie Hunt, Ph.D., 352 who has degrees in biology, p hysiological psychology, science education and physical therapy, reflects, At a 352 Valerie Hunt established in the 1950s neuromuscular pa tterns of anxiety and anger at a time when the only physiological research of emotions was chemical and behavioral. In the 1960s she added to behavior psychology with her discovery of neuromuscular nerve stimulation patterns related to nonverbal communicat ion, In the 1970's she developed a high frequency device, AuraMeter, to record electrical energy from the human's body surface. Trivieri, Larry, Jr. Health on the Edge , Penguin Group: N.Y., 2003 , pg. 185. 233 young age we begin the process of repressing natural sounds and thus begins our journey of learning to be vehicles of storage, rather than what we are naturally meant to be, w hich are vehicles of expression. Toning helps us to express again - by using these natural sounds to release pent -up or blocked energy and re -establish a natural flow of energy. This leaves the physical body feeling peaceful and cleansed.353 In Part Two Technical Details, we discussed how the voice 's frequencies are distributed among the predictive , acute and long term categories . Slower vibratory cycles of sound have not solidified into a physical problem in our body, yet. They are still pliable, easily molded and harmonized. Toning enables us to balance these tones before they become problematic. Hunt observed that when the body's electromagnetic pattern is disturbed, disease and malfunction develop.354 A flexible range of frequencies creates health . She reports that people need a large quantity of energy in the various frequenc y bands. She refers to this quantity of energy as power. People with power in the lower ranges will be physically active and have a dynamic life. Lower frequencies keep the cell s and organs working together. Power in the middle ranges of this spectrum enables people to handle intellectual issues and gives them problem -solving abilities. Power in the upper ranges enables people to go into higher ranges of consciousness and utiliz e wisdom and conceptual thinking. The ideal is to have the full range of frequencies.355 Toning creates power in all of these frequency ranges. Hunt measures people's energy in the frequency spectrum. People with cancer suppress their emotions, staying in w hat they perceive to be positive emotions. They do not have a full spectrum of frequencies , going from low to high frequencies. Hunt generally describes cancer patients, They are sweet, lovable people. That is their emotional orie ntation. They aren't agg ressive and they don't have the lower frequencies that have to do with tissue vitality. Without tissue vitality, the cell becomes cancerous. But the difficulty is that some of these people would rather die than giv e into the very 353 http://www.toning.org/toning.html 354 Trivieri, La rry, Jr. Health on the Edge , Penguin Group: N.Y., 2003. pg. 187. 355 Trivieri, Larry, Jr. Health on the Edge , Penguin Group: N.Y., 2003. pg. 192. 234 intense, angry and hostile emotions that they have.356 Toning enables us to reach all frequency levels, empowering ourselves on many levels: spiritual, physical, mental and emotional. Free flowing energy is essential to good health and positive well -being. Toning is an ancient, sou nd healing practice. Sharry has long employed a form of this technique. We may not have her special abilities to voice sine waves, but toning create s sounds to heal and soothe others and ourselves. At the end of this section a brief description of how to t one is provided - so you can practice healing with your voi ce too! The frequencies of feelings combine with sounds. Our subconscious feelings are part of our spoken words. The quality of our tone communicates our underlying intent and the feelings beneat h our words. For example, the hello we say to someone we love is different than the hello we say to someone we do not like. Our emotional communication is clearly included in our tone of voice, speaking louder than our words. When we consciously censo r our spoken words, these censored ideas remain in our tone of voice. We may not even be aware of these subtle underlying feelings, but some sense them. Animals can become adept at reading our tones and seem to understand the words we are speaking. We oft en suppress voicing our deep feelings. Many times we do not speak our truth, as we are taught to be polite or kind instead. Sometimes the truth is painful or we do not want to acknowledge that we are angry. Those who suppress negative feelings are deemed polite and kind. Let's look at an example of the habitual white lie. How often do we tell people we feel fine, when we are not? Or nothing is new, when we do not want to share something new? Or that we like something, when we do not? Sometimes we forget what our truth is, because we have hidden it in our subconscious minds. Sound carr ies our hidden feelings back to us. Our tone of voice is a communication link to our subconscious mind.357 356 Trivieri, Larry, Jr. Health on the Edge , Penguin Group: N.Y., 2003. pg. 186. 357 Dewhurst Madock, Olivea. The Book of Sound Therapy , Simon and Schuster: 1993. 235 When our feelings and words are not in alignment, we create disson ance in our bodies. In contrast, speaking our truth sets us free. Toning for Health Toning (a glissando sound ) creates all FEs that our voice can produce. It bathes us in the full gamut of enriching sounds. This gives our brain a fertile frequency bank to select from and eventually duplicate needed frequencies. When we cannot keep our thoughts and moods positive, sound can reestablish coherent frequencies in our bodies, refresh our energies and improve our health. Toning clears stuck negative energies, repressed thoughts and buried feelings. Sound can restore the body's natural resonance. Toning gives us an entire body tune -up! Laurel Keyes writes that, The purpose of toning is to restore the vibratory pattern of the body to its perfect electromagneti c field, so that it will function in harmony with itself.358 Laurel Keyes writes about a small group of people who toned vowel sounds while imagining the tone going through another's body. Laurel reports tumors healed, cancers cured and other marvelous effects from this technique.359 When we tone, we sing vowel sounds while changing our pitch. Vowel sounds carry our feelings, especially the ones we hide from ourselves. Vowel sounds such as ooooooh and aaaaaaaah are emotionally expressive and good to us e when toning . In contrast, consonants help us express thoughts. Toning for Others 1. Face another individual or imagine him across from you. 2. Close your eyes. 3. Relax, keep your teeth apart and muscles loose. 4. Tune into your own feelings and p ut your thoughts aside. 5. Set your intentions. Expect to clear energy blockages in the other person. (Placebos are often effective because a positive belief is a 358 Keyes, Laurel Elizabeth. The Creative Power of the Voice. De Vorss Publishers: CA., 1973. 359 Keyes, Laurel Elizabeth. The Creative Power of the Voice, .De Vorss Publishers: CA., 1973. 236 powerful energy. It is important that you believe you can heal another - intention is critica l.) 6. Pretend the tone starts below the other person's feet and passes up into his feet, legs and traveling through his body, moving towards his head. 7. Utter the lowest pitch of any vowel sound that you can. Utter a sound such as ooooooooohhhh and t hen VERY SLOWLY let the tone smoothly rise in pitch. Keep singing the vowel sound as long as you comfortably can. Take a breath whenever necessary and resume on the same pitch that you left off at. Only let the pitch rise when it easily and effortlessly ri ses up. If you push, even a little to raise your voice, then go down to a lower pitch and remain there until the pitch rises, as if it did so on its own. 8. Listen carefully to your sound as it slowly rises. There will be cracks in the sound and places wh ere the sound is uneven, softer or weaker. When this occurs, stay on this pitch, and then repeat sliding just above and just below the pitch until your voice is smooth and strong. 9. A cracking pitch corresponds to a place in the other person's body where an energy blockage is occurring. If you are unsure of where this spot is, do not worry; just correct the cracking in the tone and the energy blockage will clear. 10. If you feel in your imagination that the tone goes right or left, as well as up or down, honor that feeling. If you cannot imagine this, have faith that the negative energy is clearing. 11. After you reach the top of the head, extend the toning up for about three feet and then allow your tone to slowly decrease in pitch. Imagine the tone comin g down through the person's body. 12. Use your imagination and see your tone run through the person's body from top to bottom, bottom to top, and again as necessary until you get a smooth, strong siren tone without any cracking or soft spots. Go up and do wn until your voice smoothly and easily glides up and down. 13. Laurel Keyes reports that she tones on average for 15 minutes per person. If someone is seriously ill, Laurel tones with others and for longer tim e periods. She may continue toning every day for several weeks. 14. Toning increases in power when more people tone - to aid the same person at the same time. 15. Feel gratitude for being able to raise the energy in another person's body. 237 Toning for Yourself 1. Close your eyes and imagine t hat your body is a black ink well. As you utter tones visualize clear water coming into the ink well with each breath, until you and the ink well are pristine clear. 2. Let out a vowel sound (any one you feel comfortable with) or even groan on the lowest p itch that you can. For example, you could utter the vowel sound, aaaaaahhhh. 3. Let your body speak, not your mind. Do not worry about how you sound, but concentrate on how the sound makes your body feel. Be entirely absorbed in your sound and let it ris e from within you, as if this sound is separate from you. You are just observing the sound. 4. Imagine the tone begins below your feet and works its way up the body until it reaches the top of your head, and then above your head three feet. This could tak e 15 minutes to 30 minutes or more. The first time that you tone, it may take longer to clear built-up energy blockages. Tone daily for increased improvements .360 5. As you imagine your tone going from your feet to your head, the pitch of your tone will also rise. Allow the tone to rise in pitch when the body wants it to. The pitch will glide up effortlessly when it is ready. Never push to raise your voice. 6. Any area in which the pitch takes a while to rise, or where your voice cracks or skips tones, is an area with an energy blockage. Do not get louder to break through the energy blockage: that only produces a quick fix. Gently continue toning and give your voice all the time it needs to raise in pitch. If you stay on a pitch for 5 to 10 minutes or more, t hen you are receiving a great healing! 7. If your voice doesn't rise right away, imagine seeing your tone going right or left in your body and finding a path eventually that leads upward. Honor the path the tone wants to take. 8. Direct feelings of harmon y and well -being to the spot where you imagine the blockage to be. Imagine pure and beautiful light filling this area. Believe that you are healing. Love your body. 9. Once you tone above your head, then reverse directions and let your voice slide down whi le you are singing the vowel sound. Imagine the sound going down your body and up again until your voice is crystal clear and smooth. 10. If you do this regularly, you will feel energized, refreshed and healthier. Watch negative emotions melt from your th inking! 360 Health is not a black and white issue. There are many degrees of sickness and health. Your health can get better and better! 238 The first time I toned, I unknowably had an energy blockage at the bottom of my feet, as I was not grounded. I assumed that toning did not work, because I toned for ten minutes without my voice rising and easily sliding up on its own. After the to ne worked through the blockage at my feet, my voice slowly climbed. While you tone, notice which sounds you like best. Are there sounds that make you smile, relax, breathe easier and you simply enjoy? These frequencies will produce a vibrating sensation and perhaps reduce the pain of a headache, sinus, ear or throat pain. Continue to tone these sounds. This is your body's way of saying that it needs these frequencies . Ideally, hum them until they no longer appeal to you. When I tone my sound often creat es rhythmic patterns. Often you need pitches and rhythmic patterns. Let your voice create what sounds and rhythms that you need. Which vowel sounds do you prefer? Remember that a tone carries with it a spectrum of more or less audible harmonics. The pecul iar sounds a clarinet produces resonate only with only odd numbered harmonics. The flute's pure sound concentrat es its energy in the root note. In contrast, the soft sounds of the French horn create a weak fundamental and a strong second harmonic. Likewise , each vowel creates different harmonics. Joscelyn Godwin emphasizes just how much the energy of a pitch lies in a harmonic and relates that, Dayton Miller found that the resonance of the vowels ma, maw, mow, and moo amplify a single harmonic as much as 90 percent of the total energy of the sound.361 Recall that Sharry has documented harmonic series within the body. Faults in the harmonic series in the body parallel health issues. The vowel sounds that you enjoy the most will be the ones that your bod y prefers to strengthen internal harmonic series. I experimented with toning when I had a headache, following Sharry 's method . I cannot make the special sounds that she does, but I allowed my voice to slide up and down. Amazingly , I found one tone that ac centuated the pain of my headache. It was a painful di scovery, 361 Godwin, Joscelyn. The Mystery of the Seven Vowels: In Theory and Practice, Phanes Press: MI., 1991. pg. 13. 239 but it was a discovery nonetheless. After finding this tone I continued to allow my voice to slide around and I found another tone (about six musical notes away) that got rid of the headache. I also noted that humming seemed to send tones into the head region more so than singing a tone did. I used the nanoVoice reports to strengthen my toning. I toned during my nanoVoice recording and my voice slid in and out of every pitch in my voice range. The notes that I got stuck on matched the weak tones documented in my voiceprint. It was as if my body need ed more of the frequency that my voice got stuck on for any length of time. I continued to sing the missing notes. I felt more energized and less tempted to slip in to a down feeling when I toned a missing frequency. Toning also had an immediate effect on the predictive frequencies within my voice, providing improved coherence. Repeated toning corrected frequency patterns in the acute range of frequencies, but I have yet to budge the chronic voice coherence imbalances after many toning sessions. Perhaps prolonged toning sessions will help. I suspected that my weak tones were due to harmonic faults . I continued with experimentation. As a singer, I know several techniques to produce fuller harmonics in the voice, as this produces a warmer, thic ker and richer sound. One way is to stand straight and concentrate on the sound reverberating within your spine. This makes your tones fuller and richer, as it strengthens the harmonics in your voice. The second method to enhance harmonics is not only breathing deeply, but to let your belly feel as if it was so relaxed that it was falling on the floor. The third technique is to pull back the skin on your fore head, as if you were raising your eyebrows. These singing techniques can be employed at the same time as toning and amplify the positive effects of toning. Employing these exercises improved the rate at which my voice gained coherence. 240 Chapter Five The Sounds of Silence Many people feel uncomfortable with silence. We live our lives surrounded by lawnmowers, traffic, TVs, sirens, mp3 players and horns. We hear little silence let alone subtleties of sound that are only apparent during silence. Many fi nd comfort with constant noise . The TV endlessly talks to them . Do we escape silence to avoid feeling alone or vulnerab le? Do we avoid being alone with our feelings and innermost thoughts? Spiritual le aders have long revered silence: Silence is the a ltar of God.362 Be still and know that I am God.363 When we go into the inner chamber and shut the door to every sound that comes from life without, then the voice of God will speak to our soul, and we will know the key note of our life. 364 My Soul couns eled me and charged me to listen for voices that rise neither from the tongue nor the throat, Before that day I heard but dully, and naught save clamor and loud cries came to my ears, But now I have learned to listen to silence, To hear its choirs singing the songs of ages, Chanting the hymns of space, and disclosing the secrets of eternity.365 We may not be able to hear otoacoustic emissions as Sharry does, but there are beneficial sounds that we can focus on. Focused inner listening amplifies the sounds of our heart, circ ulatory and respiratory systems and our subtle chorus of inner sounds. The 362 Paramahansa Yogananda 363 Old Testament, Bible. 364 Hazrat Inayat Kan. Music of Life , Omega Publishing: New Leba non, N.Y., 1983. 365 Kahlil Gibran 241 ability to perceive these subtle inner sounds and receive associated benefits can be developed. Mystics profess that as one journeys t owards enlightenment, a ser ies of subtle, internal sounds may be heard in quiet meditation . People have professed to hear the: Pounding of the surf of the sea Humming of bees Tinkling of soft bells Ringing of soft bells Chirping of crickets Babbling water of a brook Rumbling of t hunder Roaring of a lion Blowing of a conch shell Gong of a big drum Strings of a harp Tone of a flute Sound of bag pipes Absence of all sound366 The Bible also refers to this inner hearing: And I heard the voice from heaven. Like the sound of many waters, like the sound of loud thunder, the voice I heard was like the sounds of harpers playing on their harps.367 The Rosicrucians, a mystic group, believed the famed music of the spheres that Pythagoras and many other historical giants wrote about correspo nded to the frequency -equivalents of the human spine. They measured and weighed each vertebra of the human spine, discovering that the ratio of weight between each vertebra was the same as the ratio between the notes of a chromatic scale. The weights of th e vertebra corresponded to the harmonic series. They believed that when both hemispheres of the brain were synchronized or in harmony 366 Van Dyke, Deborah. Traveling the Sacred Sound Current , Sound Current Music: Bowan Island, B.C. Canada, 2001, pg. 147. 367 Bible . Revelations 14:2. 242 that a vibration was created in the spine and heard inside the head, creating the Music of the Spheres.368 Many sages cre dit the proper use of sound with great wisdom. It offers profound spiritual growth and puts pilgrims on the spiritual fast-track. Below are quotes from a variety of spiritual disciplines, reflecting on the power of sound and our hearing abilities. Orige n369 described hearing as a readiness of the soul towards God. True inner hearing has not been perfected until one can hear the sounds in a seed, in a leaf... When one unites with the archetone,' giving life to all forms, he unites with the cosmic music of the universe. Finally, one unites with the tone of his own direct star from whence he came.370 Upon the wings of sound, the way of higher evolution is traveled.371 At first only the light works, but when one goes deeper into creation there is sound. When one is face to face with spirit, what is first expressed is the light or what one first responds to is light; and what one responds to next, and what touches one deeper, is sound.372 While information and knowledge, the fruits of pursuing the light, provid e relative peace and spiritual progress, they pale in comparison to the higher God attributes of truth, love, wisdom and freedom and power which the awakened Sound Current imbued within the sincere seeker of truth... These attributes are enlivened by bathing in the audible Life Stream.373 Sound is a tremendous occult (meaning hidden) power. It is such a stupendous force that the electricity generated by a million Niagara Falls could never counteract even the smallest potentiality of sound when directed by pro per knowledge.374 368 LaVoie, Nichole. Return to Harmony: Creating Harmony and Balance throu gh the Frequencies of Sound, Sound Wave Energy Press: Pagosa Springs, Co., 1996. pgs. 87 - 88. 369 According to some sources, Origen (C185 -351) was a key figure in the First Council of Nicaea, disagreeing with the emperor, Constantine. 370 Colton, Ann Ree. The Archetypal Kingdom quoted from Van Dyke, Deborah. Traveling the Sacred Sound Current, Sound Current Music: Bowan Island, B.C. Canada, 2001, pg. 144 . 371 Tibetan Master Djwhal Khul (in works by Alice Bailey) 372 Khan, Inayat, Hazra t.

The Secret Doctrine. 243 For there is nothing in this world that can help one spiritually more than music. Meditation prepares, but music is the highest for touching perfection.375 Since the difference between one dimension and another is its rate of vibration, t he key to the transformation of the spirit lies within the music. 376 It is not a fairy tale that the saints used to speak with the trees and plants. You can speak with them today if you are in communication. Man has the same privilege today, if he realize s that he is privileged.377 There is a time to rend and a time to sew, a time to keep silence and a time to speak.378 Pythagoras and Plato said that the nature of the soul is sound. The person who has fou nd the keynote of his own voice has found the key o f his own life.379 Other words that mystics su bstitute for our fundamental frequency could be aura, prana or chi. Some religions refer to this sound as the Holy Spirit, the Original Sound and a group called the Ecks associates this sound with God. To hea r our fundamental frequencies , focus attention on a sound that is nearby. Next, adjust your hearing to listen to a sound that is far away. Continue changing your listening focus, going back and forth. This eventually creates a high pitched sound, similar t o a ringing sound in our ears. This is our personal sound. This sound feeds our bodies and energies, improving the coherence of our voice. Another way to access your fundamental frequencies is to plug your ears and then listen carefully to subtle internal sounds. Find whatever means works best to bl ock out extraneous sounds, such as using earplugs or placing a pillow over the ears. All that matters is that outside sound is effectively blocked out and that you are comfortable and able to concentrate. 375 Khan, Inayat, Hazrat . The Music of Life, Omega Publishing: New Lebanon, N.Y., 1983. pg. 140. 376 Pritchard, Evan. The Temple Within, from Van Dy ke, Deborah.

The Music of Life , Omega Publishing: New Lebanon , N.Y ., 1983. pg. 275. 244 Alternatively, imagine that each sound you hear can be locked in an imaginary bag that completely muffles the sound. One by one put the sound of traffic, the refrigerator, the airpl ane flying overhead and so on into the sound tight bag. Let all these sounds go and then listen for the sound that comes from within. When we screen out distractions we amplify our subtle inner sounds. In contrast, w hen we ignore these subtleties, they fade into the background and seem to disappear altogether. To benefit from this gift, we must give it our deepest attention. We are a part of the miracle! Many sit quietly in meditation for quite some time before they percei ve these subtle sounds. As they focus on slight sounds, they hear their nervous or circulatory systems, heartb eat or other internal sounds. Tinnitus is not a common condition. Tinnitus usually results from inner ear damage. The little sounds of silence could be confused with tinnitus. With tinnitus someone hears the same pitch, volume and quality of sound all the time. You can amplify these subtle sounds at will simply by focus ing on them. These sounds change dep ending on the time of day, how you feel and wi th your state of consciousness . While in a meditative state, pretend t o hear tiny sounds. Trust your imagination to amplify extremely soft, su btle and high -pitched sounds. Internal sounds may be mechanical sounding, like a ringing in your ears, the white noise on TV or it could sound like nature... such as the ocean, cricke ts or rain. As you focus on internal sound s they become louder. Close your eyes and move into the sounds with your feelings. Allow sound to come around you, like a cloak. At first listen you may hear one sound, but with additional concentration you may hear that the tone is comprised of a multitude of softer and shorter frequencies. Just like a white light can be divided into a rainbow of frequencies, internal sounds can be divided into component pitches and patterns. 245 Can you separate the sounds coming from each ear? By focusing your attention on one ear the sound will increase in that ear. You can now pan the sounds back and forth between your ears. After I do this several times I focus the sounds in the center of my head. Internal sounds are now like surround sound. I imagine these sound s to be filled with light and expanding to encompass my entire head and the area a round it. I imagine I have a ha lo of sweet sounds. Over time these subtle sounds morph. What begi ns sounding like a cricket may end up ten minutes later resembling the sou nd of the ocean. I went through many months that I only heard crickets and then suddenly my internal sounds were similar to the howling of the wind. It was fascinating to play with these sounds. If I heard a dominant sound, I sometimes chanted along with it, increasing the volume of my inner hearing. Singing an octave below the pitch grounded me, giving me a feeling of solidity and power. Humming the octave above appeared to increase my intuition and connection to spirit. Toning , while focusing on these in ner sounds , seemed to bring me into balance. I focus on these soft fundamental frequencies in quiet moments, but I can also hear them while shopping or doing the dishes. When I focus on these sounds it is as if I twisted the volume button and pumped up the sounds. Various traditions in antiquity, suggest that chanting the phrase, I am that I am, prepares one to hear the sounds of silence. The actual sound of this phrase varied from language to language, but each included long vowel sounds that resonated subtle feelings within our being. The audible resonance and the internal feelings of being one with our creator combine to raise our overall vibrations so we can to better hear the sound of silence. According to experts on mantras, Brian and Ester Crowley , participating in sacred sound improves our intuition, consciousness and inner hearing.380 The actual sounds of many ancient languages were considered potent and are still used for spiritual purposes, from Sanskrit mantras to Latin masses. Correct pronunc iation and our internal feelings of 380 Crowl ey, Brian and Est er. Words of Power: Sacred Sounds of E ast and West , Llewellyn Publications, Minn.1991.

Those who produce many theta brain waves are highly creative, less rigid and conforming and healthy. They also experience life altering insights, improved relationships as well as greater tolerance, understanding and love of one's self and world.383 While in the theta brain wave state our intentions and spoken words are more powerful. The theta state corresponds to feelings that resonate with this id ea: I am in perfect harmony. 381 Crowley, Brian and Esther.

Meditatin g to Hear the \"Sounds of Silence\" People may have to increase their meditation skills to be able to listen to silence for a half -hour before they hear their subtle sounds or they may hear them immediately. If you are not familiar with meditation techniques, here are ideas to still your mind long enough to hear these subtle sounds. Not one method of medita ting is better than the other , but people have decided preferences for one or another. Focusing on a single image in your mind's eye can produc e a meditative stillness. For example, think of a rose and time how long you can keep this image without something else popping into your mind. Typically people can keep their mind steady for about ten seconds. Focus on only one feeling, such as peace, and extend this for as long as you can. Another meditation technique is to stare at a candle flame and concentrate only on what you see. When a distracting thought enters your mind, pinpoint where the intruding thought i s in your head. For example, the thought came from one inch above your right ear and about two inches inside the skull. Imagine a ghostly hand coming from above your head and plucking the thought from where it came ... one inch above your right ear and two inches deep... and this imaginary ha nd throws the distracting thought away. When another interrupting thought enters your head, repeat the same process. After you do this four or five times you enter stillness, without distracting thoughts. If none of these techniques are successful, try a guided meditation, in which someone speaks to you and simply follow along . After mastering this, proceed to other meditation techniques. 248 Vasopressin increases memory and stimulates the release of endorphins.388 Catecholamines are vital for memory and learning.389 Melatonin helps us sleep. As people age, they fail to get enough sleep , which the body needs to regenerate. Theta brain waves increase melatonin levels on average by 98%.390 Cortisol speeds up the body's aging mechanisms. Cortisol levels drop during theta brain waves.391 DHEA increases one's resistance to disease. DHEA buffers against cortisol that we produce in response to stress.392 Serotonin plays an important role in the central nervous system as a neurotransmitter in the modulation of anger , aggression , body temperature , mood , sleep , human sexuality , appetite , and metabolism .393 Focusing on our fundamental frequency and entering the silence, which facilitates healing theta brainwaves , is a great way to receive inform ation such as answers to prayer. Let's say we are nervous; we can use the sounds of silence technique to receive guidance. First, get calm , still and listen to our inner sounds. Now, whatever comes to mind is our message from the inner core of our body and soul. For example, one could say, Do I need this vitamin? The answer can come from within, through feelings or in symbolic pictures. The communication or enlightenment that we receive is called many things. In Christianity it is called the Holy Spirit, in other disciplines it is called the Higher Self and there are other names a s well. Our fundamental frequency and the sounds of silence are frequency representations of ourselves. They come from everything that we think, feel, eat and do; from the clothes we wear, the person we sit beside, the ground we walk on, the chairs we sit in and everything that happens to us and within us. Perhaps Jesus understood this because in the Bible . He said , As a man thinketh, so is he. 388 Research Behind Acoustic Brain Entr ainment, pg. 9. www.neuroacoustic.org. 389 Dr. Margaret Patterson in collaboration with biochemist Dr. Ifor Capel at the Marie Curie Cancer Memorial Foundation Research Dept. in Surrey, England.

For example, a guru insisted on cooking his own food and cleaning his own laundry, claiming that if the cook was disgruntled then the cook's negative energy would blend with his food and become part of him. Therefore, he cooked and washed, while feeling peace and love. Wearing clothes that were lovingly washed put the feeling of love next to his skin - an organ with the ability to take in much energy through its extensive pores. He also ate vegetarian food lest he incorporate the horror of a cruel execution of an anim al into his flesh and blood while eating meat . At one time I thought this was extreme; then, I reflected that Sharry could hear different sounds from a red shirt or a blue one, the Templar cross and a good versus bad mood. The se tones interact with us as we incorporate all things around us into our energy. The things that we surround ourselves with become a part of ourselves. Listening to the sounds of silence triggers the production of brain waves that stimulate our greater health , awareness , consciousness and well-being. Improving our integrity and harmony improves our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual energies. Listening to our fundamental frequencies will hasten this blessed journey , chang ing our lives. Chapter Six Changing your Voice Sound profoundly interact s with and influe nces matter. Photographs capture sound forming intricate shapes with various physi cal materials. As mentioned in Part Two, Swiss physicist Hans Jenny made videos of sound creating shapes in sand. Similarly, Masuro Emoto photographed water freezing while being exposed to various types of sound and music. The resulting crystalline structure of the frozen 250 water varied depending on the sounds that the freezing water was subjected to. These phenomena reveal sound's potential to mold and alter the human body. Finally, Sharry demonstrates the powerful relationships between our voice, brain waves and health. Sound profoundly interact s with and influence s matter , emotions and energy . Why not consciously change the sounds in our voices for targeted benefits? Exercise: Identifying and Changing Voice Qualities We can make changes to our voice in terms of: Volume Speed Pitches Dynamics of changing pitches Emotions carried on sounds Rhythm of phrasing Tempo Amount of breath in our voice Swallowing or proje cting our voice Posture Equalization (EQ), which increases/decreases either high or low harmonics in a given pitch Experiment changing each one of these variables and notice how your new voice changes the way you feel. Exaggerating each effect enhances the degree of change. Also, o thers will al so feel differently about you when you use these different sounds in your voice. Different voice s yield interesting results. What message does a person who speaks rapidly convey versus one who speaks slowly and deliberately? How might we change the rhythm in our voice to subtly change the energy of our words? People who want to be more assertive should speak louder. One can sense a lack of strength in a feeble voice. An increase in the volume of a voice creates a firmer impression. Many have played with the EQ button on their stereos. Turning up the EQ button to incr eases the treble qualities of sound , making it appear high-pitched and thin. In contrast, increasing the bass creates tones 251 that feel slower , heavi er and more grounded . Have fun with your voice by turning up the treble and contrasting that by adding more bass. You can change the pitch of your voice at appropriate times. If you wish to be forceful, add bass to your voi ce to make it thick and full. In an experiment , I shov ed a friend with my fingers while she wa s speaking. When she sp oke with lower tones it was harder to push her . She wa s more rooted, grounded and stronger simply by lowering her voice! Exercise: Injecting Emotion into Words The voi ce link s our conscious mind with unconscious emotions. We experience emotions every second, whether or not we are conscious of them. Sounds strike a chord and tap our emotions through sympathetic resonance. When we speak, we engage emotions through reson ance. We may not be conscious of this, but we can increase our awareness of subtle emotions. In fact, we can consciously select them! We experience subtle feelings all the time, although we are not conscious of them. Easily we act out of alignment with t hese subtleties, creating inner di scord. Concentrated attention on our tiny feelings heightens our awareness of them, allowing us to act in greater harmony. The truth sets us free! We achieve inner power when we act in alignment with subtle feelings. Whe n people speak their deep truth their walls come down and they allow you access to them. People believe and respect those who communicate with transparency. We achieve an influential power among others when we master attunement with our words and feelings. This mastery begins by directing our attention to little feelings all the time and recognizing these same feelings in our words. It is not difficult, but requires persistence and concentration to notice these small variations in our feelings. This exercise improve s your ability to increase your awareness of emotional meaning within your spoken words. Select a feeling from the following list; then say a nonsensical sentence while focusing 252 intently to convey the selected feeling . For example, repeat Ja ck be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack jump over the candlestick, while deeply emoting each feeling from the list below: I am important. What I am saying is significant. I think I am falling in love I am sick and tired of life. I've had it with you. No one l ikes me. I care about you. Don't mess with me. Help me. I understand. I have a secret. I like you. You are boring. Hazrat Inayat Khan elaborates , What one speaks' is louder than what one says.394 Successfully completing the exercise above illustrate s this! The nanoVoice can document your success in this exercise. Another way to fine tune your emotional overtones is to envision different roles that you may assume, such as teacher, mother, father, lover or friend. How does your voice change when your role changes? Can you be more effective in these roles if you perfect a fitting voice for each role? Notice that your voice and power of your messages may change even when your perspective changes. Also observe that your voice varies with your thoughts and fee lings. For example , a teacher who thinks and feels the words she speaks enables students to get the lesson quicker than one who uses words without feelings and thoughts. Select a desirable personality trait and observe how a person with that trait speaks . How is his voice different? When we copy his voice quality, we also create the energy of this desired attribute. 394 Khan, Hazrat, Inayat, The Music of Life , Omega Publishing: New Lebanon, N.Y., 1983, pg. 43. 253 Recall a person's voice that is full of confidence . A confident person has a balanced voiceprint. The feeling of confidence is subtly carrie d on words. If you speak with confidence, you will also feel and project confidence. People will respond to you differently when you use this confident voice quality. Next time you watch experts discussing a topic on TV, notice each speaker's voice. The y fight over the limelight, each voicing their opinion louder than the next. Two or more talk at the same time, hoping to solo their opinion. The loudest spoken person does not necessarily win, but the one with the strongest charisma or power. When th e speaker believes in his words and exudes a strong feeling, others listen. People will listen to what we have to say too, when we use power in our words. Exercise: Reconnecting with the Energy of Past Voices Our voice has changed many times throughout o ur lives reflecting physical, mental and emotional metamorphoses. For example, our voice at two years old was different than the voice we possessed at ages 17, 40 or 80. Our voice is also much different when we are depressed, in love or after we land that big contract at work. When in a meditative state, imagine a time in the past. How did your voice sound then? Now, say your name aloud, while still pretending that you are in the past. For example, I vividly imagine being at a picnic when I was eight year s old and I say, I am Jill. I listen and feel the innocent emotions in my words. Now select another memory, recreating the situation in your imagination and say your name again. How does it feel? Does it sound differently than the earlier voice? Our va rious voices contain the energy that we experienced at different times. Below are some advantageous applications of this simple process. What was the best moment of your life? What did your voice sound like? If you recreate the voice, then you recreate the energy of that moment. When you express this voice, you experience the accompanying energy. 254 When have you felt the closest to God? What did your voice sound like then? Recreate that voice and you will go to that space, feeling the same divine connect ion! Remember a scene from childhood and submerse yourself in it. Now you can speak and hear your child's voice. If you go back early enough you will hear innocence and purity in your voice. Bring back those beautiful qualities by speaking as you did then. Recall a painful time, when your voice radiated negative emotions. Imagin e reliving this event, but talk in an uplifting voice. This can change your perception of your painful memory so you move away from it. This can also facilitate an emotional transfor mation or release of the stored negative energy associated with this situation. Exercise: Elements in the Voice Another variation of consciously using our voice to create positive change is demonstrated i n the next exercise. In this case we are going to incorporate sounds of the following fundamental elements into our voice:395 Metal Air Water Wood Fire Earth Many systems from civilizations across time and the globe compare elemental energy to all energy and use this comparison as a tool for balancing en ergy. Different cultures use various elements to represent similar energy. The energies do not vary, but how they are categorized changes among healing systems. The elements represent energy that can be detected in our voices :396 Metal has the feel of cla rity and resonance. Some good teachers have metallic voices that keep the class awake and command 395 Vibrations pass from five distinct phases while changing from fine to gross. Each element - ether, air, fire water, earth - has a savor, color and form peculiar to itself. Khan, Hazrat, Inayat, The Music of Life , Omega Publishing: New Lebanon, N.Y., 1983 , pg. Fabien. Sound and Acupuncture Press: Boulder, 1997. Khan, Hazrat, Inayat, The Music of Life , Omega Publishing: New Lebanon, N.Y., 1983, pg. 95. 255 attention. In an unbalanced state people with this voice can be overly meticulous or overwhelming in crowded places. Air has the feel of uplifting energy, ta king one away from the earthly plane. This voice does not feel grounded or weighted down. Water emulates kindness and understanding. It can be intoxicating, soothing, healing and uplifting. A person with this voice links words and ideas. In an unbalanced state this voice type can be draining and sad. Wood has the feel of a soft and vibrant nature. A person with this sensitive voice needs peace and quiet. Fire emits enthusiasm , loving vibrations and can transmit joy. This quality can convey impressive, exc iting, arousing and awakening impression s. On the flip side fire can be horrifying. When a person with this voice is unbalanced he can be overwhelming, to the point of hysteria. Earth creates stillness, security, quietude, slow movement, reflection and a calm low pitch. It can offer hope , inspir ation , encouragement and tempt ation . In an unbalanced condition, this person is slow and depress ed. Which of these elemental sounds are in your voice? Your sounds may change over time reflecting your mood. Practic e usin g all of these elemental sounds. Strengthen the feelings associated with your words by adding the appropriate elemental sound. The chart below details some targeted actions that a deliberate voice creates. Vocal Feng Shui Benefit Elemental Soun ds To be flexib le Put water sounds in your voice To increase strength Add an earthy sound To let go of the past Use an airy voice To command immediate attention Increase fiery sounds in your voice To calm someone down Express an earthy sound in your voice To express compassion Strengthen watery sounds 256 You can manipulate your voice to create more of what you want in life. Use the elemental sounds in your voice to become more powerful, just as a persuasive speaker sways his audience. Use the voice sounds to balance troublesome relationships. Your voice subtly affects people; a fiery voice repels a metallic one, while it gives stability to the airy voice. A person with an earthy voice can make a water person feel stifled, while it soothes a fiery v oice. Fabien Maman sums up voice energies, The voice expresses perfectly' inner fear, anger, sadness or joy , and reveals even more subtle nuances which are related not only to emotions, but to a person's level of consciousness. 397 Exercise: Empowering Your Words In antiquity, some mystery -school398 students pr onounced each letter in the alphabet with as much love as they could convey. After hours of practice, they then lovingly uttered a single word. They continued saying many words until all that flo wed out of their mouths reflected love. The practice of saying words from their hearts and not just their mouths changed the way others responded to them . In a similar exercise, visualize each letter of a word surrounded in white light. Using your imagi nation, slowly inhale the word and pretend to assimilate the light around each letter. Now s ay each letter and visualize its light going down your spine and radiating out to all parts of y our body. After this exercise, does th e word sound differently? How do you feel ? Throughout antiquity spiritual groups placed solemn emphasis on sacred words. The Sufi master, Hazrat Inyat Khan, said, As we delve into the mysteries of life we discover the whole secret is hidden in what we call words. All occult science , all mystical practices are based upon the science of the word or sound.399 Evolved beings are said to carry energy and intent on their voices. Jesus is well known for his healing miracles, many of which were triggered by his words 397Maman, Fabien. Sound and Acupuncture . Tama -Do Press: Boulder, CO., 1997. pg. 22. 398 In history mystery schools were guarded and hidden schools that taught higher spiritual knowledge to a select few, so that powerful secrets would not be available to unscrupulous people. 399Khan, Inayat, Hazrat. The Music of Life, Omega Publishing: New Lebanon, N.Y. , 1983. pg. 228. 257 and commands. The Sufi' s understand this phenomenon. The word will have power according to the illumination of the soul.400 With practice, we can increase the power in our own words. Down through the ages, many groups projected energy in words to increase their consciousness , intellect, he alth, emotions and spirituality . Their words affect their overall personal vibratory energy. The Indian yogis have long honored and worshipped the sound god.401 In ancient meditations extinct Sanskrit words are still practiced today , because of the power of sound and vibration that they contain. The Hindus and seers of the Semantic races also assigned great importance to the word. The sacred word was esteemed in the Jewish religion. Some words were so sacred tha t their usage was restricted. Islam contains a doctrine of the mystical word. The Zoroastrians, who had their religion long before Buddha and the Christ, always preserved their sacred words.402 Many ancient traditions instructed disciples to chant the names of god and other powerful w ords for internal transformation and power. Although the actual word changes in these different traditions, the idea of sacred and uplifting energy contained within the word remains the same. We can attach similar energy to our words as well, creating inner transformation as well as affecting those who hear our sounds. Creation stories from many ancient and modern religions give sound and the spoken word an important role in the creation of the universe: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. John 1:1 (A spoken word is a sound.) Hindu tradition states in the Vedas, In the beginning was Brahman with whom was the Word. And the Word is Brahman. Thot, an Egyptian God, was believed to have created the world with his voice. According to Mayan tradition, in the Popul Vuh (the book on creation), humans are given life by the power of the Word. In the Hopi Indian tradition, Spider Woman sings songs of creation to produce animated life. 400 Khan, Inayat, Hazrat. The Music of Life . Omega Publishing: New Lebanon, N.Y., 1983. pg. 234. 401 Worship of Nada Brahman by T.S. Parthasarathy. The real aim of Indian music has always been to attain self realization and through music ... this is achieved much sooner. http://svbf.org/journal/vol1no2/nada.pdf 402Khan, Inayat, Hazrat. The Music of Life , Omega Publishing: New Lebanon, N.Y., 1983. pg. 228. 258 The Satapatha Brahmana reads, In the beginning was God with power through speech. God said, May I be many...may I be propagated through subtle speech,' he united himself with that speech and became pregnant. In Chinese Buddhism, the Divine Voice calls forth the form of the universe. If God used sound or words to create heaven and earth, what are you creating with your voice? Perfecting the Energy of our Words What energy accompanies your words? Let's improve the energy that you send when you project your own name. In this exercise you will increase your consciousness of the messages and energy that you send to others when you introduce yourself. Most people are not aware that they tell others how they want to be treated, as they introduce themselves. What voice do you use when yo u say your name? Say your name several times and feel how it sounds. These questions will help analyze your unconscious messages: Do you love your name as it comes out of your mouth? What feeling do you project? What are the speed volume, pitch, and EQ when you say your name? Do you like how your name sounds? What is your posture, which affects your voice? Does the sound vibrate in the spine? It sounds richer, fuller, softer, lower and yet confident when it does. This also increases the volume of harmonic s in your voice. The voice sounds differently with the head tilted up or down. The pitch goes up when you lean your head up. When your scalp or forehead is tightened your voice rises in pitch and it slightly lowers as these muscles relax. Where does your n ame vibrate in your body? The head? The gut? The throat? Thoughts resonate in your head when you are in a thinking mode. When you have an emotional message the sound comes from your gut or heart . When the sound reverberates in your throat, you are projecti ng or reaching out to others. Say your name and notice changes in its pitch. Is there a change in the pitch at the end of your name? When the pitch goes up, you project a more positive feeling as if you are raising energy. When 259 the pitch dips at the end of your name, you project a sad feeling. When it lowers a tiny bit and is slower paced, it projects self- assured ness. What kind of melody do you project when you say your name? Do you say your name like a question, expressing uncertainty about who you are a nd what you want? Do you swallow your breath? Do you swallow the sound in your mouth, mumbling? What is it that you are holding back? If you imagine your name as a ball of colored air coming out of your mouth, does it shoot across the room? Only go severa l inches from your face? Or stay in your mouth? The energy of your voice can be aggressive or reach out to others. Is air going through your nose? This sound is less clear and does not projected well. The muffled sound reflects lack of confidence and clarity. With which ear are you listening to your name? Try hearing your name only with your right ear. Now cover your right ear and hear your name from your left ear. The sound appears more immediate and clear when you hear from your right ear. Your dictati on will also be clearer when you get in the habit of hearing from your right ear. When you breathe, how deep is your breath? Before you say your name do you take a shallow breath or a deep one? Try taking a deep breath so that the air goes to your lower belly and hear the subtle sounds of your name change, as it becomes more rooted, confident and self -assured. Finally, relax your lower gut, as if it were falling onto the floor, and then take a breath. Your words now reflect a deeper conviction. Ancient Hi ndi texts describe benefits of certain vowels: E denotes a feminine quality of grace, wisdom, beauty and receptivity. O and U have a masculine quality of power and expression. A has the perfection of both qualities. What vowels are in your name? The mystic Sufis have also studied the impact of vowel sounds. They suggest that Ah represents the feeling of unity, opens your heart energy and radiates energy. Ooo (sounds like cool) relaxes and draws energy inward. Eee relates to mental energy. Hmm vibrates the t op of your head and connects you to your higher spirit. Oh (as in go) combines ah and oo, which effects the endocrine system. Are any of these sounds found in your name? What does our voice tell others about how we want to be treated? We readily believe o thers are independent and autonomous; but 260 subconsciously they are affected by our messages. People respond to the qualities of our voice. Sharry says, People treat you the way you train them.403 We exchange feelings and energies with words, making our voic e a bridge. People react to the subtle energy we send out on words... energy that we may not be aware of. We can increase our aware ness of our deeper messages and control them. Exercise: Voices We Like Another method to develop our voice is to study the voices of people we admire. Keep a list of attractive v oices. We benefit from simply copying voices that we like. Within our favorite voices are energy and qualities that we desire. There is a reason why we are attracted to certain music, sounds and voice s. We are seeking energies that we need to maintain our inner harmony and balance. These attributes are within our grasp waiting to be discovered, developed and expressed in our own voice! For example, I like Sean Connery's voice. It is solid and strong, yet gentle. I sense patience and und erstanding with his voice. It has a slower pace than mine, with more bass tones. I sense that it is not easily swayed. There are some qualities in that voice that I want. I desire a steady and gentle strength that comfo rtably stands its ground. I am too quick to please others. My personal adaptations to the sound of my voice would be to add more bass tones and slow down its pace. Mimicking the sounds of Sean Connery's voice enables me to harmonize my own energy, while d eveloping desired attribute s. In summary, we can analyze voices for good qualities and practice these attributes by changing our voices. All change does not come from exerting our will power. Sometimes it comes from a change in energy, which can be readil y achieved by changing our voice. Exercise: Voices We Do N ot Like A person's voice contains a wealth of information that we can instantly access. We can access the body's energies and messages, even ones that are subconscious. Hazrat In ayat Khan tells us, There 403 Edwards, Sharry. The Making of a Soul, Sound Health: Albany, OH., 1988. pg. 20. 261 is a sense within us that can understand language' spoken without words.404 We can quickly interpret information that is carried on voices. We receive warnings when we hear unpleasant qualities in people's voices. Here are a few voices that I do not like : Demanding voices have energy that projects out. It has a jabbing effect and it swirls to the right. Whining voices rotate counter clockwise and suck in energy. A boring voice never slips down to the solar plexus. It resonates only from the upper part of the body as if the person has no feeling in his words. He feels disconnected from his words. The manipulative voice has a sweetness that lacks fullness and deep tones. The rhythm is compelling. The loud voice attempts to control you. The soft muffled voice sucks your attention and energy in. We can develop our ability to hear unspoken words. Just paying close attention to subtle inflections increases our understanding of what people do not say. Most of what people say is in between the word s. Many conversations are superficial; while the underlying emotional content is revealing. With training you can hear when someone is not telling the truth no r wholly committed to his words. When people are not in their truth: The flow of breath change s. They almost hold their breath through a lie. There is less distance between the pitches in different words. These words are planned, flat and calculated. People do not project their words freely, as if the words hide in the back of their mouths. Each person has a distinctive voice when lying. Get someone to say a few lies in fun and notice the subtleties in his voice. When these subtleties surface again, expect less than the truth! It is easier to notice a liar than to acknowledge our own lack of truthfulness. Unconsciously , we hang on to ideas that are not true for 404 Khan, Inayat, Hazrat. The Music of Life , Omega Publishing: New Lebanon, N.Y., 1983. pg. 146. 262 us. People tell us what is in our best interest and we mold ourselves into what other people expect. W e assume other people's beliefs without being aware that their advice does not ring true for us. We are taught to be polite, avoid confrontation and to be pleasing. Should's , ought -to's and politically correct behavior influence and define us. We censor our honest words, not admitting things we dislike. We unknowingly push uncomfortabl e feelings into our subconscious mind, which has a n invisible hold on us. We do not want others to know our deep feelings. We are different on the inside, than what we show others. Think about revealing your secrets to your mother-in-law, priest, competito rs or boss. People maintain appearances by using insincere words that are in opposition to what they are feeling. They change their words to fit in. By saying one thing and meaning another, they unconsciously create internal tension and negative subtle e nergy . When people are fully honest they release stored, negative emotional energy. The truth sets them free. One of the difficulties of speaking words that reflect the depth of who we are is that it is difficult to know ourselves ! We can use our own voice to investigate our hidden subconscious feelings by listening to its subtle qualities. How does our voice change when we are not committed to our words? How is our voice different when we are polite, but not honest? Try the short exercise below: Try saying I don't care when you do. Pay attention to your voice qualities. When you hear these qualities, your voice and gut feelings are out of alignment. Now say that you do not care about something, when you truly don't. Notice the difference between th e two voices. Pretend you are a movie star and you are acting. Now say, I do not care when you do. While acting one can say things that are not true, with close to a normal speaking voice. When pretending to be someone else, you disconnect your words and personal subconscious messages. 263 Suppressed emotions can surprise us, revealing clues about the invisible , emotional baggage we store. By recognizing our truth on deeper levels we grow. Exercise: Chakra Energy in the Voice Chakras (derived from a Sanskrit word that translates as wheel , disc or turning) refer to wheel -like vortices, which receive, assimilate and express subtle life force energy . Author and sound healer Nicole LaVoie describes the function of a chakra. The cha kras, or energy centers, are the conduit of life force from our I AM Source or Divine Energy. This life -force energy moves at a very high speed and must reduce its vibrational rate in order to merg e with the cells of our body. These electrical impulses are transformed into chemicals upon entering the different glands. This Divine Energy first enters the chakra, and then goes through the energy channels of the nervous system and the endocrine system. The endocrine system uses the various hormones to send energy to the blood stream and to all the cells in the body.405 The cha kras have been said to interact with the body's ductless endocrine glands and lymphatic system by feeding in good bioenergies and disposing of unwanted bioenergies. Seven major chakras are located within a person's subtle energy body . Six of these major wheels are stacked in a column of energy that spans from the base of the spine to the middle of t he forehead and correspond with states of consciousness. The seventh chakra, located on the top of the head, receives spiritual energy. Different emotions and energies are generated when we direct our sounds to each chakra. This energy is reflected in ou r voice when we direct our attention to these areas. Try this simple exercise. Start talking and do not stop until the exercise is over. You can say, Blah, blah, and blah if you want. Stretch both arms straight out in front of you, parallel to the groun d. Twist your arms so that your palms face outwards. One palm faces to the right, while the other points to the left. Keep your palms facing the same direction and cross your arms so that your palms now face 405 LaVoie, Nichole. Return to Harmony: Creating Harmony and Balance through the Frequencies of Sound, Sound Energy Press: Pagosa Springs, CO., 1996. pgs. 78 -79. 264 each other. Clasp your hands, your palms are tou ching. Put the fingers of one hand in -between the fingers of the other hand. Pull your elbows out and swing your hands down. Rotate them inward until your hands are close to your face. Good! Listen to your voice change. As you do this exercise your voice utilizes energy from your root chakra. The pitch lowers and the sound becomes fuller. With root chakra energy in your voice it is more difficult to push you, as you better stand your ground. Our chakra energy is reflected in our voice when we direct our attention to the chakra. For example, you can speak from your heart. Try it! Imagine your voice located in your heart. That's all you have to do! Notice that the tones in your voice are lower than when you imagine your sound coming from your head. Experimen t with locating your voice in each one of the major chakras and listen to your voice change. Tailbone. Projecting sound to your tailbone produces a rooting and grounding feeling. Your voice echoes in this area of y our body when you stand up for yourself . It is difficult to abuse a person whose sound resonating in this spot. They sound too strong to mess with! In contrast, when a person is frightened, the tones resonate higher up in the body. Sacral area. Sound resonating in our gut (three to five inches below our navel) carries our passions and emotions. Sexual, emotiona l and balance issues are connected to this chakra. Solar plexus. Sounds filling the area of our solar plexus chakra (three to five inches above our navel) resound with confidence and an e mpowered sense of self worth. Personal power is employed in this chakra. Heart. Sounds from our heart radiate love. Love energy and feelings about relationships vibrate in this area. Compassion and forgiveness are rooted here. Throat. The tones from our t hroat project to accommodate a large audience, reflecting clarity and self -expression. Third Eye. The thoughts from this spot between our two eyebrows create a dreamy, intuitive feeling. Intuition and wisdom resonate here. Crown of our Head. The thoughts vibrating in the top of our head create a holy feeling. We can feel our voice resonate here by acting selflessly and spiritually. 265 Change Yourself with Your Voice It is difficult to make a personal change using will power alone. That is why so many New Year's resolutions fail. We can change our essence quickly and effectively by altering our voice. We can change the pitches and rhythms that the body hears every time we speak. Changing our voice enables us t o transmute our negative feelings, learn emotion al lessons and make personal changes easier. Hazrat In ayat Khan reminds us, Healing that comes through a change of mind or feeling, instigated by personal will, simply does not have the sustaining power to be permanent or complete. True healing requires the transformational ability of sound. 406 Few people realize that they can change their life force with sound! Khan gives us more insight, One need not be a singer, but every person should give some part of his day, even the shortest time, five or ten or fifteen minutes, to the development of his voice.407 Hazrat Inayat Khan comments, The fortunate person has a different voice than the one who is not so fortunate. If you gather five people who have proved to be very fortunate and listen to their voices , you will find how great the difference is between their voices and the ordinary. When you compare the voices of great people, regardless of their occupations, with the voices of others, you will find there is a difference.408 Khan concludes, From the vo ice, you can determine the stage of a person's particular evolution. You do not need to see him; just his voice will tell you how far he has evolved. There is no doubt that the character of a person is evident in his voice. At every stage, infancy, childho od, young adult and more advanced aged, the pitch of the voice changes. Advanced age is a culmination of what a person has gained throughout a lifetime and the voice is indicative of this attainment. As with everything else in life, there comes a change in the voice with every step of spiritual evolution.409 406Sikh Guru Nanak, pg. 143. 407 Khan, Inayat, Hazrat.

Scientists have discovered how radio waves go through space , but not how radio waves interact with p eople . Someday , scientists will learn that which mystics have known for thousands of years. Man is an instrument.410 Let's pretend we are an instrument, such as a piano. McTaggart suggests, Think of your brain as a piano. When we observe something in the world, certain portions of the brain resonate at certain frequencies. At any point of attention, our brains only posses certain notes, which trigger certain strings of length and frequency. This information is then picked up by ordinary electrochemical circuits of the brain, just as the vibrations of the strings eventually resonate through the entire piano.411 At its core a piano is comprised of musical strings. In our visualization of being a piano every person we encounter plucks our strings, some makin g harmonious sounds and others creating discord and disruption. Not only people, but sunspots, weather, animals and energy from various locations strike subtle chords within. What control does the piano have over the songs when someone else plays it? Lik ewise, what control do we have over our song, the music of our soul , when so much in our world plays us? The same song sounds different on various pianos. Some pianos are out of tune. One has a brilliant sound, yet another sounds muffled. Some are mell ow and others are flat. Often keys stick, playing when they should not. A cheap piano squeaks and thumps when a pedal is 410 Khan, Hazrat, Inayat, The Music of Life , Omega Publishing: New Lebanon, N.Y., 1983, pg. 251. 411 McTaggart, Lynne. The Field, The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, Harper Collins Publishing: New York, 2002. Pg. 84. 267 pushed. The quality of the piano makes a huge difference in the tone and atmosphere of a song. Other people may strike a musical note within ourselves, on our pianos in this illustration, but we can harmonize these sounds, transforming them into lifting music, just like a gor geous piano makes a piano performer sound better. If our positive emotions are strong enough, they will subtly ove rcome negative emotions of others.412 We can be a force that plays others, more so than they play us! We c an delight in the song of life and our soul sings with purpose, beauty, love and power! 412 Entrainment is a natural phenomenon that causes brainwave frequenc ies to copy external frequencies, which correspond to brain -states (for examp le, to induce sleep). In essence, the stronger vibration overcomes the lesser. 268 Appendix A The Healing Flower Symphoni es The Chicory Flower: The Motherliness Flower From Demanding Love to Giving Love Freely\"413 The chicory flower song helps those who are overly cautious for children, relatives and friends. These people smugly correct what they consider wrong. They al so require that those they love be near them.414 The chicory melody crescendos from a seductive and demanding beat, as if it was singing, This is what I'll do for you, when you do what I want you to! The chicory personality seeks to control someone, t o insure he does what the chicory person perceives is right. The unchanging seductive and rigid beat in this song endures while the melody frees itself from the chains of the control of the rhythm. The feeling of demanding energy is replaced by the f eeling of enjoyment. The continual seductive beat surprises us, similar to the wonderful feeling one gets when one stops controlling people and loves them unconditionally. This new type of love produces a beautiful peace, not possible with the energy of co ntrol. \"The Cerato Flower: The Intuition Flower From Indecisiveness to Inner Certainty\"415 The cerato flower helps those who lack confidence in making decisions. Constantly seeking advice, these people are often misguided.416 The symphony builds to a peak that is never culminated...as the melodic line changes its direction and rethinks the melody line again and again without any conclusions. This lack of knowing what to do or decisiveness builds pressure. Worry clouds the music until it discovers a s imple and happy knowing of what to do. \"Agrimony: The Honesty Flower From Pretended Harmony to Inner Peace417 The vibration of the agrimony flower uplifts people who love peace and are distressed by argument. To avoid confrontation, these people sacr ifice too much. They feel tormented, compromised, restless and worried, while they hide their negative feelings.418 413 Mechthild and Scheffer.

Healing Arts Press: Rochester, Vermont, 2001. pg. 44. 269 A beautiful harmony is presented in the agrimony music, but the after - vibes of the notes are bent out of tune. The lovely melody leaves a bad taste in the mouth, just as inner turmoil builds with lack of emotional integrity. The soul flower symphony then raises its vibration into pure and absolute harmony, creating the transparent and deep emotions of peace. \"Centaury: The Service Flower From Passive Service to Active Service\"419 The centaury song blesses those who are k ind, quiet and gentle, but anxious to serve others. People on this path overtax themselves, becoming more like servants than willing helpers. Due to their good nature th ey do more than their share of work, neglecting their own mission in life.420 The centaury melody sounds like a ballerina dancing on a music box. She twirls and delights people as she goes round and round in her prescribed path. She is beautiful, yet me chanical, repeating what movements are expected. The dance of the music box ballerina then unravels and freely flows, as if the chords ascend into light. \"Vervian: The Enthusiasm Flower From World Savior to Light Bearer\"421 The vervian flower music upl ifts inflexible people with fixed principles who are c onfident they are right. People who benefit from this melody try to convert others to their views. They are strong willed due to their convictions.422 The symphony dances to a fixed rhythm; its melod ies relentlessly following the established drum beat. Diverting from rigid and stylistic music, the melody breaks free. Eventually each note becomes diffuse d, like colors swirling into a translucent white light. With no desire to control or be controlled, the melody sings itself free. \"Water Violet: The Communication Flower From Isolation to Togetherness\"423 The essence of the water violet song caresses people who like to be alone, even if they are ill. People learning the lesson of the water violet spe ak gently and move little. Being independent, clever, capable and self reliant, they are almost free of the opinion of others. However, being aloof, they go 419 Mechthild and Scheffer. Encyclopedia of Bach Flower Remedies .

This is unfortunate, as their peace and c almness are blessings to those around them.424 Delicate and isolated tones paint a translucent color -wash on a canvas. As the song progresses the single melody finds companio n notes that it softly intertwines with. The melodies dance together, but don't exert control. The feeling of isolation becomes lessened and transposes into an ethereal sound as it glistens and swirls into bliss with the company of other tones. \"Impatiens: The Time Flower From Impatience to Patience\"425 The energy of the impatien s flower soothes those who want things done immediately. The se people push others to make them quicker or they work alone.426 The melody tosses and turns, while it searches for quick resolutions. Invariably, obstacles in the melody provide delay and fru stration. Likewise, the negative energy of impatience surfaces when one wants everything done right now. In the music the feeling of impatience is transformed into peace, accepta nce and a calm rhythm of breath. \"Minimus: The Bravery Flower From Fear of th e World to Trust in the World\"427 This song is for those with fears of illness, pain, accidents, poverty, loneliness and misfortunes. Fear haunts people with minimus flower energy, as they quietly bear their dread.428 Creepy and overwhelming fear rip s through the music with a scary hiss. The nasty music finds an unexpected sense of knowing... a sense of well - being that lies beneath a feeling of trust. Knowing, a foundation that supports the feeling of trust, is represented by the literal sound of a hear tbeat. Trust and the melody are built upon the consistent and enduring beat of the heart. \"Clematis: The Reality Flower From Escaping Reality to Living in Reality\"429 This healing flower symphony gives relief to those who are dreamy, drowsy, not -fully -awake and who show no interest in life. These quiet people are dissatisfied, living more in the future than in the present.430 424 A quote from Edward Bach by Mechthild and Scheffer. Encyclopedia of Bach Flower Remedies .

As the song continues, the warmth of the sun beckons the soul to awaken, to see more clearly and dance in the glory of the fully awakened light and with clear melodic tones. \"Gentian: The Belief Flower From Doubt to Trust\"431 The gentian flower has special gifts for easily discouraged people. Any small delay causes doubt and disheartens them. Doubt transforms into the energy of faith and overcomes obstacles.432 The frantic struggle and scurry of the music anticipates Murphy's Law: Any thing that can go wrong will! While f ocusing on potential problems, the melody worries, as it is never satisfied with any answers. The steady frustration from struggles and the emotion of doubt are later replaced by a sense of knowing that things will w ork out for the best. A steady ah sound underlines the conclusion of the Gentian melody. The ah sound is said to be associated with the heart, love and compassion. The ah sound is found in the words Ma and Pa. The same sound is in the name o f many gods and goddesses, such as Jesuah (Jesus), Muhammad, Buddha and Krishna. An open heart easily allows the energy of trust to enter in. \"Scleranthus: The Balance Flower From Inner Conflict to Inner Equilibrium\"433 Those who can't make up their min ds are relieved with the energetic power of the scleranthus flower. These indecisive people are usually quiet and bear their difficulties alone.434 The music goes this way and that, mulling over the negative sides of options. Despair and tension arise f rom the lack of confidence that any decision will not produce the desired results. The song eases into the feeling of confidence, like the feeling you get when you know you are doing the right thing. Repeated experiences of knowing create feelings of pea ce and inner balance, leaving the feelings of isolation and dread behind. \"Rock Rose: The Liberation Flower From Panic to Heroic Courage\"435 The rock rose soul type lives mutely under intense pressure of fear.436 430 A quote from Edward Bach by Mechthild and Scheffer.

Eventually, a sobering resolve is birthed; one can overcome any obstacle. Determination and power increase as the momentum of energy builds and lifts the listener into emoti onal space of courage.

Appendix B The Suppression of Ancient Harmonic Science By Richard Merrick Quoted from www.harmonicinterferencetheory.com Through the power of guilt, fear, torture and war against pagan influences from the Middle East, the medieval Church struggled to bring under hand a violent and turbulent Europe. The last thing the Church needed was a resurgence of Egyptian Hermeticism, Hebrew Kabbalah or neo - Pythagoreanism to interfere with its plan. Such pagan harmonic theosophies were a clear and present danger to the Church and its project of social control. Harmo nic ideals, often represented by the Pythagorean pentagram or Hebrew hexagram, were cast by the Church as evil pagan symbols and associated with satanic worship, witchcraft and occult rituals. Those who studied harmonic properties in numbers, geomet ry and astronomy, such as the Dualist and Gnostic Cathars in southern Europe during the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries, were threatened, executed or exiled, forcing many to roam the countryside as 'gypsies' (a pejorative form of Egyptian). The Knights Templ ar, the primary keepers of the Egyptian temple mysteries, were then hunted down and murdered by the Church (on Friday 13, 1307 ) with a few fleeing to far -flung places like northern Scotland. In these remnants of the Egyptian mystery school were the seeds o f Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry and other 'secret societies' - all of which were founded on the study of harmonics in numbers and geometry. This said, few adherents today are the least bit aware or interested in harmonic science, opting instead for the benef its of a fraternal network of friends and the occasional community service project. But while an honest look at European history seemed to explain how and why harmonic principles had disappeared from Western religion, it still did not answer why sci ence, as the presumed pillar of empirical truth in the world, did not eventually return to harmonic science as a unifying field of study. So I dug a little deeper and here is what I found. 436 Barnard, Julian. Bach Flower Remedies: Form and Function. Lindisfarne Books; Great Barrington, MA., 2004. pg. 132. 273 The Anti -Harmonic C ampaign During the run up to The Enlig htenment in the late 17th and 18th centuries the 'scientific method' had actually been designed to discourage the study of harmonics and its corresponding natural philosophy known as musica universalis. In an age when music and harmonic theory was st rictly controlled by Church law, Galileo's inner conflict of faith together with his fear of the Inquisition gave us the unguided study of nature we now know as the scientific method. The old world view of musica universalis is soon shoved aside by Newton and Descartes, everything became nothing more than quirky machinations of discrete parts. In an Age of Reason , anything associated with music was viewed as a Church tradition while the study of harmonics was left behind as metaphysical roadkill on the road to The Enlightenment. \"I learned that the exclusion of music and pagan harmonic principles from modern science was first suggested in a letter from the astronomer Galileo to his daughter, apparently prompted by his inner conflict of faith and underst andable desire to avoid torture and imprisonment by the Italian Inquisition. Why? Why would such an evil be thought to exist in music, much less this particular interval? What should be so horribly offensive in dividing an octave in half (as the trit one does) that it should be singled out and banned from all Western sacred music through an elaborate set of canonical rules? Was this effort purely based on religious symbolism or was there really something dangerous in the tritone that could hurt us? Cou ld it negatively influence our hearts and minds, perhaps turning us toward evil? Many have speculated on this. Some say the tritone represents the Devil because it is a dissonant interval with an irreconcilable split ratio of 7:5 (augmented 4th) or 10:7 (diminished 5th) as found in meantone temperament. But dissonance cannot be the only reason. The tritone is not much (if any) more dissonant sounding than the intervals of a minor 2nd or major 7th and no one thinks they are devilish. They're not even naughty. Some say it was the Devil in music because the tritone is so close to the interval of a perfect 5th that two monks could too easily sing dissonantly as they tried to chant in pure parallel 5ths. But this cannot be the only reason because whe n they sang out of tune anywhere else, those wrong intervals weren't the Devil. They were just out of tune. An April 2006 article in BBC News Magazine quotes Bob Ezrin, a former business associate of mine and music producer of rock bands like Pink Flo yd, KISS and Alice Cooper, as saying: It apparently was the sound used to call up the beast. There is something very sexual about the tritone'. While walking the streets of London some years back, Bob and I had discussed this subject and conjectu red that the symmetric contraction of the 274 tritone must have been taken as a symbol of symmetry in the human body and thereby sexuality and carnal knowledge. At the time, this was the only reason I could imagine for its exclusion from the Church and avoidan ce in music theory. There were no other psychological or physiological studies I knew that suggested the tritone was some kind of harmonic Viagra to enhance feelings of sexuality. But even if this were found to be the case, surely the procreative act shoul d be considered a beautiful spiritual experience! Probably the most common reason given for the evil reputation of the tritone is its connection to the number 666', the Number of the Beast referenced in the Biblical Book of Revelation. The importan ce of this number appears to have originated in the ancient Hebrew practice of gematria, or number geometry known today as numerology, where the tritone's 3 wholetones (the Devil's Trident perhaps) spanning 6 semitones could have suggested three consecutiv e sixes. A more likely gematria theory correlates to the number 216 as the ancient Hebrew symbol for God. It was believed that finding the missing code for this number would bring about the return of the Hebrew Satan in a final showdown, thus trigge ring a Messianic Age of peace. Not coincidentally, the cube root of 216 is six, or 6\u00d76\u00d76. Perhaps the missing code for the Hebrew Satan was once associated with the tritone. Similarly, when 6 tritones, each composed of 6 semitones, are stacked over 3 octaves it surrounds the pentagonal cycle of perfect 5ths with a triple hexagonal cycle of tritones, or 666. In the end, it seems to make little difference which theory we choose to accept because alignments with the old Beast of Christianity pops up eve rywhere we look. As we shall see later, these sixes are neither coincidences nor silly mysterious numerological symbolisms, but are in fact numerical proportions related to the physics of highly resonant vibration. Still, the speculation surrounding the tr itone continues because nowhere in the mountains of religious or scientific literature will you find it taken seriously and explained as a natural property of acoustics. In the final analysis, the most likely justification for the tritone's evil reputation arrives to us from the harmonically inspired mythology of the Greeks and the error Pythagoras found in the irreconcilable schisma at mid-octave. This error, intertwined with the pentagram, golden ratio and Devil's interval were nothing less than the Biblical forbidden fruit with the tritone itself an audible version of original sin.' Yet even when we disregard religious and numeric symbolism there remains a real sensation of tension in the tritone and an anticipated tendency for it to automat ically spring closed. We don't really need religious symbolisms and stories to see how the priests could have concluded that something demonic was involved. At a time of deep mysticism and belief in satanic forces, the tritone was probably seen as some kin d of daemonic planchette, sliding along a musical Quija board under its own supernatural power. 275 Far more than just a musical concept, the tritone offers us a window into the collective psyche, touching on our concept of God and belief in good and evil. Like an anthropological microscope equipped with a musical lens, the tritone allows us to see inside a society shaped by the Roman Catholic Church. Indeed, it brings into focus a world still largely under the influence of its anti -pagan, anti -harmonic d octrine. As for me, I'm going to listen to a little Bach, enjoy the musical universe we live in and do my part to try and change things for the better. This is my new unapproved harmonic worldview. 276 Jill Mattson: Artist, Composer, Musician, Researcher and Author Jill Mattson is an accomplished Artist, Musician and Author who brings her deep spiritualism and intense curiosity and wonder to the many creat ive passions that she pursues.
