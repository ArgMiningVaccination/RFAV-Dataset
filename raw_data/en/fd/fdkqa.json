In an effort to provide survivors of intimate partner violence with traditional healing modalities, our Red Women Rising Resource Directory includes connections to a statewide circle of traditional healers. Our circle of traditional healers provide a safe and supportive space to attain traditional medicine and ceremonies for survivors on their healing journey. Each traditional healer understands the experience of survivors, and provides a spiritual/trauma informed approach to healing. Our list concludes a wide-range of traditional healers, from local California tribes, as well as other traditional healers from other regions and practice across Turtle Island. Understanding each survivors needs and traditions are different, some of our traditional modalities for healing include: Bear Dance Ceremonies Sweat Lodge Native American Church Tepee Meetings Round House Ceremonies Curanderismo Drumming Dance Medicine Gathering "}
