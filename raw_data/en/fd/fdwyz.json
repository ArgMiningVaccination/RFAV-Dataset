A toxin is something that can cause you or your pet to become ill. They can have varying degrees of severity from something mildly toxic to deadly, to toxins that slowly build up over time, to those that can happen quickly. Although we may think we live in a cleaner environment than before sadly more animals are suffering from varying degrees of intoxication. [We've compiled a list, some you're probably aware of such as certain foods that are toxic and dangerous for cats and dogs to poisonous plants](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/your-pets-dirty-dozen) but it's the slow and deadly toxins that build up over time that most people are totally unaware off. The intoxication happens ever so gradually that most pet owners don't realise something is wrong until it's too late. With the rise of illnesses in animals such as [cancer](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/cancer-dogs-cats), [autoimmune diseases](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/auto-immune-diseases-in-pets), [pancreatic disease](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/pancreas-cats-dogs), [allergies](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/itchiness-food-allergies-anal-gland-problems), it's important for you as your pet's guardian to help them live in a healthy environment. One way of doing that is to eliminate or limit their exposure to as many toxic things as possible that could cause harm both in the short and long term. Toxicity is not just limited to the ingestion of something poisonous but it's also how toxic things effect you're pet's mental, emotional and spiritual well-being. Just like humans, animals can become physically, emotionally and mentally unwell through toxic exposure. These 5 groups of toxic things slowly poison cats and dogs and are dangerous to the long term health of your pet. Cats and dog's metabolise things differently from humans, absorb energy differently and are connected to life force differently. These might seem like irrelevant things to us mere humans, but for your cat and dog they are fundamental influences in what is toxic to dogs and cats. When the toxins slowly chip away at these three elements your dog or cat's defences weaken and oftentimes cause irreversible damage. Environmental toxins for your cat and dog can be found within your home through to their hunting territory or walking territory. You can't always influence what your cat or dog comes across when they are out and about, but some of the worst slow and potentially dangerous toxins that are long term disrupters to your pet's health are found in your home and that you can influence and control. Consistent over exposure to these chemical based products can often have both a short term and long term impact on your cat and dog's immune system, liver and kidneys or can be the catalyst for free radicals, the foundation for [cancers](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/cancer-dogs-cats). Try to reduce the number of products you use or even better, stop using them altogether or find eco-friendly and pet-friendly alternatives. To put this into perspective you have 5 million smelling receptors, a cat has 200 million and a dog has 300 million so one tiny drop inhaled repeatedly overtime can potentially wipe out your cat or dog or slowly destroy metabolic processes in your pet. There are certain foods that are seriously toxic for both cats and dogs mainly chocolate, avocado pip, macadamia nuts, grapes, tomatoes, onions etc. But what most pet owners don't understand is that kibbles are directly related to the majority of long term illnesses and toxicity in pets.

Through all the marketing blurb we've been wrongly lead to believe that real food is dangerous, that [raw bones](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/raw-bones-dogs-cats) are toxic, that animals living in the home aren't the same as animals living in the wild. Any pet owner whose cat or dog has more outside access, have all seen the results of their normal gentle tame house cat come home with a bird or mice or their dog trying to take off after a rabbit, hen, duck etc. Your dog and cat still to this day in 2020, have an ancestral digestive ecosystem. Throughout the whole of evolution Mother Nature has not changed that, nor has she given any animal the ability to cook. The entire animal kingdom throughout all the years on the planet has and continues to eat, raw food. [Click here to read the top myths about raw feeding your pet](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/raw-feeding-myths). Feeding your pet's digestive system correctly is imperative for the functioning of your pet's blood, organs, brain, growth and systems, including the immune and [lymphatic system](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/why-your-dog-s-lymphatic-system-is-important). Cat's and dog's need real food and feeding unnatural and processed diet causes a whole host of ill health such as [behavioural the type of food you feed your cat and dog is so fundamental to their way of being it's known that poor diets such as [processed or cooked food negatively impact gene mutation in your cat or dog.](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/phenotype-and-genotype-cats-dogs.) Also many pet food companies use [GMO ingredients](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/gmo-pet-food) which are found to cause cancer and are responsible for chronic diseases in our pets. Pet's are suffering long term ill health with [cooked or processed foods](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/heating-or-cooking-food-kills-off-nutrition). Everything about this type of food is geared for long digestion time - the total reverse of how your cat and dog's bodies are designed to cope with digestion, which is fast and rapid! Raw feeding is normal and inline with the structure of your pet's stomach and intestinal system. Your pet has highly acidic digestive juices in the stomach working on breaking down the food, quickly absorbing the nutrition and then, quickly eliminating any waste. Feeding your pet cooked or processed means it sits in their stomach for upto 15 hours which starts a massive domino chain reaction of negative effects. Starting with, the [negative bacteria having time to build up](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/mitochondria). This seemingly small and insignificant action puts all your pet's organs into a situation of stress, starting with the pancreas. Also look at the quality of your pet's drinking water. As more chemicals and minerals are added to the water from our taps, they impact your cats and dog's long term health. If you've got a water filter in your home, start filling your pet's water with this water instead of normal tap water. \"There is NO chronic disease, no autoimmune disease and certainly no cancer or other chronic condition in your pet that would not benefit from being \"fed out of disease\", via feeding your pet a BARF or real fresh food diet. I tell my clients that feeding raw whole foods is the best way to detox cats, dog and even for us. Basically the consumption of un-real food such as kibbles means the body misses out on the opportunity to use real food for the correct metabolic pathways\". Dr Patricia Jordan. [Click here to see the conditions raw feeding can treat.](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/conditions-barf-treats) \"Raw food aids digestion and the immune system views the raw food as friendly and the cooked food as dangerous. This causes a defense reaction by white blood cells\" Dr Paul Kouchakoff clincal chemist in Switzerland and specialist in Digestive Leukocytosis. You might have thought this was limited to just humans but more pets are suffering from stress, emotional traumas and other mental illnesses such [ depression](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/causes-of-depression-in-your-cat-and-dog) and [ anxiety](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/separation-anxiety-in-your-cat-or-dog). Sadly it's normally the result of their home environment and the energy of the people they share their home with. Through the study of quantum physics we know that humans and animals have energy fields around them and animals are actually vibrating at a higher energetic frequency than humans. In fact an animal's energy field is generally 10 times greater than a humans. Pets are so highly in tune with the environment around them that their whiskers are sensory receptors that allow them to understand the world around them and are super sensitive to things like changes in airflow and vibrations. The [chakras](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/pet-chakras) located in the pads of their paws, and at the base of their ears allow your pet to ground itself and pick up on the energies from the earth, such as changes in the weather, thunderstorms rolling in etc. and they form part of their primary receptors for their natural survival instinct. How does this effect you and them? Simply put, the energy you emit out, is magnetically attaching to your pet and vice versa. Something as simple as [your words and mood will effect their energy](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/communicating-with-your-cat-or-dog). Added to this, studies have shown that animals can intuitively pick up on your thoughts and absorb their energy too. We are all made up of energy. Our bodies produce and generate energy as a result of chemical and electrical processes that occur at a cellular level. This energy can become unstable, erratic, stagnant or depleted due to physical, emotional, dietary or spiritual imbalances. \"The huge difference between humans and animals is that animals have an unique system for living in balance and harmony with the planet and your pet will feel an innate need to help bring you into a energetic frequency of grounding and stability\". [Alecia Evans, animal communicator and healer](https://www.animalheeler.com/index.php) It's your energy the your pet is absorbing. If there are tensions at home, you're nervous, anxious or in a stressed state your cat or dog will absorb the energy and feel the need to calm you down, which becomes a vicious circle for your pet. \"When animals aren't living in environments that are in tune with their natural state of being they begin to develop wellness and health issues. Your cat and dog's cells are affected by every experience they have as well as creating an effect within the body. It's so deep rooted in their bodies that your pet's cells seek [ \"homeostatic regulation\"](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/your-dogs-behavior) and are constantly striving to feel or return to a sense of peace, which provides them with balance, healing and rest. As such, cells are seeking one sensation - peace, happiness and joy. These biochemical sensations tell these cells (and the whole body) that everything is safe and well\". [Dr Isla Fishburn ](https://kachinacanine.com/) Your dog and cat will thrive when everything is in balance - homeostasis and it's an important aspect in your cat and dog's wellness. When physical, mental and emotional stressors exceed the body's ability to cope, imbalances begin and if your pet's body is constantly trying to catch up because they are trying to harmonise your energy or the energy in the home, it will deplete your cat and dog's resources, energy and balance to the point they become emotionally and physically unwell. To optimise your cat's and dog's wellness, their WHOLE body needs to feel a sense of peace, as it's a vital part of homeostatic regulation. Simple ways to help your pet are through meditations, [ acupuncture](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/acupuncture-for-pets), EFT, [chakra healing](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/pet-chakras) or [reiki ](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/reiki-for-cats)as these will all help rebalance the energies of your pet's body and bring your cat and dog's body back into alignment to allow energy to flow naturally and correctly, \"Animals are as complex as we are with intelligence and spiritual awareness and this not only applies to animals but is running through every form of life on the earth, as nature is sentient\". Martha Williams. 1) \"The actual duration of immunity of vaccines for pets is a lifetime. Once your pet has been immunized, it's good for a lifetime and repeating vaccines increases the chances of adverse effects like cancer happening\" [Dr Pat Jordan](https://dr-jordan.com/) and veterinary immunologist Dr Ronald Schultz. 2) \"Re-vaccinating an animal with existing vaccine immunity makes no difference at all to the immune status of the animal. i.e. the animal's immune system mops up the vaccine before it can 'boost' the immune system. I believe most booster vaccinations for cats and dogs are, at best useless, and at worst may contribute to immunologic disease including auto-immune disease, food hypersensitivities and atopic dermatitis and other itching skin diseases\". [Dr Nick Thompson](https://holisticvet.co.uk/) Cats and dogs are still today being pushed to have boosters or annual vaccinations that are unnecessary and are in fact exposing your pet to more toxins long term. There is a big difference between protecting pets with the core vaccines required when they are young to [over vaccinating](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/are-vaccinations-destroying-our-pets-health) adult pets to the point of destroying their health, especially considering that once immunized, your pet is good for life. Equally shocking stories of where pet owners are being told they have to 're-start' vaccines if you are late for annual vaccinations 'is inconsistent with fundamental immune system function and the principles of immunological memory'. [WSAVA](https://wsava.org/). Vaccinations stimulate the immune system and many holistic veterinarians believe that giving unnecessary vaccinations can contribute to auto-immune disease such as long standing allergic skin and gut problems, even cancer. Many studies link the aluminum adjuvant in vaccines to the cancers that are seen at the area of vaccination administration. Added to this, the aluminum in the vaccinations has a higher carcinogen grade than UV light and the macrophages,- types of immune cells within the body, have also been found to absorb this aluminum taking it to other areas of the body in attempt to rid the body of this toxic foreign invader. Stop over-vaccinating your cat and dog. Once it's done, it's done and if you're worried then a better route for your pet is titer testing which should give you peace of mind rather than blindly re vaccinating your pet and increasing their exposure to carcinogens.
