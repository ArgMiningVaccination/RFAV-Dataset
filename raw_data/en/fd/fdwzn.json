Integrative medicine is an approach to health that delivers results. It means providing cutting-edge treatments with traditional medical practices to deliver the most effective patient care. What is the Benefit? You are a person--not just symptoms, a disorder, or labs. We recognize this. A personalized focus means that your individualized treatment considers every aspect of your health. In addition to treating your primary concern, we improve your overall health, which includes your sleep, energy, digestion, and more. Is naturopathic medicine cost-effective? Absolutely! We strive to resolve your illness and provide vibrant health. The long-term goal is to reduce your medical spending. This allows you to enjoy life and be more productive, without wasting time in a waiting room. Will you work with my other health care providers? Yes! If you have an additional health care practitioner, please bring contact information and copies of any recent lab work. If I am currently taking prescription medications, can I still take natural medicines? It depends on your specific condition, medication and natural medicine. The provider is trained extensively in pharmaceutical drugs and their interactions with herbs and nutrients. This includes potential adverse events that could occur with improperly combined drugs, herbs, and nutrients. It is extremely important that you bring a list of all your medications and supplements for the safest and most effective treatment. How are a naturopathic and conventional doctor similar? Naturopathic doctors, like allopathic or osteopathic physicians, hold a four-year undergraduate degree as well as an additional four-year doctorate degree. In addition to a standard medical curriculum (anatomy, physiology, pathology, microbiology, immunology, clinical and physical diagnosis, laboratory diagnosis, cardiology, gastroenterology, gynecology, pharmacology, etc.), naturopathic doctors are required to complete extensive training in clinical nutrition, acupuncture, botanical medicine, hydrotherapy, naturopathic manipulative therapy, psychology, and counseling. They must complete at least two years of hands-on clinical training and pass two sets of national boards (board certified). Naturopathic doctors are trained to diagnose, treat or refer to specialists when necessary, much like your traditional primary care provider. Why do I need to see a naturopathic doctor if my symptoms are being managed with prescription medication? Symptoms are an expression of a body's ill health. When you are hot, you don't take a medication so that you no longer feel the heat, but that is how many drugs work. At KCIH, we investigate why you developed your illness and work to reverse the underlying cause. We do not simply cover the symptoms with a pill. Will insurance cover my visit? Insurance often can shape the treatment that you receive and the time you may spend with the provider. Instead, we are focused on providing the best care, without insurance influence. In the interest of keeping cash prices as low as possible, we do not bill insurance in the office. However, we are happy to provide you with a service summary with the proper diagnostic coding so that you can seek reimbursement after your visit, and we encourage you to submit. If reimbursement is vital to you, we recommend that you call your insurance providers prior to the visit. Can you order my labs? Yes, Naturopathic doctors are trained to draw blood, order lab work and interpret results in order to formulate an appropriate treatment. Naturopathic doctors can order many imaging studies such as X-rays, CT or MRI if they feel it is necessary to manage your condition. If you have had any recent lab work done, please bring all results to your visit. What can I expect From the Consultation? We offer a no-cost 15 minute consultation where you can meet the provider and we provide insight into what it looks like to work with a naturopathic doctor specific to your case. We will outline some short and long term goals and give insight into our care for you. What Should I Bring for the First Visit? The first visit is extensive. We review your entire health concern, as well as every other system in the body, in order to get a whole picture of your health. Often, there are physical exams and labs. Please bring your most recent blood work (labs), a list of all supplements and medications that you are taking, and complete your paperwork (through the portal invitation emailed to you) for the new patient appointment (it can take 45 minutes to fill out the paperwork, as it is quite thorough).
