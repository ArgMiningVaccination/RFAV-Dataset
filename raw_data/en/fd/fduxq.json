I reached to him after my cancer surgery four years ago...then I was in distress and looking for right guidance and support. With Dr Sahni help, I was treated for chronic constipation, lack of sleep and energy and emotional eating recovery...which helped me achieve better health. Many thanks to him for the same and I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for similar support. Hi everyone, here am sharing my experience with Dr Saini, i have been suffering with stiffness and pain in joints and muscles for years. I had taken so many treatments but nothing work for me. Recently I've been seeing Dr.Saini and in only one month of treatment my pain and stiffness gone. He has done fantastic job. I strongly recommend Pure Herbal Ayurved Clinic 100% Authentic Ayurveda Clinic.. Highly recommended for genuine ayurcedic treatments.. Can't recommend highly enough. After 18 months of working with other health professionals (including doctors, naturopaths, chiropractors and osteopaths), I was finally able to heal my body with simple dietary and lifestyle changes recommended by Dr Saini. Ayurvedic approach tackles not only physical health but also emotional and spiritual, and the herbs and treatments are also tailored to your particular dosha (body type). After working with Dr Saini for a few months I did the Panchkarma cleanse, which I was very skeptical about, but I was amazed that this fixed my gut problems. The treatments during Panchkarma were actually quite amazing - Pooja is a miracle worker and so lovely. Dr Saini's knowledge and client base is very highly regarded in the industry, with other well-known Ayurvedic resorts using this clinic when in Melbourne. Highly recommend. After struggling for years with energy levels, food intolerances and sleep issues with our daughter, we tried Dr Saini. The results for her have been outstanding. Her food intolerances (she was on a strict FODMAP diet) have all but disappeared. Her sleep is consistent and better. Her ability to regulate herself across an entire day (without falling into a heap) has improved her life quality 100 fold. His approach is thoughtful and considered. We always feel like he listens to all aspects of her health and adapts his methods to what she needs next. I would highly recommend working with Dr Saini to anyone considering it. Hello all, I have been consulting Dr. Saini for past 2years or so and have found his treatment very helpful and effective. He has a deep knowledge of Aryuveda and listens to your health issues, doubts and concerns patiently and advices Aryuved herbs and gives advice accordingly. He is kind and easy to talk to. I highly recommend Dr. Saini to anyone who is looking for treatment for their health issues or improving their overall health. Dr Saini has been so supportive in working with me to refine my mind, body and spirit to once again be able to consume gluten. Once I was diagnosed as gluten-intolerant, I thought I would never eat gluten again. But by embracing the ways of Ayurveda, I am now eating gluten on a daily basis that is pain free and discomfort free. Joseph Ferguson I have had a fantastic experience with Dr Saini at Pure Herbal clinic. The herbs I have taken as well as some dietary/lifestyle changes have brought me back into balance - my sleep has improved, my mental state has also improved I have more energy and am managing stress better. I would recommend going here for sure. Thanks Dr Saini! Kat Since September 2018, I have been in and out of hospital with consistent bowel and rectal issues. Three weeks after my last surgery this year, I literally stumbled across Pure Herbal. Dr Saini, (Ayurvedic Doctor) has been an absolute God send. I have worked closely with him since March. I have been extremely commited to the daily herbal regime, detox and treatments provided at Pure Health. At 46, I have never felt better physically, mentally and spiritually. What were constant symptoms, are now a thing of the past. I will continue this cleansing journey and with Dr Saini's expertise, I know my health will continue to improve. Thank you Dr Saini for the remarkable improvement in my health since first seeing you only 3 months ago. With herbal supplements, herbal teas and a single panchakarma treatment I have already experienced the following benefits that western medicine had not been able to assist: * Lower blood pressure permitting a reduction in medication. * Reduced anxiety. * No dizziness or fainting following sudden exercise such as climbing stairs. * Eye floaters gone. * Persistent (2 year) cough almost gone. * Frequent reflux gone. With continued treatment and lifestyle changes I am looking forward to: * normal blood pressure without medication, * weight loss without strict diets, * cough gone! I cannot recommend highly enough. This has been my first experience with Ayurvedic medicine and the Panchakarma cleanse and I can finally say that after years of striving for better health and wellbeing, I finally understand what is going to work for me moving forward. Having experience a traumatic event and subsequent PTSD 5 years ago, my gut and my body became increasingly compromised. In this time I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome and various ailments of the gut. I came to see Dr Saini and Pooja at a time that I felt frustrated with my years of work to see some more obvious progress with my healing. Having completed the Panchakarma cleanse, I am feeling fully renewed. Awake. Settled. I no longer struggle to wake each morning and get through each day. My appetite feels steady and all cravings have completely ceased. I now have some tools under my belt to fall back on when I know my digestive system needs a break. This cleanse has been a complete game changer. Thankyou Dr Saini and Pooja for you incredible guidance and support. Liz Meeting Dr, Saini has been a blessing here in Melbourne. I've always believed in holistic health and I was looking for a practitioner who could not only treat some deficiencies but bring my health up to speed. Dr, Saini is an esteemed Doctor with years of experience in holistic healing globally. I had been in poor health this year however through Pachkarma and Pure herbal Ayurveda Clinic's treatments, there has been a transformation in my overall health, energy and spirit. Highly recommended if you want to transform your health holistically and want to get out of the rut of medications. "}
