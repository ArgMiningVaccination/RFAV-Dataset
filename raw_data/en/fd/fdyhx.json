Our goal is to help you understand what brings on low back and neck pain, and how chiropractic treatments can restore your movement getting you back to what you love. MVA Neck and Headache Neck pain and headaches are often common reasons for seeking help from a chiropractor. Motor Vehicle Accidents (MVA) are one of the most common reasons of long-term pain. When you have a car accident it doesn't have to be a major one to cause serious musculoskeletal injuries. Studies show that in a rear impact fender bender the majority of damage done to the muscles, ligaments, and tendons of the neck, happens at speeds less than 12 mph, which can cause a whiplash injury. Unfortunately at these speeds, there is usually minor body damage to the cards, and treatment is only given to visible injuries. An exam is needed as soon as possible after an accident to evaluate the full extent of your injuries. If you have been in a car accident some whiplash symptoms to look for are neck stiffness and soreness, headaches, upper back, shoulder pain, and low back discomfort. Dr. Kirwan has years of experience treating these types of injuries. An appointment to evaluate your injuries is important to know if you may benefit from a chiropractor. If you are suffering from back pain, neck pain, headaches, or any other long-term pain it will not just disappear or improve over time. Masking the symptoms with medication is only a short-term fix that could lead to long-term health problems.
