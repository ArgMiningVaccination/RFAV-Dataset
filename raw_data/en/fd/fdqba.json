This balance is more readily achieved through a holistic approach, which is healing that addresses the whole person, in conjunction with traditional medicine. Traditional medicine often focuses on treating an illness, including substance use or mental disorders, solely from a physical perspective. While this may be effective, the risk for relapse can remain high. When holistic medicine is combined with traditional medicine, the likelihood of long-term recovery is greatly increased. How Aspects of the Body are Connected All parts of our being are in constant communication with one another. Anything one part perceives is instantly communicated to the entire being, prompting a response throughout the body. For example, when we experience fear, it doesn't just affect our mind. Although our thoughts may be panicked, our mind is racing, and our emotions are fluctuating wildly, we are also experiencing rapid breathing, sweating, a clenching in the stomach and may be praying for help. Every aspect of our being is affected by the perceived fear. Likewise, our entire being responds to pain, cravings, trauma, depression, stress, illness, joy, excitement or virtually any emotion, situation, or other stimulus. Because of this inter-connectedness, the most successful healing approaches address physical, psychological and spiritual health. Strengthening all aspects of the body leads to positive change, growth, and healing, and significantly increase the odds for long-term recovery. Mind, Body, Spirit Approach to Recovery Treatment centers using a holistic approach to treat substance use, eating disorders, and other mental disorders focus on the \"whole person,\" not just symptoms of the disorder. Combining proven traditional therapeutic approaches with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) can enhance healing and reduce [the risk of relapse](https://www.tpoftampa.com/how-common-is-relapse-after-rehab-and-how-can-it-be-avoided/). CAM approaches often incorporated into the treatment plan may include: - Meditation [Mindfulness](https://www.tpoftampa.com/the-role-of-mindfulness-meditation-and-yoga-in-all-stages-of-recovery/) - Deep breathing techniques - Positive thinking techniques [Yoga](https://www.tpoftampa.com/yoga-and-meditation-benefits-and-differences/) - Massage Therapy - Acupuncture - Stretching - Exercise - Nutritional Therapy Treatment providers often combine these alternative practices with individual, group, and family therapy, education on coping techniques and relapse prevention, support group participation, art and recreational therapies, and other traditional approaches. This multi-pronged approach seeks to break unhealthy behavior patterns, heal emotional wounds, identify and overcome self-sabotage, improve communication skills, and increase a sense of well-being and positive outlook. Studies support the effectiveness of integrating a mind, body, spirit approach to recovery. One such study found the complementary approach called mindfulness-oriented recovery enhancement (MORE) significantly reduced opioid cravings and chronic pain for those in recovery from opioid [use disorder](/why-we-use-the-term-substance-use-disorder-instead-of-substance-abuse/), according to the [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/research/research-results/mindfulnessoriented-recovery-enhancement-more-may-reduce-opioid-cravings-and-chronic-pain). At Turning Point of Tampa, our treatment approach is deeply rooted in the 12-step philosophy, emphasizing the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual needs of the entire person.
