First is knowing your purpose. Second is releasing anything within you that may inhibit pursuing your purpose. And the third is following through in completing all that you are meant to accomplish. Fulfilling the breadth of your purpose requires all your skills and talents. If great things were accomplished easily, they would not be so worthwhile. One aspect that is often overlooked in the chemistry of success is generating the needed spiritual power for you to succeed. For anything to manifest in your life, the spiritual energy first has to be in your auric field. For example, you may be in school to develop your talents and skills to excel at your chosen profession. Yet the ability to be successful is not just about talent and brains. There are many intelligent, talented people who are not successful. As you build your skills, you are also building spiritual power. By the laws of the divine life, once the spiritual energy builds to a certain crescendo, that energy will project into manifestation. The key is to immerse yourself in the goals you wish to reach. That activity needs to be a prominent part of your life and eventually it will produce results. If you know what the next steps are in completing your purpose, yet are having difficulties in turning those dreams into reality, here are three keys to keep in mind: Meditation Application Cooperation Meditation and prayer are essential tools to connecting with the Divine to receive the spiritual vitality you need. Through steady, meditative practice, you build the connection to the Divine. This opens the door to inspiration, guidance and direction. It also opens the door to building up spiritual power in your aura. Consistent application toward the goals you have set is the second key. Meditation without action is fruitless. Starting and stopping, doubting and procrastinating, diverting and digressing all spell disaster. And as you apply yourself, you are generating needed spiritual power. Then there is cooperation. Your purpose is never just about you; it's about your part in a larger plan. You pursue your purpose with others. This means that for you to succeed, you have to cooperate with others who are part of that purpose as well. It has to be a win/win for all involved. This brings up the fascinating principle that the spiritual seeds of your purpose are already ingrained in your auric field. You already have the tools to succeed. Yet like any seeds, they have to be nourished if they are to grow. This means that a part of you not only already knows your purpose, it is already in the process of realizing it. Sometimes, the key thing is for us to get out of our own way, and give room for the divine plan to unfold in us. Too often, we try to force or control too much. This means listening to your intuition and inspiration. It means not only working hard, but working smart. You want to economize your efforts to accomplish the most with the least amount of effort. Give yourself room to grow and unfold. Sometimes, the next steps to success are little and sometimes big, but every progressive step contributes to your purpose. Meditate with Divine Light every day to give you the power and support to accomplish all you came to this Earth to do. "}
