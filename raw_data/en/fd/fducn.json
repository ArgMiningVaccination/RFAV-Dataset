I'm not a sleep scientist or an immunologist, nor do I play either on TV. You likely fall in the same boat. But we do know from our own experience that -- after a poor night's sleep -- we are not at our best. If we have chronic sleep disruptions, we not only feel poorly, but our defenses are low and we are often more susceptible to viruses that cause the common cold. Interestingly, the sleep/common cold interaction has been scientifically examined by [Prather and colleagues](http://dx.doi.org/10.5665/sleep.4968) and sleep does matter to your resistance! As you likely know, the common cold is caused by a Coronavirus. This is a different one than that causing COVID-19, but this got me thinking. How might our immune system learn to fight COVID-19 from the vaccine and how important is sleep in that process? After all, the vaccine helps teach our immune system how to fight, how to resist this disease, and how to win against it so we don't get it or have a very mild case. Based upon the sleep-cold interaction, I'm left wondering: what does a poor night's sleep mean for how well our immune system learns from the COVID-19 vaccine? As a Stanford-trained PhD epidemiologist and University of Michigan biological science graduate, science intrigues me. I like trying to figure out puzzles and enjoy talking with others in different fields to understand new knowledge. To be honest, learning about other areas is like eating delicious brownies. I know this may seem a bit nerdy, but -- to me -- it is incredibly fun like a good mystery novel. So I poured a glass of milk and did a little investigating into sleep, vaccines and our immune system. Good sleep and your immune system Besedovsky, Lange and Born provide a nice summary of multiple scientific reports and studies by immunologists and sleep experts in their article titled \"Sleep and Immune Function\" (Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol (2012) 463:121-137 DOI 10.1007/s00424-011-1044-0) and in a more recent publication (2019), [The Sleep and Immune Cross-Talk in Health and Disease](https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.laneproxy.stanford.edu/pmc/articles/PMC6689741/?report=printable). In summary, they indicate that your immune system depends upon good sleep and functions poorly when levels are insufficient. They also discuss how sleep the night after a vaccine can impact your body's immune response, essentially affecting how well your immune system learns how to defend your body from the virus of interest in the vaccine lesson. After hundreds of thousands of Americans have died, seeing our economy in tremendous jeopardy, following social distance guidelines and always wearing a mask outside my home, I want to make sure that when I'm next in line to get the vaccine, it is as effective as possible, so I'm paying attention to this science puzzle. Fascinating studies on hepatitis A and B virus vaccinations (Lange T, Perras B, Fehm HL, Born J (2003) Sleep enhances the human antibody response to hepatitis A vaccination. Psychosom Med 65:831-835 73. Lange T, Dimitrov S, Bollinger T, Diekelmann S, Born J (2011) Sleep after vaccination boosts immunological memory. J Immunol 187:283-290) indicate that good sleep (at least six hours) the night after being vaccinated pays off with better and longer protection against these two viruses. More robust antigen-specific antibody blood levels and cells that are needed to support development of these antibodies were found in those with good sleep. There were also other immune-enhancing effects and these protective effects persisted over time. Use the free gift of sleep While I feel I've just scratched the surface (I hope some sleep and immune function experts will weigh in), scientific studies indicate sleep is a free tool you can use to improve not only your normal immune function but also how well your immune system learns to respond to a virus when you are vaccinated. Did you ever get a flu vaccine but then still get the flu? Maybe it was lack of sleep that diminished your body's ability to learn from the vaccine and mount a sufficient response to the flu virus when it circulated into your environment. Immunologists can probably further expand on things you can do to improve your immune system and how it \"learns\" from the COVID-19 vaccine, but suffice it to say, I certainly want my immune system to respond as strongly as possible to the COVID-19 virus now and for as long as possible. I'll be making a special effort to improve my sleep and make certain I get six or more hours post vaccine. This holiday season, give yourself the free gift of sleep and make certain that post vaccine you have a lovely long night of sleep.
