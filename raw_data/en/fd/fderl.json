Here are 9 ADHD supplements to consider.", "sitename": "Psych Central", "date": "2021-10-14", "cleaned_text": "Natural supplements may be an alternative or addition to ADHD medication, though it's important to check with your doctor first. - Best for neurological balance: [Polyphenols](#polyphenols) - Best for neurotransmitter balance: [Vitamin C](#vitamin-c) - cognitive function: [Zinc](#zinc) - Best for decreasing hyperactivity: [Iron](#iron) - Best for emotional regulation: [Magnesium](#magnesium) - Best for enhancing focus and memory: [Omega-3 and omega-6 fats](#omega-3s) - Best for improving attention span: [L-theanine](#theanine) - Best for promoting healthy gut and brain function: [Fermented foods or probiotics](#probiotics) - Best for improving sleep quality: [Melatonin](#melatonin) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition that causes impulsivity, inattentiveness, and/or hyperactivity among children and adults. People living with it may experience challenges with learning, focusing, sleeping, navigating relationships, and more. Medication is a popular way to manage [ADHD symptoms](https://psychcentral.com/adhd/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd-symptoms). But there are other options available for those who want to try a different approach. One alternative is supplements. There are many benefits of natural supplements for [ADHD in adults and children](https://psychcentral.com/adhd/adhd-overview). For starters, supplements can serve as an excellent addition to commonly prescribed medications. But \"where traditional therapies address just a few of the brain chemicals involved in attention, it's a delicate balance of factors governing the presence or absence of ADHD,\" explains [Uma Naidoo](https://umanaidoomd.com/), MD, nutritional psychiatrist, professional chef, nutrition specialist, and author of the bestseller \" [This Is Your Brain on Food](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49088685-this-is-your-brain-on-food).\" \"Supporting brain health for cognition and focus also confers holistic benefit to mood, development, and healthier aging,\" she adds. On the other hand, some people are hesitant to take ADHD medication, for whatever reason. And that's OK. For those who'd like a different approach to ADHD management, natural supplements may be a great alternative for improving brain functioning and overall quality of life. Still, it's good to remember that research on supplements for ADHD is often limited, and study results may be mixed. Plus, everyone is different, so what may work for one person may not work for you. That's why it's helpful to discuss different options with a healthcare professional, nutritionist, or both. Important to keep in mind Before taking any new supplement, there are some important precautions to consider. \"As a nutritional psychiatrist, I always encourage obtaining nutrients from whole foods sources first, while understanding that supplements can offer targeted nutritional benefits,\" Naidoo says. It's also worth noting that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn't regulate supplements in the same way as it regulates medication. So, it's best to proceed with caution. Before changing your diet or trying certain supplements, remember to do your research to find [high-quality products](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-choose-high-quality-vitamins-and-supplements). Talk with a healthcare professional about potential health risks and the ideal dosage for you. Many supplements can interact with certain medications, making the supplement, the medication, or both less effective. It's important to assess possible medication interactions with your doctor. If you're looking for a supplement for your child with ADHD, it's essential to talk with your child's pediatrician to ensure it's safe and discuss the best dosage. With tons of supplements on the market, it can be challenging to figure out which ones are best. Here's how we picked our list of the top natural ADHD supplements: - expert insight - anecdotal evidence - consumer reviews - available research Plus, the specific supplements we're suggesting in each section are manufactured according to high-quality standards by reputable brands. A note on price General price ranges with dollar signs ($ to $$$) are indicated below. One dollar sign means the product is lower priced, whereas three dollar signs indicate a higher price range. Keep in mind that the suggested supplements are very diverse, and tablet counts per bottle may vary greatly. Therefore, a direct price comparison isn't possible. Some products may be available in multipacks or bottles of different sizes, which may lower or raise the price, too. Pricing guide: - $ = under $20 - $$ = $20-$40 - $$$ = over $40 Best for neurological balance: Polyphenols \" [Polyphenols](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/polyphenols) are naturally occurring plant nutrients which serve as powerful antioxidants while strengthening the immune system,\" Naidoo says. She notes that they also play an important role in restoring neurological balance in people living with ADHD. A [2018 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5946190/) Naidoo says the brains of people with ADHD may be more prone to oxidative damage. But consuming polyphenols may help reduce it, either through supplements or \" [eating the rainbow](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/eat-the-rainbow).\" For example, polyphenols can be found in: - blueberries - blackberries - raspberries - eggplant - onion - kale [Codeage Polyphenols Broad Spectrum](https://www.amazon.com/Codeage-Protective-Polyphenol-Antioxidants-Resveratrol/dp/B07NRKDQPN?&linkCode=ll1&tag=psychcentral-adhd-supplements-20&linkId=d7664aab14dac29427b29dc2db940f4c&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) - Price: $$ What we like - It's produced in the United States in a facility.

It's important to talk with your doctor if you're taking medication and are interested in trying polyphenol supplements. - Getting polyphenols through a balanced diet is recommended. - Research on whether taking a polyphenol supplement may improve ADHD symptoms is lacking. Best for neurotransmitter balance: Vitamin C \"For similar reasons as above, vitamin C may prove key as a dietary approach to ADHD management due to its antioxidant properties as well as being a necessary element of neurotransmitter balance in the brain, especially dopamine,\" Naidoo says. Research on ADHD and vitamin C specifically is limited. A [2006 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16314082/) However, it's unclear whether the improvements were due to vitamin C, flax oil, or the combination of both. Naidoo says some of her favorite [sources of vitamin C](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-c-foods) (also known as ascorbic acid) include: - citrus fruits - red bell peppers - kiwi [NOW Foods Chewable C-500](https://www.amazon.com/Supplements-Vitamin-Orange-Chewable-Lozenges/dp/B000A0HCM4?&linkCode=ll1&tag=psychcentral-adhd-supplements-20&linkId=f884b28bbcccbfbf86ffaab30cfe0502&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) - Price: $ What we like - One chewable lozenge provides 500 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C. - NOW Foods tests all products in house for purity and potency. - The supplement is produced in a CGMP certified facility.

For example, it's that people undergoing chemotherapy speak with their oncologist before taking vitamin C supplements. [recommended](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/#h9) - If you're taking cholesterol-lowering medications (statins), your doctor monitoring your lipid levels if you're also taking vitamin C or another antioxidant supplement. [may suggest](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/#h9) Best for cognitive function: Zinc Micronutrients like zinc play a major role in the [brain and ADHD](https://psychcentral.com/adhd/adhd-in-the-brain-how-does-it-work), says Naidoo. \"Where zinc modulates reward pathways in the brain, which govern focused activity, a [2021 systemic review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94124-5) Upping your zinc intake may help you improve brain function, including neurotransmitter production.

[may interact](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-HealthProfessional/#h9) Best for decreasing hyperactivity: Iron Research suggests there's a correlation between ADHD symptoms and low iron, since a lot of people with ADHD have low iron scores. [Older research](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/485884) There isn't too much research on whether or not taking iron will definitely help, but [older studies](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/116/5/e732.long) suggest it could. On the other hand, [research from 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5946190/) If it's difficult for you or your child with ADHD to eat [iron-rich foods](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthy-iron-rich-foods), like beans, lentils, or dark green leafy vegetables, Naidoo suggests: - adding a handful of spinach to a smoothie - topping soups with arugula - mixing kale into a Tuscan white bean stew - snacking on crispy homemade roasted baby spinach \"chips\" You can also consume the nutrient itself by taking an iron supplement. But be careful with the dosage, as too much iron can lead to [iron poisoning](https://www.healthline.com/health/iron-poisoning).

[1.8 times higher](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/) Best for emotional regulation: Magnesium \"Magnesium is well known for its relaxing effects on the body and brain,\" Naidoo says. A [small 2021 study](https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-021-02631-1) Plus, it's unclear whether magnesium, vitamin D, or the combination of both improved symptoms in that study. Naidoo explains that magnesium may help promote a sense of calmness in people with ADHD, including those who experience difficulty regulating their emotions. \"In those taking stimulant medications, a healthy dose of magnesium by what they eat at dinner may help [insomnia](https://psychcentral.com/disorders/insomnia),\" Naidoo adds. Great [food sources of magnesium](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-foods-high-in-magnesium) include: - cashews - avocados - dark chocolate (75% and darker) - whole grain brown rice It's important to dose magnesium appropriately, though.

Taking a supplement with L-theanine or both ingredients may help relieve these ADHD symptoms. Still, it's important to keep in mind that this study was very small, and what works for some people may not work for others.
