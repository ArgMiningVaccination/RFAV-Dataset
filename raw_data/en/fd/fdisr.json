Naturally rich in antioxidants and other nutrients, it is often used to make a cleansing herbal tea or mixed with lemonade to help flush out toxins from the body. But aside from its ability to detoxify the body, red clover is also known for its skin-soothing properties. When made into a healing salve, red clover can be used to relieve dry or chapped skin, minor wounds and burns and other skin conditions, such as psoriasis, acne and eczema. Learn how to make your own red clover salve by following this simple guide. (h/t to SurvivalSullivan.com) It can take less than an hour to make your very own DIY red clover healing salve. This simple recipe uses only all-natural, non-toxic ingredients that are gentle on your skin. The great thing about this healing salve is that you can adjust the recipe to suit your needs. If you want to increase the potency of your salve, you can add more red clover to the mixture. You may even add other herbs, such as chamomile or echinacea. This recipe is so versatile that it can even be used to make a DIY red clover lip balm just by increasing the amount of coconut oil by one third. Ingredients: 4 parts fresh red clover flowers or 2 parts dried red clover herb 4 parts coconut oil 1 part beeswax pellets or finely chopped beeswax pastilles Other herbs, as desired Water Mason jar Measuring cups Measuring spoons Fine mesh strainer Double boiler or small cook pot Procedure: Fill a double boiler or small cook pot with four inches of water. Fill the mason jar with red clover herb and other herbs of your choice. Pour coconut oil into the mason jar. Make sure to fully soak the herbs. If the coconut oil has solidified, move the chunks around the bottle to get rid of air pockets. Place the double boiler or small cook pot on the stove and set it on medium heat. Set the mason jar at the center of the double boiler or small cook pot. Allow the mixture to simmer for at least 30 minutes. You can let the mixture simmer for a little longer to make sure that all the nutrients are fully extracted. After about half an hour, use your fine mesh strainer to separate the solids from the liquid. Pour the liquid mixture back into the mason jar. Carefully add the beeswax to the mixture. Stir the mixture with a spoon so that it settles evenly. Turn the stove back on and set it on medium heat. Allow the mixture to simmer once more until all the beeswax is fully melted. Keep stirring the mixture to prevent the wax from clumping or scorching. After five minutes or when at least 85 percent of the beeswax has melted, remove the mixture from the stove. Store your red clover salve in a clear glass or plastic container with a firm-fitting lid. Whenever you have dry skin or chapped lips, simply apply a small amount of the salve to the affected area.
