Use the word DETERMINE to remind you of the Warning Signs DISEASE Any disease, illness or chronic condition which causes you to change the way you eat, or m akes it hard for you to eat, puts your n utritional health at risk. Four out of five adults have chronic dis eases that are affected by diet. Confusion or memory loss that keeps getting worse is estimated to affect one out of five or more of older adults. Th is can make it hard to remember what, wh en o r if you've eaten. Feeling sad or depressed, which happens to a bout one in eight older adults, can cause big changes in appetite, digestion, energy level, weight and well -being. EATING POORLY Eating too little and eating too much both lead to poor h ealth. Eating the same foods day after day or not eating fruit, veg etables, and milk products daily will also cause poor nutritional health. One in five adults skip meals daily. Only 13% of adults eat the minimum amo unt of fruit and vegetables needed. One in four older adults drink too much alcohol. Many health problems b ecome worse if you drink more than one or two alcoholic beverages per day. TOOTH LOSS/MOUTH PAIN A healthy mouth, teeth and gums are needed to eat . Missing, loose , or rotten teeth or dent ures which don't fit well, or cause mouth sores, make it hard to e at. ECONOMIC HARDSHIP As many as 40% of older Americans have incomes of less than $6,000 per year. Having less -- or choosing to spend less -- than $25-30 per week for food makes it very hard to get the foods you need to stay healthy. REDUCED SOCIAL C ONTACT One-third of all older people live alone. Being with people daily has a positive effect on morale, well -being and eating. MULTIPLE MEDICINES Many older Americans must take medicin es for health problems. Almost half of older Americans take multip le medicines daily. Growing old may change the way we respond to drugs. The more medicines you take, the greater the chance for side effects such as i ncreased or decreased appetite, change i n taste, constipation, weakness, drowsiness, diarrhea, nausea, and others. Vitamins or minerals, when taken in large doses, act like drugs and can cause harm. Alert your doctor to everything y ou take. INVOLUNTARY W EIGHT LOSS/GAIN Losing or gaining a lot of weight when you are not trying to do so is an important warnin g sign that must not be ignored. Being overweight or underweight also increases your chance of poor health. NEEDS ASSISTANCE IN SELF -CARE Although most older people are able to eat, one o f every five have trouble walking, shopping, buying and cooking fo od, especially as they get older. ELDER YEARS ABOVE AGE 80 Most older people lead full and productive lives. But as age increases, risk of frailty and health problems increase. Checking y our nutritional health regularly makes good sense.

Nutrition screening : All participants in the Senior Nutrition Programs should be screened annually usin g the DETERMI NE Nutrition Screening Assessment Tool. Understandably, getting 100% completion - especially in congrega te centers - is difficult. The numbers of returned screening forms for both congregate and home delivered meals participants and the percen tage scoring higher than a 6 (high nutritional risk) needs to be reported. Breaking the reporting of this tool down by home delivered/congregat e and high/low nutrition risk will allow greater understanding of the nutritional well -being of our participants . High N utritional Risk (defined): per the DETERMINE Nutrition Screening form to score a 6 or greater. Anyone at high nutritional risk should be targeted for nutrition education/counseling/assessment/support F.
