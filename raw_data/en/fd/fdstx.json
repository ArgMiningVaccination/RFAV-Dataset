This series responds to the many questions raised as conventional health care practitioners encounter widespread and increasing use of complementary and al-ternative therapies. Each publication in the series highlights one or more of the key issues facing health professionals today\u2014including assessing information, safety, ef- fectiveness, and the integration of conven- tional, complementary, and alternativehealth care. Assessing the Effectiveness of Comple- mentary & Alternative Medicine examines the issues raised when conventional health carepractitioners seek to answer the deceptively simple question: \"Do complementary and alternative therapies work?\" Responding tothat question requires an understanding of different healing paradigms, measurement techniques, and sources of information.PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 2004PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 2004Assessing the Effectiveness ofComplementary & Alternative Medicine foreword T he widespread use of complementary and alternative medicine by over 40 percent of the U.S. population (Eisenberg, et al., 1998) presents the conventional health care practitioner with a considerable challenge: How to assess the effectiveness of awide variety of therapies and treatments that are largelyunfamiliar. The difficulty arises because the simple question\u2014Does it work?\u2014often does not have a simple answer. To fully answer that question, it is first necessary to appreciate the different healing approaches of conventional medicine and many complementary and alternative therapies,and to understand how these differences affect treatment ap- proaches and measurement of outcomes. Additionally, one must understand how conventional research methodologiesand evidence reporting limit or conflict with the ability to accurately assess complementary and alternative therapies' ef- fectiveness. Finally, one must know where to find reliable in-formation about the effectiveness of such therapies. This publication explores the issues raised when tech- niques for measuring efficacy in conventional medicine are applied to the measurement of effectiveness in the clinicalsetting of a complementary/alternative medical practice. In particular, readers are invited to: Distinguish between \"effectiveness\" and \"effi-CONTENTS Explaining Effectiveness: Reflecting on Different Approaches to Healing ............... 3 Evaluating Evidence for CAM Effectiveness ....... 5 Problems in Measuring Efficacy & Effectiveness in CAM .................................... 7 Efficacy & Effectiveness of Complementary Medical Modalities:Systematic Reviews & Meta-Analyses ......... 11 Example 1: Craniosacral Therapy ................... 12 Example 2: Bias in Reporting on CAM Therapies ........................................... 13 Example 3: Ginkgo Extract ............................. 14 Summary .................................................... 14 References ................................................... 15PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 2004cacy,\" and to understand how these terms apply to conventional, complementary, and alternative medicine; Understand the problems that exist in measuring the effectiveness of complementaryand alternative therapies, and the limitations of conventional measurement tools; Understand where to look for and how to evaluate evidence for CAM effectiveness. Finally, a note about the terminology used in this publication. In recent years, the term \"CAM\" has come into common usage to describe, in the words of the National Center for Comple- mentary and Alternative Medicine, \"a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine.\" Despite itsconvenient brevity, the acronym CAM has some unfortunate implications. It suggests, for example, a homogeneity among the practices included under the umbrella term\u2014something that is not at all true. It also implies a clear and complete distinction between conventional and CAM systems ofcare. That also is inaccurate. The term CAM is therefore used sparingly here. When used, it is shorthand for that \"group of diverse medical and health care systems. . .\" where the emphasis is on the word \"diverse.\" Susan Gaylord Sally Norton Peter Curtis Series EditorsASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20041 Assessing the Effectiveness Of Complementary & Alternative Medicine Effectiveness of care\u2014the positive outcome of treatment\u2014is the result of a combination of fac- tors, including: the efficacy of an intervention, the ap- proach to the patient , the response of the patient , and the set- ting in which the care is given. Effectiveness also may reflect certain aspects of the placebo or \"expectancy\"effect (Flay, 1986). By contrast, efficacy offers a morelimited assessment ( see box, right )\u2014describing whether a technology, procedure, or treatment is helpful or harm-ful under optimum conditions. Tests of efficacy are nec-essary steps in the development of new technologies orpharmaceuticals, but do not necessarily demonstrate ef-fectiveness in the real world. Because of costs, safety issues, and the domi- nance of pharmaceutical interventions, demonstratingefficacy has relied heavily on a single tool for the mea-surement of a biological therapeutic effect\u2014the ran-domized controlled clinical trial (RCT). This researchtechnique: tests a well-specified and standardized treat- ment; is delivered uniformly in a standard settingto specified subjects; is designed for those who ideally have onlythe target condition being treated; and includes agreements with subjects to com-ply and adhere to the protocol, usually for a reward (Flay, 1986). Because of this design, efficacy studies specifi- cally exclude multiple, \"real world\" clinical factors, suchEFFICACY VS EFFECTIVENESS It is important to distinguish between the terms \"efficacy\" and \"effectiveness\" when evaluating outcomes of treatment. Efficacymeans that the treatment or substance (surgery, medication, herbalremedy) clearly produces a change in biological or psychosocialfunction under optimum conditions\u2014after excluding other possiblecauses for the change. That biological change may be beneficial ordeleterious. Effectiveness, on the other hand, refers to the treatment'ssuccess in day-to-day clinical practice. EfficacyEfficacyEfficacyEfficacyEfficacy is most usefully demonstrated under rigorous experimental conditions and has been described as \"fastidiousefficacy\" (Kaptchuk, 2002a). Such studies seek to optimize the internal validityinternal validityinternal validityinternal validityinternal validity of a research study\u2014the certainty with which conclusions can be drawn from the study because of its rigor anddesign. But, the more complex, controlled, and rigorous the study,the less one can generalize the results to day-to-day practice(external validityexternal validityexternal (Kaptchuk, 2002a). This meansthat the treatment works for patients in the routine practice setting(the real world), in which many other factors\u2014such as the placeboeffect and the style of the clinician\u2014may also contribute to thepatient's outcomes. An effective treatment must not only beefficacious, but also must be available and acceptable to the patientin normal day-to-day life. Thus, a drug shown to be efficacious in a research setting might not actually be effective in practice, for example, becausepatients cannot tolerate its side effects, or because it must be takeneight times a day and no patient is likely to adhere to this regimen.Another example of reduced effectiveness of an efficacious drug iswhen a health professional administers it suboptimally orinappropriately. Furthermore, the effectiveness seen in day-to-daypractice might be due more to the placebo or caring effect than tothe drug. Outcomes of complementary and alternative medicine can be studied by using both efficacy and effectiveness research.THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20042 as the approach to the patient, treatment setting, adherence to medication protocols, and lifestyle issues. The model of single-intervention clinical trials may be more useful for studying pharma- ceutical treatments than for assessing outcomes of most complementary and alternative therapieswhere treatment protocols usually are tailored to individuals rather than a standard group ofsubjects. For example, clinical trial results are reported as means, medians, or likelihood ratios forthe large numbers of subjects studied (populations). T hese results offer generalized data that guide clinicians' decisions about specific therapies and diseases. However, they do not offer thedetailed information (individual response and susceptibility to ad verse effects) that might apply to the individual patient sitting opposite the clinician (Welch & Lurie, 2000). Indeed, the limits of theRCT approach to determining the clinical merits of complementary and alterna tive interventions are important, given the highly individualiz ed and multi-faceted treatment protocols typically em- ployed. Assessment of complementary and alternative ther apy effectiveness may require a differ- ent approach to gathering and interpreting evidence. Similar challenges have been found in other therapies that, while recognized as \"conven- tional medicine,\" have complex interactive factors or cannot be measured by hard biological data.For example, the disciplines of psychotherapy, health behavior, and psychiatry faced the challengeof how to measure program and thera peutic outcomes, finally discarding or modifying efficacy studies in favor of effectiveness studies (Flay, 1986; Carroll & Rounsaville, 2003). The simple question\u2014 Does it work? \u2014is appropriate when asked about a pharmaceutical product in a conventional clinical setting, because its answer can be obtained from standardizedclinical trials. It is also an appropriate question when asked about a specific, isolated complemen- tary treatment such as the use of a single nutritional supplement\u2014for example, alpha lipoic acidfor painful peripheral neuropathy. However, in the clinical world of many complementary and alternative practices, \"it\"\u2014 the treatment\u2014is not typically a single drug or intervention, but acomplex therapeutic modality that also may involve physical andemotional interaction with the therapist. rethinking assumptions about efficacy Clinicians have long assumed that pharmaceutical research and the FDA approval process ensure that medications are de-monstrably effective for patients. That assumption is now suspect.A report of a speech by Allen Roses, a pharmacogeneticist at DukeUniversity and Vice President at Glaxo Wellcome, cited research(The Independent newspaper, UK, Monday, December 8, 2003) re- vealing that most pharmaceuticals are efficacious for only 30-50percent of patients, because of individual genetic characteristics.An example of pharmaceutical response rates is seen in Table 1. Despite enormous effort and investment, the reality of clinical medicine is that it falls well below our assumptions andexpectations regarding efficacy. It may well be that attention to theindividual rather than the group response to therapy may producemore information about how to target treatment and follow-up,and improve outcomes.TTTTTABLE 1ABLE 1ABLE CONDITIONSTH CONDITIONSTH CONDITIONS % P % P % P % P % P AAAAATIENTSTIENTSTIENTSTIENTSTIENTS CONDITIONCONDITIONCONDITIONCONDITIONCONDITION REPORTINGREPORTINGREPORTINGREPORTINGREPORTING Cancer 25% (Roses, 2003)ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20043 assessing effectiveness in clinical practice Not only is treatment effectiveness influenced by multiple factors, but its assessment may depend on the clinician's healing paradigm, such as biomedical, homeopathic, or naturopathic.Long proposes three effects that play a role in the assessment of a CAM treatment's effectiveness; the dominance of each of these may vary, depending on the type of complementary approach(Long, 2002). They are: The effect of the philosophy of healing (self-healing, balance, systems approach, and holism); The effect of the clinician-patient relationship; and The set of therapeutic methods used to enhance the healing process. Homeopathy offers an example of the effect of healing philosophy on the evaluation of outcomes. Despite evidence from randomized studies and meta-analyses of some homeopathictreatments\u2014which show a significant beneficial effect\u2014many conventional clinicians strongly re-ject scientific conclusions of effectiveness of homeopathy therapy because the \"non-material\"nature of homeopathic remedies is outside the conventional scientific paradigm and is dismissed asplacebo (Linde, et al., 1997; Feder & Katz, 2002). explaining effectiveness: reflecting on different approaches to healing A question the conventional clinician is likely to ask about a complementary and alternative therapy\u2014such as mindfulness, homeopathy, or acupuncture\u2014is whether CAM practitioners are simply har- nessing the placebo effect to meet the deep 'human' needs of patients, or are actually giving effective care (Kaptchuk, 2002a). The question is asked with the expectation that these therapies should be assessed by the same methods used for a conventional medical treatment or drug. Theresponse of the CAM practitioner to that question is likely to be, \"Yes, we believe our approach/modality/remedy really works, beyond the placebo effect.\" Often, that conviction emanates from a wholly different view on evidence of effectiveness. Conventional medicine generally takes a material and reductionist approach to treatment. An assessment of constellations of symptoms or test results leads to the application of a diagnos-tic label, followed by a specific treatment progr am targeted at the diagnosis, not the patient. Typi- cally, the primary focus of the treatment program is management of clinical markers (such asplatelet counts) or symptoms. Ideally, treatment decisions are based on evidence from researchstudies. In contrast, many therapies under the rubric of \"CAM\" tend to a more holistic, individu- alized approach to symptoms within a broad context of the patient's life. The context may be more important than the symptoms, or at least may provide insight into the interpretation of the symp-tom pattern. For example, homeopathic remedies , particularly for chronic conditions, are com- monly selected based on the totality of symptoms and personal constitutional characteristics ofthe patient. This contrasts with the conventional medical approach, which is to assign a diagnosis to a group of symptoms and then apply a specific treatment protocol with little or no individual-ization relative to constitutional variation. In homeopathy, the diagnosis is believed to fully de-scribe the patient and the patient's medical needs also define the course of treatment. Rather than just managing a disease process, holistic treatment also focuses on rebalanc- ing and supporting the body's systems as an aggregate whole, rather than correcting specific symp-THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20044 toms or confirming diagnoses. Symptoms can be a signal for the CAM clinician of some form of emotional or biological dysfunction or disregulation, rather than a well-defined pattern that alwaysrepresents the same disease entity. Moreover, a disease state may be understood to have a non-material (e.g., energy, spiritual) source and solution. different perspective on effectiveness These differences in perspective have a profound impact on the assessment of effective- ness. In conventional medical practice, for example, the focus is usually on a standard of care applicable to a large number of people and the desired outcome is a certain percentage of successwith a single medication or other treatment. Elimination or reduction of symptoms is also consid-ered an indicator of effective treatment, so effectiveness is also often defined in terms of short- term clinical outcomes defined by researchers, not necessarily the patient's goal. On the otherhand, holistic practitioners, with their focus on individual tr eatment, are unlikely to measure effec- tiveness in terms of a percentage of success with large numbers of patients. They will tend,instead, to evaluate a treatment's outcomes for an individual patient. Further, since many CAMtherapies are designed to stimulate self-healing, their eff ectiveness may be measured over a longer time period, and short-term outcomes are less relevant. Defining \"effectiveness\" for a given therapy is further complicated by the nature of many complementary and alternative treatments, w hich involve multiple components whose benefits are derived, at least in part, from their interaction with each other. Similarly, many holistic care planscombine specific treatments (such as acupuncture) with complementary therapies such as diet andexercise. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, for example, remedies containing a number of herbalpreparations will often be given in conjunction with acupuncture, meditation, exercises, and di-etary guidance. While it may be difficult to determine the precise role each component plays inhealing, it seems clear that the combination of elements contributes to the success of a CAM care plan (Vickers & Zollman, 1999; Spinella, 2002). Compared to conventional medicine, it is also more challenging to measure outcomes of CAM treatments by the presence, absence, or change of symptoms. This is because differenthealing systems regard the relevance of symptoms diff erently. In homeopathy, for example, treat- ment may at first intensify symptoms (Leckridge, 1997). The transient worsening of symptoms isconsidered to be a sign of the remedy's impact and ideally will be followed by a healing response.In the process of healing, particularly from chr onic conditions, there may be a temporary return of old symptoms. It is also considered a good sign when returning symptoms shift the focus ofillness from more vital to less vital organ systems. the power of beliefs in determining effectiveness There are no research data to suggest that, overall, the role of placebo is different for complementary and alternative thera pies than for conventional medicine. Patients' beliefs about treatments and medicines play an important role in any healing setting (Peters, 2001). However,CAM practitioners' more leisurely and patient-centered approach fits the model described by Benson(1997) for obtaining a non-specific placebo effect. T he non-specific placebo effect is that pro- duced by the clinical setting and health professionals' style, rather than the specific placebo orchemical effect of the intervention (such as manual therapy or acupuncture needling). It is likely,therefore, that practitioners of complementary and alterna tive therapies may achieve some of their success by maximizing the non-specific placebo response (Kaptchuk, 2002b). To the extent thatASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20045 conventional practitioners also engage in a patient-center ed model of care, their treatment will be influenced by such non-specific positive effects. The relationship between the placebo or \"expectancy\" effect and many complementary and alternative modalities presents a challenge to those attempting to measure treatment effective- ness. For many CAM practitioners, it is a goal of the therapy to engage the patient (including thepatient's emotional and physical expectations) in the healing pr ocess. This can make it more diffi- cult, if not impossible, to control f or the placebo effect in study design. Other beliefs also influence the success of a treatment or therapy. In the United States, cultural bias may include lower expectations for CAM treatments. This may be especially true when a patient comes to a CAM practitioner as a last resort after conventional medicine has failedto help (Kaptchuk, 2002b). evaluating evidence for complementary & alternative medicine effectiveness Clinicians are faced with five basic questions about the effectiveness of a given CAM therapy orhealing system: 1.To what extent is it proven to be efficacious and effective? 2.Is its effectiveness also dependent on the placebo effect? 3.For which patients and conditions would this treatment be beneficial? 4.If it is effective, should it be incorporated into routine medical care? 5.If it is effective, is it cost-effective? In general, current research on effectiveness of CAM is directed towards answering the first three questions. As with conventional medicine, incorporation into routine practice and cost-effectiveness take many years to be well demonstrated. Studies of effectiveness usually consist of clinical trials comparing treatments (as well as comparing treatment with no treatment) in real-world health care settings (Lewith, Walach & Jonas,2002). The amount of such research in the field of complementary and alternative medicine issubstantial. In 1998, it was reported that over 690 scientific journals published CAM articles through-out the world (Ezzo, Berman, Vickers, & Linde, 1998). A substantial proportion of this researchhas been conducted and published in other countries (such as Germany and France), where comple-mentary/alternative medicine has been incorporated for some time into the health care system andmedical education. Similarly, countries such as India and China that still consider their traditionalhealing systems to be a key element in health care have long-established institutions of research fornatural substances at the laboratory, pharmacological, and clinical levels. There are over 10,000published basic science and clinical studies (of efficacy and effectiveness) involving many styles ortraditions of acupuncture techniques, of which over 500 were randomized controlled trials. Addi-tionally, meta-analysis (the pooling of data from many studies) is a useful tool that has, for example,strongly supported the benefit of acupuncture for the treatment of nausea and various pain syn-dromes (Kaptchuk, 2002a). Despite the international volume of research on alternative and complementary therapies, conventional practitioners in the United States may have diff iculty finding evidence of CAM outcomes. Although there are numerous published studies on some CAM therapies, such as acu-puncture and chiropractic, there are many other complementary and alternative therapies, such asTHE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20046 craniosacral and magnet therapy, with only a fe w small studies (Green, Martin, Bassett, & Kazanjian, 1999; Alfano, et al., 2001) on which little research has been done. Given that only a few of the 690 journals publishing complementary and alternative medicine articles are published in English and considered \"mainstream\" in the United States,relevant data may be out of reach for the practicing clinician (Ezzo, et al., 1998). Although the clinician interested in researching evidence for a particular therapy can access such databases asAMED, Med-line (PubMed), EMBASE, ASCOM, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Re-views, search strategies for clinical evidence of complementary and alternative therapies' efficacy and effectiveness may still be limited in scope (Ezzo, et al., 1998; Sigouin & Jadad, 2002). Forexample, only 50 percent of the actual number of RCTs in conventional medicine find their way onto Medline, and the percentage is much lower for studies of non-conventional therapies (Ezzo,et al., 1998). Clinicians might best seek out integrative medicine conferences for accessing themost pertinent continuing medical education. In the United States, the major initiative promoting research on the effectiveness on the outcomes of CAM has come from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medi-cine (www.nccam.nih.gov). NCCAM has steadily increased its capacity to fund scientifically basedprojects, including setting up a variety of CAM centers of excellence in academic institutions tostudy specific modalities, clinical problems, or integrative services in collaboration with comple-mentary and alternative practitioners.TABLE 2 SUMMARY OF CAM EFFECTIVENESS FOR SELECTED MEDICAL CONDITIONS problem problem problem problem problem therapiestherapiestherapiestherapiestherapies evidence low to moderate uncertain AnxietyAnxietyAnxietyAnxietyAnxiety K ava, relaxation, aromatherapy moderate positive AsthmaAsthmaAsthmaAsthmaAsthma Hypnosis, homeopathy, yoga low to moderate positive EczemaEczemaEczemaEczemaEczema P rimrose oil, Chinese herbs moderate uncertain Back PBack PBack PBack PBack P ainainainainain Acupuncture, FChronic FChronic FChronic FChronic F atigueatigueatigueatigueatigue Exercise, moderate positive ConstipationConstipationConstipationConstipationConstipation Biofeedback, massage, herbals low to high positive DepressionDepressionDepressionDepressionDepression St. John's wort, relaxation, music low to high positive FibromyalgiaFibromyalgiaFibromyalgiaFibromyalgiaFibromyalgia Exercise, homeopathy, biofeedback low to moderate positive HypercholesterolemiaHypercholesterolemiaHypercholesterolemiaHypercholesterolemiaHypercholesterolemia Diet, garlic, guar gum, red yeast rice high positive InsomniaInsomniaInsomniaInsomniaInsomnia K ava, valerian, relaxation, melatonin moderate positive MigraineMigraineMigraineMigraineMigraine Acupuncture, biofeedback, feverfew moderate PPPPPalliative Carealliative Carealliative Hyperplasiarostatic Hyperplasia P moderate positive (Adapted from Ernst, 2001)ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20047 examples of assessing the effectiveness of CAMCAMCAMCAMCAM There is evidence supporting the efficacy and effectiveness of a number of complemen- tary and alternative therapies for different health conditions. Table 2, for example, summarizesresearch on the efficacy and effectiveness of selected therapies for common clinical problems for which some evidence has accumulated. (A positive direction of evidence indicates that the treat- ment provides benefit; a negative direction indicates no benefit for the clinical problem.) Nonethe- less, there remains considerable variability in the amount and quality of effectiveness data avail-able. An example of an analysis of the weight of evidence in complementary and alternative medicine is the article published in the journal Rheumatology, \"Herbal Medicines for the Treatment of Osteoarthritis: A Systematic Review\" (Long, Soeken, & Ernst, 2001). In this article, the authors(from Exeter University, UK, and the University of Maryland School of Medicine, US) indicatethat current conventional treatment of osteoarthritis with NSAIDs causes about 2,000 deaths ayear. They also conclude that there is still a need for safe and effective drugs for patients who don't respond well to conventional therapy. They searched the literature for RCTs of herbal remedies for osteoarthritis, and found 12 trials and 2 systematic reviews. (Some of these were unreplicatedstudies.) Eleven remedies combi- nation); cohosh, sarsaparilla, and poplar bark); stingingnettle; and willow bark. After reviewing the w eight of evidence they made the following recom- mendations: Moderately strong (3+ favorable trials) evidence for: phytodolor, capsaicin. Promising evidence (2 trials with favorable outcomes) for: ASU, devil's claw. Weak evidence (1 trial with favorable outcome) for: reumalex, willow bark, stingingnettle, articulin-F. No evidence (no positive trials) for eazmov, gitadyl, ginger extract. The authors indicate that there were some generally promising complementary and alter- native options for clinical care, but compared to conventional treatments these were still substan-tially under-researched. problems in measuring efficacy & effectiveness in CAMCAMCAMCAMCAM Research into the outcomes of complementary and alternative therapies must account for a num- ber of factors incompatible with conventional research methodologies. These include: the role of individualized treatment for the patient; the variability of products as well as the expected variability in clinical approach, as in Traditional Chinese Medicine (Zhang, Bausell, Lao, Handwerger, & Berman, 2003); the use of simultaneous, synergistic, multiple interventions (e.g., exercise, relaxation,herbs, diet); the therapeutic interaction between herbs and nutritional supplements; and the role of the skilled practitioner (who cannot be blinded) as an element of treat-ment.THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20048 All these factors complicate the process of designing efficacy studies because conven- tional research design consciously excludes them. In most complementary/alternative practices,individualized diagnosis and treatment and multiple, synergistic interventions are essential com-ponents of the treatment program and cannot be excluded. Thus, many CAM treatment modali-ties used are not easily standardized. Thus, rather than attempting to evaluate them with standard-ized research designs and techniques, different assessment methods are needed. design challenges From the perspective of conventional medicine and federal funding, only large, blinded, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) using strictly defined interventions are seen as the ideal solutionto separate the real from the apparent clinical effects of a treatment. However, as previously dis-cussed, research design challenges are presented by both conventional and complementary treat- ments that employ complex, individualized therapies in which the therapist is part of the treatment.Research designs of studies of these therapies often are labeled as \"flawed\" by the conventionalresearch establishment. Many earlier RCTs were of poor methodological quality (De Smet, 2002;Taylor, Reilly, Llewellyn-Jones, McSharry, & Aitchison, 2000). Now, well-designed, large clinical trials and meta-analyses of some complementary/alternative therapies have recently begun to ap-pear in major medical journals (for example: St. John's Wort to treat depression; ginkgo rhinitis). Many ofthese are pharmacologically active therapies that can be isolated as a single intervention and pre-scribed in the form of a pill. Although the RCT is regarded as the \"best science\" research method with strong internal validity, the results often do not represent the real world of clinical practice because of the highlycontrolled conditions and sometimes unrealistic settings of the studies (Eskinazi & Muehsam,2000; Nahin & Straus, 2001). Many believe tha t other research methodologies are more applicable to CAM studies (Lewith, Jonas, & Walach, 2002). Alterna tive approaches, N-of-1 studies (intermittent crossover measur es for a single patient over an extended period of time) may offer more relevant data for assessing therapeutic effectiveness. varied clinical approaches In CAM, as in some conventional therapeutics, diagnosis and treatment protocols are not always the same among clinicians in the same discipline. For example, not all chiropractors prac-tice in like ways\u2014they are a diverse pr ofession trained in schools with different philosophies and techniques. Similarly, there are several styles of acupuncture using different techniques, and the location of specific recommended acupuncture points by students and experts can be highly vari- able (Aird, Cobbin, & Rogers, 2002; Kaptchuk, 2002a). Likewise, can be \"unicists\"(one remedy at a time) or \"pluralists\" (several remedies at a time). Despite these variabilities, reliability of clinical assessment can be achieved. In an obser- vational study, for example, nine Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners agreed on a specificTCM diagnosis in just over 80 percent of visits made by 23 women with menopausal symptoms (Zell, et al., 2000). synergistic interventions Complementary and alternative therapies are usually administered multiply, involving com- bined herbs or the serial or combined use of seve ral remedies or modalities; they also oftenASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20049 involve a particular, holistically oriented way of caring for and advising the patient. The question then is, \"Which specific activity provides the benefit or do the different modalities interact witheach other in some way?\" The answer appears to be that the synergy of multiple remedies is a key part of the healing process. In the area of herbal remedies, for example, there is evidence that \"buffering\"(reducing toxicity) and synergy of whole plant products may have more useful treatment effects than processed biological extracts. Treatment with a single type of ginseng is less efficacious inproducing vasodilation than a combination of types of ginseng; berberine's effect (antibacterial) isenhanced six-fold by & Zollman, 1999; Spinella, 2002). Simi-lar enhancing combinations are found in conventional medicine, as with amoxicillin/clavulanicacid (McCormack & Keating, 2005) and combined anti-cancer protocols (Hayes, 2004; Nagourney,Link, Blitzer, Forsthoff, & Evans, 2000). This synergy is found in foods as well, which are also often a part of conventional thera- peutics. For example, whole grains, in combination, have an independent effect in preventingcardiac disease compared to the use of separate elements of the grains (Anderson, 2003; Slavin,2003). In another instance, the LDL cholesterol-lowering effect increases from processed olive oil, to virgin olive oil (first cold pressing), to the whole oli ve (Faine, et al., 2004; Ramirez-Tortosa, et al., 1999). product variability in CAMCAMCAMCAMCAM studies Another complicating factor in studying outcomes of herbal medicine is the bioavailability of herbs and nutritional supplements used in clinical trials. For example, ratios of therapeuticfractions vary from one product to another (fish oil EPA:DHA ratios is one example). Compari-sons of outcome studies may be unreliable because the herb differed in some qualitative way\u2014perhaps it was harvested at a different time. The variability of product quality is substantial. Forexample, one survey found the following variations: ephedra 0-154 percent of label claim; ginseng 10-fold variation in ginsenosides; yohimbine, none of 26 products contained an effective dose(\"Herbal Roulette,\" 1995). Any valid study of efficacy or effectiveness of herbals must use a wellstandardized product with a clear indication of its processing, purity, and bioavailability. control groups in CAMCAMCAMCAMCAM studies It often is difficult to design a study using the conventional model of a blind \"control\" group that receives a sham or placebo remedy. How does one administer \"fake\" acupuncture,\"non-massage,\" or a fake magnet? The patient expectancy bias towards the alternative therapy alsomay be a problem in recruiting subjects (Kirsch, 1999). Those interested in participating mayalready be strongly biased toward the CAM modality under investigation and may not accept thepossibility of a sham treatment. Many also will have tried conventional care with little improve-ment and may not want to participate in a trial comparing conventional therapy with an alternativeif it means the chance of receiving conventional care again (Lewith, Walach, et al., 2002). Finally, if the placebo effect is very substantial, it may dominate the effect of an active treatment. This phenomenon may occur in modalities where the clinician's approach or relationshipto the patient is a key element of treatment. Attempting to exclude this factor from the design ofthe research may negate what may be an essential part of providing care. It is not always themodality that makes this placebo effect important. Patients may respond better to treatments ad-THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200410 ministered by people with whom they feel safe or otherwise share ameaningful connection. desired outcomes & \"un-measurable\" factors Many complementary and alternative medical practitionersshare similar beliefs about health andhealing ( see box, left ). These principles form the foundation for the varioustherapies and techniques employed,and are fundamental to healing. Theyconcern desired outcomes and theprocesses of health and healingrather than specific therapies or pro-tocols. Despite their central impor-tance to CAM treatments, there cur-rently are almost no testable mea-sures of these principles (Long,2002). Often in complementary and alternative medicine, desiredoutcomes involve coping, adapta-tion, functioning, and feeling at ease.These factors have meaning for pa-tients and are currently measurableonly subjectively, although newtools\u2014such as the measurement ofheart rate variability\u2014may be use-ful in confirming subjective self-re-ported data. There are few measuresthat simultaneously address the self-healing effect, the therapeutic rela-tionship effect, and the complemen-tary modality. Therefore, to fully as-sess efficacy or effectiveness, addi-tional measurements are necessarybeyond the usual physiological indi-cators (e.g., range of motion or se- rum cholesterol) used in conventional medicine. Examples of measurement instruments that canassist in providing a more realistic assessment of the efficacy or effectiveness of complementaryand alternative medicine are: global improv ement scales (Streiner & Norman, 1995; Paterson & Britten, 2000), the Empathy Scale (Burns & Auerbach, 1996); and the Holistic Practice Question-naire (Long, Mercer, & Hughes, 2000).PRINCIPLES OF HEALING EMPHASIZED IN MANY COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES While a disparate array of alternative therapies and healing systems fall under the umbrella term\"CAM,\" what they typically have in common are fundamental principles of health and healing.These principles are not unique to CAM (conventional medicine subscribes to some), nor do allCAM therapies embrace them equally. Taken together, however, they provide a framework forunderstanding CAM approaches to healing that contrast with the biomedical model of care. ManyCAM therapeutic systems emphasize some or all of the following principles to a greater degreethan conventional medicine. Effective integration of CAM and conventional care must rest onacknowledgment, appreciation, and application of these principles in a patient-centered context.

Ideally we would seek to prevent illness,promote health, and reduce health costs. Economically, the medical-industrial complex seeks in-novation and clinical effectiveness that is tied to f inancial rewards for industry. CAM, by use of natural products and low-cost approaches, does not attract the kind of investment and resourcesthat would deliver substantial research into effectiveness. attitudes about the effectiveness of CAMCAMCAMCAMCAM Perceptions of efficacy are also an issue in the debate over the effectiveness of comple- mentary and alternative therapies. Conventional practitioners' opinions can be based not only onresearch findings (of variable quality), but also on numerous cultural, emotional, and personalinfluences and on professional bias and experience. These additional factors may either minimizeor promote research findings. For example, a meta-analysis of 12 studies of attitudes toward comple-mentary and alternative medicine showed that, despite a paucity of studies of the efficacy ofcomplementary medicine, conventional practitioners believed that many of these therapies wereindeed moderately effective (Ernst, Resch, & White, 1995). People working in complementary medicine quite reasonably suggest that long experi- ence by clinicians and patients using certain therapies or healing systems\u2014often over hundreds ofyears\u2014provides valid historical evidence of eff ectiveness. Conventional medicine's expectation is that this long clinical experience would translate into a few well-honed therapies for a particularproblem. In actuality, the extensive historical e xperience of many complementary and alternative healing practices has produced not a few but a great variety of treatments for specific problems. A review of several CAM textbooks, for example, identified 65 different therapies for asthma (Ernst,2001). For the study's authors, this range of ther apies suggests that many years of experience have not necessarily clarified clinical efficacy and that historical evidence may not be relied upon to demonstrate effectiveness. A contrasting perspective is that there are many different scientifically unproven therapies that do work for \"asthma,\" perhaps operating through different mechanisms.For example, therapies may differ in their effect on patients with asthma because of individualgenetic differences in responding to the therapy or because of individual differences in the causa-tion of the asthma. efficacy & effectiveness of complementary medical modalities: systematic reviews & meta-analyses Demonstrating the outcomes of complementary and alternative therapies from the perspective of mainstream medicine usually centers around five questions: Is there biological evidence to support the mechanism of action of the modalityunder study? Does the diagnostic approach of the modality coincide with the biomedical diagnos-tic process? Are the data obtained in studying a complementary/alternative modality free of bias? Is the study designed, implemented, and interpr eted in a rigorous fashion? Can the therapy be effective in real world populations?THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200412 Following are three examples of different resear ch approaches to effectiveness in complementary and alternative therapies that relate to the above questions and will give the reader a taste of thechallenges facing this new field of medical care. EXAMPLE 1EXAMPLE 1EXAMPLE 1EXAMPLE 1EXAMPLE 1: a review of the rationale , mechanism, efficacy, and effectiveness of craniosacral therapy for various clinical problems (Green, et al., 1999) Craniosacral therapy (CST), a modality developed in the 20th century, is used by chiropractic, osteopathic, and naturopathic ph ysicians, massage therapists, and dentists for headaches, migraines, insomnia, injury, sinusitis, learning difficulties, and the results of birth trauma. The rationale supporting craniosacral therapy is that there is some dysfunction in the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that c auses or contributes to specific clinical problems, and that the restriction of cranial bone movement may be responsible. Furthermore, r hythmic movement of the cranial bones and the vertical spine by the therapist can help restore normal CSF flow and relieve symptoms. The review, by the Office of Health Technology Assessment in British Columbia, Canada, covered a series of questions about the effectiveness of craniosacral therapy (CSF). The questions and conclusions are shown below.

Movement of cranial bones occurs but is slight (contrary to conventional teaching that there is no motion). No evidence has been established that different cranial bone positions produce changes in CSF flow or that changed CSF flow lea ds to symptoms.

Inter-observer agreement between practitioners of craniosacral therapy is weak question: Is craniosacral treatment effective? (7 studies reviewed) These studies were mostly case reports, retrospective case series, pre- and post-intervention studies, all of poor quality. None showed convincing evidence of the benefit of craniosacral therapy. conclusionsconclusionsconclusionsconclusionsconclusions Craniosacral therapy is currently not supported by evidence of efficacy. Once there is more clarity regarding standards of diag nosis, and different measures of craniosacral motion have been established, well-designed, randomized controlled studies might confirmeffectiveness. But is RCT design a good fit for CST? It would be difficult to avoid quality problems inherent to RCT. As noted before, other methodologies, such as case series, may be better suited.ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200413 EXAMPLE 2EXAMPLE 2EXAMPLE 2EXAMPLE 2EXAMPLE 2: do certain countries produce only positive results? a systematic review of controlled trials (Vickers, Goyal, Harland & Rees, 1998; Bandolier, 2000) This study addressed the issue of possible national bias in publishing results of efficacy studies on complementary and alterna tive therapies, since a majority have been done outside the US and UK.

A search was performed for randomized controlled trials of acupuncture vs control or placebo interventions in the previous 30 y ears. For each of the over 160 studies, reviewers were blinded to the country of origin. The outcome assessed was the superiority of acupuncture over the control/placebo. When the countries with 100 percent of their acupuncture trials showing superiority over control/placebo were compared to the U nited Kingdom in terms of conventional medical RCTs not involving acupuncture, the following data were obtained: RESULTSRESULTSRESULTSRESULTSRESULTS region region region region region % of trials showing superiority of% of trials showing superiority of% of trials showing superiority of% of trials showing superiority of% of trials showing superiority of acupuncture over control/placeboacupuncture over control/placeboacupuncture over control/placeboacupuncture over % East 100 % # 40 95% 6 100% CONCLUSIONCONCLUSIONCONCLUSIONCONCLUSIONCONCLUSION There seems to be a clear pattern of consistently positive results for all RCTs in certain countries, which suggests that subst antial bias or error in study design or reporting exists. In general, one would expect the outcomes of acupuncture treatment to be very similar acro ss countries. The authors of the two reviews mentioned at the beginning point out that one high-quality study was far more useful in establishing efficacy or effectiveness than large numbers of poorly designed clinical trials, implying that most were of questionable quality.THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200414 summary In conventional as well as complementary and alternative medicine, the effectiveness of a treat- ment protocol is determined by multiple factors, not limited to the efficacy of a specific interven-tion. Nonetheless, despite the multi-dimensional nature of effectiveness assessments, conven-tional medical practice relies primarily on evidence of efficacy from highly focused, randomizedcontrolled clinical trials to inform clinical decisions. Today's health care system includes a wide variety of complementary and alternative heal- ing modalities that are employed by nearly half the population. The conventional practitioner ischallenged to make informed clinical decisions a bout the use of complementary and alternative therapies and to provide information and counsel to his or her patients about these therapies. The overwhelming reliance on a single resear ch methodology to inform the clinician poses significant problems in testing the outcomes of CAM. RCT study designs do not serve wellin evaluating healing systems that are individualized, multi-faceted, and synergistic. Additionally, the numbers of good studies available\u2014while growing\u2014are still small. The challenge to researchers is to find mor e varied and appropriate ways of studying the effectiveness of complementary and alternative therapies, and to make this information readilyaccessible to clinicians despite economic, cultural, and political obstacles. The challenge to practi-tioners is to broaden their clinical decision-making processes by accessing appropriate informa-tion about complementary therapies and not relying only on RCT data in making treatment deci-sions.EXAMPLE 3EXAMPLE 3EXAMPLE 3EXAMPLE 3EXAMPLE 3: the efficacy and effectiveness of a specific herbal preparation for a specific illness: the use of ginkgo biloba extract for peripheral vascular disease (Pittler & Ernst, 2000) Intermittent claudication describes ischemic pain felt in the legs as a result of reduced blood flow. It is a chronic problem, limiting function, and is caused by narrowing of the arteries to the legs, usually atherosclerosis. Ginkgo extract has a biological activity on platelets and cl otting factors that improves blood flow.
