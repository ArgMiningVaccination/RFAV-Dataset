Although naturopathic medicine has been a part of the American health care system for over 100 years, its philosophy and roots go back through medical history to the healing wisdom of many other cultures and times dating back thousands of years. Today, naturopathic medicine skillfully blends all of the modern, cutting-edge elements of conventional medicine with the ancient, time-honored natural healing techniques that have been used for centuries. In the past few decades, naturopathic medicine has experienced a large resurgence in the United States due to the health conscious public taking a more active role in their health care and seeking out alternatives to the failing conventional medical system in this country. People are demanding to be seen as whole persons, not as a list of symptoms. People want time and honesty from their physicians. They want to be empowered and have more control over their own health. They want preventative therapies...not suppressive quick fixes. Naturopathic medicine provides these things...and Dr. Strand, as a Naturopathic Physician, believes these to be the foundation of building healing relationships with her patients. Naturopathic Medical Doctors (ND's or NMD's) are trained as primary care providers and are the only general practitioners trained as specialists in natural medicine. Naturopathic physicians are trained in a four-year medical school and are required to pass comprehensive national licensing exams (NPLEX) in order to be licensed. Once licensed, we are able to diagnose and treat any medical condition, whether acute or chronic. In practice, NMD's perform and use the same diagnostic tools as allopathic medical doctors (MD's), exams; etc. We work closely with all other branches of medicine, referring patients to other qualified practitioners/specialists for diagnosis and/or treatment when appropriate. NMD's differ from conventional physicians in our philosophy of treatment and our treatment modalities. We address the cause of disease rather than just suppress symptoms; we treat the whole person, not just the parts; and we respect nature and work with your body's own innate ability to heal itself. We promote prevention of illness and we teach you how to achieve your optimal level of health. Depending on the person and the condition being treated, each treatment is unique and individualized...providing the best opportunity for the health and growth of that person. When you see Dr. Strand as your naturopathic doctor, she will honor you as a unique individual and involve you as an active participant in your health. She will spend significant time with you - usually 60-75 minutes - during your initial consultation. She will listen to you so you can share your health story and really be heard. She will answer all of the questions that you have, and ask you a ton of questions of her own. Dr. Strand believes that you know your body better than anyone will ever know your body, so she values your input and uses it to help guide her in her recommendations to you. Although Naturopathic Doctors are licensed to prescribe conventional prescription medicines, we typically choose not to use surgery and/or prescription medications unless it is absolutely necessary. Instead, naturopathic physicians offer safe and effective natural alternatives to these conventional therapies, which include: We, at Creative Healing Solutions in Scottsdale AZ, offer a comprehensive approach to health...one that focuses on the mind, body and spirit.
