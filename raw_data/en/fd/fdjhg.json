Individuals and organizations interested in quality care for patients with rheumatic disease are encouraged to review the information on this page and provide input into ACR guideline activities. About ACR Clinical Practice Guidelines Clinical practice guidelines and recommendations are developed to: - Reduce inappropriate care - Minimize geographic variations in practice patterns - Enable effective use of health care resources Guidelines and recommendations developed and/or endorsed by the ACR are intended to provide guidance for patterns of practice and not to dictate the care of a particular patient. The ACR considers adherence to these guidelines and recommendations to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the clinician in light of each patient's individual circumstances. Guidelines and recommendations are intended to promote beneficial or desirable outcomes but cannot guarantee any specific outcome. Guidelines and recommendations developed and/or endorsed by the ACR are subject to periodic revision as warranted by the evolution of medical knowledge, technology, and practice.

Patient Involvement Patients are active participants in ACR guideline development. For each guideline, a Patient Panel is convened and provides input just before the Voting Panel meets to decide the guideline recommendations. At least two patients from the Patient Panel sit on the Voting Panel, tasked with sharing patient perspectives during the discussions and decision-making. Learn more about the ACR's initial pilot project to test its current process for patient involvement in guideline work.
