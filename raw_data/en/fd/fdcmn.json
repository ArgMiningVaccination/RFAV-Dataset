OData helps you focus on your business logic while building RESTful APIs without having to worry about the various approaches to define request and response headers, status codes, HTTP methods, URL conventions, media types, payload formats, query options, etc. OData also provides guidance for tracking changes, defining functions/actions for reusable procedures, and sending asynchronous/batch requests. OData RESTful APIs are easy to consume. The OData metadata, a machine-readable description of the data model of the APIs, enables the creation of powerful generic client proxies and tools. Tools | | | | Resources [ Getting Started ](/getting-started/) To get started, take a look at [Understanding OData in 6 steps](/getting-started/understand-odata-in-6-steps/). Tutorial](/getting-started/advanced-tutorial/) and learn OData. [Standard](/documentation/) [Libraries](/libraries/) There are several of libraries to facilitate building and consuming OData service. [Restier](https://odata.github.io/RESTier/) is the main library for .NET framework. [Apache Olingo](https://olingo.apache.org/) is for Java platform to build OData service. [Sample Services](https://www.odata.org/odata-services/) There are several OData sample services to help you practice with OData API. [TripPin Service](https://services.odata.org/TripPinRESTierService/) is the main sample service. "}
