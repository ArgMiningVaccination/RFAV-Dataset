He derived his [epistemology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology) from [Johann Wolfgang von Goethe](/archives/2008/06/02/johann-wolfgang-von-goethe-and-homeopathy/)'s world view, where: \"Thinking... is no more and no less an organ of perception than the eye or ear. Just as the eye perceives colours and the ear sounds, so thinking perceives ideas.\" [Rudolf Steiner established a nursery school system, of which 875 schools exist today, 27 of which are in the United Kingdom](http://www.herefordwaldorfschool.org/Joomla/content/blogcategory/19/134/). [Steiner's homeopathic medicine and art of natural healing, and the natural scientific and ecological teaching dispensed in the Steiner schools], are based on this primeval, pre-modern theory of a cosmos in which all things are one. [Anthroposophical medicine], which generally refers to [Weleda homeopathic preparations], was also developed by Rudolf Steiner. Biodynamic agriculture has its basis in a spiritual world-view known as [anthroposophy]as propounded by founder [Rudolf Steiner]... All preparations are thus used in [homeopathic]quantities. [Steiner's homeopathic medicine and art of natural healing, and the natural scientific and ecological teaching dispensed in the Steiner schools], are based on this primeval, pre-modern theory of a cosmos in which all things are one.

Steiner put his homeopathic remedy in a bucket of water and 'flicked it like a fine rain into the wind'. Steiner explained that creatures throughout the World would slowly build up a resistance to the allopathic poisons at present in use. [Within three days, all of the rabbits on the estate had fled towards the distant wastelands and marshes](http://books.google.com/books?id=BKt_4HbED6AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=ravenscroft+spear+of+destiny&ei=4KxrSM6ACqXmtgPtqZT_CA&sig=ACfU3U0gUykKiXajljZyyovzat_DWsb4SA) and rabbits were rarely seen on the estate for years to come. Rudolf Steiner was particularly interested in the use of homeopathy for the treatment of the environment [and bees](http://books.google.com/books?id=YBfDWI_1W2EC&pg=PA37&dq=rudolf+steiner+homeopath&lr=&ei=YMdrSNj2KYPijgGgoPDfAg&sig=ACfU3U3fZnLsM-5yQiyLlcEZu4u2m_gmSg), as well as using [homeopathy directly as human medicine](http://books.google.com/books?id=YBfDWI_1W2EC&pg=PA37&dq=rudolf+steiner+homeopath&lr=&ei=YMdrSNj2KYPijgGgoPDfAg&sig=ACfU3U3fZnLsM-5yQiyLlcEZu4u2m_gmSg#PPA39,M1).

In 1921, Dr. [Ita Wegman]opened the first anthroposophic medical clinic, now [Ita Wegman Clinic], in [Arlesheim], [Switzerland]. [Ita Wegman]was soon joined by a number of other doctors. They began to train the first anthroposophic nurses for the clinic. At [Ita Wegman]'s request, Steiner regularly visited the clinic and suggested treatment regimes for particular patients. Between 1921 and 1925, he also gave several series of lectures on medicine. In 1925, [Ita Wegman]and Steiner wrote the first book on the anthroposophic approach to medicine, [Fundamentals of Therapy]... [Anthroposophical Medicine]approaches disease as an imbalance in the biological organism and employs treatment strategies intended to restore this balance. Anthroposophical approaches include [Anthroposophical Medicine]based upon modified [homeopathic]principles, physical therapies including [massage therapy]and [artistic]therapies. Many of these are intended to support the patient's capacity for self-healing. From [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Steiner] [From 1879 graduated]from Hochschule](Technical University) in where he [physics], and [philosophy]. In 1882, one of Steiner's teachers at the university in Vienna, [Karl Julius Schr\u00f6er], suggested Steiner's name to [Professor Joseph K\u00fcrschner], editor of a new edition of [Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]'s works. Steiner was then asked to become the edition's scientific editor. In his autobiography, Steiner related that at 21, on the train between his home village and [Vienna], he met a simple herb gatherer, [Felix Kogutski], who spoke about the spiritual world: \"as someone who had his own experiences of it...\" This herb gatherer introduced Steiner to a person that Steiner only identified as a \"master\", and who had a great influence on Steiner's subsequent development, in particular directing him to study [Fichte's]philosophy. In 1891 Steiner earned a doctorate in philosophy at the University of Rostock in Germany with a thesis based upon Fichte's concept of the ego, later published in expanded form as Truth and Knowledge... In 1896 [Elisabeth Forster Nietzsche]asked Steiner to set the [Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche]archive in Naumburg in order. Her brother by that time was no longer [compos mentis]. [Elisabeth Forster Nietzsche]introduced Steiner into the presence of the catatonic philosopher and Steiner, deeply moved, subsequently wrote the book [Friedrich Nietzsche, Fighter for Freedom]. Of [Friedrich Wilhelm in his [Friedrich Nietzsche]'s ideas of the 'eternal repetition' and of 'supermen' remained long in my mind. For in these was reflected that which a personality must feel concerning the evolution and essential being of humanity when this personality is kept back from grasping the spiritual world by the restricted thought in the philosophy of nature characterizing the end of the nineteenth century.\" \"What attracted me particularly was that one could read [Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche]without coming upon anything which strove to make the reader a 'dependent' of [Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche]'s'.\"... A turning point came in 1899, when Steiner decided to publish an article in the [Magazin f\u00fcr Literatur], titled \" [Goethe's Secret Revelation]\", on the esoteric nature of [Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]'s fairy tale, [The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily]. This article led to an invitation by the [Count and Countess Brockdorff]to speak to a gathering of Theosophists on the subject of [Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche]. Steiner continued speaking regularly to the members of the [Theosophical Society], becoming the head of its newly constituted German section in 1902, though without ever joining the society. It was within this society that Steiner met and worked with [Marie von Sievers], who eventually became his second wife (1914). By 1904, Steiner was appointed by [Annie Wood Besant]to be leader of the Esoteric Society for Germany and Austria. The German Section of the [Theosophical Society]grew rapidly under Steiner's leadership as he lectured throughout much of Europe on his [spiritual science]. During this period Steiner maintained an original approach, replacing [Madame Blavatsky's]terminology with his own, and basing his spiritual research and teachings upon the Western esoteric and philosophical tradition. This and other differences, in particular the pronouncement by [C. W. Leadbeater]and [Annie Wood Besant]that [Jiddu Krishnamurti]was the vehicle of a new world teacher, and the reincarnation of Christ, claims Steiner publicly rejected, led to a formal split in 1912... From his decision to \"go public\" in 1899 until his death in 1925, Steiner articulated an ongoing stream of experiences that he claimed were of the spiritual world \u2014 experiences he said had touched him from an early age on. Steiner aimed to apply his training in [mathematics], [science], and [philosophy]to produce rigorous, verifiable presentations of those experiences. Steiner believed that through freely chosen [ethical]disciplines and [meditative training], anyone could develop the ability to experience the [spiritual world], including the higher nature of oneself and others. Steiner believed that such [discipline]and training would help a person to become a more [moral], [creative]and [free] [individual]- free in the sense of being capable of actions motivated solely by [love]. Steiner's ideas about the inner life were influenced by [Frantz Brentano] - with whom he had studied - and [Wilhelm Dilthey], founders of the [phenomenological]movement in European philosophy. Steiner was also influenced by [Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]'s [phenomenological approach to science]. Steiner's collected works include about 40 volumes of his writings and more than 300 volumes of lectures. The [Anthroposophical Society]grew rapidly. Fueled by a need to find a home for their yearly conferences, which included performances of plays written by [Eduard Schur\u00e9]as well as Steiner himself, the decision was made to build a theater and organizational center. In 1913, construction began on the first [Goetheanum]building, in [Dornach], [Switzerland]. The building, designed by Steiner, was built to significant part by volunteers who offered craftsmanship or simply a will to learn new skills. Once [World War I]started in 1914, the [Goetheanum]volunteers could hear the sound of cannon fire beyond the Swiss border, but despite the war, people from all over Europe worked peaceably side by side on the building's construction. In 1919, the [Goetheanum]staged the world premiere of a complete production of [Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]'s [Faust]. In this same year, the first [Waldorf school]was founded in [Stuttgart], Germany. (Where Walter Johannes Stein lectured frequently) Beginning in 1919, Steiner was called upon to assist with numerous practical activities. His lecture activity expanded enormously. At the same time, the [Goetheanum]developed as a wide-ranging cultural centre. On New Year's Eve, 1923, it was burned down by arson; only his massive sculpture depicting the spiritual forces active in the world and the human being, the [Representative of Humanity], was saved. Steiner immediately began work designing a [second Goetheanum]building - made of concrete instead of wood - which was completed in 1928, three years after his death. During the [Anthroposophical Society's] [Christmas Conference]in 1923, Steiner founded the [School of Spiritual Science], intended as an open university for research and study. This university, which has various sections or faculties, has grown steadily; it is particularly active today in the fields of [education], [medicine], [agriculture], art, natural science, literature, philosophy, sociology and economics. Steiner spoke of laying the foundation stone of the new society in the hearts of his listeners, while the First [Goetheanum]'s foundation stone had been laid in the earth. He gave a [Foundation Stone meditation]to anchor this. The arson had a context. Threats had been made publicly against the [Goetheanum], and against Steiner himself by right-wing nationalists. Reacting to the catastrophic situation in post-war Germany, Steiner had gone on extensive lecture tours promoting his social ideas of the [Threefold Social Order], entailing a fundamentally different political structure; he suggested that only through independence of the cultural, political and economic realms could such catastrophes as the World War be avoided. Steiner also promoted a radical solution in the disputed area of [Upper Silesia]- claimed by both [Poland]and [Germany]: his suggestion that this area be granted at least provisional independence led to his being publicly accused of being a traitor to Germany. In 1919, the political theorist of the [National Socialist]movement in Germany, [Dietrich Eckart], attacked Steiner and suggested he was a Jew. In 1921, [Adolf Hitler]attacked Steiner in an article in the right-wing \" [V\u00f6lkischen Beobachter]\" newspaper, including accusations that Steiner was a tool of the [Jews], and other nationalist extremists in Germany were calling up a \"war against Steiner\". The 1923 [Beer Hall Putsch]in Munich led Steiner to give up his residence in Berlin, saying that if those responsible for the attempted coup [Hitler and others] came to power in Germany, it would no longer be possible for him to enter the country; he also warned against the disastrous effects it would have for Central Europe if the National Socialists came to power. The loss of the [Goetheanum]affected Steiner's health seriously. From 1923 on, he showed signs of increasing frailness and illness. He continued to lecture widely, and even to travel; especially towards the end of this time, he was often giving two, three or even four lectures daily for courses taking place concurrently. On the one hand, many of these were for practical areas of life: education, curative eurythmy, speech and drama. On the other hand, Steiner began a new, extensive series of lectures presenting his research on the successive lives of various individuals, and on the technique of karma research generally. By autumn, 1924, however, he was too weak to continue; his last lecture was held in September of that year. He died on March 30, 1925. "}
