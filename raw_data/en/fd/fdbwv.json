When choosing a form of treatment for boosting the immune system, it is important to understand the differences between allopathic and natural supplements. Health experts reveal what works better in boosting a stronger immune system - natural supplements or allopathy The discussion on whether natural remedies or man-made remedies are the superior option to cure ailment, has been ongoing for a considerable amount of time and although [natural supplements](https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/food-supplement) have been our primary choice for treating the body for centuries, the emergence of a modern [lifestyle](https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle) has caused allopathic medicine to become increasingly popular due to its speedy effects.

In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Sanjay Kalra, DM (AIIMS), President-elect at SAFES, Bharti Hospital, explained, \"Allopathic medicines are designed to treat specific illnesses and may not be the best choice for boosting the immune system as they can have serious side effects.

As these foods are rich in antioxidants and help gain energy for day-to-day activities, they should be included in your child's diet. Proteins are also a must when on the lookout to boost immunity. Proteins are frequently referred to as the building blocks required for cell and tissue repair.
