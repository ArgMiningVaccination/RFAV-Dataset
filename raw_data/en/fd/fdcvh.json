Transformational is still a strong style, but added to this is a new genre of leadership including esthetic, ethical and spiritual. These are targeted towards morals and values and can be used in effort to inspire followers to be actively engaged in the company and go beyond the needs of their employment. Theorist argue that \"these contemporary theories fill gaps in the leadership literature by expanding into areas of emotions, inspiration, and morality.\" (Spector, 2014) We can expect for the qualities that define a strong, positive leader to continue evolving. Moreover, several studies have been conducted to examine the effects of low nurse staffing on patients hospitalization experiences, as well as its effect on nurse careers in the long run. A recent study by Frith, Anderson, Tseng, and Fong (2012) to explore the relationship between nurse staffing and medication errors, demonstrated that medication errors were higher in a cardiac care unit and non-cardiac care unit when staffing levels were lower. In addition, Frith et al. (2012) pointed out that medication errors increase by 18% for every 20% decrease in nurse staffing below the average due to failure to follow medication administration protocol As mentioned earlier, nurses perform the last and the most important step of medication administration. Thus, having adequate time to assess each patient efficiently and following the medication rights is critical to provide safe patient care and prevent errors. In some cultures there are companies who rely on the chain of command concept. This concept can also be referred to as having a hierarchy which is an organization in which people or groups are ranked one about the other according to authority. The chosen manager is one level ahead of their employees. In this type of atmosphere employees are under watch and rule of the manager whom was delegated by someone further up the ladder. Because the manager has the authority in this type of culture, there is a certain way an employee must discuss or present information regarding the organization as well as personally. In response to hospitals being under staffed with nurses, Theresa Brown argues that hospitals must have a sufficiently large nursing staff in her article \"When No One Is on Call\". She effectively builds her argument by using personal anecdotes and statistics. Culture: The culture of an organisation can be part of keeping employees engaged and making the company differ positively from competitors. For example some organisations collaborative or friendly and seek employee inputs, flexible working hours to drive engagement from employees and bonus, which will result in attracting new talent. When passing patient information and responsibility between emergency department nurses and ward nurses, there are times when it can become inefficient due to inadequate communication (Drach-Zahavy, Goldblatt & Maizel 2015). Clinical handover is a universal procedure used by all nurses from all around the world in the hopes of promoting consistency of care. (Johnson, Jefferies & Nicholls 2012). As patients with continual care need multiple assessments, nurses take notes during all procedures accomplished and pass them down to incoming nurses at the end of their shift. If nurses are unable to perform certain tasks, it is essential that nurses from incoming shifts be able to perform them. The basic handover consists of the patient's ailment, vital signs, bowel movements, nutritional intake and other need-to-know basis doctors or nurses from other shifts would use in order to assess the patient properly. No matter how major or minor, poor communication can In a world that is so diverse, we get to interact with so many people from different cultural background. But, even though we have different family cultures, we adjust most of the time for work. Every workplace has their own culture of which we abide to provide for our families. Management creates their own values and practices for us to follow and anything outside of that is considered an objection which might be unethical and cause us our jobs. To function effectively as an organization, we all must work as a team. The cultural context of the workplace is that management have a high expectation; they want employees to act, have great synergy, and give great results. Organizational culture is the foundation for organizations to strive and maintain success. Its structure of standards, include planning of human resources, management, health and safety, and the like. Organizations depend on these tactics to gain revenue, marketing strategies, and satisfaction of employees, and build relationships. Management should also be involved to create positive work environments, demonstrate great attitudes, and effective communication to its employees. For the last 3 years I have worked in an acute care hospital, on the night-shift as a nurse in the labor and delivery unit. This is a 16 room labor and delivery bed unit that also houses 4 additional triage bays, a full time nursery, and a fully functional operating room This labor and delivery department runs as a 24hour, 7day a week unit with each nurse having to take at least 16 hours a month of call on days, evenings, or weekends. This is a very fast-paced unit, which carries a heavy load of responsibility and stress. Labor is unpredictable with that you never know what your patient load may be from day to day. This is an area that requires knowledgeable and multi certified/trained nurses that are always on their toes and have the ability to adapt and react to emergencies without hesitation. This department serves for 7 local obstetricians that service numerous obstetric patients. The unit runs off a weekly schedule book that is filled with routine inductions, scheduled c-sections, on top of all the daily triage patients, that can soon turn into labor admissions. The nurses on this unit are Smithsville Area Aging Office is in a state of emergency. It's federal, and state funding has been frozen, pending investigation of legal action filed against the agency, its staff, and its Board of Directors. The legal action pending is a class action suit brought against Smithsville Area Agency by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Smithsville Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual/Transgender Coalition. The agency has refused to deliver services to gays/lesbians/bisexuals/transgenders. The agency must close its doors because it solely relied on federal and state funding to operate its services. The company will be closed pending investigation and throughout the litigation process unless another avenue of revenue can be identified and accessed. The type of model of nursing care delivery used on my unit is a team nursing model. I am currently working on a 50-bed orthopedic unit in a level one trauma center. The unit is divided into 2 areas. One of the sides is for trauma patients and the other one is for elective surgical patients. One nurse assumes the charge nurse duties, including making staff assignments, managing call-outs, communicating with the patient care coordinator, and supervises problems and concerns for both areas of the unit. There are also multiple nurses on the unit, and each nurse is assigned about 5 or 6 patients for each shift. In team nursing, the medications are given by one nurse while baths, vital signs, and lab works are provided by a nursing assistant (NA). Organizational behavior is the study and application of knowledge about how people, as individuals and as groups, act with in organizations. An organization's behavior will correlate their effectiveness with task achievement and it's understanding of organization behavior is crucial in determining how to improve productivity. The human behavior can influence a company either negatively or positively depending on the company and the way they interact with employees and how the employees feel they are treated. Large patient loads combined with a stressful work environment affects nurses' abilities to provide quality healthcare. Patient safety should never be compromised. It is our responsibility to learn from research and improve our current nurse staffing ratios. Nurse staffing is key and affects all other outcomes. Without nurses administering the right treatment at the right time to the right patients, all other healthcare interventions are not effective. Improvement of nurse staffing levels will improve the quality of care our patients receive. Nurses play an essential role in the healthcare industry. The nurse workforce is made up of licensed nurses: registered nurses (RNs), licensed vocational nurses (LVNs) and licensed practical nurses (LPNs), along with nurse aides. Registered nurses are responsible for assessments of patients' needs, development of care plans, medication administration, and treatments, while licensed vocational nurses perform specific care under the delegation of the registered nurses and supervisions. Nursing aides perform activities of daily living (unskilled attention) to the patient. Adequate nursing staffing is essential to both patient care and outcomes, also to the retention of nurses while inadequate staffing creates problems for both the patients and Organizational culture differs from a company to another, depending on the nature of work. Frequently, a remarkable diverse combination of qualities and standards, administer the cultural environment of an organization. A system of common meaning held by associates that differentiates the organization from other organizations is what we mean by organizational culture. In today 's quickly changing business atmosphere, the cultural make-up of an organization perform a decisive role the achievements of the organization to accomplish its vital targets.
