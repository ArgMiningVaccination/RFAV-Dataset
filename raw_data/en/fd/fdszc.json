Health Tips for Parents \"Sleep-onset association, most common among infants and toddlers, is a behavioral disorder in which the child has learned to fall asleep only under specific bedtime conditions (e.g., while being rocked, cuddled or nursed),\" explains Iqbal Rashid, MD, UCLA pediatric pulmonologist and sleep medicine specialist. \"If the child wakes up during the night, he or she is often not able to fall back asleep ('self-soothe') unless those same conditions are available.\" In contrast, children experiencing limit- setting BIC explicitly refuse to go to bed or attempt to delay bedtime with persistent requests - asking for \"one more story\" or another trip to the bathroom. The third type of insomnia, combined BIC, occurs when a child exhibits both: reliance on a sleep aid and defiance around bedtime. Sleep is an integral part of a child's physiological health and development. \"To promote optimal health, children 3 to 5 years old need 10 to 13 hours of sleep per day and children six to 12 years old need nine to 12 hours of sleep per day,\" Dr. Rashid says. If your child is not getting enough sleep, talk to your pediatrician about treatment strategies. A BIC diagnosis is based on the child's symptoms and medical history. Factors that can cause or compound BIC include, but are not limited to, inconsistent bedtime routines and inadequate parental limit- setting, stress, caffeine, or co-existing medical disorders. \"While treatment may vary depending on the type and severity of the insomnia, most cases can be resolved with proper sleep hygiene practices that establish a regular sleep-wake cycle,\" Dr. Rashid says. Medications are not typically recommended as a first-line treatment for childhood insomnia; they are usually only used in special circumstances. Behavioral insomnia in children (BIC) Insomnia is a persistent difficulty with falling or staying asleep at night. BIC, which affects about 25 percent of children, is a type of pediatric insomnia that encompasses three behavioral disorders: sleep-onset association, limit-setting and combined BIC.

One of the biggest changes in current cholesterol management is a greater focus on collective heart-disease risk factors and not just good (high-density lipoprotein, or HDL) and bad (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL) cholesterol numbers. \"We no longer prescribe cholesterol-lowering medications, called statins, based solely on your cholesterol numbers,\" Dr. Imler says. The risk estimator developed by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association assesses the 10-year and lifetime risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), or heart attacks and strokes. In addition to cholesterol numbers, the calculator also considers age, gender, race and health history, such as tobacco use, diabetes and blood pressure. The score helps doctors identify those most at risk for potentially life-threatening heart events. You can assess your risk online or via the ASCVD Risk Estimator app. Consider medication. If results indicate that you are at high risk for heart problems, your doctor may recommend statins. Studies show that these medications are highly effective at lowering LDL, and they may reduce heart-attack risk by as much as 36 percent. Still, some people shy away from statins due to concerns about possible side effects. \"Often, symptoms can be alleviated by reducing the medication dose or frequency, and by adding an antioxidant supplement called Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) to relieve muscle aches,\" Dr. Imler says. Move more. Exercise is the best way to raise HDL, which clears the arteries of bad cholesterol. Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity five days a week, Dr. Imler says. In addition to boosting good cholesterol, exercise also helps you lose weight. Excess weight, especially a waist circumference of more than 40 inches for men or more than 35 inches for women, increases your likelihood of diabetes, another major heart disease risk factor. Switch up your diet. The foods you eat play a big role in your cholesterol numbers. \"It's more important to eat the right kinds of fat than to restrict fats,\" Dr. Imler says. She suggests cutting back on saturated fats, found in red meats and full-fat dairy products, and trans and saturated fats, found in fried foods, chips and crackers. Instead, eat more fish, soybeans, nuts and olive-oil products, which are high in heart-healthy polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. Talk to your doctor. \"Too often, people choose to forego medication in favor of lifestyle changes, but you jeopardize your health if those changes don't happen,\" says Cody Dashiell-Earp, MD, associate medical director of quality for the UCLA Department of Medicine. To help you succeed in making changes, or to determine your next steps, UCLA Health's new Healthy U preventive initiative reaches out to patients at high risk for heart problems. \"You might get a phone call or a message via my.UCLAhealth.org if a Healthy U staff member thinks you could benefit from a heart health discussion with your primary- care doctor,\" Dr. Dashiell-Earp says.When it comes to heart health, keeping an eye on your cholesterol levels is key. Unfortunately, many people remain confused about what's bad, what's good and what heart-protective actions to take. Erin Imler, MD, a UCLA family physician in Pacific Palisades, cuts through the cholesterol confusion.

Chang, MD, a UCLA family physician in Santa Monica. \"What we now understand from that study, and from subsequent research on the safety and role of HT, is that women can consider it for limited use to help with their menopausal symptoms, after a discussion with their physician to weigh any individual risks and to make sure that it is safe for them.\" Most women begin menopause in their late 40s or early 50s, although it can start earlier or later. Symptoms can last as long as several years, and they may include hot flashes, night sweats, sleep and mood disturbances, vaginal dryness and decreased sex drive. \"There is a wide range of severity,\" Dr. Chang says. \"Some women experience minimal symptoms, but for others, it can be very disruptive and debilitating.\"Menopausal hormone therapy addresses the decline in female hormone production that begins with menopause and contributes to the debilitating symptoms. Two types of oral medications are offered: estrogen and progestin (a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone) for most women, and estrogen alone for women who have had a hysterectomy. For women who have medical contraindications to HT, or who prefer not to use it, other prescription drugs have been shown to reduce hot flashes and associated symptoms. Although HT and some prescriptions offer stronger relief, many women report improvement in symptoms with herbal preparations and acupuncture. Prior to 2002, HT was used by many women for day-to-day menopausal symptoms and as a blanket therapy to reduce the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. The large Women's Health Initiative study showed that rather than stave off illness, oral HT increased the risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. The Women's Health Initiative continued to evaluate HT, and a new report in 2013 helped to spell out the risks. Dr. Chang explains that the combined oral estrogen/progestin therapy slightly increases the risk for heart disease, breast cancer and stroke, but the risk tends to be highest among women older than 60, which is typically past the age when most women are experiencing menopausal symptoms. Based on the latest knowledge, menopausal hormone therapy is an individual decision in which risk factors such as family history of breast cancer, heart attack and stroke are weighed against the severity of the symptoms. For women who decide not to use HT, lifestyle modifications can provide some relief for menopausal symptoms, Dr. Chang says. These include a well- balanced diet high in plant-based proteins and fruits and vegetables, regular exercise, reductions in caffeine and not smoking. Antidepressants may be prescribed for women experiencing mood disturbances, and lubricants can be offered for women having difficulty with vaginal dryness. While some women opt for so-called bioidentical hormones as a substitute for HT, Dr. Chang notes that there is not good evidence on the safety and efficacy of these drugs, which are hormones that are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as are HT and other prescription medications. \"The upshot is that the evidence no longer supports using HT on a long-term basis for prevention of disease risk,\" Dr. Chang says. \"But women who are experiencing a lot of difficulty with menopausal symptoms can consider using it to get through that stage, as long as their situation is evaluated on an individual basis.\"Based on the latest knowledge, menopausal hormone therapy is an individual decision in which risk factors such as family history of breast cancer, heart attack and stroke are weighed against the severity of the symptoms.

UCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631)Since it was founded in 2001, a state-funded program administered by UCLA has provided free high-quality prostate-cancer treatment to more than 2,200 California men with little or no health insurance. Beyond providing care to a population that might otherwise go without, IMPACT (Improving Access, Counseling & Treatment for Californians with Prostate Cancer) has boosted the health literacy and care of traditionally disenfranchised men by pairing them with a nurse case manager who assists with their care coordination and management. \"Our goal from the beginning was to bring treatment to this low-income, mostly minority population in their own communities in a way that is linguistically and culturally appropriate, while also empowering them to manage their prostate- cancer care, as well as other health issues that arise,\" says Mark S. Litwin, MD, MPH, chair of the UCLA Department of Urology and professor of public health and of nursing, and the program's founding director. \"These are men who tend to fall between the cracks in our healthcare system. Our safety net works well for emergency care, but if someone has a chronic disease and they don't have the wherewithal to advocate for themselves, they might not receive the care they need until their disease reaches an advanced state.\" Backed by more than $100 million in support from the California Department of Health Care Services since it began, IMPACT contracts with more than 600 healthcare providers up and down the state who treat patients enrolled in the program, as well as with mental-health professionals, local health departments, hospitals, outpatient facilities, pharmaceutical companies and others for the additional services patients need. A major part of the program is patient education \u2014 dozens of print and audio materials are available in English and Spanish, reaching a population that extends well beyond the patients who enroll. IMPACT also employs nurse case managers to work closely with patients to ensure that they know when to seek care, how to navigate the system to secure an appointment, and how to effectively communicate with providers about their needs, among other skills. \"Many of these men have a great deal of stress in their lives, and now, on top of UROLOGY Program for Underinsured Men with Shows Significant IMPACTProstate Cancer Vital Signs Summer 2017 Vol. 75 7 Continued from cov er Family Caregivers Need to Be Attentive to Their Needs, as Well as the Patient'sWELLNESS \"When a patient receives a diagnosis of cancer, the family gets the diagnosis, too,\" says Anne Coscarelli, PhD, director of the Simms/Mann-UCLA Center for Integrative Oncology, which helps patients and family members focus on wellness during cancer treatment and recovery. \"It's important to address their concerns, and to make sure that the health and well- being of the caregiver is maintained.\" Caregivers often are called on to perform wide-ranging tasks for their loved ones, Dr. Coscarelli notes. Depending on the condition of the patient, these can include assistance with activities of daily living, such as feeding, bathing and dressing, as well as household tasks, such as shopping for groceries, preparing meals, cleaning the home and doing laundry. They also might be asked to tend to legal responsibilities and issues of financial management, and may need to provide transportation to appointments. And there often are healthcare responsibilities such as bandaging, managing medications and treatment for side effects \u2014 and knowing when to call the doctor. \"Caregivers often worry about whether or not they are sufficiently prepared,\" Dr. Coscarelli says. \"With everything they are taking on, they also have physical limitations of their own, particularly with an older spouse. In the case of adult children, they may have their own children and family, as well as work responsibilities. And they also are dealing with the emotional response that comes when someone you love is sick. When the diagnosis is serious, there also is the fear of abandonment, of losing someone who may be your closest confidant.\" At the Simms/Mann center, family caregivers are encouraged to take proactive steps to avoid the negative outcomes that are often associated with the caregiving experience, including fatigue and reductions in sleep, increased social isolation and declines in pleasurable activities, depression and poor health practices. Among other things, caregivers are encouraged to keep up their physical fitness, attend to their own doctor's appointments and engage in enjoyable activities, including those that keep them socially connected. \"We urge them to figure out what it is that only they can do and what others can help with,\" Dr. Coscarelli says. \"Then, they should have a list handy of what others can do when they call and offer to help, whether it's bringing a meal, grocery shopping, picking up kids from school or driving the patient to a chemotherapy appointment.\" The Simms/Mann center also emphasizes the importance of open communication between caregivers and their loved ones, including a discussion of needs and sharing feelings about the illness and changing roles. \"For some people, there can be a positive side to caregiving \u2014 a sense of purpose and meaning despite all of the distress that goes with the illness,\" Dr. Coscarelli says. \"We tell caregivers that it's normal to feel distress and some negative emotions, and that feelings at both ends of the continuum can coexist. Ideally, you find outlets for the distress that allows you to bring your best self to the experience.\"everything else they have the stress of dealing with prostate cancer,\" says William Aronson, MD, UCLA professor of urology and IMPACT regional medical director. \"To have a nurse assisting with things like making appointments, filling prescriptions, making sure they have transportation and referring them for psychological counseling when needed is extremely valuable.\" In his role as medical director, Dr. Aronson oversees the prostate-cancer care for the program's patients, reviewing cases with the nurse case managers and ensuring that patients are directed to specialists in their area as needed. \"We carefully screen all of the physicians we sign up, and we make sure our patients are receiving state-of-the-art care,\" he says. Laura Baybridge, the program's original administrator, says that beyond their work with the patients, the nurse case managers have helped to ensure that all IMPACT physicians are meeting the highest standards of prostate-cancer treatment. \"Low-income patients living in the most remote sections of the state are getting the same quality of services you would receive at UCLA or any of the other top-tier medical centers across the country,\" says Baybridge, currently the chief administrative officer for the UCLA Department of Urology. \"And bringing the care for IMPACT patients up to the highest standards raises the level of care for these physicians' other patients as well.\"To view a video about caregiver self-care, go to: uclahealth.org/caregivers For more information about UCLA Center for Integrative Oncology, go to: simmsmanncenter.ucla.edu For more information program, go to: www.california-impact.org UCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631) UCLA Stein Eye Institute, which recently celebrated its 50th anniversary, consistently ranks among the top centers in the nation for the preservation of sight and prevention of blindness, as well as for its groundbreaking research, ophthalmology -training program and outreach to the community, locally and globally. The institute's footprint in Los Angeles is larger than ever on the heels of an affiliation agreement with Doheny Eye Institute that has led to the opening of three Doheny Eye Center UCLA offices \u2014 in Arcadia, Fountain Valley and Pasadena \u2014 along with UCLA Stein Eye Institute facilities in Westwood and Santa Monica. The Stein Eye Institute's surgical- and outpatient -treatment volume has grown more than tenfold since its opening. Bartly J. Mondino, MD, director of UCLA Stein Eye Institute, chair of the UCLA Department of Ophthalmology and Bradley R. Straatsma, MD, Endowed Chair in Ophthalmology, recently reflected on the advances that have occurred in his field over the past 50 years and the c ontinuing impact of UCLA Stein Eye Institute.50 Years of CareOphthalmology's Advances Reflected in at UCLA Stein Eye Institute INTERVIEW Vital Signs Summer 2017 Vol. 75 9Ophthalmology's Advances Reflected in at UCLA Stein Eye Institute Bartly J. Mondino, MD Overall, how different is the practice of ophthalmology today from when UCLA Stein Eye Institute opened its doors 50 years ago? Over the course of five decades, every aspect of our work here has been refined and redefined. We see developments almost every day: greater precision, smaller incisions, more detailed imagery, better ways to identify problems, new treatments for the previously untreatable. All of these elements are changing patient care for the better. What are some of the best examples of these advances? Take cataract surgery. When I started in ophthalmology, large incisions were necessary and patients were kept for several days in the hospital, after which they still required very thick glasses or contact lenses. Fast forward to the present day, when cataract surgery is an outpatient procedure and the patient goes home with a lens inserted in the eye to correct vision. We've also seen important advances in corneal surgery. Today, in many cases rather than replacing the entire central cornea, we have the option of replacing only the back layers, which means less chance of rejection, along with a smaller-sized wound and less suturing. Another dramatic example is in macular degeneration, a leading cause of vision loss among older adults, and previously untreatable. Now, with anti-VEGF therapy, we inject medications into the vitreous of the eye to prevent the growth of blood vessels, which have the potential to rupture and cause vision loss. At the Stein Institute, we were part of the early clinical trials of these agents, some of which also are being used for diabetic retinopathy, which is a growing concern with the epidemic of diabetes in our society. What other conditions do you see more of today than in the past? Age is the major risk factor for most of the conditions we see. So when you think about how much longer we're living today than people were 50 years ago, it's not surprising that we're seeing more cataracts, more macular degeneration and more glaucoma, which have been the three biggest causes of visual disability in the United States. We don't think much about cataracts because that condition is so easily treated now, but that would be a leading cause of blindness if it wasn't treated. The conditions that are causing the most blindness now are glaucoma and macular degeneration. You spoke of the advances in treating macular degeneration. Where is the field with glaucoma? Glaucoma continues to be treated using topical drops and drugs, and if that's not successful, surgery is performed. Today, there are less extensive surgical treatments for glaucoma using smaller devices, which makes for a faster recovery, but, unfortunately, the vision outcomes are not significantly improved. So glaucoma still is a big challenge and a major research focus. In addition to controlling the intraocular pressure, there is an ongoing focus on finding agents that will protect cells in the retina so that they don't degenerate. Everyone wants to see well, but what's the larger impact UCLA Stein Eye Institute makes by addressing vision problems? Just as an example, a member of our faculty conducted a study showing that cataract surgery reduced the risk of fall-related hip fractures among the elderly. So these advances have a public-health impact beyond the quality of life that comes with better vision. On the other side of the age spectrum, we know that vision problems can affect school performance, and too often, children in underserved communities are just living with those problems. So we are doing outreach in these communities to provide eye care and glasses, as well as to screen children so that when they go to school they're ready. Our Mobile Eye Clinic, which Stein Eye Institute has operated for more than 40 years, goes to schools, senior centers, health fairs, homeless shelters, and low-income community clinics to provide eye care and screening. It's easy to say Stein Eye Institute is helping patients who come to us from all over the world, but if people are struggling with vision problems in Los Angeles County, we still have work to do, and often that means we need to go to them. UCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631) \"The thinking used to be that it was best to put off introducing highly allergenic foods such as egg whites and white fish until children turned at least 1, and peanuts until after they turned 3,\" says Ronald Tsao, MD, a UCLA pediatrician and internal-medicine physician in Redondo Beach. \"But recent studies show that early exposure, particularly to peanut-containing foods, lowers the risk for food allergies.\" Peanut allergies tend to develop in childhood and can cause severe reactions ranging from sneezing, coughing and vomiting to, in the most severe cases, loss of consciousness, drop in blood pressure and even death. \"For parents, having a child with a severe peanut allergy can cause a great deal of anxiety,\" Dr. Tsao says. \"You have to be constantly vigilant about what your child eats, and there is a fear about exposing the child to new foods that might contain peanuts or were even processed in a facility where they could come into contact with peanuts.\" \"The challenge is that children with these allergies can be inadvertently exposed, such as when they share food they didn't realize came into contact with peanuts,\" adds Gifty-Maria Ntim, MD, a UCLA pediatrician and internal-medicine physician in Santa Clarita. \"If we can prevent peanut allergies from developing by introducing peanut-containing foods earlier, that will make a huge impact on the lives of families at risk.\" The new guidelines from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recommend that infants who are believed to be at high risk for peanut allergies \u2014 typically because they have severe eczema (itchy or inflamed skin), an egg allergy or both \u2014 be given peanut- containing foods at 4-to-6 months of age, and that infants with mild or moderate eczema be introduced to the foods at about 6 months of age. Infants without eczema or any food allergy can have the peanut-containing foods introduced whenever it is deemed appropriate. Because peanuts are a choking hazard for infants, the first serving can involve a small amount of peanut butter mixed with a food the child likes, such as yogurt. \"If your child is in the high-risk category, it may be best to h ave a test done first and introduce the peanut-containing food in a doctor's office,\" Dr. Ntim says. She explains that an allergy blood test can be performed by a pediatrician, or the child can be sent to an allergist to perform a skin-prick test before giving an oral food challenge, where the child is given the food in front of the doctor to test for the reaction.ALLERGIES UCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631)Revised Guidelines Recommend Early Introduction of Peanut -Containing Foods To learn more about peanut allergy and the revised guidelines, go to: uclahealth.org/peanutallergyRather than avoiding peanuts, new guidelines recommend introducing peanut -containing foods to infants at an early age \u2014 as young as 4 -to-6 months for those believed to be at the highest risk \u2014 to prevent the development of peanut allergies. Vital Signs Summer 2017 Vol. 75 11The majority of people who suffer ankle sprains don't seek treatment, and in many cases that is appropriate, say two UCLA orthopaedic surgeons who specialize in foot-and-ankle injuries. But some sprains warrant professional attention, including physical therapy. In the most severe cases with persistent symptoms, surgery may be necessary. In those cases, ignoring the problem or trying to fight through the pain can aggravate the injury and prolong the recovery period. \"This is a very common injury, with a wide range in the severity of symptoms,\" says Joan R. Williams, MD, a UCLA orthopaedic surgeon, who sees patients in Santa Monica and Torrance. \"Some sprains just feel twisted or tweaked, and while they are a little swollen and tender, you can still walk. But ankle sprains can also be fairly severe, with lots of swelling and bruising, along with severe pain when any weight is placed on them.\" Too often, Dr. Williams notes, people shrug off their ankle sprain and resume normal activities without allowing the body to heal. Depending on the severity of the injury, she advises patients to avoid any impact on the injured ankle, including running and other athletic pursuits, for four-to-six weeks before gradually working up to previous levels. \"If you take a few weeks off and then try to run three-to-five miles your first day back, it's going to place too much stress on the injured ankle and prolong the symptoms,\" she cautions. Most ankle sprains heal with basic care that people can administer on their own, says Nelson SooHoo, MD, director of foot and ankle surgery for UCLA Orthopaedic Surgery. In the immediate aftermath of minor or moderate sprains, he advises patients to follow the guidelines that spell out the acronym RICE: rest by avoiding putting weight on the ankle (using crutches if necessary); ice to control swelling; compression to reduce swelling and immobilize the injury; and elevation that props the ankle above the waist. \"If you do these things and you begin to feel better, you probably don't need additional treatment,\" Dr. SooHoo says.People with a more severe ankle sprain \u2014 characterized by extreme bruising or swelling and an inability to bear weight on the foot without significant pain, or when there doesn't seem to be any improvement over the first several days after the injury \u2014 should seek medical attention, Drs. SooHoo and Williams say. In some cases, patients need only a walking boot or an ankle brace to stabilize the area during healing. When the ankle continues to feel weak or unstable after rest, physical therapy can be helpful. \"The majority of people will do well with nonoperative management, including physical therapy and rehabilitation, but for patients who still aren't better at that point, we can offer the likelihood of a successful result with surgery,\" Dr. SooHoo says. \"So if there is still a problem, you don't have to just live with ongoing functional limitations, as we have effective surgical reconstruction techniques.\" ORTHOPAEDICS Sprained Ankle : When Is It Time to See a Doctor?
