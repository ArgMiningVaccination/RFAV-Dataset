We also work with more active integrative therapies to get you moving through a greater range of motion with more strength, less pain and with more relaxation and freedom in your body. Mindful movement and custom exercise programs are used and designed to retrain normal movement patterns and improve posture and range of motion while gaining strength, stability, balance, and breath capacity. These active therapies may include: - Personalized wellness assessments - Therapeutic yoga - Posture training - Breath training - Movement/rest balancing - Return to activities after injury or other setbacks - Somatic motor control exercises and sensory integration - Core strength / stabilization - Neuro-dynamic exercises - Meditation, mindfulness, and calming the nervous system - Balance training - Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) - Collaboration in care with other providers Our physical therapy is primarily done with hands-on manual techniques, including direct techniques for joints and soft tissues and also gentle light-touch techniques for the more delicate tissues like fascia, vessels, nerves, and organ systems. No machines or modalities are used in our treatment sessions. Hands-on treatment techniques include: - CranioSacral therapy - Myofascial release - Muscle energy - Joint mobilization - Neural mobilization - Visceral techniques CranioSacral therapy, neural mobilization, visceral techniques, and myofascial release These are all light-touch manual techniques that work with the fascia or connective tissues within the body including the nerves, the spine, the cranium, the brain and the body's viscera or organ systems.
