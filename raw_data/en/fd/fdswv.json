The chakra has a crucial impact on our spirituality, connection, and consciousness. An active crown chakra aligns the remaining six chakras of the body. The chakra acts as the center of spirit and holds core values for wisdom and enlightenment. More importantly, the crown chakra governs universal consciousness, connection, and self-guidance. This chakra is our highest potential that rules communication and interaction with the universe. It also governs our senses of devotion and inspiration to help us better unite with our higher self and divine. A deeper understanding of life and attaining a healthy spiritual life also define the importance of the chakra. Interestingly, the crown chakra expresses universal connectedness to create harmony with nature and integrate the whole energy system in the universe. Location of the Chakra: Located above the crown of the head, the Sahasrara governs our consciousness, spirituality, and connection with mother nature. The chakra is the final and the highest chakra of the body; maybe that's the main reason it gets its name crown chakra. Crown Chakra Element: Unlike all the other chakras of the body, the elements of crown chakra are unique. Experts associate this chakra with thought and silence. Silence helps you achieve awareness, concentration, a sense of calm, and a better idea of creativity in you. Be more productive, creative, and active by concentrating on the strong internal voice harnessing the power of thought and silence. Crown Chakra Color: Again, the Sahasrara chakra is unique in that a mesmerizing amethyst violet color represents it. However, sometimes the chakra is represented by a pure white color with a gleaming hue of violet. The crown chakra color is a great mix of vibrant red and serene blue colors. Hence, this chakra color expresses extravagance, dignity, pride, mystery, ambition, and above all, understanding and wisdom. Crown Chakra Symbol: The symbol of the Sahasrra chakra is a circle guarded by one thousand petals. The symbol inspires you to hit your goals and reminds you of the abundant spiritual energy. Signs of Open and balanced Crown chakra: Feeling a deeper connection with the divine, higher consciousness, and a greater touch base with the universe indicates a balanced crown chakra. The person feels an unshakeable trust in the inner guidance. More importantly, a healthy and healed chakra amplifies our wisdom, expands our knowledge, and boosts our learning skills. Crown Chakra Crystals: The most popular crown chakra stone is the brilliant bright purple stone Amethyst. Besides, other crown chakra stones are Apophyllite, Lavender Quartz, Selenite, and Sugilite. To your surprise, diamond and clear quartz are powerful crown chakra stones that bring illumination and energy to the chakra. Third Eye Chakra Affirmations: The most simple yet intelligent way to heal the crown chakra blockage is the use of affirmations. Strong affirmations are starting from \"I am\" or \"I have,\" emphasizing spirituality, consciousness, and wisdom can heal a misaligned chakra. Crown Chakra Meaning Just like its majestic name, crown chakra meaning is also unique. Crown chakra gets its name from its Sanskrit origin Sahasrra which means the bridge of the cosmos. Hence, the actual crown chakra meaning relates to the coronet of all the body's energy centers. Some experts emphasize the importance of the chakra by comparing it with the umbilical cord to the divine. This deeper interaction helps us feel secure and connected to the oneness of all things. Feelings of isolation, worthlessness, and loneliness are the biggest hindrances in achieving the noble life cause. The crown chakra meanings assure that the force driving the universe is merely an expansion of the same dynamic energy that makes us up. The true crown chakra meanings help us better understand life's purpose, revitalizing the determination and enthusiasm in us. Crown Chakra Location The bridge of all the chakras, the Sahasrara, rules at the top of the head above the physical body. Like the crown sits atop the head, this seventh chakra radiates upwards hence getting its name Crown chakra. The chakra has a primary association with the pituitary gland and a secondary association with the pineal and the hypothalamus. This association justifies chakra's relation with brain functions, [spirituality and wisdom](https://crystal-shop.co/category/spiritual-energy/). Energetically the crown chakra has a deep connection with the nervous system of the body. As far as the connection with other chakras is concerned, the seventh chakra relates to the first chakra. Both the root and the first chakra are the extremities of our body's chakra systems and impart contentedness and devotion. What happens when your crown chakra is blocked or imbalanced? From an emotional standpoint to physiological, spiritual, or mental, crown chakra health and alignment is very important. Specific abnormalities arise due to the choking of energy or crown chakra blockage. Like every other chakra of the body, the Sahasrara holds certain powers and properties. The deviation from the norm in these characteristics tells us about the abnormality in the chakra. Let's have a deep dive into learning about some of the emotional and physical ailments due to the crown chakra blockage: Psychological cues that accompany an imbalanced crown chakra A range of psychological ailments acts as red flags that point towards the problem of blockage or misalignment. Specific indications that relate to the trouble with the seventh chakra are: - Feeling lost or stuck, especially losing concentration while meditating. - You may find it challenging to connect with the things around you. Ultimately, it also affects the root chakra energy, and you may feel pessimistic and low in self-esteem. - Spiritual apathy and disinterest may start creeping into your life. - A dominant feeling of boredom, lack of attentiveness, and antsy with the mundane may accompany crown chakra blockage. - A strong feeling that you have lost your purpose of life, disengagement with wisdom, and lack of concentration also relate to a blocked upper chakra. - Last, if you have an inviolable desire for complete isolation from your social circle, know that you need crown chakra healing. - Growing distant from your relationships, frustration, bitterness, and fuss over nothing also tell you about the misalignment.

It means that while you feel certain emotional disturbances with a disruption in the chakra energy, physical ailments also come along.

As the crown chakra is spiritual, the physical imbalances mainly include: - First off, sensitivity to light - Second, sensitivity to sound - In addition, uncontrollable irritation and frustration in public - Last feeling misfit with the surrounding or fear of alienation But as the crown chakra is not physical, more spiritual and emotional disturbances accompany its blockage.

After that, elevate the pelvis, straightening your legs, and lift your knees off the ground. Further, walk in to adjust your feet in a way that your shoulders are directly over your elbows. Bend your knee and slowly extend your left leg up to the wall. Flex your feet, keeping your heels on the wall, and repeat the same with the right leg. Stay in the position for five breaths and start reversing the posture. Now rest in the child's pose for a while, and you are ready to go. Benefits of Supported Headstand for the Crown chakra opening - First, the pose dramatically reduces stress and knocks out depression. - Secondly, it also stimulates the pineal and pituitary glands. - More importantly, the pose unblocks the chakra energy flow in the crown region. - Finally, the pose also alleviates medical conditions like asthma, insomnia, infertility, and sinusitis.
