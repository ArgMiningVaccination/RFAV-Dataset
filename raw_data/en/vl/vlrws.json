Boost Gut Health A key benefit of a colon cleanse is its capacity to boost digestive efficiency. Expelling accumulated waste and toxins enhances nutrient absorption and helps prevent constipation. Furthermore, it is an effective solution for digestive discomforts like bloating and irregular bowel movements, providing significant relief and improving overall digestive health. Increase Energy Levels Accumulated waste in the colon can weigh you down and make you feel lethargic. By cleansing the colon, you rid your body of this waste, increasing energy levels and overall vitality. Complete Detoxification A colon cleanse serves as an effective method for detoxification. By eliminating toxins from your body, you reduce the risk of developing various health conditions and increase your body's ability to absorb essential vitamins and nutrients, improving your overall health and well-being. WHAT'S INCLUDED? Clean, Pure, Premium Supplements 100% VEGAN | GLUTEN-FREE | NO ADDITIVES, FILLERS, OR PRESERVATIVES Oxy-Powder, an oxygen-based intestinal cleanser, delicately purges toxins while fostering a conducive environment for probiotics to thrive. Latero-Flora is a natural probiotic designed to bolster your gut's microbiota, thereby facilitating streamlined digestion and promoting a healthier colon. The Colon Cleanse Program comes with comprehensive, user-friendly instructions complemented by unwavering, complimentary support from our dedicated Customer Satisfaction Team. Frequently Asked Questions What should I expect when doing the cleanse? Oxy-Powder will naturally cause loose/watery stools to facilitate the cleansing process. It's not diarrhea but a by-product of oxidation. When taken as suggested (at night before bed), it will work in the body while you sleep and will usually lead to a loose movement the next morning. Latero Flora is consumed in the morning, and it will help with digestion throughout the day. I have been doing colon cleansing but haven't seen the results. Today is my 5th day. It barely takes me to the bathroom. What am I doing wrong? During the Colon Cleanse, everyone's dosage will differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age, as well as physical and emotional stress levels. The average dosage will range from 4-10 capsules in general, and your serving should allow you to achieve 3 movements (mostly liquid consistency). We suggest taking 2 - 4 capsules of Oxy-Powder at night before bed, this will allow it to work while you sleep, and the result should be an urgency in the morning when you wake up. If you do NOT achieve the 3 movements, you can increase your dosage by 2 capsules each night until this is accomplished. Once you find the correct serving, you will stick with this amount daily for 6 days. How often can one do this cleanse with what is included in the program? One Colon Cleanse Program is ideal for one 6-day protocol. The remaining capsules of Latero-Flora and Oxy-Powder can be used as a maintenance regimen by taking them 2-3 times weekly or as desired. What happens if I skip a day? Does it need to be 6 consecutive days? We recommend a 6-day program to cleanse your intestinal tract as much as possible. If you skip a day, consider adding an extra day of Latero-Flora and Oxy-Powder toward the end of the cleanse. We also suggest adding lemon juice (about one-half lemon) into your evening water when taking Oxy-Powder to make the cleanse the most effective. I suffer from constipation followed by bouts of diarrhea. Is Oxy-Powder appropriate for me, or will it make me worse? Oxy-Powder will liquefy solids and produce a loose movement, this flushing effect is excellent for addressing occasional constipation by softening fecal impaction without causing additional side effects. It also removes toxins from the digestive tract that can cause inflammation and irritation, leading to diarrhea. In general, Oxy-Powder will help address both concerns. Can you do this cleanse if you have a leaky gut or SIBO? The Colon Cleanse Program is excellent for cleansing the entire digestive tract and addressing occasional constipation. It's been safe and helpful when dealing with SIBO and a leaky gut. Please also consider checking with a trusted healthcare provider before use for additional tips and guidance. Can Oxy-Powder be taken in the morning instead? We recommend taking Oxy-Powder in the evenings, about two hours after dinner, since it works best while your body is at rest. If you prefer to take this during the day, we suggest Oxy-Powder is consumed two to three hours before or after food or other supplements for the best results. I had gastric sleeve surgery, so I don't have a full stomach (regretfully). Will the colon cleanse be any risk of irritating my stomach? The Colon Cleanse Program is gentle and non-abrasive when removing toxins and fecal impaction. We anticipate that this protocol will work and be safe for you. Since everyone is different, we recommend you work with your healthcare provider if you have any medical concerns. You can also try starting with half of the recommended servings at your discretion to see how both products affect you slowly. Is it okay to just take the Oxy-Powder? What happens if I don't take the probiotic in the mornings? While you can still see results with Oxy-Powder alone, we highly suggest utilizing Latero-Flora since it's a detox-friendly probiotic that helps eliminate harmful organisms, balance candida overgrowth, and maximize your cleansing experience. Can I do two cleanses at the same time? We recommend doing the Colon on its own initially to allow your body to eliminate toxins efficiently. We also suggest the Colon Cleanse Program as the first step before moving to any other cleanse. I've heard that doing several colon and liver cleanses back-to-back has the best results. In what order would you take them? We offer the Complete Body Cleanse Program, which puts all cleanse steps into a specific order.

A fruit diet is typically recommended for optimal results. The fruits and vegetables that are suggested will bring water, enzymes, fiber, and other beneficial aspects into the body that help with cleansing. We understand that a raw vegan diet is not always possible for everyone. Try to stick to a healthy diet and incorporate more of the suggested foods. Some additional dietary suggestions are "}
