The reality we face is that believing this information through our logical mind can often limit our perception of these elements at play. What does feeling spiritual energy involve? Have you ever walked into a space and felt a shift in your energy levels? There are some who brush it aside as insignificant, and for some who have exposed themselves to spiritual experiences in the past are naturally sensitive to the energies, might have tried to make sense of it. Our entire cosmos is held together by a single vibration, oscillating at multiple frequencies. For the sake of understanding, let us define these frequencies into two: Higher frequencies and lower frequencies. The effects of High Frequencies: - A certain lightness coupled with a sense of calm - Sensations on the back of your neck - A gentle breeze along with a familiar smell - Unexplained blissfulness Higher frequencies usually found in places where there is an atmosphere of calm, gratitude, where there is a release of more positively charged emotions. Temples or worship places often carry a high frequency. Sometimes, you can feel this even when you're just closer to nature. The effects of Low Frequencies: - Heavy feeling in the chest area - Uncomfortable sensations around the head and shoulders, usually coupled with heaviness - You feel drained without much physical activity - You might take on emotions which are not yours Lower frequencies often found in an environment where there is a release of more negative emotions. Funerals and even hospitals can sometimes carry lower frequencies. Where it does take a certain amount of awareness to cultivate the ability to sense energy, changes in different environments, at times the presence of spirits can also drastically alter the energy of a place. So how does one learn how to detect spirits? Human Spirits Human spirits are the deceased, and one would feel heaviness in their chest or pressure around the neck region. You may feel like there is a sudden rise in temperature in the form of a burst of hot air around you. Some people have often talked about feeling claustrophobic or sudden heaviness causing anxiety. This can be attributed to the presence of a human spirit. Ghosts [Ghosts](https://www.spiritualunite.com/articles/orbs-color-meaning/) are human spirits that have not yet crossed over. You may feel dense energy or presence around, a very cold or chilling sensation down your spine or a sinking feeling in your stomach. Spirits Spirits are energy of light, and they often vibrate at a very high frequency, making it impossible for the feeling to be missed. A sudden upsurge of energy or a bright and flashing light or a feeling that you're always safe are some of the changes you could feel. Earth Spirits Have you spent a day in nature and coming back in a playful and joyous mood? Or you've been feeling down, and suddenly you feel like joking around with everyone. This is usually the work of an earth spirit. Conclusion It is only when we open ourselves up to the mysteries of the universe, do we then understand how connected everything is. Feeling spiritual energy is not a gift confined to a few, but an ability all of us can cultivate through meditation or simply practised awareness. "}
