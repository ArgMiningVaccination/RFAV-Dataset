Ayurveda provides us with an individualized approach via the doshas, but underlining our doshas and individual needs, is our universal need for consistency. Of course what we need changes and Ayurveda invites us to become aware of the seasons, patterns, times of day, and life cycles. Through that awareness we learn to harmonize our internal environment with the external environment. Yes, we want to shift to warmer foods in colder weather. But more fundamentally, we need to eat at consistent times year around. The list below may seem very basic, but I guarantee it will solve most of our dis-eases. Consistency for Life= daily self care routine (dinacharya)= balanced! Awake at a similar time each day (ideally within 30 minutes of the same time everyday to promote healthy cortisol production.) Sleep at a similar time. Get restful sleep ideally before 10pm. Eat at consistent times. Do not skip meals, unless you are sick. Eat breakfast within 1 hour of rising (or a lite snack if you exercise). Drink enough water, approx. 2 liters per day. Daily bathing and abhyanga (oiliantion of the skin, see glossary). Cleansing practices- including kriyas, tongue scraping, neti pot. Daily breathing and meditation practices. Daily exercise/movement (asana practice). Cycles of the day and dominant dosha 6:00 am to 10:00 am: Kapha time 10:00 am to 2:00 pm: Pitta time 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm: Vata time 6:00pm to 10:00 pm : Kapha time 10:00 pm to 2:00 am: Pitta time 2:00 am to 6:00 am: Vata time Arise before 6:00 am ideally, be awake to greet the sun. Traditionally, yogis rose up to 2 hours before the sun to wash and meditate during Brahma muhurtham, the pre-dawn stillness connected to God or spirit. Kapha dominates between 6:00 am - 10:00 am, so it's ideal to arise before kapha time; very active pittas may get away with rising later and need more sleep. Begin your day with a moment of gratitude for making it to another day, however that looks for you. Greet the sun! If you have family or feel distracted when you wake up, sit in bed for 10 minutes and meditate, otherwise you can do your sitting practice once you get up. Kapha Time 6:00 am to 10:00 am \u2014 Morning Ritual Awaken your senses- A traditional practice to start the day is to consciously awaken the sense organs. It can be done in many ways- most simply splash cold water mindfully on the ears, nose, eyes, mouth and face and consciously acknowledge the awakening of each sense as you do that. The 5 sense organs are ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and skin. Abhyanga and bathing (oilination of the skin): Traditionally warm oil is applied to dry skin, left to soak for 15 minutes, and then washed/rinsed off with warm water in the bath or shower so the oil absorbs into the skin. Sit on the edge of the bed or bath, and massage oil onto your dry skin. This practice is incredibly grounding and nourishing, to the immune and nerve system. If this seems too complicated, oilinate the skin at the end of the shower and then rinse with the oil still on. For those with a busy and early morning abhyanga can also be completed at night and support sleep. Cleansing practices: brush your teeth and tongue scrape, wash your face to remove toxins from the day before. Optional: practice oil pulling, swishing and massaging sesame or coconut oil in the mouth to remove toxins from the night before. You can use \u00bc cup or 3 TBS of oil in the mouth and try to swish for 5 minutes. Just try your best Drink sole: Take in an electrolyte balancing drink first thing in the AM at least 15 minutes prior to drinking tea, coffee, food etc. This supports your kidneys & adrenals by helping to build your electrolytes for the day. How to make sole. Sole is a salt water brine. This is the quick recipe: Add approximately 12 teaspoon of Atlantic Grey salt to 8 oz (or less) of warm water first thing in the AM. It should be slightly salty to taste, but not enough to make you gag. Kosher, rock, baking, iodized and even \"sea salt\" are all refined or washed. Even if it says \"good quality sea salt\" (like from TJ's or Whole foods), it may not be bleached like table salt but it is rinsed of trace minerals. Meditation & Pranayama (15 minutes) You can do this during the time the abhyanga sets or after the shower or in bed upon waking. Sit for 10 minutes and do pranayama for 5ish. If you have a regular meditation practice sit for longer. I have a really hard time just sitting there to meditate, and with high vata staying anywhere long enough to get results is challenging. It's worth it though! If you practice asana, the traditional order is asana, pranayama, meditation. For an easy at home Asana practice do 6-12 sun salutations. I recommend taking at least 3 yoga, dance, or movement classes during the week Breakfast Traditionally a yogi starts the day with a bit of sweet-medicated honey (chyawanprash). You can also starts the day with a bit of honey in herbal tea, or a small piece of fruit. Otherwise skip straight to a light and warm breakfast before 10:00 am. Too heavy a breakfast during kapha time can be hard, especially if you are kapha dosha dominate. Miso soup, hot quinoa or poached eggs with greens. Excellent activities for the AM (pre 10am) kapha time meditation exercise studying Pitta time 10:00 am - 2:00 pm \u2014 Keep it Mellow! This is often the bulk of our workday, so we are using our bodies and minds the most. Try to remember to do pranayama and take stretch breaks when feeling stressed. Notice if you feel fiery. During pitta time of day, our emotions may be elevated. It is also the time when we are most productive. Lunch This should be the largest meal with the most protein to keep us energized for the active part of the day. Pitta digestion can break it down, so if you want to eat salad or raw greens, this is the time. Vata dosha has the hardest time with raw greens, so if you have a sensitive stomach go light or skip it. Stick with lentils & quinoa, pesto, greens, etc. Make sure you sit and enjoy your meal. Take a moment of gratitude before eating. Try to avoid eating at the computer, talking, standing, or driving. Chew Slowly. Vata Time 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm Most of us feel tired and a bit drained by mid afternoon (especially if we are crashing from caffeine), but still have hours to go. Taking an afternoon rest or restorative yoga is especially ideal for fall, vata types or busy pittas. It is also a great time for pranayama. Try legs up the wall for 10 minutes. It's a game changer. If you're at work take it as your \"smoke break, ha, ha.\" Put an eye pillow or cloth over your eyes and breath slowly. Set an alarm so you're not tempted to keep checking the time. If you absolutely can't lay down, practice another 12 rounds of pranayama, seated. Between 2:00 to 4:00, the kidneys/adrenals are activated and we often crave sugar, caffeine, & carbs, etc. Try sole again or a piece of fruit during this time and don't get too hungry or thirsty. If you have trouble sleeping start taking relaxing teas in the afternoon. Honor the Sunset Chanting, prayers, screaming, hiking, pausing, acknowledging the cycles of the day are beautiful ways to get in touch with the natural world. Take the opportunity to pause and notice the shifts in weather and seasonal patterns from day to day. It's not sunny every afternoon, just like we're not always happy. The weather reflects our moods; use it as a reminder that things are constantly changing. We are not fixed beings (the idea of Anicca, or impermanence). Kapha Time 6:00 pm to 10:00 pm This is the time to unwind from the day's activities. Often we feel tired after the sun sets, but we also might still be activated from the heat of pitta and hyperactivity of vata times of day, or feel like we still have hours of work to do! Pace your day to allow yourself to enjoy the evening as a time to read, relax, unwind, and spend time with family and friends. It's ideal to get off the computer before 8:00 pm. The artificial light from the computers, as well as the speedy movement of information, increases vata and affects our sleep cycles. If you're still on at 10:00 pm when we return to pitta time it throws off the system. This is especially important in fall! Dinner 6:00 to 7:00 pm Digest before kapha gets too late. Similar to lunch, but lighter. Evening Ritual Similar to the morning - a wash and brush, optional: abhyanga, nasya, massage or soak feet. Drink CALM Calm Magnesium Supplement by Natural Vitality Herbal Teas Golden Milk (almond or coconut with spices like cardamom and nutmeg help us to sleep and ground vata). Go to Bed Ideally by or before 10:00 pm. After 10:00 pm we return to pitta time and it becomes very hard to rest. "}
