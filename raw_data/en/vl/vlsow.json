It first helps to have an understanding of what energy is to help to answer this question. Quantum Physics states that everything that exists in the whole universe is made up of energy that constantly flows and changes form. Even though everything in the universe appears to look different, it all comes from the same energy - it just vibrates at a different speed so it exists on a different frequency, which either makes it tangible or intangible. Universal life energy is healing, life-giving energy that sustains and nourishes all living things. In some cultures is it referred to as chi or prana. As the flow of life force energy moves through our physical, emotional, and spiritual bodies, it can become unbalanced, stagnant or blocked. When this happens, we experience what is called dis-ease. \"Dis-ease,\" as the spelling suggests, is \"lack of ease.\" It is the inability of one's life force energy to flow freely. If you are experiencing dis-ease physically, emotionally or spiritually, then yes, energy healing is for you. What can I expect from an energy healing session? During your hour long session, you will lay on a massage table (fully clothed), be guided through a systematic relaxation practice, receive hands on energy work, and then lastly (if time allows) be guided through a chakra balancing meditation. Systematic relaxation is a skill that can be acquired through practice. The intention to relax should be held passively in that it is something we must learn to allow to happen, versus making it happen. Relaxation gives rest to the body, especially to any areas of chronic tension, rest to the nervous system, and rest to the mind. When we do this, we liberate the body's self-healing power, as its natural energies, now unrestrained, flow to where they are needed the most. The hands on energy work will be a combination of cellular touch and Reiki. The process of cellular touch is to help awaken the cells to themselves. The wellness of each cell or cellular group of tissues establishes the ground of our being in the manifest world. The more efficient our cellular respiration, the more vitally alive our cells will be. I will be combining cellular touch with very gentle soft tissue tractioning, meaning I will begin to traction your limbs energetically from your center as well as gently traction the physical body. Reiki is an ancient, hands-on system of natural healing using the universal life force energy. It is believed that by conveying love, compassion and touch, healing can occur. Chakra is a Sanskrit term meaning \"wheel\" or \"disk.\" In the ancient Indian system, these centers of \"spinning energy\" in the body help to maintain your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual balance. Although there are many chakras in the body, there are 7 main chakras along the spine, and through the neck and the crown of your head. They correspond to specific organs as well as physical, emotional, psychological and spiritual states of being and influence all areas of your life. Illness, trauma and stress can cause imbalances (blockages or deficiencies) that can result in an array of ailments and disturbances. The guided meditation along with the Energy Healing will help to release these blockages helping to bring the body back to a state of homeostasis.
