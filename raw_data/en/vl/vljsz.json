As studies show, Demeter and organic raw materials also contain significantly more antioxidants than conventional products. In addition, active ingredients in natural foods can usually be better absorbed than artificially produced substances. The AOX\u00ae OPC supplement is therefore the purest and most natural form to strengthen and support the body from within. Demeter quality without additives The grape seed flour for my OPC preparation is obtained from our own Demeter grape seeds and pressed together with only organic apple fibre. The pellets do not contain any capsule shells or other synthetic fillers and ingredients, which are often added to dietary supplements. Antioxidants: Natural skin & cell protection Antioxidants are natural substances that help the body neutralize harmful free radicals. OPC are among the strongest antioxidants and have a proven positive effect. In addition to antioxidant properties, OPC can inhibit inflammation, strengthen the immune system and have a positive effect on blood pressure, cholesterol, skin and hair. Antioxidant tablets for ingestion 100% Demeter grape seed flour + apple fiber Purely natural: pellets without capsule shells and additives Grown & made in Austria 120 tablets Take 2-3 pieces in the morning and evening AOX\u00ae - OPC supplements made from 100% Demeter grape seed flour and apple fibre My OPC pellets are a purely natural product, made from our own bio-dynamic grape seeds, without any capsule shell or other fillers. One of the foods with the highest antioxidant capacity, grape seed flour can help support healthy body, skin and hair. Manufacturing: Pure & Natural After the grapes have been pressed, the press cake, is processed daily so that no oxidation takes place and all the good ingredients are preserved. The kernels are separated from the shells, cleaned and dried for several weeks. The dry seeds are then cold-pressed, which produces the valuable grape seed oil. But the leftover press cake is still full of nutritionally healthy ingredients and is therefore ground into grape seed flour. The flour is then pressed into a tablet using only organic apple fiber as a binding agent - completely natural and healthy. OPC - Oligomeric proanthocyanidins OPC are among the best free radical scavengers, the effect of which surpasses that of other antioxidants such as vitamin C or vitamin E. OPC are phytochemicals, i.e. completely natural antioxidants, which neutralize negative metabolic products such as \"free radicals\". They are found in many plants and mainly serve to protect the plant from negative effects such as UV radiation. Ingested through food or cosmetic products, they can also protect the body from oxidative damage and have a proven positive effect on the immune system, blood count, skin and hair. Grape seed flour contains a particularly high proportion of OPC, making it one of the foods with the highest antioxidant capacity (ORAC value). EFFECT OPC Due to the neutralization of free radicals, numerous positive properties for the body, skin and hair are attributed to OPC. The antioxidants can help protect blood vessels from oxidative damage, thereby strengthening them and counteracting cardiovascular problems. In addition to the antioxidant properties, OPC can also have an anti-inflammatory effect, strengthen the immune system and have a positive effect on blood pressure, cholesterol, skin and hair. OPC is said to even inhibit the activation of certain enzymes and thus counteract the release of histamine and allergic symptoms. And the female hormone balance is said to be positively influenced by OPC and PMS symptoms, if taken regularly, are alleviated after two to four months. International groups of experts even found out that polyphenols from grape seeds can prevent or at least delay the precursor to Alzheimer's. INGESTION: Depending on your height and weight, I recommend taking 2-3 tablets in the morning and evening, preferably with a meal. For therapeutic use, the dosage can be increased. Taking it together with vitamin C (e.g. lemon or orange juice) can have a positive effect. Since dairy products can impair OPC absorption, I do not recommend taking the AOX\u00ae preparation with such. NOTE: If you have an intolerance or allergy to grapes or apples, do not take this product. Taking the pellets cannot replace a healthy and balanced diet, but it can complement it positively. 100% ORGANIC - CERTIFIED BY DEMETER: Demeter is the oldest and one of the strictest organic certificates worldwide.
