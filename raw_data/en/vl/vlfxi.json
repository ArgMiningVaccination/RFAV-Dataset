Scroll to the end of this article for an Elderberry Chai recipe brimming with benefits, excerpted from the book. \"The natural world is always my biggest source of inspiration,\" Ducham said to Clean Eating. \"Plants and fungi have so much to teach us. Witnessing the shifts people can make by incorporating medicinal herbs into their daily routines is another big source of inspiration. It's what I love most about my work.\" The book comes at a poignant moment. Ducham describes the current climate as one of \"hyper-productivity, unchecked technology, ecological crisis and political uncertainty.\" She describes self-care in these times as a pillar of empowerment - taking your well-being into your own hands in a troubling world. \"By paying attention to my needs and experimenting with how common culinary herbs and kitchen staples could be used to improve my health,\" she says. \"I realized how empowering and versatile herbal medicine is.\" At the same time, she doesn't see self-care as simply a respite from the world's issues. Instead, Ducham poses it as a solution for communal healing: Self-care is much bigger than just caring for yourself, despite what the name implies. According to Ducham's philosophy, herbalism-based self-care is intrinsically tied to the well-being of your surrounding ecology and community, too. Your health is tied to that of the planet At CE, we frequently discuss harnessing the power of plants for personal health and well-being. We love to see our philosophies echoed and corroborated by experts like Ducham. In her book, she shares some core ideas we've discussed for years: - Food is medicine, and the health of the digestive system speaks to the health of the whole body. - Herbs, diet and lifestyle are at the heart of well-being. - By working to create meals and self-care practices that combine a whole-foods, nutrient-dense diet with both fresh and dried herbs and spices, we begin to bridge the gap between our modern lives and the healing food ways that came before.
