Low vitamin D and low calcium and/or phosphate can cause nutritional rickets - Sunlight is the most important source of vitamin D at all ages - Vitamin D deficiency is common in risk groups and should be self-managed wherever possible - through education, behaviour change and supplementation as required - In Australia, nutritional rickets is generally only seen in infants and children with dark skin Background - Sunlight (UVB) is the most important source of vitamin D (>90%) through skin synthesis of D3. This varies with - Skin colour: people with dark skin ( [Fitzpatrick types](https://www.arpansa.gov.au/sites/default/files/legacy/pubs/RadiationProtection/FitzpatrickSkinType.pdf) V and VI) require greater UVB exposure compared to people with light skin - Skin exposure: covering clothing may result in low vitamin D levels - Season/UVB availability: during winter there may not be enough UVB to maintain adequate vitamin D levels in southerly latitudes. Sunscreens do not result in low vitamin D with normal use - Only small amounts of vitamin D are available from diet: - the main natural food source is fish - breastmilk, despite its other benefits, contains almost no vitamin D - infant formula is fortified with vitamin D - In the absence of sun exposure, recommended intakes of vitamin D are: - 0-12 months old: 400 units daily - 1-18 years old: 400-600 units daily - 25-OH-D is used to measure vitamin D status - The recommended 25-OH-D level is 50 nmol/L at all ages and during pregnancy | | Definitions of vitamin D status | | Severe deficiency | | <12.5 nmol/L | | Moderate deficiency | | 12.5-29 nmol/L | | Mild deficiency | | 30-49 nmol/L | | Sufficient | | 50 nmol/L | | Elevated | | 250 nmol/L* *Toxicity is defined as serum 25-OH-D >250 nmol/L with hypercalcaemia and suppression of parathyroid hormone (PTH) Assessment Red flag features in Red Risk factors - Lack of skin exposure to sun (time inside, covering clothes) - Dark skin - Medical conditions affecting Vitamin D metabolism (obesity, liver/renal failure, severe malabsorption, medications) Infants: exclusive breastfeeding AND any of: the above risk factors, maternal deficiency or prematurity History - Time outdoors and covering clothing - Dietary history (calcium intake, breastfeeding/formula in infants) - Previous vitamin D levels and treatment - a wide range of formulations are available - check dosing ( [photoboard](https://www.rch.org.au/immigranthealth/clinical/Vitamin_D_supplements_photoboard/)) and adherence - Family understanding - Non-specific bony/muscular pain, fatigue with exercise - Poor growth, motor delay and irritability (infants) - Symptoms of low calcium: muscle cramps, tetany, stridor, seizures (rare beyond 6-12 months of age) Examination - Growth parameters, exclusion of other musculoskeletal pathology - [Fitzpatrick skin type](https://www.arpansa.gov.au/sites/default/files/legacy/pubs/RadiationProtection/FitzpatrickSkinType.pdf) - Delayed dentition (no teeth by 9 months, no molars by 14 months) - Rickets: - long bone deformity (eg genu varum/valgus - if weight bearing) - widening of wrists/ankles - delayed anterior fontanelle closure (normally closed by 2 years) - frontal bossing - rosary (widening of ribs at costochondral junction) - increased risk of fracture Management Flowchart - Investigation and treatment of low vitamin D - Breast fed infants <12 months with other risk factors can usually start supplements (400 units daily) without investigations, provided they do not have symptoms/signs - Consider admission: symptomatic hypocalcaemia (including tetany, stridor, seizures) or severe rickets - Specialist review: infants with symptoms/signs, clinical rickets, abnormal serum calcium, or vitamin D deficiency not responding to high dose supplements Investigations - Breastfed babies can usually be started on supplements without testing - Screen children/adolescents with one or more risk factors for low vitamin D (25-OH-D, Ca, PO4, and ALP) - Also check PTH if low calcium intake, symptoms, or multiple risk factors - Infants and children with rickets need additional investigations: - 25-OH-D, Ca, PO4, ALP, Mg, PTH, UEC, urine Ca, PO4, creatinine; X-ray L wrist, clinical photos - X-ray changes of rickets - osteopenia, metaphyseal widening/splaying/fraying Treatment - Children with low vitamin D should be treated (see table below) to restore their levels to the normal range (50 nmol/L) - There is limited evidence to support high dose treatment in infants <3 months - Ensure adequate calcium intake (see calcium intake table below) . Cheese, yoghurt and fortified soy dairy are useful sources of calcium in children who dislike cow milk. Consider supplements if poor intake - Education on sun protection and exposure (see sun exposure table below). Children/young people with dark skin can tolerate intermittent sun exposure without sunscreen, although hats/sunglasses are still recommended - Children with nutritional rickets should be managed under specialist guidance. The minimum recommended dose of vitamin D is 2000 units daily for minimum of 3 months, together with oral calcium 500 mg daily (either via diet or supplements).
