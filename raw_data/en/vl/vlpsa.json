Here are some important facts about hospice: The focus is on comfort (palliative care), not curing an illness. Services typically include physical care, counseling, drugs, equipment, and supplies for the terminal illness and related conditions. A specially trained team of professionals and caregivers provide care for the \"whole person,\" including physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs. Care is generally given in the home. Family caregivers can get support. Hospice isn't only for people with cancer. Palliative care Palliative care is the part of hospice care that focuses on helping people who are terminally ill and their families maintain their quality of life. If you're terminally ill, palliative care can address your physical, intellectual, emotional, social, and spiritual needs. Palliative care supports your independence, access to information, and ability to make choices about your health care. Words in blue are defined on pages 15-16. 5 Care for a condition other than your terminal illness Your hospice benefit covers care for your terminal illness and related conditions. Once you start getting hospice care, Original Medicare will cover everything you need related to your terminal illness, even if you remain in a Medicare Advantage Plan or other Medicare health plan . After your hospice benefit starts, you can still get covered services for conditions not related to your terminal illness. Original Medicare will pay for covered services for any health problems that aren't part of your terminal illness and related conditions. However, you must pay the deductible and coinsurance amounts for all Medicare-covered services you get to treat health problems that aren't part of your terminal illness and related conditions. Important: If you were in a Medicare Advantage Plan before starting hospice care, and decide to stay in that plan, you can get covered services for any health problems that aren't part of your terminal illness and related conditions. For more information on hospice care if you're in a Medicare Advantage Plan or other Medicare health plan, go to page 10 . Note: You can ask your hospice provider for a list of items, services, and drugs that they've determined aren't related to your terminal illness and related conditions. This list must include why they made that determination. Your hospice provider is also required to give this list to your non-hospice providers or Medicare if requested. Words in blue are defined on pages 15-16. 6 How your hospice benefit works If you qualify for hospice care, you and your family will work with your hospice provider to set up a plan of care that meets your needs.

For more specific information on a hospice plan of care, call your state hospice organization. Visit Medicare.gov/talk-to-someone , or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) to find the number for your state hospice organization. TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048.

A hospice doctor is part of your medical team. You can choose to include your regular doctor, a nurse practitioner, or a physician assistant on your medical team as the attending medical professional. The hospice benefit allows you and your family to stay together in the comfort of your home, unless you need care in an inpatient facility. If your hospice provider decides you need inpatient hospice care, your hospice provider will make the arrangements for your stay. Words in blue are defined on pages 15-16. 7 Who's eligible for the hospice benefit If you have Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) AND meet all of these conditions, you can get hospice care: Your hospice doctor and your regular doctor (if you have one) certify that you're terminally ill (you're expected to live 6 months or less). You accept comfort care (palliative care) instead of care to cure your illness. You sign a statement choosing hospice care instead of other Medicare-covered treatments for your terminal illness and related conditions.

What your hospice benefit won't cover When you start hospice care, you've decided that you no longer want care to cure your terminal illness and related conditions, and/or your doctor has determined that efforts to cure your illness aren't working.

Your hospice benefit doesn't cover room and board. However, if the hospice team determines you need short-term inpatient or respite care services that they arrange, Medicare will cover your stay in the facility. You may have to pay a small copayment for the respite stay. Words in blue are defined on pages 15-16. 10 What your hospice benefit won't cover (continued) Care you get as a hospital outpatient (like in an emergency room), care you get as a hospital inpatient, or ambulance transportation, unrelated to your terminal illness and related conditions, unless your hospice team arranges it. Note: Contact your hospice team before you get any of these services, or you might have to pay the full cost.

If you paid a copayment under Original Medicare, keep your receipts. Your plan must reimburse you for the extra amount you paid. If your Medicare Advantage Plan offers a Part D prescription drug benefit, you're covered by the plan for drugs not related to your terminal illness.

Your hospice benefit will cover the cost of your inpatient hospital care and pay your hospice provider. Since the hospice provider and the hospital have a contract, they work out the payment between them. However, if you go to the hospital and your hospice provider didn't make the arrangements, you might be responsible for the entire cost of your hospital care. How long you can get hospice care Hospice care is for people with a life expectancy of 6 months or less (if the illness runs its normal course). If you live longer than 6 months, you can still get hospice care as long as the hospice medical director or other hospice doctor recertifies that you're terminally ill. Hospice care is given in benefit periods. You can get hospice care for two 90-day benefit periods followed by an unlimited number of 60-day benefit periods. A benefit period starts the day you begin to get hospice care, and it ends when your 90-day or 60-day benefit period ends. At the start of the first 90-day benefit period, your hospice doctor and your regular doctor (if you have one) must certify that you're terminally ill (with a life expectancy of 6 months or less). Important: At the start of each benefit period after the first 90-day benefit period, the hospice medical director or other hospice doctor must recertify that you're terminally ill, so you can continue to get hospice care. Once your hospice benefit starts, you don't need to \"re-choose\" hospice care for each new benefit period. Note: You have the right to change your hospice provider once during each benefit period. Words in blue are defined on pages 15-16. 13 Stopping hospice care If your health improves or your illness goes into remission, you may no longer need hospice care. You always have the right to stop hospice care at any time. If you choose to stop hospice care, the hospice provider will ask you to sign a form that includes the date your care will end. No one should ask you to sign any forms about stopping your hospice care at the time you start hospice. Stopping hospice care is a choice only you can make, and you shouldn't sign or date any forms until the actual date you want your hospice care to stop. If you were in Original Medicare when you decided to stop hospice care, you can continue in Original Medicare. If you're eligible, you can go back to hospice care at any time. If you were in a Medicare Advantage Plan when you started hospice, you can stay in that plan while getting hospice care by continuing to pay your plan's premiums .
