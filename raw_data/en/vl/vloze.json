Further guidance for bulk variations is available at the end of this page. - Standard fees will be charged where the application is concerned with the introduction of new suppliers of defined simple Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) only. Further information: Fees for New Suppliers of Defined Simple Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients. 37.1 Bulk fee reductions Terminology - Lead Case: the first Licence listed on the application form of a specific variation - Bulk Case: each additional licence included in the application form of a specific variation Reductions for 'bulks' of single or group variations are available. You must meet the following criteria: - the changes are to authorisations registered under the same company number - the changes are identical across the lead and bulk members, and rely on the same supporting data. (QRD updates to the SPC do not need to meet this requirement) - the authorisations included are not a combination of Mutual Recognition and National licences Complex variations are subject to different bulk fee reductions Each bulk case included in the variation carries a 50% reduced fee of the full specified fee for the lead case. The fee type for the lead case is dependent upon the type of submission (grouping/single), the category of variation (Type 1A/1B/2) and procedure type of MA (National/MRP or CMS). IMPORTANT: Type IB or Type II variations that include any Type IA changes require a grouped fee according the highest classification of change. Variations in this format supported by a proof of payment for a single fee (or other lesser fee) will be invalidated. Example 1: National Procedures Type IB National - lead case - \u00a3344. Minor variation (type IB) grouped - lead case - \u00a3684. Example 2: Mutual Recognition Procedure. CMS major variation (type II) Grouped lead case - \u00a31,255. Complex Variations The lead case incurs a type II complex or extended complex fee, each bulk member is charged at the relevant single type II fee (national or CMS). Grouped Complex Variations The lead case incurs a 'type II grouped complex' or 'extended grouped complex fee' and each bulk member is charged at the type II group major bulk fee (national or CMS). 38.

We are therefore publishing an extract from the MHRA fees legislation The Medicines (Products for Human Use)(Fees) Regulations 2010 S.I No 551 which defines each of the different types of application: See [MHRA fees definitions](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mhra-fees) for information. Clarification of terminology relating to periodic fees: you might find it useful to refer to the [terminology relating to periodic fees](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mhra-fees) from The Medicines (Products for Human Use)(Fees) Regulations 2010 S.I No 551.
