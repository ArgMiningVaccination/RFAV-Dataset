Not only is it one of the most commonly quoted motives for Westerners for participating in ayahuasca ceremonies, but most elements of an ayahuasca ceremony are aimed to heal and protect. This article is purely ethnographic, and its purpose is to provide insight into the ways healing is conceived by both ayahuasqueros and Western participants in the context of shamanic tourism in Iquitos, Peru. I show that illness is perceived to have physical, psychological, and spiritual dimensions, and healing is a complex process that takes place in and outside of ceremony. I show that a multitude of elements in a ceremony converge to address all three dimensions of illness, one of the most important ones being the element of personal crisis. Often present in healing narratives, the element of crisis becomes the catalyst for positive transformation, including physical, psychological, and spiritual healing. Rather than being seen as a singular event, healing in this context is seen as a process, in which the patient carries the responsibility for their own healing. keywords: healing, ritual, shamanism, ayahuasca, Amazonia & introduction Ayahuasca is above all, -the great medicine -Schultes of Consciousness Issue 1, pp. 6 -27, ISSN 1053-4202, \u00a92012 by the American Anthropological Association. All rights reserved DOI: 10.1111/j.1556-3537.2012.01054.x 6 The above sentiment was expressed by the majority of my consultants, as ayahuasca was rarely referred to by its name; rather, it was referred to as \"medi- cine \"or\"medicina, \"especially by experienced users. The following is based on data collected during 17 months of dissertation fieldwork between 2003 and 2005 and a short trip in the summer of 2007, in and around the jungle town ofIquitos, Peru. The central goal of my research was to examine the ways inwhich ayahuasca is constructed and perceived by Westerners in the context ofshamanic tourism. I chose Iquitos as a research site because, as a gateway tothe eco- and shamanic tourism in the area, it serves as a location where differ-ent cultural constructions of ayahuasca coexist, namely the urban mestizo useand the Western one, creating a unique cultural milieu. I participated in over60 ayahuasca ceremonies in various contexts, including some retreats that spe-cialize in ayahuasca tourism. I did not work with one ayahuasquero throughoutmy fieldwork, nor did I become an apprentice, because I wanted to get a betterfeel of the different contexts in which ayahuasca was administered and wantedto include multiple perspectives in my dissertation. I worked with nineayahuasqueros, interviewed 82 participants (mostly Westerners), and had infor-mal conversations with several dozen more. In this article, I will present theways that healing was perceived in this context both by ayahuasqueros and byWestern participants, creating a unique and dynamic model. Althoughthe topic has been discussed in recent publications (Beyer 2009), there are fewin-depth ethnographic studies of shamanic tourism available. Many cultures attribute illness to a psycho-physiological disequilibrium in the human organism, which may include a social element. This is no differentincuranderismo , 1where the root of disease is located in the spiritual as well as social sphere. To treat illness, the curandero employs a variety of methods, such as prayers, icaros, massages, sucking, blowing, smoke, incense, oils, perfumes,and plant essences. Often, Peruvian externalizing explanatory models place thecause of a patient 's problem outside of themselves and treatment requires manipulation of forces external to the patient \u2014at least in Western eyes they are perceived as external even though it could be argued that it is not necessar-ily so for the ayahuasqueros. Sorcery or spirits can be responsible for disease,and ayahuasqueros manipulate these forces and treat external cosmological aswell as social problems. As Lenaerts argues when discussing Ash\u00e9ninka explan-atory models, illness is perceived to be due to a problem \"within the complex network of intertwined wills that interconnects all living beings \"(2006:62). During my research, I observed that locals did not visit ayahuasqueros for illness that is easily explained as a result of natural causes, such as flu,infection, and so forth. In fact, many people are knowledgeable enough toself-medicate using plants. One also has the option of visiting the plant mar-ket or the Western pharmacy to obtain remedies for such ailments. Localswould attend ayahuasca ceremonies for healing when they suffered fromworking with \"la medicina \" 7general malaise that could not be explained as anything other than a sorcery induced illness; in other words, the result of shamanic intervention by amalevolent shaman or the result of envidia (envy). On the other hand, Westerners tended to seek the source, as well as the solution, to their problems inside of themselves. In this healing paradigm,the responsibility for healing is placed on the individual. However, they didrecognize that some of their troubles might have originated because of socie-tal influences and former life experiences, for instance childhood trauma. Itwas perceived that the cause of the disequilibrium in the body was not theexternal factors per se but rather the way the individual responded to them.With ayahuasca they sought to detoxify themselves from the negative feelingsthat they were still holding onto from societal influences or childhoodtrauma and create the conditions for successful healing. What seemed to draw Westerners to shamanism as a more desirable healing tool was that it addresses the spiritual dimension of healing, alongwith the physical. It is perceived that many diseases in the West come from aspiritual disconnect from nature, other human beings, and archaic modes ofthought that ayahuasca could help remedy. One Westerner, who had justarrived to Iquitos seeking healing with a local ayahuasquero, said that she\"had been led there \"after an encounter with a healer on the coast of Peru who had told her that she had a \"fragmented psyche. \"Often, the spiritual component of healing had larger ramifications for Westerners as it wasperceived that individual healing would in turn contribute to the collectivehealing of humanity. This interest in the spiritual concerns of the patient is not unlike other alternative healing modalities familiar to Westerners. Alternative healingmethods, such as Reiki, were often employed during ayahuasca ceremonies.Although an increasing number of psychologists and medical doctors in theWest are starting to recognize the importance of the inclusion of spiritualconcerns for patients 'healing and well-being, all my consultants found that biomedicine is lacking in this respect. In fact, their engagement with sha-manism was often an implicit critique of biomedicine. What makes ayahuasca such an encompassing healing tool is the holistic approach of ayahuasca shamanism, its attempt to treat the whole person.One of the ayahuasqueros I worked with used to say that ayahuasca is \"the best psychologist in the world \"; indeed many Westerners that seek ayahuasca today do so for psychological healing, and some have benefitted from it. Thesame ayahuasquero also emphasized, before most ceremonies, that ayahuascahas three parts, meaning it works on three levels: the physical, the psycholog-ical, and the spiritual. Using this model, shamans can claim that they canheal anything, from cancer to a fragmented soul. It is important to note that,8 anthropology of consciousness 23.1according to this model, the physical, psychological, and spiritual are inter- twined rather than being seen as separate realms. The elements described in the next section are meant to address all three dimensions of healing and contribute to healing and protection. Most cere- monies I attended involving Western participants focused on psychologicaland spiritual healing and growth. Sometimes there were participants whorequired special attention because they were trying to heal something spe-cific, whereas other times there was an underlying intent to heal. & elements of healing in ayahuasca ceremonies Ayahuasca is the first element I will discuss and the one that everything else revolves around in ceremonies. Ayahuasca is not only the means to achieveanother state of consciousness; rather, it is considered itself a healing plant,\"the mother of all plants. \"Curanderos in the area claim to be able to heal all forms of illness with ayahuasca, from cancer to AIDS. Reality is not asstraightforward, as there is no consistent evidence that supports this, apartfrom anecdotal reports. Although there is indication that ayahuasca containsalkaloids that help with anxiety and depression 2(Santos et al. 2007), it is important that more research is done in this respect to determine the exis-tence of alkaloids beneficial for other conditions. Dosage of the brew varies among shamans. Most would say that they administered the dosage indicated by the spirits. Only one ayahuasquera saidthat she had a standard dose of 50 milliliters that she gave to all participantsunless they experienced no effect with this dose. Additionally, she wouldoffer a second dose later in the ceremony to anyone who requested it.Another ayahuasquera had three different bottles of ayahuasca in front of her,and she mixed brew from all three of them in every glass she served. Later,she told me that the ayahuasca brew in the three bottles was from differentbatches. She said that she liked doing it this way, instead of mixing the batchesahead of time, as other ayahuasqueros do. Having tried the ayahuasca brewfrom each batch before she gave it to people, she had a sense of which one togive to each participant. She also administered different quantities and hadtwo different size glasses for this purpose. Most of the ayahuasqueros I worked with did not make extensive use of plants besides ayahuasca to heal patients. It was believed that invoking thespirits of the plants and their energy in ceremony is enough to heal, hencethe physical plant is not necessary. This is not unique; Lenaerts (2006) whendiscussing the Ash\u00e9ninka argues that an ayahuasquero is not necessarily agood botanist. Their job is to manage a network of personal relationshipsinvolving all living beings. He also found that most \"lay\"people had detailedworking with \"la medicina \" 9knowledge of herbs. This is consistent with my findings. One ayahuasquera used a set number of plants during the time I was there for a variety of issuesor ailments \u2014including treating drug addiction \u2014one piri (Cyperus articulatus ). Many ayahuasqueros used a variety of aromatic plants and flowers in ba\u00f1os de flores (flower baths) that were usually administered in the daytime before ceremonies. The client would be given a plastic tubwith water in which a mixture of flowers, herbs, and some cologne werediluted. The patient was supposed to pour this over their body to cleanse andprotect themselves from sorcery. Mapacho (Nicotiana rustica ) is used throughout the region during the preparation of the ayahuasca brew as well as during the ceremony. It is con-sidered a very powerful spirit, and as one of my consultants told me, pointingto the bundle of mapacho cigarettes that he had lined up for ceremony, onecannot be a shaman if they are not willing to smoke several mapacho ciga-rettes during the ceremony. During the ayahuasca preparation, mapachosmoke is blown on the pot where the ayahuasca is cooking to bless the brew.Mapacho is also blown on the plants that are going to be used before theyare harvested and before they are placed in the pot. At the beginning of theceremony, ayahuasqueros blow smoke in the four directions for protectionand to establish the ceremonial space. During the ceremony, mapacho isblown on the bottle of ayahuasca, each individual cup serving of the brew, aswell as on ceremonial objects and participants. Several things are used in ceremony for extra protection and cleansing. One of them is Agua Florida ,o r Agua de Florida 3(literally flowered water), which is used by almost all the ayahuasqueros I worked with in the area. It isfirst used on the body of the ayahuasquero, usually the neck, face, and arms,for protection at the beginning of the ceremony, and then it is passed to allparticipants and applied to their body with the same intent. Plastic bottleswith items preserved in aguardiente 4for their protective and healing powers are used similarly in ceremony. One of the most common ones is alcanfor (camphor), and I have seen some ayahuasqueros use certain types of onionsand garlic, preserved in aguardiente, in the same way. Typically, they hold asmall amount of the aguardiente in their mouth and blow it on their bodyfor protection before the ceremony. Some will pass it around to the partici-pants who wish to do the same. Alcanfor will also be applied on the bodyaround the neck and arms for protection. In addition, smelling the camphorfrom the bottle right after drinking the brew will cleanse one 's palate and suppress the urge to vomit. In some rare cases, Palo Santo was used during a ceremony as incense. Palo Santo, or holy wood, is the wood of the Bursera graveolens orBursera microphylla tree (R\u00e4tsch 2005). It can be bought at the market in small pieces and can be burned to smoke or smudge the room at the beginning of10 anthropology of consciousness 23.1a ceremony. The pleasant smell it emits makes it desirable by some people, but it was not often used in the ceremonies I attended. It was regularly usedby one ayahuasquero who also used essential oils, while other times I have seen it used by some of the participants. The schacapa is another very important healing tool for shamans. It is a rattle that consists of a bundle of leaves from the Pariana spp. palm. It might appear that its sole purpose is to provide a monotonous sound during the cer-emony, but it is much more than that. It is used to direct energy to where itis needed or to remove negative energy from the patient 's body. Only one ayahuasquero and his apprentice did not use a schacapa of this type in theirceremonies. Instead they used a bundle of leaves from the ruda 5plant. They used it the same way as the common schacapa, but it is not as loud and hasa discreet and pleasant smell. They preferred to use ruda because it has theability to absorb any negative energies from the patient. Both schacapas areused in ceremony in similar ways. While the ayahuasquero sings, they shakethe schacapa producing a monotonous sound that accompanies the icaros,while when they perform an individual healing, they tap the patient 's body with it. The sensation of tapping the schacapa on the crown of the head canbe very soothing. When the ceremony is lead by multiple ayahuasquerosand several schacapas are used at the same time, the effect can be quiteimpressive. Most of the ayahuasqueros I worked with did not use musical instruments in their ceremonies, although some have started to include them, takingadvantage of the healing effects of sound. One of the European ayahuasquer-os I worked with used to play the flute toward the end of the ceremony aswell as used a bell. In another ceremony lead by an apprentice of a differentayahuasquero, who did not observe the exact protocol of his teacher 's cere- mony, participants were allowed to play instruments toward the end of theceremony, while in another, someone brought a didgeridoo that he playedafter the ceremony was closed. One of the ayahuasqueros also used a rainstick, which made a very impressive sound during ayahuasca ceremonies.Only one ayahuasquero did not use a schacapa at all. She used other instru-ments, panpipes, rattles, and a drum, but only toward the end of theceremony. One ayahuasquero also used magical stones, known as encantos orpeder- nales , in his ceremonies. Along with his other ceremonial objects, he had a stone that was given to him a long time ago that was supposed to absorb dis-ease and negative energies. His apprentice also had a stone, a smaller one,which she used to treat patients. These stones are believed to be special inthat they contain genios (spirits) much like plants and animals. This ayahuas- quero told me that he uses his stone to take away pain or disease from a spe-cific spot. He placed it on a part that hurt, and according to the way theworking with \"la medicina \" 11stone sweat, he knew what to do. He and his apprentice claimed to have healed people of serious chronic conditions. Mesas , or ceremonial altars, are not as common in Amazonia as they are in Andean traditions. All the above ceremonial objects are usually kept some- where during the days that they are not used and are placed in front of theayahuasquero without much ceremony. However, a few ayahuasqueros arestarting to create mesas, some temporary and some more permanent. In oneretreat, I was told that they received the message from the spirits to create amesa with a variety of objects, which are meant to provide protection,defense, and power, or are symbolic of something that will. In this case, themesa was permanent and it was in the ceremonial house. Another ayahuas-quero, who held ceremonies at his house and did not have the space for apermanent mesa, put one together just before the ceremony in front of hisseat. In both cases, everything was placed on a decorated cloth, which repre-sented the ceremonial space (Figure 1). In the ayahuasca retreat with a permanent mesa, on the periphery of the cloth were a number of big white crystals that represented \"dimensional gateways. \"I was told that their cracks can take one to other dimensions and they represent the \"crystal palace in which the shamans work. \"Other objects on the mesa included a number of crystals, semiprecious stones, and a bigpiece of amber that represent different elements and their powers; two bells figure 1. temporary mesa used d u r i n ga na y a h u a s c ac e r e m o n y held at the ayahuasquero 's house (photo by author, april 2005).12 anthropology of consciousness 23.1that are used to clear a patient 's energy; two eagle feathers and a condor feather that embody the qualities of these birds; some figurines that symbol-izepachamama (Mother Earth in Quechua) and other spirits that were con- sidered powerful; some shells that represent the ocean, including a big shell from the Andes that they blow at the beginning of the ceremony to call thespirits; a mortar and pestle with some saw dust and herbs that represent themedicine that they practice; a row of crystal balls that are used for divinationand represent the planets; and a stone artifact, which was used by indigenouspeople, with a hole in the middle fitted at the end of a stick as a weaponand represented protection. Finally, there were a couple of meteorites thatrepresented space. All these different elements were meant to represent differ-ent parts of the cosmos. Another element of healing in this shamanic tradition is the soplos or sopladas , which involve blowing healing energy on a patient. This is an inte- gral part of ceremonies but is also used as a healing tool on its own. Forexample, an ayahuasquero might determine that they have to perform sopla-das every day on a patient for a period of time until they show improvement.What is physically blown on the patient is mapacho smoke, but I was toldthat at the same time shamans blow \"medicine \"that resides in their body. Curanderos acquire spiritual force or medicine as it was called by others,which normally resides in their body, during their training and diets. Duringceremonies, they can blow (soplar) this medicine into the patient and changetheir condition or heal them. During the ceremony, curanderos will blowsmoke on the crown of the head, the back, and the hands of the participantafter they drink the ayahuasca. In some cases, they will repeat it during theceremony when they perform a personal healing on the person. Sucking, or chupada , is another element that is important in removing negative energies or disease from the body, but it was not used as widely assoplada in the context of tourism. Although it is a very important part ofindigenous Amazonian shamanism, I have only seen it used on three occa-sions by two ayahuasqueros with whom I worked around Iquitos. The firsttime the ayahuasquero was trying to remove sorcery from a local woman, thesecond time the ayahuasquero was healing a local woman of suspected sor-cery, and the third time the ayahuasquero treated me and a local friend andsucked from my belly button for a few minutes. What is sucked out of thebody is the physical manifestation of disease or, in cases of sorcery, the illwill of a sorcerer, which can take the form of a variety of objects such astwigs, worms, feathers, or stones. Purification and cleansing are instrumental in ayahuasca healing. First, there are certain dietary restrictions that are meant to keep the body purebefore the ceremony. The diet requires refraining from spices, sugar, salt,oils, meat (especially pork, which is to be avoided for 30 days after the lastworking with \"la medicina \" 13ceremony), stimulants, and sex. Pork is to be avoided because of its \"dirty energy, \"especially its fat. Diet is very important in other shamanic traditions as well. Siikala (1992:213) mentions that Siberian shamans fast, meditate, and go into seclusion before ceremonies. Amazonian shamans also fast during their apprenticeship and practice sexual abstinence. Following a specific dietis very important, as in many Amazonian societies illness is considered to bethe result of breaking food taboos, of which there are many (Hugh-Jones1979). The diet includes abstinence from sex for a few days before the ritual and eight days afterwards. The idea behind this is that the plants remainin one 's system for days after the ceremony and will continue to work and heal or teach the person, provided that they stay pure. Although Icould not get a consensus from my consultants on the reasons behindsome of the rules, most shamans agreed on the prohibitions themselves.The only disagreement was on the topic of fruit. While most shamanswould allow fruit to be consumed, one particular ayahuasquero would notallow them because they contain sugar. On the day of the ceremony, oneis not supposed to eat anything after noon, and it is suggested to eat alight meal or just fruit and drink herbal teas. On the day following theceremony, one is not supposed to eat or use soap or toothpaste beforenoon. Some ayahuasqueros have a particular way to \"break \"the diet on the following day, which usually involves salt and lemon taken directlyunder the tongue. One prohibition that is not very popular is the sexual abstinence rule. Ayahuasqueros would have different theories as to why sex is prohibited, aswell as different observation approaches. A Western ayahuasquero said thathe had been taught the spirit of ayahuasca is very jealous and does not wantpeople to have sex when it resides in their body. In his opinion, and from aWestern point of view, the rationale behind the prohibition is because sex isa\"very strong, very open, energetic exchange. \"The energies of the persons interfere with each other, and it can \"defocus \"someone who is dieting and doing spiritual work. He added that he did not exclude the possibility thatthis taboo was a Catholic influence. As mentioned, participants are encouraged to keep the diet for some time after the ceremony, as the medicine continues to be in the body; in order forit to continue working, the body needs to remain pure. If the diet is broken,the healing or spiritual work stops and sometimes worse things can happen.Peruvian consultants have told me that they got skin rashes from breakingthe diet. Ayahuasqueros and patients are known to be \"punished \"by the spirits for not following the dietary restrictions. In one ceremony, a youngman that had eaten a full meal in the afternoon of the day of the ritualinsisted on drinking ayahuasca with the rest of the group despite the warning14 anthropology of consciousness 23.1of the ayahuasquero. After much persistence he was allowed to drink, but during the ceremony he had a truly hard time \u2014vomiting and generally feel- ing sick \u2014as well as having unpleasant and scary visions. The ayahuasquero pointed out to him several times during the ceremony that ayahuasca was punishing him for not having fasted. On occasion, I have witnessed other plants used to purify the body before an ayahuasca ceremony. This is usually done in the morning of the day ofthe ceremony. These plants will induce vomiting or diarrhea or both. Onone occasion, the latex of the ojeplant ( Ficus insipida ) was used to induce powerful purging. Oje is quite toxic and a large quantity of water needs to bedrunk with it to avoid poisoning. On another occasion, an ayahuasquera gavepi\u00f1ones blancos (probably the nut of the Jatropha curcas ) to a large group of tourists at an ayahuasca retreat. Most people retired in their individual rooms,but throughout the day one could hear the purging sounds all over thecamp. One of the guests said jokingly that the ayahuasquero was a naughtywitch and had created a \"vomit camp. \"The ayahuasquera told me that she did this so people would have less to purge during ceremony and would\"suffer less. \" Purging is a rather central aspect of ayahuasca ceremonies. When I asked one of my consultants if he usually vomits during ceremonies, he said hekeeps the medicine down as long as it is still medicine; then he vomits whenit\"stops being medicine. \"Another participant said that one time when she tried to vomit, it was \"like giving birth to a very strange and ugly creature from the mouth. \"Another shared that when she vomited she saw spirits that were encouraging her and sometimes seemed to be waiting to collect whatshe vomited. She felt that the reason they were there was to collect it. Vomit-ing is not the only way to purge; one of the ayahuasqueros I worked withsaid that yawning is also cleansing and that crying is the best form of cleans-ing because it is cleansing at the emotional level as well. Sweating is alsocleansing as are other bodily sensations. For example, during a series of cere-monies I felt feverish, but when I told the ayahuasquero about this, he saidthat this is a wonderful way of cleansing and he sometimes felt like that him-self. One of the participants I interviewed described his purging experiencelike this: During the vomiting, I felt like my skin had turned red and bat wings had appeared in my back. When I vomited, I felt like I was cleansingmyself and throwing out all the shit I had inside: physical, emotional,psychological. I kind of saw that when I vomited, during the act ofvomiting, my skin turned from red to pink and then white, I wantedwhite, so I wanted to vomit, I didn 't want to be a \"demon, \"I wanted to be an \"angel \". . . I could feel the shit been sucked from my toe, comingworking with \"la medicina \" 15up and accumulating and then thrown out to the bucket. I wanted to be white, not red. [Research Data, April 2005] A very important element in an ayahuasca ceremony is the spirits, also called \"doctors, \"ordoctorcitos . The ayahuasqueros have a special relation- ship with certain spirits with which they work closely. Participants alsoreport encountering spirit doctors who manipulate their body with the pur-pose of healing them. Ayahuasqueros might employ spirits for future protec- tion and consult them to heal a patient. The spirits tell them what to do, for example, if they need to direct energy to a person with the schacapa,tell them when enough energy has been directed to a person, and helpmanage the chaos of energy that might ensue during the ceremony. Eachplant, human, or object has multiple spirits that are arranged hierarchically.When invoking a spirit, the shamans call the chief spirit of each plant ormadre de la planta . The madres determine what is needed and send the appropriate spirit to each person. I was often told that one has to be recep-tive to receive help from the spirits. Although participants often discussed the healing process in terms of \"becoming their own shaman, \"it is often with the help of these spirits and after being able to \"open up \"to the spirit world that successful heal- ing can take place. Some interviewees have described quite dramatic inter-actions with the spirits that assist in their healing. One of them said thatonce the spirits performed open-heart surgery on him. He believed thatthe visions are like anesthesia and are meant to distract someone whilethey are doing their healing work. This idea, that the visions are really adistraction and not the actual purpose of the ayahuasca experience, wasshared by many. Navigating the visionary experience can be tricky formany reasons. One of the ayahuasqueros said that sometimes spirits offerthings to the participants. Before a ceremony, he said that if these spiritsoffer flowers, stones, or fruit participants could accept them, but warnedthem not to take anything red or black because these are things associatedwith sorcery. Spirits are very important when it comes to recuperating soul fragments, which was perceived as a very common condition and a result of modernlifestyle. Participants were encouraged to ask the spirits to bring back the frag-ments of their soul. People were encouraged to ask the spirits for help, andthey were assured that they would provide guidance. They were also told toask for what they want to get rid of to be taken away or ask for what theywanted to be done on them directly from the spirits. During the ceremony,they were also told to let go of anything that does not serve them, and theayahuasqueros would handle that energy and send it away.16 anthropology of consciousness 23.1& icaros An important element that deserves a longer discussion is the icaros , the power and healing songs that are sung throughout the ceremony and havebeen studied extensively (Dobkin are the vehicle through which theayahuasquero will infuse an object or the brew with power \u2014whether heal- ing, cleansing, or harmful \u2014and transmit this energy to the patient. There are icaros that are meant to do a variety of things such as heal, protect, anddefend against enemies; call the mareaci\u00f3n 6; call the mareac- i\u00f3n away; remove negative energy; and even win the love of a woman ( huar- mi icaros ). Another purpose is communicating with the spirits of the plants invoked in the icaros. By invoking them, icaros contain the powers of thehealing or curative plants. At the beginning of the ceremony, ayahuasquerossing icaros in the individual servings of the brew using the name of the par-ticipants for their protection and to solicit a certain outcome. Then theyinvoke the mareaci\u00f3n as well as the plant and animal spirits and put theircurative powers inside the patients 'bodies. I was told that during the cere- mony sometimes patients feel stronger while other times they may initiallyfeel weaker because the power of the spirits combats the spirit of the patientwhile at the same time strengthening it. Most ayahuasqueros advised partici-pants to concentrate on the icaros during the ceremony, especially if theywere having a hard time or were afraid. One ayahuasquero said that the ica-ros in themselves are 100 percent healing ( cien porciento curativos ). A very common phenomenon related to the icaros is that of synesthesia, where participants say they can literally \"see\"the music. Every time there is a change in song the visions change. In fact, it is said that ayahuasqueroscan move or manipulate a person 's visions or state of mind by using different icaros at different times or change the overall energy and feeling of the cere-mony. I have attended ceremonies where the energy of the icaros was verypowerful and others where it was calm, and this affected how people reacted.What is important here, and causes these dramatic changes, are not thewords of the icaro, which tend to be repetitive and variations of the samethemes, but the intonation in which they are sang. Some icaros might bewhistled or whispered, especially at the beginning of the ceremony whenthey want to attract the spirits, while they can become much more intenselater in the ceremony. The icaros are said to be given to ayahuasqueros directly by the spirits during their apprenticeship, in ceremony, or when dieting, and in the course of their lives they might accumulate more icaros. Icaros are learned directly from the spirits; shamans hear the icaros from the plants, and they are told toworking with \"la medicina \" 17follow them. They also learn and receive the icaros of their teacher, which they learn and follow during their apprenticeship. This is what an ethnog-rapher Angelika Gebhart-Sayer (1986) had to say about the transmission of icaros from the spirits to the ayahuasquero: Under Ayahuasca influence, the shaman perceives, from the spirit world, incomprehensible, often chaotic, information in the form of luminousdesigns. He then \"domesticates \"this information by converting it into various aesthetic notions: geometric patterns, melodies/rhythm andfragrance which play a key psychological and spiritual role for both thepatient and society. Only through this mediating step the awesome andincomprehensible become applicable corpues of shamanic cognitionsuitable for the mundane village. [Luna 1986:62] Ownership of the icaros is important and the fear that others will copy their icaros is very common among ayahuasqueros (some will not allow recordingof the ceremonies for this reason). The more common strategy used to avoidcopying of the icaros is using a mix of words from native languages, especiallyQuechua, or what they call spirit language that is difficult to decipher andcopy. I was told by an ayahuasquero that, if I wanted to be a shaman, I shoulduse as many obscure words as possible, to make my icaros more powerful andmore difficult for others to learn. One ayahuasquero used words from Spanish,Quechua, Shipibo, Campa, and Urarina in her icaros. Another used a mix-ture of Cocama, Spanish, and Quechua. In addition, at the end of familiarwords ayahuasqueros add a short suffix that usually does not add a particularmeaning to the word and sometimes was referred to as \"spirit language. \"I was told that the meaning of a word is not as important as the feeling of it; theway the ayahuasquero feels at the moment is what determines the words. Forexample, the word soplarenge , which is repeated in many icaros, comprised by the Spanish word sopla (blow) and the suffix renge , which is very common, inserted by the ayahuasquero. Another common suffix is ini. On the other hand, I was told by the most respected ayahuasquero in the area that it is not enough to learn an icaro and sing it. Each icaro has a par-ticular power or energy that can only be transmitted by the master ayahuas-quero to the apprentice by will or by the spirits themselves \u2014when they give the icaro to the ayahuasquero. Therefore, although someone can copy some-one 's icaros and sing them in ceremony, these icaros have no power and therefore are not able to heal, protect, or perform any other function. \"The icaros come from inside the body of the shaman, \"one ayahuasquero told me showing his belly. He added that he uses some of the icaros of his teacher aswell as his own. He explained that he took the base (spinal cord as he put it)from his teacher and developed his own ritual. This is very common in18 anthropology of consciousness 23.1shamanism. There is a degree of following tradition and a lot of room for each individual ayahuasquero 's creativity. I was also told that there are icaros that one ayahuasquero can sing better than others because they created them and \"own \"their energy. In addition, shamans feel every person 's energy and can take the same icaro to a different direction, something that someonewho does not own the icaro cannot do. An example of an icaro I recorded shows the type of language used in it: cielo, cielo ayahuascacitoini Calling cielo Calling to the mother cogocito To the budding leaf growthflorcitangi oloroso cuerpocito ini To the fragrant flowers to ayahuascacitoini Calling to the budding leaf growthflorcitangi oloroso cuerpocito ini fragrant flowers to the Data, July 2007] An icaro can last for up to an hour or longer. However, some ayahuasquer- os sing icaros that are shorter with a more standardized structure resemblingsongs. This might be a new development due to tourism as some ayahuasqu-eros record their icaros and sell them to the tourists in the form of CDs.Below is an example of such icaro, the ayahuasquera invokes a variety of forces, including the mountain spirits of the Andean peoples, which she translated as \"father of nature \"(apu). She invokes the spirit doctors and the magical phlegm ( mariri ; also known as yachay ), among others. She also mentions the important ele- ments of the ritual, such as blowing smoke on the crown of the head andcleansing the body. It is often discussed around Iquitos that a particular ayahuasquero knows over a hundred or hundreds of icaros. The more icaros one knows the morepowerful they are considered, because that number indicates their long-last-ing relationship with the plant spirits. However, in the time that I was there,I only heard a limited number of icaros sang by each ayahuasquero, and infact there were quite a few similarities between ayahuasqueros. This mightbe because the vast majority of icaros are for special cases and they rarely getto be used, or it is possible that the claims of knowing a hundred icaros arean exaggeration in the first place. & the element of crisis as a step toward transformation Several ayahuasqueros point out that ayahuasca is not a medicine that will make you feel better right away; in fact one has to feel bad before they feelbetter. Paradoxically, this has not made ayahuasca unattractive to Westernerswho are believed to seek quick and easy fixes usually in pill form. On thecontrary, it was perceived that a sort of crisis had to occur before a successfulhealing. I was told that sometimes when one asks for the spirits 'help the immediate response is unpleasant because they bring in more energy thanthe body can handle, but after they pull negative things out, the person feelsbetter. In a manner of speaking, \"it gets worse before it gets better. \"This way, negative experiences become the springboard for healing and positivetransformation. This element of trial is ever present in interviews.20 anthropology of consciousness 23.1This rhetoric has many similarities to the New Age as discussed by Pike (2004). As biomedicine is perceived as limited, what is missing in Westernhealing practices is found in non-Western traditions. A common New Age belief is that people become ill when the body 's natural energy flow becomes blocked. Illness indicates that the spirit is out of place \u2014it can be argued that humans create their own illness. On the other hand, suffering and innerchaos are seen in a positive light as they provide opportunities for personalgrowth (Pike 2004:100). In healing narratives, there is often a crisis before thejourney (p. 110). Other important elements are that the ultimate responsibilityfor health is back to the individual (p. 109); the centrality of self-knowledgeand the inner realms of the self are the focus of healing work; and manyhealing stories describe pulling apart the self and putting it back together (p.111). Working with one 's energy is central in this model. Anything that puts one in an altered state of consciousness, such as ayahuasca, is believed to openup one 's energy, making it possible to remove blockages that one might not even know were there. Along these lines, all ayahuasqueros encourage partic-ipants to sit up in ceremony as this helps the energy flow in their body andwill prevent them from falling asleep, which is considered potentially danger-ous as it makes the person more vulnerable to attacks. In one retreat, in thebooklet provided to the participants there were a number of suggestions onhow to manipulate or ground their energy. The stage where all this happens is, of course, the body. Lenaerts points out that the ayahuasca sessions are \"first and foremost a bodily experience \" (2006:60). There is a very corporeal dimension in ayahuasca healing, empha-sized by purging, shaking, and other bodily sensations such as feelings ofcold. This corporeality, however, is seen as part of the three interconnecteddimensions in ayahuasca healing \u2014physical, psychological, spiritual. The aya- huasca experience is very intense on the body, although discussions wouldfocus on the visionary aspects of the experience. However, many shared thatthe visions are not the most important aspect of the experience for them. One particular ayahuasquero, working in a retreat center that focuses a lot on transformative work, explained their philosophy as follows. Both light anddarkness exist in the human body, but the darkness tends to hide the lightand people usually only see the darkness. This darkness comes from fears,traumas, fright, and negative thoughts. It is important for one to \"straighten their energy, \"and this can take a long time to achieve. Energy becomes \"crossed \"(cruzada ) from anger or negative thoughts, which people \"hold onto and do not let go. \"One way to combat this crossed energy is to \"love everything \"\u2014meaning the people and situations in their lives. People were also encouraged to establish straightening their energy as their intent beforeceremony as this was the foundation for everything else, such as healing andworking with \"la medicina \" 21transformation. I was told that it is not the ayahuasca that makes one nau- seous and sick during ceremony but the negative things residing in the body,such as anger, depression, sadness, and fear that resist leaving the body. This was echoed in the way people discussed someone who had a hard time in a ceremony. They would attribute their hardship to the fact that they hadmany negative things to purge. For example, I witnessed a ceremony inwhich a recently arrived young man from Europe participated. The rest ofthe group were experienced and had had several ceremonies together. Hisfirst ceremony was very difficult in the sense that he purged a lot and madevery loud noises. The following day, the consensus was that having just comefrom Europe, he was carrying a lot of negativity that he had to purge, espe-cially because of the lifestyle he lead there. It was generally thought thatonce the purging was over, ayahuasca would take that person to an ecstaticstate, a state that is easier for the person and during which helping spirits,medicine, and positive things may enter the body. In one retreat, participants were told to consider why they were holding onto something and explore whether it was serving them in some way. Forexample, it was believed that people often hold on to their anger becausepart of them does not want to let it go. The idea is that when one truly stopswanting it, the anger will go away. An example of how negative feelings workon the body is that fear will build up and cause a sugar craving, which weak-ens the energetic body. The more one straightens their energy through aya-huasca, the less the body craves things that weaken their energy, such asalcohol, coffee, and sugar. These cravings cause the crossed energy and theyare in turn caused by negative feelings. One can protect themselves fromsuch feelings and cravings by smudging, meditation, and concentration. A lotof human suffering was attributed to the fact that the darkness does not wantto leave the body and creates confusion. One ayahuasquera explained theeffect of negative feelings on the body thusly: It's quite known that nobody should hold on to rancor against anyone who insulted us. We shouldn 't carry any hatred or remorse. Because this makes us hurt ourselves, day by day, as if you were taking a drop ofpoison; the same way the body is poisoned by the hatred and the rancor.And from there come all the different types of diseases, even cancer. [Research Data, March 2005] The same ayahuasquera often encouraged participants to forgive anyone who had hurt them or wronged them in any way so they would not carry any ofthese negative feelings in their body. People were also encouraged to ask the spirits to release everything that is blocking them from loving themselves. Self-love was seen as a way to22 anthropology of consciousness 23.1transform and unblock energy and as a step to healing. Following, is part of a speech that an ayahuasquero gave during a ceremony that exemplifies thisidea: Everything you don 't want anymore, Give it back,Just give it back.It's that easy, just give it back. It's not scary it 's not hard. Just give it back.You can release it,Just give it back. Anything you don 't want anymore, Just give it back.It's super easy, Just give it back. You don 't want the anger, Give it back.Remember that there is good in you.Give it back. Whatever it is, Just give it back.You don 't need it anymore. You don 't want it anymore. Give it back. There is nothing you give you can 't get back. Give it back. This is not hard. You don 't have to fight. You don 't have to fight it in our- selves. You just have to give it back. Whatever it is Give it back.Whatever you don 't want anymore. Give it back.You know, that thing that is bottled up inside you Just give it back Just give it back. It wants to fly away.All you have to do is just relax and give it back. If you don 't, we can 't take it back. You are the ones that hold it in.

[Research Data, July 2007]24 anthropology of consciousness 23.1Later, he asked people to focus their awareness on their hearts. Part of this approach is the focus on the heart, the physical organ, which is perceived asdoing much more than \"pumping blood. \"What is also important in this model is that the \"patient \"is not passive and relying on the expert to heal them but takes an active role and full responsibility for their healing andfuture well-being, something encouraged by most ayahuasqueros I workedwith. Participants emphasized that one has to \"work \"on their healing; people predominantly used the word \"work \"for what they do during a ceremony. Although many of the interviewees reported health benefits or improvementwith a health issue they were having, no dramatic or miraculous cases werereported. On the contrary, they all recognized that there was still a lot ofwork that needed to be done, and even when they felt they were on a goodtrack they recognized that it was a long process and that they needed to con-tinue pursuing this further. & conclusion I showed that in the context of shamanic tourism, healing is perceived in very specific ways. Things that cause imbalance, usually stemming from neg-ative feelings in the body, need to be expelled or extracted to achieve equilib-rium. Often, a crisis has to occur before a successful healing and negativeexperiences become a catalyst for healing and positive transformation. Inaddition, a big part of the responsibility for healing lies with the patient, andhealing is seen as a process rather than a singular event. Although I haveshown elsewhere (Fotiou 2010) that shamanic tourism can be highly prob-lematic, it is important to look at this phenomenon within a discourse thatsees plant hallucinogens as sacraments and seeks their use in a ritual contextwith healing intentions. While my research has primarily focused on thecultural construction of healing in this particular context, future researchcould focus on the healing effects of ayahuasca using more quantitativemethodology. & acknowledgments The research in this article is based on 17 months of noncontinuous field- work in the area of Iquitos, Peru, which was made possible through a schol-arship by the Greek State Scholarship Foundation (IKY).
