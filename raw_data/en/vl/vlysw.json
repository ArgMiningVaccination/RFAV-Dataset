For example, in many nations (and here in Australia too) parents with unvaccinated children get taxed higher and have continuous reductions in their family benefit and/or family unemployment benefit IF they continue to refuse to vaccinate. Here in Australia, this notorious law has been nicknamed the \"No jab, No Pay\" policy. Most other Western nations are implementing something similar and many non-Western nations already have mandatory vaccines by law (meaning you either get vaccinated or go to jail).

How this can affect your payments? Your child must meet immunisation requirements to get: Child Care Subsidy and Additional Child Care Subsidy the full rate of FTB Part A. Child Care Subsidy If you get this and your child stops meeting these requirements, you have 63 days to start meeting them again. If you don't, your subsidy will stop. message 14: by [Ian](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14438422-ian-miller)(new) [Your point, James.

And each one holds its own potential for harm. DESPITE EXPERTS' REPEATED warnings that rushing a vaccine for Covid-19 could endanger hundreds of millions of people, President Donald Trump has made it clear that he wants to fast track a vaccine. His plan, reportedly, is to bypass regulatory standards in order to have a vaccine ready before Election Day. Such a move could bolster Trump's claims that he's saving us from the coronavirus, rather than worsening the course of the pandemic and causing tens of thousands of avoidable deaths \u2014 and presumably would help him win a second term. But what will happen to the companies that make and market the vaccine if people discover they've been harmed by a product that was hastily brought to market? According to a law passed this spring, pretty much nothing. An amendment to the PREP Act, which was updated in April, stipulates that companies \"cannot be sued for money damages in court\" over injuries caused by medical countermeasures for Covid-19. Such countermeasures include vaccines, therapeutics, and respiratory devices. The only exception to this immunity is if death or serious physical injury is caused by \"willful misconduct.\" And even then, the people who are harmed will have to meet heightened standards for \"willful misconduct\" that are favorable to defendants.

It is very common for (at least) 1 in 50,000 vaccine trialists to fall ill after being vaccinated and often it is not an illness associated with the vaccine. Even so, I remain nervous... message 45: by [Ian](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14438422-ian-miller)(new) [Lance, I would not be nervous until faced with the vaccine. Then, as things stand, yes I would be nervous too, but hopefully more information will turn up. If not, I walk and hope to avoid the virus.](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14438422-ian-miller) message 46: by [Anni](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17465866-anni)(new) - wrote: person in 50000 having an unexpected response is skullduggery on a grand scale?

And the vaccine makers don't have to worry about their 'own self-preservation'. They have that nicely covered with immunity from being sued for damage caused by their vaccines. message 47: by [James](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7840184-james-morcan), Group Founder (new) - [rated unexpected response is skullduggery on a grand scale?

Let's wai...\"](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14438422-ian-miller) The self-preservation I was referring to is from the virus, not the lawyer. I know this is hard for some here to agree to, but the virus is deadly to the aged, and who is not planning to get old? You are entitled to your opinion that the virus will not hurt you, but others are equally entitled to view the statistics, and either the virus is eliminated or vaccines are available, or everyone will get it sooner or later, and like other cornaviruses, probably more than once. Vaccine makers can think ahead, as opposed to some others who cannot see beyond their personal wants today. Self-preservation is to give yourself an out as you age. message 49: by [Scott](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/732181-scott)(new) message 50: by [Lance](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7845695-lance-morcan), Group Founder (last edited 10.

A system which has stood us in good stead down through the ages and which until the 20th Century enabled us to survive without the aid of prescription drugs. Which is why I for one won't be queuing for the miracle vaccine we are assured is coming our way soon. (Before the presidential election if someone has His way).
