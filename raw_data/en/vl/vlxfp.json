We believe caring for the whole person-and realizing whole health-is best achieved by providing for the physical, mental, spiritual, and social needs of every patient we see. Our holistic approach to medicine means treating each individual with the type of care they need when they need it, including the invaluable support of palliative, spiritual, and chronic care. Caring for the mind, the body, and the spirit is an integration of faith and wellness that helps us keep you happy, healthy, and whole. Chronic Care For those living with chronic disease, support services are an important link between the physician's office, the hospital, and the home. Many Dignity Health hospitals offer disease management programs, and all provide disease-specific education for discharged patients as a standard of quality care. Chronic disease self-management programs ultimately result in reduced health care expenditures, improved health outcomes, fewer unnecessary hospital visits and greater quality of life. Palliative Care Palliative care improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing chronic and life-threatening illness by preventing and relieving suffering. It features early identification, assessment and treatment of pain and other physical, psychosocial and spiritual symptoms. As caregivers and health providers, it is our job to care even when we cannot cure. End-of-life palliative care is comprehensive and interdisciplinary, focusing on quality of life for patients and for families, assuring physical comfort and psychosocial support. It is fundamental to our mission to make the final moments of life as meaningful as possible for both patient and family. Spiritual Care As health care providers, we fully embrace the spiritual dimension of life as a key ingredient of our health and well-being and are dedicated to providing spiritual care services to our patients, families and care givers. Spirituality can be a valuable resource in times of crisis, helping us adjust to life transitions and cope with illness, trauma and loss. At Dignity Health, professional chaplains are available to help individuals and families draw upon their religious traditions, faith, or sense of life purpose in facing crisis situations. Our chaplains bring comfort and compassion and promote healing as they accompany individuals and families in their journey through illness, and, at times, through death. And through education and training, our Clinical Pastoral Education program further advances the delivery of excellent spiritual care. "}
