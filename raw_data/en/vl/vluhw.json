It improves the heart's pumping ability, improves blood circulation, increases tolerance to exercise and improves the heart's muscle tone.* As a powerful antioxidant it helps protect heart tissue from free-radical damage.* CoQ10 levels decline after the age of 35. Acetyl-L-Carnitine is a derivative of the amino acid, carnitine. It supports heart function by transporting fatty acids from the blood through to the mitochondrial membranes and into heart cells so the fatty acids can be converted into ATP.* The heart requires a constant supply of ATP in order to provide enough energy for it to keep beating regularly. Malic Acid is involved in energy production in muscle cells. It also supports increased ATP production because it's involved in the Krebs cycle. Malic acid is also needed for glucose metabolism, which is important for nourishing muscles and nerves. Rhodiola is an herb (Rhodiola rosea) that supports cellular energy metabolism.* It promotes higher levels of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and CP (creatine phosphate), thus providing more of the energy molecules needed to perform many daily activities.* We use the Rhodiola rosea species and it's standardized to contain the proven 3:1 ratio of 3 percent rosavins and 1 percent salindosides. Bromelain is a proteolytic enzyme that supports muscle recovery.* It has been shown to alleviate muscle soreness after intense muscle contractions.* Protease is a proteolytic enzyme that decreases muscle "}
