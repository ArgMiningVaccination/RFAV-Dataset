We're breaking down what these terms mean + the best clean, zero waste skincare brands.", "sitename": "Conscious Life & Style", "date": "2023-04-27", "cleaned_text": "So, you're ready to make the transition to more natural, organic, non-toxic, and low or zero waste skincare? Awesome! But first, let's clear up some confusion \u2014 what do these terms even mean? Madeleine of [The Wise Consumer](https://thewiseconsumer.com/) is breaking it all down for us in this guide... We probably know generally what an individual or brand is implying when they're using terms such as \"natural\", \"clean\", and \"non-toxic.\" Most likely they're referring to the fact that [no harmful ingredients](https://consciouslifeandstyle.com/toxic-skincare-ingredients-to-avoid/) are being used, i.e., products that don't contain ingredients that at some point or another were researched and linked to potential increased cases of cancer, endocrine disruption, etc. But what do these words actually mean in the context of skincare? Let's explore. What is \"Natural Skincare\"? While the term natural (i.e., as close to nature as possible) is one of the most commonly used terms in the clean beauty industry, it's honestly just a nice fluffy word that doesn't really hold any legal meaning. Like, none at all. Legally speaking, when it comes to cosmetic labeling, the \" [FDA has not defined the term \"natural](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/resources-industry-cosmetics/small-businesses-homemade-cosmetics-fact-sheet#7)\" nor has it [established a regulatory definition of this term](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/resources-industry-cosmetics/small-businesses-homemade-cosmetics-fact-sheet#7). Think of natural more as a marketing term. That being said, we probably know what a brand is trying to communicate when they're using the term \"natural.\" But just because a brand labels their products as \"natural\" doesn't mean they're always safe. More on this later. What is \"Organic Skincare\"? Similarly, the FDA does not have a legal definition for the term \"organic\" but that doesn't mean the term itself isn't regulated. [As reported by the FDA:](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-labeling-claims/organic-cosmetics) \"The FDA regulates cosmetics under the authority of the [Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act](https://www.fda.gov/federal-food-drug-and-cosmetic-act-fdc-act) (FD&C Act) and the [Fair Packaging and Labeling Act](http://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20161022071126/http:/www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/ucm148722.htm) (FPLA). The term \"organic\" is not defined in either of these laws or the regulations that the FDA enforces under their authority. The Agricultural Marketing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) oversees the [National Organic Program](http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop/indexIE.htm) (NOP).\" It further continues, \"Cosmetic products labeled with organic claims must comply with both USDA regulations for the organic claim and FDA regulations for labeling and safety requirements for cosmetics.\" According to the USDA, [a product is certified organic if and only when it's made up of 95 percent or more organic content](https://www.ams.usda.gov/grades-standards/organic-labeling-standards). You can read more about organic labeling [here](https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/What%20is%20Organic.pdf) and [here](https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/OrganicCosmeticsFactSheet.pdf). So, even though the FDA doesn't regulate the term \"organic,\" cosmetic products labeled \"organic\" are expected to comply with both USDA regulations and FDA regulations when it comes to labeling and safety requirements for cosmetics. You can get more information about labeling from the [FDA's Labeling Guide](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-labeling-regulations/cosmetics-labeling-guide). Do the Labels \"Organic\" and \"Natural\" Mean a Product is Safe? Not necessarily. There are certain plants that are organic and natural but also pretty toxic. I don't care how \"organic\" and \"natural\" a brand claims to be \u2014 if poison ivy is the spotlight ingredient you can bet I'll be looking elsewhere. Natural and organic doesn't always mean safe. [As the FDA shares](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/resources-industry-cosmetics/small-businesses-homemade-cosmetics-fact-sheet#7), \"Newcomers to cosmetic manufacture sometimes think that because they have used a product themselves with no apparent problems, or because the ingredients are 'natural,' 'organic,' or 'botanical,' the product must be safe. This assumption is not correct.\" This is why it's always great to purchase from brands that have been certified/verified by third-party organizations such as [Made Safe](https://www.madesafe.org/). What is Skincare? The Federal Trade Commission's [Green Guides](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_events/975753/ftc_-_environmental_claims_summary_of_the_green_guides.pdf) states \"marketers who claim that their product is non-toxic need competent and reliable scientific evidence that the product is safe for both people and the environment.\" Is toxic defined? Yes. The [Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA)](https://www.cpsc.gov/Business--Manufacturing/Business-Education/Business-Guidance/FHSA-Requirements) of the [The Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/) defines a product as toxic if it \" [can produce personal injury or illness to humans when it is inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed through the skin](https://www.cpsc.gov/Business--Manufacturing/Business-Education/Business-Guidance/FHSA-Requirements).\" That being said, there's a bit of confusion around the labels non-toxic and toxic. [Force of Nature Clean](https://www.forceofnatureclean.com/natural-cleaner-and-disinfectant/) wrote a pretty good article on this topic [here](https://www.forceofnatureclean.com/non-toxic-vs-toxin-free-what-do-these-terms-even-mean/). The last thing I want to clear up is the myth about preservatives. Are All Preservatives in Skincare Bad? The short answer is no. In fact, some products absolutely need preservatives. Without preservatives, certain products could actually become more hazardous than without them. Preservatives help to fight off bacteria and fungi, help keep products shelf-stable for longer periods of time, and more. IMPORTANT NOTE: If a product contains water, it absolutely needs a preservative of some sort, whether synthetic or natural. Why? Because water is a great breeding ground for mold and bacteria. [The risk of using preservatives in your products is far less than the risk of not using them.](https://www.schoolofnaturalskincare.com/do-you-need-to-use-preservatives-homemade-natural-skincare-products/) Equally important, not all products need preservatives. Oil-based products (Anhydrous products), such as serums, don't need preservatives. Oil is a pretty inhospitable place for bacteria to grow.

FDA simplifies it nicely [here](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/potential-contaminants-cosmetics/microbiological-safety-and-cosmetics#Microorganisms). - Want to learn about the difference and effectiveness between synthetic vs \"natural\" preservatives? [Click here](http://microchemlab.com/information/natural-vs-synthetic-preservatives). Honestly, when it comes to terminology and understanding ingredient safety, it can get pretty confusing.
