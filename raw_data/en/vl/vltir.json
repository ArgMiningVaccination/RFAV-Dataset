The global pandemic has already caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives and disrupted the lives of billions more. As well as reducing the tragic loss of life and helping to get the pandemic under control, introduction of a vaccine will prevent the loss of US$ 375 billion to the global economy every month. Global equitable access to a vaccine, particularly protecting health care workers and those most-at-risk is the only way to mitigate the public health and economic impact of the pandemic. Gavi is coordinating the development and implementation of the COVAX Facility, the global procurement mechanism of COVAX. The COVAX Facility will make investments across a broad portfolio of promising vaccine candidates (including those being supported by CEPI) to make sure at-risk investment in manufacturing happens now. This means the COVAX Facility, by pooling purchasing power from all countries that participate, will have rapid access to doses of safe and effective vaccines as soon as they receive regulatory approval. Guided by an allocation framework being developed by WHO, the COVAX Facility will then equitably distribute these doses to help protect the most at-risk groups in all participating countries. Gavi is coordinating the development and implementation of the COVAX AMC, the financing instrument that will support the participation of [92 lower-middle and low-income economies](/news/media-room/92-low-middle-income-economies-eligible-access-covid-19-vaccines-gavi-covax-amc) in the COVAX Facility.

The COVAX AMC and associated support to the eligible countries that apply will build on Gavi's two decades of experience delivering life-saving vaccines to more than half of the world's population, including in the hardest to reach communities. - Country readiness & delivery Gavi is working with Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO to ensure that the infrastructure is in place, and the technical support available, to make sure COVID-19 vaccines can be safely delivered to all those who need them.
