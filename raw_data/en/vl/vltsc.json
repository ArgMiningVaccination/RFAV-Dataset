For all new patients, we are offering Telehealth services for the initial appointment. Telehealth services will continue to be available for established patients. Bay Area Naturopathic Medicine is a primary care clinic dedicated to providing holistic health care. Our integrative medical clinic utilizes Naturopathic and Chinese medicine to provide patients with the most effective personalized care that may utilize one or more of our services. As naturopathic doctors, we diagnose medical conditions similar to those by medical doctors, but we choose a more holistic, integrative treatment approach. We counsel patients in natural treatment therapies, such as diet, herbal medicine, and homeopathy, as well as lifestyle recommendations to enhance the body's natural ability to combat disease. We blend both Western medical sciences with traditional natural medicine approaches--focusing on functional medicine. We can interpret blood work, analyze diagnostic imaging studies, perform gynecological examinations, administer nutrient injections, provide IV therapy, and prescribe pharmaceutical prescriptions with limitations in the state of California. Our goal is to empower patients through education in order to make informed decisions regarding goals to achieve optimal health and wellness. We look forward to preserving a lifetime of good health! I visited Dr. Chan's office with the hope that the natural treatment can be as effective as the other conventional treatments available at my GYN's office, but less invasive and easier to heal. Dr. Chan was very professional and supportive to her me. She not only provided excellent treatment therapy so that I could get a normal pap result, but also gave me suggestions on building a stronger immune system. Dr. Chan was prompt to answer my questions and address concerns. Many thanks to Dr. Chan for what she has done!... After talking with a few naturopathic doctors in the area, I chose Dr. Chan for the treatment of high-grade cervical dysplasia primarily due to her academic background and experience. I was a bit nervous at first when I started the treatment. However, every time I met her during the course of my treatment, I was more and more convinced that I made the correct choice. Not only am I HPV/dysplasia free, I also have tools to be healthy overall. Her focus was not only to clear the HPV/dysplasia, but also to help me adopt healthier lifestyle changes. She is incredibly thorough, patient, caring, and supportive. I am now healthier than I've ever been in my life! Thank you, Dr. Chan.... After I tested positive for HPV, my doctors informed me that there was nothing they could do and that we would just simply need to wait and watch to see what happens. They told me that HPV was very common and that most cases go away in two years. Eventually, I decided to seek a natural method to rid my body of HPV after I developed CIN 1. When I visited Dr. Chan, she put me on a vitamin and suppository regimen. She also helped me understand what foods I should avoid and what foods I should eat more of. I followed her advice for a whole year. I also had 10 escharotic treatments with her. In December of 2011 my gynecologist informed me after a routine pap that I had tested negative for HPV. I am very grateful for Dr. Chan's help. She is extremely knowledgeable about what must be done in order to get rid of HPV. Dr. Chan helped me to understand the importance of my overall health in ridding my body of HPV. Because of her, I changed my lifestyle, which I believe is one of the critical reasons for my healing. I will always be grateful to Dr. Chan for the excellent care that she gave me. She was a great source of wisdom and support throughout my ordeal. The expert regimen that she put me on was what made me well again. The likelihood of my HPV going away on its own seemed like a remote possibility, but thanks to Dr. Chan this has become a reality. Thank you, Dr. Chan!... I am extremely thankful to Dr. Tracy Chan for her superb naturopathic treatments and invaluable advice on how to improve my condition and overall health. More than that, she is, to me, a beacon of light at the end of a dark tunnel as I was facing a dead end due to the lack of alternative treatment options in Asia. This was my first experience with naturopathic medicine. I had to fly halfway across the world to undergo treatment with a doctor whom I have never met but patiently answered my questions beforehand and laid my doubts to rest. Thus, I had full confidence to make the trip over solely for the purpose of a three-week course of treatment with her. Dr. Chan is very knowledgeable and truly cares about her patients. She listened and tailored a treatment protocol very well suited to my individual circumstances and this cured my condition in just a few short months. I am eternally grateful to Dr. Chan for giving me a new lease on life with more energy and a healthier body than before.... I was over the moon and in complete and utter disbelief that after battling this for two years my HPV test is finally negative. I feel like I have finally turned a corner and it is ALL THANKS TO YOU. Two weeks ago, I went for my Pap, praying for the best, and guess what? I finally have a clean Pap after being tormented for a year!! I am so so so happy with my results - a normal pap and HPV negative. Thank you!! Thank you so much for the treatment and advice! I guess not many words could express my gratitude, but I'm really thankful that I made my trip down to the United States and to your clinic. This is definitely the best Christmas gift I've ever received and a super great start for 2014 :)))) The wonderful results have given me a lot of hope, and I certainly wish to stay like this for as long as I can.... 2100 Curtner Ave., Suite G San Jose, CA 95124 10:00 am - 6:00 pm 10:00 am - 6:00 pm 10:00 am - 6:00 pm 10:00 am - 6:00 pm 10:00 am - 6:00 pm Closed Closed "}
