Discover more about this fascinating plant here. Immortella Immortelle oder EXPERIENCES WITH OSHADHI OILS I love these products. The oils are so pure smelling and wonderful. I've benefited immediately! Relaxing, soothing, refreshing. This store is a great resource and awesome service. Thank you so much! [ Airome Inhaler Set ](/products/airome-inhaler-stick-2#judgeme_product_reviews) Greetings, this was a first time purchase of Sage, Clary and I am pleasantly surprised. I use it primarily on the belly (solar plexus) and the crown of the head. The scent is wonderful and calming. I appreciate the overall affect it has on the mind for clarity of thought. I suggested a friend to pick up Sage for this very purpose. I can tell this is of good quality essential oil, as it feels very clean on application. Thank you! [ Sage, Clary (organic) ](/products/sage-clary-organic#judgeme_product_reviews) We love this scent SOOO much. Thank you for making it While this is now marketed as a fragrance for men, I, as a woman who loves earthy scents, have loved it for a while now. I first got a sample about 20 years ago from a housemate who worked in the industry. I used that up, bought it again years later and then ran out. I was thrilled to see US distribution again and that the original recipe has not changed. It's an amazing lasting fragrance for man or woman. I would get compliments all the time and look forward to enjoying it for more years to come. [ Santalia Eau de Toilette for Men ](/products/santalia-for-man-eau-de-toilette#judgeme_product_reviews) This is a powerful, potent oil, but gentle at the same time. We used it all the time when we were traveling and did not get sick, though many other people got Covid. We wore masks and put a drop of Ravintsara in them to help us breathe and to prevent illness. We were very happy and impressed. We use this oil all the time because it has such good effects. [ Ravintsara (organic) ](/products/ravintsara-organic#judgeme_product_reviews) I was having some problems with my lungs and I reached for this oil. Not only did it open my lungs (I have asthma) but it had an unexpected calming effect on my whole physiology. It really was surprising and wonderful! [ Eucalyptus Radiata (organic) ](/products/eucalyptus-radiata-organic#judgeme_product_reviews) Smells heavenly - thought I was buying more than I got....it's a teeny amount; micro amount! [ Rose Blossom, White ](/products/rose-blossom-white-bulgaria#judgeme_product_reviews) I just want to thank Adrienne for patiently waiting for my check to cover aromatic Hridaya. It makes me relax and be happy with one whiff. [ Hridaya ](/products/hridaya#judgeme_product_reviews) Love the scent, and it brings me back to when I was a child and would have a season with allergies. Now it works to help me with this and other respiratory conditions. [ Eucalyptus Radiata (organic) ](/products/eucalyptus-radiata-organic#judgeme_product_reviews) Love Lavandin! It's a fresh scent, I am using it after before and after my exercise. I do exercise at HOTWORX, where you workout in a small sauna with infrared light ant temperature goes from 97 to 130 F. It is a way to have a fresh scent for me and for the next person coming. I am Brazilian-American and I follow Yan Oberleander, Oshadhi Brazil, and he explained that Lavandin is Lavandula Angustifolia and Lavandula Latifolia. It has camphor in its composition and helps with breathing, and because there's less linalool and linalil acetate it does not have the sleeping relaxing effect. [ Lavandin Abrial (organic) ](/products/lavandin-abrial-organic#judgeme_product_reviews) I love the aluminum inhaler with the eucalyptus radiata it opens up my sinuses and tucks easily into my purse or bag. [ Airome Inhaler Stick ](/products/airome-inhaler-stick#judgeme_product_reviews) Years ago I would buy this at Wild Oats Market, I loved it then and now happily I have found it again online. Roots is a perfect name for this fragrance, like walking in the woods, or near cedar trees. The Peppery hint is nice too, a warming scent perfect to wear in the colder months. Love this Hydrolate. Fresh, floral. I had a stiye and I used in my eyes to help disinfect, cicatrization and also help me with seasonal allergies here in Texas. I also put some in my lemonade and it tasted delicious. Need to get more. [ Lavender, Highland Hydrolate (organic) ](/products/lavender-highland-hydrolate-organic#judgeme_product_reviews) Thanks I really enjoyed the visit there! I love this product! What a marvelous scent! I am using as a body spray. I live in Texas and because the heat is terrible, I spray on me when I feel it's too hot. It's refreshing (I keep in the refrigerator), hydrates my skin plus smells wonderful. Had to order more!
