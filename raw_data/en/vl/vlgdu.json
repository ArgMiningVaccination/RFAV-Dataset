Dr. Kashdan is unique in that she has degrees in both naturopathic medicine and Chinese medicine/acupuncture. This combination of western and eastern medical training provides her patients with a truly integrative approach to healthcare. Her naturopathic practice focuses on using nutrition, lifestyle, nutraceuticals, botanical medicine, and homeopathy as tools to help her patients achieve health. Her acupuncture practice includes acupuncture, non-insertive techniques, bodywork, cupping, herbal formulas and moxibustion. She's also a certified yoga instructor and personal trainer. When she's not at the clinic you can find her competing in powerlifting, practicing yoga, training, and hiking in the Colorado Mountains. Dr. Kashdan specializes in (but is not limited to) the following conditions: As a Naturopathic doctor and licensed acupuncturist I treat the whole person; meaning that I consider all aspects of who you are in my medical approach. I will help guide you back to health using treatments tailored specifically to you. My goal is to support your body's innate resources in harmony with nature; rather than to simply suppress symptoms. I will empower you as we work together to optimize your health and quality of life. \"Having just moved into the area I recently became a new patient with Dr. Sarah Kashdan. I discovered her personal treatments with acupuncture offered a healing modality carefully practiced in an environment that nourishes deep intuition and inspired realization. In this serene environment there can occur an enhanced symmetry between soul, mind and body; and the generation of an enhanced sense of well being. Blood pressure issues can be easily identified and addressed through the lens of good nutrition, diet, and exercise. Her understanding of personal health generously considers the many avenues available to advocates of wholeness and personal enrichment. So glad she's here!\" -D.
