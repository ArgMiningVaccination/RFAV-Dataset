Acupressure is a massage technique more than 3,500 years old based on the theories of traditional Chinese medicine. Instead of needles, as used in acupuncture, the fingers are used to apply pressure, but the hand, elbow, or other elements may also be used. It involves using pressure from the fingers to mobilize energy (QI or \"Chi\"). This pressure is usually applied to specific points, called \"acupressure points,\" which also coincide with the acupuncture points. \"Traditional Chinese medicine bases its therapeutic principles on the concept of vital energy or QI. This energy flows through channels or 'meridians' in the body. For acupressure treatment, physical pressure is applied to these points to eliminate blockages on these meridians\", explains Philippa Harvey, Specialist in Traditional Chinese Medicine at SHA Wellness Clinic. One of the main differences between acupressure and acupuncture is the use of fingers instead of needles. The 8 essential pressure points Within this discipline, eight essential pressure points can be found. By pressing on these areas, we can help relieve pain, restore balance, and improve health throughout the body. Below, Philippa Harvey explains where to find these points and what benefits to achieve. 1. Wrist meridian point 1: happiness It is located past the little finger to the wrist crease. It's the point of happiness. If you press on it regularly, we can help promote happiness by improving our emotions. 2. Point 7 of the heart meridian: anxiety, insomnia, and depression This pressure point can be located in the wrist crease. There is a line there that appears to be more prominent than the others. Once you have identified this crease, draw an imaginary line between your little finger and your thumb. Apply gentle pressure to this point to combat anxiety, insomnia, heart palpitations, and depression. 3. Small bowel meridian point 3: neck, ear, and migraines It's on the outside of the hand, right on the edge. The exact spot is the depression in the hand just below the little finger. Pressing on this point relieves neck, ear, and head pain. 4. Lung meridian: colds, runny nose, and sore throat The pressure points of the pulmonary meridian extend along the edge of the hand, from the tip of the thumb down and along the edge of the hand. You don't have to go beyond the wrist. Gently massage the most sensitive points to relieve any symptoms of cold, sneezing, runny nose, and sore throat. 5. Inner door point: digestion, nausea, and stomach The point known as the internal door can be found in the fold of the wrist. Extend your hands and go about two fingers beyond the wrist to find a sensitive point. Press firmly with your thumb to improve digestion, relieve nausea, and soothe stomach pain. 6. Outer door point: immune system and revitalization The so-called external gate point is more an area that can be found between the two tendons in the back of the arm. Press firmly on this part to stimulate the immune system quickly or revitalize you if you feel tired. 7. The base of thumb tip: breathing difficulties This point is located on the wrist. The application of a gentle massage to this location helps to alleviate respiratory problems. 8. Hand Valley Point: Stress and Tension This point can be found between the thumb and the index finger. It helps to reduce stress, relieve migraines, relieve toothache, decrease shoulder tension, and relieve neck pain.
