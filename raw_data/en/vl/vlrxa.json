University of California - Interim Policy SARS- CoV-2 Vaccination Program 2 of 10 I. POLICY SUMMARY The purpose of this policy is to protect the health and safety of the University community, including its patients and the faculty, staff, trainees , and others who work or train in any of the University's locations . The policy requires all University of California personnel and certain trainees working or learning on- site to participate in education about the SARS -CoV-2 vaccines that will be availabl e and either consent to administration of the vaccine or affirmatively opt out of SARS CoV -2 vaccination. II. DEFINITIONS Approval: For purposes of this policy, a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine is considered \"approved\" after the following conditions are met: (i) the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued an Emergency Use Authorization or License ; (ii) the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended its administration; and (ii i) the relevant clinical location (e.g., Academic Medical Center, Student Health Service) has authorized the vaccine for distribution to personnel and/or trainees, as applicable. Healthcare Location : A collection of buildings and personnel that service a n academic health system or student health service, including hospital s, ambulatory surgery center s, outpatient center s, clinic s, or other locations where preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, or other interventional physical or behavioral healthcare services are provided to UC Health patients , employees, or research participants and any associated educational, research, or administrative facilities and offices . A healthcare location refers only to that part of a campus that meets this definition. Initial Alloc ation: The period immediately following Emergency Use Authorization or Licensing of SARS -CoV-2 vaccine, and extending until the time when there are sufficient supplies to vaccinate all personnel and trainees who wish to be vaccinated. Location: Any California facility operated by the University in connection with its research, teaching, public service, or clinical care missions or programs. A location does not include a property owned by the University but leased to a third party unless (and only to the extent) a University -operated program or activity occurs at that location. Location Vaccine Authority: The office or person responsible for implementing the SARS- CoV-2 Vaccination Program for a location , typically the Chief Medical Officer at a Medical Center or an Occupational Health or Student Health office at an academic campus . Participation: Receipt of education about SARS -CoV-2 vaccine and either: (i) receipt of an approved SARS -CoV-2 vaccine at a location, (ii) obtaining vaccination at an alternative site (e.g., a primary care physician's office, a public health clinic, a local pharmacy, or a vaccine fair ), or (iii) submission of a signed vaccination declination statement. Participation compliance under this poli cy for those receiving vaccine may require recurrent vaccinations or boosters on an annual or recurring basis consistent with FDA labeling and CDC recommendations . University of California - Interim Policy SARS- CoV-2 Vaccination Program 3 of 10 Personnel: University faculty, other academic personnel , and staff working or learning on site, including but not limited to visiting , volunteer, without salary, and emeritus/a professors, visiting or volunteer academic personnel, and contract , recall , and emeritus/a employees.

D. Registry and Program Evaluation 1. Appropriate information about all vaccinations shall be submitted to the California Immunization Registry (CAIR) or such other registries as may be required by applicable public health agencies or University policy. 2. Individual healthcare locations shall , and other locations may, evaluate initial allocation and, thereafter, program participation , on an annual and ongoing basis, including evaluation of equity and disparities in initial allocation and program implementation; as well as reasons identified for non-participation or untimely participation, the number and characteristics of personnel and trainees not vaccinated, and the reasons given (if any) for declination. E. Prog ram Enforcement 1. Program participation is mandatory, but each participant may, after receiving appropriate information about the vaccine, consent to vaccination or decline. Declination may require additional compensating safety measures , as determined by the l ocation vaccine authority and consistent with applicable public health directives . University of California - Interim Policy SARS- CoV-2 Vaccination Program 7 of 10 2. Any personnel or trainee subject to this policy who fails to participate in the SARS -CoV-2 Vaccination Program as described in section E.1 above by the locally established deadline may be removed from the work or training schedule starting on the next calendar day without pay, consistent with applicable policies and collective bargaining agreement s. IV. COMPLIANCE / RESPONS IBILITIES A.

If, at the end of that process , a final policy has not been approved, this Interim Policy will automatically be rescinded. B. CDC and FDA generally tr anslate VIS into many languages commonly spoken in California and elsewhere in the United States and post these online. The relevant VIS should be provided to a person receiving vaccine in a language that they understand. In the event relevant VIS translat ions are unavailable, they should be accompanied when distributed with a document with taglines such as those approved by the U.S. Department of H ealth & Human Services to facilitate language access by all affected personnel and trainees . Interpreters should also be made available in person, by video, or by phone during vaccine clinics. C. Each location is responsible for: (i) assuring any necessary updates are made to their local Infectious Diseases/Infection Prevention and Control Programs; ( ii) establishing deadlines for SARS -CoV-2 Vaccination Program participation on an annual or ongoing basis, in consultation with epidemiology and infection prevention experts and occupational health representatives as applicable and consistent with any supply limitations ; and ( iii) assuring implementation of the SARS- CoV-2 Vaccination Program at all sites . 1. Prior to the delivery of the first vaccine supplies, eac h location , in consultation with the l ocation vaccine authority and others , as appropriate, shall develop and publicly post its plans for initial allocation of vaccine and any subsequent periods of shortage, consistent with guidelines and directives published by federal , state , and local authorities, including the ethical principles articulated by the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices: (1) maximize benefits and minimize harms; (2) promote justice; (3) mitigate health inequities; and ( 4) promote transparency. University of California - Interim Policy SARS- CoV-2 Vaccination Program 8 of 10 2. Implementation includes informing personnel and trainees of the requirement and deadline for program participation, dates and locations for on- site administration, and that vaccines will be provided at no cost. 3. Each location should implement strategies for vaccine access, including efforts to ensure vaccination availability during all work shifts and to address vaccine hesitancy, particularly among groups at most significant risk for contracting COVID -19 and suffering severe i llness . 4. Timing for implementation will depend on timing of vaccine approval, recommendations of federal and state public health authorities, and the availability of vaccine from suppliers. In the event of supply shortages, a location may choose to delay m andating program participation. D. Deans, Department Chairs, unit heads , managers , and supervisors are responsible for supporting program implementation and enforcement . Consultation with Academic Senate leaders, especially on the campus, is encouraged with respect to academic personnel. V. PROCEDURES A. Each location may establish local procedures to facilitate implementation of this policy. VI.

The University of California recommends that individuals working at healthcare locations, except those who have had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of the COVID -19 vaccine or to any of its components,* receive a vaccination to protect against COVID -19 disease. I acknowledge that I am aware of the following facts: COVID -19 is a serious disease, and has killed over 250,000 people in the United States since February 2020, near ly 20,000 in California alone. Influenza vaccine is recommended for me other healthcare workers to protect our patients, students, faculty, and staff from COVID -19, its complications, and death. If I contract COVID -19, I can shed the virus for several day s even before any symptoms appear. During the time I shed the virus, I can transmit it to patients, students, faculty, and staff. If I become infected with SARS -CoV -2, even if my symptoms are mild or non- existent, I can spread the disease to others.
