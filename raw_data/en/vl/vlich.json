After the series of holograms has been captured by the hardware, high-resolution images of each plane in the sample are created by computer processing. Improved image resolution is achieved by employing a synthetic aperture and multiple-viewpoint-holographic methods. STEVE's intuitive interface controls the microscope, explores live cell data using interactive digital staining and even performs quantitative analysis on cell measurements. STEVE runs smoothly, even during acquisition. Watch the video to learn more about STEVE. Applications Nanolive's top applications for the 3D Cell Explorer Neuron on carpet of astrocytes. High resolution imaging of mitosis in stem cells. Antibodies being used as a T cell targeting system to wipe out cancer cells. The combination of holography and rotational scanning makes Nanolive imaging a revolutionary technology Nanolive's technology is unique because it works label-free and reports the 3D refractive index distribution of the cell. The extremely low light power that generates the holograms allows for a total absence of phototoxicity which leads to excellent time resolution.
