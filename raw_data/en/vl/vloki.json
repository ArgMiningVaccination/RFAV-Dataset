Learn about why you may be experiencing back pain below, and discover whether the DRS Protocol is the right treatment to help you finally experience true relief from your lower back pain. From my first [DRS treatment], I could feel the lumbar nerve impingement decrease and the numbness in my toes diminish. After my second [DRS treatment], I could walk upright at a fast pace without pain. I have a ways to go in my treatment, but the initial relief has far exceeded my expectations. Thank you Dr. Auth and Staff.

Understanding the origin of your lower back pain Your intervertebral discs separate each of the vertebrae in your spine and function as soft and flexible shock absorbers. These discs have a rigid outer case but are soft and gel-like inside. There are several ways your lower back's discs can become compromised and cause you pain. Since your discs don't have a dedicated blood supply, they rely on diffusion to receive water, oxygen and nutrients. This diffusion occurs when your spine is properly aligned and functioning correctly. When your spine is not properly functioning, and the flow of water, oxygen, and nutrients is disrupted, your discs can degenerate, herniate or bulge. This can irritate your nerve roots, which may be extremely painful. Your discs can also degenerate from lack of proper mobility. Repetitive activity and stress on your spine can cause disc material to protrude abnormally\u2014causing what is known as a disc bulge or a disc herniation. Severe pain may result if this material bulges enough to press against a nerve root. Discover how the DRS Protocol can help you achieve relief from your low back pain.
