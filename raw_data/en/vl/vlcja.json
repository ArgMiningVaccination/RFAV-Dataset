Law Stuart Rabinowitz President & CEO President Long Island Association Hofstra UniversityOctober 2, 2017 Dear Commissioner Zemsky: The Long Island Regional Economic Development Council is proud to present A Region in Motion , the evolving vision of our strategic plan for economic growth. Our continued emphasis on innovation and inclusion, as well as collaboration and consensus, reflects the dedication of dozens of council and work group volunteers. These members devoted the past year to reviewing our accomplishments over the first six years and recommended new projects that were developed with our stakeholders throughout Long Island to advance our strategies. Beyond our steadfast commitment to our Opportunity Agenda in Wyandanch, which is rising anew before our very eyes, our goal remains the creation of an opportunity economy for all Long Island, regardless of race, ethnicity, community, educational level or industry sector. Included in this document are the Progress Report, Round Seven project recommendations, a deep dive into the economics of the region, especially a comprehensive look at the \"skills gap,\" and a rollout of our second Downtown Revitalization Initiative awardee, the diversifying transit hub of Hicksville. In addition to promoting our biotech industry cluster and emphasizing sustainable practices, especially in our legacy agricultural sector, we believe our priorities continue to meet Governor Andrew Cuomo's catalytic challenge to create transformative change. We are especially proud of how, even in our seventh year, our work groups continued to collaborate and strategize throughout the year to keep our pipeline of projects flowing. Their meetings remain exciting, alive with new ideas and relationships, including stakeholders and aspiring entrepreneurs. A key to our progress has been the cross-pollination between work groups that has broken down walls between people, institutions, companies, communities, and sectors. The Council would like to applaud your leadership and that of Lt. Gov. Kathleen Hochul and Governor Cuomo. The Long Island region was desperately in need of the encouragement to collaborate that came with creation of the regional councils and the competition for funding. In the spirit of the proposed third Long Island Rail Road track, we are a region in motion, headed in the right direction of economic growth and job creation.

This is a region whose agriculture and fishery harvests have fed the nation, whose natural assets have inspired poets and tourists alike, whose businesses produced the aircraft that helped win a world war and first put men on the moon and whose institutions cracked the genetic code. Long Island will reassert itself as a global center for innovation and the model for a knowledge-based suburban economy that creates new high-paying jobs and improves the quality of life for every one of our residents. The Long Island Regional Council' s vision for long-term economic growth is characterized by increased collaboration among academia, the private and public sectors and labor to protect and grow our advanced manufacturing base while encouraging innovation in the life sciences, information technology, clean energy, defense and homeland security industry clusters. To accomplish this, we will build on the successes of our existing businesses, commercialize the valuable research conducted at our world-class research institutions, and strengthen our highly skilled and educated workforce. At the same time, we will be vigilant in promoting and protecting our unrivaled natural resources and in providing equal opportunity in housing, employment and education. Furthermore, we will continue to invest in our students, transportation, housing and sewer infrastructure, as well as our tourism and harvest-based agriculture and fishery industries. Our goal is to support a sustainable, innovative and inter-connected job-generating economy that also redevelops areas suffering from disinvestment and mobilizes the entire region for years to come. i8 Key Strategie S for economic growth Id e n t If y and support industry clusters, especially biotechnology, that possess the potential to bring together researchers, educators, investors, manufacturers and others in a collaborative effort to accelerate the commercialization of technical and scientific discovery and generate jobs at every rung of the employment ladder.

Part One: executIve summaR y/ tHe bIg pIctuRe of pRogRess The economy is the engine that pulls the train,\" declared Governor Andrew Cuomo, during a ceremony to celebrate our second Downtown Revitalization Initiative winner and the approval of a third track for the Long Island Rail Road, which will generate billions in economic activity. He meant his \"engine\" and \"train\" analogies literally. Before an enthusiastic crowd of regional business leaders and elected officials, Governor Cuomo went on to say that Long Island's future relies on overcoming \"NIMBY paralysis\" and nurturing job-creating synergies between the world's largest commuter rail system and dozens of suburban village centers. It's essential, he said, if the region wants to attract well- trained young workers who will grow our collaborative bioscience cluster, as well as legacy industries from aerospace to agriculture. Such consensus and commitment is the key to preserving open space, protecting the environment and beating back blight. It's the key, as affirmed by Governor Cuomo and Long Island Regional Economic Development Council strategies, to \"making Long Island work\" for everyone. Long Island is on the right track. We couldn't have said that with a straight face six years ago when the LIREDC started on its journey, along with the nine other regions of the state. We were hemorrhaging jobs and businesses, and we weren't cooperating to turn things around - not our universities and research centers, not our local governments, not the leaders of various industry sectors. Things have changed for the better. They have changed so much that our challenge has shifted from merely creating as many jobs as possible to finding workers with specialized skills for an increasing number of unfilled positions. But it's a challenge that we're better prepared for than ever. Whether it's the transformative state commitment to the LIRR third track, which will encourage job-creating commutation from NYC, or the prodigious investments in \"placemaking\" and workforce training that are reviving whole communities, or the innovation partnerships between businesses and research institutions to turn discovery into tradeable products, we believe the region is moving forward with increasing momentum. The LIREDC's inclusive process of producing and promoting development strategies, and its relentless pursuit of promising projects and programs to achieve them, has enriched the region with hundreds of new or stronger businesses and thousands of new or retained jobs. We are creating an economy that is working for - that is empowering - all Long Islanders.\" While Nadia Rana was diving deeply into the world of glycobiology at Stony Brook University, she was afforded the freedom to explore other passions and a variety of career opportunities. Rana decided to take Fundamentals of the Biosciences Industry Program, offered through the Center for Biotechnology. It was her first formal exposure to the different segments of the research industry proper. She quickly learned and put into practice principles of competitive analysis, regulatory compliance, feasibility studies, as well as patentability issues, business plans, and resources. Following graduation, Rana joined the lab of Dr. Yusuf Hannun, Director of the Cancer Center at Stony Brook. Here, Rana took on a non- traditional postdoc, carrying out independent research projects, but also laying the groundwork to help establish the University's first Lipidomics Core Facility. \"Through both independent research projects and collaborative projects, I realized that I greatly enjoyed working in a team environment, complementing the skills of others to drive research forward,\" said Rana. \"I also realized that I wanted to focus more heavily on research efforts that would have a direct impact on improving healthcare, and decided to shift my efforts towards translational research with a commercialization focus exclusively.\" It was that focus that led her to her current position as Product Manager of Enzo Life Sciences Inc., Rana is now charged with overseeing the company's Genomics portfolio. \"It is rewarding being involved with the full product life cycle and seeing my contribution throughout the process have a direct impact; from inception of a product/idea, to testing feasibility and guiding R&D ideation, to manufacturing scale up, and eventually to educating our sales team and supporting various facets of outreach to customers,\" continued Rana. \"From start to finish, I'm truly engaged in the entire process.\" And so is Long Island's new innovation economy.Dr. NaDia a. r aNa ProDuctioN MaNager eNzo Life ScieNce 2Introduction And Executive Summary How we'Re doIng... Do we still have a long way to go to realize all our goals? Of course. While Long Island continues to add jobs and attract business at a brisk pace, our rate of growth in these areas is lagging the state average. This may be attributable to our enviable \"full-employment\" status, but clearly we have room to rise in all sectors. Do we continue to require state resources to leverage private investment and improve our ability to grow key sectors? Most definitely. While we are a statewide leader in projects applied for, funded and completed, as well as in overall economic growth, we know that many more businesses and communities could benefit from LIREDC engagement. And while lower than the rest of the state, Long Island's poverty rate remains troublingly and unacceptably high - at 6.6 percent the highest in 60 years. But overall, we remain optimistic and determined. From what we see and hear - from the impressive regional metrics to the increasing number of stakeholders engaged with or supportive of the LIREDC's efforts - Long Island has come far in the past six years to re-establish itself as one of the state's economic engines. And we are still moving forward. Consider the region's last year alone: Long Island's unemployment rate continues to shrink - down to 4.1 percent and falling - to levels unseen since well before the Great Recession. The overall number of jobs stands at a record high. And it's fair to say that thousands of these new or retained positions can be traced to workforce development and other key strategies of the LIREDC, not to mention implementation efforts by regional Empire State Development staff. The aggressive outreach and attention to detail - the recruiting and \"matchmaking\" of potential awardees - has resulted in an extraordinarily high percentage of successfully completed projects worth billions to the local economy. Beyond the DRI, Long Island again added to the roster of villages and hamlets that have overcome years of resistance and opted for transit-oriented, smart growth development in their downtowns. Many of these transformative placemaking efforts, which feature affordable apartments, arts venues and other amenities that contribute to their \"walkability,\" have been energized by LIREDC-recommended investments in public-private partnerships that reflect the \"grass-roots\" wishes of the community. And that trend will continue with funding in Port Jefferson, Huntington, Riverhead and other emerging village hot spots. Long Island's world-class research institutions and businesses continue to collaborate in nurturing an \"innovation ecosystem\" that has encouraged cooperative workforce training initiatives in a range of industries, private investment in our burgeoning biotechnology cluster and the job-creating commercialization of academic discovery. Many of the goods and services produced by these partnerships have furthered the LIREDC's goal of boosting tradeable exports and foreign investment, which are growing faster than the state average. Students in engineering - a field with a shortage of qualified workers - have doubled. Enrollees in non-academic tech training programs have risen sharply as well, showing particular success in reducing unemployment among veterans and others with untapped potential to grow Long Island's economy across the board. Strategic state funding of \"unsexy\" infrastructure, such as sewers, has begun to pay off in the form of development projects, especially affordable apartments, otherwise not possible without the increased waste disposal capacity. These public works come with the added benefit of protecting the environment and building resiliency in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. And that includes \"green infrastructure\" solutions along with brick and mortar. Thus, the LIREDC continues to partner with our counties, towns, villages and NGOs to complete the post-storm recovery and promote economic development as an essential feature of a resilient Island. 3How we'Re doIng... Additional details and data to support all these claims are spread throughout this report, in various charts and work group reports. We believe they tell the story of an REDC that has enthusiastically embraced its responsibility as stewards of state tax dollars and the regional economy - a responsibility, shared with our stakeholders, that our individual members take very seriously. Governor Cuomo's regional economic development model has been especially effective - and welcome - on Long Island. As many elected officials and real estate developers have found, \"top down\" doesn't work here. The bi-county region is comprised of hundreds of communities, many with their own independent governing bodies as well as influential civic and business organizations. They don't like being told what to do and they have enough power to block projects of regional significance, even if it only touches their borders. But when \"outsiders\" take the time to work with local people, when the approach to development is holistic, inclusive and from the \"bottom up,\" progress can be made. The LIREDC has doubled down on its Opportunity Agenda, continuing to invest not only in apartments, shops and other amenities in Wyandanch, but in the people who waited so long so see their community-driven\"visionings\" come to life. T raining programs, established in cooperation with community colleges and building trades unions, have allowed dozens of Wyandanch residents to start not just jobs but new careers at the construction sites. This inclusivity, which we are reaching for as a feature in all infrastructure projects, reflects our deep strategic commitment to creating an \"opportunity economy\" for all. State investments in tourism, agriculture, historic places and the arts, all of which flourish hand-in-hand, are paying off with increases in visitors, spending and tax dollars for local and state government. Between 2014 and 2015, the latest data available, the economic impact of tourism on Long Island rose three percent to $5.5 billion. Industry leaders credit LIREDC- supported initiatives to promote tourism, as well as agriculture and the environment, for a notable share of the increases. And with the focus on foreign visitors, in conjunction with New York City tourism organizations, the industry is creating more jobs and bringing new, export-like stimulus to the regional economy. Since Governor Cuomo identified cost-sharing among local governments as a state priority, the LIREDC has taken on assisting villages, towns and the counties to create partnerships aimed at reducing pressure on property taxes. These \"shared services\" agreements sometimes involve private businesses that have the technology and expertise to reduce costs and deliver services at a savings to beleaguered taxpayers. One example, engineering firm MK McLean Associates is working with the Town of Brookhaven and the Village of Shoreham on an innovative green infrastructure project that would be prohibitive without collaboration and state support. Even after seven years, enthusiasm for the regional council system remains high. Our CFAs jumped 29 percent, our 20 DRI applications accounted for nearly 20 percent of the statewide total, and Council and work group membership is as high as ever, with dozens of well-respected citizens volunteering their time and talent to our various tasks. And more: The regional consensus achieved on the third track and other major projects reflects the LIREDC's catalytic influence on economic issues beyond its specific mandate. Our members have become engaged beyond the council itself, for the good of the greater community. 4How we'Re doIng... That's the LIREDC way. And that's one of the biggest reasons we have been so successful in promoting job-creating projects that have languished for years, in places long written off as resistant to change. \"The Long Island strategic plan had a focus on downtowns from the beginning,\" noted Howard Zemsky, President and CEO of Empire State Development, at the announcement of this year's DRI winner. \"They have always sought to make Long Island more walkable, diverse and affordable.\" In other words, we took the DRI approach before there was an official DRI. Beyond the community level, another reason for our success - and why the REDC model has worked on Long Island - is the focus on regional partnerships among universities, research centers, major businesses and government. The LIREDC has managed to bring together powerful institutions - Stony Brook and Hofstra Universities, the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research and Cold Spring Harbor Labs - that not only never worked together but often worked at cross purposes in unproductive rivalries. That has changed in a big way. Hundreds of jobs a year have sprung from new relationships that have commercialized discovery and trained a new generation of workers - from newly minted PhDs and engineers to unemployed veterans and others struggling up the economic ladder to all levels of the production spectrum. Still another reason for the LIREDC's success is the quality and commitment of the hundreds of volunteers who populate the Council and its work groups. The members reflect the exciting new diversity in America's First Suburb , a mix of people of various racial and professional backgrounds who collectively devote thousands of hours to meeting with the public, finding and vetting projects, and advocating for the region. As noted, but can't be said often enough, the Council and work group members - as well as ESD staff - have marshaled a critical mass of support for major projects. And the broad-based campaign for the Third T rack is not the only example. In short, the LIREDC and the new model it represents has moved the region forward in ways few anticipated when we began this empowering journey seven years ago. We look forward to continuing to follow the comprehensive strategies that have transformed the region and brought us ever closer to our goal - our dream - of an economy that works for every Long Islander. \"At the end of the day our obligation is very simple. We are supposed to leave this place better than we found it,\" said the governor at the Long Island ceremony. \"I believe we will leave a better Long Island than we found it.\" We are on our way, on the right track, to that better Long Island. Round Seven Priority Projects We are especially pleased with the potential impact of our Round Seven Priority Projects , including the creation of new, collaborative capacities to identify and treat cancers, the transformation of a long-blighted coastal village into a transit-oriented tourist gateway, the use of shellfish as both a tradeable commodity and environmental protector, the development of pipelines in underserved communities that move high school students into STEM careers, and the promotion of tourism and arts programs during slower seasons. (Project specifics appear in the work group reports.) We believe these and other Round Seven Projects will advance all key strategies and move Long Island down the track of success. All aboard!5 What the Numbers tell us... Part Two: Proof of Progress State of the Region General Economic Indicators Today, Long Island's economy is strong, with economic output at $193.6 billion in 2016, up 1.6 percent from 2015, and private-sector employment at 1.1 million, an all-time high. Health care remains the region's key industry, generating 9 percent of total output and accounting for 19 percent of its private sector payroll. Global exports from the region grew by $161.8 million between 2012 and 2015. Current (2016) 1-Year Progress State 1-Year Progress Gross Regional Product (2016, in billions) $193.6 1.6% 0.2% Exports (2015, in billions) $ 15.5 -1.1% -1.2% Long Island continues to add jobs and attract businesses at a brisk pace. While growth in jobs and establishments lagged the state, the region added nearly 83,000 private-sector positions between 2011 and 2016, to a record 1.1 million jobs at 104,600 establishments. The fastest job growth was in construction, with a 28 percent increase over the last five years, as a result of new residential and mixed-use development projects as well as critical infrastructure updates. Health care and social assistance accounted for two of every ten private-sector jobs added over that time period. Manufacturing on Long Island continues to shrink, losing 1,900 jobs over the last five years. However, factories across the region are hiring but report they are having difficulty finding qualified applicants.

Slow overall population growth combined with an aging population can limit future economic growth. The region's population grew by only 0.7 percent between 2011 and 2016, less than half the state's 1.8 percent. Over that same time period, Long Islanders over the age of 65 increased by 13.8 percent. However, efforts undertaken by the council to add to the region's affordable multi -unit housing stock may have played a role in keeping or attracting young adults between the ages of 20 and 34. Long Island added 34,178 Millen nials over the last five years. Quality of Life Indicators The high cost of living and an aging population has led to an increase in out -migration. The proportion of Long Islanders who stayed decreased from 97.9% in 2014 to 97.5% in 2015. Meanwhile, 2,673 more Long Islanders left New York State, a 5.8% increase from 2014. However, a stronger economy that created more high -quality jobs resulted in a higher share of Long Islanders working in the region.

The LIREDC has concentrated its grants to support downtown developments near train stations. In the last six years the region has seen a tremendous increase in LIRR ridership. We do not think that is a coincidence. 77798183858789 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016LIRR Ridership (below in millions) Clearly, the nearly $500 million the region has received through the REDC process has made a difference. The chapter that follows includes just a few of the tangible examples-but there are many more as explained throughout this report. 12Status of Past Priority Projects The LIREDC and ESD weren't the only players in Long Island's remarkable rise from the depths of the Great Recession, but there's no doubt we were among the stars of this comeback saga. Without the regional consensus for economic growth, as well as a strategic plan and competition for achieving it, our path to prosperity would have been slower and less steady. More than one influential official or business owner has remarked that if we didn't have an LIREDC - especially during the recovery from Superstorm Sandy - we would have had to invent it. What has made the LIREDC so successful is its inclusiveness, not only in how strategies are devised and projects selected, but in where state-dollars are sent to leverage the private sector. We are especially proud of \"being there\" before the state has told us. We jumped deeply into the \"hurting\" hamlet of Wyandanch, Suffolk's poorest, before there was an Opportunity Agenda. We targeted biotech as our cluster of choice, bringing together academic researchers and investors, before we were required to select an industry cluster. We conducted extensive surveys of businesses and educational institutions to close a skills gap that, once the jobs began to flow, made it harder to fill them. We supported downtown revitalization initiatives, as ESD President Howard Zemsky has noted, before there was a Downtown Redevelopment Initiative. Taking the long-view to development, we recommended substantial investments in \"unsexy\" sewer projects that now are paying off in supporting denser smart-growth, TOD projects and protecting our natural assets with a head start toward cleaning up nitrogen pollution. What we are proudest of is how, from the start, we sought to create an Opportunity Economy by focusing not only on job creation in underserved communities but on the people - veterans, minority youth, disabled and others - often left behind even in the best of times. We were determined not to let that happen, not on our watch. What We've Done .. . Below are examples of six-years of carefully considered investments in people and places that have generated jobs and hope. Wyandanch Rising received REDC funding in Round One (2011) when the Town of Babylon was awarded $6 million to support a $228.7 million project for the creation of two roadways for access to the new Intermodal Plaza, and construction of the Plaza. Wyandanch Rising is a public-private partnership to transform the economically distressed community into an active mixed-use, mixed income, transit oriented center. In Round Three (2013) the REDC awarded the Town of Babylon $1 million to support a $3.9 million project for the installation of an ice rink within the Intermodal plaza. The first two residential buildings are completed and currently 95 percent leased. The plaza that holds the ice rink during the winter season operates as an open space Spring through Fall to host concerts, markets and other events. Where there was once blight - just a few years ago - is now a vibrant community. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory received an award of $2 million from the LIREDC in Round One (2011) to build an advanced drug testing facility as part of CSHL 's Cancer Therapeutic Initiative in Woodbury. Cold Spring Harbor Lab committed to adding 30 new full-time jobs to their existing workforce of 901. The new facility is complete and currently operational and already making newsworthy breakthroughs in pancreatic cancer research. 13 What We've Done .. . Amneal Pharmaceutical LLC received an award of $3 million in Round One (2011) to support a $117 million project to construct a 322,000-square foot manufacturing and warehouse building and to create 400 new jobs in its generic pharmaceutical company. Construction of the building is complete and machinery and equipment is being purchased and installed. We eagerly anticipate a ribbon-cutting ceremony. ENGine Round One (2011). The LIREDC awarded Hofstra University and Stony Brook University $1 million each for their collaboration to renovate existing facilities and add new teaching equipment in order to increase engineering graduates in the region. Both universities have completed their respective projects and Hofstra increased its engineering enrollment from 225 in 2011 to 472 in 2016 and Stony Brook from 872 in 2011 to 1,572 in 2016. ENGine Round T wo (2012) The LIREDC awarded Farmingdale State College and New York Institute of Technology $250,000 each for their collaboration to continue the work of Hofstra and Stony Brook to increase engineering graduates in our region. Funding went towards equipment and renovations to expand schools of engineering. This phase is also complete and Farmingdale increased its engineering enrollment from 245 in 2011 to 425 in 2016, and New York Institute of Technology from 1,780 in 2011 to 2,644 in 2016. The VetsBuild project through United Way of Long Island was awarded $200,000 in Round Four (2014) to assist low-income military veterans to develop high-demand occupational skills needed to qualify for well-paying jobs. The training prepared the veterans for entry level employment positions in the following jobs: energy auditor, weatherization technician, photovoltaic solar installer, green building construction, and specialty construction worker (SIPs and ICF installer). United Way successfully completed the project training 80 Vetsbuild students with 65 graduates gaining full-time employment. Bay Scallops - Cornell Cooperative Extension was awarded $182,900 in Round One (2011) for machinery and equipment and working capital for scallop restoration in Southold. Their activities included: 1) production of greater numbers of scallops to be used for planting via private/public partnerships with local shellfisheries, 2) collection of scallop larvae from natural populations, 3) concentrated large scale plantings of scallops in Flanders Bay, which is currently under producing, 4) creation of a private culture industry for bay scallops that would produce them on the half-shell for use in NYC restaurants. 14Discover Long Island was awarded ESD Market NY funds of $335,000 in Round Six (2016) for a collaborative marketing project with the East End Tourism Alliance to generate increased awareness of and demand for thematic tourism opportunities, the initiative emphasized locally grown farm, vineyard and sustainable seafood, along with other east end attractions, including tourism activities associated with the rich natural resources unique to the East End. The project is complete. Funds were used to produce ads that emphasized tourism activities across local agricultural and aquaculture sectors, while also highlighting Long Island's beautiful natural assets, its complementary attractions and tourism infrastructure, such as hotels, B&Bs, restaurants, and marinas. Success, especially for an organization that relies heavily on volunteers with very busy lives, can breed a bit of lassitude. So the LIREDC, ably aided by ESD staff, worked harder than ever this year to maintain our momentum. We spoke to more people, generated more articles and broadcasts, partnered with more government and NGO partners, looking for more opportunities to leverage increasingly precious state tax dollars. And sticking to our successful strategies, we continued to invest in critical infrastructure to protect the environment and promote commerce; in innovative research and \"commercialization of discovery;\" in workforce training to close the gap between what our workers can do and businesses need; and in jump-starting job creation in our most underserved communities. Below are examples of how in 2016 we kept making progress - a region on the right track and definitely in motion. In Round Five (2015), Hofstra Education Workforce and Leadership Training Center was awarded an $800,000 ESD Grant for the acquisition and renovation of a vacant Army Reserve Center in Uniondale to create an interdisciplinary community academic facility with high-tech classrooms, offices, and convertible conference-style spaces. Hofstra completed the project and is occupying the building which is bustling with students and the community. In Round Four (2014), Long Island University was awarded a $500,000 ESD Grant for the creation of their Innovation and Entrepreneurship Technology Park. This project, located on the Brookville campus, renovated a former 10,000-square foot \"gold coast\" mansion to accommodate START UP NY companies in a new technology incubator. LIU completed the project and the space currently houses three START UP companies. In Round Four (2014), Adelphi University was awarded a $2.5 million ESD Grant for the construction and renovation of a state-of-the-art 22,000-square foot Nursing Innovation Lab and Training Center. The project involved the acquisition and installation of new specialized machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures. Adelphi committed to the creation of 8 high wage full-time jobs as a result of this project. A ribbon cutting ceremony was held on December 12, 2016 to officially open the building. What We've Done .. . 15 In Round Three (2013), St. Joseph's College was awarded a $800,000 ESD Grant for the renovation of a building on its Patchogue Campus to create a Center for Hospitality and Tourism Management (HTM) in response to economic changes on Long Island and demand for trained hospitality professionals. St. Joseph's committed to create 8 full-time positions as a result of this project. The College has completed this project this year. In Round Five (2015), East/West Industries, Inc. was awarded a $200,000 ESD Grant to support the acquisition of machinery and equipment and renovation of their existing facility to increase the production efficiency of their operation. The company will create 5 jobs to their existing workforce of 49. They design and manufacture support products that save aircrew lives. East/West is a trusted provider of products for military and commercial customers. A ribbon cutting ceremony was held on June 22, 2017 in which they highlighted their new M&E and also shared that they exceeded their initial job commitments by creating 25 full time jobs instead of five. In Round Five (2015), Community Development Corporation of Long Island was awarded $275,000 to construct Peconic Crossing, a 4-story mixed-use building with an art gallery/studio, management/maintenance space, and parking on the first floor and residential units including community space on upper four floors in the Town of Riverhead. They broke ground on this project in March 2017.

When the LIREDC began its work in 2011, Long Island had barely begun to emerge from the Great Recession. Today our region benefits from an economy that is alive with a new dynamism, thanks in no small part to the Council, its work groups and, most of all, the grantees, workers, governments, and communities that we have supported with the help and encouragement of the state. Yet, although unemployment is low and employment is at a record high, much work remains to fill jobs that businesses now report are \"going begging.\" In Round Seven, we are continuing to build on the pillars of the Strategic Plan, while incorporating the guidance and feedback from previous rounds. We will continue to drive innovation and construct career ladders in advanced manufacturing, a key regional tradeable sector. We will expand opportunities in our broad-based biotech cluster, which encompasses jobs ranging from hospitality services delivered in medical facilities to the retraining of displaced defense manufacturing workers for positions in a booming pharmaceutical industry. And we will work across these and other sectors to provide workers with varied levels of formal education and capabilities, with a focus on veterans, special needs populations, displaced workers, and communities of need such as Wyandanch and our DRI areas. Six years in, we have taken stock of past grants, reviewed and expanded our skills gap analysis through a survey of employers and educational institutions, and supported a new set of priority projects that will train students, incumbent workers and the under - or unemployed for the jobs of the future. Key Strategy: Create a cohesive education and workforce training strategy through partnerships among a range of stakeholders - business, trade groups, labor, government agencies, educational institutions, parents and students - with the goal of ensuring that workers from all of Long Island' s communities are prepared to take advantage of new job opportunities in key economic growth sectors.JeaN fitzP atrick NaSSau coMMuNity coLLege WoMeN 'S utiLity traiNee For Jean Fitzpatrick, it was URGENT. After Jean learned her position would be \"outsourced,\" the Massapequa woman wanted - no, needed - to find a decent job at a stable company so she wouldn't be out on the street again at the first economic hiccup. And Jean, a customer service supervisor, knew she would have to sharpen her skills and acquire new ones to compete. That is when she found URGENT - Utility Readiness for Gaining Employment for Non- Traditionals. This innovative program is a partnership of Nassau Community College and the Workforce Development Institute along with New York American Water, PSEG Long Island, and National Grid, and Nassau County Department of Social Services, and the Workforce Development Boards of Hempstead and Oyster Bay towns. Launched in spring of 2017, this free program administered by NCC is designed to train women for job readiness in the utility sector, including the gas, water, and electric industries. The program offers 130-hours of classroom instruction including employability workshops and workplace site visits. Participants earn two industry-recognized certifications and become eligible for employment as electrical technicians, station operators, mechanic trainees, or meter readers. Of twenty-one URGENT graduates, ten have been employed since their May graduation and others are being considered by partner employers. Jean recently started a job with PSEG Long Island and was thrilled at the welcome she received on her first day. \"This opportunity would not have been possible without... the URGENT program,\" Jean shared. \"The classroom instruction was spot on. The field trips... provided a deeper-dive into the inner workings of each utility and in turn highlighted the availability of some great career opportunities. It specifically provided a new and unique network for women.\" The URGENT program inspires women to take a larger role in the utility industry - about as stable a sector as there is on Long Island and contributes to a well-educated and diverse workforce. \"A woman, entering a field that is primarily male- dominated is the very essence of accomplishment.\" 24Survey of Skills Gaps and Inventory of Training Programs In Round Six, the LIREDC's Workforce and Education Work Group convened advisory committees in the health care, manufacturing, IT, agriculture, and retail/hospitality/tourism sectors to provide insights on the changing needs of employers. The work group, in collaboration with the Workforce Development Institute, developed questionnaires for each sector to identify specific and general skill gaps, and then distributed them to at least eight employers in each sector. In some cases, employers needed specific skill sets that require extensive and specialized training - IT firms and manufacturers, for example, both listed \"software development engineer\" among their top five in- demand job titles. But many of the other skills they cited were generalized: IT firms may demand employees who can work in Javascript, but they also need employees trained in \"critical thinking and problem solving.\" Health care firms search for employees with specialized nursing training, but also see active listening and reading and writing comprehension as critical. Employers also expressed needs for broadly-trained workers in their respective fields - manufacturers sought chemists and engineers for a range of applications, for example, while training in basic patient care is highly-demanded in the health care sector. The variation among the needed skill sets led the work group to deepen its employer analysis by adding a second-stage survey of training organizations and two- and four-year educational institutions. This data has enabled the work group to begin the development of a database that matches employers to training opportunities and formal educational programs and certifications at two- and four-year institutions (see Appendix T wo). It has also enabled the work group to analyze the match between the soft and generalized skills that employers are demanding. The results were striking. They showed that Long Island's credit, certificate, and four-year degree programs are already producing many of the skills the region needs. But it was also clear that there is a two-sided information gap: many students, particularly those graduating from four-year colleges - and the faculty who teach them - are not fully aware of the industries that would hire them (e.g., a chemist might not be aware of jobs in Long Island's vineyards). Employers, for their part, do not know where to find skilled employees in area campuses and training programs, and look beyond Long Island - and sometimes beyond New York State - to find talent. Thus, Long Island has training that meets much of the current skills demand, and where it does not exist, programs are agile enough to shift to meet employer needs, particularly in institutions or institutional divisions focused on career readiness. This is not to say that curricula already fulfills all employers' needs or that there is not room for improvement. For example, each industry named industry-contextualized problem solving, offering and receiving communication and feedback, and Quality/Continuous Improvement as critical skills and stated that candidates need to understand how these skills are applied for the specific sector. While training programs and two-year institutions claim \"soft skills\" are included in workforce training it is not evident that they are industry-focused, and they do not appear to be formally integrated into programs that lead to a Bachelor's degree or above. Through the coming year the Workforce and Education Work Group will continue to develop a database that matches academic programs with employers who are eager to recruit on Long Island, and will work to bridge the divide between academic programs and students on one hand and employers on the other. Some of this work will follow the model of the Workforce Development Institute, which recently took representatives from regional colleges and universities on a tour of pharmaceutical companies to illustrate the ample job openings and intense employer need for broadly-trained scientists. The work group hopes to replicate this approach with other manufacturing subsectors, as well as across the biotech sector and the region's other key growth sectors.wHat we'Re doIng ... 25Selected Past / Continuing Projects The LIREDC's workforce grants have targeted workers at every stage of the educational and career pipeline. Grants have leveraged Long Island's colleges and universities as sites of innovation, springboards for entrepreneurship, and linkages to new off-site training for displaced and un/underemployed workers. The LIREDC has focused on preparing students for the jobs of the future in key biotech sectors like pharmaceuticals and high-demand STEM fields like Engineering. The multi-year ENGine initiative provided Hofstra, Stony Brook, Farmingdale, and New York Institute of T echnology $2.5 million to renovate and expand their engineering classrooms, labs, and teaching environments. From 2011 to 2016, engineering enrollments increased more than 45 percent at each institution, and grew 64 percent overall (from 3,112 to 5,113 students). In 2014, Adelphi University was awarded a $2.5 million ESD Grant for a state-of-the-art Nursing Innovation Lab and T raining Center with specialized machinery, equipment, furniture, and fixtures. Adelphi complemented these infrastructural enhancements to education quality by creating eight new high wage full-time positions. A ribbon cutting ceremony was held on December 12, 2016 to officially open the building. LIREDC support has created continuities between institutions of higher learning and the domains of entrepreneurship. In Round 4, Long Island University was awarded a $500,000 ESD Grant to support renovation of a new Innovation and Entrepreneurship Technology Park incubator located on the Brookville campus. The project currently accommodates two START-UP NY tech companies. In 2015, Hofstra University received an $800,000 ESD grant to acquire and renovate a vacant Army Reserve Center into an interdisciplinary Education Workforce and Leadership T raining Center with high-tech classrooms, offices, and convertible conference-style spaces. The technology park opened at the beginning of this year. wHat we'Re doIng ... Joe Saggio fLexibLe SySteMS For Joe Saggio, IT's all about passion and he loves to pass it on. Joe's company, Flexible Systems, provides Professional IT Support, T echnology Consulting, and Cyber Security Services for businesses on Long Island. The company, in the Hauppauge Industrial Park, has 119 employees, plans to be adding about 30 new jobs in an upcoming expansion project and will be looking towards the LIREDC for support. As a partner at Flexible, Joe Saggio is always looking for employees with passion - for technology, for life-long learning and with an intense curiosity about how and why things work. And Joe has found a number of local prospects at Farmingdale College and Stony Brook University. By Joe's account, as part of nurturing the innovation ecosystem sought by the LIREDC, both Stony Brook and Farmingdale have adapted their academic programs to produce students that are truly prepared for work in IT. He enthusiastically proclaimed, \"By their efforts towards reshaping curriculum to reflect what's happening in reality, they are producing students with real skills.\" Joe is most confident about his company's future potential with home grown IT graduates on board, noting, \"The students are working on innovative projects and solving problems using forward thinking which prepares them for the workplace.\" A Stony Brook alum, Joe has developed a collaborative relationship with many professors and enjoys his direct access to the students with whom he speaks in classrooms about the potential for a career in IT. His dedicated efforts have been well worth it, with Flexible Systems acquiring more than twenty IT'ers from Stony Brook last year alone. \"The best part of hiring local talent is that they're graduating from a Long Island university and then staying on Long Island. If local students are able to get a good job here they're more likely to buy a house here and settle down near their family,\" said Joe. \"It also creates longevity for employees. If they can live in an area they're familiar with they'll be more likely to stay at the company for a long time.\" 26St. Joseph's College won an $800,000 ESD Grant to create a Center for Hospitality and Tourism Management (HTM) with eight new positions. HTM is meeting an urgent need for hospitality professionals - not just in the tourism industry but also in fields like healthcare, where patient satisfaction affects reimbursement. In 2015, St. Joe's was awarded a DOL Special Populations T raining Grant of $50,000 to aid un/underemployed residents at the Huntington Opportunity Resource Center (HORC) in Huntington Station. In its first year, the Center logged 1,867 client visits with that number growing daily. To date, faculty, industry professionals, and other volunteers have provided limited one-day evening seminars designed to motivate and groom HORC clients for employment. Non-profit organizations and for-profit groups have played a vital role in offering training to veterans. The United Way of Long Island VetsBuild project received $200,000 to provide vets with the high-demand occupational skills they need to qualify for well-paying jobs. UWLI trained 80 students over two years, and 65 graduates secured full-time employment in construction. Veterans developed specific competencies in green construction; a field the Bureau of Labor Statistics anticipates will grow 34% over the next four years, and boasts a median wage of $57,180. East/West Industries, which designs and manufactures products for aircrews, was awarded an ESD Grant for productivity-increasing new machinery and facility renovations. The company held a ribbon-cutting on June 22, 2017, and announced that they had exceeded their initial job commitments from 5 to 25. wHat we'Re doIng ... Round Seven Priority Projects: Workforce and Education This year, we will continue to bridge that skills gap through the development of innovative programming for students from K-12 to college: The Center for Science, Teaching, and Learning will create Community STEM Centers (CSCs) in Westbury (Long Island's 2016 DRI), South Huntington, Wyandanch, Roosevelt, Central Islip, Amityville, Franklin Square, Nassau Community College (Hempstead Schools), and Brentwood. CSTL is working with local high schools, colleges, and Big Brothers, Big Sisters to secure space in each community. The centers will bring STEM out of the school day, and CSTL staff - together with community and school reps - will develop these spaces to include a Maker Space, computer labs, 3-D printers, and science equipment. Driven by grassroots community planning, each space will offer opportunities for exposure to and training for STEM job opportunities, as well as teacher training and afterschool/summer programming. 27Eastern Suffolk BOCES in Patchogue, Western Suffolk BOCES in Deer Park, and the Long Island School of Nursing Assistants will deliver a Certified Nurse Assistant (CNA) program to 52 participants. The programs will cover basic bedside nursing care, nutritional needs, measuring blood pressure, obtaining temperatures, pulse and respiration procedures, medical ethics, aseptic techniques and clinical supervision. Graduates will be eligible to take the Nurse Aide Evaluation Examination and be listed in the NYS registry. The Suffolk County Development of Labor has made hundreds of contacts with healthcare related companies, unions and associations to identify immediate employment opportunities where these individuals reside. It is expected that 42 of the participants (80%) will graduate and obtain state certification as a Certified Nurse Assistant and potential for additional certifications as described above and 32 (75%) of those that graduate and obtain a certificate will enter training related employment. Farmingdale State College will create three new virtual/augmented reality- equipped labs for its Interaction Design, Visual Communications, Computer Programming and Information Systems, Architectural Engineering Technology, Construction Management, Security Systems and Software Engineering Technology programs, which currently serve 849 students. This technology will allow students to practice in situations that closely mirror the real world, and allow in-person and remote students to meet in 3D environments. In phase 2 of this project, FSC will install web streaming technology for online course delivery . The LIREDC will also leverage private-sector investment to expand employment and training opportunities within our manufacturing sector . LIREDC will support a broad cross-section of manufacturing, including the machining, green energy, advance defense, and food processing subsectors with capital investments and job training: Thuro Metal Products is a family-owned business in Brentwood that employs 54 and provides machined parts for a wide range of industries, including health care. Thuro plans to purchase new CNC machines so the company can expand on the Island, retaining its existing workforce and add two employees. Thuro is also requesting NYS DOL Existing Worker Training funds to support training for 51 employees in critical skills that will improve company productivity. Curtiss Wright- Target Rock is an advanced defense manufacturing leader in Farmingdale that seeks to train mid-level workers with new skills- including courses in Microsoft Project, Project Leadership, Root Cause Analysis and Team Collaboration Training, to be offered at Curtiss Wright headquarters and at Stony Brook University . By reducing waste and improving productivity, the company will be able to face competitive pressures and retain its workforce on Long Island. Abel and Schafer, located in Ronkonkoma, provides the baking industry with high quality mixes and bases. This is an existing employee training program meant to develop a targeted set of skills. This training program will deliver employee skills development in operations management, lean manufacturing, Six Sigma Quality Management and Improvement, and Business Finance Project Management SQF. The industry is projected to grow, and this training program will enable Abel and Schafer to become more competitive and capture market share.wHat we'Re doIng ... 28We will support the biotech/health care industries , which we identified as our major industry cluster in Round Five, and fill the growing number of highly skilled jobs: Luitpold Pharmaceuticals, Inc., located on Eastern Long Island, employs 523 and seeks state support for training its incumbent workers at its Shirley location in leadership skills, project planning and control, business writing skills, and process improvement teams. Funding would help the region retain these jobs and support Luitpold's global competitiveness, efficiency, and quality production. NYU Winthrop Hospital has selected 93 medical billers for a three- day, on-site incumbent worker training as Certified Professional Coders (CPC) who bill insurance carriers for patient visits at 70 medical practices. Trainees will become certified coding experts, empowering them to work autonomously and correct coding errors, improving productivity and streamlining the coding and billing process. Trainees will complete 3 days of instructor-led training, individual and group exercises, live coding scenarios, exam taking techniques, and a mock exam. Upon completion, trainees will take AAPC's CPC exam within 4 weeks. It is anticipated that all 93 trainees will successfully complete the program and achieve the CPC designation. Trainees will be considered for promotion as positions become available. CPC skills are transferable to any healthcare setting. The Town of Oyster Bay, North Hempstead, and City of Glen Cove Workforce Development Board (WDB) aims to close the healthcare sector skills gap between employer demands and workforce supply. The Town proposes to fund training and books for unemployed workers to complete either Medical Office Administration or Medical Billing Specialist programs at Hunter Business School in Levittown. The Medical Office Administration program offers a blend of classroom and hands-on training. Students learn data entry of patient information, patient files, filing systems and records, billing and coding, and accounting using Quickbooks. The program prepares students for entry-level employment in medical billing and coding in hospitals, medical insurance companies, and physicians' offices. Skills acquired in both programs are in high demand. Upon completion of the program, Northwell Health and several other employers will interview trainees for entry-level clerical positions with career pathways. Finally, programs will train workers who face barriers to employment: Stony Brook University will offer training to its staff and faculty on Project Leadership Workshop, Finance for Non-Financial Managers, and Effective Writing for Business. These key skills will help SBU's staff and faculty provide a better education to students, including non-matriculated students referred by local workforce intermediaries (DoL, WDBs) and Veterans Affairs. Many of these referrals face employment barriers, and the training will teach our staff and faculty how to provide guidance and serve these students.wHat we'Re doIng ... 29wHat we'Re doIng ... We Connect the Dots, Laurie Carey Consulting, the Royal Institute for Medical Training, and Savvy Hires will partner with tech firms to create a continuum of services in a new lab and training facility located in Westbury. The initiative supports un/underemployed workers, minorities, low income families, women, veterans, caregivers returning to the workforce and high school students seeking a school-to-work educational plan. The varied offerings will include training in the IT, web, software development, and cybersecurity fields; formal Microsoft certifications, which double as college credit; medical industry certifications; and STREAM career exposure for 13-18 year-olds. Savvy Hires will assist those who complete trainings with job and apprenticeship interviews and placement. The space will feature resident corporations, which provide equipment currently used in their industries to fully outfit each lab. The Utility Readiness for Gaining Employment for Non Traditionals (URGENT) program will provide classroom instruction and workshops to un/underemployed individuals seeking entry-level, field positions in the utility industry. Through a partnership established among National Grid, PSEG-LI, American Water New York, local Workforce Development Boards for the Town of Hempstead and Town of Oyster Bay and WDI, the first URGENT Program targeting women was conducted in Spring 2017. The pilot was successful: 21 of 23 enrollees graduated, a 90 percent completion rate, all of whom secured certificates in Energy Industry Fundamentals and OSHA 10. Students who passed the requisite exam were guaranteed an interview for any posted job. So far 12 job offers have been made. The URGENT partnership (which will now include Con Edison and Suffolk Water Authority) plans to offer seven training cycles over the next 2.5 years using public and private support. Each cycle will consist of 133 hours of classroom instruction, including onsite visits to employer partners, industry-led workshops, math courses, OSHA 10, EIF, and employability workshops. In addition to women, URGENT will target vets and unemployed youth ages 18-24. The Town of Hempstead Department of Occupational Resources will equip eligible trainees with the skills and credentials necessary to advance along career pathways in growth sectors as identified by the LIREDC Strategic Plan and by the NYSDoL Significant Industries inventory. The program will operate at HempsteadWorks Career Center in Hempstead, which offers wrap-around services, including assessment, individual employment plans, supportive services, career counseling, career development workshops, computer skills workshops, and basic skills remediation; classroom training is provided by local colleges, BOCES and proprietary schools. The project will train 78 individuals, including at least 10 veterans, with the expectation that approximately 80% will enter employment. Not only does this project support the REDC's priority of \"training the workforce for today and tomorrow,\" it will also build upon successful sectoral training initiatives for careers developed and implemented by local Workforce Development Boards. 30wHat we'Re doIng ... From the beginning, the Key Strategy cited at the opening of this work group report has been listed as one of our top strategies. And it is no secret why: Workforce training and education is at the heart of our efforts to create an inclusive \"opportunity economy\" that helps workers and businesses tap their full potential and realize their dreams. Now that Long Island has managed to create more jobs than it currently is filling, according to industry leaders, the LIREDC sees its new Job One as closing the employment skills gap by encouraging a broad range of training and education programs. We believe we are off to a great start. 31InnovatIon and IndustR y cLusteRs Long Island is committed to creating a collaborative climate for entrepreneurs and researchers that nurtures rapid growth in biosciences and other innovation enterprises. Long Island: An Innovation Ecosystem Investments in the tremendous research infrastructure at our world- renowned academic institutions, coupled with an entrepreneurial bioscience industry poised for exponential growth, has led to the rise of an innovation ecosystem on Long Island. The LIREDC is committed to nurturing this environment - enriched by cutting-edge discovery at Cold Spring Harbor Labs, Feinstein Institute, Stony Brook University, Winthrop University Hospital, Brookhaven National Labs and other leading research institutions by bringing together scientists, investors, established businesses and other economic drivers. The Regional Council process has put the leadership of these institutions around the same table and generated a new dialogue and fresh ideas on how to harness our technology clusters to form new businesses. Strategy: Increase supply of trained employees A diversified pipeline of well-trained workers is necessary to fuel a thriving innovation economy. Long Island continues to make great strides in educating and training a talented 21st Century STEM workforce that quickly translates their classroom knowledge and hands-on learning experiences into entrepreneurial success stories. These workers are educated on Long Island by innovators, create their own innovative businesses and subsequently, educate a new generation of innovators. The Bio-Entrepreneurs in Residence program at Stony Brook's Center for BioTechnology is a strong example of this innovation ecosystem. Several of the Bio-Entrepreneurs in Residence at the Center, including Andreas Grill (President & CEO of DepYmedInc. ) and Brian McCarthy (Co-founder, President & CEO of Presight Technologies Inc. ) received their education from the best and brightest researchers at Stony Brook, subsequently developed their own innovative companies, and now help educate and advise entrepreneurs on the rise. KEY STRATEGY: Identify and support industry clusters, especially biotechnology, that possess the potential to bring together researchers, educators, investors, manufacturers, and others in a collaborative effort to accelerate the commercialization of technical and scientific discovery and generate jobs at every rung of the employment ladder. WyLe SoLoMoN chief executive officer iceLL geNe theraP euticS Wyle Solomon epitomizes a growing number of global research stars - make that superstars - who are attracted to Long Island for its extraordinary and growing resources in biotech. Solomon was previously a partner at Nordic Biotech ApS, a Danish Venture Capital Firm, served as President, CEO and/or Founder of several companies and Executive Chairman of Forward Pharma A/S (Denmark, Nasdaq: FWP) and Esplanade Pharma Group Limited (Hong Kong). These are just a few of his prestigious positions in the US and around the world. But Solomon was enticed to explore opportunities on Long Island after hearing about the unique, potentially life-saving work being performed at research centers affiliated with Stony Brook University's Center for Biotechnology. \"The Center's Bio-Entrepreneur in Residence program introduces experienced executives to researchers and early stage companies looking to translate their inventions to clinical and commercial successes,\" said Solomon. \"I planned to spend months assessing potential technologies in Long Island and beyond before deciding on my next move. But I became enthralled by one of the first introductions, a company developing advanced cell therapeutics. That has been my focus ever since.\" Operating at the Long Island High T echnology Incubator (LIHTI), iCell Gene Therapeutics captured Solomon's imagination as a company creating futuristic technology being worked on by an exceptional group of research professionals - and with strong commercial, job-creating potential. The company is currently developing Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) engineered cell therapeutics, a technology that had just transitioned from being considered science fiction when Solomon joined the iCell Gene Therapeutics team a year ago as CEO. More recently, the value of CAR therapies is increasingly appreciated for the curative potential for patients considered to have un-treatable hematological cancers. The partnership between iCell Gene Therapeutics and Stony Brook has incredible momentum in advanced therapy research and development - and for promoting Long Island's burgeoning biotech cluster.wHat we'Re doIng ... 32Strategy: Strengthen the innovation and discovery pipeline Collaboration is happening throughout the region. Working with Northwell's Feinstein Institute for Medical Research and the The Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, physicians, researchers and students are working together across disciplines and generations to accelerate biomedical science. Winthrop-University Hospital and NYU Langone Health System announced in April 2017 they will join forces creating a clinically integrated healthcare network spanning NYC and LI. NYU Winthrop Hospital has been an important driver for our biotech strategies and was awarded two Regional Council grants totaling $2.5 million for a now completed research institute focusing on diabetes and obesity in Mineola. Winthrop combining with NYU Langone supports our strategy to foster new collaboration among the top life science institutions downstate. Cold Spring Harbor Lab will soon be home to one of the nation's most innovative centers to integrate biology and human genomics with chemistry and protein data. The Center for Therapeutics Research will attract world-leading chemists who take targets produced from biologists and refine them for next-generation therapies, which will form the basis of new partnerships with the pharmaceutical industry. The ultimate goal of this mission-driven facility is to develop the most advanced drug compounds that are targeted to the underlying biological pathway. This $25 million State-funded project involves the complete reconstruction of the existing building, the construction of a three-story addition on its east side and a new mechanical basement on the west side. Stony Brook University was recently awarded a $75 million state grant for a new institute where medical devices and treatments will be developed and commercialized. The funding will be used to construct a 70,000-square-foot building to be used by the Institute for Discovery and Innovation in Medicine & Engineering, or I-DIME . The facility will provide a place where cutting edge academic research and data analytic support come together with private-sector ingenuity to solve challenging problems. I-DIME will serve as a magnet for companies and will result in the development of new products and markets. wHat we'Re doIng ... 33wHat we'Re doIng ... At Stony Brook Medicine, medical researchers have made leaps and bounds in the past year. T wo Stony Brook University cell biologists, David Matus and Benjamin Martin, have discovered that cell division and invasion are mutually exclusive behaviors. The discovery leads to a better understanding of how tumors are spread, helping scientists design new drugs that attack cancer cells. The Regional Council has supported these types of efforts including funding in Round Five for Stony Brook's new Cryo Electron microscope. This $4M investment allows researchers to see, at extraordinary magnification, molecules that are studied in drug discovery. Investments like this also support a workforce development strategy. The region strives to prepare young people for careers in medicine, pharma and research so access to world class research equipment becomes an important teaching tool. Revolutionizing medicine, Danny Bluestein, a professor of biomedical engineering and the director of Biofluids Research Group, is working on optimizing and testing cardio vascular prosthetic devices using in silico computer simulations with benchtop lab testing. Stony Brook researcher Milutin Stanacevic is working on an electronic pill that one day will be able to communicate with doctors from inside the patient's body. Cold Spring Harbor Lab recently celebrated the FDA approval of Spinraza a drug based on CSHL insights into alternative RNA splicing used to treat spinal muscular atrophy, a childhood neurodegenerative disease. These examples are merely snapshots of the vast and diverse scientific research being conducted on Long Island, which has tremendous promise to lead to the greatest advances in medicine and technology of the 21st Century. 34 Emblematic of the organic expansion of Long Island's innovation ecosystem into our neighboring regions, LIBH's success has prompted LIREDC to support the creation of the New York Bioscience Hub (NYBH) as an effective platform to accelerate the development of academic innovations into new biomedical products and companies across the downstate region. LIBH continues to disrupt the frustrating exodus of locally discovered biomedical innovations to industry clusters outside New York State by providing the infrastructure for early stage development and commercialization within the region. The NYBH expansion will foster strategic partnerships between the downstate bioscience industry leaders, fuel company formation and job creation, and attract inbound investment - elevating the biotech industry in our region to the next level of success. tiffaNy tSui Director of oPeratioNS eNviSageNicS Tiffany Tsui, Director of Operations for Envisagenics Inc., is a successful product of Long Island's innovation ecosystem. Additionally, her career highlights the diverse opportunities for job seekers in biotech. Tsui received her doctorate in Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology from Stony Brook University, immersing herself in the fundamentals of the bioscience industry as a fellow at the school's Center for Biotechnology. Upon completing an internship at Envisagenics as a full-fledged member of Long Island's research community, Tsui was hired by the biotech company as Director of Operations. Envisagenics is a bioinformatics company that spun out of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). The company's mission is to reduce the complexity of biomedical data to facilitate the development of innovative therapeutic solutions. \"Long Island has a tremendous amount of resources for start-up companies which include well-respected research institutions and an extremely supportive community of entrepreneurs who are more than happy to mentor and share their experiences to budding entrepreneurs in the region,\" said Tsui. \"I know that Envisagenics leveraged many of these key resources along our path to success and we remain well connected to our network on Long Island.\" Envisagenics envisions a future in which computerized predictive models will lower time and cost of drug development. Tsui is tasked with many atypical STEM field job duties, including streamlining operational functions such as best practices for managing budgets and human resource benefits, preparing materials for investor meetings, and managing talent recruitment. Continuing to grow exponentially, Envisagenics recently moved out of CSHL on Long Island and into Manhattan. This move symbolizes Long Island's leadership role in New York State, taking on a big picture view of helping to foster not just the Long Island economy, but the regional biotech economy. \"We frequently communicate with Cold Spring Harbor and continue to collaborate with the researchers working at the Long Island lab we spun out of. The conversation surrounding biotech success should not be about 'Long Island' verses 'Manhattan'... it should be about working as a team to make New York the number one biotech region in the country.\"wHat we'Re doIng ... Strategy: Grow and Retain Business The Long Island Bioscience Hub , dedicated to the commercialization of biomedical innovations, fostering company formation and accelerating bioscience industry growth, represents both the thirst for biotech innovation on Long Island and the growing economic success of the biotech industry in our region. LIBH has an estimated annual economic impact of $80 million in creating jobs and forming companies that are revolutionizing biomedicine and biotechnology.35 It is not just the Bioscience Hub that is trying to link the downstate region as a formidable force in life sciences. A tri-region effort, which last year brought together Long Island, New York City and Mid-Hudson, has begun to create a powerful research corridor by harnessing regional leadership, research institutions and life science companies. The vision is that \"three is stronger than one\" when it comes to attracting venture capital, attracting federal research dollars, collaborating on research and technology commercialization and supporting a biotech cluster in downstate New York. This fledgling initiative has moved quickly from an idea to an invitation for participation by research leaders and companies like Regeneron in Westchester, Alexandria Center for Life Science in New York and BioBat at the Brooklyn Army Terminal, and Stony Brook University, Cold Spring Harbor Labs, The Feinstein Institute and Brookhaven Labs. Meanwhile, the Manufacturing and Technology Resource Consortium is up and running at Stony Brook University, collaborating with colleges and institutions throughout the region to improve the skillsets and knowledge of entrepreneurs, researchers and other members of our workforce. Funded by ESD's NYSTAR division, MTRC has worked with over 50 companies in our region, supporting our priority industry cluster: biotechnology. MTRC has issued over $330,000 in supplemental awards to Long Island's small to medium-sized manufacturing companies engaged in research, continuous improvement, product development and technology acceleration, as well as workforce training. MTRC supports small and midsize manufacturers. Furthermore, coordinated government efforts are underway to learn more about how to assist biotech entrepreneurs on Long Island. For instance, the Suffolk County Industrial Development Agency held two forums with life science company leadership. Each forum included approximately 15 life science companies that were encouraged to share ideas in which Suffolk could help the companies create jobs and grow their business. Follow up meetings are currently being scheduled. wHat we'Re doIng ... 36Strategy: Recruit a \"Big Dog\" Pharma Company Stony Brook will soon house an Innovation & Discovery Center. The Center was conceived in the design of a mezzanine structure to promote growth of start-up businesses and attract innovative new companies in the areas of biotechnology, information technology, electronics, and advanced materials and processing. It provides an infrastructure that helps Stony Brook incubator companies to step up to the \"next level\" before entering the open market, facilitating success and fostering well-paying new job opportunities. The Innovation & Discovery Center will also foster collaboration with large strategic companies, including big foreign biotech firms that have a foothold in New York and are in need of innovative satellite office space and access to a diverse pipeline of STEM workers in close proximity to Manhattan. A groundbreaking is scheduled for fall 2017. The work of the Long Island Association's LI-Bio Initiative also will assist in the recruitment of large pharmaceutical companies. LI-Bio has met periodically since its inception last year, bringing together various companies in the industry to network and share ideas for the continued development of an innovation economy in the region. The committee is currently working on several initiatives to increase partnerships and provide resources. Over at the Broad Hollow Bioscience Park at Farmingdale State College, commercial real-estate broker, Jones Lang LaSalle, was hired in March to market the 62,000 square foot facility. The 3 Bioscience Park facility, 40,500 square feet, could be nearly fully leased by the end of the year as Broad Hollow has a number of tenants in the process of finalizing agreements. SharoN kLugeWicz cheMbio DiagNoSticS SySteM iNc. Sharon Klugewicz serves as an excellent example of Long Island's organic, economic ecosystem of innovative leaders who are educated on Long Island, go on to lead innovative businesses on Long Island, and subsequently serve as mentors to a new generation of innovators. Sharon also is an inspiration to women seeking executive careers in high-tech. Sharon joined Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc. in September 2012 and serves as President, Americas Region. In this role she is responsible for driving regional sales, global marketing, customer service, and has oversight of the quality assurance & regulatory affairs functions. Klugewicz joined Chembio as Vice President, QA/QC, and immediately moved into the role as Chief Operating Officer, where she led Manufacturing Operations, Quality Systems, Product Development, and Regulatory Affairs. Prior to joining the Medford based diagnostics company, Klugewicz served as Sr. Vice President of Scientific & Laboratory Services at Pall Corporation (based in Port Washington, and later acquired by Danaher Corporation). She previously held executive leadership positions in the Pall Life Sciences Division, including Global Quality Operations, Field T echnical Services, Marketing, and Product Management. Klugewicz received a B.S. in Neurobiology from Stony Brook University and a M.S. in Biochemistry from Adelphi University. In addition to her example as a product of our innovation ecosystem, Sharon's responsibilities as President, Americas Region, of Chembio, and previously as COO, highlight the opportunities in biotech for experts in fields beyond basic research - such as Marketing and Product Portfolio Management, Quality Systems, Manufacturing Operations, and Product Development. She also highlights the possibilities for successful women in technology. wHat we'Re doIng ... 37Strategy: Increase financial resources for biotech Long Island applauds Governor Cuomo for announcing a groundbreaking $620 million initiative to spur growth of a new, world-class life science research cluster in New York as well as expanding the state's ability to commercialize this research and grow the economy. Our Long Island biotech leaders are in midst of putting together strong proposals for this funding, including the aforementioned New York Bioscience Hub. In April 2017, New York State announced an investment of $15 million in funding for a Cryo-Electron Microscopy (CryoEM) Facility to be located at Brookhaven National Labs. Establishing a CryoEM Facility will provide a foundation for our growing biotech industry. Combining the full suite of capabilities with Brookhaven Lab's expertise in data and instrument development will dramatically accelerate the determination of biostructures that are key to such things as battling against disease. With federal funding support from the Department of Energy, upgrades to BNL 's isotope production and research facility has increased the yield of key medical isotopes, which very well could lead to the cure for many forms of cancer, including leukemia and melanoma. Federally funded research at BNL has also led Long Island scientists to make recent major advances that could spur increased production of biofuels and other sustainable plant based products. The Long Island Bioscience Hub (LIBH) announced $400,000 in total funding for five new projects including researchers exploring technologies for life threatening blood infections, a novel therapeutic for the treatment of colorectal cancer, and a next-generation medical imaging tool with applications in mammography. Strategy: Bolster efforts to manufacture more biotech products Leaders in government, academia and private industry are constantly seeking opportunities to increase the manufacturing of biotech products on Long Island in addition to boosting biotech agriculture efforts. Kelp is a unique and innovative area of manufacturing that Long Island is exploring that directly connects to boosting our biotech industry. The crop cultivated from the Peconic Bay is a huge potential money maker with an intriguing bounty of benefits. In addition to being a healthy culinary craze touted from Asia all the way to the British Isles, kelp works as a sponge to clean waters suffocating in nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon. The seafaring crop's popularity has caught the eye of Suffolk County, which has approved a carefully regulated kelp harvesting pilot program in the hopes of creating jobs, boosting biotech agriculture efforts and simultaneously cleaning the waterways. Strategy: Create economic incentives tailored to biotech need. In 2017, Accelerate Long Island launched its second venture fund. Funded by a partnership with ESD, ALI is investing in startups founded on emerging technologies. Research universities are the primary source of deal flow and Stony Brook is certainly high on the list with several companies utilizing Stony Brook inventions currently under consideration. Over 2-3 years, ALI will invest in 20-25 companies. These emerging growth companies bring with them exceptionally high job growth multipliers and are prized contributors to economic development. wHat we'Re doIng ... 38wHat we'Re doIng ... It is not only biotechnology getting all of our attention: A strong ecosystem means that no sector is ignored and we recognize that the scientist researching molecules in a lab is no more or less important to our region than the worker creating new code to improve software platforms. We are supporting a myriad of industry clusters that develop products, offer technology services and enhance our tradeable sectors. In fact when we selected biotechnology two years ago it was immediately recognized that multiple clusters related to, and supported, our life sciences industry. It is the IT staffer working on big data labs who communicates with the scientist in the lab. It is the craftsman metal bender working in manufacturing plants creating the metal housing of a new medical device. It would be impossible (and short-sighted) to ignore the inter- relationship of our tech and manufacturing sectors on Long Island and we have put our precious dollars into projects that support more than just life sciences. The big data scientist working at Brookhaven Labs could tomorrow be working on defense and aerospace products. It is that inextricable relationship among clusters that resulted in the state funding for projects like NeuLion that will create new IT jobs in Melville, WebAir whose IT company will expand in Garden City - in a former building that once housed Doubleday Publishing - or LBi Software Inc. whose IT technicians create software used by major league baseball. The region is supporting other clusters like electronics and communication, and funded projects for L3 Communications in Hauppauge and Comtech in Melville. Creating new jobs for skilled workers in multiple industries strengthens our economy and it makes a downturn in one cluster much less impactful. We witnessed 20 years ago how being too dependent on a single sector - defense - could devastate the regional economy. Investments to support non-biotech clusters are seen in last year's funding for a food incubator at Old Bethpage and this year's funding for Wyandanch's Digital Ball Park to be located at Wyandanch Rising. Space for new IT start up companies in the midst of what was Long Island's most distressed community will support our Opportunity Agenda and our premise in 2011 that Wyandanch is deserving of investment and can be a model for transit oriented space where people can live, work and play. And finally, as you will see in our Workforce and Education Work Group's report, we also believe that just as not only biosciences are getting our attention neither are only PhD's and engineers. We have been careful to ensure that our innovation ecosystem includes people with a variety of skillsets and a diversity of backgrounds. No matter how sophisticated the industry, there is a place for every Long Islander and a potential center of excellence in every community. Long Island's expanding innovation ecosystem is nurturing the commercialization of discovery with partnerships among major research institutions and corporations that would not be possible without the collaborative environment fostered by the LIREDC. The key is accelerated job creation that not only transforms the prospects of an economy but thousands of families now benefitting from a better financial future. 39wHat we'Re doIng ... Round Seven Priority Projects: Innovation Cold Spring Harbor Labs. The world-renowned research center is seeking funding for a vital screening microscope to maximize the capabilities of CSHL's Cryo-Electron Microscope (Cryo-EM). The work being done in this facility will enhance our understanding of biological structures and in the future lead to the development of effective therapeutics for cancer and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. CSHL purchased a Cryo-EM in 2017 to strengthen its research capabilities. A screening microscope will be utilized prior to the Cryo-EM and will help prepare the samples for viewing so they are in their best condition. The precious time saved will allow the maximum number of scientists to use the Cryo-EM and also facilitate training, advancing strategies for innovation, industry clusters and workforce development. Feinstein Institute for Medical Research. Northwell Health, of which Feinstein is a part, has positioned itself to become the nation's leader in translational genetics and genomics. Northwell will unify its academic and clinical missions by building upon its research programs and clinical divisions, its new strategic alliance with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, its innovative The Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, and the tremendous ethnic diversity of people the health system serves and employs. Ultimately, genomics will be part of every patient visit. Thus, Feinstein needs a high-speed network and hardware, and an intellectual critical mass. To improve data sharing and increase data transmission speeds, Northwell Health is planning to establish the Computational Genomics Center. These resources, in turn, will allow Feinstein to recruit a new team to investigate the genetics of cancer risk and response to therapy. The team also will facilitate collaborations with Northwell Cancer Institute, Cohen's Children's Medical Center, Cold Spring Harbor, Hofstra, and the New York Genome Center. The research is hoped to lead to new clinical protocols, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Enzo. A pioneer in genetic testing with its 41 years in New York State, Enzo develops technology, manufactures products and provides diagnostic services, including a clinical lab on Long Island. To remain competitive in that location, and tap more deeply into an $8 billion market, Enzo will create a clinical facility with a focus on pre- and post-natal genetic testing. This means the testing will no longer be done at its California facility, effectively transferring jobs and revenues to Long Island and insuring the sustainability of its NY operations. New York will also benefit from the local availability of this specialty testing for healthcare professionals. The project will require an expansion of its current and acquisition of specific sophisticated equipment to run the tests. Eastern Wholesale Fence. The overall goal of this project is to increase manufacturing innovation and efficiency by blending resins on Long Island instead of procuring it from out of state suppliers. Essential to the strategy of in-house production is construction of a state of the art PVC resin blending operation that will allow Eastern to, in effect, \"bring home\" jobs from Texas since the firm would be producing the 40 million pounds of PVC resin on Long Island. PVC resin blending is a critical to increasing sales, capturing additional market share and allowing the company to reinvest in and expand on Long Island. It also will be able to develop innovative products such as foam deck and board 40wHat we'Re doIng ... extrusions and to provide blended resin to several other NYS businesses that currently purchase PVC resin from out of state suppliers. These companies will be able to buy PVC at much lower costs, enabling them to be more competitive nationally and globally. The project will mean 30 new jobs at Eastern alone. Autronics Plastics. This project includes the renovation of a 20,000 square foot section of the plant to create a metal fabrication department. Reconditioning the space and adding other amenities will allow Autronics, which already provides LED lighting for NYC transit agencies, to seek new business and create additional jobs by providing wireway and metal components for subway station and tunnel renovation. API has already received purchase orders for some of these projects. The outcome will be a state-of-the-art metal fabrication facility to complement its injection molding, tool building, and electronic assembly and become an integrated LED luminaire/fixture manufacturer. Graphene 3D Labs. The company specializes in advance materials with an existing product line of 3D conductive printing materials and conductive epoxies. This project, which fits with our strategies of promoting cutting-edge manufacturing on Long Island, will help further the plans to expand to new product lines in advance materials for injection molding. They are planning to move from a small space in the Calverton business incubator to a larger space to create a manufacturing facility. We see this as part of promoting our innovation ecosystem by assisting a promising firm from incubation to production. Johnson and Hoffman . In the past, J&H has mostly built products for the automotive industry but, with the assistance of New York State, the company will look to grow its non-automotive business over the next several years into a variety of cutting edge sectors. The company will use these investments to add jobs, provide training and invest in new manufacturing equipment and new tools for production. J&H expects not only to retain its existing workforce of 65 but add 25 new jobs to produce non-automotive products. 41Infrastructure Placemaking - creating diverse, transit-linked neighborhoods where people can live, work and play - remains a priority for Long Island as we strive to build a sustainably strong \"opportunity economy\" for young and old alike. A Fierce Urgency In our first strategic plan, the LIREDC recognized that substantial investments in infrastructure - particularly to strengthen village downtowns with Long Island Rail Road stations - were essential to Long Island's robust growth, and will be indispensible to its revitalization. America's First Suburb, like many of its counterparts around the country, is grappling with the challenges of an aging and outdated transportation system; failing or absent sewers; homogenous and unaffordable housing stock; deteriorating downtowns and commercial areas; and outdated land use policies that often seem to obstruct promising projects more than protect the environment and community character. That's why even as we have recommended a number of projects in the past six years that have paid off in revitalized neighborhoods, including several in our poorest communities, the urgency to invest \"smartly\" in transportation, rental apartments and other \"unsexy\" but crucial infrastructure remains just as fierce. The infrastructure imperative, however, is more than just sewers and apartments. The LIREDC has remained committed to investing in arts facilities and programs that will attract people to downtowns, where access to rail and bus service means fewer cars congesting the roads and more people on Main Street sidewalks. In Riverhead, Patchogue, Westbury, Bay Shore and other villages where residents craved a better day, one of the first transformative improvements was a performance space that brought people downtown to the theater and surrounding restaurants. That's why the LIREDC enthusiastically supported the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in Wyandanch and capital funds for the refurbishment of a theater in Babylon.wHat we'Re doIng ... Key Strategy: Rebuild and expand infrastructure to improve job access, revitalize downtowns and transit hubs, speed trade, and attract and retain dynamic regional businesses and highly skilled workers. Key Strategy: Develop innovation and industry clusters in transformative locations across the region -including downtowns, brownfields and university, research and medical centers - by integrating the smart- growth principles of transit-oriented development and vibrant community life. Dave kaPeLL forMer Mayor viLLage of greeNPort Sometimes you get one shot, and years of experience in local government and regional engagement had prepared Dave Kapell for his \"moment\" in December 2015 when he literally cornered Governor Cuomo at a statehouse reception for regional economic development councils. Dave wanted the Governor to support nothing less than a $2 billion investment in a third track for the Long Island Rail Road's main line. Dave told him the additional track would generate many billions more in economic activity by shortening travel times, encouraging reverse commuting, and accelerating long-overdue safety improvements. Dave, a former well-respected mayor of Greenport and graduate of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, also said the third track would go hand in hand with transit- oriented redevelopment initiatives in village downtowns. As Governor Cuomo would tell it, Dave was persuasive - so much so that the governor eventually decided to put his administration behind a push to make the track Long Island's key infrastructure priority for the past two years. And in the spring of 2017, the funds were approved. \"The report made clear to me that the LIRR is the vascular system for economic activity on LI and that the Main Line is the system's clogged artery,\" Dave said, referring to a 2013 analysis by the Rauch Foundation's Long Island Index that inspired a regional consensus for the transformative project. \"But three years after the formation of a Long Island taskforce to gain state approval, it was also clear that more aggressive action was necessary to move the project forward.\" Like, approaching a governor at his own party. Dave acknowledges the importance of the LIREDC in generating support for the third track, including direct involvement by members of the council in reaching out to state lawmakers and the few resistant local officials. In fact, in recognition of LIREDC's role as a regional catalyst, this year Dave joined the council. \"We still have so much work to do on Long Island,\" Dave said, \"and the only way to get it done is by working together.\" 42wHat we'Re doIng ... Infrastructure is literally the foundation for job creation. We have seen the benefits of our strategies in Wyandanch, Westbury, Glen Cove, Patchogue, Coram and other newly vibrant places. We also know the consequences of slowing down the pipeline of projects: A Long Island suffering from economic stagnation and social dysfunction. Considering the premium we have placed on promoting successful, inclusive places, we are determined not to let that happen. Placemaking Momentum Long Island is building more rentals, co-ops, condominiums and other multifamily homes than it has in previous decades. The consensus-building clout of the LIREDC and its influential, engaged members has helped change attitudes about affordable, smart- growth, transit-oriented development in our downtowns. The Council also has \"put its money where its mouth is\" by investing tens of millions of dollars into mixed use projects with an emphasis on \"workforce\" rentals. But it's not enough. Even in a \"built environment\" where \"greenspace\" is at a premium, a study by the Long Island Index indicated that Long Island has the potential to add more than 150,000 households in the next 20 years. Good news - except that if housing construction continues along current trends, we are likely to build less than half of the new housing units needed to meet this demand. And that would mean losing thousands of promising workers, investors and others who can help us grow our economy and diversify our communities. The argument for more variety - and affordability - in housing stock is strong. With housing prices rising again, more and more communities are beyond the reach of many working people. And surveys indicate that an increasing number of young professional Millennials, as well as aging Baby Boomers, prefer walkable, mixed-use communities with amenities and character. Much of the focus of housing advocates has been on Millennials, who only recently have shown signs of desire for Long Island and other suburbs. But the Baby Boom population, already the predominant economic force in the region, is expected to grow by 50 percent in the next couple of decades and many of them will be looking to downsize from their single- family homes. If Long Island does not have what they are looking for, especially after they retire and warmer, less expensive places beckon, they will take their incomes, savings and expertise elsewhere. We can't let that happen. 43Progress in Construction The following projects reflect progress toward LIREDC infrastructure strategies that have helped remake whole communities, creating jobs and even hope where neither had been seen in decades. Glen Cove The City of Glen Cove is experiencing a growing population primarily in connection with its downtown and waterfront revitalization efforts. That, in turn, is stimulating an economy that had been sagging for more than a generation. Many new businesses have opened during the past three years, creating jobs in the process. And there is room for more. The LIREDC has designated Glen Cove's downtown and waterfront revitalization area as projects of regional significance. The New York Metropolitan Transportation Council (NYMTC) expects Glen Cove to add more than 8,000 people by 2050. The 2010 Long Island Index \"Places to Grow\" report said the downtown had a high potential for redevelopment, based on the amount of undeveloped land, LIRR ridership, and existing density and mix of uses. Three new large developments are currently under construction or approved to begin. The Garvies Point waterfront, on the north side of Glen Cove Creek, will include 1,110 new residential units. The Village Square project, which is located in the Downtown Business Improvement District will have 140 units and the Villa project, a few blocks south of the downtown near the Western Gateway, will include 160 new residential units. The synergies should be explosive. Riverhead Arts, as well as apartments, are helping to bring back this pivotally-positioned former \"market town\" at the gateway to the North and South Forks. The look and feel of Riverhead's Main Street is changing with the addition of a theater, aquarium, hotel, art galleries and newly proposed apartment buildings. The LIREDC recognizes the importance of Riverhead's downtown as key to expanding economic opportunity in a community that fell on hard times following the closing of a massive research, development and testing facility for an aerospace firm. Regional and local leaders have struggled over the years to attract investment but signs of momentum are showing up along the key commercial district. Peconic Crossing is the latest example of a project that will continue to make Riverhead an appealing downtown for tourists and residents alike. Peconic Crossing, developed by the Community Development Corporation of Long Island, will create 45 affordable energy-efficient, one- and two-bedroom apartment homes with a preference to artists and households earning up to 60 percent of Area Median Income. This new downtown residence will also assist the area's population previously displaced by Superstorm Sandy, a weather event from which we are still recovering. The LIREDC is always looking for opportunities to help communities recover and build resiliency in ways that create jobs and other economic activity.The complex includes a rooftop terrace overlooking the adjacent Peconic River, a true visual inspiration to the artists in residence. Additionally, the creation of gallery space - supported by the LIREDC - will provide a venue for artists to exhibit their work and meet with peers and potential customers. The project will entice young people, retirees and families seeking arts-based entertainment within a pedestrian setting. Located in the heart of Downtown Riverhead, home to the East End Arts Council, Peconic Crossing residents themselves will enjoy walking or biking to work, restaurants, shops and more. wHat we'Re doIng ... 44wHat we'Re doIng ... Huntington Station Over the last decade, Huntington Station revitalization projects have benefited from public investment including various grant awards from all levels of government. The funding support has assisted critical capital infrastructure improvements such as the construction of a pedestrian plaza space, acquisition and development of Huntington Station's downtown Gateway Park, and a comprehensive streetscaping campaign within Huntington Station's business corridor. LIREDC investments in Huntington Station to date include $1.5 million for the reconstruction of the James D. Conte Community Center, a former NYS Armory. When completed, it will serve as a collaborative venue for not-for-profits and other agencies to interact with town initiatives and agencies, such as the Huntington Business Incubator and Huntington Opportunity Resource Center. An additional $370,000 in NYS funds enabled the recent restoration of a historic farmhouse within Gateway Park. Restore NY funds helped support Columbia Terrace, an affordable military veterans' 14-unit condo project, and the Gateway Mixed Use Retail Center, both nearing construction phase. The Huntington Opportunity Resource Center, a mixed-use building rehabilitated with support of New York Main Street grant funds, recently launched its Unemployed Worker Training Program. The Resource Center's job training program delivered basic writing, math, and computer skills to nearly 100 residents in pursuit of jobs. Additionally, the NYS Brownfield Opportunity Area program awarded Huntington Station a total of $340,000 for planning and community outreach. Housing is also an important component. With the Town's commitment and public funding directed at Huntington Station, the area has realized construction of more than 300 rental units, 44 of which are affordable. Ronkonkoma Hub The Ronkonkoma Hub transit-oriented development project will offer new and diverse housing opportunities for Long Island residents next to the busy Ronkonkoma LIRR station, while addressing the shortage of multifamily rentals. Strategically located between the Long Island Expressway and Long Island MacArthur Airport, the Ronkonkoma Hub will be at the center of road, rail and air. The development is close to major research assets including Stony Brook University and Brookhaven National Laboratory. A $50 million NYS Grant will fund parking garages for the $650 million Ronkonkoma Hub development, which will transform approximately 50 acres. Upon completion, in about a decade, the Hub is expected to have 1,450 apartments and 545,000 square feet of retail and office space. The project will ultimately transform a struggling commercial district, create hundreds of jobs and provide affordable housing for seniors and young people. 45wHat we'Re doIng ... Progress in Planning East Farmingdale Downtown Center This winter, a five-day design charrette was held in East Farmingdale to refine ideas for a new transit-oriented development that will surround a LIRR station scheduled to be reopened. The Town of Babylon is planning for the redevelopment of 136 acres in East Farmingdale as part of a mixed-use development along the Route 110 corridor, home to 20 percent of Suffolk County's workforce. It is the largest job center on Long Island. The East Farmingdale Downtown Center would be a regional destination around the Republic Station, including retail, residences, public spaces and parking, making it potentially a major mass transit hub. Reclaiming Suffolk County's Water and Improving Coastal Resiliency \"Long Island's unparalleled natural beauty, from the stunning coastline to the spectacular waters, is a key driver of the regional economy, and we must do everything in our power to protect the water quality and natural resources of our communities,\" Governor Cuomo said at a recent event on Long Island to address brown tide and harmful algae blooms. And so we are. The water quality problem is acute in Suffolk County. With 360,000 septic systems, Suffolk has roughly the same number as all of New Jersey. \"What we have been doing for decades is just managing the decline of water quality,\" Steve Bellone, the Suffolk County executive, noted at the same event held by the Governor. Nassau County has many more homes using sewers than Suffolk, where 75 percent of the population relies on septic systems. Officials from the governor to village board members now understand that Long Island faces no greater challenge than the water quality crisis from nitrogen infiltration from failing septic systems and cesspools. Consistent with recommendations of the LIREDC as well as the governor's 2100 Commission report, the challenge is to reduce nonpoint source pollution and restore wetlands. By initiation of this comprehensive project, Suffolk proposes to strengthen our south shore coastal wetlands. This Manhattan Project-like effort will provide advanced wastewater infrastructure to reduce nitrogen currently discharged into the Carlls River, Connetquot River, and Forge River. The goal for the county - heartily endorsed and supported by LIREDC - is improving wetlands through nitrogen reduction that not only will have environmental benefits, but mitigate property and business losses associated with future storms. 46wHat we'Re doIng ... Round Seven Priority Projects: Infrastructure We can't lose momentum; the stakes are too high for the health of too many families and the future of the regional economy. To further our key strategies and continue the progress we've so painstakingly made in the last six years, the LIREDC recommends the following projects for funding in Round Seven: Upper Port Jefferson . This troubled gateway neighborhood to one of Long Island's most desirable waterfront villages will be transformed into a compact, pedestrian-friendly community surrounding a Long Island Rail Road station. Upper Port, which was an appealing candidate for a Downtown Revitalization Initiative designation, will offer a range of affordable living options with a core central business district and mass transit providing access to high-paying jobs, cultural attractions and higher education. The area presents a unique opportunity to revitalize this troubled area and rebrand it to create a vibrant, young urban landscape and pulse, as called for in the LIREDC strategic vision. Plans call for replacing derelict, crime- ridden buildings with mixed-use development, streetscapes, traffic calming and connectivity, lighting, and improved bus/train access and parking. Point Lookout. Currently un-sewered, this mostly residential community of 1,267 on the eastern side of Long Beach relies on on-site treatment for its septic systems that have the potential for nitrogen leaks. In the past, the systems have failed, including during Superstorm Sandy, threatening the health of the community and the nearby Western Bays that house salt marshes vital to the coastal resiliency of the south shore. Because of these threats, Nassau County is pursuing the construction of a new collection system for Point Lookout - with LIREDC support - that will become part of the County's Sewer and Stormwater Collection Waterfront District. Nitrogen reduction is part of the County's master vision for nearby bays, as well as a broader initiative in other south shore communities. This will help build resiliency in anticipation of another major storm. Hempstead Village Redevelopment. The Carman Place project is hoped to be a spark to jumpstart the ambitious and desperately needed \"Hempstead Rising\" redevelopment that would bring 600,000 square feet of new commercial space and 3,400 new residences. Carman Place, a project of the well-respected Community Development Corp. of Long Island, will start the revitalization with nearly 24,000 square feet of commercial space and 228 affordable apartments. The first phase will include construction of infrastructure improvements to support the commercial space. The second will be the construction of the commercial and residential buildings. The ESD funds will leverage over $94 million in federal, state and private investment. The goal is to transform one of LI's poorest communities into a vibrant commercial and residential center that takes great advantage of its superb public transit options. Huntington Parking. One of Suffolk County's premier retail and residential downtowns, Huntington's popularity has translated into parking problems that have stymied smart-growth initiatives, including affordable apartments that are important LIREDC priorities. This project will deliver a three-story municipal parking deck, with green energy features, on the footprint of an existing lot. The new structure will create a \"shared parking dynamic\" in which spaces have double duty, accommodating shoppers during the day and revelers and residential apartment dwellers at night. Overall, the 528 spaces, all desperately needed in the busy downtown, will triple available parking at that location. The structure's size and scale will be consistent with existing buildings. Addressing the shortage of parking will open the door for more mixed-use development and meet the increasing public demand for more apartments. 47wHat we'Re doIng ... Global NY Governor Cuomo's program to pump up exports and foreign investment has been embraced by the LIREDC and more and more firms as a shot in the arm for job creation and retention. Governor Cuomo's launch of Global NY left no doubt that New York is open for business - to the world. And it's a good thing: Long Island's exports have grown to nearly $10 billion, an increasing chunk of the economy, especially in the tech sector that the Long Island Regional Economic Development Council has been promoting from day one. But there's plenty of room for growth, and Global NY is key to nurturing exports and foreign direct investment, which can be an incredible stimulant to a local economy. Through the Global NY initiative, businesses are provided opportunities to participate in trade shows as well as getting in front of businesses and distributors across the globe. This popular \"one-stop\" initiative, created by Governor Cuomo, allows LI companies to sell their products offshore - and keep profits and jobs on our shores. The LIREDC continues to embrace Global NY - which aligns with several of our key strategies, including the one above - by promoting its events and by creating a separate Global NY Work Group. Now into Round Seven of the Governor's game-changing economic development initiative, the LIREDC continues to analyze Global NY's impact and spread the word about the benefits it brings to local businesses. The Global NY initiative especially allows the region to leverage our technology sectors and biotech clusters in a more systematic and synergistic way. A recent article in Newsday reported that exports from Long Island have grown 53% since 2005, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau. This demonstrates that exporting products and services from Long Island to other parts of the world has had a positive impact on our region's economy. It also is good publicity for the state and LIREDC's efforts.

The regional Empire State Development office offered a \"Doing Business in Europe\" event on October 27, 2016. This was a dual meeting as we leveraged our time by having local staff as well as ESD staff from the London office to discuss opportunities to export to Europe. One meeting was attended by over 20 local companies from aerospace, electronics, food and winery sectors and the other included six local Industrial Development Agencies (IDAs). These meetings emphasized that Long Island is a great global investment target for businesses and how local companies can expand globally. Other events that local businesses participated in were \"Doing Business in Africa\" held on May 8, 2017, and \"Doing Business in Mexico and Canada\" held on May 26, 2017 at the New York City office of ESD. We allowed companies as well as ESD offices in those countries to skype into the meeting. Additionally, the LI region hosted an event on June 15, 2017 in Garden City where over 20 local companies that focus on military sales could learn about exporting to Israel. This event included representatives from ESD, the U.S. Commerce Department, and the Israel Defense Ministry. Other programs that our Region participated in include: Hannover Messe, China Import Expo, Canada Trade Mission, Smart Cities - Barcelona, Indonesia and Vietnam Trade Mission, Africa Health, China International Optoelectronic Expo, and the Lighting for Rail Conference in London. The programs held abroad, as well as locally here on Long Island and New York City, have helped companies on Long Island to expand their brand presence, increase business connections, and grow their business globally.50wHat we'Re doIng ...

Next Steps to encourage more LI companies to seek new global markets Although we've made progress since 2011 in encouraging exports, clearly there is more to do. More than 30 Long Island manufacturers have traveled to trade shows to explore global markets but this region has many more manufacturers with export potential. Our biggest challenge has been recruiting firms for trade shows. Our Global NY Work Group found that we lack a strong database of export-interested firms. One reason is that most small firms - the brunt of LI's economy - lack an \"export manager\" so finding the right contact has been challenging. Also, many trade shows are industry specific so our marketing and outreach needs to be more smartly focused. We have started to address this issue and in 2015 we committed to creating a dynamic database to list export-interested LI manufacturers. This year a brief export survey was emailed to over 300 manufacturers. Two trade groups emailed the same survey to their membership. The survey contained only a few simple questions: What products do you manufacture on Long Island? Do you currently export? What markets or countries are you interested in? Would you be interested in export assistance and or traveling with ESD to trade shows globally? Unfortunately, the response rate was significantly lower than we had hoped so we contacted every company for follow-up. We now have a small yet important database of about 25 new companies seeking help to export. Our goal is to continue adding to the survey. Now when we are recruiting for trade shows or export programs we can reach out and target manufacturers by products and/or countries of interest. A small step, yes - but one we committed to do in our Global NY implementation strategy and can build on. ESD and our global partners at U.S Commerce can do more export training right here on LI. The events on opportunities in Israel and South Africa were very useful. Convincing a CEO to come to Garden City is far easier than traveling to Tel Aviv or Johannesburg. These local events expose companies to new markets and cost them virtually nothing. And they sometimes can act as appetizers for companies that decide it's worth their time and money to travel overseas and meet customers and learn nuances of doing business in that country. We will try to encourage more of these programs on Long Island and offer our companies the opportunity to phone or Skype in when attendance is difficult. ESD has forged a strong relationship with our federal export partners at U.S Commerce and the SBA. In fact, the SBA helps fund much of NYS's Global Trade show reimbursement program - STEP . This region will also promote those opportunities to more non-traditional industries such as food production and agriculture. The world has become smaller and it is easier for our manufacturers to showcase their products globally. Decades of success in selling at home and abroad prove that we have the products the world wants. ESD's challenge is to make the right linkages between our makers and global markets. 52natuRaL assets and touRIsmwHat we'Re doIng ... A strong, sustainable tourist economy relies on protecting the environment, preserving historical sites, promoting farming and fishing, as well as ecological research, cultural and arts. Key Strategy: Produce a new generation of sustainable, well-paying jobs in the legacy sectors of agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries and tourism by enhancing the economic value of our parks, historic places, and arts venues and organizations, and expanding export opportunities, infrastructure, recreation facilities, research partnerships and workforce training. Key Strategy: Attract travelers from across the globe by leveraging Long Island's unique heritage and tourism assets to convey our rich contributions to American history, the arts, and culture. When it comes to growing Long Island's economy, the environment and economic development go hand-in-hand. You can't have vibrant new downtown apartments and offices, for instance, without sewers to protect drinking water. You can't move more goods from makers to markets without reducing congestion on our roadways. And you certainly can't have an appealing tourism industry if you don't have clean, beautiful beaches, or bucolic farms and other agricultural products that are magnets for visitors from crowded cities. That's why, from the beginning of its job-creating journey, the LIREDC fashioned work groups to consider strategies and projects for our multi-billion dollar tourism industry and for our \"natural assets\" - farming, fishing and environmental protection. Everybody hates to wait - for trains, cabs, food and especially for patient information in a hospital. Now, two hospitality students from St. Joseph's College are getting the chance to make life easier for people waiting to be updated about a loved one in surgery and other hospital situations. Using innovative practices they learned in the classroom, Michael DeCicco and Kaleigh Bednor were the first Northwell Health interns to focus on the marriage of hospitals and hospitality. They spent eight weeks of their summer at Huntington Hospital. The hope is that the program will be expanded to other hospitals in the giant health system and become a permanent feature of its approach to patient care. \"It can be a very stressful time waiting for updates on a patient in surgery,\" Kaleigh said of the traditional ambulatory waiting room. \"We're focusing on how we can tie hospitality elements into certain policies, procedures and areas of the hospital. My hope is that I can make even the smallest impact on any of the patients and their loved ones that I come in contact with.\" Due to join Kaleigh at the internship was fellow St. Joe's HTM major Michael DeCicco, who was already familiar with Northwell's Huntington Hospital location from work as a volunteer. After being accepted to Northwell's hospitality in healthcare program, Michael personality and work ethic earned him an unexpected second option. He was asked to become Huntington Hospital's new access control coordinator - an opportunity he gladly accepted. \"I'm one of the first impressions of the hospital, so it is extremely important to assure no one leaves with any questions or concerns,\" Michael said. \"I hold a big part in bringing a hospitable environment and assisting all visitors.\" A month into his employment, Michael is working with the director of patient and family experience to survey patients and seek ways to better their experience.hoSPitaL iNterNS MichaeL Decicco aND kaLeigh beDNor 53wHat we'Re doIng ... Tourism is a multi-billion dollar industry on Long Island, creating jobs, developing technology, attracting newcomers as potential residents and investors, and driving tax dollars to state and local coffers. Natural assets-related businesses are a complementary match for economic power. But the two together produce synergies that not only create jobs but give Long Island its essential character - a blend of old and new, high tech and legacy, innovative and historic. Over the past six years, the LIREDC has brought to life several projects that embody our core strategies with a focus on enhancing tradeable sectors, promoting placemaking through the arts, creating a thriving workforce, and further developing and supporting ecotourism initiatives with investments in infrastructure, technology, education and marketing. The enhancement of Long Island's rich agricultural, aquacultural and tourism heritage ensures that our natural resources are promoted and preserved for generations to come. We have diligently reviewed proposals from entrepreneurs and environmentalists and carefully selected projects that not only provide a source of jobs in their market but also protect our natural assets. Natural Assets As presented in the five-year strategic economic development plan produced in 2011, the LIREDC supports Natural Assets-related projects that improve employment opportunities in legacy sectors (agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries and tourism); that grow sustainable industries; that boost eco-tourism activities and the infrastructure and parks necessary to support them; and that avail themselves of innovative technology, especially those developed on Long Island. State investments in the following past (and future) projects embody these objectives, driving economic growth and environmental sustainability. Manna Fish Farms: By utilizing the latest submersible cage technologies, Manna Fish Farms will farm finfish, shellfish and macroalgae, while researching and developing integrated multitrophic aquaculture in the Atlantic. In addition to expanding Long Island's sustainable fishing industry, this project will produce a number of jobs through the operation of a hatchery, production of fish food, and the operation of the farm itself. To date Manna Fish Farms has refurbished an automated feed system and secured fingerlings from Cold Spring Harbor Hatchery in Oyster Bay. Farmers of the Future: Initiated in 2014 by the Peconic Land Trust with a LIREDC-supported grant , the Farmers of the Future program established a pool of financing to help full-time farmers make capital investments. The program reimburses farmers up to 20 precent of the purchase cost of new or used capital equipment. Eligible parties include: new and emerging farmers, farmers upgrading equipment to be in compliance with new food safety regulations, and farmers transitioning to new commodities or methods of production. Since its formal announcement in 2015, the Agriculture Capital Equipment Grant Program has received 42 applications. A total of $739,970 has been pre-approved and $256,709 reimbursed with 17 completed projects. 54wHat we'Re doIng ... Farmers of the Future recipients include: Amber Waves Farm: A women-owned farm in Amagansett, Amber Waves has grown from a single acre of vegetable production to ten acres for a Community Supported Agriculture program that itself started with 18 original members and morphed into 150. Amber Waves applied for the Farmers of the Future grant for equipment in order to increase efficiency and safety in the fields, expand agri-tourism, and food safety/ FSMA. They aspire to grow their apprenticeship program as well as agri-tourism in Amagansett and with the help of the grant they are on their way to doing so. Wolfer Estate Vineyards: Operating since 1988, this Sagaponack winery is the founding member of Long Island Sustainable Winemaking. They grow their own grapes to produce wine. Their customers drop in to have educational wine tastings, tour the vineyard, and learn about their history\u2014including how grapes are grown on Long Island, how wine is made, and the importance of being a sustainable vineyard. Wolfer applied for a Farmers of the Future grant to buy equipment that would allow them to expand their current business and enhance environmentally friendly practices. Cornell Oysters Inc. Located in Southold, Cornell Oyster farm has 30 acres on the water and has been selling oysters for 11 years. Due to such a high demand, they are expanding their business to culture more oyster seed. They sell to both wholesalers and restaurants on the North and South Forks. Cornell Oysters highlights the environmental sustainability of their product \u2014 oysters actually filter the water, making it cleaner for all organisms. The Farmers of the Future grant will help them create more supply to meet greater demand with updated and upgraded equipment. Looking Ahead As we move into another year of project selection, we continue to follow the core philosophy of balancing environmental protection with economic development. The two not only can go hand-in-hand, they must if Long Island is to preserve its natural assets and promote its economy. Natural Assets and Tourism are the foundation of our destination and will be integral to enhancing and increasing the economic development of our region. 55wHat we'Re doIng ... Greenport Aquaculture & Marine Center: Greenport is one of Long Island's top three ports bringing in a combined 16 million pounds of fish and shellfish annually. Oysters are currently ranked among the most valuable catch. The current state of the Greenport Yacht & Shipbuilding Co. property presents an opportunity to revitalize 4.3 acres of waterfront property in the heart of Greenport into a viable aquaculture business with oysters as the cornerstone but not its sole product. The property is already zoned for industrial and aquaculture needs and houses the only dry dock on Eastern Long Island. Through the preservation of this commercial waterfront property, fishermen and aquaculture farmers here can have a centralized processing and distribution facility that meets all DEC requirements. A portion of the 8,300 square foot building will contain 55-degree flowing salt water holding tanks to cleanse oysters and a 100 square foot walk-in refrigerator that can be sectioned off for individual businesses. To date the property houses the only dry dock capable of handling 50 ton and greater vessels in eastern New York State. The revitalization of this dock would increase business with inter- island ferries and commercial marine vessels. The revitalization would also preserve the building's marine history and provide additional tourist traffic to the waterfront which is a key part of the Island's tourism industry. This project would also account for an increase in local job opportunities for operation of the dry dock and marine center. Oysterponds Historical Society: By acquiring the Orient Methodist Church and Park, the historical society hopes to prevent the private sale and residential development of this significant historic property in the heart of Orient village. The Church, built in 1836, is at the center of the landmark Orient Historic District at the crossroads of Long Island and New England. Safeguarding this property from development will maintain vital public space, honor the building's role in the community's life, uphold the village's historic integrity and authenticity, and provide needed space for cultural and other programming. The Oysterponds Historical Society, or OHS, is a non-profit organization founded in 1944 that owns and maintains invaluable collections on a campus that includes seven historic buildings. Round Seven Priorty Projects: Natural Assets Several promising natural assets themed projects came before the council, projects that fit within the framework of our strategies for economic development and job creation. 56wHat we'Re doIng ... This project aligns with the REDC strategy of attracting travelers to Long Island's assets in history, arts, and culture and contributes to New York's Path Through History program. Orient is at the eastern tip of the North Fork, which people visit for its historic rural character as well as its beauty, vineyards, and working farms. North Fork Trolley Loop: In an effort to decrease traffic congestion during peak season on the North Fork as well as turn this popular Long Island destination into a walkable option for travelers, the North Fork T rolley project would operate September 1 through November 12 running from the Mattituck LIRR station to Peconic Lane and Southold station to Greenport. For $10 per day or $100 seasonal pass, visitors and locals would have easy access to key attractions, restaurants and local businesses with this safe and economical option. The North Fork T rolley pilot program is slated to launch fall 2017 with two 30-person trolleys. T rolley service is complimentary during the launch weekend. 57Tourism The tourism industry on Long Island generates $5.6 billion in annual visitor spending, accounting for over 100,000 jobs and placing Long Island as a statewide leader behind New York City. Long Island welcomes over 9 million visitors each year from across the globe to enjoy our natural assets such as our parks and beaches as well as the many accommodations, restaurants and attractions we have to offer. Very rarely does an industry deliver such significant return on investment that directly impacts a region's economic development thus making the tourism industry such a vital asset. The Path Through History, Arts and Tourism initiative and its destination branding and development has breathed new life into the way visitors view our natural assets, historical relevance, and new features such as craft beverage trails. The following projects are among a number that have continued to increase awareness and visibility of Long Island on a global scale. Path Through History: New York State bestowed a special designation to Long Island's Route 25A, a 50- mile stretch from Great Neck to Port Jefferson that was used by the Culper Spy Ring during the Revolutionary War. Now officially designated the Washington Spy Trail, the route boasts more than two dozen spy ring signs highlighting its historical significance to visitors and the community. Considered the nation's first espionage group, the Culper Spy Ring used the route to slip through British lines and deliver secret messages to General George Washington to turn the tide of the war. This project continues to elevate awareness of Long island's dedication to the I LOVE NY \"Path Through History\" program, attracting travelers from across the globe by leveraging our unique heritage and tourism assets through American history, arts and culture. The Path initiative continues to directly drive tourism with over 46 projects that have supported the key strategies set forth by both the Natural Asset and 'Path Through History' work groups. Pride on the Beach: Recipients of a 2016 $300,000 Market NY Grant, the LGBT Network partnered with the City of Long Beach to produce a 3-day \"destination event\" that leveraged Long Island's beaches as a natural tourism asset to stimulate out-of-state tourism. The City of Long Beach welcomed over 20,000 people to join the 27th annual celebration in its new location with visitors from across 15 states as well as Canada. The visitors - many first-time visitors to Long Island - not only experienced a fun, festive celebration of gay culture and families, but saw in the city's surf, sand, boardwalk and other amenities a great reason to return. wHat we'Re doIng ... DaviD kiLMNick aND robert viteLLi Lgbt N etWork Founded on Long Island, the LGBT Network is the nation's premier suburban voice for lesbian, gay, bisexual or transsexual rights. But the impact of its inclusive and innovative approach to LGBT issues has benefitted our collective consciousness and economy. At the center of the organization's projects - several of which have been supported by the LIREDC - is a dynamic and creative married couple, David Kilmnick and Robert Vitelli. They are working for all of us. On August 17, for instance, the LGBT Network unveiled plans for a 75-unit affordable housing apartment complex for senior citizens identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transsexual, as well as those who are LGBT-friendly. The project will advance the revival of Bay Shore and smart- growth, TOD strategies. The announcement follows by two months a smashingly successful \"Pride on the Beach\" weekend that drew tens of thousands of people to Long Beach - many experiencing Long Island for the first time - and generated millions of dollars in economic activity. The City of Long Beach was so delighted that it urged the Network to return next year - hopefully receiving state funds again, as the LIREDC has recommended. \"We are utilizing the natural assets of Long Island's beaches to drive tourism, tolerance and economic development,\" said Robert. \"And a lot of fun!\" Through their hard work, David and Robert and their team have broken down barriers and brought many people, gay and straight alike, together. \"The sense of acceptance was evident in dozens of businesses and residents displaying rainbow flags,\" said David. \"More than 100 groups marched in the parade, including, for the first time ever, police departments, fire departments, Boy Scouts, schools and groups from all five boroughs. \"People of all ages, families with young children, grandparents all cheered and waved rainbow flags,\" added Robert. \"You could hear up and down the route people saying, 'Thank you, we need you here.' This solidarity was a sign of how far we've come.\" And how great it was for business, now and into the future. 58wHat we'Re doIng ... Long Island Welcome Center and Taste NY Market: The grand opening of the new Long Island Welcome Center between exits 51-52 eastbound on the Long Island Expressway connects visitors with Long Island's historical and recreational opportunities. The 15,200 square foot Welcome Center includes a Taste NY Market promoting locally grown, New York-made products and supports regional tourism. The spacious, LEED-certified visitor's center provides numerous amenities for travelers, including a community room with a DMV kiosk and innovative travel features from I LOVE NEW YORK that highlight Long Island's diverse tourism attractions. In the event of a storm or catastrophic event, the community room can serve as a safe refuge for travelers and residents. The Taste NY Market showcases a broad selection of fresh made breakfast and lunch items, including soups, salads, sandwiches and desserts using ingredients sourced from Long Island and state growers. It also offers grab-and-go snacks and specialty local items for sale, providing an opportunity for local producers to market their products. In addition to the Taste NY Market, the Welcome Center will be the home to an outdoor farmers' market open Saturdays and Sundays through the season. It will provide locally-grown and produced foods to visitors, spotlighting Long Island farms and encouraging agri-tourism throughout the region. Long Island Craft Beverage Trail: Long Island's craft beverage scene is booming with over 70 vineyards and breweries that are utilizing locally-grown ingredients. Rated by Wine Enthusiast as one of the 'Top 10 Wine Regions' in the world, our varietals and lively brew scene are attractions in and of themselves with locations scattered across Long Island's north and south shores. The craft beverage project directly impacts the local economy through job creation and the commerce of locally sourced products, and has created a unique niche within our state's agricultural sector. US Synchronized Swimming 2017 America Open: The Synchro America Open is an elite international event where Olympians, World Champions and future Olympians compete on the world stage for the 6th and next- to-last leg of the FINA Synchronized Swimming World Series. Held at the Nassau County Aquatics Center in June 2017 the 4-day event hosted 110 athletes from 17 different countries with over 1,000 attendees. Olympic Day activities featured athlete appearances and autograph sessions, live entertainment and an all-women's Acapella group. 118th US Open Golf Championships: In conjunction with the USGA, Long Island will be hosting the 118th US Open Golf Championships at Shinnecock Golf Course in Southampton June 10-17, 2018. Over 25,000 visitors are expected to attend the event while millions tune in from the globe. The LIREDC is especially proud of its efforts in the realm of Natural Assets and Tourism, one of our most active and inventive work groups. Its determined balancing of environmental protection and economic development, as well as its recognition of how important the past is to our future, makes its work particularly emblematic of our vision and values. We hope this is evident in these examples of our choices for a new round of funding in 2018. 59wHat we'Re doIng ... Round Seven Priority Projects: Tourism Discover Long Island and New York City. Collaboration has not been limited just to Long Island organizations and communities. Discover Long Island will use funds from this grant to fulfill the goals of Governor Andrew Cuomo's initiative to generate awareness of our region among the millions of tourists welcomed by New York City annually. Discover Long Island and NYC & CO have established a formal cooperative partnership to promote Long Island as a NYC+ destination in two proven visitor source markets for New York State - Australia and Canada. Recent travel statistics show that people from these two international markets spend up to 14 days of their vacation time in New York City annually and our goal is to increase overall awareness of Long Island and its proximity to NYC in the hopes of attracting them to the bi-county region. Craft Beverage Bonanza. The East End Tourism Alliance will produce and promote a series of thematic weekend events that cross-market our craft beverages/local farming with other important cultural/tourism assets in the region. Each weekend promotion will thus focus on a specific theme art, literature, history and of course music -- in craft beverage tasting rooms and other venues to attract aficionados of each genre to the region. Because a primary objective of EETA is to generate visitor traffic in the off season, the promotional weekends will take place outside of peak tourism periods. And because our agriculture, aquaculture and farm-based beverage industries offer seasonal specialties throughout the year, the initiative will schedule weekends to correspond with the availability of local products paired with our craft beverages. After years of using music, art and other cultural activities to promote craft beverage sales, this project will reverse the formula. Young and In Love... with Wine. The Long Island Wine Council proposes an innovative marketing plan designed to capture the growing domestic and international Enotourism market, with special focus on Millennials who have become the most influential demographic within wine, food and travel. The proposal identifies two major tactics that will help increase year-round tourism to the eastern end of Long Island. One is a partnership with a top public relations agency that will establish strong relationships with the influencers such as sommeliers, retailers, and food/wine/travel writers. The other is the creation of educational wine events for consumers. All efforts will be supported through creative social media campaigns to ensure each initiative achieves maximum reach with our target audience. The project will lead to an increase in awareness of Long Island Wine Country that will translate into increased placements on NYC - and local wine lists, increased presence at key NYC-based retailers and an increase in Enotourism - visitors to the East End. Tough Mudder, an organization that stages unusual races through mud and 60wHat we'Re doIng ... other obstacles, will build on a successful 2017 event that attracted 11,500 people to its Long Island location. Tough Mudder Long Island 2018 will tentatively be held on July 21-22, 2018, at Old Bethpage Village Restoration in Old Bethpage. This event will feature the signature Tough Mudder events of varying lengths. Each course will feature over 20 obstacles, as well as scenic trail routes and challenging course terrain unique to the TM event series. Additionally, the event will feature exciting activities for spectators. TM is confident that attendance will exceed 14,500 in 2018. The investments in this event will deliver significant benefits beyond the weekend by attracting people from beyond the region, enhancing Long Island's reputation as a leading tourism destination. Arts Rising From the Ashes. On December 16, 2016, the iconic Sag Harbor Cinema (SHC) burned in a fire that damaged several buildings on the Village's Main Street. The SHC is the only movie theatre playing documentary, independent and foreign films on Long Island's East End. Historically significant, SHC was built over 100 years ago from an art deco design by renowned architect John Eberson. The Sag Harbor Partnership (SHP), a community-based not- for-profit, will use grant funds to purchase the building and to rebuild the theatre. The partnership has raised almost $5 million to date. Once complete, the SHC will include a 250-seat main theater, running first-run independent, documentary and foreign films, and Hollywood productions that appeal to new audiences and underserved markets; a 120-seat repertory screening room for series, tributes and retrospectives focused on a particular filmmaker, theme, genre or time period; and a 30-seat screening room used for flexible community programming, longer run premiers and can be rented for private screenings, a much sought after outlet on the East End. Making LI's Biggest and Best Even Better. Long Island University's Tilles Center for the Performing Arts is our region's premier cultural arts venue but it has a potential to grow in its leadership and job-creation role. This project, the Tilles Center Plaza Expansion and Upgrades, will create a large, outdoor space adjacent to the main facility that can be used for additional events, including private parties that can bring in revenue to support arts programming. It also will aid in refurbishing the interior. Located on Northern Boulevard, the main commercial artery of Long Island's North Shore, the 35,000 square foot plaza will provide a flexible space for the 100 - plus community organizations that currently partner with Tilles Center, as well as outdoor performances, world-class festivals celebrating the arts and culture of Long Island, and other events. The project will also enhance the patron and artist experience inside Tilles Center by replacing the seats and carpeting and installing an automated curtain package in the concert hall. 61wHat we'Re doIng ... Food Cluster Long Island's legacy agricultural and fishing enterprises are evolving into a modern, multi- faceted and money-making industry creating tradeable products and opportunities for entrepreneurs and eaters within and beyond our borders. From its earliest history, even during the pre-Colonial days when Native Americans dominated the landscape, food was big business on Long Island. As the region grew and found industrial success in the 20th Century around things that flew rather than grew, farming and fishing remained key economic drivers. Whether it was the Long Island Duck, the Blue Point Oyster, or fields of potatoes and cauliflower, the region provided food for local consumption and export. These food businesses also created many jobs, and still do. But now the products are more likely to be grapes and wine and increasing varieties of finfish, seafood and organic greens for restaurants in Nassau- Suffolk and beyond. Output and profitability are rising as well, on the strength of smarter and tech-assisted production processes. The LIREDC has strongly supported these advances with investments that realize key goals and strategies in everything from invigorating legacy industries to encouraging exports and the arrival of new companies. The burgeoning food cluster on Long Island continues to grow, even in the headwinds of a changing marketplace. The food industry nationally is evolving and conventional supermarkets and their distribution channels are changing as consumers demand more variety and better quality of product as well as instant delivery. Changing tastes have given rise to more, and bigger, ethnic food processors and distributors. Long Island food companies - some of which started in home kitchens and basements - continue to innovate, attract investment and modernize production to meet these challenges. The food cluster on LI has added over 350 jobs since 2011. On Long Island, food and foodies rule! We are becoming a magnet for food producers, an important LIREDC goal in encouraging a Food cluster. This past year some Long Island food firms have been purchased by out-of-state firms, including Kitchen Table Bakers of Farmingdale, and United Baking in Shirley. But these companies are not leaving, as many often do in other industry sectors when they are purchased by out-of-towners. Despite new ownership these companies are continuing to invest and grow - and add jobs - on Long Island. The acquiring businesses recognize not only the value in these purchases but, more importantly, the region's attractiveness as a food cluster. They see the region's taste and tenacity for improving production and profits through innovation, tradition of excellence, and the well-trained workforce. The region looks more eagerly than anxiously at the new ownership for the fresh investment, ideas and energy it can bring. Whether the acquirer hails from a neighboring state or from Canada, the LIREDC believes the \"new blood\" is an opportunity for our food cluster to reach more and more customers with better and better products. What will be the next Long Island Duck? We don't know for sure but we can't wait to find out - and to share a big plate with the world! 62wHat we'Re doIng ... Tastes they are a-changing One of the great social and economic stories of this new Century is the dynamic demographic change in suburbia. As places like Long Island become more and more diverse, with huge increases in Hispanic, Asian and other immigrant families, the quantity and quality of food reflecting these cultures has grown as well. This diversification shows up most visibly in restaurants offering more exotic fare. The rising demand for ethnic food in the region and nationally also has leavened a growing number of manufacturers like Quesos La Ricura in Hicksville, which makes specialty cheeses and dairy products aimed at the Hispanic marketplace; La Flor Spices in Hicksville; and Gabila's in Copiague, which manufactures their well- known line of potato knishes including the \"classic Coney Island square knish.\" Soon a large and rapidly growing Queens based Chinese specialty food manufacturer will invest over $10 million in a new Long Island plant and bring nearly 200 jobs to our region. These ethnic product makers and distributors specializing in ethnic olive oils, cheeses, vegetables, spices and other food stuffs serve a growing market. This intriguing subset of our food cluster is meeting the needs of ethnic customers not just on Long Island but throughout the U.S. Some of these businesses have moved to Long Island as space in NYC has become scarce. These \"food-preneurs\" have the ideas and contacts and know how to find the manufacturing space or contract packers to get their goods on store shelves. Long Island's cluster has created the infrastructure that is attractive to these new companies, and NYS has a myriad of financial incentives to help them thrive here. Long Island's focus on food is leveraged by a highly successful \"Taste of New York\" tourism initiative; companies understand the value of aligning with the program. Local stores and even a newly opened Long Island Visitors Welcome Center on the Long Island Expressway offer travel- weary consumers the opportunity to relax while tasting cheeses and dairy products from upstate New York or yogurt from Long Island. And more than a few of the customers are locals. Supplying the Suppliers The supply chain that supports our food cluster is expanding as well. The manufacturers and distributors of packaging, supplies and cartons typically seek to be near food companies and often receive help from NYS. Several cold storage facilities have opened on Long Island offering energy efficient space for the many cold and frozen food manufacturers in the region. Reasonably priced refrigeration and frozen food space is still critically important and supported by the LIREDC, including a facility in Riverhead funded in 2011 called Agri-Park. Critical Mass of Support for Start Ups The region has been successful in creating the necessary infrastructure to support the food cluster ecosystem including NYS funds to build the highly successful Calverton/Riverhead Food Incubator operated by Stony Brook University. Over 50 companies on the East End have 24-hour access to the SBU facility along with mentoring and university linkages. Part of the SBU incubator is the Agriculture Consumer Science Center completed in 2012 as the site of the region's only NY State food processing facility for startups. It is a fully equipped commercial kitchen with over 3,000 square feet of cooking space for qualified applicants. The facility includes a gluten-free kitchen, a baking kitchen and two \"hot process\" lines. The ACSC provides regional wine and food producers, as well as local entrepreneurs, access to shared processing areas. 63wHat we'Re doIng ... Tenants can take full advantage of vast resources to accelerate the research and development of products and/or services for introduction into the marketplace, as well as utilize New York State Small Business Development Center Advisors who can guide and offer advice from concept to commercialization. As a shared-use, small-scale food processing center with 24/7 access, the ACSC allows farmers to add value to their agricultural commodities, gives community food businesses the opportunity to expand into new lines, and helps potential food entrepreneurs to start new businesses. It offers farmers, start-ups and expanding businesses the opportunity to explore retail food production without the high cost of equipment or manufacturing space, and also provides much-needed technical assistance in food production and general business management education. Currently, the ACSC has over 50 active users including Peconic Escargot (the only fresh escargot in the Northeast), Divine Brine (pickles), North Fork Chocolate , Subtle Tea and many other small producers hoping to grow from niche markets to more mainstream customers nationally. The Stony Brook food incubator boasts some fascinating stories like Copia Granola where Grace Marie Longinetti manufactures gluten free all natural non-GMO energy bars. Grace started in 2015 with an intern and no distribution and now has grown to fourteen accounts, four paid employees and two interns and locations in two \"Taste of New York\" locations across NYS. There are many similar success stories in LI's incubators, home garages and borrowed commercial kitchens across LI. Our goal is to coax these budding entrepreneurs out of their home kitchens and incubators and help them access low-cost capital, mentoring and state and local programs to grow. We hope to duplicate the success of the Calverton Food Incubator miles away in Nassau County where the region's newest food incubator is being outfitted in Old Bethpage and run by Nassau County Parks with a $200,000 LIREDC award. That project has issued a RFP to select a capable entity to run the new facility. The food incubator, which will tap Cornell Co-op food technology experts for mentoring and training, is expected to open in early 2018 and is anticipated to be the home of many fledgling foodies. With food incubators in both counties, the needed mentoring, support and training resources and an abundance of food manufacturing buildings available, the region's food cluster seems healthy and the prospects for continued expansion look good. The food cluster's blend of tradition and technology, its re-invigoration of a legacy industry through innovation, makes it the perfect example of what the LIREDC is trying to accomplish by bringing together sectors, companies and people around strategies for economic growth. 64wHat we'Re doIng ... Opportunity Agenda The aspirations and accomplishments of our Opportunity Agenda continue to grow in Wyandanch and beyond, holistically revitalizing places and renewing people as a key inclusive strategy for economic growth. Economic development cannot be successful unless its benefits are distributed fairly among people and places. From the first meeting of the Council and its work groups, that powerful premise has guided the creation and implementation of our Strategic Plan. As a result, we built equity criteria into project scoring in Round One, and when the state directed its councils to identify communities for concentrated reinvestment, in Round Three we selected Wyandanch - a high- need area where civic groups, local government, and businesses were poised and ready for redevelopment. Residents expressed their priorities through a series of community meetings and through the ongoing participation of several stakeholders in the council's Opportunity Agenda Work Group. Although excited by the prospect of investment, especially in leveraging its existing Long Island Rail Road station with TOD development, Wyandanch stakeholders stressed the need for programmatic funding to ensure that long- time residents were more than mere corollary beneficiaries. The \"rising\" had to be about more than beautiful new buildings. Thus, the LIREDC has stressed and ensured that the creation of new residential and commercial space goes hand in hand with initiatives for job training, recreation, and social services. The development of Wyandanch Rising continues to transform the community, as the apartments in Buildings A and B are now occupied, along with an active outdoor plaza and retail in most of the storefronts. Last fall, the Albanese Corporation and the Community Development Corporation of Long Island started design on middle/mixed-income housing (Building E) and received a nine percent low income housing tax credit. The growing development will also host the Town of Babylon's Wyandanch Resource Center, a pillar of the area's economic development that provides a one-stop shop for job training and services. The center refers clients to several other Regional Council Award recipients, including programs such as the United Way of Long Island's VetsBuild and SNAP Opportunities program, which have trained 80 veterans and 60 youth in sustainable construction over multiple rounds. Key Strategy: Revitalize Long Island' s poorest places by targeting the region' s collective resources on new community-driven initiatives that can create jobs, homes and businesses and ensure that all communities are fully participating in the state' s economic revitalization. Sharon Cooper doesn't mince words. \"I was on social services because I was a drug addict, in and out of trouble,\" Sharon said. \"I was a crack head, plain and simple.\" Now, thanks to an LIREDC-supported workforce training program that prepares unemployed community members to benefit from the Opportunity Agenda revival in Wyandanch, Sharon, at 58, has become a productive role- model. \"It's much better being an inspiration to my family and friends than a burden,\" she says. \"It's great being a part of society.\" \"Sharon's life began to turn around a few years back when she spent 10 months \"getting clean in a residential drug treatment center.\" Then she was directed to the Wyandanch Resource Center, which was set up by Babylon Town and Suffolk County in the shadow of a massive redevelopment at the Wyandanch Long Island Rail Road station. The Center has helped scores of Wyandanch-area residents receive workforce training, including \"soft\" or social skills that can improve the chance of success. Some of them, whose stories have been highlighted in prior LIREDC reports, became members of building trades unions and gained the ability to find work beyond the Wyandanch project. Sharon so impressed Resource Center officials with her work ethic that they hired her to work at the Center itself. \"I was a little janitor,\" she says laughing. \"Not a custodial engineer, just a janitor.\" But after two years, Sharon was ready to fly outside the elaborate trailer by the tracks. Right outside: She was hired by All Pro Parking to be an enforcement agent at the Wyandanch and Mineola commuter garages. So now that she is off social services and working full time, how is Sharon doing? She was too humble to say herself, but according to Beverly Theodore, the talented and dedicated director of the Resource Center, Sharon was just named All Pro Parking Employee of the Month. And she is good at her job: Just try parking illegally in Wyandanch and Mineola, and you just might find out how good.SharoN cooP er WyaNDaNch reSource ceNter 65wHat we'Re doIng ... Round Seven Priority Projects: Opportunity Agenda This year, we propose several priority projects aimed at advancing the Opportunity Agenda, and further developing a cohesive system of affordable housing, job training, and community amenities: The YMCA of Long Island is partnering with the Albanese Organization to build a 47,000 square foot facility in Wyandanch Plaza's Building D, which will complete Phase I of the Plaza. This facility's classrooms and recreational space will develop the untapped potential of children and teens by providing early and school-age child care and day camp in cooperation with the Wyandanch School District, as well as Achievement Gap programming, pre-teen/teen centers, and teen job training. Teens will benefit from mentor support that will address gang violence, drug abuse, and other high-risk behaviors. The YMCA will also support chronic disease prevention and recovery in partnership with HRH Care, including evidenced-based programs for diabetes prevention, youth obesity prevention, fall prevention, cancer recovery, and fitness for those with arthritis. This Y is a vital amenity for the entire community and will stimulate growth by driving retail and foot traffic to the area, as it has in communities such as Bay Shore and Patchogue. The Y anticipates creating 12 full-time and 75 part-time seasonal jobs, and recruiting employees locally. Digital Ball Park a partnership between Suffolk County, LISTnet (Long Island Software Technology Network) and the Urban League of Long Island , plan to create a technology- focused incubator, and co- working, and event space in a retail storefront in the Wyandanch Village development. By building this facility in the Wyandanch TOD, with its easy access to and from New York City by rail, the 110 Corridor, and the local downtown, the incubator will give new and growing businesses the visibility and flexibility they need, while contributing to the equity goals of the LIREDC. Grant funding for this project will support construction and space fit-out costs for the construction of ten to thirteen individual offices, as well as a reception/conference area for networking events. Now at Dartmouth, Pablo says his rise from troubled Hempstead High School to an elite college was fueled by the dreams of his immigrant parents, an inspiring chemistry teacher and the Medical Scholars Pipeline, a program of the Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra / Northwell. \"A lot of people were willing to settle for just graduating high school, but I have always wanted more than that,\" said Pablo, who was accepted to seven of the nation's top 20 schools and was the first of his family to attend college. \"The Pipeline Program helped to show me that there was more.\" A Hofstra/Northwell awardee through the LIREDC process, the Hofstra/Northwell Pipeline has propelled dozens of students from underserved communities to immerse themselves, in health care sciences and meet many impressive professionals, as well as high-flying peers, to serve as friends, mentors and role models.

The program will target unemployed / dislocated workers and special populations - including those not college-bound in the near term - addressing skills gaps, poverty, and unemployment in a high-needs community. The program will support the worker talent pipeline in distressed communities. Viability, Inc. proposes a skills development training program that will be hosted on site by Walgreens retail stores. The training will be divided into three weeks of paid, interactive training, during which trainees will put the retail skills they learn into practice on the sales floor. T rainees who successfully complete the program will be eligible for hire in Walgreens stores. T rainees will have a tool kit of transferable and soft skills that are relevant not only to retail, but to a wide variety of alternative industries. The multi-faceted efforts in Wyandanch have melded elements of innovation, infrastructure, workforce training, natural assets and other regional priorities examines by our work groups.

We don't expect Huntington Station to be the last of these holistic initiatives nor will we abandon Wyandanch in moving beyond.wHat we'Re doIng ... 67Bring Workforce and Education stakeholders together to develop cohesive training programs and job pathwaysBy encouraging collaborations with our partners at BOCES, regional high schools and secondary schools this year we were able to create partnerships to develop impactful training projects to train our existing and future workforce.

Part Four: Participation Work Group Descriptions Our work groups are at the core of our efforts to reach out to as many Long Islanders as possible and to develop an inclusive, \"bottom up\" approach for truly regional transformative economic change. Literally hundreds of people are members of the work groups and the countless hours they collectively devote to their tasks - including participation in community outreach - has driven our success. The LIREDC has five active work groups, including a broad range of both public and private stakeholders. These volunteers lend their time and expertise to the LIREDC. Through their public outreach efforts they entice potential applicants to bring their projects before the council; they vet these projects against our regional strategies and help to identify those priority projects that keep a robust pipeline towards implementing both state and regional strategies. Innovation, Industry Cluster and Global NY Work Group The Innovation and Industry Cluster Work Group is comprised of leadership from the region's premier universities and research institutions as well as local businesses and economic development agencies. Two years ago this group identified biotechnology as the region's industry cluster and developed specific strategies to foster that industry. The work group continues to identify, shape and support projects that align with regional strategies for technology commercialization. Since collaboration within and between work groups is encouraged, in 2016 the Global NY work group was merged into the Innovation and Industry Cluster work group to further identify strategies and support projects to boost Long Island exports and increase foreign direct investment. Infrastructure More than 30 professionals from various backgrounds continue their dedicated work towards developing infrastructure projects essential to growth. The infrastructure strategies established at the outset of the REDC process continue to guide their actions through each CFA round. Project initiatives for revitalizing downtowns, while upgrading our infrastructure, have ensured our region's placemaking. In 2017, the work group focused on support of downtown revitalization initiatives with an emphasis on sustainable infrastructure. Workforce Development and Veterans Work Group The Workforce Development work group worked intensely this year to survey industry partners to identify \"real world\" skill gaps in our emerging workforce and to survey and inventory existing training programs in order to develop new strategies to support the region's workforce development initiatives. This is one of our larger and most active groups consisting of representatives from government, business, industry, and conventional and non-conventional educational environments. This group met multiple times, both as a whole and in sector-based subcommittees, to support the work of the Regional Council with the creation of both training and educational programs for civilians and veterans to meet the demands of business and industry. 90wHat we'Re doIng ... Natural Assets and Tourism Work Group The Natural Assets and Tourism Work Group is comprised of a broad mix of individuals well-versed in the region's agriculture, aquaculture, arts, and tourism sectors. Since 2011, the group has developed strategies to enhance the economic potential of our Natural Assets. The group, which was very direct about reminding the broader council of the sector's importance, is committed to Long Island's historic agricultural tradition through sustainable growth in the Island's food, fish and beverage industries. The group focused on projects that increase the economic potential of our Natural Assets exports and year round tourism in the Long Island Region. Opportunity Agenda Work Group The Opportunity Agenda Work Group continues to analyze and focus on the needs of the economically distressed community of Wyandanch along with Huntington Station and has expanded their outreach efforts to encourage other distressed communities to ensure inclusive economic development policies are replicated island wide. Writers Work Group The Writers Work Group consists of a dedicated staff of individuals who are embedded in our work groups and whose knowledge of Long Island and ties to the community - as well as their writing ability - allows them to weave the narrative and analytic tale of our regional progress and our promise. Our story could not be told with such aspirational eloquence and expertise without these individuals who give so much of their time and talent. 91woRK gRoup membe Rs ...

The Downtown Revitalization Initiative Round Two provided another excellent opportunity for engaging our local public officials in the REDC process. To guarantee that the region was well represented in the competition, every elected town supervisor and mayor received written communication from the Long Island Regional Office of Empire State Development. This communication was by regular mail and email with weekly reminders encouraging all to submit an application . Furthermore, outreach was made to the Village Officials' Associations for both counties in the region. Finally, during the many public events and speaking engagement slisted below, the DRI was discusse d and all in attendance were encouraged to apply.

We are happy to report that our public outreach, including these \"open house\" sessions along with our two CFA Workshops and four public Regional Council meetings and with other speaking engagements, resulted in direct communication with over 5,000 individuals. The list in Appendix Three outlines these efforts.

Part Five: Downtown Revitalization Plan fraNceSca carLoW PreSiDeNt of NaSSau couNciL chaMberS of coMMerce The LIREDC recognized early on that vibrant downtowns were crucial to the economic vitality of the region. Our very first strategic plan emphasized the need to create walkable communities around Long Island Rail Road stations, exciting places with attractive but affordable apartments that appealed to young people who didn't want to buy a traditional single-family suburban home, and older people who no longer wanted to own one. The LIREDC understood that the regional economy needed to retain Millennials for their potential and Baby Boomers for their prosperity, and that we also wanted the new businesses - the restaurants, theaters, retail shops - that cluster in these \"denser,\" more culturally diverse downtowns. With so little space available or appropriate for development, existing downtowns offered opportunities for growth that would otherwise elude the region, and with it the jobs and tax revenue that provides local services. Not every village wanted such development, but more and more did as their leadership saw the transformative impact of smart growth in places like Patchogue, Huntington, Rockville Centre and Long Beach. That's why, from day one, the LIREDC has supported many projects to revitalize existing village centers or even create entire new neighborhoods in communities where the residents desired them. And that is why last year we so enthusiastically embraced Governor Cuomo's Downtown Revitalization Initiative (DRI), which led to our choice of the Village of Westbury for the first $10 million grant. So after seeing how Westbury's residents came together with a surge of civic pride and effort, it should come as no surprise how excited we were that another Long Island community would be eligible for a transformative award. And after an exhaustive process that saw 20 worthy proposals from one end of the region to the other, the LIREDC recommended the hamlet of Hicksville for this year's DRI. Hicksville is ready for transformative change. For decades regional planners and even many residents saw Hicksville's potential as an economic and cultural powerhouse. But for a variety of reasons, including a fear of diversity in everything from people to housing stock, Hicksville's potential remained unrealized. Now, its new leadership spurred on by committed \"Our choice for DRI was supported by many organizations and individuals not only in Hicksville but throughout the region, part of the catalytic impact of the LIREDC on placemaking and other economic development initiatives. Here is one of many letters of support we received, this one from Francesca Carlow, President of the Nassau Council of Chambers of Commerce: \"The hamlet of Hicksville located in the Town of Oyster Bay is the busiest LIRR train station and transportation hub on Long Island. Thousands of business commuters, families and tourists travel through Hicksville daily. Because of this rapid transit growth, the character of Hicksville's streets and downtown business community has declined and today the once bustling center of town is littered with empty store fronts and shuttered businesses. \"The Nassau Council of Chambers of Commerce representing over 10,000 businesses strongly supports the [Town's] pursuit of funding through the Downtown Revitalization Initiative to be invested into the downtown Hicksville area. \"The Hicksville project would have a significant economic impact on the immediate downtown as well as many surrounding towns. The convenience of the LIRR and easy access to New York City makes Hicksville a viable location for our next generation professionals to live, work and play. Many businesses complain that they cannot attract young talent to work on Long Island because of the lack of housing options. Hicksville could easily fill this void and bring back a once thriving sense of community. Hicksville is large enough to support and step into becoming an area for emerging industries and mixed-use opportunities. The NCCC encourages these initiatives and urges the Long Island Regional Economic Development Council to support the Hicksville Revitalization Project.\" 96wHat we'Re doIng ... civic and business organizations - has exciting ideas for connecting a chock-a-block downtown with innovative features that encourage people to make better use of its LIRR station and spend more time - willingly - walking from neighborhood to neighborhood. The town now recognizes that the thousands of Asians and other minorities living and working in the hamlet - which has become a center for Indian-American life on Long Island - is to be embraced as a strength. Nominated by the Town of Oyster Bay, which had been reticent to adopt smart growth, transit oriented principles, Hicksville rose to the top of the pile of applicants because of its potential impact not only on the 162 acres in the Central Business District but beyond to neighboring communities. \"Hicksville, which is our neighbor immediately to the west, is a vital crossroads for our community,\" said Elan Wurtzel, president of the Plainview- Old Bethpage Chamber of Commerce in support of the DRI proposal. \"We share many of the same concerns that Hicksville does [for a] vibrant business community, affordable housing, smart growth, good transportation access... and the ability to attract new and young families to the area.\" Of the many reasons for choosing Hicksville, the most important may have been the primacy of its LIRR station. Hicksville is the busiest on Long Island with 22,000 daily riders and the State has already commenced a $121 million refurbishment. Hicksville is also the beginning and end of the Third Track. This multi-billion dollar project will add a track from Hicksville to Floral Park, dramatically improving and expanding service by increasing frequency, decreasing delays and easing the trauma of commuting. There are also several development opportunities adjacent to and near the station for the creation of transit-oriented multifamily housing. One feature of the proposal that caught our eye was an imaginative and useful \"high line.\" Obviously borrowed from an incredibly popular feature of a famous New York City revitalization, the Hicksville version doesn't involve the transformation of track bed into a beautiful walkway with gardens and performance spaces. But it does align closely with the LIRR tracks to create an elevated pedestrian trail across parking garage rooftops and other elevated structures. The Hicksville High Line has the potential to become a suburban icon that can create its own synergies for pedestrians and private businesses. 97wHat we'Re doIng ... Hicksville has many assets that make it perfectly situated to maximize this $10 million infusion into the downtown center. In addition to the train station, Hicksville has several large parcels that are ripe for development, is conveniently situated near major highways, has several large and growing companies, is near three of the region's colleges, and has a richly diverse community that itself has become an attraction for new residents and visitors. Indian publications have noted the appeal for this growing ethnic group. \"We have a good quality of life here,\" Subodh Batra, an engineer, told Newsday. Subodh moved to LI from New Delhi 18 years ago, ultimately settling in Hicksville. More than 10,000 revelers joined a parade through Hicksville to celebrate Diwali, an Indian religious event. And the success for the Indian community has persuaded other new immigrant groups to choose Hicksville. After years of community meetings and consensus building, the Hamlet knows what it wants and is determined to see its vision become reality. Community support and planning efforts led the Town's new leadership to create a new zoning code that permitted higher density housing in the downtown and endorsed additional parking garages to bring people to the community yet keep their cars off the street once they got there. \"Our membership and community stakeholders have worked diligently over the past seven years to bring awareness and understanding of the need to revitalize downtown Hicksville,\" said Lionel Chitty, the tireless president of the Hicksville Chamber of Commerce. \"The planning process involved developing strategies to revitalize our downtown into a safe, attractive, walkable and vibrant downtown.\" One main concern that emerged from the \"visioning\" - which a robust local chamber of commerce supported - is the lack of public areas where the community can gather, thus, the central focus of the plan is to create such spaces that will give the community a sense of place. That's what made the High Line idea so appealing - creating a space that the people want and where they want it, through a process that they controlled. And that's why Hicksville was this year's winner. As Governor Cuomo said in announcing the Hicksville DRI, joined by Oyster Bay Town Supervisor Joe Saladino and Nassau County Executive Ed Mangano, the hamlet is ready to lead Long Island into a new era of prosperity. 98Appendix One CFA # Applicant Project Name Agency and Program Award Amount Total Project Cost Grant Disbursement to Date Status 14238 Community Housing Innovations, Inc.Long Island Homeownership 2011HCR - Affordable Home Ownership Development Program (AHC)640,000 $ 4,400,000 $ 640,000 $ Blue 14237 Long Island Housing Partnership Employer Assisted HousingHCR - Affordable Home Ownership Development Program (AHC)1,750,000 $ 23,622,000 $ 1,749,600 $ Blue 2277 Catalina Instrument Corp.

This report's goal is to identify and share a combination of available workforce data and on -the-ground intelligence to foster discussion and align strategies around the region 's critical skills gaps. Highlighting data from the last 12 months for the core focus sectors identified by the Long Island Regional Economic Development Council's Workforce, Edu cation & Veterans Committee , this report aims to identify employer needs and the skills we should be cultivating to better prepare and qualify Long Islanders for good, open jobs. Even with a clear goal and reliable, diverse resources , this report is not a flawless representation of the job market. Online postings routinely omit critical data (pay rates, education al requirements, etc. ). Many industries (manufacturing, agriculture, etc.) rely on word -of-mouth referrals for a large portion of their hiring . No single labor market data source can provide a comprehensive picture of the current labor market. This report synthesizes the best available online job market data with WDI's first- person, ground -level workforce intelligence for the purpose of engaging in a common dialogue, furthering inquiry , and implement ing collaborative strate gic solutions for Long Island. There are many questions this report's information raises, among them: What are Long Island employers looking for in job candidates? How does it change from year to year ? How can Long Island support job seekers and employers to get the best match? What gaps exist between what employers want and what the job market looks like to workforce development professionals? What can be done to a ddress these gaps? How will this change in coming years? We encourage our regional partners and employers to join this workforce dialogue.

These reflect courses offered and does not, at this time, include a breakdown of the individual skills. In addition, the data is based on feedback provided by the departments and institutions that responded. The committee will work over the next year to obtain data from those that did not re spond including institutions as a whole and departments which offer degrees or teach subjects related to employment. As an example: Several Pharmaceutical Manufacturing positions require chemistry. We know our institutions offer courses and degrees in Chemistry. Academic deans of those departments did not respond and therefore we cannot yet determine a) what subjects are covered b) if the programs correlate to skill s needed for available jobs c) if students in those programs are being made aware of/p repared for jobs where Chemistry is a key component. In other areas, we know that students interested in Chemistry can choose their course of study to focus on academic applications or industry application of Chemistry. Additional Notes Agriculture & Ma nufacturing - While the committee initially chose Agriculture as a separate sector, further research revealed that the most jobs in this sector relate to taking the products grown and manufacturing them. This ranges from artisanal producers for the farm -to-to table movement as well as larger scale wine/beverage manufactures. Thus these are covered in manufacturing and not a stand -along sector. IT should also be recognized that a large portion of the production -level manufacturing job opportunities are not posted and instead rely on word -of-mouth, lawn signs and walk -ins. Retail & Hospitality - To more accurately assess open jobs in hospitality, this has been broken down into retail, accommodation and food service as the jobs are most commonly posted in the se \"baskets.\" Information Technology - Technology related jobs exist across all sectors and thus are difficult to extract is a stand -alone group. For the sake of this report, the group looked at Information Technology.
