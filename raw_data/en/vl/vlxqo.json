In the furtherance of this policy it will attempt to prevent and abate the pollution of all waters to the fullest extent possible consistent with statutory and technological limitations. This policy shall apply to all point and nonpoint sources of pollution. These water quality standards establish selected criteria for certain present and future designated uses of the surface waters of the state. The standards establish the areas where these uses are to be protected and provide minimum criteria for waterways having nondesignated uses as well. Many surface waters are designated for more than one use. In these cases the more stringent criteria shall govern for each parameter . Certain of the criteria are in narrative form without numeric limitations. In applying such narrative standards, decisions will be based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency' s methodology described in \"Guidelines for Deriving Numerical National W ater Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Or ganisms and Their Uses,\" (1985) and on the rationale contained in \"Quality Criteria for W ater ,\" published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (1977), as updated by supplemental Section 304 (of the Act) Ambient W ater Quality Criteria documents. T o provide human health criteria for parameters not having numerical values listed in 61.3(3) T able 1, the required criteria will be based on the rationale contained in these EP A criteria documents. The human health criterion considered will be the value associated with the consumption of fish flesh and a risk factor of 10 - 5 for carcinogenic parameters. For noncarcinogenic parameters, the recommended EP A criterion will be selected. For Class C water , the EP A criteria for fish and water consumption will be selected using the same considerations for carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic parameters as noted above. All methods of sample collection, preservation, and analysis used in applying any of the rules in these standards shall be in accord with those prescribed in 567\u2014Chapter 63 . 61.2 (2) Antidegradation policy . It is the policy of the state of Iowa that: a. T ier 1 protection.

Where the quality of the waters exceeds levels necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the water , that quality shall be maintained and protected unless the department finds, after full satisfaction of the inter governmental coordination and public participation provisions, that allowing lower water quality is necessary to accommodate important economic or social development in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation or lower water quality , the department shall ensure water quality adequate to protect existing uses fully .

United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) nationwide permits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51, and 52 as well as Corps regional permits 7, 27, 33, and 34 as revised through July 16, 2014, are certified pursuant to Section 401 of the Clean W ater Act subject to the following Corps regional conditions and the state water quality conditions: (1) Side slopes of a newly constructed channel will be no steeper than 2:1 and planted to permanent, perennial, native vegetation if not armored. (2) Nationwide permits with mitigation may require recording of the nationwide permit and pertinent drawings with the registrar of deeds or other appropriate of ficial char ged with the responsibility for maintaining records of title to, or interest in, real property and may also require the permittee to provide proof of that recording to the Corps. (3) Mitigation shall be scheduled prior to, or concurrent with, the dischar ge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States. (4) For newly constructed channels through areas that are unvegetated, native grass filter strips, or a riparian buf fer with native trees or shrubs a minimum of 35 feet wide from the top of the bank must be planted along both sides of the new channel. A survival rate of 80 percent of desirable species shall be achieved within three years of establishment of the buf fer strip. (5) For single-family residences authorized under nationwide permit 29, the permanent loss of waters of the United States (including jurisdictional wetlands) must not exceed 1/4 acre. (6) For nationwide permit 46, the dischar ge of dredged or fill material into ditches that would sever the jurisdiction of an upstream water of the United States from a downstream water of the United States is not allowed. (7) For projects that impact an outstanding national resource water , outstanding Iowa water , fens, bogs, seeps, or sedge meadows, an individual Section 401 W ater Quality Certification will be required (Iowa Section 401 W ater Quality Certification condition). (8) For nationwide permits when the Corps' district engineer has issued a waiver to allow the permittee to exceed the limits of the nationwide permit, an individual Section 401 W ater Quality Certification will be required (Iowa Section 401 W ater Quality Certification condition). (9) Heavy equipment shall not be used or operated within the stream channel. If in-stream work is unavoidable, it shall be performed in such a manner as to minimize the duration of the disturbance, turbidity increases, substrate disturbance, bank disturbance, and disturbance to riparian vegetation. This condition does not further restrict otherwise authorized drainage ditch maintenance activities (Iowa Section 401 W ater Quality Certification condition). W ritten verification by the Corps or 401 certification by the state is required for activities covered by these permits as required by the nationwide permits or the Corps, and the activities are allowed subject to the terms and conditions of the nationwide and regional permits. The department will maintain and periodically update a guidance document listing special waters of concern. This document will be provided to the Corps for use in determining whether preconstruction notices should be provided to the department and other interested parties prior to taking action on applications for projects that would normally be covered by a nationwide or regional permit and not require a preconstruction notice under nationwide permit conditions. 61.2 (3) Minimum tr eatment r equir ed. All wastes dischar ged to the waters of the state must be of such quality that the dischar ge will not cause the narrative or numeric criteria limitations to be exceeded. Where the receiving waters provide suf ficient assimilative capacity that the water quality standards are IAC 10/7/20 Environmental Protection[567] Ch 61, p. 3 not the limiting factor , all point source wastes shall receive treatment in compliance with minimum ef fluent standards as adopted in rules by the department. There are numerous parameters of water quality associated with nonpoint source runof f which are of significance to the designated water uses specified in the general and specific designations in 567\u201461.3 (455B), but which are not delineated. It shall be the intent of these standards that the limits on such nonpoint source related parameters when adopted shall be those that can be achieved by best management practices as defined in the course of the continuing planning process from time to time. Existing water quality and nonpoint source runof f control technology will be evaluated in the course of the Iowa continuing planning process, and best management practices and limitations on specific water quality parameters will be reviewed and revised from time to time to ensure that the designated water uses and water quality enhancement goals are met. 61.2 (4) Regulatory mixing zones. Mixing zones are recognized as being necessary for the initial assimilation of point source dischar ges which have received the required degree of treatment or control. Mixing zones shall not be used for , or considered as, a substitute for minimum treatment technology required by subrule 61.2(3) . The objective of establishing mixing zones is to provide a means of control over the placement and emission of point source dischar ges so as to minimize environmental impacts. W aters within a mixing zone shall meet the general water quality criteria of subrule 61.3(2) . W aters at and beyond mixing zone boundaries shall meet all applicable standards and the chronic and human health criteria of subrule 61.3(3) , T ables 1 and 3, for that particular water body or segment. A zone of initial dilution may be established within the mixing zone beyond which the applicable standards and the acute criteria of subrule 61.3(3) will be met. For waters designated under subrule 61.3(5) , any parameter not included in T ables 1, 2 and 3 of subrule 61.3(3) , the chronic and human health criteria, and the acute criterion calculated following subrule 61.2(1) , will be met at the mixing zone and zone of initial dilution boundaries, respectively . a. Due to extreme variations in wastewater and receiving water characteristics, spatial dimensions of mixing zones shall be defined on a site-specific basis. These rules are not intended to define each individual mixing zone, but will set maximum limits which will satisfy most biological, chemical, physical and radiological considerations in defining a particular mixing zone. Additional details are noted in the \"Iowa W asteload Allocation (WLA) Procedure,\" as revised on November 1 1, 2020, for considering unusual site-specific features such as side channels and sand bars which may influence a mixing zone. Applications for operation permits under 567\u2014subrule 64.3(1) may be required to provide specific information related to the mixing zone characteristics below their outfall so that mixing zone boundaries can be determined. b. For parameters included in T able 1 only (which does not include ammonia nitrogen), the dimensions of the mixing zone and the zone of initial dilution will be calculated using a mathematical model presented in the \"Iowa W asteload Allocation (WLA) Procedure,\" as revised on November 1 1, 2020, or from instream studies of the mixing characteristics during low flow . In addition, the most restrictive of the following factors will be met: (1) The stream flow in the mixing zone may not exceed the most restrictive of the following: 1. T wenty-five percent of the design low stream flows noted in subrule 61.2(5) for interior streams and rivers, and the Big Sioux and Des Moines Rivers. 2. T en percent of the design low stream flows noted in subrule 61.2(5) for the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. 3. The stream flow contained in the mixing zone at the most restrictive of the applicable mixing zone length criteria, noted below . (2) The length of the mixing zone below the point of dischar ge shall be set by the most restrictive of the following: 1. The distance to the juncture of two perennial streams. 2. The distance to a public water supply intake. 3. The distance to the upstream limits of an established recreational area, such as public beaches, and state, county and local parks. Ch 61, p. 4 Environmental Protection[567] IAC 10/7/20 4. The distance to the middle of a crossover point in a stream where the main current flows from one bank across to the opposite bank. 5. The distance to another mixing zone. 6. Not to exceed a distance of 2000 feet. 7. The location where the mixing zone contained the percentages of stream flow noted in 61.2(4) \"b\" (1). (3) The width of the mixing zone is calculated as the portion of the stream containing the allowed mixing zone stream flow . The mixing zone width will be measured perpendicular to the basic direction of stream flow at the downstream boundary of the mixing zone. This measurement will only consider the distance of continuous water surface. (4) The width and length of the zone of initial dilution may not exceed 10 percent of the width and length of the mixing zone. c. The stream flow used in determining wasteload allocations to ensure compliance with the maximum contaminant level (MCL), chronic and human health criteria of T able 1 will be that value contained at the boundary of the allowed mixing zone. This stream flow may not exceed the following percentages of the design low stream flow as measured at the point of dischar ge: (1) T wenty-five percent for interior streams and rivers, and the Big Sioux and Des Moines Rivers. (2) T en percent for the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. The stream flow in the zone of initial dilution used in determining ef fluent limits to ensure compliance with the acute criteria of T able 1 may not exceed 10 percent of the calculated flow associated with the mixing zone. d. For toxic parameters noted in T able 1, the following exceptions apply to the mixing zone requirements: (1) No mixing zone or zone of initial dilution will be allowed for waters designated as lakes or wetlands. (2) No zone of initial dilution will be allowed in waters designated as cold water . (3) The use of a dif fuser device to promote rapid mixing of an ef fluent in a receiving stream will be considered on a case-by-case basis with its usage as a means for dischar gers to comply with an acute numerical criterion. (4) A dischar ger to interior streams and rivers, the Big Sioux and Des Moines Rivers, and the Mississippi or Missouri Rivers may provide to the department, for consideration, instream data which technically supports the allowance of an increased percentage of the stream flow contained in the mixing zone due to rapid and complete mixing. Any allowed increase in mixing zone flow would still be governed by the mixing zone length restrictions. The submission of data should follow the guidance provided in the \"Iowa W asteload Allocation (WLA) Procedure,\" as revised on November 1 1, 2020. e. For ammonia criteria noted in T able 3, the dimensions of the mixing zone and the zone of initial dilution will be calculated using a mathematical model presented in the \"Iowa W asteload Allocation (WLA) Procedure,\" as revised on November 1 1, 2020, or from instream studies of the mixing characteristics during low flow . In addition, the most restrictive of the following factors will be met: (1) The stream flow in the mixing zone may not exceed the most restrictive of the following: 1. One hundred percent of the design low stream flows noted in subrule 61.2(5) for locations where the dilution ratio is less than or equal to 2:1. 2.

T wenty-five percent of the design low stream flows noted in subrule 61.2(5) for locations where the dilution ratio is greater than 5:1. 4. The stream flow contained in the mixing zone at the most restrictive of the applicable mixing zone length criteria, noted below . (2) The length of the mixing zone below the point of dischar ge shall be set by the most restrictive of the following: 1. The distance to the juncture of two perennial streams. 2. The distance to a public water supply intake. IAC 10/7/20 Environmental Protection[567] Ch 61, p. 5 3. The distance to the upstream limits of an established recreational area, such as public beaches, and state, county , and local parks. 4. The distance to the middle of a crossover point in a stream where the main current flows from one bank across to the opposite bank. 5. The distance to another mixing zone. 6. Not to exceed a distance of 2000 feet. 7. The location where the mixing zone contained the percentages of stream flow noted in 61.2(4) \"e\" (1). (3) The width of the mixing zone is calculated as the portion of the stream containing the allowed mixing zone stream flow . The mixing zone width will be measured perpendicular to the basic direction of stream flow at the downstream boundary of the mixing zone. This measurement will only consider the distance of continuous water surface. (4) The width and length of the zone of initial dilution may not exceed 10 percent of the width and length of the mixing zone. f. For ammonia criteria noted in T able 3, the stream flow used in determining wasteload allocations to ensure compliance with the chronic criteria of T able 3 will be that value contained at the boundary of the allowed mixing zone. This stream flow may not exceed the percentages of the design low stream flow noted in 61.2(4) \"e\" (1) as measured at the point of dischar ge. The pH and temperature values at the boundary of the mixing zone used to select the chronic ammonia criteria of T able 3 will be from one of the following sources. The source of the pH and temperature data will follow the sequence listed below , if applicable data exists from the source. (1) Specific pH and temperature data provided by the applicant gathered at their mixing zone boundary . Procedures for obtaining this data are noted in the \"Iowa W asteload Allocation (WLA) Procedure,\" as revised on November 1 1, 2020. (2) Regional background pH and temperature data provided by the applicant gathered along the receiving stream and representative of the background conditions at the outfall. Procedures for obtaining this data are noted in the \"Iowa W asteload Allocation (WLA) Procedure,\" as revised on November 1 1, 2020. (3) The statewide median background values as determined by the department. The stream flow in the zone of initial dilution used in determining ef fluent limits to ensure compliance with the acute criteria of T able 3 may not exceed 5 percent of the calculated flow associated with the mixing zone for facilities with a dilution ratio of less than or equal to 2:1, and not exceed 10 percent of the calculated flow associated with the mixing zone for facilities with a dilution ratio of greater than 2:1. The pH and temperature values at the boundary of the zone of initial dilution used to select the acute ammonia criteria of T able 3 will be from one of the following sources and follow the sequence listed below , if applicable data exists from the source. 1. Specific ef fluent pH and temperature data if the dilution ratio is less than or equal to 2:1. 2. If the dilution ratio is greater than 2:1, the logarithmic average pH of the ef fluent and the regional or statewide pH provided in 61.2(4) \"f\" will be used. In addition, the flow proportioned average temperature of the ef fluent and the regional or statewide temperature provided in 61.2(4) \"f\" will be used. The procedures for calculating these data are noted in the \"Iowa W asteload Allocation (WLA) Procedure,\" as revised on November 1 1, 2020. g. For ammonia criteria noted in T able 3, the following exceptions apply to the mixing zone requirements. (1) No mixing zone or zone of initial dilution will be allowed for waters designated as lakes or wetlands. (2) No zone of initial dilution will be allowed in waters designated as cold water . (3) The use of a dif fuser device to promote rapid mixing of an ef fluent in a receiving stream will be considered on a case-by-case basis with its usage as a means for dischar gers to comply with an acute numerical criterion. (4) A dischar ger to interior streams and rivers, the Big Sioux and Des Moines Rivers, and the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers may provide to the department, for consideration, instream data which Ch 61, p. 6 Environmental Protection[567] IAC 10/7/20 technically supports the allowance of an increased percentage of the stream flow contained in the mixing zone due to rapid and complete mixing. Any allowed increase in mixing zone flow would still be governed by the mixing zone length restrictions. The submission of data should follow the guidance provided in the \"Iowa W asteload Allocation (WLA) Procedure,\" as revised on November 1 1, 2020. h. T emperature changes within mixing zones established for heat dissipation will not exceed the temperature criteria in 61.3(3) \"b\" (5) . i. The appropriateness of establishing a mixing zone where a substance dischar ged is bioaccumulative, persistent, carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic will be carefully evaluated. In such cases, ef fects such as potential groundwater contamination, sediment deposition, fish attraction, bioaccumulation in aquatic life, bioconcentration in the food chain, and known or predicted safe exposure levels shall be considered. 61.2 (5) Implementation strategy . Numerical criteria specified in these water quality standards shall be met when the flow of the receiving stream equals or exceeds the design low flows noted below . T ype of Numerical Criteria Design Low Flow Regime Aquatic Life Protection (T OXICS) Acute 1Q 1 0 Chronic 7Q 1 0 Aquatic Life Protection (AMMONIA - N) Acute 1Q 1 0 Chronic 30Q 1 0 Human Health Protection & MCL Noncarcinogenic 30Q 5 Carcinogenic Harmonic mean a. The allowable 3\u00b0C temperature increase criterion for warm water interior streams, 61.3(3) \"b\" (5) \"1,\" is based in part on the need to protect fish from cold shock due to rapid cessation of heat source and resultant return of the receiving stream temperature to natural background temperature. On low flow streams, in winter , during certain conditions of relatively cold background stream temperature and relatively warm ambient air and groundwater temperature, certain wastewater treatment plants with relatively constant flow and constant temperature dischar ges will cause temperature increases in the receiving stream greater than allowed in 61.3(3) \"b\" (5) \"1.\" b. During the period November 1 to March 31, for the purpose of applying the 3\u00b0C temperature increase criterion, the minimum protected receiving stream flow rate below such dischar ges may be increased to not more than three times the rate of flow of the dischar ge, where there is reasonable assurance that the dischar ge is of such constant temperature and flow rate and continuous duration as to not constitute a threat of heat cessation and not cause the receiving stream temperature to vary more than 3\u00b0C per day . c. Site-specific water quality criteria may be allowed in lieu of the specific numerical criteria listed in T ables 1 and 3 of this chapter if adequate documentation is provided to show that the proposed criteria will protect all existing or potential uses of the surface water . Site-specific water quality criteria may be appropriate where: (1) The types of or ganisms dif fer significantly from those used in setting the statewide criteria; or (2) The chemical characteristics of the surface water such as pH, temperature, and hardness dif fer significantly from the characteristics used in setting the statewide criteria. Development of site-specific criteria shall include an evaluation of the chemical and biological characteristics of the water resource and an evaluation of the impact of the dischar ge. All evaluations for site-specific criteria modification must be coordinated through the department, and be conducted using scientifically accepted procedures approved by the department. Any site-specific criterion developed under the provisions of this subrule is subject to the review and approval of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . All criteria approved under the provisions of this subrule will be IAC 10/7/20 Environmental Protection[567] Ch 61, p. 7 published periodically by the department. Guidelines for establishing site-specific water quality criteria can be found in \"W ater Quality Standards Handbook,\" published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , December 1983. d. A wastewater treatment facility may submit to the department technically valid instream data which provides additional information to be used in the calculations of their wasteload allocations and ef fluent limitations. This information would be in association with the low flow characteristics, width, length and time of travel associated with the mixing zone or decay rates of various ef fluent parameters. The wasteload allocation will be calculated considering the applicable data and consistent with the provisions and restrictions in the rules. e. The department may perform use assessment and related use attainability analyses on water bodies where uses may not be known or adequately documented. The preparation of use attainability analysis documents will consider available U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidance or other applicable guidance. Credible data and documentation will be used to assist in the preparation of use assessments and use attainability analysis reports. [ ARC 8214B 1 (See note at Surface water quality criteria. 61.3 (1) Surface water classification. All waters of the state are classified for protection of beneficial uses. These classified waters include general use segments and designated use segments. a. General use segments. These are intermittent watercourses and those watercourses which typically flow only for short periods of time following precipitation and whose channels are normally above the water table. These waters do not support a viable aquatic community during low flow and do not maintain pooled conditions during periods of no flow . The general use segments are to be protected for livestock and wildlife watering, aquatic life, noncontact recreation, crop irrigation, and industrial, agricultural, domestic and other incidental water withdrawal uses. b. Designated use segments. These are water bodies which maintain flow throughout the year or contain suf ficient pooled areas during intermittent flow periods to maintain a viable aquatic community . All perennial rivers and streams as identified by the U.S. Geological Survey 1:100,000 DLG Hydrography Data Map (published July 1993) or intermittent streams with perennial pools in Iowa not specifically listed in the surface water classification of 61.3(5) are designated as Class B(WW -1) waters. All perennial rivers and streams as identified by the U.S. Geological Survey 1:100,000 DLG Hydrography Data Map (published July 1993) or intermittent streams with perennial pools in Iowa are designated as Class A1 waters. Designated uses of segments may change based on a use attainability analysis consistent with 61.2(5) \"e.\" Designated use changes will be specifically listed in the surface water classification of 61.3(5) . Designated use waters are to be protected for all uses of general use segments in addition to the specific uses assigned. Designated use segments include: (1) Primary contact recreational use (Class \"A1\"). W aters in which recreational or other uses may result in prolonged and direct contact with the water , involving considerable risk of ingesting water in quantities suf ficient to pose a health hazard. Such activities would include, but not be limited to, swimming, diving, water skiing, and water contact recreational canoeing. (2) Secondary contact recreational use (Class \"A2\"). W aters in which recreational or other uses may result in contact with the water that is either incidental or accidental. During the recreational use, the probability of ingesting appreciable quantities of water is minimal. Class A2 uses include fishing, commercial and recreational boating, any limited contact incidental to shoreline activities and activities in which users do not swim or float in the water body while on a boating activity . Ch 61, p. 8 Environmental Protection[567] IAC 10/7/20 (3) Children' s recreational use (Class \"A3\"). W aters in which recreational uses by children are common. Class A3 waters are water bodies having definite banks and bed with visible evidence of the flow or occurrence of water . This type of use would primarily occur in urban or residential areas. (4) Cold water aquatic life\u2014T ype 1 (Class \"B(CW1)\"). W aters in which the temperature and flow are suitable for the maintenance of a variety of cold water species, including reproducing and nonreproducing populations of trout ( Salmonidae family) and associated aquatic communities. (5) Cold water aquatic life\u2014T ype 2 (Class \"B(CW2)\"). W aters that include small, channeled streams, headwaters, and spring runs that possess natural cold water attributes of temperature and flow . These waters usually do not support consistent populations of trout ( Salmonidae family), but may support associated vertebrate and invertebrate or ganisms. (6) W arm water\u2014T ype 1 (Class \"B(WW -1)\"). W aters in which temperature, flow and other habitat characteristics are suitable to maintain warm water game fish populations along with a resident aquatic community that includes a variety of native nongame fish and invertebrate species. These waters generally include border rivers, lar ge interior rivers, and the lower segments of medium-size tributary streams. (7) W arm water\u2014T ype 2 (Class \"B(WW -2)\"). W aters in which flow or other physical characteristics are capable of supporting a resident aquatic community that includes a variety of native nongame fish and invertebrate species. The flow and other physical characteristics limit the maintenance of warm water game fish populations. These waters generally consist of small perennially flowing streams. (8) W arm water\u2014T ype 3 (Class \"B(WW -3)\"). W aters in which flow persists during periods when antecedent soil moisture and groundwater dischar ge levels are adequate; however , aquatic habitat typically consists of nonflowing pools during dry periods of the year . These waters generally include small streams of mar ginally perennial aquatic habitat status. Such waters support a limited variety of native fish and invertebrate species that are adapted to survive in relatively harsh aquatic conditions. (9) Lakes and wetlands (Class \"B(L W)\"). These are artificial and natural impoundments with hydraulic retention times and other physical and chemical characteristics suitable to maintain a balanced community normally associated with lake-like conditions. (10) Human health (Class \"HH\"). W aters in which fish are routinely harvested for human consumption or waters both designated as a drinking water supply and in which fish are routinely harvested for human consumption. (1 1) Drinking water supply (Class \"C\"). W aters which are used as a raw water source of potable water supply . 61.3 (2) General water quality criteria. The following criteria are applicable to all surface waters including general use and designated use waters, at all places and at all times for the uses described in 61.3(1) \"a.\" a. Such waters shall be free from substances attributable to point source wastewater dischar ges that will settle to form sludge deposits. b. Such waters shall be free from floating debris, oil, grease, scum and other floating materials attributable to wastewater dischar ges or agricultural practices in amounts suf ficient to create a nuisance. c. Such waters shall be free from materials attributable to wastewater dischar ges or agricultural practices producing objectionable color , odor or other aesthetically objectionable conditions. d. Such waters shall be free from substances attributable to wastewater dischar ges or agricultural practices in concentrations or combinations which are acutely toxic to human, animal, or plant life. e. Such waters shall be free from substances, attributable to wastewater dischar ges or agricultural practices, in quantities which would produce undesirable or nuisance aquatic life. f. The turbidity of the receiving water shall not be increased by more than 25 Nephelometric turbidity units by any point source dischar ge. g. Cations and anions guideline values to protect livestock watering may be found in the \"Iowa W asteload Allocation (WLA) Procedure,\" as revised on November 1 1, 2020. h. The Escherichia coli (E. coli) content of water which enters a sinkhole or losing stream segment, regardless of the water body' s designated use, shall not exceed a Geometric Mean value of IAC 10/7/20 Environmental Protection[567] Ch 61, p. 9 126 or ganisms/100 ml or a sample maximum value of 235 or ganisms/100 ml. No new wastewater dischar ges will be allowed on watercourses which directly or indirectly enter sinkholes or losing stream segments. 61.3 (3) Specific water quality criteria. a. Class \"A\" waters. W aters which are designated as Class \"A1,\" \"A2,\" or \"A3\" in subrule 61.3(5) are to be protected for primary contact, secondary contact, and children' s recreational uses. The general criteria of subrule 61.3(2) and the following specific criteria apply to all Class \"A\" waters. (1) The Escherichia coli (E. coli) content shall not exceed the levels noted in the Bacteria Criteria T able when the Class \"A1,\" \"A2,\" or \"A3\" uses can reasonably be expected to occur . Bacteria Criteria T able (or ganisms/100 ml of water) Use or Category Geometric Mean Sample Maximum Class A1 3/15 - 1 1/15 126 235 1 1/16 - 3/14 Does not apply Does not apply Class A2 (Only) 3/15 - 1 1/15 630 2880 1 1/16 - 3/14 Does not apply Does not apply [Class A2 and B(CW)] or OIW or 630 2880 Class A3 3/15 - 1 1/15 126 235 1 1/16 - 3/14 Does not apply Does not apply Class A1 - Primary Contact Recreational Use Class A2 - Secondary Contact Recreational Use Class A3 - Children' s Recreational Use When a water body is designated for more than one of the recreational uses, the most stringent criteria for the appropriate season shall apply . (2) The pH shall not be less than 6.5 nor greater than 9.0. The maximum change permitted as a result of a waste dischar ge shall not exceed 0.5 pH units. b. Class \"B\" waters. All waters which are designated as Class B(CW1), B(CW2), B(WW -1), B(WW -2), B(WW -3) or B(L W) are to be protected for wildlife, fish, aquatic, and semiaquatic life. The following criteria shall apply to all Class \"B\" waters designated in subrule 61.3(5) . (1) Dissolved oxygen. Dissolved oxygen shall not be less than the values shown in T able 2 of this subrule. (2) pH. The pH shall not be less than 6.5 nor greater than 9.0. The maximum change permitted as a result of a waste dischar ge shall not exceed 0.5 pH units. (3) General chemical constituents. The specific numerical criteria shown in T ables 1, 2, and 3 of this subrule apply to all waters designated in subrule 61.3(5) . The sole determinant of compliance with these criteria will be established by the department on a case-by-case basis. Ef fluent monitoring or instream monitoring, or both, will be the required approach to determine compliance. 1. The acute criteria represent the level of protection necessary to prevent acute toxicity to aquatic life. Instream concentrations above the acute criteria will be allowed only within the boundaries of the zone of initial dilution. 2. The chronic criteria represent the level of protection necessary to prevent chronic toxicity to aquatic life. Excursions above the chronic criteria will be allowed only inside of mixing zones or only for short-term periods outside of mixing zones; however , these excursions cannot exceed the acute criteria shown in T ables 1 and 3. The chronic criteria will be met as short-term average conditions at all times Ch 61, p. 10 Environmental Protection[567] IAC 10/7/20 the flow equals or exceeds either the design flows noted in subrule 61.2(5) or any site-specific low flow established under the provisions of subrule 61.2(5). 3. Rescinded IAB (5) T emperature. 1. No heat shall be added to interior streams or the Big Sioux River that would cause an increase of more than 3\u00b0C.

In addition, the water temperature at representative locations in the Mississippi River shall not exceed the maximum limits in the table below during more than 1 percent of the hours in the 12-month period ending with any month. Moreover , at no time shall the water temperature at such locations exceed the maximum limits in the table below by more than 2\u00b0C. Zone II\u2014Iowa-Minnesota state line to the northern Illinois border (Mile Point 1534.6). Zone III\u2014Northern Illinois border (Mile Point 1534.6) to Iowa-Missouri state line. Month Zone II Zone III January 4\u00b0C February 9\u00b0C 1 1\u00b0C (6) Early life stage for each use designation. The following seasons will be used in applying the early life stage present chronic criteria noted in T able 3b, \"Chronic Criterion for Ammonia in Iowa Streams - Early Life Stages Present.\" 1. For all Class B(CW1) waters, the early life stage will be year -round. 2. For all Class B(CW2) waters, the early life stage will begin on April 1 and last through September 30. 3. For all Class B(WW -1) waters, the early life stage will begin in March and last through September , except as follows: For the following, the early life stage will begin in February and last through September: \u2014The entire length of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, \u2014The lower reach of the Des Moines River south of the Ottumwa dam, and IAC 10/7/20 Environmental Protection[567] Ch 61, p. 1 1 \u2014The lower reach of the Iowa River below the Cedar River . For the following, the early life stage will begin in April and last through September: \u2014All Class B(WW -1) waters in the Southern Iowa River Basin, \u2014All of the Class B(WW -1) reach of the Skunk River , the North Skunk River and the South Skunk River south of Indian Creek (Jasper County), and the Class B(WW -1) tributaries to these reaches, and the entire Class B(WW -1) reach of the English River . 4. For all Class B(WW -2) and Class B(WW -3) waters, the early life stage will begin in April and last through September . 5. For all Class B(L W) lake and wetland waters, the early life stage will begin in March and last through September except for the Class B(L W) waters in the southern two tiers of Iowa counties which will have the early life stage of April through September . c. Class \"C\" waters. W aters which are designated as Class \"C\" are to be protected as a raw water source of potable water supply . The following criteria shall apply to all Class \"C\" waters designated in subrule 61.3(5) . (1) Radioactive substances. 1. The combined radium-226 and radium-228 shall not exceed 5 picocuries per liter at the point of withdrawal. 2. Gross alpha particle activity (including radium-226 but excluding radon and uranium) shall not exceed 15 picocuries per liter at the point of withdrawal. 3. The average annual concentration at the point of withdrawal of beta particle and photon radioactivity from man-made radionuclides other than tritium and strontium-90 shall not produce an annual dose equivalent to the total body or any internal or gan greater than 4 millirem/year . 4. The average annual concentration of tritium shall not exceed 20,000 picocuries per liter at the point of withdrawal; the average annual concentration of strontium-90 shall not exceed 8 picocuries per liter at the point of withdrawal. (2) All substances toxic or detrimental to humans or detrimental to treatment process shall be limited to nontoxic or nondetrimental concentrations in the surface water . (3) The pH shall not be less than 6.5 nor greater than 9.0. d. Class \"HH\" waters. W aters which are designated as Class HH shall contain no substances in concentrations which will make fish or shellfish inedible due to undesirable tastes or cause a hazard to humans after consumption. (1) The human health criteria represent the level of protection necessary , in the case of noncarcinogens, to prevent adverse health ef fects in humans and, in the case of carcinogens, to prevent a level of incremental cancer risk not exceeding 1 in 100,000. Instream concentrations in excess of the human health criteria will be allowed only within the boundaries of the mixing zone. (2) Reserved. T ABLE 1. Criteria for Chemical Constituents (all values as micr ograms per liter as total r ecoverable unless noted otherwise) Human health criteria for carcinogenic parameters noted below were based on the prevention of an incremental cancer risk of 1 in 100,000. For parameters not having a noted human health criterion, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has not developed final national human health guideline values. For noncarcinogenic parameters, the recommended EP A criterion was selected. For Class C waters, the EP A criteria for fish and water consumption were selected using the same considerations for carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic parameters as noted above. For Class C waters for which no EP A human health criteria were available, the EP A MCL value was selected.

[ , ORING DA T A REQUIREMENTS 567\u201461. 10 (455B) Purpose. The department uses water quality monitoring data for a number of purposes, including determining compliance with ef fluent limits for operation permits issued under 567\u2014Chapter 64 . The department also uses water quality monitoring data to determine the relative health of a water body by comparing monitoring data to the appropriate water quality standards established in 567\u2014Chapter 61 , a process known as water body assessments. W ater body assessments are performed to prepare the biennial water quality report required under Section 305(b) of the Act and the list of impaired waters under Section 303(d) of the Act. Iowa Code sections 455B.193 to 455B.195 require that credible data, as defined in Iowa Code section 455B.171 , be used for the purpose of preparing Section 303(d) lists and other water quality program functions. Data provided by a volunteer are not considered credible data unless provided by a qualified volunteer . The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum requirements for data produced by volunteers to meet the credible data and qualified volunteer requirements. IAC 10/7/20 Environmental Protection[567] Ch 61, p. 23 567\u201461. 1 1 (455B) Monitoring plan r equir ed. V olunteer water quality monitoring data submitted to the department must have been produced in accordance with a department-approved volunteer water quality monitoring plan before the data may be used for any of the purposes listed in Iowa Code section 455B.194 . Approval of a plan will establish qualified volunteer status for the personnel identified in the plan for those monitoring activities covered under the plan. 61.1 1 (1) Submittal of the plan. Prior to initiation of volunteer water quality monitoring activities intended to produce credible data, a water quality monitoring plan must be submitted to the department for review and approval. The plan must be submitted to the V olunteer Monitoring Coordinator , Department of Natural Resources, W allace State Of fice Building, Des Moines, Iowa 50319, a minimum of 90 days before planned initiation of volunteer monitoring activities. A letter transmitting the plan must specifically request formal review and approval of the plan and identify a contact person. V olunteer monitors are encouraged to communicate with the department and to attend volunteer monitoring training sessions prior to formal submittal of a plan. 61.1 1 (2) Content of the plan. A volunteer monitoring plan must contain, at a minimum, the following to be considered an acceptable volunteer monitoring plan: a. A statement of the intent of the monitoring ef fort. b. The name(s) of the person or persons that will be involved in data collection or analysis, the specific responsibilities of each person or group of people, and the general qualifications of the volunteers to carry out those responsibilities. For groups, such as educational institutions, it will be acceptable to identify the persons involved by general description (e.g., tenth grade biology class) with the exception of persons in responsible char ge. c. The name(s) of the person or persons that will oversee the monitoring plan, ensure that quality assurance and control objectives are being met, and certify the data. The person or persons in responsible char ge must have training commensurate with the level of expertise to ensure that credible data is being generated. d. The duration of the volunteer monitoring ef fort. In general, the department will not approve plans of greater than three years' duration unless a longer duration is justified. e. Location and frequency of sample collection. f. Methods of data collection and analysis. g. Record keeping and data reporting procedures. 61.1 1 (3) Department r eview of the plan. The department will review monitoring plans and normally approve or disapprove the plan within 90 days of receipt. The department will work with the contact person identified in the plan to make any necessary changes prior to taking formal action. The department will use guidelines contained in the publications EP A Requirements for Quality Assurance Project Plans (EP A QA/R-5, 2001) and V olunteer Monitor ' s Guide to Quality Assurance Project Plans (1966, EP A 841-B-96-003) or equivalent updates to determine if the plans provide adequate quality assurance and quality control measures. Approval or disapproval of the plan will be in the form of a letter and approval may include conditions or limitations. 61.1 1 (4) Changes in monitoring plans. The department must approve any changes to an approved monitoring plan. Data collected under a modified plan will not be considered credible data until such time as the department has approved the modifications. Modifications to an approved plan should be submitted at the earliest possible time to avoid interruptions in data collection and to ensure continuity of data. 61.1 1 (5) Appeal of disappr oval. If a monitoring plan submitted for approval is disapproved, the decision may be appealed by filing an appeal with the director within 30 days of disapproval. The form of the notice of appeal and appeal procedures are governed by 567\u2014Chapter 7 . 567\u201461. 12 (455B) Use of volunteer monitoring data. Data produced under an approved water quality monitoring plan will be considered credible data for the purposes listed in Iowa Code section 455B.194 if the following conditions are met. 61.12 (1) Data submittal. A qualified volunteer monitor or qualified volunteer monitoring group must specifically request that data produced under an approved volunteer monitoring plan be considered Ch 61, p. 24 Environmental Protection[567] IAC 10/7/20 credible data. A letter identifying the specific data must be submitted along with a certification from the volunteer or the person in responsible char ge for volunteer groups that the data, to the best of the volunteer ' s or responsible person' s knowledge, was produced in accordance with the approved volunteer monitoring plan. The department shall provide a standard format on the IOW A TER website for submittal of qualified volunteer data and related information. The department encourages volunteers to enter monitoring data on the IOW A TER volunteer monitoring database maintained by the department, but doing so does not constitute submittal to or acceptance of the data by the department for uses requiring credible data. V olunteer data shall be labeled as such in any departmental reports, websites, or databases. 61.12 (2) Department r eview of submitted data. The department must review and approve the submitted data. The person submitting the data will be informed of the department' s decision either to accept or reject the data. The department will attempt to resolve any apparent inconsistencies or questionable values in the submitted data prior to making a final decision. 567\u201461. 13 (455B) Department audits of volunteer monitoring activities. The department shall conduct field audits of a statistically valid and representative sample of volunteer data collection and analysis procedures to ensure compliance with an approved plan and may conduct confirmatory monitoring tests. V olunteers shall be informed of any audit results and be provided with an opportunity to address any concerns to the extent possible. The department reserves the right to rescind approval of an approved plan if it finds substantial problems that cannot be addressed in a timely manner to ensure the quality of the data being produced. These rules are intended to implement Iowa Code chapter 455B, division III, part 1 .

The credit card was issued in A ' s name, and the cost of the room and meals is billed to A, who pays it. The federal government later reimburses A the entire cost of the room and meals. A has purchased the room and meals, and Iowa sales tax should be char ged accordingly . E XAMPLE C: B is a federal government employee who eats at a restaurant while on government business. B uses a credit card to pay for the meal. The credit card is issued in B' s name, but the cost of the meal is billed to the U.S. government which pays that cost. In this situation, the government is the purchaser of the meal on B' s behalf, and the sale is exempt from tax. See rule 701\u201434.12 (423) for an example of the application of this subrule to the motor vehicle use tax. 18.5 (3) The gross receipts from the sale of goods, wares, merchandise, or services used for public purposes to any tax-certifying or tax-levying body of the state of Iowa or governmental subdivision thereof, including the state board of regents, state department of human services, state department of transportation, and all divisions, boards, commissions, agencies, or instrumentalities of the state, federal, county , or municipal government which have no earnings going to the benefit of an equity investor or stockholder , except the sale of goods, wares, merchandise or services used by or in connection with the operation of any municipally owned public utility engaged in selling gas, electricity , pay television service, or heat to the general public, shall be exempt. The exclusion from exemption for municipally owned pay television service is applicable to sales occurring and services provided on and after July 1, 1991. On and after April 1, 1992, providing sewage service or solid waste collection and disposal service to a county or municipality on behalf of nonresidential commercial operations located within the county or municipality shall be taxable (see rules 701\u201426.71 (422,423) and 26.72 (422,423) for more information). Goods, wares, merchandise, or services used for public purposes and sold to any municipally owned solid waste facility which sells all or part of its processed waste as a fuel to a municipally owned public utility shall be exempt. E XAMPLES : a. A group of exempt instrumentalities, such as cities, issues bonds to finance the construction of a sewage disposal facility . X, a corporation, purchases the bonds but is not involved in the project in any other way . Since X does not enjoy the benefits of earnings of the solid waste facility , the exemption provided the instrumentalities is applicable. b. Corporation Y , which is an instrumentality of the federal government and which Congress has allowed by statute to be subject to state sales and use taxes, purchases tangible personal property . Said purchases are subject to tax because the profits of the corporation are distributed to the stockholders thereof. IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 3 c. An instrumentality of government includes an area agency on aging as designated by the Iowa department on aging pursuant to Iowa Code section 231.32 . This tax exemption does not apply to independent contractors who deal with agencies, instrumentalities, or other entities of government. These contractors do not, by virtue of their contracting with governmental entities, acquire any immunity or exemption from taxation for themselves. Sales to these contractors remain subject to tax, even if those sales are of goods or services which a contractor will use in the performance of a contract with a governmental entity . This principle is applicable to construction contractors who create or improve real property for federal, state, county , and municipal instrumentalities or agencies thereof. The contractors shall be subject to sales and use tax on all tangible personal property they purchase regardless of the identity of their construction contract sponsor . See 701\u2014Chapter 19 . See also NLO, Inc. v . Limbach, 613 N.E.2d 193, 66 Ohio St.3d 389 Roberts Inc. v . McNamara, 539 So.2d 1226 (La. 1989) reh. den. April 27, 1989; White Oak Corporation v . Department of Revenue Services, 503 A.2d 582, 198 Conn. 413 (1986). This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 422.45(5) . 701\u201418. 6 (422,423) Relief agencies. 18.6 (1) Relief agency means the state, any county , city and county , city or district thereof, or any agency engaged in actual relief work. Nonexclusive examples of relief agencies are Salvation Army , Royal Neighbors, and Masonic Lodge. The sales of tangible personal property or enumerated services to relief agencies are subject to tax. A relief agency may apply to the director for refund of the amount of tax imposed and paid by it, upon the purchase of goods, wares, merchandise, or services rendered, furnished, or performed that are used for free distribution to the poor and needy . 18.6 (2) Persons are determined to be in the poor and needy category when their incomes and resources are at or below poverty level. The department will use federal poverty guidelines in making this determination. 18.6 (3) Listed below are some examples where the tax may or may not be refunded to the relief agency: E XAMPLE : A relief agency purchases clothing for free distribution to a poor and needy person. The tax is refundable. E XAMPLE : A relief agency pays the gas, light, or telephone bill for a person who is poor and needy . The tax is refundable. E XAMPLE : An agency purchases items of clothing for residents of their living facility , and is partially reimbursed by the person using the items based upon the recipient' s ability to pay . T ax on the portion of cost not recovered by the agency can be claimed as a refund of tax paid by using formula stated in 18.6(6). 18.6 (4) Demolition v . repair costs. A nonprofit noneducational relief agency is not entitled to a refund of sales tax paid by contractors on building materials used in the alteration, expansion, repair , remodeling or construction of the facility since the materials were sold tax paid to the contractor who is the consumer of the material by statute. See Iowa Code section 422.42(9) . However , the relief agency would be entitled to a refund of sales tax paid on the cost of the demolition of the building since the demolition of the building indirectly benefited the poor and needy . 1968 O.A.G. #841. E XAMPLE : A relief agency , which is not part of a governmental unit, operates a home or orphanage for persons who are poor and needy or for orphan children. Food, lodging, and necessary items are furnished free-of-char ge to the residents. The relief agency would be entitled to a refund of any taxes paid to operate this facility; such as, but not limited to, lights, heat, water , telephone, and repair items or services needed to maintain the facility . 18.6 (5) Claims for refund must be filed quarterly with the department within 45 days after the end of the quarter for which the refund is claimed. Claims are to be submitted on forms provided by the department. The claim shall include the following information: Ch 18, p. 4 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 a.

Include the check number , receipt number , or paid invoice verifying payment. c. List the total operating income received (residents, donations, etc.) d. List the operating income received from residents only . e. The claim shall be signed by an authorized agent of the relief agency . 18.6 (6) When a relief agency receives part of its operating income from the poor and needy it is serving, this income will be considered in computing the tax refund paid upon sales to it of products or services used for free distribution to the poor and needy . T o reasonably approximate the correct amount of tax to be refunded, where only a portion of the tax qualifies for refund, a formula will be used by the department. The prescribed formula the department will allow is operating income received from the poor and needy served divided by total operating income received. This percentage will be multiplied by the applicable gross receipts which are considered refundable to arrive at the correct amount of tax to be refunded. If a person requests an alternative formula, the person shall first list the reasons why an alternative formula is necessary and, secondly , shall outline the proposed formula in detail. If approval is given, the department reserves the right to withdraw the approval or require adjustments in the formula upon notice to the person. Additional refunds or assessments may be made if an audit discloses the formula is incorrect.

E XAMPLE : A meat locker purchases materials such as wrapping paper and tape which it uses to wrap meat for customers to whom meat is sold. The wrapping paper and tape would be exempt from tax as being purchased as a packaging material of tangible personal property sold at retail. E XAMPLE : A meat locker purchases materials such as wrapping paper and tape which it uses to wrap meat for customers who own the meat. The meat locker only performs the service of processing the meat. The wrapping paper and tape are subject to tax as they were not purchased for packaging or for the facilitating of transportation of tangible personal property sold at retail, but were used in the rendering of a service. IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 5 b. Packing paper , lining paper , paper used to line boxes and crates, and similar items shall be exempt from the tax if delivered with tangible personal property ultimately sold at retail when no separate char ge is made for the paper . 18.7 (2) Labels, tags and nameplates. Sales of labels, tags, and nameplates attached to products for the benefit of the vendor such as shipping tags, price tags and instructions to cashiers are subject to the tax, unless such items are sold to manufacturers and retailers for packaging or facilitating the transportation of tangible personal property ultimately sold at retail.

This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 422.42(3) , 422.45(19) and 423.1(1) . 701\u201418. 8 (422) Auctioneers. 18.8 (1) An auctioneer in making a sale, whether of tangible personal property or realty , is by virtue of this employment making the sale as the agent of the principal. 18.8 (2) Where an auctioneer is conducting a sale and the principal meets the requirement of the casual sale exemption found in Iowa Code section 422.42(12) , the gross receipts from the sale are exempt from the tax. See 1970 O.A.G. 774. 18.8 (3) When an auctioneer is conducting a sale and the principal is in the business of making sales of tangible personal property or taxable services on a recurring basis, the gross receipts from the sale are taxable. 18.8 (4) Where an auctioneer is selling tangible personal property that the auctioneer owns, the sale of the tangible property owned by the auctioneer is taxable. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 422.43 . 701\u201418. 9 (422) Sales by farmers. The sale of grain, livestock or any other farm or garden product by the producer thereof ordinarily constitutes a sale for resale, processing or human consumption and shall not be subject to tax. Farmers selling tangible personal property not otherwise exempt to ultimate consumers or users shall hold a permit and collect and remit sales tax on the gross receipts from their sales. 701\u201418. 10 (422,423) Florists. 18.10 (1) Florists are engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail and shall be liable for payment of tax measured by the receipts from the sale of flowers, wreaths, bouquets, potted plants and other items of tangible personal property . 18.10 (2) When florists conduct transactions through a florists' telephonic delivery association, the following rules shall apply when computing tax liability: a.

In cases where a florist receives an order pursuant to which the florist gives telephonic instructions to a second florist located outside Iowa for delivery to a point outside Iowa, tax is not owing with respect to any receipts which the florist may realize from the transaction. Ch 18, p. 6 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 c. In cases where Iowa florists receive telephonic instructions from other florists located either within or outside of Iowa for the delivery of flowers, the receiving florist will not be held liable for tax with respect to any receipts which the florist may realize from the transaction. d. Rescinded IAB 2/28/96 , ef fective 4/3/96. 18.10 (3) Florists engaged in selling shrubbery , trees, and similar items. See rule 18.1 1 (422,423). This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 422.43 . 701\u201418. 1 1 (422,423) Landscaping materials. The gross receipts from the sale of sod, dirt, trees, shrubbery , bulbs, sand, rock, woodchips and other similar landscaping materials, when used for landscaping and sold to final consumers, shall be subject to sales tax. For the purpose of this rule, \"final consumer\" ordinarily means the owner of the land to which the landscaping materials are applied, or a general building contractor when the landscaping contractor contracts with the general building contractor . When a landscaping contractor uses materials to fulfill a contract, the landscape contractor is considered the retailer of the landscaping materials and shall be obligated to collect sales tax on the selling price from the final consumer . When the retailer of sod, dirt, trees, shrubbery , bulbs, sand, rock, woodchips and other similar landscaping materials installs these items as a part of a contract for landscaping or improving land for a lump sum, the entire gross receipts shall be subject to tax. Any retailer ' s char ges for \"landscaping\" shall be taxable. See rule 701\u201426.62 (422) for a description of this service. However , a retailer ' s char ges for nontaxable services are not taxable if contracted for separately; or , if no written contract exists, the char ges are itemized separately on the invoice. E XAMPLE : A sodding contractor agrees to furnish and install 20 yards of sod for the lump sum of $20.00 per yard. The sodding contractor must char ge the customer $20.00 sales tax (5% x $400.00). E XAMPLE : XYZ Company enters into a contract for the landscaping of an existing of fice building. XYZ Company agrees to furnish shrubs at $25.00 each, white rock for $5.00 per bag and woodchips for $4.00 per bag. XYZ Company also contracts to install all of the landscaping materials for a fee of $25.00 per hour . XYZ Company' s hourly fee is taxable if paid for the service of \"landscaping\" or for some other taxable service, e.g., excavation. If the service is not taxable, the char ge is excluded from tax because it was separately contracted for . The gross receipts from the sale of uncut sod and unexcavated trees, shrubs, and rock shall not be subject to sales or use tax. This is considered a sale of intangible property and not the sale of tangible personal property . This rule does not apply to the gross receipts from the sale of plants and trees which are eligible for purchase with food coupons under rule 701\u201420.1 (422,423). This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code , 422.45(12) and 423.1 . 701\u201418. 12 receipts from the sale of egg-type cockerel chicks, broiler chicks and turkey poults shall be subject to tax. If sale of domestic poultry is for breeding, see rule 701\u201417.9 (422,423). When pullets and poults are sold for production purposes, the receipts from the sales shall be exempt from tax. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 422.42(3) by the state of Iowa, its agencies and instrumentalities. The state of Iowa, its agencies and instrumentalities, are required to collect and remit tax on the gross receipts from taxable retail sales of tangible personal property and taxable services. This rule does not apply to sales made by cities and counties in the state of Iowa which are specifically exempted from collecting tax by Iowa Code section 422.45(20) . This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code chapters 422 and 423 . IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 7 701\u201418. 14 (422,423) Sales of livestock and poultry feeds. T ax shall not apply to the sale of feed for any form of animal life when the product of the animals constitutes food for human consumption. T ax shall apply on feed sold for consumption by pets. Antibiotics, when administered as an additive to feed or drinking water , and vitamins and minerals sold for livestock and poultry shall be exempt from tax. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 422.42(3) and sor orities. Student fraternities and sororities are not considered to be engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail within the meaning of the sales tax law when they provide their members with meals and lodging for which a flat rate or lump sum is char ged. A person engaged in the selling of foods and beverages to such or ganizations for use in the preparation of meals is making exempt sales at retail and shall not be liable for tax if the food purchases would be exempt under rule 701\u201420.1 (422,423). Student fraternities or sororities engaged in the business of serving meals to persons other than members for which separate char ges are made, or owning and operating canteens through which tangible personal property is sold are deemed to be making taxable sales. When student fraternities or sororities do not provide their own meals but are provided by caterers, concessionaires or other persons, such caterers, concessionaires or other persons shall be liable for the collection and remittance of tax with respect to their receipts from meals furnished. A similar liability is attached to persons engaged in the business of operating boarding houses, whether for students or other persons. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 422.42(3) and photostaters. T ax shall apply to the sale of photographs and photostat copies, whether or not produced to the special order of the customer and to char ges for the making of photographs or photostat copies out of materials furnished by the customer . A deduction shall not be allowed for the expenses incurred by the photographer , such as rental of equipment or salaries or wages paid to assistants or models, whether or not the expenses are itemized in billings to customers.

The sale of photographs by a person engaged in the business of making and selling photographs to newspaper or magazine publishers for reproduction shall be taxable. 18.16 (2) Reserved. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 422.42(3) Gravel and stone. When a contract is entered between a contractor and a governmental body and the contract calls for a stockpile delivery along a road to be improved, it is a sale of tangible personal property to the governmental body . T ransactions of this type are exempt from tax. When a contract not only provides for the sale and delivery of materials but also the conversion of the materials into realty improvements, the contractor is the ultimate consumer of the material used and shall be liable for tax. T ax shall apply on the purchase price of the material. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections Sale of ice. The sale of ice for human consumption which may be purchased with food coupons is exempt from tax. The sale of ice used for cooling is subject to tax. See rule 701\u201420.1 (422,423). This rule is intended to implement 701\u201418. 19 (422,423) Antiques, curios, old coins or collector ' s postage stamps. Curios, antiques, art work, coins, collector ' s postage stamps and such articles sold to or by art collectors, philatelists, numismatists and other persons who purchase or sell such items of tangible personal property for use and not primarily for resale are sales at retail and shall be subject to tax. 18.19 (1) Stamps, whether canceled or uncanceled, which are sold by a collector or person engaged in retailing stamps to collectors shall be taxable. 18.19 (2) The distinction between stamps which are purchased by a collector and stamps which are purchased for their value as evidence of the privilege of the owner to have certain mail carried by the United States government is that which determines whether or not a stamp is taxable or not taxable. A stamp becomes an article of tangible personal property having market value when, because of the demand, it can be sold for a price greater than its face value. On the other hand, when a stamp has only face value, as evidence of the right to certain services or an indication that certain revenue has been paid, it shall not be subject to either sales or use tax. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 422.42(3) Communication services. This rule applies to sales of communication services billed prior to November 23, 201 1. For communication service, telecommunication service, ancillary service and other related communication service billed on or after November 23, 201 1, refer to 701\u2014Chapter 224 , Iowa Administrative Code. The gross receipts from the sale of all communication services provided in this state are subject to tax. (Communication services are not subject to use tax prior to July 1, 2001. See rule 701\u201431.7 (423).) 18.20 (1) Definitions. a. Communication service shall mean the act of providing, for a consideration, any medium or method for , or the act of transmission and receipt of, information between two or more points. Each point must be capable of both transmitting and receiving information if \"communication\" is to occur . The term \"communication service\" includes, but is not limited to, the transmission and receipt of sound, printed materials (including letters and materials printed by teletype), other images perceived visually and data encoded in computer languages. Any separate char ge for the service of transmitting and receiving information between automatic data processing equipment and remote facilities shall be subject to tax, see paragraph 18.34(3) \"c.\" b. Communication service is provided \"in this state\" only if both the points of origination and termination of the communication are within the borders of Iowa. Communication service between any other points is \"interstate\" in nature and not subject to tax. c. \"Gross receipts\" from the sale of communication service in this state shall mean all char ges to any person which are necessary for the ultimate user to secure the service, except those char ges which are in the nature of a sale for resale (see subrule 18.20(4) ). Such char ges shall be taxable if the char ges are necessary to secure communication service in this state even though payment of the char ge may also be necessary to secure other services. Any char ge necessary to secure only interstate communication service shall not be subject to tax if the nature of the service is separately stated and the char ge for the service separately billed. For the present, the char ges imposed by the Federal Communications Commission and referred to as \"access char ges for interstate or foreign access services\" to an \"end user\" shall not be subject to tax if separately stated and billed. Char ges imposed or approved by the utilities division of the department of commerce which are necessary to secure long distance service in this state, for example, \"end user intrastate access char ges,\" are taxable. Such char ges are taxable whether they result from an expense incurred from operations or are imposed by the mandate of the utilities division and unrelated to any expense actually incurred in providing the service. If company A collects gross receipts from ultimate users for communication services performed in this state by company B, company A shall treat those gross receipts as its own, collect tax upon them, and remit the tax to the department. The situation is similar to a consignment sale of tangible personal property , and tax must be remitted by the company collecting the gross receipts from the users of the communication services. IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 9 d. Paging services. A one-way paging service is not a taxable enumerated service in Iowa because one-way paging only receives information and is not capable of transmitting information. As a result, this type of pager service is not a two-way transmission. 18.20 (2) This subrule is applicable to various specific circumstances involving the sale of communication services. a. Companies which bill their subscribers for communication services on a quarterly , semiannual, annual or any other periodic basis shall include the amount of such billings in their gross receipts. The date of the billing shall determine the period for which sales tax shall be remitted. Thus, if the date of a billing is March 31, and the due date for payment of the bill without penalty is April 20, tax upon the gross receipts contained in the bill shall be included in the sales tax return for the first quarter of the year . The same principle shall be used to determine when tax will be included in payment of a sales tax deposit to the department. b. The gross receipts from the service of transmitting messages, night letters, day letters and all other messages of similar nature between two or more points within this state are subject to sales tax. c. Receipts from communication services performed for all divisions, boards, commissions, agencies or instrumentalities of federal, Iowa, county or municipal government, and private, nonprofit educational institutions in this state for educational purposes are exempt from tax, except sales to any tax-levying body used by or in connection with the operation of any municipally owned utility engaged in selling gas, electricity or heat to the general public are subject to tax. 18.20 (3) This subrule is specifically applicable to companies and other persons providing telephone service in this state. Any reasoning contained in this subrule may also be applied to companies or other persons providing other communication services. a. All companies must have a permit for each business of fice which provides communication service in this state. The companies must collect and remit tax upon the gross receipts from the operation of such of fices. b. If a minimum amount is guaranteed to a company from the operation of any coin-operated telephone, tax shall be computed on the minimum amount guaranteed or the actual taxable gross receipts collected whichever is the greater . c. In computing tax due, the federal taxes identified as such, separately billed and payable by the customer shall be excluded from gross receipts. If the taxes are not separately billed, they shall be subject to Iowa sales tax. d. T elegrams and like char ges made to the accounts of subscribers and billed by companies providing telephone service which appear on the subscribers' toll bills are subject to tax. e. Char ges for directory assistance service rendered in this state shall be subject to tax. Char ges for directory assistance service, separately stated and billed, shall not be subject to tax if the service is interstate in nature. f. The gross receipts from the installation or repair of any inside wire which provides electrical current that allows an electronics device to function shall be subject to tax. Such gross receipts are from the enumerated service of electrical repair or installation, and are thus subject to tax. The gross receipts from \"inside wire maintenance char ges\" for services performed under a service or warranty contract shall also be subject to tax. Depending on circumstances, such receipts are for the enumerated service of \"electrical repair\" or are incurred under an \"optional service or warranty contract\" for an enumerated service. In either event, the receipts are subject to tax. See rule 701\u201418.25 (422,423). g. The gross receipts from the rental of any device for home or of fice use or to provide a communication service to others shall be fully taxable; such receipts are for the enumerated service of \"rental of tangible personal property .\" The gross receipts from rental include rents, royalties, and copyright and license fees. Any periodic fee for maintenance of the device which is included in the gross receipts for the rental of the device shall also be subject to tax. h. The sale of any device, new or used, in place at the time of sale on the customer ' s premises or sold to the customer elsewhere is the sale of tangible personal property , and thus a sale subject to tax. The sale of an entire inventory of devices may or may not be subject to tax, depending upon whether it does Ch 18, p. 10 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 or does not come within the purview of the casual sales exemption, see Iowa Code section 422.42(2) and subrule 18.28(3) . Other exemptions may be applicable as well. See Iowa Code section 422.45 and 701\u2014Chapter 17 . i. The gross receipts for the repair or installation of inside wire or the repair or installation of any electronic device, including a telephone or telephone switching equipment shall, as a general rule, be subject to tax whether the customer or purchaser is billed by way of a flat fee or flat hourly char ge covering all costs including labor and materials, or by way of a premises visit or trip char ge, or by a single char ge covering and not distinguishing between char ges for labor and materials, or is billed by a char ge with labor and material segregated, or is billed for labor only . An exception is this: If the gross receipts are for services on or in connection with new construction, reconstruction, alteration, expansion or remodeling of a building or structure, the gross receipts shall not be subject to tax. For further information concerning the conditions under which such gross receipts for repair or installation would not be subject to tax, see rule 701\u201419.1 (422,423) and 701\u2014subrule 26.2(1) . j. If a company bills a handling char ge to a customer for sending the customer an electronic device by mail or by a delivery service, this char ge shall constitute a part of the gross receipts from the sale of the device and shall be subject to tax. The gross receipts of a mandatory service rendered in connection with the sale of tangible personal property are considered by the department to be a part of the gross receipts from the sale of the property itself and thus subject to tax. k. The purchase or rental of tangible personal property by companies providing communication services shall be subject to tax. l. The amount of any deposit paid by a customer to a company providing communication service if returned to the customer shall not be subject to tax.

On and after July 1, 1998, if an optional service or warranty contract is a computer software maintenance or support service contract and the contract provides for the furnishing of technical support services only and not for the furnishing of any materials, then no tax is imposed on the furnishing of those services under this subrule. If a computer software maintenance or support service contract provides for the performance of nontaxable services and the taxable transfer of tangible personal property , and no separate fee is stated for either the performance of the service or the transfer of the property , then state sales tax of 5 percent shall be imposed on 50 percent of the gross receipts from the sale of the contract. If a char ge for the performance of the nontaxable service is separately stated, see subrule 18.25(5) below . 18.25 (4) A preventive maintenance contract is a contract which requires only the visual inspection of equipment and no repair is or shall be included. The gross receipts from the sale of a preventive maintenance contract is not subject to tax. IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 19 18.25 (5) Additional char ges for parts and labor furnished in addition to that covered by a warranty or maintenance contract which are for enumerated taxable services shall be subject to tax. Only parts and not labor will be subject to tax where a nontaxable service is performed if the labor char ge is separately stated. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 422.42 and 423.2 and Iowa Code Supplement section 422.43 as amended by 1998 Iowa Acts, Senate File 2288 . 701\u201418. 26 (422) Service charge and gratuity . When the purchase of any food, beverage or meals automatically and invariably results in the inclusion of a mandatory service char ge to the total price for such food, beverage or meal, the amounts so included shall be subject to tax. The term \"service char ge\" means either a fixed percentage of the total price of or a char ge for food, beverage or meal. The mandatory service char ge shall be considered: (1) a required part of a transaction arising from a taxable sale and a contractual obligation of a purchaser to pay to a vendor arising directly from and as a condition of the making of the sale and (2) a fixed labor cost included in the price for food, beverage or meal even though such char ge is separately stated from the char ge for the food, beverage or meal. When a gratuity is voluntarily given for food, beverage or meal it shall be considered a tip and not subject to tax. Cohen v . Playboy Club International, Inc., 19 Ill. App. 3d 215, 31 1 N.E.2d 336; Baltimor e Country Club, Inc. v . Comptr oller of T r easury , 272 Md. 65, 321 A.2d 308. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 422.43 . 701\u201418. 27 (422) Advertising agencies, commer cial artists, and designers. 18.27 (1) Nontaxable services. T ax does not apply to char ges by advertising agencies, commercial artists, or designers for services rendered that do not represent services that are a part of a sale of tangible personal property , or a labor or service cost in the production of tangible personal property . Examples of such nontaxable services are: writing original manuscripts and news releases; writing copy for use in newspapers, magazines, or other advertising, or to be broadcast on television or radio, compiling statistical and other information; placing or arranging for the placing of advertising in media, such as newspapers, magazines, or other publications; billboards and other facilities used in public transportation; and delivering or causing the delivery of brochures, pamphlets, cards, and similar items. Char ges for such items as supervision, consultation, research, postage, express, transportation and travel expense, if involved in the rendering of such services, are likewise not taxable. 18.27 (2) Agency fee or commission. When an amount billed as an agency \"fee,\" \"service char ge,\" or \"commission\" represents a char ge or part of the char ge for any of the nontaxable services described under 18.27(1) , the amount so billed is not taxable. Such char ge by an advertising agency will be considered to be made for nontaxable services. 18.27 (3) Items taxable. The tax applies to the entire amount char ged to clients for items of tangible personal property such as drawings, paintings, designs, photographs, lettering, assemblies and printed matter . This includes the cost of typography and reproduction proofs when the latter is used as part of a paste-up, \"mechanical\" or assembly . Whether the items of property are used for reproduction or display purposes is immaterial. 18.27 (4) Pr eliminary art. \"Preliminary means roughs, visualizations, comprehensives and layouts prepared for acceptance by clients before a contract is entered into or approval is given for finished art. (\"Finished art\" as used herein means the final art used for actual reproduction by photo-mechanical or other processes.) T ax does not apply to separate char ges for preliminary art, except where the preliminary art becomes physically incorporated into the finished art as for example, when the finished art is made by inking directly over a pencil sketch or drawing, or the approved layout is used as camera copy for reproduction. The char ge for preliminary art must be billed separately to the client, either on a separate billing or separately char ged for on the billing for the finished art. It must be clearly identified on the billing as preliminary art, of one or more of the types mentioned in the preceding paragraph. Proof of ordering or Ch 18, p. 20 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 producing the preliminary art prior to date of contract or approval for finished art shall be evidenced by purchase orders of the buyer , or by work orders or other records of the seller . The following situations are examples of when the sale of \"finished art\" is taxable: a. Finished art which is sold to customers to be used for advertising purposes in newspapers, magazines or the like. After the advertiser contracts with the ad agency for the development of an advertising message or theme, the agency devises ideas (preliminary art) and produces the finished art. The finished art is then delivered to the advertiser or to an agent of the advertiser such as a printer or publisher who is under contract with the advertiser to publish the ad. b. Finished art which is sold to customers, or their agents (e.g., printers), for use in producing printed material. The char ge for finished art is taxable even though the art work may later be returned to the ad agency by the purchaser or the printer or used by the customer or the customer ' s agent to produce a nontaxable item. Since the finished art is not a part of the printed materials, the ad agency' s customer is consuming the material and not buying it for resale, or using it in an exempt manner . c. Finished art which is used to produce other tangible personal property sold by the ad agency such as letterhead stationery and business cards. The char ge for such art is taxable as part of the selling price for such stationery or business cards. This is true whether or not the agency separately itemizes the char ge for such stationery or business cards. 18.27 (5) Items pur chased by agency , artist or designer . An advertising agency , artist, or designer is the consumer of tangible personal property used in the operation of its business, such as stationery , ink, paint, tools, drawing tables, T -squares, pens, pencils, and other of fice supplies. T ax applies to the sale of such property to the agency , artist, or designer . T ax also applies where the agency , artist or designer is the consumer of taxable services. The agency , artist, or designer is the seller of, and may purchase for resale, any item resold before use, or that becomes physically an ingredient or component part of tangible personal property sold, as, for example, illustration board, paint, ink, rubber cement, flap paper , wrapping paper , photographs, photostats, or art purchased from other artists. T ax also applies where the agency , artist, or designer is the seller at retail of taxable services. In the event that an agency , artist, or designer is both a consumer and a retailer of such items of tangible personal property as noted in this subsection, such agency , artist or designer should: a. Purchase such items without tax liability if the majority of the items are sold at retail and remit the tax at the time of resale or at the time such items are consumed in the operation of the business. b. Pay tax to suppliers at the time of purchase if the majority of the items will be consumed in the operation of the business and deduct the original cost of any such items subsequently sold at retail when reporting tax on their returns. 18.27 (6) Construction. Nothing contained in this rule shall be construed to provide for an exemption from tax for services expressly taxable in rules 701\u201426.17 (422) and 26.39 (422). 18.27 (7) Advertising agencies, commer cial artists and designers as agent of client or as a nonagent. a. In general. A true agent relationship depends upon the facts with respect to each transaction. An agent is one who represents another , called the principal, in dealings with third persons. Advertising agencies, commercial artists, and designers may act as agents on behalf of their clients in dealing with third persons or they may act on their own behalf. T o the extent advertising agencies, artists and designers act as agents of their clients in acquiring tangible personal property , they are neither purchasers of the property with respect to the supplier nor sellers of the property with respect to their principals. b. When advertising agencies, commercial artists, and designers act as agents of their clients in purchasing property for their clients, the tax applies to the gross receipts from the sale of such property to the advertising agencies, commercial artists, and designers. Unless such advertising agencies, commercial artists and designers act as true agents, they will be regarded as the retailers of tangible personal property furnished to their clients and the tax will apply to the total amount received for such property . Further , nothing in this rule should be construed to be in variance with the opinion of the Iowa Supreme Court in Rowe vs. Iowa State T ax Commission, 249 Iowa 1207, 91 N.W .2d 548 (1958). IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 21 c. T o establish that a particular acquisition is made in the capacity of an agent for a client, advertising agencies, commercial artists, and designers (collectively herein referred to as agency) shall act as follows: 1. The agency must clearly disclose to the supplier the name of the client for whom the agency is acting as an agent. 2. The agency must obtain, prior to the acquisition, and retain written evidence of agent status with the client. 3. The price billed to the client, exclusive of any agency fee, must be the same as the amount paid to the supplier . The agency may make no use of the property for its own account, such as commingling the property of a client with another , and the reimbursement for the property should be separately invoiced or shown separately on the invoice to the client. d. Some char ges may represent reimbursement for tangible personal property acquired by the agency as agents for its clients and compensation for performing of agency services related thereto. When an advertising agency , commercial artist, or designer establishes that it has acquired tangible personal property as agents for its clients, tax does not apply to the char ge made by the agency to its client for reimbursement char ges by a supplier or to the char ges made for the performance of the agency' s services directly related to the acquisition of personal property . e. Advertising agencies, commercial artists, and designers acting as agents shall not issue resale certificates to suppliers. f. Advertising agencies, commercial artists, and designers act as retailers of all items of tangible personal property produced or fabricated by their own employees when they sell to their clients. Advertising agencies, commercial artists, and designers are not agents of their clients with respect to the acquisition of materials incorporated into items of tangible personal property prepared by their employees and sold at retail to their clients. 18.27 (8) Scope. The scope of this rule is not confined simply to advertising agencies, commercial artists and designers, but also applies to all other businesses whose activities would bring them within the scope of this rule (e.g., printers). This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 422.43 and 423.2 . 701\u201418. 28 (422,423) Casual sales. 18.28 (1) Casual sales by persons not r etailers or by r etailers outside the r egular course of business. Casual sales are exempt from the Iowa sales and use taxes except for the casual sale of vehicles subject to registration, and vehicles subject only to the issuance of a certificate of title. On and after July 1, 1988, the casual sale of aircraft is also taxable. In order for a casual sale to qualify for exemption under this subrule, two conditions must be present: (1) the sale of tangible personal property or taxable services must be of a nonrecurring nature, and (2) the seller , at the time of the sale, must not be engaged for profit in the business of selling tangible goods or services taxed under Iowa Code section 422.43 or , if so engaged, the sale must be outside the regular course of the seller ' s business (Order of State Board of T ax Review , Martin Development Corporation, Docket No. 136, December 1, 1976, incorporating by reference Order of Department of Revenue Hearing Of ficer in Docket No. 75-28-6A-A, July 9, 1976). See subrule 18.28(2) for an explanation of the casual sale exemption applicable to the liquidation of a trade or business. If either of the conditions above are lacking, no casual sale occurs. Moreover , prior to July 1, 1985, the casual sale exemption was limited to sales of tangible personal property , and casual enumerated taxable services did not qualify for the exemption. KTV O, Inc. v . Bair , Equity No. 385 Linn County District Court, September 5, 1975. For the purposes of this subrule, the word \"aircraft\" refers to any contrivance now known or hereafter invented, which is designed or used for navigation of or flight in the air , for the purpose of transporting persons, property , or both or for crop dusting, aerial surveillance, recreational flying, or for providing some other service. By way of nonexclusive example, balloons, gliders, helicopters, and \"ultra lights\" are aircraft. Also included within the meaning of the word \"aircraft\" is any craft registered under Iowa Code section 328.20 or any successor statute thereto. Ch 18, p. 22 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 Sales of capital assets such as equipment, machinery , and furnishings which are not sold as inventory shall be deemed outside the regular course of business (including sales of capital assets during a retailer ' s liquidation) and the casual sales exemption shall apply as long as such sales are nonrecurring. This will include transactions exempted from state and federal income tax under Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code. T wo separate selling events outside the regular course of business within a 12-month period shall be considered nonrecurring. Three such separate selling events within a 12-month period shall be considered as recurring. T ax shall only apply commencing with the third separate selling event. However , in the event that a sale event occurs consistently over a span of years, such sale is recurring and not casual, even though only one sales event occurs each year . Des Moines Police Department v . Bair , Equity No. CE3-1591, Polk County District Court, November 1, 1976. E XAMPLE : Corporation A sells the company copy machine at retail to B. At the time of this sale, Corporation A is engaged in the business for profit of selling clothes at retail. Assuming that the sale of the copy machine constitutes a sale of a nonrecurring nature, there is a casual sale because the sale is outside the regular course of Corporation A ' s business. E XAMPLE : Corporation C is engaged in the business of lending money secured by collateral. In the course of such business, Corporation C must repossess some collateral and sell it at retail for purposes of payment of loans. Such sales recur from time to time. Notwithstanding that Corporation C is presumably not engaged in the business of selling tangible goods or services for a profit, since the sales are recurring, there is no casual sale. S & M Finance Co., Fort Dodge v . Iowa State T ax Commission, 1968, Iowa 162 N.W .2d 505. E XAMPLE : F , a farmer , does not sell tangible personal property at retail or engage in the performance of any taxable services. F liquidates the farming business and hires a professional auctioneer to auction of f many items of tangible personal property . Assuming this liquidation event is casual, all items sold by the auctioneer at retail are casual sales notwithstanding that many dif ferent sales to numerous dif ferent buyers may occur . See rule 18.8(422). E XAMPLE : H, an insurance agency , holds a semiannual event to sell its used of fice furniture. Even though H does not regularly sell tangible personal property at retail, the casual sale exemption does not apply because the selling events are recurring. Des Moines Police Department v . Bair , Equity No. CE3-1591, Polk County District Court, November 1, 1976. E XAMPLE : I, a corporation, has one sales event every year whereby it auctions of f capital assets which it has no use for or desires to replace. This event has been a planned function of I and is conducted regularly and consistently over a span of years. Even though this sale event occurs only once a year , it is of a recurring nature because of the pattern of repetitiveness present and, therefore, the casual sale exemption would not apply , regardless of the number of items sold at such sale event each year . E XAMPLE : J, a corporation engaged in the sale for resale of tangible personal property , sells three capital assets used in J' s trade or business consisting of a copy machine, a desk, and a computer . Each sale is made to dif ferent buyers and is unrelated to the other sales. The three sales occur in January , June, and October of the same year . The sale made in October consists of a desk. J has not established a pattern of recurring sales of capital assets prior to aforementioned sales of capital assets. Under these circumstances, the sale of the desk is not a casual sale, but the sales of the copy machine and the computer are casual and exempt. E XAMPLE : K, a corporation, is primarily engaged in the business of road construction. From time to time, it sells used capital assets and scrap materials reclaimed from its road construction work to individuals and businesses. It does not advertise itself as a retailer of these assets and materials but sells them as a matter of courtesy to persons who cannot purchase them elsewhere. After 42 years of operation, it decides to liquidate. Pursuant to that decision, K employs two auctioneers to sell its capital assets and ceases operation after its assets are sold. K had only one capital asset sale during the 12 months immediately preceding each liquidation auction sale. The auction sales are exempt casual sales under this subrule (1) because they are nonrecurring, and (2) because K is not a retailer of the capital assets sold during its liquidation. See Holland Br os. Construction Co., Inc. v . Iowa State Boar d of T ax Review , 61 1 N.W .2d 495 (Iowa 2000). IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 23 E XAMPLE : L, a sole proprietorship, engaged in selling automobile parts at retail, incorporated. The assets of L are sold to the new corporation in exchange for stock and the new corporation now engages in selling automobile parts at retail. The casual sale exemption would apply , but only because of the exemption set out in subrule 18.28(2) infra, since the transfer involves a liquidation of L ' s business and the sale of L ' s inventory to another person (the corporatin) which will continue to engage in a similar trade or business. The above examples are not the only ones pertaining to the questions of whether a casual sale did or did not occur . However , because of the myriad of factual situations which can and do exist, it is not possible to formulate more detailed rules on this subject matter . 18.28 (2) Special rules for casual sales involving the liquidation of a trade or business. When retailers sell all or substantially all of the tangible personal property held or used in the course of the trade or business for which retailers are required to hold a sales tax permit, the casual sale exemption will apply to exempt those sales only when the following circumstances exist: (1) the trade or business must be transferred to another person, and (2) the transferee must engage in a similar trade or business. The trade or business transferred refers to the place where the business is located since each taxable retail business must have a sales tax permit at each location. For purposes of this casual sale circumstance, it is irrelevant whether the retailer actually has a sales tax permit or not; rather , the relevant circumstance is that the retailer was required to have a sales tax permit. See Holland Br os. Construction Co., Inc. v . Iowa State Boar d of T ax Review , 61 1 N.W .2d 495 (Iowa 2000). One ef fect of this is that a retailer who is closing as opposed to transferring a business and is selling inventory in the process of this closing is not entitled to claim the casual sale exemption under this subrule, but see subrule 18.28(1) , and the resale exemption is always potentially applicable to sales of inventory . See the examples below for further explanation. E XAMPLE : L, a hardware store, desires to liquidate the business. L had been selling tangible personal property at retail and was required to have an Iowa retail sales tax permit. L hires a professional auctioneer and all items of inventory , equipment, and fixtures are sold to various purchasers. These items consist of all or substantially all of the tangible personal property held or used by L in the course of the business for which a sales tax permit was required to be held. L, however , does not transfer the trade or business to anyone else. Under these circumstances, the casual sales exemption does not apply to the sale of the inventory , but see subrule 18.28(1) for criteria which determine whether the casual sales exemption applies to the equipment and fixtures. E XAMPLE : The facts are the same as those in the previous example, except that L is liquidating its business because it attempted to build a new store and its entire inventory was destroyed by fire while in storage. An auctioneer sells L ' s equipment and trade fixtures to various purchasers. The auctioneer ' s sale of the equipment and trade fixtures is an exempt casual sale of the type described in subrule 18.28(1) because (1) it is nonrecurring, and (2) it is outside the usual course of L ' s business. See Holland Br os. Construction Co., Inc., supra. E XAMPLE : M, a sole proprietorship, incorporated. The assets of M are sold to the new corporation for stock. The new corporation engaged in a similar business. The casual sale exemption would apply . E XAMPLE : N, an oil company , sells all or substantially all of the tangible personal property of ten company-owned service stations which were held or used in the course of its business, for which N was required to hold a sales tax permit, by bulk sales or otherwise. The sales were made to O, P , and Q and occurred at dif ferent times during the same year , each sale being unrelated. N was required to have a sales tax permit for each service station. N transferred its trade or business (each service station) to O, P , and Q, each of whom will engage in the same business N did, i.e., operation of service stations. Even though under these circumstances, the sales by N are recurring, the casual sales exemption would apply since each trade or business was transferred to another person who did engage in a similar trade or business. E XAMPLE : R, an operator of a restaurant, auctions of f to various purchasers who are not engaged in the restaurant business all or substantially all of the tangible personal property held or used in the business for which R was required to hold a retail sales tax permit. R transfers the trade or business to S who then operates a restaurant at the same location R did. Even if S did not purchase any of the tangible Ch 18, p. 24 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 personal property , under these circumstances, the casual sales exemption applies. The tangible personal property held or used in the trade or business need not be sold to the same person to whom the trade or business is sold for the exemption to apply . E XAMPLE : T , a restaurant, sells all of its tangible personal property held or used in the course of its business for which it was required to hold a sales tax permit to U. T also sells its trade or business to U. U engages in the business of operation of a dance hall and does not continue to operate the restaurant. This subrule' s casual sales exemption will not apply , but see subrule 18.28(1) for the criteria of a casual sale exemption which could apply . The above examples are not the only ones pertaining to the questions of whether a casual sale did or did not occur . However , because of the myriad of factual situations which can and do exist, it is not possible to formulate more detailed rules on this subject matter . 18.28 (3) Casual sales of services. Special rule for services rendered, furnished, or performed on or after July 1, 1985. The \"casual sale\" of an enumerated service has occurred if the following circumstances exist: a. The service was rendered, furnished, or performed on or after July 1, 1985; and b. The service was rendered, furnished, or performed on a nonrecurring basis by a seller who, at the time of the sale of the service, is not engaged for profit in the business of selling tangible goods or services taxed under Iowa Code section 422.43 , or , if so engaged, the sale was outside the regular course of the seller ' s business; or c. The sales of all, or substantially all of the services held or used by a retailer in the course of the retailer ' s trade or business for which the retailer is required to hold a sales tax permit, if the retailer sells or otherwise transfers the trade or business to another person who engages in a similar trade or business. E XAMPLE : V ordinarily engages in janitorial and building maintenance or cleaning which are taxable services; see rule 701\u201426.60(422). Once, as a favor to customer W , V cut customer W' s lawn and otherwise performed the taxable service of \"lawn care\" for customer W . Since this performance of lawn care was not \"within V' s regular course of business\" and was not \"recurring,\" gross receipts from the lawn care are not subject to tax. E XAMPLE : Corporation X rents a piece of equipment from Y . Y does not otherwise rent equipment and does not engage in the business for profit of selling tangible goods or taxable enumerated services. A casual sale qualifying for the exemption exists. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 422.42(12) , 422.45(6) and 423.4 . 701\u201418. 29 (422,423) Pr ocessing, a definition of the word, its beginning and completion characterized with specific examples of pr ocessing. 18.29 (1) Pr ocessing\u2014a definition. For the purpose of these rules, \"processing\" means an operation or a series of operations whereby tangible personal property is subjected to some special treatment by artificial or natural means which changes its form, context, or condition, and results in marketable tangible personal property . These operations are commonly associated with fabricating, compounding, germinating, or manufacturing. Linwood Stone Pr oducts Co. v . State Department of Revenue, 175 N.W .2d 393 (Iowa 1970). 18.29 (2) The beginning of pr ocessing. Processing begins when the \"form, context, or condition\" of tangible personal property is changed with the intent of eventually transforming the property into a saleable finished product. The severance of raw material from real estate is not processing, even if this severance results in a change in the form, context, or condition of the real estate. Linwood Stone Pr oducts Co. v . State Department of Revenue, 175 N. W .2d 393 (Iowa 1970). Furthermore, transportation of raw material after it is severed from real estate but prior to the time the initial change in the form, context, or condition of the raw material occurs is not processing. Southern Sioux County Rural W ater System, Inc. v . Iowa Department of Revenue, 383 N.W .2d 585 (Iowa 1986). 18.29 (3) The completion of pr ocessing. Processing ends when the property being processed is in the form in which it is ultimately intended to be sold at retail, Hy-V ee Food Stor es v . Iowa Department of Revenue, 379 N.W .2d 37 (Iowa App. 1985). The storage or transport of property after that property is transformed into a finished product is not a part of processing. IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 25 18.29 (4) Examples of when pr ocessing begins and ends. The following examples are intended to clarify but not to contradict the explanation of processing set out in subrules 18.29(2) and 18.29(3) . E XAMPLE A: A company blasts limestone from the ground, bulldozers pick the limestone up and put it in trucks; these trucks transport the limestone to a crusher some distance from the quarry site. The first change in the \"form\" or \"condition\" of the limestone, while it is tangible personal property , occurs when the stone is crushed in the crusher . The blasting of the stone from the ground and its transport to the crusher would be acts preparatory to and not a part of processing. Thus, fuel used in the bulldozers and transport trucks would not be fuel used in processing, Linwood Stone Pr oducts, supra. E XAMPLE B: Pumps remove water from under ground wells and pump that water through pipes to a water treatment plant. At the treatment plant, the water passes initially through an aeration system which adds oxygen to it. At other points in the plant, potassium and chlorine are added to the water and iron is removed. After these acts are performed, clean, drinkable water exists. The first change, however , in the condition of the water occurs when it passes through the aeration system and oxygen is added to it. The withdrawal of the water from the ground and its transport to the aeration system would not be a part of processing. Thus, electricity used by the pumps which pump the water to the aeration system would not be used in processing. However , by way of contrast, electricity used to transport the water between, for example, the aeration system and the point where potassium is added to the water would be used in processing. Southern Sioux Rural W ater System, Inc., supra. E XAMPLE C: W ater is processed in a treatment plant. The last act at the plant necessary to render the water drinkable or a \"finished product\" is the addition of chlorine. After the addition of chlorine, the water is pumped first into wells and later into water towers where it is held for distribution. The pumping of this drinkable water from the point where the chlorine is added to the wells and the tower is not a part of processing because processing of the water ended with the addition of the chlorine; thus, electricity used in these pumps is not electricity used in processing. Southern Sioux County Rural W ater System, Inc., supra. 18.29 (5) Integral part of the pr oduction of the pr oduct test. Certain activities may be exempt as part of processing if those activities are very closely interconnected with, or an integral part of, the operation of the processing equipment while processing is occurring. Southern Sioux Rural W ater System, Inc., supra. Merely because an activity is vital or essential to a processing operation does not make that activity exempt as part of processing unless the activity itself is closely interconnected with, or an integral part of, the operation of the processing equipment while processing is occurring. Mississippi V alley Milk Pr oducers Ass'n v . Iowa Dept. of Revenue, 387 N.W .2d 61 1 (Iowa App. 1986). See the nonexclusive example below . A manufactures nails. In A ' s factory is a machine which draws steel into long rods the width of whatever nail A may wish to manufacture. After this machine draws the steel into the desired-size rods, the rods are moved to a second machine by a conveyor belt. This second machine cuts the rods into the length of nail which A desires. A second conveyor belt then transports these cut rods to a third machine which sharpens one end of the rod to a point and puts a \"nail head\" on the other end of the rod. The activities of the three machines are clearly processing, in that they are activities which change the form, context or condition of raw material, and as a result of those activities, marketable tangible personal property or a finished product is created. The two conveyor belts move the partially finished nails from one piece of processing equipment to another while processing is occurring. Since the activities of the conveyors are very closely interconnected with and an integral part of the operation of the various pieces of processing equipment while processing is occurring, the conveyor belts are involved in processing as well. 18.29 (6) Other specific examples of pr ocessing. The Iowa Supreme Court has also stated that the following activities are processing: manufacturing ice, refrigerating cheese to age it from \"green\" to edible, refrigerating eggs to change their flavor , pasteurizing and subsequent refrigeration of milk, \"hard\" freezing of meat and butter for aging, canning vegetables and cooking foodstuf fs; Fischer Artificial Ice & Cold Storage Co. v . Iowa State T ax Commission, 248 Iowa 497, 81 N.W .2d 437 (1957); and, Mississippi V alley Milk Pr oducers v . Iowa Dept. of Revenue and Finance, 387 N.W .2d 61 1 (Ia. App. 1986), also crushing of \"flat rock\" limestone and treating limestone in kilns. Linwood Stone Pr oducts Co. v . State Ch 18, p. 26 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 Dept. of Revenue, 175 N.W .2d 393 (Iowa 1970). See 701\u2014subrule 17.3(2) for an expanded definition of processing with regard to food manufacturing. 18.29 (7) Other department rules concerned with pr ocessing. V arious sections of the Iowa Code set out activities that are defined by statute to be \"processing.\" The rules interpreting these statutes for the purposes of sales and use tax law are the following: a. 701\u201415.3 (422,423) Exemption certificates, direct pay permits, fuel used in processing, and beer and wine wholesalers. b. 701\u201417.2 (422) Fuel used in processing\u2014when exempt. c. 701\u201417.3 (422,423) Processing exemptions. d. 701\u201417.9 (422,423) Sales of breeding livestock, fowl, and certain other property used in agricultural production.

Retail sales of tangible personal property made on a recognized settlement or reservation to Indians who are members of the tribe located on that settlement or reservation, where delivery occurs on the reservation, are exempt from tax (Bryan v . Itasca County , 425 U.S. 463, 475-81 (1976)). Retail sales of tangible personal property made on a recognized settlement or reservation to Indians where delivery occurs of f the reservation are subject to tax. Retail sales of tangible personal property made to non-Indians on a recognized settlement or reservation are subject to tax regardless of where the delivery occurs. Sales made to non-Indians are taxable even though the seller may be a member of a recognized settlement or reservation. 18.30 (3) Retail sales tax\u2014services. Sales of enumerated taxable services and sales made by municipal corporations furnishing gas, electricity , water , heat, or communication services to Indians who are members of the tribe located on the recognized settlement or reservation where delivery of the service occurs are exempt from tax (Bryan v .

Sales of enumerated taxable services or sales made by municipal corporations furnishing gas, electricity , water , heat, or IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 27 communication services to Indians where delivery of the services occurs of f a recognized settlement or reservation are subject to tax. 18.30 (4) Off-r eservation pur chases. Purchases made by Indians of f a recognized settlement or reservation are subject to tax if delivery occurs of f the reservation. Purchases made by Indians of f a recognized settlement or reservation are not subject to tax if delivery is made on the reservation to Indians who are members of the tribe located on that reservation. See rule 701\u201433.5 (423) for the taxation of tangible personal property and services where the state use tax may be applicable. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 422.42 , personal pr operty pur chased by one who is engaged in the performance of a service. 18.31 (1) In general. (Effective July 1, 1990) a. On and after July 1, 1990, tangible personal property purchased by one who is engaged in the performance of a service is purchased for resale and not subject to tax if (1) the provider and user of the service intend that a sale of the property will occur , and (2) the property is transferred to the user of the service in connection with the performance of the service in a form or quantity capable of a fixed or definite price value, and (3) the sale is evidenced by a separate char ge for the identifiable piece or quantity of property . b. Prior to July 1, 1990, in those circumstances in which tangible personal property is purchased by one who is engaged in the performance of a service and the property is transferred to the customer in conjunction with a performance of the service in a form or quantity which is capable of any fixed or definite price value, but the actual sale of the property is not indicated by a separate char ge for the identifiable item, the burden of proving that the property was purchased for resale by one engaged in the performance of a service and not subject to tax at the time of purchase is upon the person engaged in the performance of a service who asserts this. c. T angible personal property which is not sold in the manner set forth in \"a\" or \"b\" above is not purchased for resale and thus is subject to tax at the time of purchase by one engaged in the performance of a service. Such tangible personal property is considered to be consumed by the purchaser who is engaged in the performance of a service and the person performing the service shall pay tax upon the sale at the time of purchase. E XAMPLE : An investment counselor purchases envelopes. These envelopes are used to send out monthly reports to the investment counselor ' s clients regarding their accounts. T ax is due at the time the investment counselor purchases the envelopes if the clients are not billed for these items. Each envelope is transferred to a client in a form or quantity which is capable of a fixed or definite price value. However , there must also be an actual sale to the client (customer) of an item of personal property in order that there be a \"resale\" of the item. An automobile repair shop purchases solvents which are used in cleaning automobile parts and thus in performing its automobile repair service. T ax is due at the time the automobile repair shop purchases the solvent since the solvents are not sold to the customer and, in this case, the item is not transferred to a customer in a form or quantity which is capable of a fixed or definite price value. Thus, the solvent is deemed consumed by the purchaser engaged in the performance of the service. E XAMPLE : A retailer purchases television tubes tax-free where the retailer makes a separate char ge for the tube to the customer and since the tube is transferred to the customer in a form or quantity capable of a fixed or definite price value. E XAMPLE : A beauty or barber shop purchases shampoo and other items to be used in the performance of its service. T ax is due at the time the beauty or barber shop purchases such items from its supplier , where the customers of the beauty or barber shop are not separately billed for the item, and because it is not transferred to the customer in a form or quantity capable of a fixed or definite price value, it is being consumed by the beauty or barber shop. E XAMPLE : A car wash purchases water , electricity , or gas used in the washing of a car . The car wash would be the consumer of the water , electricity , or gas and tax is due at the time of purchase. The items Ch 18, p. 28 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 purchased by the car wash are not transferred to the customer in a form or quantity capable of a fixed or definite price value, and the customer is not billed for the item. E XAMPLE : An accounting firm purchases plastic binders which are used to cover the reports issued to its customers. These binders would be subject to tax at the time of purchase by the firm where the customer of the firm is not billed for the item, there being no sale to the customer in such a case. E XAMPLE : A meat locker purchases materials such as wrapping paper and tape which it uses to wrap meat for customers who provide the locker with the meat. These materials would be subject to tax at the time of purchase by the meat locker because they are not sold to the customer in a form or quantity capable of a fixed or definite price value. E XAMPLE : A jeweler purchases materials such as main springs and crystals to be used in the performance of a service. These items are purchased by the jeweler for resale where they are transferred to the customer in a form or quantity capable of a fixed or definite price value and each item is actually sold to the customer as evidenced by a separate char ge therefor . E XAMPLE : A lawn care service applies fertilizer , herbicides, and pesticides to its customers' lawns. The following are examples of invoices to customers which are suitable to indicate a lawn care service' s purchase of the fertilizer , herbicides, and pesticides for resale to those customers: \"Chemicals...31 \"Fertilizer ...50 lbs....$100\"; and \"Materials applied to lawn...4 bushel...$40\". The following are examples of information placed upon an invoice which would not indicate a purchase for resale to the customers invoiced: \"Fifty percent of the char ge for this service is for materials placed on a lawn,\" or \"Lawn chemicals...$30\" or \"Fifty pounds of fertilizer was applied to this lawn.\" 18.31 (2) Pur chases made by automobile body shops or garages with body shops (effective October 1, 1980). T angible personal property purchased by body shops can be purchased for resale provided both of the following conditions are met: 1. The property purchased for resale is actually transferred to the body shop' s customer by becoming an ingredient or component part of the repair work. See Iowa Code section 422.42(2) and Cedar V alley Leasing Inc. v . Iowa Department of Revenue, 274 N.W .2d 357 (Iowa 1979). 2. The property purchased for resale is itemized as a separate item on the invoice to the body shop' s customer and is transferred to the customer in a form or quantity capable of a fixed or definite price value. If either of the above two events is missing, there is no purchase for resale and the body shop is deemed the consumer of the item purchased. When body shops purchase items which will be resold (see list of items in this rule) in the course of the repair activity , the vendors selling to the body shops are encouraged to accept a valid resale certificate at the time of purchase. See rule 701\u201415.3 (422,423). Failure of the vendor to accept a valid resale certificate may subject that vendor to sales tax liability since the burden of proof would be on the vendor that a sale was made for resale. If the vendor cannot meet that burden, the vendor will be liable for the sales tax. Such burden is not met merely by a showing that the purchaser had obtained from the department an Iowa retail sales tax or retail use tax permit. For insurance purposes, body shops are reimbursed by insurance companies for \"materials\" which such shops consume in rendering repair services. Some of the materials are transferred to the recipients of the repair services and some are not. Of those so transferred, such transfer is in irregular quantities and is not in a form or quantity capable of a fixed or definite price value. Therefore, body shops are generally deemed to be the consumers of materials and must pay tax on these items at the time of purchase. Nonexclusive examples of items most likely to be included in this category of \"materials,\" whether actually transferred to customers of body shops or not, are as follows: Abrasives Accessories Battery water Body filler or putty Body lead Bolts, nuts and washers IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 29 Brake fluid Buf fing pads Chamois Cleaning compounds Degreasing compounds Floor dry Hydraulic jack oil Lubricants Masking tape Paint Polishes Rags Rivets and cotter pins Sand paper Sanding discs Scuf f pads Sealer and primer Sheet metal Solder Solvents Spark plug sand Striping tape Thinner Upholstery tacks W axes White sidewall cleaner The following are nonexclusive examples of parts which can be purchased for resale since they are generally transferred to the body shop' s customer during the course of the repair in a form or quantity capable of a fixed or definite price value and are generally itemized separately as parts. Batteries Brackets Bulbs Bumpers Cab corners Chassis parts Doors Door guards Door handles Engine parts Fenders Floor mats Grills Headlamps Hoods Hub caps Radiators Rocker panels Shock absorbers Side molding Spark plugs T ires T rim Ch 18, p. 30 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 T runk lids Wheels W indow glass W indshield ribbon W indshields The following are nonexclusive examples of tools and supplies which are generally not transferred to the body shop' s customer during the course of the repair and therefore could not be purchased for resale. The body shop is deemed the consumer of these items since they are not transferred to a customer and therefore the body shop must pay tax to the vendor at the time of purchase. Air compressors and parts Body frame straightening equipment Brooms and mops Buf fers Chisels Drill bit Drop cords Equipment parts Fire extinguisher fluids Floor jacks Hand soap Hand tools Of fice supplies Paint brushes Paint sprayers Sanders Spreaders for putty Signs W ashing equipment and parts W elding equipment and parts Because of the nature of their business and the formulas devised by the insurance industry to reimburse body shops for cost of \"materials,\" it is possible for body shops, in their invoices to their customers, to separately set forth labor , resold parts, and materials. While the materials can be separately invoiced as one general item, there is no way to ascertain a definite and fixed price for each item of the materials listed in this rule and consumed by the body shops and some of such individual materials are not even transferred by body shops to their customers. Therefore, the body shops are generally the \"consumers\" of \"materials\" and do not purchase them for resale. W .J. Sandber g Co. v . Iowa State Boar d of Assessments and Review , 225 Iowa 103, 278 N.W . 643 (1938). Thus, body shops should pay tax to their suppliers on all materials purchased and consumed by them. If materials are purchased from non-Iowa suppliers who do not collect Iowa tax from body shops, such body shops should remit consumer use tax to the Department of Revenue on such materials. Body shops must collect sales tax on the taxable service of repairing motor vehicles. See rule 701\u201426.5 (422). However , due to the nature of the insurance formulas, it is possible for body shops to itemize that portion of their billing which would be for repair services and that portion relating to consumed \"materials.\" It is also possible for body shops to itemize that portion of their char ges for parts which they purchase for resale to their customers. Body shops do not and cannot resell the tools and supplies previously listed in this rule and are taxable on their purchases of such items. Therefore, as long as body shops separately itemize on their invoices to their customers the amounts for labor , parts, and for \"materials,\" body shops should collect sales tax on the labor and the parts, but not on the materials as enumerated in this rule. E XAMPLE : A body shop repairs a motor vehicle by replacing a fender and painting the vehicle. In doing the repair work, the body shop uses rags, sealer and primer , paint, solder , thinner , to IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 31 the customer , the labor is separately listed at $300, the part (fender) is separately listed at $300, and the category of \"materials\" is separately listed for a lump sum of $100, for a total billing of $700. The Iowa sales tax computed by the body shop should be on $600 which is the amount attributable to the labor and the parts. The materials consumed by the body shop were separately listed and would not be included in the tax base for \"gross taxable services\" as defined in Iowa Code subsection 422.42(16) , which is taxable in Iowa Code section 422.43 . In this example, if the \"materials\" were not separately listed on the invoice, but had been included in either or both of the labor or part char ges by marking up such char ges, the body shop would have to collect sales tax on the full char ges for parts or labor even though tax was paid on materials by the body shop to its supplier at time of purchase. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 422.42 , 422.43 and 423.2 . 701\u201418. 32 (422,423) Sale, transfer or exchange of tangible personal pr operty or taxable enumerated services between affiliated corporations. Rescinded exemption with r etr oactive effective date. 18.33 (1) For the purposes of this rule, a \"printer\" is any person, a portion of whose business involves the completion of a finished, printed product for sale at retail by that person or another person. A \"printer\" is also any person, a portion of whose business involves the completion of a finished printed packaging material used to package products for ultimate sale at retail. The term \"printer\" does not include any person printing or copyrighting printed material for its own use or consumption and not for resale. A \"publisher\" means and includes any person who owns the right to produce, market, and distribute printed literature and information for ultimate sale at retail. 18.33 (2) Ef fective May 4, 1995, and retroactive to July 1, 1983, the gross receipts from the sale or rental of the following to a printer or publisher are exempt from tax: acetate; antihalation backing; antistatic spray; back lining; base carrier for light sensitive emulsions; blankets; blow-ups; continuous and materials: acids, plastic desensitizer emulsion, types; process lettering; proof paper; proofs and proof processes, all pumice powder; purchased author alterations; purchased and any other items used in a similar capacity to any of the above-enumerated items by the printer or publisher to complete a finished product for sale at retail. Expendable tools and supplies not enumerated in this subrule are subject to tax. 18.33 (3) Claim for refunds of tax, interest, or penalty paid for the period of July 1, 1983, to June 30, 1995, must be limited to $25,000 in the aggregate and will not be allowed unless filed prior to October 1, 1995. If the amount of claimed refunds for this period totals more than $25,000, the department must prorate the $25,000 among all claims. 701\u201418. 34 (422,423) Automatic data pr ocessing. Ch 18, p. 32 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 18.34 (1) In general. a. Applicability of tax. For the purposes of this rule, the tax on automatic data processing is applicable to the gross receipts of: (1) Sales and rentals of data processing equipment (hardware). (2) Sales and rentals of tangible personal property produced or consumed by data processing equipment or prewritten (canned) computer software used in data processing operations. (3) Certain enumerated services performed on or connected with data processing such as rental of tangible personal property , machine repair , services of machine operators, of fice and business machines repair , electrical installation, and any other taxable service enumerated in Iowa Code section 422.43 . b. Definitions. (1) Rescinded by 2020 Iowa Acts, House File 2641, section 97, ef fective July 1, 2020. (2) \"Har dwar e\" means the physical computer assembly and peripherals including, but not limited to, such items as the central processing unit, keyboards, consoles, monitors, memory , disk and tape drives, terminals, printers, plotters, modems, tape readers, document sorters, optical readers and digitizers. (3) \"Canned softwar e\" is prewritten computer software which is of fered for general or repeated sale or rental to customers with little or no modification at the time of the transaction beyond specifying the parameters needed to make the program run. Canned software is tangible personal property . The term also includes programs of fered for general or repeated sale or rental which were initially developed as custom software. Evidence of canned software includes the selling or renting of the software more than once. Software may qualify as custom software for the original purchaser or lessor but is canned software with respect to all others. Canned software includes program modules which are prewritten and later used as needed for integral parts of a complete program. (4) \"Custom softwar e\" is specified, designed, and created by a vendor at the specific request of a customer to meet a particular need and is considered to be a sale of a service rather than a sale of tangible personal property . It includes those services represented by separately stated char ges for the modification of existing prewritten software when the modifications are written or prepared exclusively for a customer . Modification to existing prewritten software to meet the customer ' s needs is custom computer programming only to the extent of the modification and only to the extent that the actual amount char ged for the modification is separately stated. Examples of services that do not result in custom software include loading parameters to initialize program settings and arranging preprogrammed modules to form a complete program. When the char ges for modification of a prewritten program are not separately stated, tax applies to the entire char ge made to the customer for the modified program unless the modification is so significant that the new program qualifies as a custom program. If the prewritten program before modification was previously marketed, the new program will qualify as a custom program if the price of the prewritten program was 50 percent or less of the price of the new program. If the prewritten program was not previously marketed, the new program will qualify as a custom program if the char ge made to the customer for custom programming services, as evidenced by the records of the seller , was more than 50 percent of the contract price to the customer . The department will consider the following records in determining the extent of modification to prewritten software when there is not a separate char ge for the modification: logbooks, timesheets, dated documents, source codes, specifications of work to be done, design of the system, performance requirements, diagrams of programs, flow diagrams, coding sheets, error printouts, translation printouts, correction notes, and invoices or billing notices to the client. (5) \"Storage media\" includes hard disks, compact disks, floppy disks, diskettes, diskpacks, magnetic tape, cards, or other media used for nonvolatile storage of information readable by a computer . (6) \"Rental\" includes any lease or license agreement between a vendor and a customer for the customer ' s use of hardware or software. (7) \"Pr ogram\" is interchangeable with the term \"software\" for purposes of this rule. 18.34 (2) T axable sales, r entals and services. IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 33 a. Sales of equipment. T ax applies to sales of automatic data processing equipment and related equipment. b. Rental or leasing of equipment. Where a lease includes a contract by which a lessee secures for a consideration the use of equipment which may or may not be used on the lessee' s premises, the rental or lease payments are subject to tax. See rule 701\u201426.18 on tangible personal property rental. c. Canned softwar e. The sale or rental for a consideration of any computer software which is not custom software is a transfer of tangible personal property and is taxable. Canned software may be transferred to a customer in the form of diskettes, disks, magnetic tape, or other storage media or by listing the program instructions on coding sheets. (1) T ax applies whether title to the storage media on which the software is recorded, coded, or punched passes to the customer or the software is recorded, coded, or punched on storage media furnished by the customer . A fee for the temporary transfer of possession of canned software for the purpose of direct use to be recorded, coded, or punched by the customer or by the lessor on the customer ' s premises, is a sale or rental of canned software and is taxable. (2) T ax applies to the entire amount char ged to the customer for canned software. Where the consideration consists of license fees, royalty fees, right to use fees or program design fees, whether for a period of minimum use or for extended periods, all fees includable in the purchase price are subject to tax. d. T raining materials. Persons who sell or lease data processing equipment may provide a number of training services with the sale or rental of their equipment. T raining services, per se, are not subject to tax. T raining materials, such as books, furnished to the trainees for a specific char ge are taxable. e. Services a part of the sale or lease of equipment. Where services, such as programming, training or maintenance services, are provided to those who purchase or lease automatic data processing and related equipment, on a mandatory basis as an inseparable part of the sale or taxable lease of the equipment, char ges for the furnishing of the services are includable in the measure of tax from the sale or lease of the equipment whether or not the char ges are separately stated. (Where the purchaser or lessee has the option to acquire the equipment either with the services or without the services, char ges for the services may not be excluded from the measure of tax if they are taxable enumerated services.) f. Materials and supplies. The transfer of title, for a consideration, of tangible personal property , including property on which or into which information has been recorded or incorporated is a sale subject to tax. Generally service bureaus are consumers of all tangible personal property , including cards and forms, which they use in providing services unless a separate char ge is made to customers for the materials, in which case, tax applies to the char ge made for the materials. g. Additional copies. When additional copies of records, reports, tabulation, etc., are sold, tax applies to the char ges made for the additional copies. \"Additional copies\" are all copies in excess of those produced on multipart carbon paper simultaneously with the production of the original and on the same printer , whether the copies are prepared by rerunning the same program, by using multiple simultaneous printers, by looping a program such that the program is run continuously , by using dif ferent programs to produce the same output product, or by other means. Where additional copies are prepared, the tax will be measured by the char ge made by the service bureau to the customer . If no separate char ge is made for the additional copies, tax applies to that portion of the gross receipts which the cost of the additional computer time (if any) and the cost of materials and labor cost to produce the additional copies bear to the total job cost. Char ges for copies produced by means of photocopying, multilithing, or by other means are subject to tax. T ax applies to a contract where data on magnetic tape are converted into combinations of alphanumeric printing, curve plotting or line drawings, and put on microfilm or photorecording paper . h. Mailing lists. Addressing (including labels) for mailing. Where the service bureau addresses, through the use of its automatic data processing equipment or otherwise, material to be mailed, with names and addresses furnished by the customer or maintained by the service bureau for the customer , tax does not apply to the char ge for addressing. Similarly , where the service bureau prepares, through the use of its automatic data processing equipment or otherwise, labels to be af fixed to material to be mailed, with names and address furnished by the customer or maintained by the service bureau for the Ch 18, p. 34 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 customer , tax does not apply to the char ge for producing the labels, regardless of whether the service bureau itself af fixes the labels to the material to be mailed. However , tax would be due on any tangible personal property , such as labels, consumed by the service bureau. (See \"f\" above.) Mailing lists in the form of Cheshire tapes, gummed labels, and heat transfers which are attached to envelopes and placed in the mail by a service bureau constitute tangible personal property and are subject to tax. i. Services of a machine operator . The services of a machine operator , such as a key punch operator or the operator of any other data processing equipment, when hired to operate another person' s machinery or equipment, are subject to tax when contracted for and performed by someone other than an employee of the owner of the machinery and equipment. j. Maintenance contracts. Maintenance contracts sold in connection with the sale or lease of canned software generally provide that the purchaser will be entitled to receive storage media on which prewritten program improvements have been recorded. The maintenance contract may also provide that the purchaser will be entitled to receive certain services, including error corrections and telephone or on-site consultation services. (1) Nonoptional maintenance contract. If the maintenance contract is required as a condition of the sale or rental of canned software, it will be considered as part of the sale or rental of the canned software, and the gross sales price is subject to tax whether or not the char ge for the maintenance contract is separately stated from the char ge for software. (2) Optional maintenance contracts prior to July 1, 1998. If the maintenance contract is optional to the purchaser of canned software, then only the portion of the contract fee representing improvements delivered on storage media is subject to sales tax if the fee for other services, including consultation services and error corrections, is separately stated. If the fee for other services, including consultation services and error corrections, is not separately stated from the fee for improvements delivered on storage media, the entire char ge for the maintenance contract is subject to sales tax. (3) Optional maintenance contracts on and after July 1, 1998. If an optional software maintenance or support contract provides for technical support services only , then no tax is imposed on the gross receipts from the performance of those services. If an optional software maintenance or support contract separately states the char ges which represent improvements delivered on storage media from char ges which represent other services, including consultation services and error correction, then only that portion of the contract fee representing improvements delivered on the storage media is subject to sales tax. If an optional software maintenance or support contract provides for the taxable transfer of tangible personal property and the provision of nontaxable services, and there is no separately stated char ge for the taxable transfer of property or for the nontaxable service, then state sales tax of 5 percent shall be imposed on 50 percent of the gross receipts from the sale of such contracts. See 701\u2014paragraph 18.25(3) \"c\" for more information. 18.34 (3) Nontaxable items and activities. a. Custom pr ograms. These are programs prepared to the special order of a customer . T ax does not apply to the transfer of custom programs in the form of written procedures, such as program instructions listed on coding sheets. T ax applies to the sale of material transferred to the customer in the form of typed or printed sheets if separately invoiced. b. Pr ocessing a client' s data. Generally speaking, if a person enters into a contract to process a client' s data by the use of a computer program, or through an electrical accounting machine programmed by a wired plugboard, the processing of a client' s data is nontaxable. Such contracts usually provide that the person will receive the client' s source documents, record data in machine readable form, such as in punch cards or on magnetic tape, make necessary corrections, rearrange or create new information as the result of the processing and then provide tabulated listings or record output on other media. This service will be considered nontaxable even if the total char ge is broken down into specific char ges for each step. The furnishing of computer programs and data by the client for processing under direction and control of the person providing the service is nontaxable even though char ges may be based on computer time. The true object of these contracts is considered to be a service, even though some tangible personal property is incidentally transferred to the client. However , tax will apply to tangible personal property separately invoiced to the client. IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 35 c. T ime sharing. Char ges made for the use of automatic data processing equipment, on a time-sharing basis, where access to the equipment is by means of remote facilities, are not subject to tax. T ime sharing which is, in fact, a rental of equipment and the lessee exercises the right of possession or control over the equipment is subject to tax. See 18.34(2) \"b\" and rule 701\u201426.18(422) . d. Designing of systems, converting of systems, consulting, training, and miscellaneous services. These services consist of the developing of ideas, concepts and designs. Common examples of these nontaxable services are: (1) Designing and implementing computer systems (e.g., determining equipment and personnel required and how they will be utilized). (2) Designing storage and data retrieval systems (e.g., determining what data communications and high speed input-output terminals are required). (3) Converting manual systems to automatic data processing systems, converting present automatic data processing systems to new systems (e.g., changing a second generation system to a third generation system). (4) Consulting services (e.g., studies of all or part of a data processing system). (5) Feasibility studies (e.g., studies to determine what benefits would be derived if procedures were automated). (6) Evaluation of bids (e.g., studies to determine which manufacturer ' s proposal for computer equipment would be most beneficial). (7) Providing technical help such as analysts and programmers, usually on an hourly basis. (8) W riting (coding) and testing of programs\u2014contract programming. These services result in the production of customized programs. This type of service is not taxable because programming requires the development or ascertainment of information, and the evaluation of data, in addition to other development skills. Persons engaged in providing nontaxable computer services are the consumers of all tangible personal property used in such activities, and the tax must be paid on their acquisition of such property . This paragraph, 18.34(3) \"d,\" shall become ef fective for periods beginning on or after April 1, 1992. e. Installation char ges. Where installation char ges are separately contracted for or where no contract exists, are separately invoiced, or do not constitute enumerated taxable services, they are exempt from tax. See rule 701\u201415.14 (422,423). f. Pickup and delivery char ges. The tax will not apply to pickup and delivery char ges which are separately contracted for or where no contract exists, are separately invoiced. g. Rental of computer pr ograms. Prior to July 1, 1984, the rental of computer programs was not subject to tax since the program did not constitute equipment. KTV O, Inc. vs. Bair , 1977, Iowa 225 N.W .2d, 1 1 1. For the rule regarding prewritten (canned) programs subsequent to that date, see 18.3(2) \"c.\" This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 422.42 , 422.45 and 423.2 and Iowa Code Supplement section 422.43 as amended by 1998 Iowa Acts, Senate File 2288 . [see Rescission note at end of chapter] 701\u201418. 35 (422,423) Drainage tile. The sale or installation of drainage tile which is to be used in disease control, weed control, or the health promotion of plants or livestock produced as part of agricultural production for market is exempt from tax. Drainage tile, when purchased for these purposes, is therefore not subject to tax. In all other cases, drainage tile will be considered a building material and subject to tax under the provisions of Iowa Code subsection 422.42(9) . This rule is intended to implement , 422.42(9) , and 423.2 . 701\u201418. 36 (422,423) T rue leases and pur chases of tangible personal pr operty by lessors. 18.36 (1) T rue leases and pur chases by lessors prior to, on, and subsequent to July 1, 1978. The definition of a sale specified in Iowa Code subsection 422.42(2) does not include leases. Hence, the exemption from tax on sales for resale is inapplicable to the purchase of tangible personal property for the purpose of leasing such property to others, but not for the purpose of reselling such property . Ch 18, p. 36 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 Cedar V alley Leasing, Inc. v . Iowa Department of Revenue, 274 N.W .2d 357 (Iowa 1979). However , even though the general rule is that the acquisition cost of tangible personal property purchased for the purpose of leasing it to others is subject to the Iowa sales or use tax, certain transactions are exempted from tax by statute. See subrule 18.36(4) . 18.36 (2) General. Prior to July 1, 1984, tax is due on the lease or rental payments derived from the service of equipment rental only and not from the lease or rental of other tangible personal property . See 701\u2014subrule 26.18(1) . T ax would also be due on the gross receipts received on the disposal of the tangible personal property provided no exemption exists. When property is purchased for the purpose of financing under a conditional sales contract, the property is purchased for resale, and the acquisition of the property is not subject to Iowa tax. See rule 701\u201416.47 (422,423). The gross receipts from the leasing of property for subletting purposes is exempt from tax as a resale of a service, but the lessee must collect tax on the gross receipts from subletting unless such subletting is otherwise exempt from tax. a. Where a resident or nonresident lessor leases equipment to a resident or nonresident lessee and the lease contract is executed in Iowa and the equipment is delivered to the lessee in Iowa, the rental payments are subject to Iowa sales tax, even if the equipment is taken by the lessee to another state. W illiams Rentals, Inc. v T idwell, 516 S.W .2d 614 (T enn. 1974). b. Where a nonresident lessor leases equipment to a resident or nonresident lessee and the lessee uses the equipment in Iowa, the nonresident lessor has the responsibility of collecting Iowa use tax on the lease payments, provided the lessor maintains a place of business in Iowa as provided in Iowa Code sections 423.1(6) and 423.9 . Whether the lease agreement is executed in Iowa or not is irrelevant. State T ax Commission v . General T rading Co., 322 U.S. 335, 64 S.Ct. 1028,88 L.Ed 1309, (1944). c. Where a lessee is the recipient of equipment rental services as defined in \"a\" and \"b\" above and no tax has been collected from such lessee by the lessor , the lessee should remit Iowa use tax to the department of revenue. In the event no tax is remitted, the department, in its discretion, may seek to collect the tax from the lessor or lessee. In the event that the lessee is the recipient of equipment rental services, and the lessor does not maintain a place of business in Iowa and does not collect use tax pursuant to Iowa Code section 423.10 , such lessee shall remit tax on its rental payments to the department. d. Where a resident lessor leases equipment to a nonresident lessee outside of Iowa, and the equipment is delivered to the lessee outside Iowa, the act of leasing is exempt from the Iowa sales tax on the rental payments. However , in the event the lessee brings the equipment into Iowa and uses it in Iowa, Iowa use tax applies to rental payments, but see \"g\" below . e. Where a resident or nonresident lessor purchases tangible personal property in Iowa for subsequent lease in or out of Iowa and takes delivery of the equipment in Iowa, the lessor ' s purchase is subject to Iowa sales tax. Dodgen Industries, Inc. v . Iowa State T ax Commission, 160 N.W .2d 289 (Iowa 1968). f. When a resident or nonresident lessor purchases tangible personal property outside of Iowa for the purpose of leasing it in Iowa and the equipment is brought into Iowa and used by the resident or nonresident lessee in this state, the lessor is considered as having a \"use\" of the property in Iowa and Iowa use tax will apply to the lessor ' s purchase price of the property , regardless whether or not the lessor makes any physical use of the property in Iowa. Union Oil Company of California v . State Boar d of Equalization, 1963, 34 Cal. Rpts. 872, 386 P .2d 496. g. If a sales or use tax has already been paid to another state on the purchase price of equipment prior to the use of that equipment in Iowa, a tax credit against the Iowa use tax on the purchase price will be given. After the equipment is brought into Iowa, if a sales or use tax is properly payable and is paid to another state on the rental payments of equipment, for the same time the Iowa tax is imposed on such rentals, a tax credit against the Iowa use tax on such rental payments will be given. Hennefor d v . Silas Mason Co., 1937, U.S.577, 57 524, S1 L.Ed. 814. 18.36 (3) Leases r elating to vehicles subject to r egistration. a. V ehicles as defined in Iowa Code subsections 321.1(4), (6), (8), (9), and (10) (motor trucks, truck tractors, road tractors, trailers, and semitrailers), except when designed primarily for carrying IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 37 persons, can be purchased free of use tax when purchased for lease and actually leased for use outside Iowa if the subsequent sole use in Iowa is in interstate commerce or interstate transportation. b. T angible personal property which by means of fabrication, compounding, or manufacturing becomes an integral part of vehicles as defined in 18.36(3) \"a\" when manufactured for lease and actually leased to a lessee for use outside the state of Iowa, can be purchased free of use tax provided the sole subsequent use of the vehicle in Iowa is in interstate commerce or interstate transportation. (Iowa purchases which would be subject to Iowa sales tax do not qualify for this exemption.) See rule 701\u201433.7 (423). The provisions of \"a\" and \"b\" are ef fective for periods beginning on January 1, 1973. Also see 701\u2014Chapter 34 of the rules relating to vehicles subject to registration. 18.36 (4) Special rules for lessors on or after July 1, 1978. If tangible personal property is purchased for leasing, the purchase of the property is exempt from tax if the following conditions are met: a. The person (lessor) purchasing the property is regularly engaged in the business of leasing, b. The period of the lease is for more than one year for sales or property occurring from July 1, 1978, to May 18, 1997, inclusive; for sales of property occurring on and after May 19, 1997, the period of the lease must be for more than five months, and c. The lease or rental receipts must be subject to tax under the service of equipment rental. All three conditions must be met before the exemption applies. If the exemption is properly claimed, it is lost when the property is made use of for any purpose other than leasing and the person claiming the exemption is liable for the tax based on the original purchase price. T ax paid on the leasing or rental payments would be allowed as a credit against the tax due on the purchase price. In the following examples, assume, unless stated to the contrary , that the lease or rental receipts are subject to tax. The examples are written on the assumption that the period for an exempt lease is five months or longer . Thus, these examples are basically applicable to the period beginning May 19, 1997; however , the examples illustrate principles which are applicable to the purchase for lease exemption for periods longer than one year which was the requirements for exemption prior to May 19, 1997. E XAMPLE : A restaurant makes a one-time purchase of of fice furniture which it leases to an insurance company for a period of four years. The purchase of of fice furniture by the restaurant would be subject to tax because the restaurant is not regularly engaged in the business of leasing. However , if the restaurant established a pattern of regularly purchasing of fice furniture or other tangible personal property for lease, the exemption would apply . E XAMPLE : A company purchases a computer which will be leased for a period of three years, at which time the computer is returned to the company . The sole business of the company is to purchase this one computer for lease. The purchase of the computer is exempt from tax because the company is regularly engaged in the business of leasing. E XAMPLE : A leasing company purchases three lawn mowers which will be leased to individuals for periods of time less than five months. The purchase of the lawn mowers by the leasing company would be subject to tax because the periods of the leases are for less than five months. E XAMPLE : A leasing company purchases a computer which will be leased for a period of three years. The purchase of the computer is exempt from tax because the period of the lease is for more than five months. E XAMPLE : A leasing company buys a computer . The company claims the exemption from tax, but the company uses the computer in its own operations. T ax is due on the original purchase price and the leasing company is liable for the tax due. E XAMPLE : A leasing company purchases a copying machine which will be leased for a period of two years. After four months, the machine is returned to the leasing company and then the machine is immediately re-leased without being used by the leasing company for any other purpose. The exemption would apply because it was properly claimed and nothing occurred to cause loss of the exemption. E XAMPLE : A leasing company purchases a copying machine which will be leased for a period of two years. After four months, the machine is returned and the leasing company then uses the machine in its own business. The exemption would no longer apply and the leasing company would be liable for the Ch 18, p. 38 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 tax based on the original purchase price. Credit would be allowed against the tax due on the purchase price for any tax paid on the lease or rental payments. Assume the leasing company paid $2,000 for the copying machine and char ged $200 per month plus $10 in tax per month. Since the machine is returned and the exemption is not applicable, the leasing company would owe $100 on the $2,000 acquisition cost. However , the leasing company collected $40 (four months x $10) tax on the monthly rental char ges. Allowing the credit for tax collected of $40 against the total tax liability of $100 leaves a net tax liability of $60 owed by the leasing company . E XAMPLE : A manufacturer and seller of of fice furniture also leases of fice furniture. The leases always run for a period longer than five months and the company usually has only two leases per year . The leasing operation only accounts for 1 percent of the company' s total business. The company still qualifies for the exemption because it is regularly engaged in the business of leasing and the period of the lease is for more than five months. E XAMPLE : A leasing company purchases an airplane from an aircraft dealer and leases it for a period of three years. The lease or rental payments are not taxed because of the exemption for transportation services. The leasing company would owe tax based on the acquisition cost because the lease or rental payments are not subject to tax under the service of equipment rental. E XAMPLE : A leasing company purchases equipment and leases it to a lessee for a period of 18 months. For the first 3 months, the equipment is used by the lessee in making repairs to existing structures and the lease receipts are taxable. For the remainder of the lease period, the equipment is used in new construction of buildings and structures and the lease receipts are exempt from tax. The acquisition cost of the equipment is exempt because the exemption was properly claimed and was not subsequently lost by a use other than leasing. E XAMPLE : A leasing company purchases from an Iowa retailer equipment on May 18, 1997, for the purpose of leasing it for a period of six months. The lease receipts will be taxable. The sales tax exemption on the acquisition cost to the lessor cannot be claimed because the sale occurred before May 19, 1997, and, at the time of the sale, no sales tax exemption applied to such acquisition cost. The exemption for acquisition cost should not be given a retroactive ef fect. Jones v . Gor dy , 1935, 169 Md. 173, 180 Atl. 272. E XAMPLE : A leasing company purchases equipment outside of Iowa on May 1, 1997. The lessee brings the equipment into Iowa on June 1, 1997, and uses it in Iowa. The lease period is nine months, and the lessee' s use in Iowa is subject to Iowa use tax on the lease payments. Under these circumstances, the Iowa use tax exemption on the lessor ' s acquisition cost applies because it is the law in ef fect at the time of use in Iowa, not at the time of sale, which determines whether a use tax exemption applies. City of Ames v . Iowa State T ax Commission, 1955, 246 Iowa 1016, 71 N.W .2d 15; Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co. v . Iowa State T ax Commission, 1958, 250 Iowa 193, 92 N.W .2d 129. E XAMPLE : A leasing company purchases equipment not for resale and leases it to the lessee for a period of more than five months. After three months, the equipment is returned to the leasing company which then sells the equipment. Such sale is not part of the regular course of the leasing company' s business. The exemption, though properly claimed, is lost because, by reason of such sale, the leasing company made use of the property for a purpose other than leasing or renting. Had the equipment been returned to the leasing company on or after five months and one day from the commencement of the lease period, and the leasing company then sold the equipment outside the regular course of its business or used the equipment in its business, the exemption for acquisition cost would not be lost. Had the equipment been purchased for resale and leased prior to such resale, the acquisition cost to the leasing company would be exempt from tax. Herman M. Br own Co. v . Johnson, 1957, 248 Iowa 1 143, 82 N.W .2d 134. If the equipment is traded in toward the purchase price of other equipment by the leasing company , or if the leasing company disposes of the equipment after it is fully depreciated, the exemption for acquisition cost is not lost. Where sale of equipment outside the regular course of business is made by the leasing company , see also rule 18.28(422) to determine whether the casual sale exemption applies to the receipts from such sale. E XAMPLE : A leasing company purchases equipment which is leased to the lessee. Assume that the exemption for acquisition cost of the equipment was properly claimed. Thereafter , the lessee makes an IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 39 assignment of the lease. The exemption is not lost since the assignee stands in the same position as the original lessee and such an assignment does not change the nature of the original lease period. Ber g v . Ridgway , 1966, 258 Iowa 640, 140 N.W .2d 95. E XAMPLE : A leasing company purchases equipment which is leased to the lessee in accordance with the criteria creating the acquisition cost exemption. The leasing company sells the lease contracts, as commercial paper , to others. The exemption for acquisition cost can still be claimed and such sales of lease contracts do not cause loss of the exemption. E XAMPLE : A leasing company purchases equipment which is leased to the lessee in accordance with the criteria creating the acquisition cost exemption. Thereafter , the lease can no longer be performed because the property is destroyed by an act of God. The acquisition cost exemption is not lost. E XAMPLE : A leasing company purchases equipment which is leased to the lessee in accordance with the criteria creating the acquisition cost exemption. Thereafter , the lessee is adjudged bankrupt and the equipment is returned to the leasing company and is re-leased without being used by the leasing company for any other purpose. The acquisition cost exemption is not lost since the leasing company makes no use for any purpose other than leasing or renting. E XAMPLE : A leasing company purchases equipment which is leased to a lessee. The criteria for the acquisition cost exemption are present. The lessee then sublets the equipment to another for a period less than five months. The acquisition cost exemption is not lost. 18.36 (5) Lease or r ental of all tangible personal pr operty now subject to tax. On and after July 1, 1984, the lease or rental of all tangible personal property is subject to tax. See rule 701\u201426.18 (422) for information concerning additional transactions subject to tax after that ef fective date. This rule is intended to implement fuel, special fuel, aviation fuels and gasoline. 18.37 (1) In general. The gross receipts from the sale of motor fuel and special fuel are exempt from sales tax under Iowa Code section 422.45(1 1) if (1) the fuel is consumed for highway use, in watercraft, or in aircraft, (2) the Iowa fuel tax has been imposed and paid, and (3) no refund or credit of fuel tax has been made or will be allowed. However , beginning July 1, 1985, the gross receipts from the sale of special fuel for diesel engines used in commercial watercraft on rivers bordering Iowa are exempt from sales tax, even though no fuel tax has been imposed and paid, providing the seller delivers the fuel to the owner ' s watercraft while it is afloat. Prior to July 1, 1988, retail sales of aviation gasoline were not exempt from sales tax under Iowa Code subsection 422.45(1 1) . See subrule 18.37(4) . 18.37 (2) Refunds or cr edits of motor fuel and special fuel. Claims for refund or credit of fuel taxes under the provisions of Iowa Code chapter 452A must be reduced by any sales or use tax owing the state unless a sales tax exemption is applicable. Generally , refund claims or credits are allowed where fuel is purchased tax paid and used for purposes other than to propel a motor vehicle or used in watercraft. 18.37 (3) Refunds of tax on fuel pur chased in Iowa and consumed out of Iowa. Even though fuel is purchased in Iowa, fuel tax paid in Iowa, and the fuel tax is subject to refund under the provisions of division III of Iowa Code chapter 452A relating to interstate motor vehicle operations, the refund of the fuel tax does not subject the purchase of the fuel to sales tax. Subjecting the purchase to sales tax has the ef fect of imposing sales tax when fuel is consumed in interstate commerce while fuel consumed on Iowa highways in intrastate commerce is exempt from sales tax pursuant to Iowa Code subsection 422.45(1 1) . The ef fect for sales tax purposes is to impose a greater tax burden on non-Iowa highway fuel consumption than Iowa highway fuel consumption thereby discriminating against interstate commerce. In addition, the ef fect of imposing sales tax on interstate excess purchases where intrastate highway use is not subject to the tax constitutes an export duty for purchasing fuel in Iowa and exporting it for use in another state. Such ef fects are in violation of the commerce clause of the United States Constitution. Boston Stock Exchange v . State T ax Commission, 1977, 429 U.S. 319, 97 S.Ct. 599,50 L.Ed.2d 514 and Coe v . Err ol, 16 U.S. 517, 6 S.Ct. 475, 29L.Ed. 715. 18.37 (4) A viation gasoline. T ax treatment prior to July 1, 1988. Prior to July 1, 1988, all Iowa fuel tax paid on aviation gasoline used in aircraft was refundable under Iowa Code section 452A.17 . Generally , aviation gasoline is not purchased for highway use or for use in watercraft, therefore, the Ch 18, p. 40 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 exemption from sales and use tax found in Iowa Code subsection 422.45(1 1) was generally not applicable to purchases of aviation gasoline. However , Iowa Code subsection 422.52(4) provides for the collection of sales tax by way of deduction from motor fuel tax refunds allowable under Iowa Code chapter 452A . Therefore, sales tax is not assessed at the retail level but only in instances where the fuel tax paid on aviation gasoline has been refunded. If no application for a fuel tax refund relating to aviation fuel has been made, no sales tax is assessed on the aviation gasoline purchase. 18.37 (5) Ethanol. For tax periods after April 30, 1981. Retail sales of ethanol are exempt from Iowa sales or use tax. 18.37 (6) T ax base. The basis for computing the Iowa sales tax will be the retail selling price of the fuel less any Iowa fuel tax included in such price. Federal excise tax should not be removed from the selling price in determining the proper sales tax due. W .M. Gurley v . Arny Rhoden supra. Also see rule 701\u201415.12 (422,423). This rule is intended to implement Iowa Urban transit systems. A privately owned urban transit system which is not an instrumentality of federal, state or county government is subject to sales tax on fuel purchases which are within the urban transit systems charter . T ax shall not apply to fuel purchases, made by a privately owned urban transit company , for use outside the urban transit system charter in which a fuel tax has been imposed and paid and no refund has been or will be allowed. Whether an urban transit company will be considered an instrumentality of federal, state or county government for the purpose of receiving sales tax exemption on its fuel purchases, which are also exempted from fuel tax and used for public purposes, depends upon consideration of the following: 1. Whether it is created by government. 2. Whether it is wholly owned by government. 3. Whether it is operated for profit. 4. Whether it is primarily engaged in the performance of some essential governmental function. 5. Whether the payment of tax will impose an economic burden upon the corporation, or that payment of tax serves to materially impair the usefulness or ef ficiency of the corporation or the payment of tax materially restricts the corporation in the performance of its duties. These above enumerated considerations are not all inclusive and the presence of some and absence of others does not necessarily establish the exemption. Unemployment compensation of North Car olina v . W achovia Bank and T rust Company , 2 S.E.2d 592, 595, 215 No. Car . 491 (1939); 1976 O.A.G. 823, 827, 828. This rule intended implement Iowa Code subsection 422.45(1) . 701\u201418. 39 (422,423) Sales or services r ender ed, furnished, or performed by a county or city . The gross receipts from the sales, furnishing, or service of gas, electricity , water , heat, and communication service rendered, furnished, or performed by a county or city are subject to the tax. On and after July 1, 1985, the gross receipts from fees paid to cities and counties for the privilege of participating in any athletic sports are also subject to tax. On or after July 1, 1991, the gross receipts from any municipally owned pay television service are taxable as well. On and after April 1, 1992, the gross receipts from a county or municipality furnishing sewage service or solid waste collection and disposal service to nonresidential commercial operations are taxable (see rules 701\u201426.71 (422,423) and 26.72 (422,423) for more information). Any other sales or services rendered, furnished, or performed by a county or city are not subject to the tax. A \"sport\" is any activity or experience which involves some movement of the human body and gives enjoyment or recreation. An \"athletic\" sport is any sport which requires physical strength, skill, speed, or training in its performance. The following activities are nonexclusive examples of athletic sports: IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 41 baseball, football, basketball, softball, volleyball, golf, tennis, racquetball, swimming, wrestling, and foot racing. The following is a list of various fees which would be considered fees paid to a city or county for the privilege of participating in any athletic sport, and thus subject to tax under this rule. The list is not exhaustive. 1. Fees paid for the privilege of using any facility specifically designed for use by those playing an athletic sport: fees for use of a golf course, ball diamond, tennis court, swimming pool, or ice skating rink are subject to tax. These fees are subject to tax whether they allow use of the facility for a brief or extended period of time, e.g., a daily fee or season ticket for use of a swimming pool or golf course would be subject to tax. Group rental of facilities designed for playing an athletic sport would also be subject to tax. 2. Fees paid to enter any tournament or league which involves playing an athletic sport would be subject to tax. Both team and individual entry fees are taxable. Fees paid to enter any marathon or foot race of shorter duration would be subject to tax under this rule. Not subject to tax as fees paid to a city or county for the privilege of participating in any athletic sport under this rule are the following char ges. The list is not intended to be exhaustive. 1. Fees paid for lesson or instruction in how to play or to improve one' s ability to play an athletic sport are not subject to tax. Golf and swimming lesson fees are specific examples of such nontaxable char ges. The fees are excluded from tax regardless of whether the person receiving the instruction is a child or an adult. Fees char ged for equipment rental, regardless of whether this equipment is helpful or necessary to participation in an athletic sport, are not subject to tax. The rental of a golf cart or moveable duck blind would not be subject to tax. The rental of a recreational boat is a transportation service, the gross receipts of which are not subject to tax if provided by a city or county . 2. Sales of merchandise, e.g., food or drink, to persons watching or participating in any athletic sport are not subject to tax. 3. Fees char ged to improve any facility where any athletic sport is played are not subject to tax, unless such a fee must be paid to participate in an athletic sport which can be played within the facility . 4. Fees paid by any person or or ganization to rent any county or city facility or any portion of any county or city park shall not be subject to tax unless the portion of the park or facility is specifically designed for the playing of an athletic sport. E XAMPLE : A local bridge club pays a fee to use a shelter house and the surrounding grounds at a county park for a picnic. During the course of the picnic, the club members set up a net and use the surrounding grounds to play volleyball. They also improvise a softball field and play a softball game there. The fee which the bridge club has paid to rent the shelter house and surrounding grounds would not be subject to tax. 5. Fees paid for the use of a campground or hiking trail are not subject to tax. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 422.43 and 422.45 . 701\u201418. 40 (422,423) Renting of r ooms. The gross receipts from the renting of any and all rooms, including but not limited to sleeping rooms, banquet rooms or conference rooms in any hotel, motel, inn, public lodging house, rooming or tourist court, or in any place where sleeping accommodations are furnished to transient guests, whether with or without meals, are subject to the tax. The rental of a mobile home or of manufactured housing which is tangible personal property is treated as room rental rather than tangible personal property rental. The renting of all rooms would be exempt from the tax if rented by the same person for a period of more than 31 consecutive days. The renter must contract to rent for a single period of 31 days or more. The renter may not accumulate these 31 days by contracting for two or more rental transactions. The incremental manner in which the hotel, motel, inn, public lodging house, rooming or tourist court, or any place where sleeping accommodations are furnished to transient guests bills its customers does not influence the accumulation of days that is required to claim the exemption. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 422.43 . 701\u201418. 41 (422,423) Envelopes for advertising. Ch 18, p. 42 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 18.41 (1) Some envelopes which contain advertising are exempt from tax. Envelopes which are not primarily used for advertising are taxable. The primary use of the envelopes should control whether they will be taxable or exempt. Iowa Movers and W ar ehouseman' s Assn. v . Briggs, 237 N.W .2d 759 (Iowa 1976). E XAMPLE 1: XYZ mails coupons and advertisements to persons giving discounts on a certain item which is sold at retail. The envelope used to package these materials is exempt from tax since it is primarily used to contain advertising materials. E XAMPLE 2: XYZ mails a monthly billing statement to its char ge account customers. In addition to the billing statement, XYZ Company encloses an advertisement in the envelope. The envelope has a dual purpose: (1) the collection of accounts receivable and (2) the distribution of advertising. However , the envelope is not primarily used for advertising but for billing the customer , therefore, the exemption does not apply . 18.41 (2) Because of the dif ficulty of administering this exemption, purchasers of envelopes may petition to the department for permission to use a formula to represent to the seller the portion of taxable and exempt gross receipts from envelope purchases. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code subsection 422.45(9) . 701\u201418. 42 (422,423) Newspapers, fr ee newspapers and shoppers' guides. 18.42 (1) General observations. The gross receipts from the sales of newspapers, free newspapers, and shoppers' guides are exempt from tax. The gross receipts from the sales of magazines, newsletters, and other periodicals which are not newspapers are taxable. Recent cases decided by the United States Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of Iowa prohibit exempting from taxation the sale of any periodical if that exemption from taxation is based solely upon the contents of that periodical. See Arkansas W riters' Pr oject, Inc. v . 95 L.Ed.2d 209 (1987) and Hearst v . Iowa Department of Revenue & Finance, 461 N.W .2d 295 (Iowa 1990). 18.42 (2) General characteristics of a newspaper . \"Newspaper\" is a term with a common definition. A \"newspaper\" is a periodical, published at short, stated, and regular intervals, usually daily or weekly . It is printed on newsprint with news ink. The format of a newspaper is that of sheets folded loosely together without stapling. A newspaper is admitted to the U.S. mails as second-class material. Other frequent characteristics of newspapers are the following: a. Newspapers usually contain photographs. The photographs are more often in black and white rather than color . b. Information printed on newspapers is usually contained in columns on the newspaper pages. c. The lar ger the cross section of the population which reads a periodical in the area where the periodical circulates, the more likely it is that the department will consider that periodical to be a \"newspaper .\" 18.42 (3) Characteristics of newspaper publishing companies. Companies in the business of publishing newspapers are dif ferently structured from other companies. Often, companies publishing lar ger newspapers will subscribe to various syndicates or \"wire services.\" A lar ger newspaper will employ a general editor and a number of subordinate editors as well, for example, sports and lifestyle editors; business, local, agricultural, national, and world news editors; and editorial page editors. A lar ger newspaper will also employ a variety of reporters and staf f writers. Smaller newspapers may or may not have these characteristics or may consolidate these functions. 18.42 (4) Characteristics which distinguish a newsletter fr om a newspaper . A \"newsletter\" is generally distributed to members or employees of a single or ganization and not usually to a lar ge cross section of the general public. It is often published at irregular intervals by a volunteer , rather than the paid individual who usually publishes a newspaper . A newsletter is often printed on sheets which are held together at one point only by a staple, rather than folded together . This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 422.45(9) . 701\u201418. 43 (422,423) W ritten contract. On and after July 1, 1985, the gross receipts from certain additional services are subject to tax. However , these newly taxable services are exempt from tax if IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 43 performed pursuant to a written services contract in ef fect on April 1, 1985. The exemption from taxation for these services expires June 30, 1986. The services to which this \"written contract\" exemption is applicable are the following: cable television; campgrounds; gun repair; janitorial and building maintenance or cleaning; lawn care, landscaping and tree trimming and removal; lobbying service; pet grooming; reflexology; security and detective services; tanning beds or salons; water conditioning and softening; the rental of recreational vehicles, recreational boats or motor vehicles subject to registration which are registered for a gross weight of 13 tons or less; and fees paid to cities and counties for the privilege of participating in any athletic sports. A \"written contract\" is one which is entirely in writing, so that all of its essential terms and provisions exist in writing, and oral statements are not necessary to set out any essential term or provision, such as who the parties to the contract are or what their rights and duties are under the contract. However , if it is necessary to resort to oral statements to explain the meaning of a written provision in a contract, a \"written contract\" can still exist. A written contract need not consist of one document or instrument only . It can consist of two or more writings, if all the necessary provisions of the contract are contained in those writings. For the purposes of this rule, the following must be stated in writing if a written contract is to exist: The nature and specification of the service to be provided, the name of the party providing the service, the name of the party receiving the service, the \"consideration\" (amount and method of payment) for providing the service, the signature of one or both of the parties to the contract, depending upon circumstances, and the date upon which the contract became ef fective. The written contract must be in ef fect on April 1, 1985, if the service to which the contract pertains is to be exempt from tax. If a contract is signed by only one of the parties to it, that contract is still a \"written contract\" if the party which has not signed the contract acquiesces in the promises which the party who has signed the document makes within it. McDermott v . Mahoney , 139 Iowa 292, 1 15 N.W . 32, (Iowa 1908). E XAMPLE : A security agency sends a proposed agreement to a potential customer promising to provide the services of a uniformed security guard for the customer ' s business premises beginning March 15, 1985, and continuing until March 15, 1987. The agreement is signed by the security agency' s president and dated February 15, 1985. The agreement is received by the potential customer ' s president, who does not sign it, but, on March 15, 1985, allows the security agency' s uniformed guard on the premises, and makes payment for those services as stipulated in the agreement. This agreement is a \"written contract\"; the services of the uniformed guard are not subject to tax for the period beginning July 1, 1985, and ending June 30, 1986. The services performed between July 1, 1986, and March 15, 1987, would be subject to tax. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code subsection 422.43(1 1) . 701\u201418. 44 (422,423) Sale or r ental of farm machinery and equipment. On and after July 1, 1987, the gross receipts from the sale or rental of farm machinery and equipment will be exempt from tax. Ef fective July 1, 1996, the gross receipts from the sale of property which is a container , label, carton, pallet, packing case, wrapping, baling wire, twine, bag, bottle, shipping case or other similar article or receptacle sold for use in agricultural, livestock or dairy production are not subject to sales tax. 18.44 (1) Characteristics of and limitations upon farm machinery and equipment. T o be eligible for exemption from or refund of tax under this rule the machinery or equipment must: a. Be directly and primarily used in production of agricultural products; and b. Be one of the following: (1) A self-propelled implement; or (2) An implement customarily drawn or attached to a self-propelled implement; or (3) A grain dryer; or (4) An auxiliary attachment which improves the performance, safety , operation, or ef ficiency of a qualifying implement or grain dryer if sale or first use in Iowa is on or after July 1, 1995; or (5) A replacement part for any item described in subparagraph (1), (2), (3), or (4). Ch 18, p. 44 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 (6) Ef fective July 1, 1996, the gross receipts from the sale of property which is a container , label, carton, pallet, packing case, wrapping, baling wire, twine, bag, bottle, shipping case, or other similar article or receptacle sold for use in agricultural, livestock or dairy production. c. No vehicle subject to registration, as defined in Iowa Code subsection 423.1(7) , implement customarily drawn or attached to a vehicle, auxiliary attachment, or any replacement part for a vehicle, implement, or auxiliary attachment is eligible for the exemption or refund allowed under this rule. 18.44 (2) Definitions and characterizations. For the purposes of this rule, the following definitions apply . a. Production of agricultural products means the same as the term \"agricultural production\" which is defined in 701\u2014subrule 17.9(3), paragraph \"a,\" to mean a farming operation undertaken for profit by raising crops or livestock. Production of agricultural products begins with the cultivation of land previously cleared for planting of crops or with the purchase or breeding of livestock or domesticated fowl. Not included within the meaning of the phrase are the clearing or preparation of previously uncultivated land, the creation of farm ponds or the erection of machine sheds, confinement facilities, storage bins or other farm buildings. See T rullinger v . emont County , 223 Iowa 677, 273 N.W . 124 (1937). Machinery and equipment used for these purposes would be used for activities which are preparatory to but not a part of the production of agricultural products. The production of agricultural products ceases when an agricultural product has been transported to the point where it will be sold by the farmer or processed. E XAMPLE . Farmer Brown uses a tractor and wagon to haul harvested corn from a field to a grain dryer located on the farm. After the corn is dried, the same tractor and wagon are used to move the grain to a storage bin, also located on the farm. Later the same tractor and wagon are used to deliver the corn from the farm to the local elevator where it is sold. After Farmer Brown deposits the corn there, the local elevator uses its own tractor and wagon to move the corn to a place of relatively permanent storage. Farmer Brown has used the tractor and wagon in the production of agricultural products and the refund or exemption would apply . The elevator has not used its tractor and wagon in such production; refund or exemption would not be lawful. b. Farm machinery and equipment means machinery and equipment specifically designed for use in the production of agricultural products or equipment and machinery not specifically designed for this use but which are directly and primarily used in the production of agricultural products. E XAMPLE . Farmer Jones raises livestock and the farming operation requires that fences be built to confine the livestock. Farmer Jones purchases a posthole digger that is customarily attached to a tractor and uses the digger to construct the fences used to confine the livestock. The posthole digger is not specifically designed for use in the production of agricultural products but would be directly and primarily used in the production of agricultural products. Therefore, the exemption or refund applies. c. Self-propelled implement has the same meaning as in 701\u2014subrule 17.9(5), paragraph \"c,\" where the term is defined to mean an implement which is capable of movement from one place to another under its own power . The term self-propelled implement includes but is not limited to the following items: skidloaders and tractors; and the following machinery if capable of movement under its own power: combines, corn pickers, fertilizer spreaders, hay conditioners/windrowers, sprayers, and bean buggies. d. Implements customarily drawn or attached to self-propelled implements. The following is a nonexclusive, representative list of implements which are customarily drawn or attached to self-propelled implements: Augers, balers, blowers, combines, conveyers, cultivators, spreaders, planters, plows, rotary blade mowers, rotary hoes, sprayers and tanks, and tillage equipment. e. Direct use in agricultural production. In determining whether farm machinery , equipment or any grain dryer is directly used in agricultural production, the fact that particular machinery or equipment is essential to the production of agricultural products because its use is required either by law or practical necessity does not, of itself, mean that the machinery or equipment is directly used in the production of agricultural products. Machinery or equipment coming into actual physical contact with the soil or IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 45 crops during the operations of planting, cultivating, harvesting, and soil preparation will be presumed to be machinery or equipment used in agricultural production. f. Grain dryer . The term grain dryer includes the heater and the blower necessary to force the warmed air into a grain storage bin. It does not include equipment used in grain storage or movement such as augers and spreaders or any other equipment that is not a grain dryer . Equipment other than a grain dryer which is used in grain drying may be exempt or subject to refund if the equipment is a self-propelled implement or customarily drawn or attached to a self-propelled implement. g. Replacement parts, dif fering meanings of the term for the period ending June 30, 1988, and for the period beginning July 1, 1988. (1) For the period beginning July 1, 1985, and ending June 30, 1988, a replacement part is refundable or exempt only if its cost is depreciable for state and federal income tax purposes. Replacement parts which are depreciable for state and federal income tax purposes include only those replacement parts which either materially add to the value of machinery or equipment or appreciably prolong its life. Replacement parts which only keep the machinery or equipment in its ordinarily ef ficient operating condition are not eligible for exemption or refund. Included within the meaning of replacement parts is any part the cost of which is depreciable for state and federal income tax purposes but which may also be deducted as a current expense. So long as the cost is depreciable the sale or lease of the replacement part is eligible for refund or exemption from tax. However , the person claiming the refund or exemption must show that the replacement part which was deducted as an expense could have been depreciated under state and federal income tax law . (2) On and after July 1, 1988, the sale or lease of a replacement part is exempt from tax if the replacement part is essential to any repair or reconstruction necessary to farm machinery or equipment' s exempt use in the production of agricultural products. The term \"replacement part\" does not include attachments and accessories which are not essential to the operation of the farm machinery or equipment. Nonexclusive examples of attachments or accessories are: cigarette lighters, radios, and add-on air -conditioning units. 18.44 (3) T axable and nontaxable transactions. The following are nonexclusive examples of sales and leases of farm machinery and equipment which are or are not subject to exemption and refund. a. A lessor ' s purchase of farm machinery and equipment is not subject to tax, or is taxable subject to refund, if the machinery or equipment is leased to a lessee who uses it directly and primarily in the production of agricultural products and if the lessee' s use of the machinery or equipment is otherwise exempt or subject to refund. T o claim exemption from tax or a refund of tax paid, the lessor need not make exempt use of the machinery or equipment so long as the lessee does. b. T o claim refund or exemption, the owner or lessee of farm machinery or equipment need not be a farmer so long as the machinery and equipment is directly and primarily used in the production of agricultural products, and the owner or lessee and the equipment or machinery meet the other requirements of this rule. For example, a person who purchases an airplane designed for use in agricultural aerial spraying and so used after purchase is entitled to the benefits of this rule even though that person is not the owner or occupant of the land where the airplane is used. c. The sale or lease, within Iowa, of any farm machinery , equipment, or replacement part for direct and primary use in agricultural production outside of Iowa is a transaction eligible for refund or exemption if those transactions are otherwise qualified under this rule. 18.44 (4) Auxiliary attachments. The following is a list (not inclusive) of auxiliary attachments described in 18.44(1) \"b\" (4) , the sale or first use in Iowa which is exempt from tax on and after July 1, 1995: auxiliary hydraulic valves, cabs, coil tine harrows, corn head pickup reels, dry till shanks, dual tires, extension shanks, fenders, fertilizer attachments and openers, fold kits, grain bin extensions, herbicide and insecticide attachments, kit wraps, no-till coulters, quick couplers, rear wheel assists, rock boxes, rollover protection systems, rotary shields, stalk choppers, step extensions, trash whips, upperbeaters, silage bags, and weights. 18.44 (5) IAB 9/7/88 , ef fective 10/12/88. This rule is Iowa Code subsections 422.43(3) and 422.45(26) , Iowa Code chapter 422 , Division IV , and Iowa Code section 422.45 as amended by 1996 Iowa Acts, chapter 1 145 . Ch 18, p. 46 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 701\u201418. 45 (422,423) Sale or r ental of computers, industrial machinery and equipment; r efund of and exemption fr om tax paid for periods prior to July 1, 1997. The sale or rental of computers, industrial machinery and equipment, including pollution control equipment, used in manufacturing, in research and development, or in the processing or storage of data or information by an insurance company , financial institution, or commercial enterprise is, under certain circumstances, exempt from tax and, under other circumstances, is subject to refund of sales or use tax paid. The sale or rental of machinery , equipment, or computers directly and primarily used in the recycling or reprocessing of waste products is also exempt from tax; see subrule 18.45(8) . For purposes of the or ganization of this rule, items that may be exempt or subject to refund of tax are referred to as specified property unless the context of the rule indicates otherwise. See subrule 18.45(1) for definition of what constitutes specified property . See rule 18.58 (422,423) for the manner in which the sale or rental of machinery , equipment, and computers to manufacturers and the sale or rental of computers to commercial enterprises are treated on and after July 1, 1997. 18.45 (1) Definitions. The following words are defined for the purposes of this rule in the manner set out below . \" Commer cial enterprise \" includes businesses and manufacturers conducted for profit and includes centers for data processing services to insurance companies, financial institutions, businesses, and manufacturers, but excludes professions and occupations and nonprofit or ganizations. A hospital that is a not-for -profit or ganization would not be a \"commercial enterprise.\" The term \"professions\" means a vocation or employment requiring specialized knowledge and often long and intensive academic preparation. The term \"occupations\" means the principal business of an individual. Included within the meaning of \"occupations\" is the business of farming. A professional corporation which carries on any business which is a \"profession\" or \"occupation\" is not a commercial enterprise. \" Dir ectly used. \" Property is \"directly used\" only if it is used to initiate, sustain, or terminate the transformation of any activity . In determining whether any property is \"directly used,\" consideration should be given to the following factors: 1. The physical proximity of the property in question to the activity in which it is used; 2. The proximity of the time of use of the property in question to the time of use of other property used before and after it in the activity involved; and 3. The active causal relationship between the use of the property in question and the activity involved. The fact that a particular piece of property may be essential to the conduct of the activity because its use is required either by law or practical necessity does not, of itself, mean that the property is directly used. \" Financial institution \" is a bank incorporated under Iowa Code chapter 524 or federal law; a savings and loan association incorporated under Iowa Code chapter 534 or federal law; a credit union or ganized under Iowa Code chapter 533 or federal law; or any corporation licensed as an industrial loan company under Iowa Code chapter 536A .

Machinery is any mechanical, electrical or electronic device designed and used to perform some function and to produce a certain ef fect or result. The word includes not only the basic unit of the machinery but also any adjunct or attachment necessary for the basic unit to accomplish its intended function. The word also includes all devices used or required to control, regulate or operate a piece of machinery , provided such devices are directly connected with or are an integral part of the machinery and are used primarily for control, regulation or operation of machinery . Jigs, dies, tools, and other devices necessary to the operation of or used in conjunction with the operation of what would be ordinarily thought of as machinery are also considered to be \"machinery .\" See Deer e Manufacturing Co. v . Zeiner , 247 Iowa 1264 78 N.W .2d 527 (1956). Machinery does not include buildings designed specifically to house or support machinery . Equipment is any tangible personal property used in an operation or activity . Nonexclusive examples of equipment are: tables on which property is assembled on an assembly line and chairs used by assembly line workers. IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 47 \" Insurance company \" means an insurer or ganized or operating under Iowa Code chapter 508 , 514 , 515 , 518 , 519 , or 520 or authorized to do business in Iowa as an insurer .

Construction contracting; quarrying; remanufacture or rebuilding of tangible personal property (such as automobile engines); provision of health care; farming; transporation for hire; mining; and the activities of restaurateurs, hospitals, and medical doctors are illustrative, nonexclusive examples of businesses which are not manufacturers. See Associated General Contractors of Iowa v . State T ax Commission, 255 Iowa 673, 123 N.W .2d 922 (1963) and River Pr oducts Co. v . Boar d of Review of W ashington County , 332 N.W .2d 1 16 (Iowa Ct. App. 1982). \" Pollution contr ol equipment \" means any disposal system or apparatus used or placed in operation primarily for the purpose of reducing, controlling or eliminating air or water pollution.

All computers store and process information. However , only if the \"final output\" for a user or consumer is stored or processed data will the computer be subject to refund or exemption of tax. \" Recycling \" means any process by which waste, or materials which would otherwise become waste, are collected, separated, or processed and revised or returned for use in the form of raw materials or products. The term includes, but is not limited to, the composting of yard waste which has been previously separated from other waste. \"Recycling\" does not include any form of ener gy recovery . \" Replacement parts. \" Replacement parts which are depreciable for state and federal income tax purposes include only those replacement parts which either materially add to the value of industrial machinery , equipment, or computers or appreciably prolong their lives. Replacement parts which only keep machinery , equipment, or computers in their ordinarily ef ficient operating condition are not eligible for exemption. Included within the meaning of replacement parts is any part the cost of which is depreciable for state and federal income tax purposes but which may also be deducted as a current expense.

However , the person claiming the exemption must show that the replacement part which was deducted as an expense could have been depreciated under state and federal income tax law . \" Resear ch and development \" means experimental or laboratory activity which has as its ultimate goal the development of new products, processes of manufacturing, refining, purifying, combining of dif ferent materials, or meat packing. The ultimate goal of research and development must be that of adding value to products. The term \"research and development\" does not include testing or inspection for quality control purposes, ef ficiency surveys, management studies, consumer surveys, advertising, promotions, or research in connection with literary , historical, or similar projects. Machinery , equipment, and computers are used \"directly\" in research and development only if they are used in actual experimental or laboratory activity that qualifies as research and development under this subrule. Ch 18, p. 48 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 \" Specified pr operty \" means property that is a computer or industrial machinery and equipment including pollution control equipment and depreciable replacement parts for that property . 18.45 (2) Requir ements. The sale or rental of specified property is exempt from tax if: a.

The property is directly and primarily used in one of the following: 1. By a manufacturer in processing tangible personal property; or 2. In research and development of new products or processes of manufacturing, refining, purifying, combining of dif ferent materials or packing of meats to be used for the purposes of adding value to products; or 3. In processing or storage of data or information by an insurance company , financial institution, or commercial enterprise. c. T o qualify for refund or exemption, a computer may be taxable as either commercial or industrial real estate. Machinery and equipment must be taxable as industrial real estate only to be similarly qualified. Research and development machinery and equipment that is not taxable as industrial real estate does not qualify for refund or exemption. See 701\u2014subrules 71.1(5) and 71.1(6) for characterizations of estate. However , see subrule 18.45(4) for an exception to the requirement that certain property be taxable as real property . d. The following are examples of machinery which is not directly used in manufacturing: 1. Machinery used exclusively for the ef ficient use of other machinery . Examples are: air cooling, air conditioning, and exhaust systems. 2. Machinery used in support operations, such as a machine shop, in which production machinery is assembled, maintained or repaired. 3. Machinery used by administrative, accounting, and personnel departments. 4. Machinery used by plant security , fire prevention, first aid, and hospital stations. 5. Machinery used in plant cleaning, disposal of scrap and waste, plant communications, lighting, safety , or heating. e. The following is an example of property directly used in research and development: Frontier Hybrid, Inc. maintains a research and development laboratory for use in developing a corn plant which is a perennial. It purchases the following items for use in its research and development laboratory: a computer which will process data relating to the genetic structure of the various corn plants which Frontier Hybrid is testing, an electron microscope for examining the structure of corn plant genes, a \"steam cleaner\" for cleaning rugs in the laboratory of fices, and a typewriter for use by the laboratory director ' s secretary . The computer and the microscope are \"directly\" used in the research in which the laboratory is engaged; the steam cleaner and the typewriter only indirectly used. Therefore, purchase of the computer and microscope would be exempt from tax; purchase of the steam cleaner and typewriter would be subject to tax. f. The following is an example of property used in processing or storage of information or data: A health insurance company has three computers. Computer A is used to monitor the temperature within the insurance company' s building. The computer transmits messages to the building' s heating and cooling systems telling them when to raise or lower the level of heating or air conditioning as needed. Computer B is used to store patient records and will recall those records on demand. Computer C is used to tabulate statistics regarding the amount of premiums paid in and the amount of benefit paid out for various classes of insured. The \"final output\" of Computer A is neither stored nor processed information. The final output of Computer B is stored information. The final output of Computer C is processed information. The sale, lease, or use of Computers B and C would qualify for exemption or refund. g. The following is an example of property not used in manufacturing: A manufacturing plant located in W arren County which manufactures widgets fabricates its own patterns used in manufacturing the widgets on a metal press machine in its machine shop located in Story County . The machine shop does not sell the patterns and the metal press machine is used for no other purpose than to fabricate the IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 49 patterns. The metal press machine is not used in manufacturing because there is no intent to sell the patterns used by the machine shop at a gain or profit. 18.45 (3) Exceptions. The following specified property is not exempt: a. Property assessed by the department of revenue pursuant to Iowa Code chapters 428 , 433 , 434 and 436 to 438 , inclusive.

Hand tools. c. Point-of-sale equipment. See 701\u2014subrule 71.1(7) . 18.45 (4) Inclusions. Property exempt from taxation for property tax purposes under the provisions of Iowa Code chapters 404 and 427B relating to urban revitalization property and industrial machinery receiving partial exemption by ordinance is also eligible for exemption from sales and use taxes even though the property is not subject to taxation as real property . Urban revitalization property and industrial machinery receiving partial exemption by ordinance are discussed in rules 701\u201480.8 (404) and 80.6 (427B), respectively . This property must meet the other requirements in subrule 18.45(2) in order to be exempt from sales and use taxes. 18.45 (5) Lessor pur chases of specified pr operty . The analysis contained in rule 18.44 (422,423) regarding lessor purchases of farm machinery and equipment is applicable to explain that same problem regarding specified property . See subrule 18.44(3) for analysis. 18.45 (6) Rights of efund Rescinded IAB 10/13/93 , ef fective 1 1/17/93. 18.45 (7) Designing or installing new industrial machinery or equipment. On and after July 1, 1985, the gross receipts from the services of designing or installing new industrial machinery or equipment shall be exempt from tax. The enumerated services of electrical or electronic installation are included in this exemption. T o qualify for the exemption, the sale or rental of the machinery or equipment must be subject to refund or exemption under this rule. In addition, the machinery or equipment must be \"new .\" For purposes of this subrule, \"new\" means never having been used or consumed by anyone. The exemption is not applicable to reconstructed, rebuilt or repaired or previously owned machinery or equipment. The exemption is applicable to new machinery and equipment designed or installed for rental as well as for sale. The gross receipts from design or installation must be separately identified, char ged separately , and reasonable in amount for the exemption to apply . A \"computer\" is not considered to be machinery or equipment, and its installation or design is not eligible for this exemption. 18.45 (8) Pr operty used in r ecycling or r epr ocessing of waste pr oducts. On and after July 1, 1989, the gross receipts from the sale or rental of machinery , equipment, or computers directly and primarily used in the recycling or reprocessing of waste products shall be exempt from tax. Machinery or equipment used in the recycling or reprocessing of waste products includes, but is not limited to, compactors, balers, crushers, grinders, cutters, or shears directly and primarily used for this purpose. The sale of an endloader , forklift, truck, or other moving device is exempt from tax if the device is directly and primarily used in the movement of property which is an integral part of recycling or reprocessing. See 18.45(8) \"c.\" The sale of a bin for storage ordinarily would not be exempt from tax, storage without more not being a part of recycling or reprocessing. Certain limits for exemption placed upon industrial machinery and equipment are not applicable to machinery and equipment used in recycling or reprocessing. For example, machinery , equipment or a computer need not meet the requirements of 18.45(2) \"a\" concerning specified property being real property for the exemption to apply . Furthermore, the exemption will apply even if the machinery , equipment or computer is purchased by a person other than an insurance company , financial institution or commercial enterprise. For instance, a person engaged in a profession or occupation could purchase property for direct and primary use in recycling or reprocessing of waste products and the exemption would apply . a. By way of nonexclusive examples, recycling or reprocessing can begin when waste or material which would otherwise become waste is collected or separated. A vehicle used directly and primarily for collecting waste which will be recycled or reprocessed could be a vehicle used for an exempt purpose under this rule. Thus, the purchaser of a garbage truck could claim this exemption if the truck were Ch 18, p. 50 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 directly and primarily used in recycling and not, for instance, in hauling garbage to a landfill. Machinery or equipment used to segregate waste from material to be recycled or reprocessed or used to separate various forms of materials which will be reprocessed (e.g., glass and aluminum) can also be used at the beginning of recycling or reprocessing. b. Machinery and equipment directly and primarily used in recycling or reprocessing. See subrule 18.45(1) for the definition of \"directly used\" which is applicable to this subrule. The examples of machinery not directly used in manufacturing set out in 18.45(2) \"d\" should be studied for guidance in determining whether similar machinery is or is not used in recycling or reprocessing; e.g., machinery used in plant security (see 18.45(2) \"d\" \"4\" ) is not machinery directly used in recycling or reprocessing. c. Integral use in recycling or reprocessing. Ordinarily , any operation or series of operations which does not transform waste or material which would otherwise become waste into new raw materials or products would not be a part of recycling or reprocessing. However , activities which do not do this, but are an \"integral part\" of recycling or reprocessing, are themselves recycling or reprocessing. For example, an endless belt which moves aluminum cans from a machine where they are shredded to a machine where the shredded aluminum is crushed into blocks would be an endless belt used in recycling or reprocessing and the exemption applies. See subrule 18.29(5) for a discussion of when an activity is an integral part of \"processing.\" Some of that discussion is applicable to this subrule. d. The end of recycling or reprocessing. Recycling or reprocessing ends when waste or a material which would otherwise become waste is in the form of raw material in which it will be used in manufacturing or in the form of a product which will be sold for use other than as a raw material in manufacturing. For instance, a corporation purchases a machine which grinds logs, stumps, pallets, and crates and other waste wood into wood chips. After grinding, the wood chips are sold and transported to purchasers to various sites where the chips are dumped on and spread out over the ground for use in erosion control. The machine which grinds the wood chips is a machine used in recycling. The truck which transports the wood chips from the machine to the sites is not used in reprocessing because, at the time the chips are placed in the truck, they are in the form in which they will be sold for use other than as a raw material in manufacturing. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 422.45(26) , Iowa Code section 422.45(27) as amended by 1996 Iowa Acts, chapter 1049 , and Iowa Code section 422.45(29) . [see Rescission note at end of chapter] 701\u201418. 46 (422,423) Automotive fluids. The gross receipts from the sales of certain automotive fluids are exempt from tax. T o be considered exempt, the sale must possess the following characteristics: (1) the sale must be to a retailer who will install the automotive fluid in or apply the automotive fluid to a motor vehicle; and (2) the installation or application must be done while the retailer is providing a taxable enumerated service (e.g., automobile lubrication); or (3) the automotive fluid must be installed in or applied to a motor vehicle which the retailer intends to sell and the sale of which will be subject to Iowa use tax. Specific but nonexclusive examples of \"automotive fluids\" are motor oil and other automobile lubricants, hydraulic, brake, and transmission fluids, sealants, undercoatings, antifreeze, and gasoline additives. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 422.45(33) . 701\u201418. 47 (422,423) Maintenance or r epair of fabric or clothing. 18.47 (1) As of July 1, 1987, sales of chemicals, solvents, sorbents, or reagents consumed in the maintenance or repair of fabric or clothing are exempt from tax. See 701\u2014subrule 17.14(1) for definitions of the terms \"chemical, solvent, sorbent or reagent.\" This subrule' s exemption is mainly applicable to dry-cleaning and laundry establishments; however , it is also applicable to soap or any chemical or solvent used to clean carpeting. The department presumes that a substance is \"directly used\" in the maintenance or repair of fabric or clothing if the substance comes in contact with the fabric or clothing during the maintenance or repair process. Substances which do not come into direct contact IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 51 with fabric or clothing may , under appropriate circumstances, be directly used in the maintenance or repair of the fabric or clothing but direct use will not be presumed. The following are examples of substances directly used and consumed in the maintenance or repair of fabric or clothing: perchloroethlyene \"perch\" or petroleum solvents used in dry-cleaning machines and coming in direct contact with the clothing being dry-cleaned. Substances used to clean or filter the \"perch\" or petroleum solvents would also be exempt from tax, even though these substances do not come in direct contact with the clothing being cleaned. The sale of soap or deter gents especially made for mixing with \"perch\" or petroleum solvents is exempt. The sale of stain removers to dry cleaners is exempt from tax. A commercial laundry' s purchase of deter gents, bleaches, and fabric softeners is exempt from tax. A commercial laundry' s purchase of water , which is a solvent, is also exempt from tax if purchased for use in the cleaning of clothing. The purchase of starch by laundries and \"sizing\" by dry cleaners is not exempt from tax. 18.47 (2) Also, on and after July 1, 1987, the sale of property which is a container , label, or similar article or receptacle for transfer in association with the maintenance or repair of fabric or clothing is exempt from tax. In general, the sale of any article which protects dry-cleaned or laundered clothing from dirt or helps the dry-cleaned or laundered clothing to maintain its proper shape or form in the same fashion as a container does would be exempt from tax under this subrule. By way of nonexclusive example, the sale of plastic garment bags, which protect clothing from dirt, is exempt from tax. The sale of \"shirt boards\" and garment hangers, both of which help clothing to maintain its proper shape, would also be exempt. A container , label, or similar article' s sale is exempt from tax only if the item is transferred to the customer of a commercial laundry , dry cleaner , or other retailer . Thus, \"bundle bags\" and \"meese carts,\" used to transfer or transport clothing within a dry-cleaning establishment, are not subject to the exemption because these bags and carts remain with the dry cleaner and are not transferred to a customer . Concerning labels, the sale of which would be exempt from tax, these labels must be af fixed to the dry-cleaned or laundered clothing and transferred to the customer of the dry-cleaning or laundering establishment. By way of nonexclusive example, the sale to dry cleaners, of \"special attention,\" \"invoice\" and \"sorry\" tags would be exempt from tax. The sale of safety pins and other types of clips used to hang skirts and other garments from hangers would not be exempt from tax. These items do not suf ficiently resemble containers or labels to the extent that their sale is exempt from tax. This rule is intended to implement Division IV of Iowa Code chapter 422 . 701\u201418. 48 (422,423) Sale or r ental of farm machinery , equipment, r eplacement parts, and r epairs used in livestock, dairy , or plant pr oduction. Sales or rental of farm machinery and equipment used in livestock or dairy production and replacement parts which occur on or after July 1, 1988, are exempt from sales and use tax. On and after July 1, 1995, machinery , equipment, and replacement parts used in the production of flowering, ornamental, or vegetable plants are exempt from tax. See rule 701\u201418.57 (422,423). 18.48 (1) Definitions and characterizations. For the purposes of this rule, the following definitions and characterizations of words apply . a. \"Machinery\" means major mechanical machines or major components thereof which contribute directly and primarily to the livestock or dairy production process. Usually , a machine is a lar ge object with moving parts which performs work by the expenditure of ener gy , either mechanical (e.g., gasoline or kerosene) or electrical. b. \"Equipment\" is tangible personal property (other than a machine) directly and primarily used in livestock or dairy production. It may be characterized as property which performs a specialized function which, of itself, has no moving parts or if it does possess moving parts, its source of power is external to it. The following examples attempt to dif ferentiate between machinery and equipment: E XAMPLE A. An electric pump is used to pump milk into a bulk milk tank. The electric pump is machinery; the bulk milk tank is equipment. Ch 18, p. 52 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 E XAMPLE B. An auger places feed into a property\" (see is a piece of machinery; the cattle feeder is a piece of equipment. c. Property used in livestock or dairy production which is neither \"equipment\" nor \"machinery .\" (1) Real property . The ground or the earth is not machinery or equipment. A building is not machinery or equipment, Mid-American Gr owers, Inc. v . Dept. of Revenue, 493 N.E.2d 1097 (Ill. App. Ct. 1986). Therefore, tangible personal property which is sold for incorporation into the ground or a building in such a manner that it will become a part of the ground or the building is taxable. Generally , property incorporated into the ground or a building has become a part of the ground or the building if removal of the property from the ground or building will substantially damage the property , ground, or building or substantially diminish the value of the property , ground, or building. Fence posts embedded in concrete and electrical wiring, light fixtures, fuse boxes, and switches are examples of property sold for incorporation into the ground or a building, respectively . The property referred to in 18.48(1) \"c\" (1) can be identified by applying the following test: Assume that the property is being sold to a contractor rather than a person engaged in livestock or dairy production. If sold to a contractor , would the retailer be required to consider the property \"building material\" and char ge the contractor sales tax upon the purchase of this building material. If this is the case, sale of the property is not exempt from Iowa tax law . Iowa department of revenue rule 701\u201419.3 (422,423) contains a characterization of \"building material\" and a list of specific examples of building material. (2) \"Supplies\" are neither machinery nor equipment. T angible personal property is part of farm supplies if it is used up or destroyed by virtue of its use in livestock or dairy production or , because of its nature, can only be used once in livestock or dairy production. A light bulb is an example of a farm supply which is not machinery or equipment. The sale of some farm supplies is exempt from tax. See 701\u2014subrule 17.9(3) . See List B in subrule 18.48(7) for examples of farm supplies which could be mistaken for equipment and are not exempt from tax on other grounds. d. \"Hand tools\" are tools which can be held in the hand or hands and which are powered by human ef fort. Hand tools specifically designed for use in livestock or dairy production are exempt from tax as \"equipment.\" Mechanical devices that are held in the hand and driven by electricity or some source other than human muscle power are, if otherwise qualified, exempt from tax as \"farm machinery .\" See subrule 18.48(7) , List C, for examples of \"hand tools\" exempt and not exempt from tax. e. Directly used in livestock or dairy production. T o determine if machinery or equipment is \"directly\" used in livestock or dairy production, one must first ensure that the machinery or equipment is used during livestock or dairy production and not before that process has begun or after it has ended. Subrule 18.48(1), paragraph \"g,\" describes when livestock or dairy production begins and ends. If the machinery or equipment is used in livestock or dairy production, to be \"directly\" so used, that use must constitute an integral and essential part of production as distinguished from a use in production which is incidental, merely convenient to or remote from production. The fact that machinery or equipment is essential or necessary to livestock or dairy production does not mean that it is also \"directly\" used in production. Machinery or equipment may be necessary to livestock or dairy production but so remote from it that it is not directly used in that production. (1) In determining whether machinery or equipment is used directly , consideration should be given to the following factors: 1. The physical proximity of the machinery or equipment to other machinery or equipment whose direct use is unar guable. The closer the machinery or equipment whose direct use is questioned is to the machinery or equipment whose direct use is not questioned, the more likely it is that the former is directly used in livestock or dairy production. 2. The proximity in time of the use of machinery or equipment whose direct use is questionable to the use of machinery whose direct use is not questioned. The closer in time the use, the more likely that the questioned machinery or equipment' s use is direct rather than remote. 3. The active causal relationship between the use of the machinery or equipment in question and livestock or dairy production. The fewer intervening causes between the use of the machinery or equipment and the production of the product, the more likely it is that the machinery or equipment is directly used in production. IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 53 (2) The following are examples of machinery and equipment directly used in livestock or dairy production: 1. Machinery and equipment used to transport or limit the movement of livestock and dairy animals (e.g., electric fence equipment, head gates, and loading chutes). 2. Machinery and equipment used in the conception, birth, feeding, and watering of livestock or dairy animals (e.g., artificial insemination equipment, portable farrowing pens, feed carts, and automatic watering equipment). 3. Machinery and equipment used to maintain healthful or sanitary conditions in the immediate area where livestock are kept (e.g., manure gutter cleaners, automatic cattle oilers, fans, and heaters if not real property). 4. Machinery or equipment used to test or inspect livestock or dairy animals during production. (3) The following are nonexclusive examples of machinery or equipment which would not be directly used in livestock or dairy production. 1. Machinery or equipment used to assemble, maintain, or repair other machinery or equipment directly used in livestock or dairy production (e.g., welders, paint sprayers, and lubricators). 2. Machinery used in farm management, administration, advertising, or selling (e.g., a recordkeeping computer , calculating machine, of fice safe, telephone, books, and farm magazines). 3. Machinery or equipment used in the exhibit of livestock or dairy animals (e.g., blankets, halters, prods, leads, and harnesses). 4. Machinery or equipment used in safety or fire prevention, even though the machinery or equipment is required by law . 5. Machinery or equipment for employee or personal use. Machinery or equipment used for the personal comfort, convenience, or use by a farmer , the farmer ' s family or employees, or persons associated with the farmer are not exempt from tax. Examples of such machinery and equipment include the following: beds, mattresses, blankets, tableware, stoves, refrigerators, and other equipment used in conjunction with the operation of a farm home or of a migrant labor camp, or other facilities for farm employees. 6. Machinery and equipment used for heating, cooling, ventilation, and illumination of farm buildings generally rather than specifically in the immediate area where livestock are kept. 7. V ehicles subject to registration. f. \"Primarily\" used in livestock or dairy production. Machinery or equipment is \"primarily used in livestock or dairy production\" if of the total time that unit of machinery or equipment is used, more than 50 percent of the time is in livestock or dairy production. If a unit of machinery or equipment is used more than 50 percent of the time for production and the balance of time for other business purposes, the exemption applies. If a unit of equipment is used 50 percent or more of the time for business purposes other than livestock or dairy production, the exemption does not apply . Any unit of machinery or equipment used more than 50 percent of the time directly in livestock or dairy production is subject to the exemption. g. Beginning and end of livestock or dairy production. Livestock or dairy production begins with the purchase or breeding of livestock or dairy animals. Livestock and dairy production ceases when an animal or the product of an animal' s body (e.g., wool or milk) has been transported to the point where it will be sold by the farmer or processed. h. Farm machinery and equipment means machinery and equipment specifically designed for use in livestock and dairy production or equipment and machinery not specifically designed for this use but which are directly and primarily used in livestock or dairy production except for common or ordinary hand tools. See 18.48(1) \"d\" for a definition of \"hand tools.\" E XAMPLE . Farmer Jones raises livestock and fans must be used to cool the animals. Farmer Jones buys fans designed for use in a residence which he uses directly and solely to cool the livestock. The exemption applies. i. \"Self-propelled implement\" has the same meaning as in 701\u2014subrule 17.9(5), paragraph \"c\" where the term is defined to mean an implement which is capable of movement from one place to another under its own power . The term self-propelled implement includes but is not limited to the following Ch 18, p. 54 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 items: skidloaders and tractors; and the following machinery if capable of movement under its own power: combines, corn pickers, fertilizer spreaders, hay conditioners/windrowers, sprayers, and bean buggies. j. Implements customarily drawn or attached to self-propelled implements. The following is a nonexclusive, representative list of implements which are customarily drawn or attached to self-propelled implements: augers, balers, blowers, combines, conveyers, cultivators, plows, posthole diggers, rotary blade mowers, rotary hoes, sprayers and tanks, and tillage equipment. k. The term \"grain dryer\" includes the heater and the blower necessary to force the warmed air into a grain storage bin. It does not include equipment used in grain storage or movement such as augers and spreaders or any other equipment that is not a grain dryer . Equipment other than a grain dryer which is used in grain drying may be exempt or subject to refund if the equipment is a self-propelled implement or customarily drawn or attached to a self-propelled implement. l. The term \"replacement parts essential to any repair or reconstruction necessary to farm machinery or equipment' s exempt use in the production of agricultural products\" does not include attachments and accessories not essential to the operation of the machinery or equipment itself (except when sold as part of the assembled unit) such as cigarette lighters, radios, canopies, air conditioning units, cabs, deluxe seats, and tools or utility boxes. 18.48 (2) Right of r efund for farm machinery and equipment used in livestock or dairy pr oduction, basic r equir 10/13/93 , ef fective 1 1/17/93. 18.48 (4) Packing material used in agricultural, livestock, or dairy pr oduction. For sales occurring on or after July 1, 1996, the gross receipts from the sale of property which is a container , label, carton, pallet, packing case, wrapping, baling wire, twine, bag, bottle, shipping case, or other similar article or receptacle sold for use in agricultural, livestock, or dairy production are not subject to sales tax. This exemption also applies to producers of ornamental, flowering, or vegetable plants in commercial greenhouses or other places which sell such items in the ordinary course of business since that activity is considered to be agricultural. 18.48 (5) Rescinded IAB 1 1/20/96 , ef fective 12/25/96. 18.48 (6) Auxiliary attachments exemption. On and after July 1, 1995, sales of auxiliary attachments which improve the performance, safety , operation, or ef ficiency of machinery or equipment are exempt from tax. Sales of replacement parts for these auxiliary attachments are also exempt on and after that date. 18.48 (7) Lists.

The seller shall be relieved of sales tax liability if the seller takes from the purchaser an exemption certificate stating that the purchase is of machinery or equipment meeting the requirements of subrule 18.48(4) . An exemption certificate can take the form of a stamp imprinted onto one of the documents of sale. If items purchased tax-free pursuant to an exemption certificate are used or disposed of by the purchaser in a nonexempt manner , the purchaser is solely liable for the taxes and shall remit the tax directly to the department. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 422.45 as amended by 1996 Iowa Acts, chapter 1 145 . 701\u201418. 49 (422,423) Air craft sales, r ental, component parts, and services exemptions prior to, on, and after July 1, 1999. 18.49 (1) Prior to July 1, 1999, sales in Iowa of aircraft subject to registration were subject to sales tax. On and after July 1, 1999, sales of aircraft in Iowa are subject to Iowa use tax rather than Iowa sales tax. See rule 701\u201431.6 (423). Also, on and after that date, the use tax imposed on sales of aircraft in Iowa is collected by the Iowa department of transportation at the time of the aircraft' s registration. Sales of certain aircraft parts in Iowa, the performance of taxable services in Iowa on or in connection with the repair , remodeling, or maintenance of aircraft, and the rental of aircraft in Iowa remain subject to Iowa sales tax on and after July 1, 1999. See subrule 18.49(3) . 18.49 (2) For the purposes of this subrule only , an \"aircraft\" is any contrivance known or hereafter invented which is designed for navigation of or flight in the air and is used in a scheduled interstate Federal A viation Administration certified air carrier operation. a. Exempt air craft sales. As of July 1, 1988, and up to and including June 30, 1999, gross receipts from the sale of aircraft are exempt from tax. b. Exempt r ental of air craft. Ef fective May 1, 1995, and retroactive to July 1, 1988, the taxable rental (see 701\u201426.74 (422,423)) of aircraft, as defined in the introductory paragraph of this subrule, is exempt from tax. c. Exempt sale or r ental of air craft parts. Ef fective May 1, 1995, and retroactive to July 1, 1988, gross receipts from the sale or rental of tangible personal property permanently af fixed to any aircraft as a component part of that aircraft are exempt from tax.

Ef fective May 1, 1995, and retroactive to July 1, 1988, gross receipts from the rendering, furnishing, or performing of services in connection with the repair , remodeling, or maintenance of aircraft (including aircraft engines and component materials or parts) are exempt from tax. 18.49 (3) For the purposes of this subrule only , an \"aircraft\" is any aircraft used in a nonscheduled interstate Federal A viation Administration certified air carrier operation conducted under 14 CFR ch. 1, pt. 135. On and after July 1, 1998, the gross receipts from the sale or rental of tangible personal property permanently af fixed or permanently attached as a component part of these aircraft, including but not limited to repair or replacement materials or parts, are exempt from tax. Also exempt, on and after that date, are the gross receipts from the performance of any service used for aircraft repair , remodeling, or maintenance when the service is performed on an aircraft, aircraft engine, or aircraft component material or part exempt under this subrule. Gross receipts from the sale or rental of aircraft are not exempt from tax under this subrule. 18.49 (4) For the purposes of this subrule only , an \"aircraft\" is any contrivance known or hereafter invented which is designed for navigation of or flight in the air . On and after July 1, 1998, and up to and including June 30, 1999, the gross receipts from the sale of an aircraft to an aircraft dealer who rents or leases the aircraft to another are exempt from tax if all of the following circumstances exist: a. The aircraft is kept in the inventory of the dealer for sale at all times. b. The dealer reserves the right to immediately take the aircraft from the renter or lessee when a buyer is found. c. The renter or lessee is aware that the dealer will immediately take the aircraft when a buyer is found. Ch 18, p. 58 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 As soon as an aircraft, the sale of which is exempt under this subrule, is used for any purpose other than leasing or renting, or the conditions set out in paragraphs \"a,\" \"b,\" and \"c\" are not continuously met, the dealer claiming the exemption is liable for the tax which would have been due but for the exemption set out in this subrule. T ax will be computed on the original purchase price paid by the dealer . See rule 701\u201432.13 (423) for a description of the manner in which transactions described in this subrule are exempted from tax on and after July 1, 1999. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 422.45, subsections 38, 38A, 38B and 38C and Iowa Code section 423.2 as amended by 1999 Iowa Acts, chapter 168 . 701\u201418. 50 (422,423) Pr operty used by a lending organization.

Contractors or farmers entitled to the exemption set forth in the previous paragraph may apply for a refund of taxes, interest or penalties paid on the sale or rental of qualifying irrigation equipment for transactions that occurred between April 1, 1995, and May 18, 2001. T o be eligible for refund, refund claims must be filed with the department prior to October 1, 2001. Refund claims are limited to $25,000 in the aggregate and will not be allowed if not timely filed. If the amount of refund claims totals more than $25,000 in the aggregate, the department will prorate the $25,000 among all claimants in relation to the amounts of the claimants' valid claims. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 422.45 and 2001 Iowa Acts, House File 723 . 701\u201418. 53 (422,423) Sales to persons engaged in the consumer r ental pur chase business. On and after July 1, 1989, the gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property , except vehicles subject to registration, to persons regularly engaged in the consumer purchase business are exempt from tax if the property (1) is sold for the purpose of utilization in a transaction involving a \"consumer rental purchase agreement\" as defined in Iowa Code subsection 537.3604(8) , and (2) the gross receipts from the consumer rental of the property are subject to Iowa sales or use tax. If property exempt under this rule is made use of for any purpose other than a consumer rental purchase, the person claiming the exemption is liable for the tax that would have been due had the exemption not existed. The tax shall be computed on the original purchase price to the person claiming IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 59 the exemption.

For the purposes of this rule \"advertising material\" is tangible personal property only , including paper . \"Advertising material\" is limited to the following: brochures, catalogs, leaflets, fliers, order forms, return envelopes, floppy discs, CD-ROMs, videotapes, and any similar items of tangible personal property which will be used to promote sales of property or services. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 422.45 . 701\u201418. 55 (422,423) Dr op shipment sales. A \"drop shipment\" generally involves two sales transactions and three parties. The first party is a consumer located inside Iowa. The second party is a retailer located outside the state. The third party is a supplier who may be located inside or outside of Iowa. The two sales transactions in question are the sale of property from the supplier to the out-of-state retailer , and the further sale of that property from the out-of-state retailer to the consumer in Iowa. A \"drop shipment sale\" occurs when the consumer places an order for the purchase of tangible personal property with the out-of-state retailer . The retailer does not own the property ordered at the same time the consumer ' s order is placed. The retailer then purchases the property from the supplier . The supplier in turn ships the property directly to the consumer in Iowa. Under Iowa law the supplier in a drop shipment sale cannot be required to collect tax (either sales or use) from the consumer , even if the requisite \"nexus\" to require collection exists. See the next to last paragraph of this rule for a characterization of \"nexus.\" The supplier transfers possession of the goods to the consumer; however , transfer of possession alone has never been held to be a \"sale\" for the purposes of Iowa sales and use tax law . Sturtz v . Iowa Department of Revenue, 373 N.W .2d 131 (Iowa 1985) and Cedar V alley Leasing v . Iowa Department of Revenue, 274 N.W .2d 357 (Iowa 1979). W ith reference to drop shipment sales: If delivery of the goods under the contract for sale has occurred outside of Iowa, sale of the goods has occurred outside of Iowa. If delivery of the goods under the contract for sale has occurred within Iowa, the sale has occurred here. See Sturtz above for more information regarding sales and delivery . If the sale has occurred in Iowa and the retailer possesses the requisite nexus to require it to collect Iowa tax, the retailer is obligated to collect Iowa sales tax upon the \"gross receipts\" from its sale of the goods to the consumer . If the sale has occurred outside this state, and the retailer possesses the nexus to require it to collect Iowa tax, the retailer is obligated to collect Iowa retailer ' s use tax upon the purchase price of the goods. If the retailer does not have nexus suf ficient to require it to collect either Iowa sales or Iowa use tax, or if the retailer fails to collect either tax, the consumer is obligated to pay a consumer use tax directly to the department upon the purchase price of the goods. These rules are illustrated in the following examples. E XAMPLE A: A consumer in Des Moines, Iowa, purchases goods from a retailer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Minneapolis retailer contracts with a supplier in Iowa to manufacture and ship the goods to the consumer . The retailer has nexus with Iowa, and delivery under the contract for sale has occurred in this state. In this case, the consumer is obligated to pay and the retailer is obligated to collect Iowa sales tax. The supplier is not obligated to collect any Iowa tax. E XAMPLE B: A consumer in Des Moines, Iowa, purchases goods from a retailer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Minnesota retailer contracts with a supplier in Iowa to manufacture and ship the goods to the consumer . The retailer has no nexus with Iowa. Delivery under the contract of sale is in Iowa. Under these circumstances, the consumer is obligated to pay consumer ' s use tax directly to the department. Neither the retailer nor the supplier is obligated to collect any Iowa tax. E XAMPLE C: A consumer in Des Moines, Iowa, purchases goods from a retailer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The retailer contracts with a supplier in Minneapolis to manufacture and ship the goods to Ch 18, p. 60 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 the consumer in Des Moines. The retailer has nexus with Iowa, and delivery under the contract for sale occurs in Iowa. Under these circumstances, the consumer is obligated to pay and the retailer is obligated to collect Iowa sales tax. The supplier is not obligated to collect any Iowa tax. E XAMPLE D: A consumer in Des Moines, Iowa, purchases goods from a retailer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The retailer contracts with a supplier in Minneapolis to manufacture and ship the goods to the consumer in Des Moines. The retailer has nexus with this state; delivery under the contract for sale is in Minnesota. Under the circumstances, the consumer is obligated to pay and the retailer is obligated to collect Iowa retailer ' s use tax. The supplier is not obligated to collect or pay any Iowa tax. E XAMPLE E: A consumer in Des Moines, Iowa, purchases goods from a retailer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The retailer contracts with a supplier in Minneapolis to manufacture and ship the goods to the consumer in Des Moines. The retailer has no nexus with this state. Delivery can occur in either Minnesota or Iowa. In this example, the consumer is obligated to pay Iowa consumer ' s use tax directly to the department. Neither the retailer nor the supplier is obligated to collect any Iowa tax. E XAMPLE F: A consumer in Des Moines, Iowa, purchases goods from a retailer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The retailer contracts with a supplier located in Madison, W isconsin, to ship the goods to the consumer in Des Moines. The retailer has nexus with Iowa, and delivery under the contract for sale is in Iowa. Under these circumstances, the retailer is obligated to collect and the consumer obligated to pay Iowa sales tax. The supplier is not obligated to collect any Iowa tax. E XAMPLE G: A consumer in Des Moines, Iowa, purchases goods from a retailer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The retailer contracts with a supplier located in Madison, W isconsin, to ship the goods to the consumer in Des Moines. The retailer has nexus with Iowa with delivery in Madison, W isconsin. Under these circumstances, the retailer is obligated to collect and the consumer obligated to pay Iowa retailer ' s use tax. The supplier is not obligated to collect any Iowa tax. E XAMPLE H: A consumer in Des Moines, Iowa, purchases goods from a retailer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The retailer contracts with a supplier located in Madison, W isconsin, to ship the goods to the consumer in Des Moines. The retailer has no nexus with Iowa. Delivery under the contract for sale may be in Iowa or W isconsin. Under these circumstances, the consumer is obligated to pay Iowa consumer ' s use tax directly to the department. Neither the retailer nor the supplier is obligated to collect any Iowa tax. As used in these examples, the requirement of \"nexus\" is discussed in Good' s Furnitur e House Inc. v . Iowa State Bd. of T ax Review , 382 N.W .2d 145 (Iowa 1986); cert. den. 479 U.S. 817; State T ax Commission v . General T rading Co., 10 N.W U.S. 335, 88 L.Ed. 1309; and Nelson v .

On and after July 1, 1993, the gross receipts from the sale of property used to convert wind ener gy to electrical ener gy or the gross receipts from the sale of materials used to manufacture, install, or construct property used to convert wind ener gy to electrical ener gy shall be exempt from tax. For the purposes of this rule, \"property used to convert wind ener gy to electrical ener gy\" means any device which converts wind ener gy to usable electrical ener gy including, but not limited to, wind char gers, windmills, wind turbines, pad mount transformers, substations, power lines, and tower equipment. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 422.45 as amended by 1993 Iowa Acts, chapter 161 . 701\u201418. 57 (422,423) Exemptions applicable to the pr oduction of flowering, ornamental, and vegetable plants. On and after July 1, 1995, the production of flowering, ornamental, or vegetable plants by a grower in a commercial greenhouse or at another location is considered to be a part of agricultural production. The word \"plants\" does not include trees, shrubs, other woody perennials, IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 61 or fungus. The exemption also applies to implements, machinery , equipment, and replacement parts directly and primarily used in the production of flowering, ornamental, or vegetable plants and fuel used for providing heating or cooling for greenhouses or buildings or parts of buildings dedicated to the production of flowering, ornamental, or vegetable plants intended for sale in the ordinary course of business. The following exemptions are applicable to the production of flowering, ornamental, or vegetable plants. 18.57 (1) Sales of fertilizer , limestone, herbicides, pesticides, insecticides, plant food, and medication for use in disease, weed, insect control, or other health promotion of flowering, ornamental, or vegetable plants to a commercial greenhouse are exempt from tax. For the purposes of this subrule a virus, bacteria, fungus, or insect which is purchased for use in killing insects or other pests is an \"insecticide\" or \"pesticide.\" See rules 701\u2014226.6 (423) and 701\u201417.9 (422,423) for more information regarding these exemptions. 18.57 (2) Sales of fuel to provide heating or cooling for a greenhouse or building or a part of a building dedicated to the production of flowering, ornamental, or vegetable plants held for sale in the ordinary course of business are exempt from tax. Electricity is a \"fuel\" for the purposes of this subrule. Fuel used in a plant production building for purposes other than heating or cooling (e.g., lighting) or for purposes other than direct use in plant production (e.g., heating or cooling of fice space) is not eligible for this exemption. For example, assume that there is a separate meter for electricity used only for heating or cooling. If a greenhouse is used, partially for growing plants and partially for a nonexempt purpose, a proportional exemption from sales tax may be claimed based upon a percentage calculated from a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of square feet of the greenhouse heated or cooled and used for raising plants, and the denominator of which is the number of square feet heated or cooled in the entire greenhouse. It may be necessary to alter this formula (by the use of separate metering, for example) if a greenhouse has a walk-in cooler and the cooler is used directly in plant production. Plant production has ended when a plant has grown to the point that it is of the size or weight at which it will be prepared for shipment to the destination where it will be marketed. Examples of nonexempt purposes for which a portion of a greenhouse might be used include, but are not limited to, portions used for of fice space, loading docks, storage of property other than plants, housing of heating and cooling equipment and portions used for packaging plants for shipment. See rule 701\u201415.3 (422,423) regarding fuel exemption certificates and subrule 18.48(8) regarding seller ' s and purchaser ' s liability for sales tax. 18.57 (3) Sales of gas, electricity , steam or other tangible personal property for use as a fuel in implements of husbandry used in the production of plants in a commercial greenhouse or elsewhere are exempt from tax. See 701\u2014subrule 17.9(6) , paragraph \"a,\" for a definition of \"implements of husbandry .\" 18.57 (4) Sales of self-propelled implements. Sales of self-propelled implements or implements customarily drawn by or attached to self-propelled implements and replacement parts for the same are exempt from tax if the implements are used directly and primarily in the production of plants in commercial greenhouses or elsewhere. See rule 701\u201418.44 (422,423) for an extensive explanation of this exemption. Implements exempt under this subrule include, but are not limited to, forklifts used to transport pallets of plants; wagons containing sterilized soil and tractors used to pull the same. 18.57 (5) Sale of water used in the production of plants is exempt from tax. If water is not separately metered, the grower of plants must determine by use of a percentage that portion which is used for a taxable purpose and that portion which is used for an exempt purpose. Nonexclusive examples of taxable usage would be rest rooms, sanitation, lawns, and vehicle wash. 18.57 (6) For sales occurring on or after July 1, 1996, the gross receipts for the sale of property which is a container , label, carton, pallet, packing case, wrapping, baling wire, twine, bag, bottle, shipping case, or other similar article or receptacle sold for use in agricultural, livestock, or dairy production are not subject to sales tax. This exemption also applies to producers of ornamental, flowering, or vegetable plants in commercial greenhouses or other places which sell such items in the ordinary course of business since that activity is considered to be agricultural. A noninclusive list of containers and packaging materials would include boxes, trays, labels, sleeves, tape, and staples. Ch 18, p. 62 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 18.57 (7) Sales of machinery and equipment used in plant production which are not self-propelled or attached to self-propelled machinery and equipment are also exempt from tax. See rule 701\u201418.48 (422,423) for a thorough explanation of this exemption. Listed below are a number of examples of machinery and equipment which are directly and primarily used in plant production. Sales of this machinery and equipment to commercial growers are usually exempt from tax. Air -conditioning pads* Airflow control tubes Atmospheric CO 2 control and monitoring equipment Backup generators Bins holding sterilized soil Control panels = heating and cooling Coolers used to chill plants* Cooling walls* or membranes Equipment used to control water levels for subirrigation Fans = cooling and ventilating* Floor mesh for controlling weeds Germination chambers Greenhouse boilers* Greenhouse netting or mesh = used for light and heat control Greenhouse monorail systems* Greenhouse thermometers Handcarts used to move plants Lighting which provides artificial sunlight Overhead heating, lighting and watering systems Overhead tracks for holding potted plants* Plant tables* Plant watering systems* Portable buildings used to grow plants* Seeding and transplanting machines Soil pot and soil flat filling machines Steam generators for soil sterilization* W arning devices = excess heat or cold W atering booms *If not real property . See 18.48(1) \"c\" (1). 18.57 (8) Miscellaneous exempt and taxable sales. Sales of pots, soil, seeds, bulbs, and \"starter plants\" for use in plant production are not the sale of machinery or equipment, but can be sales for resale and exempt from tax if the pots and soil are sold with the final product or become the finished product. Sales of portable buildings which will be used to display plants for retail sales are taxable. Finally , sales of whitewash which will be painted on greenhouses to control the amount of sunlight entering those houses are taxable sales of a \"supply\" rather than exempt sales of equipment. See 18.48(1) \"c\" (2) relating to \"supplies.\" See rule 701\u201418.7 (422,423) relating to containers, including packaging cases, shipping cases, wrapping materials, and similar items sold to retailers, and see subrule 18.57(6) . This rule is intended to implement , 422.42(4) , 422.42(1 Iowa Code section 422.45 as amended by 1996 Iowa Acts, chapter 1 145 . [ ARC 41 17C Exempt sales or r entals of computers, industrial machinery and equipment, and exempt sales of fuel and electricity on and after July 1, 1997, but befor e July 1, 2016. The sale or rental of machinery , equipment, or computers used by a manufacturer in processing; the sale or rental of a computer used in the processing or storage of data or information by an insurance company , financial institution, or commercial enterprise; and the sale or rental of various other types of tangible personal IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 63 property are, under certain circumstances, exempt from tax as of July 1, 1997, but before July 1, 2016. For sales that occur on or after July 1, 2016, see rules 701\u2014230.14(423) to 701\u2014230.22 (423). 18.58 (1) Definitions. The following terms are defined for the purposes of this rule in the manner set out below . \" Commer cial enterprise \" includes businesses and manufacturers conducted for profit and includes centers for data processing services to insurance companies, financial institutions, businesses, and manufacturers, but excludes professions and occupations and nonprofit or ganizations. A hospital that is a not-for -profit or ganization would not be a \"commercial enterprise.\" The term \"professions\" means a vocation or employment requiring specialized knowledge and often long and intensive academic preparation. The term \"occupations\" means the principal business of an individual. Included within the meaning of \"occupations\" is the business of farming. A professional corporation which carries on any business which is a \"profession\" or \"occupation\" is not a commercial enterprise. \" Contract manufactur er \" is any manufacturer who falls within the definition of \"manufacturer\" set out subsequently in this subrule except that a contract manufacturer does not sell the tangible personal property which it processes on behalf of other manufacturers. \" Dir ectly used. \" Property is \"directly used\" only if it is used to initiate, sustain, or terminate an exempt activity . In determining whether any property is \"directly used,\" consideration should be given to the following factors: 1. The physical proximity of the property in question to the activity in which it is used; 2. The proximity of the time of use of the property in question to the time of use of other property used before and after it in the activity involved; and 3. The active causal relationship between the use of the property in question and the activity involved. The fact that a particular piece of property may be essential to the conduct of the activity because its use is required either by law or practical necessity does not, of itself, mean that the property is directly used. \" Financial institution \" is a bank incorporated under any state or federal law; a savings and loan association incorporated under any state or federal law; a credit union or ganized under any state or federal law; or any corporation licensed as an industrial loan company under Iowa Code chapter 536A . Excluded from the meaning of the term are loan brokers governed by Iowa Code chapter 535C and production credit associations. \" Insurance company \" means an insurer or ganized or operating under Iowa Code chapter or 520 or authorized to do business in Iowa as an insurer or as a licensed insurance agent under Iowa Code chapter 522 . Excluded from the definition of \"insurance company\" are fraternal and beneficial societies governed by Iowa Code chapter 512 and health maintenance or ganizations governed by Iowa Code chapter 514B . This list of exclusions is not intended to be exclusive. \" Machinery and equipment \" means machinery and equipment used by a manufacturer . Machinery is any mechanical, electrical, or electronic device designed and used to perform some function and to produce a certain ef fect or result. The term includes not only the basic unit of the machinery , but also any adjunct or attachment necessary for the basic unit to accomplish its intended function. The term also includes all devices used or required to control, regulate, or operate a piece of machinery , provided such devices are directly connected with or are an integral part of the machinery and are used primarily for control, regulation, or operation of machinery . Jigs, dies, tools, and other devices necessary to the operation of or used in conjunction with the operation of what would be ordinarily thought of as machinery are also considered to be \"machinery .\" See Deer e Manufacturing Co. v . Zeiner , 247 Iowa 1264, 78 N.W .2d Also see the definition of \"replacement parts\" infra. Machinery does not include buildings designed specifically to house or support machinery . Equipment is any tangible personal property used in an operation or activity . Nonexclusive examples of equipment are tables on which property is assembled on an assembly line and chairs used by assembly line workers. \" Manufactur er \" means any person, firm, or corporation that purchases, receives, or holds personal property for the purpose of adding to its value by any process of manufacturing, refining, purifying, combining of dif ferent materials, or by packing of meats with an intent to sell at a gain or profit. Those who are in the business of printing, newspaper publication, bookbinding, lumber milling, and production Ch 18, p. 64 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 of drugs and agricultural supplies are illustrative, nonexclusive examples of manufacturers. Construction contracting; remanufacture or rebuilding of tangible personal property (such as automobile engines); provision of health care; farming; transportation for hire; and the activities of restaurateurs, hospitals, medical doctors, and those who merely process data are illustrative, nonexclusive examples of businesses which are not manufacturers. See Associated General Contractors of Iowa v . State T ax Commission, 255 Iowa 673, 123 N.W .2d 922 (1963) and River Pr oducts Co. v . Boar d of Review of W ashington County , 332 N.W .2d 1 16 (Iowa Ct. App. 1982). The term \"manufacturer\" includes a contract manufacturer . Ordinarily , the word does not include those commercial enterprises engaged in quarrying or mining. However , ef fective July 1, 1998, a commercial enterprise, the principal business of which is quarrying or mining, is a manufacturer with respect to activities in which it engages subsequent to quarrying or mining. These subsequent activities include, by way of nonexclusive example, crushing, washing, sizing, and blending of aggregate materials. E XAMPLE : Company A owns and operates a gravel pit. It sells the gravel extracted from the pit to others who use the gravel for surfacing roads and as an ingredient in concrete manufacture. Company A removes overlay and raw gravel from the pit. It then transports the gravel to a plant where washing and sizing of the gravel take place. Company A is a manufacturer , but only with respect to those activities which occur after it severs the gravel from the ground. \" Pollution contr ol equipment \" means any disposal system or apparatus used or placed in operation primarily for the purpose of reducing, controlling, or eliminating air or water pollution. The term does not include any apparatus used to eliminate \"noise pollution.\" Liquid, solid, and gaseous wastes are included within the meaning of the word \"pollution.\" \"Pollution control equipment\" specifically includes, but is not limited to, any equipment the use of which is required or certified by an agency of this state or the United States Government. W astewater treatment facilities and scrubbers used in smokestacks are examples of pollution control equipment. However , pollution control equipment does not include any equipment used only for worker safety (e.g., a gas mask). \" Pr ocessing \" means a series of operations in which materials are manufactured, refined, purified, created, combined, transformed, or stored by a manufacturer , ultimately into tangible personal property . Processing encompasses all activities commencing with the receipt or producing of raw materials by the manufacturer and ending at the point products are delivered for shipment or transferred from the manufacturer . Processing includes, but is not limited to, refinement or purification of materials; treatment of materials to change their form, context, or condition; maintenance of the quality or integrity of materials, components, or products; maintenance of environmental conditions necessary for materials, components or products; quality control activities; construction of packaging and shipping devices; placement into shipping containers or any type of shipping device or medium; and the movement of materials, components, or products until shipment from the manufacturer . \" Pr ocessing or storage of data or information. \" All computers store and process information. However , only if the \"final output\" for a user or consumer is stored or processed data will the computer be eligible for exemption of tax. \" Receipt or pr oducing of raw materials \" means activities performed upon tangible personal property only . W ith respect to raw materials produced from or upon real estate, \"production of raw materials\" is deemed to occur immediately following the severance of the raw materials from the real estate. \" Recycling \" means any process by which waste or materials which would otherwise become waste are collected, separated, or processed and revised or returned for use in the form of raw materials or products. The term includes, but is not limited to, the composting of yard waste which has been previously separated from other waste. \"Recycling\" does not include any form of ener gy recovery . \" Replacement parts. \" A \"replacement part\" is any machinery , equipment, or computer part which is substituted for another part that has broken, has become worn out or obsolete, or is otherwise unable to perform its intended function. \"Replacement parts\" are those parts which materially add to the value of industrial machinery , equipment, or computers or appreciably prolong their lives or keep them in their ordinarily ef ficient operating condition. Excluded from the meaning of the term \"replacement parts\" are supplies, the use of which is necessary if machinery is to accomplish its intended function. Drill bits, IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 65 grinding wheels, punches, taps, reamers, saw blades, lubricants, coolants, sanding discs, sanding belts, and air filters are nonexclusive examples of supplies. Sales of supplies remain taxable. T angible personal property with an expected useful life of 12 months or more which is used in the operation of machinery , equipment, or computers is rebuttably presumed to be a \"replacement part.\" T angible personal property used in the same manner with an expected useful life of less than 12 months is rebuttably presumed to be a \"supply .\" \" Resear ch and development \" means experimental or laboratory activity which has as its ultimate goal the development of new products or processes of processing. Machinery , equipment, and computers are used \"directly\" in research and development only if they are used in actual experimental or laboratory activity that qualifies as research and development under this subrule. 18.58 (2) Exempt sales. On and after July 1, 1997, sales or rentals of the following machinery , equipment, or computers (including replacement parts) are exempt from tax: a. Machinery , equipment, and computers directly and primarily used in processing by a manufacturer . b. Machinery , equipment, and computers directly and primarily used to maintain a manufactured product' s integrity or to maintain any unique environmental conditions required for the product. c. Machinery , equipment and computers directly and primarily used to maintain unique environmental conditions required for other machinery , equipment, or computers used in processing by a manufacturer . d. T est equipment directly and primarily used by a manufacturer in processing to control the quality and specifications of a product. e. Machinery , equipment, or computers directly and primarily used in research and development of new products or processes of processing. f. Computers used in processing or storage of data or information by an insurance company , financial institution, or commercial enterprise. g. Machinery , equipment, and computers directly and primarily used in recycling or reprocessing of waste products. h. Pollution control equipment used by a manufacturer . It is not necessary that the equipment be \"directly and primarily\" used in any kind of processing. i. Materials used to construct or self-construct any machinery , equipment, or computer , the sale of which is exempted by paragraphs \"a\" through \"h\" above. j. Exempt sales of fuel and electricity . Sales of fuel or electricity consumed by machinery , equipment, or computers used in any exempt manner described in paragraphs \"a,\" \"b,\" \"c,\" \"d,\" \"e,\" \"g,\" and \"h\" of this subrule are exempt from tax. Sales of electricity consumed by computers used in the manner described in paragraph \"f\" remain subject to tax. 18.58 (3) Examples of exempt items. Sales of the following nonexclusive types of machinery and equipment, previously taxable, are exempt on and after July 1, 1997, if that machinery or equipment is sold for direct and primary use in processing by a manufacturer: coolers which do not change the nature of materials stored in them; equipment which eliminates bacteria; palletizers; storage bins; property used to transport raw , semifinished, or finished goods; vehicle-mounted cement mixers; self-constructed machinery and equipment; packaging and bagging equipment (including conveyer systems); equipment which maintains an environment necessary to preserve a product' s integrity; equipment which maintains a product' s integrity directly; quality control equipment and electricity or other fuel used to power the machinery and equipment mentioned above. 18.58 (4) Pr ocessing\u2014beginning to end. a. The beginning of pr ocessing. Processing begins with a manufacturer ' s receipt or production of raw material. Thus, when a manufacturer produces its own raw material it is engaged in processing. Processing also begins when raw materials are transferred to a manufacturer ' s possession by a manufacturer ' s supplier . b. The completion of pr ocessing. Processing ends when the finished product is transferred from the manufacturer or delivered for shipment by the manufacturer . Therefore, a manufacturer ' s packaging, Ch 18, p. 66 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 storage, and transport of a finished product after the product is in the form in which it will be sold at retail are part of the processing of the product. c. Examples of the beginning, intervening steps, and the ending of pr ocessing. Of the following, Examples A and B illustrate when processing begins under various circumstances; Example C demonstrates the middle stages of processing; and Example D demonstrates when the end of processing takes place. E XAMPLE A. Company A manufactures fine furniture. Company A owns a grove of walnut trees which it uses as raw material. A ' s employees cut the trees, transport the logs to A ' s factory , of fload them there, and store the logs in a warehouse (to begin the curing of their wood) before taking them to A ' s sawmill. The walnut trees are real property , Kennedy v . Boar d of Assessment and Review , 276 N.W . 205, 224 Iowa 405 (1937). Thus, no \"production of raw materials\" has occurred with regard to the trees until they have been severed from the soil and transformed into logs. In this example, \"processing\" of the logs begins when they are placed on vehicles for transport to A ' s factory . However , note that even though the transport vehicles are used in processing, if they are \"vehicles subject to registration,\" their use is not exempt from tax. See 18.58(6) \"d\" infra. E XAMPLE B. Company A from the previous example also buys mahogany logs from a supplier in Honduras. Company A uses its own equipment to of fload the logs from railroad cars at its manufacturing facility and then transports, stores, and saws the logs as previously described in Example A. Processing begins when Company A of floads the logs from the railroad cars. E XAMPLE C. Company C is a microbrewery . It uses a variety of kettles, vats, tanks, tubs, and other containers to mix, cook, ferment, settle, age, and store the beer which it brews. It also uses a variety of pipes and pumps to move the beer among the various containers involved in the activity of brewing. All stages of this brewing are part of processing whether those stages involve the transformation of the raw materials from one state to another , e.g., fermentation or aging, or simply involve holding the materials in an existing state, e.g., storage of hops in a bin or storage of the beer immediately prior to bottling. Also, any movement of the beer between containers is an activity which is a part of processing, whether this movement is an \"integral part\" of the production of the beer or not. E XAMPLE D. After the brewing process is complete, Company C places its beer in various containers, stores it, and moves the beer to its customers by a common carrier that picks up the beer at C' s brewery . C' s activities of placing the beer into bottles, cans, and kegs, storing it after packaging, and moving the beer by use of a forklift to the common carrier ' s pickup site are activities which are part of processing. 18.58 (5) V arious unr elated inclusions in and exclusions fr om this exemption. a. The following are nonexclusive examples of machinery which is not directly used in processing: (1) Machinery used exclusively for the comfort of workers. Examples are air cooling, air conditioning, and ventilation systems. (2) Machinery used in support operations, such as a machine shop, in which production machinery is assembled, maintained, or repaired. (3) Machinery used by administrative, accounting, and personnel departments. (4) Machinery used by plant security , fire prevention, first aid, and hospital stations. (5) Machinery used in plant communications and safety . b. The following is an example of property directly used in research and development. Frontier Hybrid, Inc. maintains a research and development laboratory for use in developing a corn plant which is a perennial. It purchases the following items for use in its research and development laboratory: a computer which will process data relating to the genetic structure of the various corn plants which Frontier Hybrid is testing, an electron microscope for examining the structure of corn plant genes, a \"steam cleaner\" for cleaning rugs in the laboratory of fices, and a typewriter for use by the laboratory director ' s secretary . The computer and the microscope are \"directly\" used in the research in which the laboratory is engaged; the steam cleaner and the typewriter only indirectly used. Therefore, purchase of the computer and microscope would be exempt from tax; purchase of the steam cleaner and typewriter would be subject to tax. c. The following is an example of computers used and not used in processing or storage of information or data. A health insurance company has four computers. Computer A is used to monitor IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 67 the temperature within the insurance company' s building. The computer transmits messages to the building' s heating and cooling systems telling them when to raise or lower the level of heating or air conditioning as needed. Computer B is used to store patient records and will recall those records on demand. Computer C is used to tabulate statistics regarding the amount of premiums paid in and the amount of benefits paid out for various classes of insured. Computer D is used to train the insurance company' s employees to perform various additional tasks or to better perform work they can already do. Computer D uses various canned programs to accomplish this. The \"final output\" of Computer A is neither stored nor processed information. Therefore, Computer A does not fit the definition of an exempt computer . The final output of Computer B is stored information. The final output of Computer C is processed information. The final output of Computer D is processed information consisting of the training exercises appearing on the computer monitor . The sale, lease, or use of Computers B, C, and D would qualify for exemption. d. The following is an example of property not used in processing. A manufacturing plant located in W arren County which manufactures widgets fabricates its own patterns used in manufacturing the widgets on a metal press machine in its machine shop located in Story County . The machine shop does not sell the patterns, and the metal press machine is used for no other purpose than to fabricate the patterns. The metal press machine is not used in processing because there is no intent to sell the patterns used by the machine shop at a gain or profit. 18.58 (6) Exceptions. Sales of the following machinery , equipment, or computers are not exempt: a. Machinery , equipment, or computers assessed by the department of revenue pursuant to Iowa Code chapters 428 , 433 , 434 , and 436 to 438 , inclusive. For electric, gas, water , and other companies assessed under Iowa Code chapter 428 , only property owned by the company is assessed by the department. For railroad, telephone, pipeline, and electric transmission lines companies, property leased to, as well as owned by , the company is assessed by the department. See 701\u2014Chapters 71 and 77 . b. Hand tools. These are tools which can be held in the hand or hands and which are powered by human ef fort. c. Point-of-sale equipment. See 701\u2014subrule 71.1(7) . d. V ehicles subject to registration, except vehicles subject to registration which are directly and primarily used in recycling or reprocessing of waste products. e. Machinery and equipment purchased by a person engaged in processing who is not a manufacturer . Restaurants, retail bakeries, food stores, and blacksmith shops are nonexclusive examples of businesses which process tangible personal property but are not manufacturers as that word is defined for the purposes of this rule. f. The fact that the acquisition cost of rented or purchased machinery , equipment, or computers can be capitalized for the purposes of Iowa or federal income tax law is not an indication that their sale or rental would be exempt from tax under this rule. 18.58 (7) Lessor pur chases of machinery , equipment, or computers. The analysis regarding lessor purchases of farm machinery and equipment contained in subrule 18.44(3) explains that same problem regarding machinery , equipment, and computers. 18.58 (8) Designing or installing new industrial machinery or equipment. The gross receipts from the services of designing or installing new industrial machinery or equipment are exempt from tax. The enumerated services of electrical or electronic installation are included in this exemption. T o qualify for the exemption, the sale or rental of the machinery or equipment must be subject to exemption under this rule. In addition, the machinery or equipment must be \"new .\" For purposes of this subrule, \"new\" means never having been used or consumed by anyone. The exemption is not applicable to reconstructed, rebuilt, or repaired or previously owned machinery or equipment. The exemption is applicable to new machinery and equipment designed or installed for rental as well as for sale. The gross receipts from design or installation must be separately identified, char ged separately , and reasonable in amount for the exemption to apply . A \"computer\" is not considered to be machinery or equipment, and its installation or design is not eligible for this exemption. 18.58 (9) Pr operty used in r ecycling or r epr ocessing of waste pr oducts. Gross receipts from the sale or rental of machinery (including vehicles subject to registration), equipment, or computers directly and Ch 18, p. 68 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 primarily used in the recycling or reprocessing of waste products are exempt from tax. \"Reprocessing\" is not a subcategory of \"processing.\" Reprocessing of waste products is an activity separate and independent from the processing of tangible personal property . Machinery or equipment used in the recycling or reprocessing of waste products includes, but is not limited to, compactors, balers, crushers, grinders, cutters, or shears directly and primarily used for this purpose. The sale of an end loader , forklift, truck, or other moving device is exempt from tax if the device is directly and primarily used in the movement of property which is an integral part of recycling or reprocessing. The sale of a bin for storage ordinarily would not be exempt from tax; storage without more activity would not be a part of recycling or reprocessing. Certain limits for exemption placed upon industrial machinery and equipment are not applicable to machinery and equipment used in recycling or reprocessing. For example, the exemption will apply even if the machinery , equipment or computer is purchased by a person other than an insurance company , financial institution or commercial enterprise. A person engaged in a profession or occupation could purchase property for direct and primary use in recycling or reprocessing of waste products and the exemption would apply . a. By way of nonexclusive examples, recycling or reprocessing can begin when waste or material which would otherwise become waste is collected or separated. A vehicle used directly and primarily for collecting waste which will be recycled or reprocessed could be a vehicle used for an exempt purpose under this rule. Thus, the purchaser of a garbage truck could claim this exemption if the truck were directly and primarily used in recycling and not, for instance, in hauling garbage to a landfill. Machinery or equipment used to segregate waste from material to be recycled or reprocessed or used to separate various forms of materials which will be reprocessed (e.g., glass and aluminum) can also be used at the beginning of recycling or reprocessing. b. Machinery and equipment directly and primarily used in recycling or reprocessing. See subrule 18.58(1) for the definition of \"directly used\" which is applicable to this subrule. The examples of machinery not directly used in processing set out in 18.58(5) \"a\" should be studied for guidance in determining whether similar machinery is or is not used in recycling or reprocessing; e.g., machinery used in plant security (see 18.58(5) \"a\" (4) ) is not machinery directly used in recycling or reprocessing. c. Integral use in recycling or reprocessing. Ordinarily , any operation or series of operations which does not transform waste or material which would otherwise become waste into new raw materials or products would not be a part of recycling or reprocessing. However , activities which do not do this, but are an \"integral part\" of recycling or reprocessing, are themselves recycling or reprocessing. For example, an endless belt which moves aluminum cans from a machine where they are shredded to a machine where the shredded aluminum is crushed into blocks would be an endless belt used in recycling or reprocessing and the exemption applies. See subrule 18.29(5) for a discussion of when an activity is an integral part of \"processing.\" Some of that discussion is applicable to this subrule. d. The end of recycling or reprocessing. Recycling or reprocessing ends when waste or a material which would otherwise become waste is in the form of raw material or in the form of a product. For instance, a corporation purchases a machine which grinds logs, stumps, pallets, crates, and other waste wood into wood chips. After grinding, the wood chips are sold and transported to various sites where the chips are dumped and spread out over the ground for use in erosion control. The machine which grinds the wood chips is a machine used in recycling. The truck which transports the wood chips from the machine to the sites is not used in recycling because at the time the chips are placed in the truck they are in the form in which they will be used in erosion control. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code Supplement section 422.45(27) as amended by 1998 Iowa Acts, Senate File 2288 ; Iowa Code section 422.45(29) ; and Iowa Code chapter 423 . [ ARC 2349C , IAB 1/6/16, ef fective , IAB 10/12/16, ef fective at end chapter] 701\u201418. 59 (422,423) Exempt sales to nonpr ofit hospitals. On and after July 1, 1998, the gross receipts from sales or rentals of tangible personal property to and from the rendering, furnishing, or performing of services for a nonprofit hospital licensed under Iowa Code chapter 135B are exempt from tax if the property or service purchased is used in the operation of the hospital. A hospital is not entitled to claim IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 18, p. 69 a refund for tax paid by a contractor on the sale or use of tangible personal property or the performance of services in the fulfillment of a written construction contract with the hospital. However , see the circumstances set out below in which sales of goods, wares or merchandise, or taxable services to a hospital for use in the fulfillment of a construction contract, are exempt from Iowa tax. For the purposes of this rule, the word \"hospital\" means a place which is devoted primarily to the maintenance and operation of facilities for diagnosis, treatment, or care, over a period exceeding 24 hours, of two or more nonrelated individuals suf fering from illness, injury , or a medical condition (such as pregnancy). The word \"hospital\" includes general hospitals, specialized hospitals (e.g., pediatric, mental, and orthopedic hospitals, and cancer treatment centers), sanatoriums, and other hospitals licensed under Iowa Code chapter 135B . Also included are institutions, places, buildings, or agencies in which any accommodation is primarily maintained, furnished, or of fered for the care, over a period exceeding 24 hours, of two or more nonrelated aged or infirm persons requiring or receiving chronic or convalescent care. Excluded from the meaning of the term \"hospital\" are institutions for well children; day nursery and child care centers; foster boarding homes and houses; homes for handicapped children; homes, houses, or institutions for aged persons which limit their function to providing food, lodging, and provide no medical or nursing care, and house no bedridden person; dispensaries or first-aid stations maintained for the care of employees, students, customers, members of any commercial or industrial plan, educational institution, or convent; freestanding hospice facilities which operate a hospice program in accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7 418 and freestanding clinics which do not provide diagnosis, treatment, or care for periods exceeding 24 hours. This list of inclusions and exclusions is not exclusive. For additional information see 481\u2014Chapter 51 . Ordinarily , goods, wares, or merchandise (such as building materials, supplies, and equipment; see rule 701\u201419.3 (422,423) for definitions) which is purchased by a hospital and used by a contractor in the fulfillment of a written contract with the hospital cannot be purchased exempt from Iowa tax. The goods, wares, and merchandise used in the fulfillment of these construction contracts are not used in the \"operation\" of a hospital but in activities at least one step removed from that operation. See Polich v . Anderson-Robinson Coal Co., 227 Iowa 553, 288 N.W . 650 (1939). However , for a limited period, the gross receipts from all sales of goods, wares, or merchandise or from services rendered, furnished, or performed are exempt from tax (or a claim for refund may be filed for tax paid) if the tangible personal property or the taxable service is used in the fulfillment of a written construction contract with a hospital and all of the following circumstances exist: 1. Deliveries under contracts of sale of the goods, wares, or merchandise occurred or the taxable services were rendered, furnished, or performed between July 1, 1998, and December 31, 2001, inclusive. A claim for refund may be filed for any tax paid for this period, so long as the claim is filed prior to April 1, 2002, and the requirements of \"2\" and \"3\" below are also met. Claims for refunds of tax, interest, or penalty paid for the period of July 1, 1998, to December 31, 2001, are limited to $25,000 in the aggregate. If the amount of the claimed refunds for this period totals more than $25,000, the department must prorate the $25,000 among all claimants in relation to the amounts of the claimants' valid claims. 2. The written construction contract was entered into prior to December 31, 1999, or bonds to fund the construction were issued prior to December 31, 1999. 3. The property or services were purchased directly by the hospital or by a contractor as an agent of the hospital. For the purposes of this exemption, no hospital can retroactively designate a contractor to be its agent and by this means transform a contractor ' s purchases of goods, wares, merchandise, or services into its own. Upon the department' s request, a hospital claiming that a contractor is or has been its purchasing agent must present suitable evidence of a principal-agent relationship between itself and the contractor during any period for which exempt sales or a refund is claimed. The best evidence of a principal and purchasing agent relationship is a written document setting out the terms of the relationship and the period for which the agency is in ef fect; however , other evidence, which is the equivalent of a written document in reliability , will be considered by the department when necessary . This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code Supplement section 422.45 as amended by 2000 Iowa Acts, chapter 1207 .

Ef fective May 24, 1999, but retroactive to January 1, 1991, sales of ar gon and other similar gases to be used in the manufacturing process are exempt from tax. For the purposes of this rule, only inert gases are gases which are similar to ar gon. An \"inert gas\" is any gas which is normally chemically inactive. It will not support combustion and cannot be used as either a fuel or as an oxidizer . Ar gon, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, helium, neon, krypton, and xenon are nonexclusive examples of inert gases. Oxygen, hydrogen, and methane are nonexclusive examples of gases which are not inert. These sales are exempt only if the gas is purchased by a \"manufacturer ,\" for used in \"processing,\" as those terms are defined in subrule 18.45(1) , for the period prior to July 1, 1997, and as those terms are defined in subrule 18.58(1) for the period beginning July 1, 1997. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 422.45 as amended by 1999 Iowa Acts, chapter 170 . 701\u201418. 61 (422,423) Exclusion fr om tax for pr operty deliver ed by certain media. For the period beginning March 15, 1995, a taxable \"sale\" of tangible personal property does not occur if the substance of the transaction is delivered to the purchaser digitally , electronically , or by utilizing cable, radio waves, microwaves, satellites, or fiber optics. This exclusion from tax is not applicable to any leasing of tangible personal property , a lease not being a \"sale\" of tangible personal property for the purposes of Iowa sales and use tax law , Cedar V alley Leasing, Inc. v . Iowa Department of Revenue, 274 N.W .2d 357 (Iowa 1979). The exclusion is also not applicable to property delivered by any medium other than those listed above. Sales of items such as artwork, drawings, photographs, music, electronic greeting cards, \"canned\" software (see subrule 18.34(1) ), entertainment properties (e.g., films, concerts, books, and television and radio programs), and all other digitized products delivered as described above are not taxable, except the exclusion does not repeal by implication the tax on the service of providing pay television. See rule 701\u201426.56(422) . If an order for a product is placed by way of any of the media described above but the product ordered is delivered by conventional, physical means, e.g., the U.S. Postal Service or common carrier , sale of the product is not excluded from tax under this rule.

The Iowa state retail sales tax is imposed at the rate of 5 percent of the sales price from the sale at retail of tangible personal property and certain enumerated services. The rules in this chapter deal with certain specific attributes of the Iowa state retail sales tax, but such rules are by no means exclusive in explaining what are taxable sales and are not exclusive in explaining which transactions constitute taxable sales. There are other transactions which constitute taxable sales under the law and which are not specifically dealt with in these rules. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 423.2 . 701\u2014213. 2 (423) Athletic events. The sales price from the sale of tickets or admissions to athletic events occurring in the state of Iowa and sponsored by educational institutions, without regard to the use of the proceeds from such sales, shall be subject to tax, except when the events are sponsored by elementary and secondary educational institutions. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 423.2(3) . 701\u2014213. 3 (423) Conditional sales contracts. Iowa Code section 423.1(46) defines sales to include \"conditional sales.\" A conditional sale is a sale in which the vendee receives the right to the use of the goods which are the subject matter of the sale, but the transfer of title to the vendee is dependent on the performance of some condition by the vendee, usually the full payment of the purchase price. Conditional sales in most cases are evidenced by the facts supporting the nature of the vendor ' s business, the intent of the parties, and the facts supporting the control over the tangible personal property by the vendee. A conditional sales contract would exist where: the vendee/lessee has total control over the property and is responsible for all losses or damages; the transfer of the property is complete except for title, which passes upon the condition of full payment; and where such full payment is performed under nearly all the vendor ' s \"lease\" agreements, except in cases of default; and the vendor has no intent of retaining control over the property except for purposes of selling it or financing it for sale. In determining whether an agreement constitutes a conditional sale or a true lease, substance shall prevail over form, and the terminology of the written agreement will be considered only to the extent that it accurately represents the true relationship of the parties. When a conditional sale exists, the seller shall bill the purchaser for the full amount of tax due, and sales tax is due on the full contract price upon delivery of the property which is the subject of the contract. Har old D. Sturtz v . Iowa Department of Revenue , 373 N.W .2d 131 (Iowa 1985). No further tax is due on the periodic payments. Interest and finance char ges shall not be considered part of the sales price if they are separately stated and reasonable in amount and are, therefore, not subject to tax. State ex r el. T urner v . Y ounker Br os., Inc. , 210 N.W .2d 550, 562 (Iowa 1973). This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 423.1(46) and 423.2(1) . 701\u2014213. 4 (423) The sales price of sales of butane, pr opane and other like gases in cylinder drums, etc. Sales of butane, propane and other like gases in cylinder drums and other similar containers purchased for cooking, heating and other purposes shall be taxable. However , see rule 701\u2014231.16(423) , which provides for a phase-out of and eventual complete exemption from tax for propane and other gases sold for use in residential heating. When gas of this type is sold and motor vehicle fuel tax is collected by the seller , sales or use tax shall not be due. If Iowa motor vehicle fuel tax is not collected by the seller at the time of the sale, sales or use tax shall be collected and remitted to the department, unless the sale is specifically exempt. If tax is not collected by the seller at the time of sale, any tax due shall be collected by the department at the time the user of the product makes application for a refund of the motor vehicle fuel tax. Ch 213, p. 2 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 The sales price from the rental of cylinders, drums and other similar containers by the distributor or dealer of the gas shall be subject to tax when the title remains with the dealer . The sales price of gas converter equipment which might be sold to an ultimate consumer shall be subject to tax. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 423.1(46) and 423.2(1) . 701\u2014213. 5 (423) Antiques, curios, old coins, collector ' s postage stamps, and curr ency exchanged for gr eater than face value. Curios, antiques, art work, coins, collector ' s postage stamps and such articles sold to or by art collectors, philatelists, numismatists and other persons who purchase or sell such items of tangible personal property for use and not primarily for resale are sales at retail, and their sales price shall be subject to tax. 213.5 (1) The sales price of stamps, whether canceled or uncanceled, which are sold by a collector or person engaged in retailing stamps to collectors shall be taxable. 213.5 (2) The distinction between stamps which are purchased by a collector and stamps which are purchased for their value as evidence of the privilege of the owner to have certain mail carried by the United States government is that which determines whether or not the sales price of a stamp is taxable or not taxable. A stamp becomes an article of tangible personal property having market value when, because of the demand, it can be sold for a price greater than its face value. On the other hand, when a stamp has only face value, as evidence of the right to certain services or an indication that certain revenue has been paid, its sales price shall not be subject to either sales or use tax. 213.5 (3) The sales price from any exchange, transfer , or barter of merchandise for a consideration paid in gold, silver , or other coins or currency shall be subject to tax to the extent of the agreed-upon value of the coins or currency so exchanged. This agreed-upon value constitutes the sales price or purchase price subject to tax. Currency or coins become articles of tangible personal property having a value greater than face value when the currency or coins are exchanged for a price greater than face value. However , when a coin or other currency , in the course of circulation, is exchanged at its face value, the sales price of the sale shall be subject to tax for the face value alone. Losana Corp. v . Porterfield , 14 Ohio St.2d N.E.2d 535 (1968). E XAMPLE 1. T axpayer operates a furniture store. The taxpayer of fers to exchange furniture for silver coins at ten times the face value of any coins dated prior to January 1, 1965. Upon any exchange pursuant to the of fer , the value of the coins for purposes of determining the tax on the exchange will be equivalent to the value as agreed upon by the parties, without regard to the face value of the coins. E XAMPLE 2. T axpayer operates a hardware store. In the regular course of business, the taxpayer receives silver coins dated prior to January 1, 1965. T axpayer has received the coins at face value for the sales price and only that value is subject to tax.

As a common practice, hotels in the state of Iowa purchase telephone communication services from telephone companies and furnish those services to the guests of the hotel. The hotel makes a char ge for this communication service to its guests in an amount which exceeds the cost of such service to it from the telephone company . T ax shall apply to the entire char ge which the hotel makes to its guests for such communication service, regardless of whether a guest' s calls are local or long-distance within the state. However , the hotel would purchase any communication service which it furnishes for a char ge to a guest exempt from tax as a service purchased for subsequent resale. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 423.2(2) . 701\u2014213. 7 (423) Consignment sales. When a retailer receives tangible personal property on consignment from others and the consigned merchandise is sold in the ordinary course of business with other merchandise owned or services performed by the retailer , the retailer or consignee shall be making sales at retail. In these cases, the consignee shall file a return and remit tax to the department along with the returns and remittances of tax on the sales price from the sale of other merchandise. IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 213, p. 3 The sales price of sales of tangible personal property by an agent or consignee for another person shall be exempt if the sales meet the requirements of a casual sale or any other exemptions.

The sales price of electrotypes, types, zinc etchings, halftones, stereotypes, color process plates, wood mounts and art productions shall be subject to tax when sold to users or consumers.

A person engaged in the business of selling explosives to miners, quarries or others shall be subject to sales tax on the sales price from the sale of such property at retail in Iowa. The purchaser shall be liable for use tax upon all purchases for use in Iowa not subject to sales tax. Linwood Stone Pr oducts Company v . State Department of Revenue, Iowa , 175 N.W .2d 393 (1970). This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 423.2(1) and 423.5(1) . 701\u2014213. 10 (423) Sales on layaway . The sales price from sales on layaway is subject to tax. A layaway sale involves two separate and distinct contracts. Under the first contract, the customer and the retailer enter into an agreement to give the customer an option to purchase a certain item of tangible personal property . Under the second contract, the sale of property takes place. During the period of the option to purchase, the item is placed aside \"on layaway\" and is not available for sale to the general public. This option to purchase is exercised by the customer ' s making one or more \"layaway payments.\" The customer exercises the option to buy by completing the layaway payments. The last layaway payment is also the tendered payment under the separate contract for sale of the property . The contract for sale is complete when the seller delivers the property to the buyer . See Holland v . Br own , 15 Utah 2d 422, 394 P .2d 77 (1964) and Sturtz Iowa Department of Revenue , 373 N.W .2d 131 (Iowa 1985). T ax must be reported during the period (e.g., the quarter or month) in which delivery under the contract for sale portion of the layaway occurs. This will nearly always be the reporting period in which physical transfer of possession passes from the retailer to the buyer . A sale on layaway should not be confused with a \"conditional sale.\" The dif ferences are these: (1) In a conditional sale, physical transfer of property occurs before, rather than after , the buyer makes all periodic payments necessary to purchase the property; and (2) in a conditional sale, physical possession of and title to the property pass to the buyer at dif ferent times. In a conditional sales situation, physical possession passes first; then after all periodic payments are made, title (ownership) passes to the buyer . In a layaway sale, both possession and title pass at the same time after all payments are made. The conditional sale is a much more common commercial arrangement than the sale on layaway . This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 423.1(46) and 423.2(1) . 701\u2014213. 1 1 (423) Memorial stones. Persons engaged in the business of selling memorial stones are selling tangible personal property , the sales price of which shall be subject to tax. When the seller of a memorial stone agrees to erect a stone upon a foundation, the total sales price from such sale shall be taxable. Any separately itemized char ge for engraving is part of the taxable sales price of a memorial stone. The sales price of any designs, lettering or engraving performed on a memorial stone or monument is also subject to tax. See In Re Des Moines-W interset Monuments, Inc. , Docket No. 79-228-6A-DR, March 13, 1980. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 423.2(1) .

Pursuant to the provisions of any piece of chattel paper or any other document evidencing a creditor ' s interest in tangible personal property , the sales price from the sale of tangible personal property at a public auction shall be taxable even if the sale is made by virtue of a court decree of foreclosure by an of ficer appointed by the court for that purpose. The tax applies to the sales price of inventory and noninventory goods, provided the owner is in the business of making retail sales of tangible personal property or taxable services.

A retailer selling pets shall procure a permit and report tax on the sales price from the sale of such pets. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 423.1(54) and 423.2(1) . 701\u2014213. 14 (423) Redemption of meal tickets, coupon books and mer chandise cards as a taxable sale. When meal tickets, coupon books, or merchandise cards are sold by persons engaged exclusively in selling taxable commodities or services, tax shall be levied at the time such items are redeemed by the customer . T ax shall not be added at the time of actual purchase of the meal ticket, coupon book, or merchandise card. When a retailer sells gift certificates, tax shall be added at the time the gift certificate is redeemed. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 423.1 and 423.2 . 701\u2014213. 15 (423) Rental of personal pr operty in connection with the operation of amusements. The sales price from rental of tangible personal property in connection with the operation of amusements shall be taxable. Such rentals shall include all tangible personal property or equipment used by patrons in connection with the operation of commercial amusements, notwithstanding the fact that the rental of such personal property may be billed separately . This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 423.2(1) . 701\u2014213. 16 (423) Repossessed goods. When tangible personal property which has been repossessed either by the original seller or by a finance company is resold to final users or consumers, the sales price from those sales is subject to tax. A retailer repossessing previously sold merchandise shall be entitled to claim a credit on tax paid for bad debts in the same fashion as any other retailer that has paid tax to the department upon a sales price which ultimately constitutes a bad debt. Reference rule 701\u201415.4(422,423) for a description of the circumstances under which bad debts are and are not allowed as a credit on tax paid. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 423.2(1) and 423.5(1) . 701\u2014213. 17 (423) Sales of signs at r etail. A person engaged in selling illuminated signs, bulletins, or other stationary signs (whether manufactured by that person or by others) to users or consumers is selling tangible personal property at retail. The sales price shall be taxable, even when the sales price of the sign includes a char ge for maintenance or repair service in addition to the char ge for the sign. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 423.2(1) and 423.5(1) . 701\u2014213. 18 (423) T angible personal pr operty made to order . When a retailer contracts to fabricate items of tangible personal property from materials available in stock or through placing orders for materials which have been selected by customers, all expenses and profits from the sale of such fabricated articles shall be included in the sales price. The retailer shall not deduct fabrication or production char ges, even though such char ges are separately billed. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 423.2(1) and 423.5(1) . 701\u2014213. 19 (423) Used or secondhand tangible personal pr operty . The sales price on the sale of used or secondhand tangible personal property in the form of goods, wares, or merchandise shall be IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 213, p. 5 taxable in the same manner as new property . This condition eliminates any consideration for secondhand merchandise to be treated dif ferently than new merchandise when sold at retail for sales tax purposes. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 423.2(1) and 423.5(1) . 701\u2014213. 20 (423) Carpeting and other floor coverings. The sale of carpeting and other floor coverings to any person constitutes a sale at retail of tangible personal property , and the sales price of these sales is subject to sales or use tax unless the carpeting and other floor coverings are purchased for resale or are otherwise exempt from tax. The sales price of floor coverings other than carpeting which are shaped to fit a particular room or area and which are attached to the supporting floor with cement, tacks, or by some other method making a permanent attachment with the building or structure are considered to be building materials and shall be taxable in the same manner as building materials which are used or consumed in the performance of a construction contract. See rule 701\u2014219.2(423) and 701\u2014subrule 219.3(3) for tax treatment. The sale of carpeting is not to be treated as the sale of a \"building material.\" The sales price of rugs, mats, linoleum, and other types of floor coverings which are not attached but which are simply laid on finished floors and are not considered building materials is subject to tax unless the floor coverings are purchased for resale or are otherwise exempt from tax. The sale of \"carpeting\" to owners, contractors, subcontractors or builders is not the sale of a building material, but the sale of ordinary tangible personal property , which can be purchased for resale by owners, contractors, subcontractors or builders. \"Carpeting\" is any floor covering made of fabric, usually of wool or synthetic fibers. For purposes of this rule, \"carpeting\" also includes any pads, tack strips, adhesive, and other materials other than subflooring necessary for installation of the carpeting. Sellers of carpeting should char ge purchasers sales tax unless the carpeting is purchased for resale or some other exempt purpose, in which case the purchaser must provide the seller with an exemption certificate upon demand. The sales price of carpeting, with installation, is taxable in the following manner: 1. If separate contracts exist for the sale of the carpeting and for the installation, only the sales price of the carpeting is subject to tax. 2. If the selling price of the carpeting and the installation char ge are stated as one char ge or lump sum, the entire char ge is subject to sales tax. 3. If the invoice itemizes the installation char ge separately from the selling price of the carpet, only the selling price of the carpet is subject to sales tax if the installer and the purchaser of the carpet intend that a sale of the carpet shall occur . See 701\u2014subrule 225.4(1) for more information. In the following examples, assume that contractor A purchases carpeting from supplier B for installation in customer C' s home. Whether or not A will purchase the carpeting from B for A ' s own consumption (and thus, A will pay the tax to B) or A will purchase the property from B for resale to C (and thus, C will pay the tax to A) depends upon any contracts existing between A (the contractor) and C (the customer). E XAMPLE A. A contracts with C to install carpeting in C' s home. Separate contracts exist between A and C for the sale of the carpeting and for its installation. Under these circumstances, A purchases the carpeting from B for resale to C. No tax is due upon the sales price of the transaction between A and B; tax is due upon A ' s resale of the carpet to C, but not upon A ' s char ges for carpet installation, a nontaxable service. E XAMPLE B. A char ges C one lump sum for the carpeting and installation. In this case, A collects sales tax from C on the entire lump sum. The lump sum is treated, for sales tax purposes, as the sales price from the sale of tangible personal property; so A purchases the carpet from B for resale and without tax. E XAMPLE C. A and C contract for the sale of the carpet separate from its installation. A sends C one invoice for the installation and sale of the carpet with the installation char ge listed on the invoice separately from the selling price of the carpet. Under these circumstances, only the selling price of the carpet listed on the invoice is subject to sales tax and A purchases the carpet from B for resale and thus, without obligation to pay sales tax to B. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 423.2(1) \"b.\" Ch 213, p. 6 Revenue[701] IAC 10/7/20 701\u2014213. 21 (423) Goods damaged in transit. If goods shipped by a retailer have been delivered under a contract for sale to a consumer , and thereafter the goods are damaged in the course of transit to the consumer , the retailer and purchaser shall be liable for tax upon the full sale price of the goods, as the sale to the consumer has been completed. Har old D. Sturtz v . Iowa Department of Revenue , 373 N.W .2d 131 (Iowa 1985). If the goods have not been delivered to the consumer , the sale to the consumer has not been completed, and the retailer shall not be taxed for the amount agreed to be paid by the consumer . E XAMPLE . A company in Chicago transports furniture in its own truck to customer B in Des Moines. Under the contract of sale, delivery of the furniture would occur in Des Moines and sales tax would ordinarily be due upon the sales price of the sale. However , in East Moline, Illinois, the furniture truck is involved in an accident, and B' s furniture is destroyed. There was no delivery of the furniture to B, thus no sale to B and thus no sales tax is due. Had the point of delivery been Chicago, Illinois, a sale would have occurred outside this state, but no use tax would be due because B never made any \"use\" of the furniture in Iowa. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 423.2 . 701\u2014213. 22 (423) Snowmobiles, motorboats, and certain other vehicles. The sales price of snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, dirt bikes, race karts or go-carts, and motorboats shall be subject to tax when purchased and shall not be classified as vehicles subject to registration. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code chapter 423 . 701\u2014213. 23 (423) Photographers and photostaters. T ax shall apply to the sales price of photographs and photostat copies, whether or not produced to the special order of the customer , and to char ges for the making of photographs or photostat copies out of materials furnished by the customer . A deduction shall not be allowed for the expenses incurred by the photographer , such as rental of equipment or salaries or wages paid to assistants or models, whether or not the expenses are itemized in billings to customers. T ax shall not apply to the sales price of tangible personal property to photographers and photostat producers which becomes an ingredient or component part of photographs or photostat copies sold, such as mounts, frames and sensitized paper; but tax shall apply to the sales price of materials to photographers or producers which is used in the processing of photographs or photostat copies. The sales price of photographs by a person engaged in the business of making and selling photographs to newspaper or magazine publishers for reproduction shall be taxable. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 423.2 and 423.5 . 701\u2014213. 24 (423) Sale, transfer or exchange of tangible personal pr operty or taxable enumerated services between affiliated corporations. The sales price of the sale, transfer or exchange of tangible personal property or taxable services among af filiated corporations, including but not limited to a parent corporation to a subsidiary corporation, for a consideration is subject to tax. A bookkeeping entry for an \"account payable\" qualifies as consideration as well as the actual exchange of money or its equivalent. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 423.1(50) . [ 1/20] 701\u2014213. 25 (423) Urban transit systems. A privately owned urban transit system which is not an instrumentality of federal, state or county government is subject to sales tax on fuel purchases which are within the urban transit system' s charter . T ax shall not apply to the sales price of fuel purchases made by a privately owned urban transit company for use outside the urban transit system charter in which a fuel tax has been imposed and paid and no refund has been or will be allowed. Whether an urban transit company will be considered an instrumentality of federal, state or county government for the purpose of receiving sales tax exemption on its fuel purchases, which are also exempted from fuel tax and used for public purposes, depends upon consideration of the following: 1. Whether the urban transit system is created by government. 2. Whether the urban transit system is wholly owned by government. IAC 10/7/20 Revenue[701] Ch 213, p. 7 3. Whether the urban transit system is operated for profit. 4. Whether the urban transit system is primarily engaged in the performance of some essential governmental function. 5. Whether the payment of tax will impose an economic burden upon the corporation, or whether payment of tax serves to materially impair the usefulness or ef ficiency of the corporation or the payment of tax materially restricts the corporation in the performance of its duties. The considerations enumerated above are not all-inclusive, and the presence of some considerations and absence of others does not necessarily establish the exemption.
