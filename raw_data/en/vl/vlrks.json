Lavender plants are believed to originate from the Mediterranean, Middle East, and India. Indeed the history of humans using lavender for healing can be traced back over 2500 years. Lavender derives its name from the Latin 'lavare' meaning 'to wash'. The Romans used the beautiful blue-violet Lavender flowers in their baths to relieve fatigue and stiff joints, and in their beds and clothes to keep the bugs away. They even used Lavender to scent their hair. Medieval Europeans considered Lavender to be an emblem of love. Lavender is a true adaptogen, and a universally healing herb. As an adaptogen, lavender goes into your system and works where it is needed to help your mind, body, and/or spirit find balance. Lavender's aroma is simultaneously stimulating and relaxing. There's nothing quite like the refreshing green, herbal, floral --- other-worldly scent of Lavender to help you relax into sublime peace. Lavender Is Clearing + Cleansing for the Mind, Body + Spirit. Lavender can be used by itself or in combination with other herbs such as white sage, sweetgrass or [palo santo](https://angel-face-2.myshopify.com/collections/body/products/palo-santo-quartz-spiritual-ritual-cleansing-oil-organic-and-vegan-aromatherapy-potion) as a smudge to cleanse your environment of negativity, and neutralize any stale, lingering bad vibes. Mindfully infusing your space with Lavender sets the intention for a peaceful, grounded energy before making art, studying, working, practicing yoga, meditation, saying prayers or affirmations, chanting mantras, pulling tarot or oracle cards, gathering in circle, and engaging in any type of sacred ceremony. So why not mist a little Lavender into your midst with our [Lavender LOVE Alchemy Mist](https://spagoddess.com/collections/face/products/lavender-love-balancing-alchemy-mist), infused with Amethyst crystals and balancing flower essences. Give the bottle a gentle shake to activate the botanical alchemy, then mist your your skin, your environment, take a long, slow deep breath and feel your aura bathed in the violet ray of healing. Lavender soothes and calms the skin, reduces redness, balances oil production, heals blemishes, and stimulates circulation for improved skin tone. Lavender aids depression, insomnia, mood swings, and stress. It clears your thinking, reduces worry, and balances emotions. It's been known to help a headache, ease muscular pain, relieve respiratory ailments, speed healing of cuts, scrapes, and bruises, as well as soothe a sunburn or a bug bite. Lavender nurtures creativity and self-expression. Lavender essential oil is the universal healing oil for the seven major chakras, helping bring them into balance. Lavender is associated with the third-eye chakra whose attributes include intuition, imagination, visualization, and concentration. For the Lavender Connoisseur! I like to think of blending Lavenders similar to how vintners making a cuvee of wine--playing with nuances, blending, accenting, and balancing the scents into something so much richer than the sum of each part. Different varietals grown in different climates and soils have different scents along with varied therapeutic healing profiles. Some are sweet and soft with notes of honey, some are decidedly floral, others quite herbaceous, sharp, and even woodsy. Sometimes they are heavily camphoraceous and then some have surprising fruity notes. In the cosmetic industry, there are also standardized essential oils such as Lavender 40/42 where the aroma chemicals are altered and recombined to create a uniform and easily replicated scent. Lavender 40/42 is blended to produce an oil containing 40% linalool and 42% linalyl acetate, which are the two primary aroma compounds occurring in Lavender. You might be surprised to know that essential oils are comprised of chemicals - they are!! These chemical constituents are natural but can also be isolated and recreated in a lab. Is this type of standardization natural? That's a gray area in my opinion and as a naturalist, I find this kind of adulteration undesirable. We do not use any isolates or standardized essential oils because we believe that the whole plant contains the entire spectrum of synergistic healing properties. The one exception is that we use a bergamot essential oil which has had the bergepten removed because that phyto-chemical is phototoxic.
