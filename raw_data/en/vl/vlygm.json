M.S. Metabolic & Nutriti onal Medicine Concentration M.S. in Medical Sciences: Metabolic & Nutritional Medicine Concentration Concentration Description: Considered the vanguard of the new millennium in which science truly complements the art of medicine, integration of the traditional \"basic science\" and \"clinical science\" disciplines that form the foun dation of the traditional medical curriculum has been the objective in training c linicians who strive to understa nd the molecular and physiological bases of disease and the aging process with the objective of developing and implementing new approaches to retard and potential ly reverse the aging process in patients using new therapies and preventative measures such as nutritional in tervention and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Recent changes in the focus of research and schola rship in the biomedical sciences has directed attention to the development and training of clinicians in \"translational medicine\" who are able to cross the barriers of traditional disciplines and embrace the concepts of interdisciplinary approaches to treating the aging process and a ssociated diseases. The new concentration in Metabolic & Nutritional Medicine (MNM), within the Master's Program in Medical Sciences in the College of Medicine, has been develope d to provide a novel interdisciplinary and concentrated program of study that is designed for practicing clinicians and other experienced health-care professionals who are committed to developing their theoretical and practical expertise in this rapidly evol ving field of medical care and w ho value the interdisciplinary approach to the medical sciences. Metabolic Medicine can be defi ned as a group of overlapping ar eas of clinical practice with common dependence on a detailed understanding of basic biochemi stry and metabolism together with other cellular processes. It therefore falls within the areas of expertise of many of the clinical disciplines that emphasize nutritional diso rders, inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) and pathophysiological changes. Exam ples of these areas include disorders of nutrition, IEM, disorders of lipid metabolism and CV risk asse ssment, disorders of cal cium metabolism and bone and diabetes and decreases in cognitive skills. The Metabolic & Nutritional Medicine program fo cuses on the application of the principles of metabolic and nutritional medicine to the aging process in humans, but has applications to all stages of development. Studies have indicated th at the aging process cannot be conceptualized by probing a solitary gene or individual metabolic pathways, but should best be addressed at the systems level. Biological examples of aging include not only the sum total of shortened telomeres, the array of denatured proteins and m odified DNA molecules but also examples of the oxidative damage to mitochond ria and programmed cell death or apoptosis. In addition, the aging process also results in alterations in key regulatory nodes critical for maintaining the integrity of the organism. A dynami c progression, aging increases im balances in the organism as a result of degenerati ng biological processes. A regenerative medicine approach to clinical care provides an integrative methodology to optimize the body's endoge nous mechanisms of self-repair together with the inclusion of proven e xogenous treatments and technologies that have been demonstrated to retard th e aging process. This novel graduate M.S. M.S. Metabolic & Nutriti onal Medicine Concentration concentration focuses on the functional and re generative medicine components of the major disciplines that comprise the \"basic and clinical sciences\" in traditional medical school curricula and includes courses that in tegrate endocrinology, cardiovasc ular disease, intermediary metabolism, genetics, immunology, pharmacology, nut rition, physiology and biomedical ethics with biomedical aging. These clinically-oriente d subject areas have been combined to provide both a solid foundation and include the most recent advances in metabolic and nutritional medicine. The rigorous program is designed to en able participants to expand and enhance their medical skills for the future clinical pr actice of metabolic and nutritional medicine. The main objectives of the Metabolic and Nutritional Medicine curriculum are to: \u0099 Provide advanced scientific and clinical training for several areas of medicine which require greater knowle dge than delivered in most organ-based specialties. For example, these include the subject area of biochemistry and molecular biology, genetics, endocrinolog y, cardiovascular physiology, immunology, cancer and nutrition. \u0099 Further develop the clinical training of physicians and other health-care practitioners who wish to include metabo lic and nutritional medicine in their current practices. \u0099 Support the academic progress and devel opment of Metabolic and Nutritional Medicine as an advanced specialization. The interdisciplinary nature of the concentration promotes a broad intellectual focus that is required of current and future pr ofessional and graduate students in the clinical sciences. A novel feature of the program is that all course mate rials are delivered using a concentrated lecture format combined with extensive \"web casts\" and relevant practical experience that encourages active participation by all stude nts enrolled in the program. Relationship to the USF Strategic Plan: The proposed Master's concentration in Metabolic & Nutritional Medicine will contribute to the University's strategic plan in th e following goals and strategies: Goal 1 Expanding world-class interdisciplinary res earch, creative and scholarly endeavors. Promote nationally and internationally distinctive and prominent research and graduate programs. The Metabolic & Nutritional Medicine Master's concentration represents a new, integrated graduate program that primarily focuses on the translational aspects of the basic and clinical sciences components of the trad itional medical curriculum and expands access to courses and material that are normally only available to stud ents enrolled in professional medical programs or previous graduates of prof essional medical programs. In addition, the combination of the \"concentrated\" course format together with extensive webcasts and practical experience represents a new approach to delivering courses of this type in the State of Florida. Goal II Promoting globally competitive undergraduate, graduate and professional programs that support interdisciplinary i nquiry, intellectual developm ent, knowledge and skill acquisition, and student success through a div erse, fully- engaged, & Nutriti onal Medicine Concentration Create and support globally competitive, re levant and distinctive academic programs that address the changing needs of the region, state and na tion through innovative approaches to curriculum development and delivery, Provide increased access to excellence in higher education for students who demonstrate the aptitude to succeed, Enhance and expand the talent pool by shaping the enrollment profile of USF's graduate student body to refl ect that found at a pre-emin ent research university. The Metabolic & Nutritional Medicine Master's concentration represents a new and distinctive academic concentration by virtue of its componen t courses and their associated content. The innovative curriculum and method of instructional delivery will address the region's and state's need for more clinicians and hea lth-care professionals that are tr ained in regenerative, metabolic and nutritional medicine. The inclusion of m odern distance education technologies will significantly expand access to these courses by students who substantially exceed the minimum entry qualifications for USF's gr aduate programs and are unable to register for the College's traditional courses owing to geographical or car eer scheduling limitations. In addition, students who successfully complete the program will have demonstrated substantial academic ability and will be well-prepared to continue their educ ation in USF's translational doctoral program, resulting in an expanded applicant pool. Program (Major): M.S. in Medical Sciences Requirements: The proposed curriculum is attached a nd features a combination of a clinical intensive core course, eight required courses and a selection of several electives (five), that can be completed in approximately two years. For admission, students must meet the minimum qualifications of the Graduate School. In addi tion, program applicants must possess either a M.D. degree or a Ph.D. degree or their equivalent in the heal th sciences from a regionally accredited institution. The majority of students t ypically applying to this type of program significantly exceed these minimums.
