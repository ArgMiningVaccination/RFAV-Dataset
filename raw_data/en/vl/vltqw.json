This will include a review of current statistics and the reasons why true prevalence of fatal maltreatment is probably underestimated. The differences between fatal maltreatment and typical homicides will be discussed. The most common type of fatal child abuse and fatal neglect cases will be illustrated using case examples. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome will be discussed. Lunch Break Continuation of Overview of Fatal Child Abuse and Neglect Investigation of Fatal Child Abuse and Neglect This module will provide the students with information on the investigation of fatal child abuse and neglect. This will include information on the initial response as well as the subsequent interviews of witnesses and medical professionals. The importance of report writing and courtroom testimony will be discussed. Actual case examples will be used to demonstrate the learning objectives. 12:00 noon - 1:00 p.m. Lunch Break Day Two (continued) 1:00 p.m. - 2:00 p.m. 2:00 p.m. - 2:15 p.m. 2:15 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. Day Three 8:00 a.m. - 10:00 a.m. 10:00 a.m. -10:15 a.m. 10:15 a.m. -12:00 noon Continuation of Investigation of Fatal Child Abuse and Neglect Break Crime Scene and Forensic Evidence This module will demonstrate the forensic evidence found at the crime scene, at the death location, and the vehicles used to transport the child. The evidence value will be demonstrated to help solve the cases. The Role of CPS in Child Fatality and Homicide Investigations This module will provide discussion on the role of Child Protective Services in the investigation of child fatality and homicide investigations and demonstrate the importance of conducting joint investigations between law enforcement and social work. This module will also illustrate the necessity for open communication and dialog between all agencies involved in a multi-disciplinary approach to the service provision and prosecution of such cases. Break Conducting Interviews and Interrogations in Child Fatality Cases This module will discuss investigative techniques and strategies necessary for building a solid criminal case against the perpretrator. The instructor will provide the students with an overview and understanding of the problems and dynamics encountered by investigators in child fatality investigations. Topics to be covered include: Miranda vs. non-Miranda issues, custodial vs. non-custodial interviews, methology of detailed fact gathering to which helps establish care, custody and control issues, taped interviews vs. non- taped interviews, themes of interviews to pursue, documenting inconsistences, and recognizing clinical indicators during the interview. 12:00 noon - 1:00 p.m. Lunch Break Day Three (continued) 1:00 p.m. - 2:00 p.m. 2:00 p.m. - 2:15 p.m. 2:15 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. Day Four Continuation of Conducting Interviews and Interrogations in Child Fatality Cases Break Medical Aspects of Child Fatality Investigations The instructor will describe the basic anatomy of the various organ systems, the bio-mechanical nature of injuries to these organs, and the approach to distinguishing between accidental and inflicted injuries. By looking at the medical reasons for child deaths, the instructor will describe the approach to recognizing and diagnosing child fatalities. The instructor will explain the significance of the findings at autopsy of child victims of abuse and neglect. 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 noon 12:00 noon - 1:00 p.m. 1:00 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. Day Five 8:00 a.m.- 10:00 a.m. 10:00 a.m.- 10:15 a.m. Continuation of Medical Aspects of Child Fatality Investigations Lunch Break Prosecution of Child Fatalities The instructor will present issues (common and not so commom) arising from the investigation and prosecution of fatal child abuse and neglect cases.

Fatal Child Abuse vs. Homicide * Prosecution depends heavily on medical evidence -confusing, technical testimony for jury -testimony and opinions of several medical specialists -may be decided by \"battle of the medical experts\" Fatal Child Abuse vs. Homicide Prosecution depends on proving a circumstantial evidence case - only the defendant could have committed the fatal abuse - guilt must be \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" -Defense only has to convince there is another explanation or another responsible party Fatal Child Abuse vs. Homicide Victim may not have visible external injuries -death may appear natural -autopsy may not be conducted -delay in investigation starting Fatal Child Abuse vs. Homicide Investigation complicated by CPS involvement -requires coordination and communication between police and CPS -different agency missions and goals -different decision making processes Fatal Child Abuse vs. Homicide * Investigation may be conducted by someone unfamiliar with dynamics of child abuse and death investigation . Deceased child may be moved from the location Battered Child Syndrome * Repeated acts of intentional trauma inflicted on young children that are clearly identifiable as non-accidental . Child tends to have injuries about the head, commonly it is the cause of death Battered Child Syndrome * Child may have concurrent evidence of neglect, mainourishment, old injuries * Battered Child Syndrome evidence is admissible in court - Estelle v. Mc Guire, 1991, 112 US 475 Battered Child Syndrome * May delay seeking medical attention * Caretakers' explanation for injuries is vague, and/or inconsistent * Caretakers may blame injury on child's clumsiness, other siblings, accident Battered Child Syndrome Caretakers' history provided to medical staff is not consistent with clinical findings Child may or may not be a singled out or \"targeted\" for abuse Impulse or Anger Homicides * Sudden, impulsive act of violent assault resulting in fatal injuries to the child -shaking -punching and/or kicking -striking with an object -throwing Impulse or Anger Homicides Aside from fatal injuries, child may appear relatively well cared for and normal May be a delay in seeking medical attention Caretakers' history provided to medical staff is not consistent with clinical findings Impulse or Anger Homicides Important to \"'lock\" caretakers into their story early in the investigation Important that caretakers not be alerted to the implausibility of their story Impulse or Anger Homicides Impulse murders may be more common than Battered Child cases Offenders very likely to confess if handled properly Shaken Baby Syndrome SBS results from severe, repetitive shaking Injury may occur w/o impact to the skull Crying is often cited as the \"trigger event\" Shaken Baby Syndrome Major injury is to child's brain from violent shaking Rapid angular acceleration- deceleration forces Child usually held by upper arms or chest facing caretaker Shaken Baby Syndrome Force needed is severe, requires upper body strength Fatal in @ 25 % of the cases Observer would know that the forces involved were severe and life threatening Shaken Baby Syndrome Medical findings include: - Bilateral retinal hemorrhages (90% of time) - Subdural or Subarachnoid hemorrhages - Cerebral edema (brain swelling) - Shearing of nerve fibers in brain white matter (Diffuse axonal injury) - \"Black Brain\" on MR] or CT scan - bruises and other external signs of abuse - Skull fracture Shaken Baby Syndrome After the assault, there is almost always an immediate change in the child's condition, symptoms include; - loss of alertness and/or consciousness - inability or unwillingness to eat, vomiting - irritability, unresponsiveness, lethargy - breathing difficulties -coma and/or seizures - death Abusive Head Trauma * Craniocerebral trauma (head) is the most common cause of death in physically abused children - second only to MV related injuries as a cause of death in children Abusive Head Trauma * Injuries may not be externally visible * Child may present clinically with: -vomiting, inability or unwillingness to eat -drowsiness, irritability - respiratory problems -coma, shock, seizure Abusive Head Trauma *There is no specific diagnostic pattern of inflicted head trauma. .Diagnosis is based on the history and the clinical findings Abusive Head Trauma * Children's unique anatomy makes them especially vulnerable : - relatively large head & brain with high water content - more space between brain and skull - child's weight - undeveloped neck muscles Head Injuries A child that has \"raccoon eyes\" may actually have a head injury at the base of the skull. \"Red Flag\" Stories from Caretakers * Child was unexpectedly found dead, but not consistent with SIDS * Child suddenly turned blue, stopped breathing Child suffered a sudden seizure event Child was hurt by improper CPR Child hurt themselves, or hurt by sibling \"Red Flag\" Stories from Caretakers Child was killed falling down stairs Child fell from a low height (< 4 ft.) Child was hit on head by a fallen object Child was choking so caretaker shook/hit the child on the back Fatal Falls * Dr. Chadwick's trauma center study - 317 children <5 yrs. ~> 7 deaths in 100 children involving falls < 4 ft. ~> 1 death in 118 children involving falls 10-45 ft.

Fatal Falls Dr. Chadwick's second trauma center study -523 children studied >>inflicted injuries were excluded >>188 children fell > 10 ft. >>longest fall was 40 ft. >>no children died Fatal Falls Falls < 20 ft. are usually not fatal Falls < 4 ft. are very unlikely to cause brain & CNS injury Stairways falls do not usually result in life threatening injuries - similar to a series of small falls, unless a child is in a walker The contact surface does make a difference - carpet, wood, concrete, hard object Chest Injuries Majority of children with rib fractures are < 2 yrs. old. Rib fractures are the most common type of abusive fractures in children Posterior (back) rib fractures are the most commonly found It is very unlikely that improper CPR is the cause of rib fractures in children Internal Injuries High mortality rates due to delayed medical treatment resulting from: -delay in presentation of child -inaccurate or false history provided by caretaker -inability of child to give information -injuries may not be externally visible Children's Anatomy Smaller blood volumes - hemorrhages are worse Internal organs are close to one another - a single impact may injure > one organ Abdominal wall covered by undeveloped muscles and little fat The chest has flexible ribs that allows greater compressibility Internal Injuries Caused by: -direct impacts >) punching >> kicking >> stomping -indirect shearing forces >> rapid deceleration of the body .child thrown into the wall Internal Injuries Second leading cause of fatal injuries 40-50 % mortality rate May not be externally visible Liver is the most commonly injured solid organ due to abuse Kidney is the second most commonly injured solid organ due to abuse Internal Injuries Hollow visceral organs can rupture due to compression - stomach, intestine Intestinal injuries are common abusive injuries - especially small intestine Small bowel injuries are difficult to diagnose, thus significant morbidity and mortality, rates Internal Injuries * Clinical picture -vomiting (often bilious) - dehydration may occur - abdominal pain - distended stomach - coma, shock - peritonitis - delayed onset of symptoms -(1 hr. to 1 day) Fractures Fractures suggestive of abuse: - multiple fractures - fractures of different ages - fractures that lack plausible history or explanation Fractures commonly due to accidents: - clavicle - shafts of the long bones - linear skull fractures (except in infants) Neglect Most prevalent form of child maltreatment reported Neglect is the caretaker's failure to meet the child's needs in terms of food, shelter, medical care or safekeeping Neglect is involved in @ 1/2 of fatal incidents Neglect .Neglect is a continuum of care Very.

POLICY The Child Services Unit of the Falrfax County Police Department is established as the entity with primary responsibility for investigative coordination with the Department of Family Services in instances of the physical and/or sexual abuse of children. Whenever necessary, the Child Services Unit will be augmented by other sections of the Major Crimes Division. The Child Services Unit will work closely with the Department of Family Services in cases involving caretaker relationships. The goals of this protocol shall be supported by the following procedures: An initial review of allegations will be made by the Department of Family Services to obtain an overview of the nature of the violation, such as: proper jurisdiction, time frame of event, information on the victim and alleged abuser. The Department of Family Services shall be contacted immediately in cases where DFS has jurisdiction when the cases first come to police attention. DFS shall contact the Child Services Unit Supervisor, or in his absence, a CIB Major Crimes Supervisor in case's involving serious injury, death, or sexual crimes involving recent penetration. An investigator will be assigned for immediate investigation. Cases of sexual abuse shall be referred by the DFS worker to the Child Services Unit Supervisor. Appropriate cases will be assigned to an investigator for a joint investigation. Cases involving physical abuse shall be evaluated by a DFS Supervisor prior to contacting CIB, ffa case appears to be prosecutable, contact will then be made with the Child Services Unit Supervisor for review and assignment. Decisions to offer polygraph examinations to suspects and victims will rest with the Child Services Unit Supervisor and the Police Polygraph Section. The Child Services Unit investigator will be responsible for controlling and coordinating cases of abuse which are likely to culminate in criminal prosecution. i The Office of the Commonwealth's Attorney will remain the final decision-making authority when determining if a case will be prosecuted criminally. Whenever possible, interviews of victims and suspects will be conducted jointly in a team approach by the Child Services Unit and DFS. DFS and Police representatives will attend regular meetings to discuss ongoing cases, training, and other issues of concern. Sufficient notice will be provided to the Child Services investigator by the DFS worker on civil petitions, as well as the name of the County Attorney assigned to the case. This will allow the investigator to liaison with the County Attorney and review evidence pertinent to the petition, as well as protect evidence which may be needed in a later criminal trial. Colonel ~M. Douglas Scott Chief of Police Fairfax County Police Department (Date) aR., 0 Cocie of Ethics Page 1 of 18 National Association of Social Workers CODE OF ETHICS Effective January 1, 1997 Preamble The primary mission of the social work profession is to enhance human well being and help meet the basic human needs of all people, with particular attention to the needs and empowerrnent of people who are vulnerable, oppressed, and living in poverty. A historic and defining feature of social work is the profession's focus on individual well being in a social context and the well being of society. Fundamental to social work is attention to the environmental forces that create, contribute to, and address problems in living. Social workers promote social justice and social change with and on behalf of clients. \"Clients\" is used inclusively to refer to individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. Social workers are sensitive to cultural and ethnic diversity and strive to end discrimination, oppression, poverty, and other forms of social injustice. These activities may be in the form of direct practice, community organizing, supervision, consultation, administration, advocacy, social and political action, policy development and implementation, education, and research and evaluation. Social workers seek to enhance the capacity of people to address their own needs. Social workers also seek to promote the responsiveness of organizations, communities, and other social institutions to individuals' needs and social problems. The mission of the social work profession is rooted in a set of core values. These core values, embraced by social workers throughout the profession's history, are the foundation of social work's unique purpose and perspective: service social justice dignity and worth of the person importance of human relationships integrity competence. This constellation of core values reflects what is unique to the social work profession. Core values, and the principles that flow from them, must be balanced within the context and complexity of the human experience. Purpose of the NASW Code of Ethics Professional ethics are at the core of social work. The profession has an obligation to articulate its basic values, ethical principles, and ethical standards. The NASW Code of Ethics sets forth these values, principles, and standards to guide social workers' conduct. The Code is relevant to all social workers and social work students, regardless of their professional functions, the settings in which they work, or the populations they serve. The NASW Code of Ethics serves six purposes: http://www.wcu.edu/as/socialwork/manuals/NASW.html 2/9/99 Code of Ethics Page 2 of 18 1. The Code identifies core values on which social work's mission is based. 2. The Code summarizes broad ethical principles that reflect the profession's core values and establishes a set of specific ethical standards that should be used to guide social work practice. 3. The Code is designed to help social workers identify relevant considerations when professional obligations conflict or ethical uncertainties arise. 4. The Code provides ethical standards to which the general public can hold the social work profession accountable. 5. The Code socializes practitioners new to the field to social work's mission, values, ethical principles, and ethical standards. 6. The Code articulates standards that the social work profession itself can use to assess whether social workers have engaged in unethical conduct. NASW has formal procedures to adjudicate ethics complaints filed against its members. 1 In subscribing to this Code, social workers are required to cooperate in its implementation, participate in NASW adjudication proceedings, and abide by any NASW disciplinary rulings or sanctions based on it. I For information on NASW adjudication procedures, see NASW Procedures for the Adjudication of Grievances. The Code offers a set of values, principles, and standards to guide decision making and conduct when ethical issues arise. It does not provide a set of rules that prescribe how social workers should act in all situations. Specific applications of the Code must take into account the context in which it is being considered and the possibility of conflicts among the Code's values, principles, and standards. Ethical responsibilities flow from all human relationships, from the personal and familial to the social and professional. Further, the NASW Code of Ethics does not specify which values, principles, and standards are most important and ought to outweigh others in instances when they conflict. Reasonable differences of opinion can and do exist among social workers with respect to the ways in which values, ethical principles, and ethical standards should be rank ordered when they conflict. Ethical decision making in a given situation must apply the informed judgment of the individual social worker and should also consider how the issues would be judged in a peer review process where the ethical standards of the profession would be applied. Ethical decision making is a process. There are many instances in social work where simple answers are not available to resolve complex ethical issues. Social workers should take into consideration all the values, principles, and standards in this Code that are relevant to any situation in which ethical judgment is warranted. Social workers' decisions and actions should be consistent with the spirit as well as the letter of this Code. In addition to this Code, there are many other sources of information about ethical thinking that may be useful. Social workers should consider ethical theory and principles generally, social work theory and research, laws, regulations, agency policies, and other relevant codes of ethics, recognizing that among codes of ethics social workers should consider the NASW Code of Ethics as their primary source. Social workers also should be aware of the impact on ethical decision making of their clients' and their own personal values and cultural and religious beliefs and practices. They should be aware of any conflicts between personal and professional values and deal with them responsibly. For additional guidance social workers should consult the relevant literature on professional ethics and ethical decision making and seek appropriate consultation when faced with ethical dilemmas. This may involve consultation with an agency-based or social work organization's ethics committee, a regulatory body, knowledgeable colleagues, supervisors, or legal counsel. Instances may arise when social workers' ethical obligations conflict with agency policies or relevant http://www.wcu.edu/as/socialwork/manuals/NASW.html 2/9/99 Code of Ethics Page 3 of 18 laws or regulations. When such conflicts occur, social workers must make a responsible effort to resolve the conflict in a manner that is consistent with the values, principles, and standards expressed in this Code. If a reasonable resolution of the conflict does not appear possible, social workers should seek proper consultation before making a decision. The NASW Code of Ethics is to be used by NASW and by individuals, agencies, organizations, and bodies (such as licensing and regulatory boards, professional liability insurance providers, courts of law, agency boards of directors, government agencies, and other professional groups) that choose to adopt it or use it as a frame of reference. Violation of standards in this Code does not automatically imply legal liability or violation of the law. Such determination can only be made in the context of legal and judicial proceedings. Alleged violations of the Code would be subject to a peer review process. Such processes are generally separate from legal or administrative procedures and insulated from legal review or proceedings to allow the profession to counsel and discipline its own members. A code of ethics cannot guarantee ethical behavior. Moreover, a code of ethics cannot resolve all ethical issues or disputes or capture the richness and complexity involved in striving to make responsible choices within a moral community. Rather, a code of ethics sets forth values, ethical principles, and ethical standards to which professionals aspire and by which their actions can be judged. Social workers' ethical behavior should result from their personal commitment to engage in ethical practice. The NASW Code of Ethics reflects the commitment of all social workers to uphold the profession's values and to act ethically. Principles and standards must be applied by individuals of good char-acter who discern moral questions and, in good faith, seek to make reliable ethical judgments. Ethical Principles The following broad ethical principles are based on social work's core values of service, social justice, dignity and worth of the person, importance of human relationships, integrity, and competence. These principles set forth ideals to which all social workers should aspire. Value: Service Ethical Principle: Social workers' primary goal is to help people in need and to address social problems. Social workers elevate service to others above self-interest. Social workers draw on their knowledge, values, and skills to help people in need and to address social problems. Social workers are encouraged to volunteer some portion of their professional skills with no expectation of significant financial return (pro bono service). Value: Social Justice Ethical Principle: Social workers challenge social injustice. Social workers pursue social change, particularly with and on behalf of vulnerable and oppressed individuals and groups of people. Social workers' social change efforts are focused p \"rimarily on issues of poverty, unemployment, discrimination, and other forms of social injustice. These activities seek to promote sensitivity to and knowledge about oppression and cultural and ethnic diversity. Social workers strive to ensure access to needed information, services, and resources; equality of opportunity; and meaningful participation in decision making for all people. Value: Dignity and Worth of the Person Ethical Principle: Social workers respect the inherent dignity and worth of the person. Social workers treat each person in a caring and respectful fashion, mindful of individual differences http://www.wcu.edu/as/socialwork/manualsFNAS W.html 2/9/99 Code of Ethics Page 4 of 18 and cultural and ethnic diversity. Social workers promote clients' socially responsible self-determination. Social workers seek to enhance clients' capacity and opportunity to change and to address their own needs. Social workers are cognizant of their dual responsibility to clients and to the broader society. They seek to resolve conflicts between clients' interests and the broader society's interests in a socially responsible manner consistent with the values, ethical principles, and ethical standards of the profession. Value: Importance of Human Relationships Ethical Principle: Social workers recognize the central importance of human relationships. Social workers understand that relationships between and among people are an important vehicle for change. Social workers engage people as partners in the helping process. Social workers seek to strengthen relationships among people in a purposeful effort to promote, restore, maintain, and enhance the well-being of individuals, families, social groups, organizations, and communities. Value: Integrity Ethical Principle: Social workers behave in a trustworthy manner. Social workers are continually aware of the profession's mission, values, ethical principles, and ethical standards and practice in a manner consistent with them. Social workers act honestly and responsibly and promote ethical practices on the part of the organizations with which they are affiliated. Value: Competence Ethical Principle: Social workers practice within their areas of competence and develop and enhance their professional expertise. Social workers continually strive to increase their professional knowledge and skills and to apply them in practice. Social workers should aspire to contribute to the knowledge base of the profession. Ethical Standards The following ethical standards are relevant to the professional activities of all social workers. These standards concern (1) social workers' ethical responsibilities to clients, (2) social workers' ethical responsibilities to colleagues, (3) social workers' ethical responsibilities in practice settings, (4) social workers' ethical responsibilities as professionals, (5) social workers' ethical responsibilities to the social work profession, and (6) social workers' ethical responsibilities to the broader society. Some of the standards that follow are enforceable guidelines for professional conduct, and some are aspirational. The extent to which each standard is enforceable is a matter of professional judgment to be exercised by those responsible for reviewing alleged violations of ethical standards. 1. Social Workers' Ethical Responsibilities to Clients 1.01 Commitment to Clients Social workers' primary responsibility is to promote the well being of clients. In general, clients' interests are primary. However, social workers' responsibility to the larger society or specific legal obligations may on limited occasions supersede the loyalty owed clients, and clients should be so advised. (Examples include when a social worker is required by law to report that a client has abused a child or has threatened to harm self or others.) 1.02 Self-Determination http://www.wcu.edu/as/socialwork/manuals/NASW.html 2/9/99 Code of Ethics Page 5 of 18 Social workers respect and promote the fight of clients to self-determination and assist clients in their efforts to identify and clarify their goals. Social workers may limit clients' right to self-determination when, in the social workers' professional judgment, clients' actions or potential actions pose a serious, foreseeable, and imminent risk to themselves or others. 1.03 Informed Consent (a) Social workers should provide services to clients only in the context of a professional relationship based, when appropriate, on valid informed consent. Social workers should use clear and understandable language to inform clients of the purpose of the services, risks related to the services, limits to services because of the requirements of a third-party payer, relevant costs, reasonable alternatives, clients' right to refuse or withdraw consent, and the time frame covered by the consent. Social workers should provide clients with an opportunity to ask questions. (b) In instances when clients are not literate or have difficulty understanding the primary language used in the practice setting, social workers should take steps to ensure clients' comprehension. This may include providing clients with a detailed verbal explanation or arranging for a qualified interpreter or translator whenever possible. (c) In instances when clients lack the capacity to provide informed consent, social workers should protect clients' interests by seeking permission from an appropriate third party, informing clients consistent with the clients' level of understanding. In such instances social workers should seek to ensure that the third party acts in a manner consistent with clients' wishes and interests. Social workers should take reasonable steps to enhance such clients' ability to give informed consent. (d) In instances when clients are receiving services involuntarily, social workers should provide information about the nature and extent of services and about the extent of clients' right to refuse service. (e) Social workers who provide services via electronic media (such as computer, telephone, radio, and television) should inform recipients of the limitations and risks associated with such services. (f) Social workers should obtain clients' informed consent before audio taping or videotaping clients or permitting observation of services to clients by a third party. 1.04 Competence (a) Social workers should provide services and represent themselves as competent only within the boundaries of their education, training, license, certification, consultation received, supervised experience, or other relevant professional experience. (b) Social workers should provide services in substantive areas or use intervention techniques or approaches that are new to them only after engaging in appropriate study, training, consultation, and supervision from people who are competent in those interventions or techniques. (c) When generally recognized standards do not exist with respect to an emerging area of practice, social workers should exercise careful judgment and take responsible steps (including appropriate education, research, training, consultation, and supervision) to ensure the competence of their work and to protect clients from harm. 1.05 Cultural Competence and Social Diversity http://www.wcu.edu/as/socialwork/manuals/NASW.html 2/9/99 Code of Ethics Page 6 of 18 (a) Social workers should understand culture and its function in human behavior and society, recognizing the strengths that exist in all cultures. (b) Social workers should have a knowledge base of their clients' cultures and be able to demonstrate competence in the provision of services that are sensitive to clients' cultures and to differences among people and cultural groups. (c) Social workers should obtain education about and seek to understand the nature of social diversity and oppression with respect to race, ethnicity, national origin, color, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, political belief, religion, and mental or physical disability. 1.06 Conflicts of Interest (a) Social workers should be alert to and avoid conflicts of interest that interfere with the exercise of professional discretion and impartial judgment. Social workers should inform clients when a real or potential conflict of interest arises and take reasonable steps to resolve the issue in a manner that makes the clients' interests primary and protects clients' interests to the greatest extent possible. In some cases, protecting clients' interests may require termination of the professional relationship with proper referral of the client. (b) Social workers should not take unfair advantage of any professional relationship or exploit others to further their personal, religious, political, or business interests. (c) Social workers should not engage in dual or multiple relationships with clients or former clients in which there is a risk of exploitation or potential harm to the client. In instances when dual or multiple relationships are unavoidable, social workers should take steps to protect clients and are responsible for setting clear, appropriate, and culturally sensitive boundaries. (Dual or multiple relationships occur when social workers relate to clients in more than one relationship, whether professional, social, or business. Dual or multiple relationships can occur simultaneously or consecutively.) (d) When social workers provide services to two or more people who have a relationship with each other (for example, couples, family members), social workers should clarify with all parties which individuals will be considered clients and the nature of social workers' professional obligations to the various individuals who are receiving services. Social workers who anticipate a conflict of interest among the individuals receiving services or who anticipate having to perform in potentially conflicting roles (for example, when a social worker is asked to testify in a child custody dispute or divorce proceedings involving clients) should clarify their role with the parties involved and take appropriate action to minimize any conflict of interest. 1.07 Privacy and Confidentiality (a) Social workers should respect clients' right to privacy. Social workers should not solicit private information from clients unless it is essential to providing services or conducting social work evaluation or research. Once private information is shared, standards of confidentiality apply. Co) Social workers may disclose confidential information when appropriate with valid consent from a client or a person legally authorized to consent on behalf of a client. (c) Social workers should protect the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of professional service, except for compelling professional reasons. The general expectation that social workers will keep information confidential does not apply when disclosure is necessary to prevent serious, foreseeable, and imminent harm to a client or other identifiable person or when laws or regulations require disclosure without a client's consent. In all http://www.wcu.edu/as/socialwork/manuals/NASW.html 2/9/99 Code of Ethics Page 7 of 18 instances, social workers should disclose the least amount of confidential information necessary to achieve the desired purpose; only information that is directly relevant to the purpose for which the disclosure is made should be revealed. (d) Social workers should inform clients, to the extent possible, about the disclosure of confidential information and the potential consequences, when feasible before the disclosure is made. This applies whether social workers disclose confidential information on the basis of a legal requirement or client consent. (e) Social workers should discuss with clients and other interested parties the nature of confidentiality and limitations of clients' right to confidentiality. Social workers should review with clients' circumstances where confidential information may be requested and where disclosure of confidential information may be legally required. This discussion should occur as soon as possible in the social worker-client relationship and as needed throughout the course of the relationship. (f) When social workers provide counseling services to families, couples, or groups, social workers should seek agreement among the parties involved concerning each individual's right to confidentiality and obligation to preserve the confidentiality of information shared by others. Social workers should inform participants in family, couples, or group counseling that social workers cannot guarantee that all participants will honor such agreements. (g) Social workers should inform clients involved in family, couples, marital, or group counseling of the social worker's, employer's, and agency's policy concerning the social worker's disclosure of confidential information among the parties involved in the counseling. (h) Social workers should not disclose confidential information to third-party payers unless clients have authorized such disclosure. (i) Social workers should not discuss confidential information in any setting unless privacy can be ensured. Social workers should not discuss confidential information in public or semipublic areas such as hallways, waiting rooms, elevators, and restaurants. (j) Social workers should protect the confidentiality of clients during legal proceedings to the extent permitted by law. When a court of law or other legally authorized body orders social workers to disclose confidential or privileged information without a client's consent and such disclosure could cause harm to the client, social workers should request that the court withdraw the order or limit the order as narrowly as possible or maintain the records under seal, unavailable for public inspection. (k) Social workers should protect the confidentiality of clients when responding to requests from members of the media. (1) Social workers should protect the confidentiality of clients' written and electronic records and other sensitive information. Social workers should take reasonable steps to ensure that clients' records are stored in a secure location and that clients' records are not available to others who are not authorized to have access. (m) Social workers should take precautions to ensure and maintain the confidentiality of information transmitted to other parties through the use of computers, electronic mail, facsimile machines, telephones and telephone answering machines, and other electronic or computer technology. Disclosure of identifying information should be avoided whenever possible. (n) Social workers should transfer or dispose of clients' records in a manner that protects clients' confidentiality and is consistent with state statutes governing records and social work http://www.wcu.edu/as/socialwork/manuals/NASW.html 2/9/99 Code of Ethics Page 8 of 18 licensure. (o) Social workers should take reasonable precautions to protect client confidentiality in the event of the social worker's termination of practice, incapacitation, or death. (p) Social workers should not disclose identifying information when discussing clients for teaching or training purposes unless the client has consented to disclosure of confidential information. (q) Social workers should not disclose identifying information when discussing clients with consultants unless the client has consented to disclosure of confidential information or there is a compelling need for such disclosure. (r) Social workers should protect the confidentiality of deceased clients consistent with the preceding standards. 1.08 Access to Records (a) Social workers should provide clients with reasonable access to records concerning the clients. Social workers who are concerned that clients' access to their records could cause serious misunderstanding or harm to the client should provide assistance in interpreting the records and consultation with the client regarding the records. Social workers should limit clients' access to their records, or portions of their records, only in exceptional circumstances when there is compelling evidence that such access would cause serious harm to the client. Both clients' requests and the rationale for withholding some or all of the record should be documented in clients' files. (b) When providing clients with access to their records, social workers should take steps to protect the confidentiality of other individuals identified or discussed in such records. 1.09 Sexual Relationships (a) Social workers should under no circumstances engage in sexual activities or sexual contact with current clients, whether such contact is consensual or forced. (b) Social workers should not engage in sexual activities or sexual contact with clients' relatives or other individuals with whom clients maintain a close personal relationship when there is a risk of exploitation or potential harm to the client. Sexual activity or sexual contact with clients' relatives or other individuals with whom clients maintain a personal relationship has the potential to be harmful to the client and may make it difficult for the social worker and client to maintain appropriate professional boundaries. Social workers--not their clients, their clients' relatives, or other individuals with whom the client maintains a personal relationship--assume the full burden for setting clear, appropriate, and culturally sensitive boundaries. (c) Social workers should not engage in sexual activities or sexual contact with former clients because of the potential for harm to the client. If social workers engage in conduct contrary to this prohibition or claim that an exception to this prohibition is warranted because of extraordinary circumstances, it is social workers--not their clients--who assume the full burden of demonstrating that the former client has not been exploited, coerced, or manipulated, intentionally or unintentionally. (d) Social workers should not provide clinical services to individuals with whom they have had a prior sexual relationship. Providing clinical services to a former sexual partner has the potential to be harmful to the individual and is likely to make it difficult for the social worker and individual to maintain appropriate professional boundaries. http://www.wcu.edu/as/socialwork/manuals/NASW.html 2/9/99 Code of Ethics Page 9 of 18 1.10 Physical Contact Social workers should not engage in physical contact with clients when there is a possibility of psychological harm to the client as a result of the contact (such as cradling or caressing clients). Social workers who engage in appropriate physical contact with clients are responsible for setting clear, appropriate, and culturally sensitive boundaries that govern such physical contact. 1.11 Sexual Harassment Social workers should not sexually harass clients. Sexual harassment includes sexual advances, sexual solicitation, requests for sex-usual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. 1.12 Derogatory Language Social workers should not use derogatory language in their written or verbal communications to or about clients. Social workers should use accurate and respectful language in all communications to and about clients. 1.13 Payment for Services (a) When setting fees, social workers should ensure that the fees are fair, reasonable, and commensurate with the services performed. Consideration should be given to clients' ability to pay. (b) Social workers should avoid accepting goods or services from clients as payment for professional services. Bartering arrangements, particularly involving services, create the potential for conflicts of interest, exploitation, and inappropriate boundaries in social workers' relationships with clients. Social workers should explore and may participate in bartering only in very limited circumstances when it can be demonstrated that such arrangements are an accepted practice among professionals in the local community, considered to be essential for the provision of services, negotiated without coercion, and entered into at the client's initiative and with the client's informed consent. Social workers who accept goods or services from clients as payment for professional services assume the full burden of demonstrating that this arrangement will not be detrimental to the client or the professional relationship. (c) Social workers should not solicit a private fee or other remuneration for providing services to clients who are entitled to such available services through the social workers' employer or agency. 1.14 Clients Who Lack Decision-Making Capacity When social workers act on behalf of clients who lack the capacity to make informed decisions, social workers should take reasonable steps to safeguard the interests and rights of those clients. 1.15 Interruption of Services Social workers should make reasonable efforts to ensure continuity of services in the event that services are interrupted by factors such as unavailability, relocation, illness, disability, or death. 1.16 Termination of Services (a) Social workers should terminate services to clients and professional relationships with them when such services and relationships are no longer required or no longer serve the http://www.wcu.edu/as/socialwork/manuals/NASW.html 2/9/99 Code of Ethics Page 10 of 18 clients' needs or interests. (b) Social workers should take reasonable steps to avoid abandoning clients who are still in need of services. Social workers should withdraw services precipitously only under unusual circumstances, giving careful consideration to all factors in the situation and taking care to minimize possible adverse effects. Social workers should assist in making appropriate arrangements for continuation of services when necessary. (c) Social workers in fee-for-service settings may terminate services to clients who are not paying an overdue balance if the financial contractual arrangements have been made clear to the client, if the client does not pose an imminent danger to self or others, and if the clinical and other consequences of the current nonpayment have been addressed and discussed with the client. (d) Social workers should not terminate services to pursue a social, financial, or sexual relationship with a client. (e) options for the continuation of services and of the benefits and risks of the options. 2. Social Workers' Ethical Responsibilities to Colleagues 2.01 Respect (a) Social workers should treat colleagues with respect and should represent accurately and fairly the qualifications, views, and obligations of colleagues. (b) Social workers should avoid unwarranted negative criticism of colleagues in communications with clients or with other professionals. Unwarranted negative criticism may include demeaning comments that refer to colleagues' level of competence or to individuals' attributes such as race, ethnicity, national origin, color, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, political belief, religion, and mental or physical disability. (c) Social workers should cooperate with social work colleagues and with colleagues of other professions when such cooperation serves the well-being of clients. 2.02 Confidentiality Social workers should respect confidential information shared by colleagues in the course of their professional relationships and transactions. Social workers should ensure that such colleagues understand social workers' obligation to respect confidentiality and any exceptions related to it. 2.03 Interdisciplinary Collaboration (a) Social workers who are members of an interdisciplinary team should participate in and contribute to decisions that affect the well-being of clients by drawing on the perspectives, values, and experiences of the social work profession. Professional and ethical obligations of the interdisciplinary team as a whole and of its individual members should be clearly established. (b) Social workers for whom a team decision raises ethical concerns should attempt to resolve the disagreement through appropriate channels. If the disagreement cannot be resolved, social workers should pursue other avenues to address their concerns consistent with client well-being. 2.04 Disputes Involving Colleagues http://www.wcu.edu/as/socialwork/manuals/NASW.html 2/9/99 Code of Ethics Page 11 of 18 (a) Social workers should not take advantage of a dispute between a colleague and an employer to obtain a position or otherwise advance the social workers' own interests. (b) Social workers should not exploit clients in disputes with colleagues or engage clients in any inappropriate discussion of conflicts between social workers and their colleagues. 2.05 Consultation (a) Social workers should seek the advice and counsel of colleagues whenever such consultation is in the best interests of clients. (b) Social workers should keep themselves informed about colleagues' areas of expertise and competencies. Social workers should seek consultation only from colleagues who have demonstrated knowledge, expertise, and competence related to the subject of the consultation. (c) When consulting with colleagues about clients, social workers should disclose the least amount of information necessary to achieve the purposes of the consultation. 2.06 Referral for Services (a) Social workers should refer clients to other professionals when the other professionals' specialized knowledge or expertise is needed to serve clients fully or when social workers believe that they are not being effective or making reasonable progress with clients and that additional service is required. (b) Social workers who refer clients to other professionals should take appropriate steps to facilitate an orderly transfer of responsibility. Social workers who refer clients to other professionals should disclose, with clients' consent, all pertinent information to the new service providers. (c) Social workers are prohibited from giving or receiving payment for a referral when no professional service is provided by the referring social worker. 2.07 Sexual Relationships (a) Social workers who function as supervisors or educators should not engage in sexual activities or contact with supervisees, students, trainees, or other colleagues over whom they exercise professional authority. (b) Social workers should avoid engaging in sexual relationships with colleagues when there is potential for a conflict of interest. Social workers who become involved in, or anticipate becoming involved in, a sexual relationship with a colleague have a duty to transfer professional responsibilities, when necessary, to avoid a conflict of interest. 2.08 Sexual Harassment Social workers should not sexually harass supervisees, students, trainees, or colleagues. Sexual harassment includes sexual advances, sexual solicitation, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. 2.09 Impairment of Colleagues (a) Social workers who have direct knowledge of a social work colleague's impairment that is due to personal problems, psychosocial distress, substance abuse, or mental health difficulties and that interferes with practice effectiveness should consult with that colleague when feasible and assist the colleague in taking remedial action. http://www.wcu.edu/as/socialwork/manuals/NASW.html 2/9/99 Code of Ethics Page 12 of 18 (b) Social workers who believe that a social work colleague is incompetent and has not taken adequate steps to address the incompetence should take action through appropriate channels established by employers, agencies, NASW, licensing and regulatory bodies, and other professional organizations. 2.10 Incompetence of Colleagues (a) Social workers who have direct knowledge of a social work colleague's incompetence should consult with that colleague in taking remedial action. (b) Social workers who believe that a social work colleague is incompetent and has not taken adequate steps to address the incompetence should take action through appropriate channels established by employers, agencies, NASW, licensing and regulatory bodies and other professional organizations. 2.11 Unethical Conduct of Colleagues (a) Social workers should take adequate measures to discourage, prevent, expose, and correct the unethical conduct of colleagues. (b) Social workers should be knowledgeable about established policies and procedures for handling concerns about colleagues' unethical behavior. Social workers should be familiar with national, state, and local procedures for handling ethics complaints. These include policies and procedures created by NASW, licensing and regulatory bodies, employers, agencies, and other professional organizations. (c) Social workers who believe that a colleague has acted unethically should seek resolution by discussing their concerns with the colleague when feasible and when such discussion is likely to be productive. (d) When necessary, social workers who believe that a colleague has acted unethically should take action through appropriate formal channels (such as contacting a state licensing board or regulatory body, an NASW committee on inquiry, or other professional ethics committees). (e) Social workers should defend and assist colleagues who are unjustly charged with unethical conduct. 3. Social Workers' Ethical Responsibilities in Practice Settings 3.01 Supervision and Consultation (a) Social workers who provide supervision or consultation should have the necessary knowledge and skill to supervise or consult appropriately and should do so only within their areas of knowledge and competence.

(d) Social workers should store records following the termination of services to ensure reasonable future access. Records should be maintained for the number of years required by state statutes or relevant contracts. 3.05 Billing Social workers should establish and maintain billing practices that accurately reflect the nature and extent of services provided and that identify who provided the service in the practice setting. 3.06 Client Transfer (a) When an individual who is receiving services from another agency or colleague contacts a social worker for services, the social worker should carefully consider the client's needs before agreeing to provide services. To minimize possible confusion and conflict, social workers should discuss with potential clients the nature of the clients' current relationship with other service providers and the implications, including possible benefits or risks, of entering into a relationship with a new service provider. (b) If a new client has been served by another agency or colleague, social workers should discuss with the client whether consultation with the previous service provider is in the client's best interest. 3.07 Administration http://www.wcu.edu/as/socialwork/manuals/NASW.html 2/9/99 Code of Ethics Page 14 of 18 (a) Social work administrators should advocate within and outside their agencies for adequate resources to meet clients' needs. (b) Social workers should advocate for resource allocation prOcedures that are open and fair.

(b) Social workers should promote and facilitate evaluation and research to contribute to the http://www.wcu.edu/as/socialwork/manuals/NASW.html 2/9/99 Code of Ethics Page 17 of 18 development of knowledge. (c) Social workers should critically examine and keep current with emerging knowledge relevant to social work and fully use evaluation and research evidence in their professional practice. (d) Social workers engaged in evaluation or research should carefully consider possible consequences and should follow guidelines developed for the protection of evaluation and research participants. Appropriate institutional review boards should be consulted. (e) Social workers engaged in evaluation or research should obtain voluntary and written informed consent from participants, when appropriate, without any implied or actual deprivation or penalty for refusal to participate; without undue inducement to participate; and with due regard for participants' well-being, privacy, and dignity. Informed consent should include information about the nature, extent, and duration of the participation requested and disclosure of the risks and benefits of participation in the research. (f) When evaluation or research participants are incapable of giving informed consent, social workers should provide an appropriate explanation to the participants, obtain the participants' assent to the extent they are able, and obtain written consent from an appropriate proxy. (g) Social workers should never design or conduct evaluation or research that does not use consent procedures, such as certain forms of naturalistic observation and archival research, unless rigorous and responsible review of the research has found it to be justified because of its prospective scientific, educational, or applied value and unless equally effective alternative procedures that do not involve waiver of consent are not feasible. (h) Social workers should inform participants of their right to withdraw from evaluation and research at any time without penalty. (i) Social workers should take appropriate steps to ensure that participants in evaluation and research have access to appropriate supportive services. (j) Social workers engaged in evaluation or research should protect participants from unwarranted physical or mental distress, harm, danger, or deprivation. (k) Social workers engaged in the evaluation of services should discuss collected information only for professional purposes and only with people professionally concerned with this information. (1) Social workers engaged in evaluation or research should ensure the anonymity or confidentiality of participants and of the data obtained from them.

(m) Social workers who report evaluation and research results should protect participants' confidentiality by omitting identifying information unless proper consent has been obtained authorizing disclosure. (n) Social workers should report evaluation and research findings accurately. They should not fabricate or falsify results and should take steps to correct any errors later found in published data using standard publication methods. (o) Social workers engaged in evaluation or research should be alert to and avoid conflicts of interest and dual relationships with participants, should inform participants when a real or potential conflict of interest arises, and should take steps to resolve the issue in a manner that http://www.wcu.edu/as/socialwork/manuals/NASW.html 2/9/99 Code of Ethics Page 18 of 18 makes participants' interests primary. (p) Social workers should educate themselves, their students, and their colleagues about responsible research practices. 6 Social Workers' Ethical Responsibilities to the Broader Society 6.01 Social Welfare Social workers should promote the general welfare of society, from local to global levels, and the development of people, their communities, and their environments. Social workers should advocate for living conditions conducive to the fulfillment of basic human needs and should promote social, economic, political, and cultural values and institutions that are compatible with the realization of social justice. 6.02 Public Participation Social workers should facilitate informed participation by the public in shaping social policies and institutions. 6.03 Public Emergencies Social workers should provide appropriate professional services in public emergencies to the greatest extent possible. 6.04 Social and Political Action (a) Social workers should engage in social and political action that seeks to ensure that all people have equal access to the resources, employment, services, and opportunities they require to meet their basic human needs and to develop fully. Social workers should be aware of the impact of the political arena on practice and should advocate for changes in policy and legislation to improve social conditions in order to meet basic human needs and promote social justice.

The three components of the study were: (1) national surveys to identify the types of child maltreatment cases that were most likely to be investigated jointly and to assess the benefits of and barriers to effective implementation, (2) case studies to identify approaches that facilitate joint investigations, and (3) models developed for communities to use in designing joint investigation programs. Results from the national surveys indicate that, although joint investigations of child maltreatment allegations were fairly common, there was a need for improved joint investigation programs. The authors list the ten recommendations resulting from the case studies. Three joint investigation program models are described: one model that uses existing resources, the multidisciplinary interview center model, and the child advocacy center model. A list of joint investigation training resources is also included.

The Impact of Joint Law Enforcement/Child Protective Services Investi.qation in Child Abuse Cases Tjaden, P.G.; Anhalt, J. Final Report 29 pp. Copyright June 1995 Publication Information: Center for Policy Research, Denver, CO Distributed by: Center for Policy Research 1570 Emerson St. Denver, CO 80218 (303) 837-1557 cntrpolres@uswest, net Sponsored by: National Center for Child Abuse and Neglect (DHHS), Washington, DC This article summarizes the findings of a study comparing the prevalence and effectiveness of independent child protective services investigations and joint law enforcement-child protective services investigations in cases of suspected child abuse. Using information extracted for child protective services, police, and criminal court records in five jurisdictions, the study found that caseworkers and police officers conducted joint investigations in 53 percent of the 1,828 cases in the sample. Four case characteristics have significant power to predict the occurrence of the joint investigation: a law enforcement reporter, emergency medical treatment to the victim at the time of the report, allegations of serious abuse, and allegations of sexual abuse. Compared to independent investigations, joint investigations take longer and are more thorough than independent investigations. They also result in significantly more protective custody placements, perpetrator departures form the home, perpetrator confessions, victim corroborations, substantiated reports, dependency filings, and criminal prosecutions.

Team structure and effectiveness are described. The article also profiles joint investigation teams in two jurisdictions. Community multidisciplinary teams help to coordinate the response of concerned agencies to cases of child abuse. Specifically, law enforcement and child protective services workers form joint investigation teams to examine cases of child sexual abuse, child fatalities and sometimes cases of severe physical abuse and neglect. The benefits of joint investigation teams include reducing the number of interviews for the child, eliminating duplication of effort, improving quality of evidence, enhancing communication between agencies and facilitating the transition to treatment.

Child Protective Investigation Team Training. Tennessee Univ., Knoxville. Office of Research and Public Service Distributed by: Tennessee University Office of Research and Public Service Knoxville, TN 37996 This paper discusses the role of law enforcement in response to child abuse or neglect. An overview of the child protection system and the role of law enforcement are presented. The roles of law enforcement professionals focus on roles of prevention and advocacy, reporting, support to Child Protective Services, immediate emergency response, investigative responsibility, and supporting the child victim in preparing for and surviving the experience of prosecution. Law enforcement views child abuse and neglect not as a social problem, but in the context of a criminal offense. Issues related to prosecuting the crimes of child abuse and neglect include the victims' young age, the resemblance of abuse and non-abuse conditions, and the occurrence of the crime in private places. The importance of specialized skills and training are also discussed. The team investigation concept is explored where both CPS and law enforcement work collaboratively sharing information, assigning investigative tasks, and participating in a shared decision making process. The independent goals of each discipline are still met, by the team actively coordinating the process and utilizing the resources available through all involved disciplines. Specific elements identified by participants in a national consensus building conference to facilitate the team approach of CPS and law enforcement are outlined. Recommendations to minimize conflicts between team members are discussed including establishing formal teams on community and state levels, establishing investigative protocols, providing adequate personnel to both agencies, and joint training so as to provide the opportunity to hear the same messages and learn skills together. Specific recommendations include: reach out to the other discipline, share professional information, keep communication open, and confront conflicts openly.

The projects evolved from a 1982 Child Fatality Inquiry Work Group convened to develop preliminary definitions for a model child fatality protocol for investigating child fatalities. The New York City Child Fatality Project identifies key events in the lives of children and families before and after the children died from abuse or neglect. Data on 96 deaths during the first half of 1980 were collected form several sources. Findings indicated that 45 of the 96 cases were determined to be the result of abuse or neglect, 24 were possible cases of abuse or neglect, and 27 were caused by other factors. Abuse alone accounted for 47 percent of the deaths. Neglect accounted for 44 percent, and elements of abuse and neglect accounted for the remaining 9 percent of the cases. New York City will apply the methodology tested in its preliminary study to establish a multidisciplinary team to examine 200 new child deaths caused by trauma, malnutrition, or otherwise suspicious causes, including accidents that may be the result of abuse or neglect. One joint demonstration project, located in Illinois and Louisiana, is developing multidisciplinary independent review committees for examining child fatalities caused by maltreatment. The St. Louis Child Abuse Network has developed a multidisciplinary board of inquiry to identify interventions to prevent child abuse and neglect fatalities. The St. Louis project also provides counseling for child protection workers. Such systematic efforts to examine factors contributing to non-accidental child fatalities will enable child protection agencies to improve their services to prevent nonaccidental child fatalities.

Child Fatality review teams are formed at the local level and coordinated by the State Child Fatality Review Team Committee. The overall goals of the review system are to collect accurate data about the causes of death of children and promote a public health approach to reduce the number of preventable deaths. The teams are also designed to improve collaboration among concerned agencies and improve investigation and prosecution. Team members include representatives from the offices of police, sheriff, child protective services, criminal prosecutor, medical examiner, and pediatrician. Communities may also appoint members from emergency medical services, mental health providers, public health professionals, child educators, child advocates, and childcare licensing agencies. Local officials or advocates who are organizing a team should first obtain the commitment of professionals and contact the state review team coordinator for materials and guidance. Core member agencies should be invited to join during the planning stages. The paper describes the role of each team member, team operating procedures, and meeting protocol. A list of national and state organizations and associations available for assistance is provided.

Multiple injuries in multiple planes of the body, coupled with a discrepant history=child abuse Burden of proof is \"higher\" in caretaker cases Charging Considerations Single injury or pattern of abuse over time? Loss of control or determined intent to harm? Those who don't intend harm usually feel remorse immediately upon recognizing what their conduct did and admit their actionsmaking up stories and covering up is excellent evidence of intent to harm Charging Considerations Serious injuries inflicted unintentionally (recklessly or with criminal negligence) may still demand prosecution How narrowly can the medical experts identify the \"window\" in which the injuries had to be inflicted? Who was with the child during that window? 3 The WHODUNIT-sorting among multiple possible perpetrators Don't give up until all bases have been touched Who has a history of violent conduct toward children?

Keep in mind that if one person caused the abuse/death and the other knows about it, they both may tell the same stupid stories! Which caretaker may have had \"motive\" to harm the child? Unwanted pregnancy, product of rape, insurance policy? 4 WHODUNIT? Who has the physical capability to inflict the injuries ? Who has shown age-inappropriate expectations of the child? Does one of the caretakers offer \"I was beaten as a child and I would never to this...?\" One caretaker critical of others discipline? Mental State and Actus Reus Medical experts will tell you how much force and what type of force caused the injuries-then that information must be translated into the state's theory It is no defense that the defendant did not know exactly what was happening neurologically to know the risk of harm Mental State and Actus Reus Nature of the act may often prove what intent or knowledge was involved Suffocation can occur unintentionally, such as keeping a child quiet-such acts are at least reckless. In most cases of suffocation, there is evidence of prior abuse and some evidence of motive to end the victim's life 5 Emotional Abuse Should there be criminal culpability for emotional abuse? Utah-2nd degree felony creating a severe developmental delay in child through any conduct Studies show neglect, demeaning or psychological terrorism can result in more severe problems than physical abuse Medical Examiner unable or unwilling to assign a cause of death It is still possible to get convictions in those cases through use of prior misconduct evidence and through excluding the possibility of natural or accidental causes of death ~,WI, g Q AUTOPSY Ask medical examiner to determine effects of malnutrition on the ultimate cause of death. Many deaths are classified from natural causes with malnutrition as a secondary cause. \"But For\" test - cases that list cause of death from natural causes with malnutrition as a secondary cause can still be prosecuted if the child would not have died but for the complications of malnutrition. 6 Unique Aspects of Child Homicide Cases Different causes of death - Different physiology Non-simultaneous times of injury or death Victim is moved, often several times Multiple scenes Preservation of scenes Background information on social pathology Anticipate the Defense- think like a defense attorney Accidental fall (generally head and abdomen trauma) Common medical findings: subdural, epidural and subarachnoid bleeds coupled with retinal hemorrhages Document age, location and condition of all injuries to the child Scene Investigation Photographs, diagrams, and videotapes of all possible scenes within window of opportunity-don't rely solely on the child's history Measurements of all surfaces from which child could have fallen; document condition of surrounding area Remove items for doctors to evaluate 7 Search Warrant Information Preference for warrant over consent Items most often requested; Medical records, appointment calendars, birth certificates, marriage records, food containers and food, soiled diapers, insurance records on all children, Trace evidence, bedding, suspects and victim clothing, occupancy documents, photos o,a.p.

State v. G.P., N. W. 2d 477 (Neb. 1990) Parental rights of non-abusing mother terminated based upon her failure to protect her children from abusive acts by father.

Inflicted injuries may be intentional or unintentional. Questions to ask to help separate accidental from inflicted injuries: What is the age of the patient? Development determines what kinds of injuries are likely. Is the history plausible? Could this injury have occurred as recounted by the caretaker? Does the history change with changing information given to the caretaker? Does the history change when related in subsequent accounts by other family members? Questions to ask to help separate accidental from inflicted injuries: Are there non-familial eye-witnesses to the event? Was the injury described by the caretaker actually unwitnessed by the caretaker? (\"Did you see this happen?\") Is the demeanor of the caretaker defensive, belligerent, hostile, passive or unconcerned and not in keeping with the patient's condition? Is the social situation in which the event occurred a high-risk environment? Mostly importantly, what else could have caused the observed injuries?

Caretaker slipped or tripped while cam/ing child 10. Injury inflicted by sibling 11. Child lef~ alone in dangerous situation (bathtub) for just a few moments 12. Child fell down stairs (or in a walker, or other baby equipment) Physical Abuse Types Head The key points in the anatomy of the head consist of the following layers: Scalp Pia-arachnoid Ventricles Bridging veins Mechanisms of Injury Hymel has outlined a model that explains isolated acceleration injuries: Head was injured by impulsive loading without impact (whiplash) Head was struck by a deformable, moving object over a large surface area leading to marked head acceleration Head was moving rapidly and contacted a deformable material over a large surface area In addition to these acceleration injuries, the head can also be compressed in a vise-like situation. Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) Shaken Impact Syndrome (SIS) The terms shaken baby syndrome (SBS) and shaken impact syndrome (SLS) refer to the signs and symptoms, as well as the clinical, radiographic and sometimes autopsy findings resulting from violent shaking of an infant or young child. Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) Shaken Impact Syndrome (SIS) Most common case of mortality from physical abuse Accounts for the most long term disability in infants and young children due to physical abuse Age of victims ranges from newborn to approximately 4 years of age Majority of cases occur before the infants' first birthday Average age of victim is between 3 and 8 months Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) Shaken Impact Syndrome (SIS) The usual trigger for shaking is inconsolable crying by the Infant The perpetrator loses control and grabs the infant, either by the thorax, the upper arms or the neck, and violently shakes the baby The tlme of shaking varies, usually ranging from 5 seconds to 15 or 20 seconds Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) Shaken Impact Syndrome (SIS) Shaking and the sudden deceleration of the head at the Ume of impact do several things: The veins that bridge from the brain to the dura, which is fixed to the inside of the skull, are stretched and, exceeding their elasticity, tear open and bleed, creating the subduraI hematoma The brain strikes the inner surface of the skull, causing direct trauma to the brain substance The deeper sb'uctures of the brain, the axons, can be broken, sheafing off during the commotion to the brain The lack of oxygen during shaking causes further irreversible damage to the brain substance Damaged nente ce~ls release chemicals which add to the oxygen deprivation and cause further damage to adjacent nerve cells IT IS THESE INJURIES TO THE BRAIN, NOT THE BLEEDING UNDER THE DURA OR ARACHNOID MEMBRANES, THAT CAUSE THE SIGNS, SYMPTOMS AND COURSE OF SHAKEN BABY/SHAKEN IMPACT SYNDROME Concomitant with the destruction of brain tissue are other injuries... The most significant of these are the retinal hemorrhages Skull fractures may be seen when there has been sufficient impact Posterior rib fractures may be seen reflecting the compression of the chest during shaking and the movement of the rib cage Bruising of the skin of the head, face and other parts of the body Resulting Signs & Symptoms Decreased responsiveness Irritability Lethargy and limpness Convulsions Vomiting Increased breathing rate Low body temperature and low heart rate Coma with fixed and dilated pupils Death Crush Injuries These injuries cause injuries to the brain by static loading as opposed to acceleration/deceleration injuries. When the head is crushed, such as when the head is run over by a vehicle, the skull and brain absorb the energy and my be severely or mildly damaged depending on the forces involved. However, the brain does not undergo the commotion associated with shaking and impact and so the Injury patterns may be quite different. Penetrating Injuries Gunshots, knives, blunt implements may cause penetrating injudes to the contents of the cranium. These are more easily diagnosed than the victim of shaking or shaking with impact because of the nature of the lesions. Physical Abuse Types Abdomen Abdominal Cavity SOLID HOLLOW liver spleen pancreas kidneys stomach, duodenum, Jejunum, small intestine, large intes~ne, bladder, ureters *Large and small blood vessels and nerves supply all of the organs & these are subject to injury as well Mechanisms of Injury Blunt abdominal trauma (e.g., a fist, foot, instrument, or appliance) strikes the abdomen and can cause trauma to the organ by direct contract or by forcing the organ against a hard surface. Direct blows disrupt the integrity of the solid organ. Hollow viscera are usually injured by sudden impingement against the abdominal portion of the spinal column. Distinguishing Between Accidental and Inflicted Injuries Accidental Inflicted Median Age 7 yrs. 8 mo. 2 yrs. 6 too. History Motor vehicle Discrepant history Medical Care Prompt Delayed Organ Involved Solid Hollow Mortality Rate 21% 53% Ledbetter et al studied 156 children under 13 years of age with abdominal injuries Order of Frequency of Involved Organs in Inflicted Injury: 1. Small Intestine - 30% duodenum 60% jejunum 10% terminal ileum 2. Liver 3. Pancreas Physical Abuse Types Thoracic The thorax is the rib cage and all the internal organs contained within it. Heart and great vessels going to and from the heart Lungs and the mediastinum containing blood vessels Nerves Esophagus Trachea Diaphragm Mechanisms of Injury Direct impacts, penetrations and compressions are the principle types of forces causing injury to the thorax. Direct major impacts can cause disturbance of cardiac rhythm leading to death, spontaneous rupture of the lung or hemorrhaging. Compressions of the rib cage can cause fractures of ribs, contusions and/or lacerations of the thoracic structures, bleeding and collections of blood within the pleural or pericardial membranes. Penetrating injuries can cause punctures of the lungs, heart or pericardial sac, massive hemorrhaging from heart or great vessels, or rupture of the esophagus, hypopharynx or trachea. Distinguishing Between Accidental and Inflicted Certain types and locations of thoradc injuries make them more likely to be inflicted than accidental; . Posterior rib fractures. These fractures are caused by fordng the posterior arcs of the ribs to migrate past the horizontal plane of the spine levering the rib attachment to the body of the vertebra against the transverse process of the vertebra, creating a characteristic fracture that is unlikely to be produced in any other fashion. c\" i\u007f,\u007f / i A,.-.-.:k perforation. Perforation of the posterior pharynx or upper esophagus in an infant or small child are unlikely accidents unless there is a clear history of the child having fallen with a sharp object in the mouth. These lesions, when treated early, should pose no threat to life, hut if left: untreated, can lead to infection, pneumothorax and death. (% Distinguishing Between Accidental and Inflicted (con't) . Chylothorax This unusual interruption of the lymphatics within the thorax allows milky chyle to leak into the thoracic cavity and, although not in itself likely to cause death, suggests significant trauma. When seen in a child death case, unless there is a history of motor vehicle crash or a fall from more than 3 stories, chylothorax is a highly suggestive sign of inflicted injury. Burns Anatomy of the Skin The skin consists of the supertidal layer, the epidermis, and the deeper layer, the dermis. Epidermal appendages include sweat glands, hair follicles, and the sebaceous (oil) glands. Both layers are richly supplied with blood vessels and nerves. Classification of Burn Injuries First Degree Involves o~ly the superftdal layer of the epidermis and is characterized by redness only I Second Extends into the dermis causing I Degree blistering and tissue loss I Entire dermis and appendages are ~amaged. I Third BEause U~e nerves are d~royed, areas of Degree u~in~ degree ~m have no pain sensaDon Extends beyond the subcutaneous Fourth tissue Into the muscles, bones Degree and joints Classification of Burn Injuries Second degree burns are also called partial thickness burns Third and fourth degree bums are also called full thickness burns Mechanism of Injury; Distinguishing between Accidental and Inflicted Immersion Burns Immersion Burns These bums are characterized by sharply demarcated margins of the bum, uniformity of the burn with sparing of skin surface by skin folds or protection from the burning agent. These burns most often involve the upper and lower extremities and the buttocks. Dry Contact Burns These burns are uniform in degree of burn, often involve exposed surfaces of the body (arms, legs, hands, feet) and are assodated with discrepant histories. Chemical Burns These are burns associated with add or alkali substances and may involve the skin or the internal organs, particularly the mouth, throat, esophagus or tracheo- bronchial tree. Pattern Burns Burns that conform to heated elements such as irons, grills, curling irons, cigarette lighters, or stove heating elements may be acddental or inflicted. The age of the child and the location of the bum, coupled with the history of how the burn occurred will in most cases be sufficient to make the distinction between accident and abuse. Physical Abuse Types Skeletal Injuries Factors increasing the likelihood that a fracture in childhood is due to abuse: Young age - Up to 70% of abusive fractures occur in infants under 1 year of age - 80% of all inflicted fractures are found in babies under 18 monks of age Children with disabilities and/or history of prematudty are at increased risk Associated other injuries More than one fracture Fractures in multiple locations Fractures in vadous stages of healing The skeletal survey is useful in children 2 years of age in which there is a suspicion of physical abuse of any kind. The survey includes: Skull: frontal and lateral views Spine: frontal and lateral projections Chest Extremities: Separate views of upper and lower extremities Humerus Common in abuse Usually in the middle or lower third of the shaft Elbow fractures more common in accidents, especially in older children, but if seen in children under 3 years of age, abuse should be considered Femur 60% of femoral fractures in children under 1 year are from abuse 20% of femoral fractures in children between 2-3 years of age are from abuse In another study, 31% of femoral fractures in children under 3 years of age were from abuse Femoral fractures arising from accidental causes are most often associated with major a~eleration/deceleratlon injuries or major blunt trauma. Motor vehicle crashes are the major cause. The type of fracture cannot be used to distinguish accidental from abusive. (Spiral fractures occur as the result of torsional forces that can be seen in accidents or abuse.) Metaphyseal Fractures The Classic Metaphyseal Lesion (CML) is diagnostic of abuse. No other mechanism of injury can cause this fracture. The fracture is across the zona spongiosa, the thinnest portion of the end of the long bones. It forms a disc-like fragment which can look like chips or a bucket-handle dependlng on the plane of projection of the x-ray beam. Mechanism of Production of the CML Clavicle . Commonly fractured long bone in both inflicted and accidental injury, usually in the middle thlrd of the bone Accidental fractures of the medial or lateral third are uncommon in the under-3 year old, but can result from shaking Rib Fractures (See Thoracic injuries) Vertebral fractures due to compression of vertebral bodies during shaking with hyper-extension or hyper-flexion Dating Fractures Four stages to bone injury: Soft callus formation occurs 10-14 days after fracture and can be seen as cottony shadows around the fracture line Skull fractures do not undergo callus formation and aging of these fractures is unreliable Differential Diagnosis Accidental fractures Obstetrical trauma Prematurity NutTitional deficiencies such as rickets Metabolic disorders such as Nenke's syndrome Drug toxicity making the bones fragile Neuromuscular disorders such as cerebral palsy (CP) Differential Diagnosis (con't) Skeletal dysplasias such as osteogenesis imperfecta. (A new entity has been described by Paterson that he has called 'Temporary Brittle Bone Disease\" for which there is no scientific evidence. It Is often used in the courts as a defense ploy in cases of abusive multiple fractures.) Neoplasms such as leukemla Specificity of Fractures for Abuse When to suspect abuse: Metaphyseal fractures in children under 2 years of age Posterior rib fractures Medial or lateral clavicular fractures Scapular fractures Spine fractures Sternum fractures Specificity of Fractures for Abuse Highly suspicious for abuse: Multiple fractures, espedally bilateral fractures (fractures of long bones on both sides) Repetitive fractures in the same child Fractures to the hands or feet Specificity of Fractures for Abuse Histories suspicious for abuse: Delay in seeking medical attention Discrepant history - the history does not make sense when assessing the injury Fractures in varying stages of healing Extremity plus skull fracture IntTacranial injuries plus skull fracture Any fracture in a child under 2 years of age should be investigated for the possibility of abuse Neglect The failure to meet the child's need in terms of food, clothing, shelter, medical care, safekeeping, nurturance and education. Neglect accounts for nearly half of all reports and half of all child fatalities due to child maltreatment. Physical Neglect Exposure Failure to provide food, shelter and/or clothing appropriate to the weather are examples of this form of neglect. Failure to Thrive \"Failure to thrive due to the withholding of food is the most extreme form of physical neglect Child's growth deviates from the norms of the child's age and sex due to malnutrition Most common risk factors are poverty and substance abuse Abusive failure to thrive must be distinguished from other forms of FI-F where there are social or medical factors contributing to or responsible for the FFT Unusual dietary habits due to parental practices based on fad diets, ignorance, or splinter religious or cultural groups Medical Neglect Immunization failures or lapses are one form of this type of neglect and rarely can be implicated as a cause of child fatality. Instances where this might occur are cases of tetanus (lockjaw), poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, hepatitis, or diphtheria leading to death. Medical Neglect (con't) Non-compliance with medical advice is a more common cause for child fatality due to medical neglect. In cases of life-threatening illnesses such as diabetes, cancer, asthma or cystic fibrosis, or to infectious diseases such as meningitis or sepis, or refusal of life-saving surgical procedures, failure to follow established and accepted proven medical treatments leading to a child's death are considered examples of medical neglect. Medical Neglect (con't) Certain religious practices are responsible for child fatalities. There are well-documented cases of deaths in the Christian Science Church because of refusal of usual medical care. There are at least 17 religious sects where deaths have occurred because of bizarre beliefs in healing by falth. Examples of these churches include the Faith Assembly, End Time Ministries and Faith Tabernacle Church. Medical Neglect (con't) Cultural practices are responsible for directly produdng child fatalities as well as delaying or refusal of accepted medical practices for a vadety of illnesses and conditions leading to death. These practices indude coin rubbing, moxibustion, female genital mutilation, caida de mollera and cupping. Supervisory Neglect House fires are responsible for a significant number of child fatalities. Some of these are due to caretakers who have left their children alone in a dwelling and the house catches fire due to the children playing with matches, dgarette lighters or appliances. Supervisory Neglect (con't) Bathtub and bucket drownings cause child deaths on a regular basis. A child left unsupervised in a bathtub while the caretaker leaves to answer the phone, attend to some other activity or simply due to ignorance or laziness may drown. A certain percentage of these bathtub drownings are intentional. Supervisory Neglect (con't) Dangerous baby equipment has led to deaths. The U.S. Consumer Safety Commission has ascertained at least one death per year due to infant walkers. Walkers are implicated by some caretakers when the real injuries are due to physical abuse and the walker is used as an excuse for the injuries. Supervisory Neglect (con't) Automobile seat restraints. The failure to secure infants and children in proper seat restraints has resulted in child fatalities. Supervisory Neglect (con't) Exposure to drugs and drug environments. There are numerous reports of passive drug exposures being responsible for child injuries and some fatalities. Some caretakers have administered drugs to children for a variety of masons, including a desire to keep the child quiet, to put them to sleep, or from a perverted desire to give the child the same pleasure they are enjoying. Living in a drug environment has also led to child deaths by exposing the child to the dangers of the paraphernalia of drug abuse (caustic ingestions of free basing agents) and the dangers of drug dealers. Munchausen by Proxy (MBP) HBP is a cluster of symptoms and/or signs where: An illness in a child is faked and/or produced by a parent The child is presented for medical assessment and care, usually persistently, often resulting in multiple medical procedures Knowledge about the etiology of the child's illness is denied by the perpetrator, and Acute symptoms and signs in the child abate when the child is removed from the perpetrator Manifestations The most common manifestations are: Apnea (cessation of breathing) Seizures Recurrent vomiting Recurrent diarrhea Muscular weakness Neurological problems Bleeding disorders Complaints of sexual abuse Manifestations Because of the need on the part of the perpetrator to keep the child ill, the perpetrator, usually the child's mother, will escalate the illness simulation or production to keep the medical providers' attention. In some cases, the perpetrator will go too far, causing the child's death. Poisonings The administration of toxic agents to a child has been responsible for child fatalities. The exact number of such events is unknown since no records are kept in a uniform fashion across the United States. When this is suspected, and the offending agent is known, tests can be run to confirm their presence. When the agent is unknown, toxicology screens may determine the agent is in the blood or urine. However, most screens miss a large number of toxic drugs due to the large number of new drugs constantly being manufactured either legally or illegally. Suffocation It is difficult to determine how many child fatalities are due to intentional suffocation since postmortem examinations cannot, in most instances, identify the mechanism of hypoxic damage to the brain. The pathologist can determine whether or not hypoxia has occurred but cannot be certain as to how it came to be. Strangulation Strangulation injuries can lead to hypoxia and death. External evidence is often present, but many strangulation deaths are said by caretakers to be due to window shade pulls, cords in or around cribs or playpens, or garments. It there are clear indications of manual strangulation, such as finger marks around the neck, the cause is more identifiable. Close cooperation with the pathologlst doing the postmortem investigation should lead to more clearly delineated causes.

Objectivity - Non-judgmental No editorial comments Photodocumentation when possible The Autopsy and the Pathologist's Perspective Relationships between health care professionals, emergency medical technicians, law enforcement and prosecution Concept of a multi-disciplinary team Legal constraints of confidentiality Participation on child death review teams Serving as expert witness The key points in the anatomy of the head consist of the following layers: Scalp (Hair, skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle) Subgaleal space (under the scalp) Skull (cranial bones) In the infant and young child the skull consists of a group of bones joined by sutures lines of a cartilaginous nature. The anterior fontanelle (soft. spot) is formed by the non-union of bones on the top of the head where the bones have not joined together as yet. Epidurai space. This is a potential space lying just beneath the skull and just above the dura mater, Dura mater. This is the outer membrane lying over the brain. It has large veins (dural sinuses) and small veins coursing through its substance. A large front-to-back sinus, the superior sagittal sinus, collects venous blood and ultimately returns it to the heart. Subdural space. This is the potential space just below the dura mater. Bridging veins. These multiple small veins carry blood from the surface of the brain through the subarachnoid space and the subdural space to the collection system of sinuses within the dura mater. Pia-arachnoid. This web-like membrane (hence the name arachnoid) enshrouds the curvatures of the brain (the sulci and gyri) and contains the cerebrospinal fluid. Parenchyma. This is the brain substance itself. Axons and Dendrites. Each nerve cell (neuron) has a number of dendrites, which lead impulses to the cell, and one axon, leading impulses from the cell. Myelin. This is the \"insulation\" of the nervous system and is not fully developed until about age 18 months. Because of the infant's under-developed myelin, and because the infant's brain contains 25% more water, its brain is much softer than the adult brain.. Brainstem. This is the collection of nerve tracts and other central nervous system components leading from the brain to the spinal cord. Ventricles. A system of \"aqueducts\" within the brain which secrete, store and circulate cerebrospinal fluid. Shaken baby syndrome/shaken impact syndrome (SBS/SIS) The terms shaken baby syndrome (SBS) and shaken impact syndrome (SIS) refer to the signs and symptoms, as well as the clinical, radiographic and sometimes autopsy findings resulting from violent shaking of an infant or young child. SBS/SIS are often used interchangeably and are synonymous with other descriptive terms used in the earlier scientific literature such as whiplash shaken infant syndrome and shake/slam syndrome. There are no firm statistics regarding the actual incidence of SBS/SIS since there are no central reporting registries to collect these data. However, estimates have been made based on clinical experience and extrapolated figures from hospitals caring for children. Estimates range from annual figures as low as 600 cases per year in the United States to as high as 1400. It is known that it is the most common cause of mortality from physical abuse and accounts for the most long term disability in infants and young children due to physical abuse. The age of the victims ranges from the newborn period to approximately 4 years of age. The majority of cases occur before the infants' first birthday and the average age of the victim is between 3 and 8 months of age. The usual trigger for shaking is inconsolable crying by the infant. Frustrated by attempts to console the baby, the perpetrator loses control and grabs the infant, either by the thorax, the upper arms or the neck, and violently shakes the baby. The time of the shaking varies, usually ranging from 5 seconds to 15 or 20 seconds. During the shaking, the head rotates wildly on the axis of the neck creating multiple forces within the head. The infant stops crying and stops breathing, causing decreased oxygen supply to the body, particularly to the brain. The infant brain, having a much higher water content than the adult brain, is much softer than the adult brain. The absence of myelination, the \"insulation\" of the nerve cells acquired during development of the nervous system, contributes to the relative softness of the brain. These factors make the brain more gelatinous and during shaking is more easily distorted and compressed within the skull. Shaking and the sudden deceleration of the head at the time of impact do several things: 1. The veins that bridge from the brain to the dura, which is fixed to the inside of the skull, are stretched and, exceeding their elasticity, tear open and bleed, creating the subdural hematoma. 2. The brain strikes the inner surface of the skull, causing direct trauma to the brain substance. 3. The deeper structures of the brain, the axons, can be broken, shearing off du.ring the commotion to the brain. 4. The lack of oxygen during shaking causes further irreversible damage to the brain substance. 5. Damaged nerve cells release chemicals which add to the oxygen deprivation and cause further damage to adjacent nerve cells. The combined effect is massive traumatic destruction of the brain tissue, leading to immediate brain swelling and causing enormous increases in the pressure within the skull. The swelling compounds the problem, since swelling causes compression of blood vessels and decreases the oxygen supply to the brain. IT IS THESE INJURIES TO THE BRAIN, NOT THE BLEEDING UNDER THE DURA OR ARACHNOID MEMBRANES, THAT CAUSE THE SIGNS, SYMPTOMS AND COURSE OF SHAKEN BABY/SHAKEN IMPACT SYNDROME. Concomitant with the destruction of brain tissue are other injuries. The most significant of these are the retinal hemorrhages. These are variable but are usually multiple and involve several layers of the retina. Skull fractures may be seen when there has been sufficient impact. Posterior rib fractures may be seen reflecting the compression of the chest during shaking and the movement of the rib cage past the horizontal plan of the back, levering the ribs against the transverse processes of the vertebral bodies. Bruising of the skin of the head, face and other parts of the body may be seen, but are not invariable. It is uncommon to see injuries to the neck or spinal column or of the spinal cord. Symptoms and physical findings are variable, depending on the length and severity of the shaking and whether or not the infant was thrown onto a surface. The syndrome can be seen as a continuum from a short duration of shaking with little or no impact to severe shaking with major impact. The resulting signs and symptoms may run the gamut from decreased responsiveness, irritability,lethargy and limpness - through convulsions, vomiting from increased intracranial pressure, increased breathing rate, low body temperature and low heart rate - to coma with fixed and dilate pupils - to death. Module 3 Accidents and Abuse: How to Tell the Difference Accidents and Abuse: How to Tell the Difference Abstract Definitions of an accident and abuse axe discussed along with questions to be asked to separate the accidental from the inflicted injury. The importance of the basic approach in history taking, thorough physical examinations and the judicious use of ancillary services of radiology and laboratory are emphasized. Common suspicious stories offered to explain injuries and the pitfalls the clinician should avoid are discussed. An approach to understanding how an injury could happen is provided, using elements of the injury such as location, pattern and history. These facts are then viewed in the context of the known studies on similar injuries to specific organ systems and a determination made as to the likelihood of the injury being accidental or abusive in origin. Learning Objectives To differentiate accidents from inflicted injuries To learn those questions which help to separate the accidental from inflicted injury To learn the elements of the history, physical examination, and ancillary testing which bear upon the diagnosis of inflicted injury To understand the principles of the biomechanics of injury as they relate to inflicted injuries To be aware of suspicious stories in fatal child abuse cases, and the costly errors in the diagnostic process Module 3 Accidents and Abuse: How to Tell the Difference Outline \u00b0 2. 3. . 5. 6. . . .

It is An intentional event or action is one that occurs voluntarily and assumes conscious - or perhaps even unconscious - control, reflecting an underlying conflict or impulse. There is a continuum in possible child abuse cases from what appears to be a volitional act to what appears to be a chance event. The decision as to which it is must be made taking into account: the setting of the event -- social context, location of encounter the biases of the observer and reporter the type of injury_ - the likelihood of the observed injuries being the result of an accident the future risk to the child Questions to ask to help separate the accidental from the inflicted injury 1. What is the age of the patient? Developmental stages determine what kinds of injuries are likely to be seen. What can they do? What are they likely to be doing? Is the child described as hyperactive, daredevil, combative, obstreperous? Does the child have a high \"annoyance potential\" and more likely to be disciplined harshly? 2. Is the history plausible? 3. Does the history change with changing information supplied to the caretaker? 4. Does the history change when related in subsequent accounts by other family members or by the original historian? 5. Are there non - familial eye - witnesses to the event? 6.

Location Subgaleal hematoma - tearing of veins by traction Epidural hematoma - usually due to fall on sharp object leading to skull fracture impinging on middle cerebral artery or its branches Subdural / subaraclmoid bleeding - due to severe head trauma Intracerebral injury - can be penetrating injury or due to severe trauma Bilateral blackeyes - severe direct trauma to eyes or racoon eyes resulting from diffusion of blood from basilar skull fracture or subgaleal hematoma. 2. Pattern In absence of external evidence, probably due to SBS/Shaken Impact Syndrome With external trauma, could be due to direct blow or to Shaken Impact Syndrome Evidence of blunt or sharp trauma from an identified or unidentified weapon Association with retinal hemorrhages, skeletal injuries Module 3 Accidents and Abuse: How to Tell the Difference 3. Incidence studies More mortality and morbidity from head injuries than from any other form of physical child abuse In inflicted injury deaths, intracranial injury is found in 60 % Seventy percent of children with abusive head injury have skeletal injuries Retinal hemorrhages present in over 90% of SBS / SIS Cutaneous bruising in 1/3 of cases 4.

Incidence studies Eleven percent of visceral injuries in children under 13 are inflicted Visceral injuries from abuse occur in younger children, had poor histories, delayed medical treatment in abused children, and the inflicted injuries occured to hollow viscera more often than to solid organs. Mortality rates in inflicted versus accidental visceral injuries were 53 % versus 21% . History Most often discrepant in inflicted injuries (attributed to falls, or unwitnessed) and opposed to accidental where most injuries were due to motor vehicle accidents. I1 Module 3 Accidents and Abuse: How to Tell the Difference D. Skeletal Injuries 1. Location Skull - Inflicted injury fractures are more often complex, cross suture lines, are depressed, or are diastatic. o Extremities - In children under 2, the most common inflicted fractures are in the femur, the humerus, the tibia and the ribs. Ribs - Posterior rib fractures are highly specific for child abuse Metaphyseal fractures are highly specific for child abuse 2. Pattern Very little can be discerned from the type of fracture - eg, spixal fractures are no more specific for abuse than are transverse fractures As noted above, the more severe the type of skull fracture, the more likely it is to be due to child abuse 3. Incidence studies The reported frequency of fractures associated with child abuse ranges from 11% - 55% 43 % of skeletal injuries are unsuspected clinically Up to 70 % of inflicted fractures occur in children under the age of one year 80% of abuse fractures are found in infants less than 18 months of age 2 % of accidental fractures are found in children under 18 months of age 4. The history is of paramount importance in deciding whether the proffered mechanism of injury could have caused the injury. ? 12 Module 3 Accidents and Abuse: How to Tell the Difference Svecificitv of Radioloaic Findin2s specificity: Metaphyseal Spinous process fractures Sternal fractures Moderate specificity: Multiple fractures, especially bilateral Fractures of different ages Epiphyseal separations Vertebral body fractures and subluxations Digital fractures Complex skull fractures Common, but low specificity: Clavicular fractures Long bone shaft fractures Linear skull fractures *Moderate and low specificity lesion become high when history of trauma is absent or inconsistent with injuries. From Kkeinman PK: Diagnostic Imaging in child abuse. Baltimore, Williams and Wilkins, 1987. 13 Module 3 Accidents and Abuse: How to Tell the Difference History of the Circumstances of Injury Injuries in Children Resulting from Falls: Falls from Heights less than 36 inches A. Heifer et al (1977) Children under 5 years of age 176 incidents (reported by questionnaire) 37 insignificant injuries 6 injuries -3 fractured clavicles, 2 skull fractures, one fractured humerus None of the 161 children suffered any serious life threatening injuries 85 incidents in hospital 57-no injury 17-small cuts, abrasions, and/or bloody noses 20-bump and / or bruise 1- skull fracture with no serious sequelae B. Nimityongskul et al (1987) * 76 children- in hospital, injuries minor Conclusion from both studies: CA should be suspected when the cause of a serious head injury is said to be a fall from a short height ( < 36\") 14 Module 3 Accidents and Abuse: How to Tell the Difference C. Barlow et al (1983) 61 children: half 4 years or less 100% survival < 3 stories 14 died: half from falls 5-6 ~ floors * 11 \"Severe brain injury\" <) 1 SDH ~) 11 Concusion * 3 Visceral injury D. Williams et al (1991) 106 non - caretaker witnessed falls 15 - no injuries (7 falls > 10 feet) 77 - bruises, abrasions, simple fractures (43 falls > 10 feet) 14 - intensive care injuries (falls 5 - 40 feet) 1 - fatality (fall 70 feet) No life - threratening injuries in 3 falling < 3 feet. E. Musemeche (1991) 70 children falling > 10 feet (mean 2 stories) 50 % 3 years and younger no correlation between height and injuries no fatalities 39 head trauma 2 SDH 3 EDH 15 Module 3 Accidents and Abuse: How to Tell the Difference F. Smith, et al (1975) 66 children (4 months - 15 years) injured in falls 50 % of cases were falls 12 feet or less 50% of cases were < 5 years, peak incidence 2 years Injuries: 2 SDH (age & height of fall not specified) 10 Skull fracture (7 in falls > 36 inches) 26 UE fracture 10 LE fracture 0 rib fracture or cervical spine 0 retinal hemorrhages described G. Chadwick, et al (1991) At In'st glance the study by Chadwick et al would seem to contradict the earlier findings that no serious injuries occurred as the result of falling short distances. Purpose: To determine the relationship of historical fall height to mortality and to assess the reliability of historical fall height. 317 cases- * 100 where the fall was historically < 4 feet. o 7 died in falls under 4 feet-all from head injury 2 from standing fall 2 from bed or table 1 fall down stairs-unwitnessed 2 fall from arms of adult 81% were treated and released from the ED In the stairway fall, the child also had massive head injury, small round bruises on both arms, bruising of the labia majora and one on the inner thigh. 16 Module 3 Accidents and Abuse: How to Tell the Difference In the other six cases the histories were so discrepant for the degree of head injury and other findings of multiple injuries that the diagnosis of child abuse was inescapable. Bunk Bed Falls Selbst and colleagues studied bunk bed injuries in 1990. 68 children fell from bunk beds-upper bunks 71% happened during the day Injuries Locations: Head-52 % Lower % Eye-4% Buttocks-3 % Trunk-2 % Multiple injuries-9% No child suffered neck, genital, internal injuries Stairway Falls Joffe and Ludwig: 363 falls downstairs-ages 1 month to 18.7 years- median 38m No injury-10% Minor injury-80% Major soft tissue, concussion, fractures-13 % No life threatening injuries or multiple injuries Injuries in the younger age group were almost all head 17 Module 3 Accidents and Abuse: How to Tell the Difference Mechanism of Injury Falls on stairs are comprised of one major fall, usually less than 4 feet and a series of minor falls as the child tumbles down the stairs. Motor Vehicle Accidents (MVA) In motor vehicle accidents, the history is usually reliable since emergency medical personnel are usually involved along with police. There are several circumstances, however, where child maltreatment should be considered even in MVA's: 1) Where the child is brought to the E.R. with the caretaker's claim that the observed injuries are due to an MVA, but there is no police or EMS corroboration or witness. 2) Where the MVA is because of reckless behavior or drug/alcohol related accident. 3) Where a child restraint (car seat) was not used. Playground Equipment Multiple injuries from playground equipment are reported annually. The same principles apply to injuries claimed to be caused by playground equipment as to other injuries - plausibility of the injuries being consistent with the history, and the literature on injuries from playground equipment. 18 Module 3 Accidents and Abuse: How to Tell the Difference Walker Injuries 29,000 walker / jumper injuries seen in United States ER's in 1991 US Consumer Product Safety Commission - 1 death annually Medical Studies on Walker Injuries 82 -K 47 NR ....................... ~ ................................... . ............................. 82 -F 1 84 -W 38 0 0 0 84 -S 52 (Q) 0 i 3 0 86-R 139 93 i19 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ......................................................................................... ~ ................................... ~. ................................................... ~ 91-P 19 10 i9 0 0 Walker Injuries 1980 - 1991 us Product Safety Commission Head injuries in US Annually (average) = 8541 injury types: concussion contusions fractures hematoma (unspecified) 19 Module 3 Accidents and Abuse: How to Tell the Difference Death Certificate Information us Product safety commission SAH due to \"jumping up and down in walker\"- autopsy \" Asphyxiation - no autopsy Anoxic encephalopatlay - autopsy Walker rolled down driveway, overturned - autopsy Fell - stumbled over walker - hip fracture - no autopsy Encephalopathy - suffocation, accidental - no autopsy 50% autopsy rate Walker Injury Deaths - 1980 - 1991 us Product Safety Commission 13 deaths in 12 years 5 asphyxiation / suffocation / strangulation 4 drowned (3 toilet, 1 swimming pool) 3 \"falls\" while in walker 1 infant died while in walker - possible SIDS Message: better death investigation 20 Module 3 Accidents and Abuse: How to Tell the Difference The Biomechanics of Injury A. Skeletal Lesions Long bone fractures Femoral Fractures Beals and Tufts analyzed 80 femoral fractures in children under 4 years: Violent accidental trauma: 8.5 % Pathologic fractures: 12.5% Child abuse: 30% Less violent accidental trauma: 50% Anderson studied 117 children with 122 femoral fractures: 18 children under 13 months- 83 % abused 24 children under 24 months- 79 % Older children- accidental fractures predominated Gross and Dalton's studies show roughly the same proportions Dalton et al looked at the femoral fractures in 3 Michigan hospitals: 138 children under 3 years of age with femoral fractures Accidents- 22 % Pathologic- 8 % Abuse- 10% Uncertain- 60% After social service involvement in 36 cases, 22 were changed from uncertain to abuse so that the total after investigation was 36 representing 26 % of the total. Post hospital information added another 7 to the total, making the figure 31%. NO significant correlation could be found between the type of fracture (spiral, transverse, etc.) and the subgroup of causation. Children under 1 year of age were over represented in the abuse category. 21 Module 3 Accidents and Abuse: How to Tell the Difference Thomas et al (1991) Reported in a study involving 39 children under the age of 3 years with either humeral or femoral fractures, that: 20 of 39 were of inflicted origin In 11 of 14 humeral fractures, abuse was the cause with the other 3 being supracondylor, resulting from falls on elbow 9 of 25 fractures of the femur were abusive in origin 60 % of fractures of the femur in children under 1 year of age were inflicted Toddler Fractures Definition: A spiral or oblique undisplaced mid or distal tibial fracture with an intact fibula in a child from 9 months to 3 years of age. These are usually seen in children who are able to walk and may result from trivial or unwitnessed injuries. The child will refuse to bear weight on the affected leg, or will limp on that limb. Radiographs of the lower extremity may show an oblique fracture in the lower half of the tibia. In a recent study by Skravat et al, (1996) a review of 21 cases showed the following: Presenting symptom was \"unable to bear weight\" in 20/21 In 15 of 21, the initial diagnosis was either definite or suspected toddler fracture In 6 of 21, the initial radiograph failed to demonstrate the fracture 22 Module 3 Accidents and Abuse: How to Tell the Difference r Rib fractures 5-27 % of fractures in abused children Most rib fractures in infants and children are abusive in origin Rib fractures only very rarely result from CPR In the absence of intrinsic bone disease or major trauma, rib fractures are specific for abuse Mechanism of production is compression of the thoracic cage. Most abusive rib fractures are posterior Fractures are ventral, excluding direct dorsal blows Posterior rib fractures result from AP compression of the thorax thought to be the result of using the thorax as the \"handle\" during violent shaking or other battering Metaphyseal fractures For years, since Caffey's original description of these lesions, the classic bone abnormality said to be diagnostic in child abuse, has been the metaphyseal fracturen known as corner fractures or metaphyseal flags, metaphyseal infractions, avulsion fractures, bucket handle fractures or metaphyseal fragmentation. Recently, Kleinman has offered a new explanation for these lesions. It is based on the histologic study of the distal metaphysis. The fundamental histologic lesion is one of microfracmres through the most immature portion of the metaphyseal primary spongiosa. The fracture plane is a disc-like bony fragment that, depending on the projection of the x-ray beam, appears as isolated comer fragments, or as bucket handle images. In the combined studies of Heifer and Nimityongshd where 337 children were studied, the conclusions were that falling from a height of 36 inches causes no serious injuries; CA should be suspected in a child with a serious head injury when the cause of injury is reported to be a fall from a bed, sofa or crib. 23 Module 3 Accidents and Abuse: How to Tell the Difference Visceral Injuries Ledbetter and colleagues reported on the diagnostic and surgical implications of child abuse: 156 children < 13 years of age with blunt abdominal trauma 139 accidental-89% 17abuse-ll% In comparing the accidental group to the abuse group, he found: ........ .- IM~I ................ i Median Age 7 years, 8 months History Usually MVA Medical care Prompt ......................................................................................................................

The first domain- a strictly medical one- requires a medical or surgical diagnosis followed by a management strategy. The second domain requires a decision as to whether the observed phenomenon is due to inflicted injury, a medical disease process or an unintentional injury. Traditional medical and surgical approaches are the central concerns in the first domain and optimal management is required to obtain the best short term outcome here. Within the second domain lies the challenge of securing the best comprehensive outcome for the child and family and requires the skills and wisdom of the interdisciplinary team both at the hospital and the community levels. Learning Objectives To list the incidence and prevalence of child maltreatment. To differentiate unintentional injuries from abuse To describe abusive head injuries, using laboratory and imaging studies To describe skeletal injuries, including elements of the skeletal survey To describe cutaneous injuries, including bruising and burns To define non-accidental poisoning To diagnose Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse Outline I\u00b0 1I.

Clinical Indicators of Abuse by Poisoning (Table VII) Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse Incidence and Prevalence of Physical Child Abuse in 1994, it was estimated that 3.4 million children were reported to public social service agencies for abuse and/or neglect. This represents a 132 % increase over the last decade. Approximately 1200-2000 children die from child abuse annually. In 1990, 27% Of the reports were for physical abuse, 46% for neglect, 15% for sexual abuse, 9% for emotional maltreatment, and 4 % for other forms of maltreatment. Reports from daycare or foster care represented less that 1% of the total reports. The definition of physical abuse in Public Law 93-247 is as \"The physical or mental injury, sexual abuse, negligent treatment, or maltreatment of a child under the age of eighteen by a person who is responsible for the child's welfare under circumstances which indicate the child's health or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby.\" Neglect occurs when a caretaker responsible for a child either deliberately or by extraordinary inattentiveness permits a child to suffer or fails to provide one or more of the conditions generally deemed essential for developing a person's physical, intellectual or emotional capacities. A child is physically neglected when his/her needs for food, shelter or clothing are omitted; emotionally neglected when he/she is denied nurturing qualities necessary for sound personality development; medically neglected when usual and locally accepted minimum levels of preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic medical services are not provided by parents or guardians; and educationally neglected when a caretaker fails to insure education as provided by state law. Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse Accidents or Abuse? An accident is defined as an event that occurs incidentally, casually or by chance. It is presumed that such an event was at least consciously unintentional and that if such circumstances are under conscious control an attempt would have been made to avert the anticipated future course of events. An intentional event or action is one that occurs voluntarily and assumes conscious - or perhaps even unconscious- control, reflecting an underlying conflict or impulse. In possible child abuse cases there is a continuum from what appears to be a volitional act to what appears to be a chance event. The dec:-\" as to which it is must be made taking into account the setting of the event (social context, location of encounter), the biases of the observer and the reporter, the type of injury (likelihood of observed injury(ies) being due to an accidental mechanism ), and the future risk to the child if that is at all predictable. The approach, however, both to the medical or surgical diagnosis and to the determination of the etiology of the observed condition, is a traditional medical one: accurate and comprehensive historical investigation, thorough physical examination, discerning selection of laboratory and imaging modalities to establish the extent and complexity of the disease state and how it came to be. Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse Questions which will help separate the accidental from the inflicted injury: I. What is the age of the patient ? Developmental stages of childhood determine what kinds of injuries are likely to be seen. The motor skills of the child determine what the child could have done to incur injury. What can they do at a particular stage of development? What are they likely to be doing? What are the normal behaviors of a child at particular ages? Is the child \"hyperactive\" either in the eyes of his/her caretakers or in actual fact? Is the child a \"daredevil\"? Is the child obstreperous, combative or possessive of a \"high annoyance potential\" and therefore more likely to be disciplined harshly? 2. Is the history plausible? Could this injury have been sustained in the manner described? 3. Does the history change with changing information supplied to the caretaker ? Adjustments in the account of the injury may be made by caretakers to fit the evolving information indicating the tailoring of the history to fit the new information. 4. Does the history change when related in subsequent accounts by other family members ? 5. Are there non-familial eyewitnesses to the injury? 6. Was the injury not witnessed by the caretaker? The lack of information as to how a serious injury has occurred should raise the index of suspicion for an abusive origin. 7. Is the demeanor of the caretakers defensive, belligerent, hostile, or passive and not in keeping with the seriousness of the patient's condition ? 8. Is the social situation in which the injury occurred a high risk environment? The presence of community or intrafamilial violence, substance abuse, chaotic living arrangements, poverty, social isolation, transient life styles, mental health aberrations, or discord amongst family members are red flags. Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse 9. Can the described mechanism of injury account for the observed injury? The concept of the discrepant history is a central one in distinguishing between accidental and inflicted inSury. Often the injury is explained by claiming that a fall has caused the injury. A large literature has emerged that discounts falls from short distances being responsible for serious injuries, but short falls- downstairs, off beds, couches, tables, in baby walkers, and even out of first story windows or porches- are often cited as the mechanisms of injury for serious injuries in abuse cases. The role of torsion must be considered in fractured bones, and it should be remembered that for a torsion injury to exist, one end of a long bone must be fixed and tremendous torsional force be applied to the long axis of the bone to cause such injuries. The issue of how much force is required to produce injuries must be addressed and a conclusion reached on the basis of information derived from the literature on trauma victims. 10. -What else could produce the clinical picture? The differential diagnosis must be explored to consider both medical conditions that could produce the observed injury or condition and appropriate testing be carded out to exclude non-accidental causes of the injury. (See below) Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse Head Injuries More fatalities and long term morbidity are due to abusive head injury than from any other form of physical abuse. The types of abusive head injuries range from asymptomatic swelling through mild to moderate bruising, skull fracture, to intracranial bleeding and diffuse axonal shearing injury and brain swelling resulting in stupor, coma and death. When a child under 3 years of age comes for medical care with a serious head injury without a readily apparent major trauma history (motor vehicle accident, fall from heights over 10 feet), the chances of this being an inflicted injury are quite high. Data Collection While a seriously head-injured child is being evaluated and treated medically, it is crucial for a detailed, analytical- but not challenging or accusatory- history to be obtained from the caretakers. The person collecting the history should ideally be someone with experience in child abuse cases and one who does not have immediate responsibility for the medical treatment required by the child. It is the rule that abusing parents will tell a misleading story about how the \"accident\" happened and are sometimes quite inventive in describing the event. Thus, the skill of interviewing becomes an important foundation on which to build the diagnostic formulation. Gentle probing, with inquiries and request for clarification on questionable portions of the history- sometimes called \"the Columbo approach\", often will elucidate the mechanism of injury and show discrepancies in the history. The history of the pregnancy, labor and delivery, neonatal course, as well a~ a history of family diseases is important, with particular attention to bleeding and clotting disorders, neurological diseases, metabolic and bone disease, or other genetic conditions of the family. This comprehensive evaluation will save returning to the caretakers for missing data as the Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse case ages. The past medical history of the child, including previous injuries and serious illnesses or hospitalizations, along with a review of systems should be obtained. Exploration of the social milieu with attention to the living arrangements and the relationships of household members should be done. The physical examination of the child with a head injury runs the risk of ignoring less urgently compromised organ systems. Bleeding visceral organs are the most glaring and potentially disastrous omissions, but overlooking cutaneous injuries can deprive the diagnostician of important clinical data because of the fleeting nature of these injuries. Likewise, inspection of the oral cavity looking for intraoral lesions is important as is a search for hidden head lesions under the hair. The neck should be carefully inspected for signs of injury (strangulation, hand or finger bruising). T'- : \".sence of bruises on the back, thighs, or in the perineum should also be noted. Photodocumentation of such injuries is highly desirable. The examination of the fundi is of utmost importa.nce. This should be carried out ideally by pupillary dilation and indirect ophthalmoscopic inspection, but in lieu of that capability, by direct opthalmoscopy. Although retinal hemorrhages are the most common finding in child abuse, other lesions may also be seen. These include retinal detachment, optic nerve injury and cupping of the optic nerve secondary to raised intracranial pressure. Although retinal hemorrhages are not pathognomonic of inflicted head trauma, they are present in a high percentage of abuse cases and not present in most accidental head trauma, and are seldom seen in children who had undergone cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse Laboratory Studies Children with head trauma severe enough to be admitted to the hospital should also have laboratory studies to support diagnoses of associated trauma in other organ systems, to anticipate hematologic and biochemical alterations sometimes attendant to head trauma, and also to seek for the manifestations of their neurological status. These studies are displayed in Table I Table I CBC with morphology, serial urine, cerebrospinal (if safe to perform lumbar puncture) PT, PTT, platelet count Stool for blood Arterial blood gases Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse Imaging Studies In most instances of moderate to severe head injury, the first imaging modality should be Computerized Tomography (CT) scanning without contrast since it is readily available in most hospitals and can be performed safely with life support systems operating during the procedure. Bone windows should be employed along with the standard scan. Plain radiographs of the skull will usually show existing skull fractures better than CT. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is Ordinarily used as a confirmatory test rather than an initial one due to the longer scan times and need for life support, but MRI gives superior detail in showing parenchymal changes and smaller subdural hemotomata. CT scans of the abdominal viscera are valuable when liver function studies show elevation of the transaminases and/or there is reason to believe hepatic damage is present. Likewise, if splenic or renal tearing is suspected, CT will delineate these injuries (See Abdominal Trauma, below). Skeletal surveys are recommended in serious head trauma since the diagnosis of abuse may be made or supported if unsuspected or occult traumatic injuries are found in other parts of the appendicular skeleton. Such accompanying skeletal fractures are seen in roughly half of the cases of abusive head injury. Posterior rib fractures are present in some cases of shaken infants and can be demonstrated either with bone scintigraphy for fresh fractures or with follow-up thoracic films in 10- 14 days to see callus formation at the site of these fractures. The types of injuries in serious abusive head injury include skull fractures (see below, Skeletal injuries), subdural or subarachnoid bleeding, cerebral edema, diffuse axonal shearing injuries, parenchymal tears and contusions, and injuries to the cervical spinal cord. The shaken baby syndrome (shaken-impact syndrome) occurs in babies, usually under one year of age but described in children as old as 2 years of age, and consists of violent shaking and/or shaking plus impact. Recent data have supported the concept that shaking and impact by throwing the child against a surface and resultant deceleration are 10 Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse the responsible forces producing the subdural hematoma, diffuse axonal sheafing and consequent cerebral edema leading to raised intracranial pressure. Whether shaking alone or shaking plus impact are required to cause the damage is being debated, but the clinical picture is one of neurological devastation resulting in death in 27 % and long term neurological morbidity in the majority (57-65 %) of the survivors. Abdominal and Thoracic Injuries The second most common cause of fatality in child physical abuse, abdominal and thoracic injuries account for between 6 and 8 percent of all physical abuse. The vast majority of these are abdominal injuries. Reported fatality rates, however, are between 40 and 50 percent of these cases. Features that distinguish accidental abdominal injuries from abusive ones were reported by Ledbetter. He found that abusive abdominal injuries: 1. were more common in younger children (median age 2.0 versus 7.8 years in accidental) 2. had vague histories accounting for the abusive abdominal injuries while 70 % of the injuries in the accidental group were due to motor vehicle accidents and 20 % to falls from great heights. 3. had delayed medical care in contrast to the accidental group where there was prompt care. 4. involved injuries to hollow viscera most often whereas a solid organ was more often injured in the accidental group. 5. had a higher mortality rate (53 %) as compared to 21% in the accident cases. 11 Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse There is a hierarchy of injury to the abdominal organs, with hollow viscera being the most common. Ninety percent of these are in the duodenum or jejunum and the remainder are in the terminal ileum. The second most common organ for abusive injury is the liver, particularly the more midline portion, and the thL-d most common is the pancreas. The signs and symptoms of abdominal injury can be quite striking, with distention, exquisite tenderness, vomiting, shock or unconsciousness. Most children with abdominal injuries, either inflicted or accidental, have no obvious abdominal wall injuries. Some children have only minimal signs and symptoms, or there are injuries to other parts of the body making attention to the abdomen less of a priority. Rapid deterioration can occur if blood loss is not identified and treated. Laboratory Studies (See Table I) Imaging Studies The preferred initial study to diagnose abdominal or thoracic injury is the plain radiograph. Two frontal views of the abdomen, one supine and one erect, are recommended. If the child is too ill to obtain an erect view, a horizontal beam cross table lateral can be used. If obstruction, perforation, pneumoperitoneum, hemoperitoneum, or ascites are present, this technique will usually identify them. If there is obstruction, contrast media can be used to localize the lesion. Barium is the preferred contrast medium unless perforation is suspected in which case a water-soluble contrast medium should be used. A frontal view of the chest is recommended for possible thoracic injuries, including rib fractures. A skeletal survey should also be obtained at the earliest possible opportunity, especially in severely injured children, since future opportunities may not occur and important forensic evidence may be lost. Obviously, the clinical condition of the child must determine the performance of the studies. 12 Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse Contrast studies for the genitourinary tract are rarely indicated since the advent of CT scanning, but a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) may be needed if lower urinary tract ruptures need delineation. The CT scan is the most useful imaging technique for evaluation of solid organ injuries by demonstrating alteration in the architecture of these organs. Contrast studies are better for showing hollow organ lesions and the CT depends in these cases on the presence of extravasation or a leak of contrast material which is usually an indication for surgical exploration. Most intramural hematomata without perforation do not require intervention but resolve with supportive care unless there are bleeding complications. 13 Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse Types of Thoracic and Abdominal Injuries (Table ID Hypopharynx Esophagus Traumatic abdomen .................................................................................................................................

The vast majority (80%) of abuse fractures are seen in children under 18 months and only 2 % of fractures in this age group are of accidental origin. The importance of the skeletal survey, especially in children with head and visceral injuries, cannot be overstated in suspected child abuse cases under the age of 2 years because of the high likelihood of discovery of unsuspected fractures. Extremity fractures are the commonest abusive fractures and certain types of fractures are more specific for an abusive origin than others. The metaphyseal fracture of the long bones has long been identified as the most specific for inflicted injury, considered pathognomonic for abuse. This fracture\" has recently been studied and shown to be a planar fracture through the primary spongiosa region of the end of the long bones, producing a disc-like fragment at this site. This fractured portion of the bone, depending upon the projection of the x-ray beam, will appear as a fragment (comer fracture) or a semi-lunar loop (bucket-handle). The torsional force required to produce these lesions are those associated with the shaken baby syndrome or the application of rotational vectors to the long bones. The most common long bone fracture in child abuse involves the diaphysis, occurring four times more frequently than metaphyseal fractures. The femur, humerus and tibia are the long bones most often affected by transverse or oblique/spiral fractures but there are no specific types or locations for abusive fractures, emphasizing the need for careful hi~tory - taking, attention to the age of the child and use of the skeletal survey for children under 2 years of age. Toddler fractures - accidental oblique fractures of the tibia in the 9 month to 3 year old child- can occur without the knowledge of caretakers and produce symptoms of limp, 15 Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse disinclination to bear weight on the affected leg, or pain on standing. Fractures due to abuse also commonly involve the clavicle and forearms. Fractures of the hands and feet, scapulae, and pelvis are unusual in child abuse. Rib fractures, often unsuspected clinically and discovered by skeletal surveys, nevertheless constitute up to a quarter of fractures seen in abuse. Most of these are posterior fractures, occurring near the costovertebral articulation, owing to the levering action of the costovertebral transverse process articulating surface. The second most common location is in the midaxillary line. The fracture line in posterior fractures is usually on the anterior (visceral) surface of the rib while the fracture line in the midaxiUary fracture is on the outer surface of the rib. Because these fractures are produced by compressions of the thorax while the child is being held during shaking or forcefully ni,~t-ed up in anger by a caretaker, they are often multiple and bilateral. Overlying bruises of the thoracic wall may be observed, but often are absent. Unless the fractures have been present long enough to produce callus, they may not be discernible on plain radiography and it is in these cases that bone scintigraphy is most useful. Vertebral body fractures are being diagnosed more frequently as these fractures are seen to be more common than once thought. These fractures are anterior vertebral body compression fractures and are thought to be caused from hyperflexion during shaking or other violent handling. Skull fractures are grossly classified into simple and complex categories. Simple fractures are linear and do not cross suture lines; complex fractures are multiple, crossing suture lines, displaced, comminuted, diastatic or are depressed. Complex fractures do not result from trivial trauma and although they can be the result of accidental trauma, such trauma nearly always has a consistent history. Complex skull fractures alleged to have been acquired by falls from short heights or in unwitnessed falls are highly suspicious for abuse. 16 Module 1 Medic~ Evaluation of Physical Abuse Imaging Techniques The skeletal survey is the preferred diagnostic technique for suspected child abuse. Although radionuclide scintigraphy has certain useful applications (acute subtle fractures, rib fractures), it is not without inherent technical shortcoming and is dependent upon the level of competence of the radiologist interpreting it. Table III details the views recommended for the skeletal survey 17 Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse Table HI Elements of the Skeletal Survey Skull: Frontal and lateral (lateral to include the cervical spine) Spine: Frontal and lateral thoracolumbar spine (lateral to include the sternum) Chest: Frontal (for rib and spinal detail) Extremities: Upper: Frontal (to include shoulder and hands*) Lower: Frontal (to include lower lumbar spine, pelvis and feet)+ *Separate views of the hands and feet in larger infants and children + At least two views of each fracture should be obtained. Dating of Fractures Physicians are often asked to pinpoint the time ~ _ ~ary in child abuse cases. The ability to narrow the time frame is limited, but there are some precepts of value. O'Connor described the criteria used in dating fractures (Table IV). Table IV 1. Resolution of soft tissues 2-5 days i 4- 10 days i 10-21 days 2.

Kleinman, Baltimore, Williams & Wilkins, 1987. 18 Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse Cutaneous Injuries By far the most common manifestations of child abuse are cutaneous injuries. The types of lesions include bruises, abrasions, lacerations, petechiae, ecchymoses, and burns. The important characteristics of skin lesions when trying to distinguish accidental injuries from inflicted ones are the location, pattern, presence of multiple lesions of different ages and the failure of new lesions to appear during hospitalization or removal of the child from the caretaker. Table V Location of Cutaneous Injuries nflic~ed!~.: :.: ....: :: ...... iiii Lower arms ...S.i.d.e.s..of.fa.c..e ......................... ' Ears and neck Under chin Adapted from Pascoe J.M. et al: Patterns of skin injury in non-accidental and accidental injury. Pediatrics 1979; 64: 245. The inflicting instrument may be discerned from the shape of the skin lesion. The typical lesion left by an looped electric cord used for whipping may appear elliptical; a belt, buckle or wire coat hanger leave bruises conforming to their shapes; the human hantt may leave parallel linear stress petechiae representing the spaces between the fingers or scalloping lesions conforming to the metacarpal-phalangeal junction; adult human bites leave characteristic lesions which can be measured and compared with the dentition of the alleged 19 Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse perpetrator, gags leave downturned lesions at the comers of the mouth; lesions around the neck suggest ligatures applied in that location; ligatures applied to wrists and ankles to restrain the child will leave rope burns or pressure lines to those structures. Bruises of the upper arms or in the rib cage suggest encirclement bruises resulting from hard pressure applied during shaking or violent handling. Dating of bruises is an imperfect science due to the variability of skin color, healing characteristics, location of bruises and varying age groups of the children involved in abuse. Photodocumentation of bruises with color photography with clear identification of the patient and the date the photograph was taken can be of some value in assessing the age of bruises. More information, however, is needed to accurately judge the age of a bruise from its color. Burns It is estimated that between 12% and 30% of burns in children are non-accidental and that burns represent approximately 10 % of all abuse cases. In one large study of inflicted burns in 1979, 87% were scald burns and 13 percent were flame injuries. The peak age of the burn victims was from 13-24 months. The classic lesion is the immersion burn involving the buttocks, arms or ankles, sustained when a child is held in extremely hot water and producing either a doughnut lesion of the buttocks, sparing the portion of the buttocks resting against the relatively cooler porcelain of the tub, and showing sharp demarcation lines on the upper margins of the hot water-skin interface. This lesion, plus the stocking-glove immersion burns are easy diagnoses since they are so obviously due to restraint of the child. Likewise, bums of the palms and soles are diagnostic for inflicted injury unless the caretaker has an unusually convincing history of a mechanism of injury. Table VI summarizes the distinguishing characteristics of inflicted burns versus accidental bums. 20 Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse History Location Pattern Table VI Accidental versus Inflicted Burns Burns attributed to sibling Compatible with observed injury Unrelated adult seeks medical care Differing accounts of injuay Treatment delay > 24 hours Prior \"accidents\" No parental concern Lesion incompatible with history Buttocks, perineum, genitalia Ankles, wrists Palms, soles Sharply demarcated edges Stocking-glove distribution Full thickness Symmetrical Burns older than history indicates Burn neglected, infected Numerous lesions of varying ages Pattern of burn consistent with instrument Large area of uniform dry contact burn From of body Random and injury -specific Associated irregular splash burns Partial thickness Asymmetrical One traumatic event 21 Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse Non-accidental burns seem also to carry a higher correlation with social pathology than other forms of child abuse. In Hight's study of non-accidental bums, 2 7 of the 40 inflicted bum cases were either known to the state's protective service agencies or had been previously admitted with a variety of diagnoses including failure to thrive, poisoning, lead intoxication, fractures, head injuries, and previous bums. Rosenberg's study demonstrated that 19.5% of burns in children under the age of 3 years were of inflicted origin. 22 Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse Poisoning Although reports of poisoning of children are small in number, the true incidence is difficult to determine. Sobel called attention to the fact that repetitive accidental poisoning in childhood bore no relationship to home safety but was intimately associated with parental psychopathology and disturbed family relationships. (Bays describes the characteristics of abusive poisoning in her chapter \"Child Abuse by Poisoning\". In Reece R.M. ed. Child Abuse: Management. 1994. Malvern Pa. Lea and Febiger.) Table VII Clinical Indicators of Abuse by Poisoning Under one year or between 5-10 years History Nonexistent, discrepant or changing Does not fit child's development Previous poisoning in this child Previous poisoning in siblings Does not fit circumstances or scene Third party, often a sibling, is blamed Delay in seeking medical care Toxin Multiple toxins Substances of abuse Bizarre substances Presentation Unexplained seizures Life-threatening events Apparent sudden infant death syndrome Death without obvious cause Chronic unexplained symptoms that resolve when the child is protected. Other evidence of abuse or neglect. 23 Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy is a bizarre form of child abuse where the child is the victim of a form of mental illness of the mother the psychodynamics of which are poorly understood. It is defined as a circumstance in which 1) illness is simulated or produced by a parent (almost invariably the mother) or someone who is in loco parentis and 2) the child comes for medical assessment and care, usually persistently, often resulting in multiple medical procedures; and 3) knowledge about the etiology of the child's illness is denied by the perpetrator, and 4) acute symptoms and signs in the child abate when the child is separated from the perpetrator. Rosenberg has tabulated the presenting complaints, the methods of fabrication and the diagnostic strategies one may follow to make the diagnosis of MSBP and these are seen in Table VIII. 24 Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse Table VIII Bleeding 1.

The strategy of this process is to gather the team of caregivers in the hospital setting and discuss the evolving information on a regular basis. It is wise to alert the child protection agency, law enforcement and the prosecuting attorney's office that such a case is being investigated and sometimes to involve them at the outset in that investigation. Child psychiatry and child psychology should be added to the team if they are not already engaged and the hospital legal counsel, if not a member of the child protection team, should also attend the meetings. Covert video surveillance is sometimes employed in these cases and when that is being done it should be done with the full understanding of the ward team and the hospital administration and legal department. There are argqments about the use of covert video surveillance but those who favor its use argue that the goal of the hospital should be to diagnose and protect children and there are sometimes no other options than to collect data in this fashion. Extremely careful notes in the chart (or alternate record) are essential became the details are the most important ingredients in the formulation of the diagnosis. When the cases come before a court, it is essential that all involved with that proceeding are prepared to present their information and are sure of their facts. The ultimate outcome of the child's well- being will rest on this. Seldom does an opporttmity to diagnose MSBP on a subsequent admission occur. The long-term outcome of cases of MBP is poorly researched due to the disappearance of the families and the short history of the condition. It is hoped that in the next decade we will have a better understanding of the parental psychopathology as well as more information as to what happens to these unfortunate children. 26 Module 1 Medical Evaluation of Physical Abuse Bibliography Alexander, R.

If child abuse is suspected, the physician must fulfill mandated legal obligations to report the case to the appropriate authorities. Coroners, medical examiners and pathologists have the added responsibility of rendering a medicolegal opinion as to the cause and manner of death.

Law enforcement personnel and prosecutors need to proceed if the law has been broken. All agree that the state of our knowledge in this area is incomplete and ambiguity exists in some cases. For everyone concerned, it is necessary and desirable, within the limits of our capability, to know the cause and manner of an infant death. This process requires application of current knowledge, a desire to know the reasons for the deaths, the resources necessary to conduct essential procedures, and the sensitivity and wisdom to perform the task without causing distress to innocent family members. Historical Background The history relevant to this presentation is a relatively short one. In the first half of this century, searching for the reasons infants die was the lonely province of a few clinicians, researchers, and pathologists who examined the retrospective traces of infant deaths. Bergrnan recounts the slow progression of knowledge about sudden unexpected infant death in the pathologists laboratories and morgues where Werne and Garrow and then Adelson and Kinney proposed etiologies for \"crib death\" other than suffocation. Since the 1950s the pediatric pathologist Marie Valdes-Dapena has been the most consistent researcher, educator, and translator of scientific information about SIDS to the clinical community and the lay public, and her recent review summarizes this material. Parents who had lost their infants began to press the question \"Why did my baby die?' forming several grassroots organizations to raise public awareness and stimulate legislative activity to foster research and to provide centers for information and counseling for bereaved parents. Now called the SIDS Alliance, these efforts continue to spur research and greater public understanding of SIDS. Module 12 Fatal Child Abuse and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: A Critical Diagnostic Decision Simultaneously, the issue of child abuse was being confronted by a heretofore denying medical community. In 1946 John Caffey published an account of multiple fractures and subdural hematomas followed in 1953 by Silverman's postulation that these injuries were the result of unrecognized trauma. Adelson's 1961 paper entitled \"Slaughter of the Innocents\" added to the factual information about fatal child abuse. In 1962, C. Henry Kempe coined the phrase the \"Battered Child Syndrome\" and further raised the consciousness of the medical community about the unpleasant truth that infants and children were being physically abused and killed.' The stage was being set for a controversy about death in infancy, its causes, and the possibility of caretakers' culpability for those deaths. In 1972 a young African-American couple whose infant died suddenly and unexpectedly were charged with criminal neglect. Despite autopsy findings that were consistent with SIDS and no signs of neglect or abuse, the medical examiner indicated that the baby had died of abandonment and neglect. Although the charges were later dismissed, the couple spent six months in jail because of their inability to post bond. But misattribution of death can also occur at the other extreme. An egregious series of lapses and errors of judgment occurred in the case of Mary Beth Tinning, who was charged with smothering her adopted infant daughter. During the inquiry into this death, it was discovered that eight other of her biological children had died and their deaths had been attributed to SIDS or \"natural causes.\" News accounts of this case raised public awareness about the possibility of infant murders' being mistaken for crib death or other medical conditions. It is against this background that the need for an objective and integrated approach to the diagnosis is seen. Whenever an unexplained death occurs in infancy, the question of fatal child abuse must be addressed. Module 12 Fatal Child Abuse and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: A Critical Diagnostic Decision Definition of SIDS In 1989, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development promulgated the following definition of SIDS: \"The sudden death of an infant under one year of age which remains unexplained after the performance of a complete postmortem investigation, including an autopsy, an examination of the scene of death and review of the case history.\" Clinical Presentation of SIDS Typically, SIDS is suspected when an apparently previously healthy baby, usually younger than 6 months of age (peaking between 2 and 4 months of age), is found dead in bed in the early morning prompting an urgent call for emergency help. Emergency personnel respond and initiate cardiorespiratory resuscitation in the home and continue it on the way to the hospital, where the baby is finally pronounced dead. The infant's medical history is usually unremarkable. In many cases a history of a recent routine pediatric visit is elicited. The immediate antecedent history indicates that the baby had been fed his or her usual formula or breast milk and had been put to bed. At varying intervals the parents or other caretaker had checked the baby, who appeared to be normal, but later the baby had been discovered lifeless. No outcry had been heard and the baby had been found in the position in which he had been placed at bedtime or naptime. Evidence of terminal motor activity such as clenched fists may be seen and there may be some serosanguinous, watery, frothy, or mucoid discharge coming from the nose and mouth. The face and dependent portions of the body may have reddish-blue mottling due to postmortem lividity. 5 Module 12 Fatal Child Abuse and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: A Critical Diagnostic Decision Incidence and Epidemiology of SIDS In the United States approximately 5000 infants succumb to SIDS, annually a rate of about 1.4 per 1000 live births. For white infants, this is a rate of 1.24 per 1000 live births; for African-American infants the rate is 2.26 per 1000 livebirths. Incidence figures from other parts of the world vary from 0.036 to 6.3 per 1000 livebirths. The role of race and ethnicity are unclear but Kraus and Bultreys, in a careful review of SIDS and socioeconomic status (SES), concluded that the preponderance of evidence suggests a consistent inverse relation between SIDS and SES. But they cautioned that the SES effect may act as a confounder, effect modifier, or intermediate variable. SIDS has its peak incidence between 2 and 4 months of age. Very few cases occur in the first week of life, and SIDS cases diminish in number after the third month of life. Approximately 90 % of SIDS deaths have occurred by 6 months of age.\" SIDS is seen more often in boys (60% to 70% vs 30% to 40% in girls); it occurs more frequently in the winter months in both the northern and southern hemispheres, suggesting that temperature alone is not a causative factor 16 ; and it is more frequent in multiple births, with twins and triplets having a rate 21/2 times that of singleton babies. The death occurs silently, apparently during sleep. The absence of a deleterious role of the administration of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine has been demonstrated repeatedly. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development epidemiological study\" showed that in 757 SIDS cases there was an increased representation of premature and low birth weight babies and younger mothers; more mothers who smoked cigarettes during pregnancy; more babies who had thrush, pneumonia, and illnesses requiring hospitalization; more subtle neurological abnormalities; and more frequent reports during the neonatal period of tachypnea, tachycardia, cyanotic spells, and vomiting. Autopsy results in this study showed that some of the future SIDS victims had increased extramedullary hematopoeisis, periadrenal brown fat retention, and astroglial ghosis, but these Module 12 Fatal Child Abuse and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: A Critical Diagnostic Decision findings were far from uniform. The study concluded that not one or even combinations of these so-called \"risk factors\" were powerful enough to be predictive of future SIDS victims. The issue of recurrent SIDS within a family raises the possibility of genetically determined conditions. It also provokes questions of a forensic nature. In a 14-year study of subsequent siblings of SIDS victims in Norway, and in a Washington State study over 16 years, the SIDS sibling risk was seen to be almost four times that of the SIDS risk among births at large. But when SIDS occurrences among siblings of SIDS cases were compared with those among non-SIDS siblings in maternal age- and birth rank-matched control families, there was no statistically significant difference in SIDS rates or in total infant mortality rates in families with a history of SIDS compared with families with no SIDS. Thus, the notion that having a SIDS baby makes having another more likely was dispelled. With the exclusion from the SIDS statistics of some of the deaths now thought to be due to inborn errors of metabolism, the chances for subsequent SIDS in families seems even less likely. Distinguishing Between SIDS and Child Abuse In 1961 Adelson reported on 46 child homicides occurring between 1944 and 1961. Ten children were younger than 1 year of age. Of those, 5 drowned and 3 died of starvation. The causes of death of the other 2 are not described. In 1991 Adelson 21 reported 194 child homicides: 28 occurred before the baby was 1 year old, 16 occurred in infants between I month and 1 year, and 7 occurred between 1 month and 6 months of age. All were fatally and obviously battered. Therefore, in this series, there were no cases likely to be confused with SIDS. Emery and Taylor described a 24-year period in Sheffield, England (1960 to 1984), during which postperinatal deaths (birth to 2 years) were investigated by gathering information about the death scene, obstetric, and pediatric care, reviewing autopsy findings; and conducting extensive home visits. As a result of this process, accidental suffocation was thought to be the cause of death in 10% of these cases, and the possibility of active 7 Module 12 Fatal Child Abuse and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: A Critical Diagnostic Decision intervention on the part of one or both parents was raised in another 10%, a rate consistently double that of overt child abuse in this age group. Specific data on infants between 1 month and 1 year were not reported. Suggested etiologies for unexpected infant deaths that have been reported include accidental strangulation, intentional suffocation, and Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. Deaths in infant twins have also been studied extensively, both from the standpoint of the possible increased risk of death in the twin survivor of a SIDS death, and also to ascertain whether there is increased risk of being abused because of twin status. In 1982, Groothuis and coworkers reported on this latter phenomenon after studying 48 families with twins and 124 single-birth families, matched for hospital of delivery, birth date, maternal age, race, and socioeconomic status. Three control (2.4%) and nine twin (18.7%) families had been reported for maltreatment, with one fatality. Siblings of these twins were reported to have been abused more frequently than the twins themselves, and abuse was limited to the twins in only three families. When analyzing the variables in the families studied, the authors concluded that twin status had the greatest impact on the risk of subsequent child abuse, suggesting that the stress of rearing twins, added to the other elements of childrearing in already marginally functioning families, was a significant determinant for subsequent abuse. Beal, in her summary of the world's literature concerning the phenomenon of SIDS in twins (1956 through 1988), reported that 6 (I%) of 625 of the surviving twins had subsequently died of SIDS. Data concerning the rate of simultaneous twin SIDS are difficult to interpret, but Beal's estimate, based on published series, is 12 of 637 twin infant pairs, or 2 % of all twin sets in which SIDS occurs. In 1985, Christoffel et al examined 43 unexpected deaths in children brought to Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago during 1980 to 1981. Nine were due to child abuse and in 3 the correct diagnosis was established only by postmortem examination. In the same joumal issue, Kirschner and Stein described 10 cases in which the diagnosis of child abuse was made based on incomplete or erroneous medical observation. Five of those cases were 8 Module 12 Fatal Child Abuse and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: A Critical Diagnostic Decision autopsy-proven cases of SIDS. The recording of the clinical physical examinations had described conditions that were either postmortem changes (e.g., lividity, sphincter dilation), misinterpreted skin markings (mongoloid pigmentation), or a physical f'mding often seen in SIDS deaths (serosanguinous discharge from nose and mouth). These reports emphasize the need for appropriate evaluation both before and after death, including thorough physical examinations, autopsies, and death scene investigation. In utero toxic influences have long been suspected as contributing to sudden infant death. Hagland and Cnattingius have reported that cigarette smoking during pregnancy is a highly significant risk factor in the pathogenesis of SIDS. Chasnoff et al found in one study that infants born to mothers who use drugs during pregnancy have a 5- to 10-fold increase in the risk of SIDS. Bauchner et al studied the rate of SIDS in infants of cocaine-abusing mothers and in a control group from the same economic sector and 4.9 and 5.6 per 1000- rates that are consistent with other studies of SIDS rates in lower socioeconomic sectors. Bauchner and Zuckerman appropriately raised questions about study methodology when looking at the high incidence of SIDS associated with in utero drug exposure. They cited the need for accurate measurement of drug use by mothers; control for confounding variables such as cigarette smoking, polydrug use, crowded living conditions, race, low SES, prematurity, and low birth weight; an examination of the relationship between the timing and quantity of exposure of cocaine and the outcome of SIDS; and finally, they questioned the use of SIDS as an outcome measure if there is not strict adherence to the definition of SIDS when death ascertainments are made. The relationship of substance abuse during pregnancy and subsequent child abuse, if not also controlled for similar variables mentioned above, can be misleading. However, in a study of 100 cocaine-exposed infants and matched control infants followed for 2 years at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, OH, 7 have suffered physical injury, 37 have suffered from neglect, and 21 have been placed in substitute care. The SES-matched control group of non-cocaine-exposed infants has had no instances of abuse or neglect. Wallace found that among- 70 crack-using women with children, 34.3% had the Bureau of Module 12 Fatal Child Abuse and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: A Critical Diagnostic Decision Child Welfare involved in their children's lives as a result of the mother's crack use and the neglect or abuse that followed. Thirty-four percent of the children were placed in substitute care and another 15.7% were being cared for by relatives without formal Bureau involvement. A recent report by Famularo et al showed a strong association between substance abuse and child maltreatment. The rates of fatal child abuse directly attributable to substance abuse are unknown, but logic instructs that a fatal outcome is a natural consequence in a proportion of these reported instances of maltreatment. There are convincing data that at least in some cases, postpartum depression and other psychiatric disturbances, particularly in mothers who had histories of maltreatment themselves, have led to infanticide. Role and Importance of the Autopsy Although the autopsy has not elucidated the etiology for SIDS, and despite often equivocal results, it is still considered the sine qua non in determining the cause of sudden and unexpected death in infancy. But acceptance of this precept is not uniformly embraced throughout the United States even now. In Massachusetts, where the autopsy rate for infants has been close to 100% for several years, the data from the Massachusetts SIDS Center show that in 806 sudden, unexpected infant deaths from 1982 through 1990 there have been only 5 cases attributable to fatal child abuse (0.6%). In addition to the external findings of postmortem lividity and skin mottling often confused with bruising or other skin lesions, Valdes-Dapena has summarized the major morphological findings. Other less frequent lesions have been described. Evidence that respiratory syncytial virus infection produces life-threatening apneic episodes, in infants, reports of unexpected deaths of two infants with respiratory syncytial virus infection, together with autopsies consistent with SIDS have raised, once again, the question of the role of infection-this time of viral infection-as a possible factor in SIDS. Cytomegalovirus inclusion- bearing cells were recovered in the extraneural organs of 4 apparently healthy infants who died 10 Module 12 Fatal Child Abuse and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: A Critical Diagnostic Decision suddenly and unexpectedly; the authors also found glial nodules in the brainstems in each of these infants, causing them to speculate that such lesions could have affected neurons responsible for cardiorespiratory control.\" Huff reported finding cytomegalovirus cells in 7 % of 54 \"crib death\" babies as opposed to 1.2 % of 298 babies who had died of other causes. While these figures are not overwhelming, they do argue for a more careful search for such lesions and elucidation of their significance. Norman and colleagues studied 126 sudden unexplained deaths, excluding those due to accidents, child abuse, poisoning, or other explicable conditions. Of the 126, 86 (68%) were typical SIDS and less than 1% of them failed to have intrathoracic petechiae, a putative marker for SIDS whose significance is debated in the literature. Three had infections-granulomatous hepatitis pyelonephritis, and cytomegalovirus-none of which was sufficient to produce death. There were seven known or probable metabolic diseases accounting for a little over 5 % of the total. Their belief is that metabolic disease is most likely to be found in families in which there has been more than one child apparently dying of SIDS and in those infants with fatty livers at postmortem examination. The diverse metabolic diseases that can cause sudden infant death include disorders of fatty acid oxidation, organic acids, urea-cycle, amino acids, and carbohydrate metabolism. Current evidence from necropsy studies and from family studies suggests that about 1 in 10 of sudden unexpected deaths in infancy are due to inborn errors of metabolism. Despite the absence of hard data to support this assertion, certain additional steps would add to our knowledge and are recommended for the autopsy: body fluids (urine, blood, vitreous humor, cerebrospinal fluid, bile, and stomach contents) should be obtained and frozen at - 80'C; skin samples should be obtained and analyzed; blocks of brain, liver, kidney, heart, muscle, adrenals, and pancreas should be analyzed. Postmortem findings in cases of fatal child abuse demonstrate that the causes of death were injuries to the head or the abdominal viscera, bums, drowning, gunshots, exposure, suffocating, or a combination of these. In contrast to later series, poisoning was not often a factor. 11 Module 12 Fatal Child Abuse and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: A Critical Diagnostic Decision Radiographic Studies The use of radiographs as an ancillary study in postmortem examinations is routine in most jurisdictions. In most cases where radiographs are used, however, the \"babygram\" is the standard. Kleinman et al point out that a skeletal survey should be the choice of examination and that properly informed and motivated technologists should be able to obtain high quality postmortem skeletal surveys in most medical examiners offices. The widespread failure to obtain such studies is probably due more to inertia than to actual technical or economic factors. The clinical radiographic study commonly referred to as the \"skeletal survey\" has been outlined by Kleinman. It consists of numerous projections and is clearly superior to the \"babygram\" done in most autopsy settings. Death Investigation: Scene Investigation and Past Medical History In Adelson and Kinney's 1956 report on 126 infant fatalities, death scene investigations occurred in all but one family. This remarkable adjunct to the postmortem examination was certainly unique at that time and indeed has not been the standard even in the recent past. Smialek and Lambras has observed that by delaying the death scene investigation one may lose accurate documentation of the scene in terms of the environmental risk factors and risk factors associated with sleeping conditions. Prompt interviewing of the discovering caretaker is needed to ascertain details of the infant's situation when first found lifeless. The gathering of information from physicians familiar with the baby and the family and from local child protection agencies should also be accomplished. Stanton and Oakley, reporting on the patterns of illness observed before unexpected infant death, found that 16% of the infants who subsequently died unexpectedly had been previously admitted to a hospital compared with 5.4% of age matched control infants. Nearly half of those who died had been admitted prior to 2 months of age. Child abuse had been diagnosed in 8 of the 71 admitted infants and failure to thrive in 24. The bulk of the other admissions were for infection and loss of consciousness. 12 Module 12 Fatal Child Abuse and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: A Critical Diagnostic Decision In the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development study, to a statistically significant degree, the 757 SIDS babies had more often been sick and had been previously hospitalized. These patterns of illness are important data in the investigation of sudden unexpected infant death. Taylor and Emery reviewed 65 postperinatal deaths in Sheffield, England, and found that 35 of the infants had had diseases or conditions present before the eighth day of life. Proven nonaccidental injury was seen in two cases, and \"gentle battering\"- meaning extreme concern in the death review conference because of discrepant histories, social chaos, and a pattern of unusual childrearing practices before death-in three. There were 19 infants certified as \"cot deaths\" (SIDS). 13 Module 12 Fatal Child Abuse and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: A Critical Diagnostic Decision Criteria for Distinguishing SIDS from Fatal Child Abuse and Other Medical Conditions History surrounding death Age at death PE and laboratory studies at time of death History of pregnancy, delivery and infancy Death scene investigation Consistent With SIDS Apparently healthy infant fed, put to bed, Found lifeless.

Twenty years have passed since Bergman' found that only 25 % of sudden and unexpected deaths in the United States had the benefit of an autopsy to establish the cause of death in suspected SIDS cases. It is hoped that a contemporary survey would show a better rate, but even then it must be recognized that the autopsy is only one component of a proper approach in establishing the cause of death. Moreover, death ascertainment should be accomplished in all children younger than the age of 18 years, not just in infants. Because this is such an egregious omission in the conduct of the medical, social, and legal stewardship of our children, momentum has been building to analyze childhood deaths by means of child death review teams. This approach has been superbly described in a series of four manuals prepared by the Child Maltreatment Fatalities Project of the American Bar Association Center on Children and the Law and the American Academy of Pediatrics. The information compiled by means of the detailed investigation suggested in these publications will provide the most reliable determination of cause and manner of death. 16 Module 12 Fatal Child Abuse and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: A Critical Diagnostic Decision If child abuse or neglect is a contributory factor in a substantial proportion of unexpected infant deaths, what should be done to minimize mistakes in the ascertainment of the cause and manner of death? The following recommendations are offered: 1. Accurate history-taking by emergency responders and medical personnel at the time of death and made available to the medical examiner or coroner Examination of the dead infant at a hospital emergency department (Often such babies are taken directly to the morgue, depriving the case of clinical appraisal prior to autopsy.) Protocol postmortem examinations within 24 hours of death, including toxicology and metabolic screening when deemed appropriate in the context of the complete evaluation of the infant's death Prompt death-scene investigation by knowledgeable individuals including careful interviews of the household members Collection of previous medical records from all sources of medical care and personal interviews of key medical providers Detailed collection of medical history from caretakers, using a standardized medical history questionnaire Locally based infant death review teams to review the collected data with participation of the medical examiner or coroner in the review Use of accepted diagnostic categories on death certificates as soon as possible after review Prompt informing sessions with parents when the results indicate SIDS or medical causation of death (High-quality medical examiner's offices inform parents of SIDS cases as soon as the results of the gross autopsy findings are available.) 10. Recognition of all the diagnostic elements comprising the decision about infant deaths (Table) 11. Maintenance of a supportive approach to parents during the death review process 12. Adequate funding of this critical process, both for death ascertainment and for the protection of all infants and children 13. Stimulation and support of more research into the etiology of both SIDS . . . 9. 17 Module 12 Fatal Child Abuse and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: A Critical Diagnostic Decision Bibliography Adelson L.

Physicians reluctant to diagnose FTT on two points. Ask for assessment for deviation from normal development - age and gender PHYSICIAN INTER VIEW Most important question-what produced this child's emaciated condition-what is the physician's specific assessment? Document what is said and the basis for their conclusions. I 53 e**~,~-i*t EXCLUDING OR GANIC EXPLANATIONS Organic basis? Tests required? If organic, did condition cause emaciation or merely predispose the child against gaining weight? Medical history, pre-natal and birth history. Growth history at hospital (24 hrs) and any subsequent admissions Feed child in controlled environment and plot growth for a few months-then file EXCLUDING OR GANIC EXPLANATIONS Establish whether malnutrition is acute or chronic Children rarely are emaciated in a few days. Often caretakers will tell you weight lost in last 48 hrs. Acute FTT shows signs of emotional deprivation-fetal position, vacant eyes, little response to external stimuli. Document! Concluding Questions for Attending Physician What does the physician think of the plausibility of the caretaker's version of the child's feeding history? Did parent's actions seem reasonable given the child's condition? Why? Criminal charges may be warranted irrespective of organic condition if caretaker failed to get medical attention when child was clearly wasting away 54 CARETAKER INTERVIEW Critical - law enforcement ifcaregiver is willing If caretaker invokes, they will probably still answer medical staff questions when child's history is being taken Parents/caregivers should be questioned about significant events surrounding conception, rape, pregnancy wanted? em,l~m CARETAKER INTERVIEW Questions concerning prenatal care, child's disposition, feeding and sleeping habits are important. Questions about parenting skills are important to determine whether actions were made out of ignorance or intentional, ie, \"Did you feed the baby three times a day?\" How was the formula mixed? Diluted? BIRTH RECORDS Birthing classes? Parenting classes? Feeding methods taught? Any medical problems that would affect child's development adversely? Successful prosecution depends on establishing caretaker had the requisite legal competence and mental state to understand the child was wasting away. 55 DEFENSES Undiagnosed medical condition: 1. preventable with proper medical care if condition exists at all 2. obvious to a reasonable person child needed medical attention 3. caregiver was legally competent and understood child needed medical attention DEFENSES PoveFt~: 1. family too poor to obtain necessary food or medical care 2. look for evidence of money spent on non- necessities: alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, cable t.v., or family received public assistance and had access to resources for the baby. DEFENSES Ignorance: caregivers were ignorant of basic child feeding and rearing needs. 1. parenting classes 2. raised other children 3. child survived fine for a period of time 4. other evidence supporting competence 56 DEFENSES Everyone in our family is short-we all grow out of it. 1. Even short children do not waste away 2. Ask physician to adjust chart for premature child. DEFENSES Child was healthy - lost weight rapidly I. Thorough medical workup should demonstrate whether malnutrition is chronic or acute 2. Very rare that emaciation occurs rapidly DEFENSES Transportation - no means to transport the child to medical care or to purchase food. Investigation may reveal that caregiver had access to free bus tickets or indigent transportation services connected to a medical center or clinic and chose not to use them. ._-_%7 AUTOPSY Ask medical examiner to determine effects of malnutrition on the ultimate cause of death. Many deaths are classified from natural causes with malnutrition as a secondary cause. \"But For\" test - cases that list cause of death from natural causes with malnutrition as a secondary cause can still be prosecuted if the child would not have died but for the complications of malnutrition. AUTOPSY Autopsy should document type and condition of food in victim's stomach and intestines to assist in establishing time of death and refute or corroborate caregiver's statement as to when the child was last fed. The medical examiner should photograph and note loss of fat tissue and muscle wasting to illustrate the progressive deterioration of the child's condition over time. ~Tm AUTOPSY - Calculation of caloric deficit to determine degree of food deprivation. This method was developed by Meade & Brissie, 30 J. Forensic Sci. 1263, (I 985) Infanticide by Starvation. Photographs are critical to proving starvation. Photograph entire body against a non-white background to reduce glare (ABFO Bar - ColoO 58 AUTOPSY Careful measurements are required both at the time of presentation and at autopsy. Skin tents and cradle caps should be noted and explained within the context of the child's death. Proving your Case Juries are reluctant to believe a parent would starve their child to death Prove parents were well aware of child's condition and failed to seek help.

McGuire Battered child syndrome \"exists when a child has sustained repeated and/or serious injuries by non-accidental means...Evidence demonstrating BCS helps to prove that the child died at the hands of another and not by falling off a couch, for example; it also tends to establish that the 'other,' whoever it may be, inflicted the injuries intentionally.

Highly suggestive interviews themselves undermine reliability in the child's account.

Ceci and Maggie Bruck published by American Psychological Association What the Expert Witness on Children \"s SiLggestibility Should Tell the Court 4. Finally it is important that the court appreciate the complexity of the interrelationships among the factors affecting children's report accuracy. As in most areas of social science, effects are rarely as straightforward as one might wish. For example, even though suggestibility effects may be robust, they are not inevitable, nor are they ineluctably large in magnitude... Ceci & Bruck, Jeopardy in the Courtroom 94 \"...

O. Box 88 Jefferson City, MO 65103-0088 314-751-5980 1-800-487-1626 The following protocol is a guideline for a comprehensive pediatric autopsy when the manner of death is uncertain or suspicious. Clinical judgment is required, on a case-by- case basis, to determine which procedures are performed. I. INVESTIGATION A. Review of Records Prior to beginning the autopsy, ideally all records that are available should be reviewed and all further records that are necessary should be ordered. These records would include all investigative reports, DFS records, police report, paramedic reports, emergency room records and the previous hospital and/or physician's records, including results of laboratory examinations and X-rays: Medical insurance records might be useful in providing information on previous illness, accident or medical treatment. The medical record is likely to be incomplete due to the emergency situation facing a physician when a severely ill or injured child is brought to the hospital. It is important to discuss with the attending physician, as soon as possible after the death of a child, his or her recollection of not only the injuries but the general clinical status, history and family situation. The physician should also be queried with regard to resuscitation performed. B. Family History Prior to the autopsy, the pathologist should obtain as much of the child's personal history and family history as possible. This should include developmental, medical and social history. This history may give important clues to findings at autopsy and their interpretation. More often than not, this information will be obtained by medical personnel, DFS investigators or law enforcement. C. Agency Investigation It is important to have an open line of communication between those agencies responsible for investigation, cause and manner of death determination and possible prosecution. Intense collaboration with the local child fatality review panel is ideal. D. Scene Investigation A scene investigation by the pathologist/investigator is often essential in evaluating mechanisms of injury. Furthermore, the home environment including cleanliness, safety hazards, neighborhood, pets, quantity and quality of food, medications, etc., may provide important information in making the cause/manner of death determination. II. AUTOPSY: GENERAL EXAMINATION A. Confirm identification, if known An identification tag should be attached to the body. Identification can be confirmed by a relative or other person who know the child. If the identification of the child is unknown. Footprints should be obtained at the completion of the autopsy. If the body is decomposed or skeletalized, dental, radiologic or anthropologic identification will be necessary. B. Identification of photographs Photographs are an essential part of the autopsy record and should be used to document all of the injuries to the child. Each photograph should have a ruler and identification tag present. There should be one photograph of the face for later identification purposes in court. The photographs should systematically cover each region of the body. Individual lesions or groups of lesions must be photographed at close range. A normal focal length lens is not sufficient for proper autopsy photography. A macro lens is essential. Available room light will not provide proper color balance. Either flash or photo-flood light must be used, each with he film that will provide proper color balance. Several Kodak publications provide guidance for setting up a photographic facility. C. Examination of Clothing and All Items Accompanying the Body It is essential that the body be brought to the autopsy suite with the clothing and other associated items undisturbed. The police must be discouraged from removing the clothing at the scene. The clothing and other personal items should be examined and described. This examination should be done in the presence of an evidence technician from the crime laboratory of the appropriate police jurisdiction. Tears, blood stains and the general cleanliness of the clothing should be described. D. Search for Trace Evidence A search should be made for hairs, fibers or other trace evidence that may be on the body or clothing. As appropriate, these should be removed prior to removal of the clothing, identified and given to the crime laboratory evidence technicians. The clothing should subsequently be removed and the body again searched for trace evidence. If there is suspicion of sexual abuse, oral, rectal and vaginal swabs should be taken for antigenic typing of semen and/or microbiological studies, as appropriate. The technique used should be established in consultation with crime laboratory personnel. Swabs of bite marks should be taken. These specimens must be obtained prior to washing the body. E. Radiologic Skeletal Survey A complete skeletal survey should be done at the start of the autopsy, and the films must be available for review during autopsy. Films should also be reviewed by a radiologist experienced in child trauma whenever possible. III. EXTERNAL EXAMINATION In addition to photographs of the body, body charts and diagrams should be prepared to document essential findings at the autopsy. A. General Appearance The general appearance of the child should be documented. This should include height and weight, head circumference in children less than two, body stature, the presence or absence of rigor mortis and the locations of post mortem lividity if it is present. A general description of the body is appropriate in any autopsy. The time of death occasionally cannot be accurately determined. Although drop in body temperature, rise in vitreous potassium and other post mortem events may give an approximation of the time of death, there are so many biological variables present in such a determination that it is prudent to be circumspect in one's opinion. B. Cleanliness Is the child's skin clean? Is there dirt present in skin folds? Is this an acute or chronic status? Poor hygiene may be manifested by severe chronic diaper rash, linenification of the skin and chronic seborrhea. C. Nutrition Nutritional assessment of the child can be made by comparing its height and weight to standard growth curve charts. Include gross description of presence of body fat. D. Dehydration Is dehydration present? In young infants, the fontanelle may be depressed. Sunken eyes, poor skin turgor and dry mucosal membranes are gross indicators of dehydration. Vitreous humor electrolyte analysis may show an elevated urea nitrogen and sodium level. Dehydration usually reflects an acute condition. E. Failure to Thrive This may be due to metabolic disorders, congenital anomalies or chronic disease. Chronic abuse, nutritional deprivation and emotional neglect can also cause failure to thrive. F. Congenital Anomalies Is there evidence of any congenital anomalies? Are there manifestations of a generic disorder or of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome? G. Any Evidence of Abuse/Neglect If the child is normal size for age, shows no evidence of dehydration or poor hygiene, and has no evidence of cutaneous or sexual injury, then this should be mentioned as an essential negative finding. H. Evidence of Sexual Abuse If there is no physical evidence of sexual abuse, then this should be recorded as an essential negative finding. If there is evidence of sexual abuse, this should be described under evidence of injury to the perineal region, rectum and genitalia. I. Evidence of Bite Marks If injuries suspicious of bite marks are present, a forensic odontologist or crime laboratory technician should be consulted prior to proceeding with the autopsy. Failure to observe this rule may cause irretrievable loss of evidence. The skin should not be washed prior to examination of the bite marks since this will prevent attempts at recovery of dried saliva for evaluation. Bite marks should not be excised since any attempt will produce tissue distortion. IV. EVIDENCE OF EXTERNAL INJURY Child abuse injuries may be numerous, of different ages, produced by a variety of blunt trauma and other forms of injuries and involve many parts of the body. As a result, describing child abuse injuries can be tedious and confusing to the reader of the protocol if the description is not given in some organized tabulated form. This can be done by separately describing external injuries and internal injuries, by breaking down the description of injuries into various anatomic regions of the body and by separately describing recent injuries, healing injuries and healed injuries. A. Recent Injuries These are often best described by anatomic region. The type of injury (contusion, abrasion or laceration) should be identified and dimensions given. In suspected beating cases, lengthwise incisions through the skin and subcutaneous tissues of the involved anatomic regions should be made to determine the depth to which hemorrhage extends. This provides an indication of the severity of the blunt force used and may also reveal significant soft tissue injury not apparent from examination of the skin surface. If the injury is patterned, a description of the pattern should supplement the photograph of the injury. Sections through representative lesions should be taken for microscopic examination. B. Healing Injuries These should be described in a manner similar to the description of the recent injuries. Sections of representative injuries should be taken for microscopic examination. C. Healed Injuries The pattern of scars is frequently characteristic of the type of implements used to produce the injuries. Scars should be recorded in a mariner similar to description of other injuries. V. EVIDENCE OF INTERNAL INJURY These injuries are often best described by anatomic region. It is important to attempt to date the injuries both grossly and by microscopic examination. Where possible, internal injuries should be correlated with external injuries. VI. EVIDENCE OF SKELETAL INJURY This description should based on X-ray examination and direct examination. Again, it is important to attempt to determine the age of the various lesions. VII. EVIDENCE OF RESUSCITATION Evidence of resuscitation must be described. Direct injection of epinephrine into the heart may produce pericardial hemorrhage. Lesions such as rib fractures, intra- abdominal hemorrhage, liver lacerations and other internal injuries should be presumed as not due to resuscitation unless proved otherwise. Even vigorous resuscitation in a young child will rarely, if ever, produce these injuries. VIII. EVIDENCE OF THERAPY Prolonged hospitalization may obscure evidence of injury, and even brief hospitalization and therapy may alter the appearance of injuries. All findings related to therapy should be described. IX. INTERNAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL This examination should mention positive and negative findings regarding the neck, organs of the chest and organs of the abdomen in regard to antecedent disease or abnormality. X. SYSTEMS REVIEW Each organ system should be described separately as with a usual medical autopsy. Special procedures include dissection of the posterior neck region in suspected shaken baby autopsies. It may also be necessary to remove the eyes to examine for evidence of retinal hemorrhage. XI. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION This should include section of representative injury sites as well as routine sections of internal organs. The injury process evolves much more rapidly in young children than in adults, and this must be considered when dating the age of injuries. The usual time required for resolution of an injury may be affected by the child's state of nutrition, intercurrent infection and coma. XII. SPECIAL STUDIES A. Post Mortem Chemistry Vitreous humor should be saved for appropriate electrolyte and chemistry studies. Serum and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) should also be saved, as necessary. B. Toxicology Samples of blood, bile, urine and gastric contents should be saved for toxicologic analysis. Where unusual drugs or poisons are suspected, other tissues should be saved as appropriate. C. Microbiology Where appropriate, specimens of blood, lung, brain or other tissues should be taken for culture. D. Neuropathology The brain should be fixed in formalin and dissected after fixation in cases where head injury is apparent or suspected. E. Other Studies Other types of studies should be considered as appropriate. XIII. PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS The pathologic diagnoses should be listed in a clear and concise manner. XIV. COMMENT OR OPINION A brief comment or opinion based on correlation of history, investigative reports, autopsy findings and laboratory studies should indicate the cause of death and the manner of death. Frequently, the final opinion in the case must be deferred until consultation with other involved agencies and a group discussion of the facts in the case. If a decision cannot be reached regarding the cause and/or manner of death, then the death certificate will indicate these to be undetermined. This represents the opinion of the medical examiner/coroner based on all of the information available to him or her. XV. RADIOGRAPHIC VIEWS FOR SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE DURING POSTMORTEM EXAMINATIONS A. Anterior/posterior and lateral skull. B. Anterior/posterior torso, to include chest, abdomen and pelvis, with penetration adequate to visualize the posterior ribs. 1. For these anatomical areas, a single film is used. Usually a single 14 x 17 accommodates these areas. Occasionally, multiple films may be needed. 2. Decubitus views of the chest may be helpful when there is the possibility of pneumothorax. 3. The decubitus view and/or crosstable view of the chest are additional views useful for diagnosing pneumonmediastinum and pneumothorax. 4. In cases of possible perforated viscus, free air in the abdominal cavity can be detected with a ten-minute abdominal film in the upright position of left lateral abdominal decubitus film. C. Anterior/posterior of the Upper and Lower Extremities Arms and forearms should be done individually. Because of postmortem flexion contractures, views of the hands and feet are not routinely done. D. Extremity Joints Right and left shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knees and ankle. Individual anterior/posterior views of these joints with centering over each joint. E. Lateral View of the Entire Spine Individual views of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine are best for detail. Multiple exposures on a single 14 x 17 film can be done. A cone down view of the cervical spine may be necessary. F. Other Studies Sometimes fractures, especially rib fractures, cannot be identified on preautopsy films. Injuries discovered during autopsy are subsequently radiographed. Sometimes it is best to remove the skeletal part for radiographic examination.

The best car seat is one that meets your child's age and size requirements and is compatible with your car. Children are safer in the back seat of the vehicle. Generally, the middle seating position is the safest place in the car, but ONLY IF the child's car seat and the vehicle seat are compatible and you can get a tight fit. To find out which seat is best for your child's age and size, visit our Child Car Seat Locator. Due to the countless variations of car seats, vehicle seats and safety belt systems, the most important thing you can do to make sure your child's car seat is installed properly is to thoroughly read BOTH your car seat manufacturer's instructions and your vehicle owner's manual. Once you've done that, if you are still unable to secure the seat properly, attend a Car Seat Check Up event (remember.\" the Car Seat Check Up event list at this web site is updated weekly, so keep http://www.safekids.org/faq.html 04/22/2000 Frequently Asked Questions Page 2 of 7 checking for an event near you). For more information about purchasing a car seat, recalled car seats and for a list of certified child passenger safety technicians, and frequently asked questions, visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's web site at www.nhtsa.dot.gov. 2. At what age should I turn my infant's car seat around to face forward? An infant should stay rear-facing until at least 1 year and at least 20 pounds to reduce the risk of cervical spine injury in the event of a crash. Many infant-only seats and convertible seats are tested up to 20 or 22 pounds rear-facing, which is a problem when an infant reaches 20-22 pounds before his/her first birthday. Fortunately, there are seats for weights higher than 22 pounds in the rear-facing position. The Safeline Corporation Sit and Stroll (1-800-829-1625) goes up to 25 pounds rear facing. The Evenflo Horizon, Secure Choice and Medallion (1-800-837-9201) all go up to 30 pounds rear facing, as do the Century Smart-Move and Bravo (1-888-5-CAR SEAT). The Britax Roundabout (1-888- 4Britax) goes up to 30 pounds rear facing. The Cosco Touriva and Alpha-Omega (1-800-544-1108) go to 35 pounds rear facing. Important: Check labels for these seats to confirm the weight limits! Read both the car seat instructions and the vehicle owner's manual for correct use and installation of your car seat. / 3. What about air bags and kids? Air bags have been designed to help protect adults in a front-end collision, but not children. So it is very important that all children ages 12 and under be properly restrained in the back seat. NEVER put a rear-facing infant in the front passenger seat of a vehicle with an active passenger-side air bag. If it is absolutely necessary for a child to ride in the front seat of a car with a passenger-side air bag: Never put an infant (less than 1 year old) in the front seat of a vehicle with an active passenger- side air bag, Secure the child in a restraint system that is correct for the size of the child -- a front-facing car seat, a booster seat, or a lap/shoulder belt, Move the front seat as far back away from the dashboard as possible, and Never allow a child to lean forward toward the dashboard. If you have more car seat questions, visit SafetyBeltSafe U.S.A. at www.carseat.org 4. What are some things I should look for in a bike helmet? Make sure the bike helmet meets safety standards. Look for an ASTM, Snell or ANSI sticker or the new federal standard certification sticker inside the helmet and on the box. The bike helmet should sit squarely on your child's head, cover his forehead and not rock side to side or forward to back. Bring r http://www.safekids.org/faq.html 04/22/2000 Frequently Asked Questions Page 3 of 7 your child to the store to try on helmets before you purchase one. Make sure the helmet fits snugly and comfortably when the helmet straps are buckled. 5. We want to build a pool in our yard. How can we make sure it's safe? The pool should be surrounded by four-sided isolation fencing, at least five feet high, equipped with self-closing and self-latching gates. Adults should be on hand at all times to supervise and should know CPR. Keep rescue equipment, a telephone and emergency number poolside. It's also important to remember that pool covers are not designed to prevent children from drowning, so watch children carefully even around a pool that's covered. Keep water from collecting on the pool cover surface. Most importantly, NEVER leave a child unsupervised in or around a swimming pool, even for a second. 6. What makes some playgrounds safer than others? The safest playgrounds are those that are well maintained (no broken, protruding or loose parts) and have ample soft surfacing. Recommended surface materials include hardwood fiber, mulch chips, pea gravel, fine sand and shredded rubber. Surfacing should be kept at least 12 inches deep and should extend a minimum of 6 feet in all directions around stationary equipment. Avoid playgrounds with asphalt, concrete, grass and soil surfaces under the equipment. Make sure that children are supervised at all times and that they play on age-appropriate equipment. 7. How can I keep my child safe from lead poisoning? Protect your children from lead poisoning by encouraging them to wash their hands frequently. Contact the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission with concerns about any consumer product that may contain lead. Ifyour home was built prior to 1979, you may want to have the paint tested by lead-abatement professionals. If you believe your child may have been exposed to lead, ask your pediatrician to test his or her blood lead levels. 8. I own a gun and have children in my home. What safety precautions should I take? You should always store firearms unloaded and locked up, with ammunition locked in a separate location that is up and out of reach of children. Use gun locks, load indicators and other safety devices on all firearms. You should also teach your children never to touch a gun and to tell an adult immediately if they ever find a gun. 9. At what age can my child cross the street alone? http://www.safekids.org/faq.html 04/22/2000 Frequently Asked Questions Page 4 of 7 In general, children 10 and over are able to cross the street safely by themselves. Children under the age of 10 should only cross the street under the supervision of an adult. Children ages 5 to 9 are at greatest risk for pedestrian death and injury. These children tend to think they are more independent than they are. Developmentally, they do not have the skills to make decisions about traffic patterns and do not clearly perceive danger. 10. What should I look for when buying a crib? A safe crib will be certified to meet national safety standards and will have no more than 2 3/8 inches of space between slats or spindles and a mattress that fits snugly. The drop-side latches must work properly and be safe from unintentional release or release by a baby inside the crib. Crib comerpost extensions or protrusions should not exceed 1/16 inch, including decorative knobs. Always keep the side rail locked in its up position when the baby is in the crib. Never use a pillow in the crib and remove all crib toys when your child is asleep. Do not place cribs near radiators, heating vents, windows, venetian blind strings, drapery cords or other hanging strings. 11. Are baby walkers really dangerous? Yes. Each year, more than 16,000 children are treated in hospital emergency rooms for baby walker- related injuries. DO NOT USE BABY WALKERS WITH WHEELS. There are several alternatives on the market that are stationary. Look for one that is on a stable, non-moveable base and place it away from stairs, hot appliances and window blind or drapery cords. Remember that children should never be left unattended -- whether using a walker alternative or not. 12. What temperature should I set my hot water heater at to protect my child from scalding? Hot water heaters should be set at 120 degrees Fahrenheit or below in order to avoid scald burns to children. 13. Where in my home should I put the smoke alarm? Install smoke alarms in every sleeping area and on every level of your home. Central locations such as the living room, the top of the stairwell and outside bedroom doors are good places. 14. How often should I replace my smoke alarm? Test smoke alarms once a month and replace batteries at least once a year. The alarm itself should be replaced every 10 years. http://www.safekids.org/faq.html 04/22/2000 Frequently Asked Questions Page 5 of 7 15. Where should I put a carbon monoxide (CO) detector in my home and what do I do if it goes off?. Carbon monoxide, or CO, is a poisonous gas that kills many people in the United States each year. In 1997, more than 3,000 children ages 5 and under were poisoned by CO. You can't hear, see, taste or smell the CO, but a CO detector can sense if it's in the air and alert you immediately. Place CO detectors outside of sleeping areas and at least 15 feet away from fuel-burning appliances such as furnaces, wood stoves and fuel-burning kitchen stoves. If your CO detector goes off, ventilate the home immediately by opening windows and outside doors. If anyone starts to experience flu-like symptoms, evacuate the house and call the fire department. After ventilating the home, you should turn off all fuel-burning appliances and call a qualified technician to inspect for sources of CO. 16. What is a small parts tester and where can I buy one? Small Parts Testers, also known as \"choke tubes,\" are designed for testing which objects are small enough to pose a choking hazard to kids age 3 and under. If the item fits in the tester, it is too small for children this age. Many discount stores, toy stores, hardware stores and safety device catalogs offer Small Parts Testers, which cost around $1.00- $2.00. 17. Where can I get childproofing devices? Childproofmg devices, such as electric socket covers, safety gates and window guards, can be purchased at hardware stores, baby supply stores, some discount stores and through baby supply catalogs. 18. Who do I contact ifI have safety concerns about a consumer product? Report any product-related injury or safety concern about consumer products, including toys, to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Call their hotline at (800) 638-CPSC or visit their web site at http://www.cpsc.gov. For questions about car seats, call the National Highway Traffic Safety Adminstration's auto safety hotline at (800) 424-9393. 19. What should I have in my first aid kit? http://www.safekids.org/faq.html 04/22/2000 Frequently Asked Questions Page 6 of 7 First aid kits can be purchased already assembled or you can make your own. Make sure the kit includes the following basic supplies: adhesive or gauze bandages or wrappings or pads surgical tape soap sterile gauze absorbent cotton adhesive tape tweezers sharp scissors cotton-tipped swabs tissues thermometer first aid manual aspirin and acetaminophen syrup oflpecac and activated charcoal antiseptic solution (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) antiseptic cream (e.g., bacitracin) hydrocortisone cream (for bites and stings) anti-diarrhea medication elastic bandages Band-Aids dosage spoon for medications calamine lotion for skin irritations ice pack and heating pad/water bottle flashlight with working batteries pocket mask or face shield for CPR needle for splinter removal disposable rubber gloves petroleum jelly http://www.safekids.org/faq.html 04/22/2000 Frequently Asked Questions Page 7 of 7 20. What household plants are poisonous? Contrary to popular belief, poinsettias are not poisonous plants (although they can cause some skin irritations). However, there are many plants to be concerned about. Poisonous plants include, but are not limited to: Angel's Trumpet (Datura meteloides) ://www.safekids. org/faq.html 04/22/2000 home injury fact sheet Page 1 of 2 HOME INJURY Unintentional injury is the leading cause of death among children ages 14 and under. In 1997, more than 6,040 children died from unintentional injuries; more than 40 percent of these deaths occurred in and around the home. Home injury deaths are caused primarily by fire and bums, drowning, suffocation, choking, firearms, poisoning, and falls. Young children are at the greatest risk from unintentional injuries in the home because it is where they spend the majority of their time. As children grow older, they spend less time in the home and the incidence of home injury deaths diminishes. The percentage of non-fatal unintentional injuries that occur in the home also decreases with age. DEATHS IN THE HOME In 1998, approximately 1,900 children ages 14 and under died in the home from unintentional injuries. Nearly 70 percent of these deaths occurred among children ages 4 and under. Among the leading causes of death in the home are: Fire and Burns In 1998, approximately 550 children ages 14 and under died from fires and bums in the home. Of these children, 55 percent were ages 4 and under. Drowning In 1998, an estimated 440 children ages 14 and under drowned in or around the home. Of these children, 80 percent were ages 4 and under. SutTocation In 1998, an estimated 370 children ages 14 and under suffocated in the home. Of these children, more than 80 percent were ages 4 and under. Choking In 1998, more than 160 children ages 14 and under choked to death in the home. Of these children, three-quarters were ages 4 and under. Unintentional Firearm Injury In 1998, an estimated 80 children ages 14 and under died from unintentional shootings in the home. Of these children, three-quarters were ages 5 to 14. Poisoning In 1998, an estimated 80 children ages 14 and under died from poisonings in the home. Half of these deaths were due to solids and liquids such as medicines and cleaners; the remaining deaths were due to gases and vapors, principally carbon monoxide. Falls http://www.safekids.org/fact99/home99.html 04/22/2000 home injury fact sheet Page 2 of 2 In 1998, an estimated 60 children ages 14 and under died as the result of falls in the home. Half of these deaths were to children ages 4 and under. INJURIES IN THE HOME Each year, more than 4.5 million children ages 14 and under are treated in hospital emergency departments (EDs) for injuries incurred in the home. Nearly two-thirds of the injuries requiring ED visits among children under age 3 occur in the home. Conversely, one-third of the injuries requiring ED visits among children ages 12-14 occur in the home. 12/99 This information was compiled by the National SAFE KIDS Campaign. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/home99.html 04/22/2000 bike-95-FS Page 1 of 4 BICYCLE INJURY The bicycle injury death rate among children ages 14 and under declined 48 percent between 1987 and 1997. However, bicycles remain associated with more childhood injuries than any other consumer product except the automobile. More than 70 percent of children ages 5 to 14 (27.7 million) ride bicycles. This age group rides about 50 percent more than the average bicyclist and accounts for approximately 24 percent of all bicycle-related deaths and more than 50 percent of all bicycle-related injuries. Head injury is the leading cause of death in bicycle crashes and is the most important determinant of bicycle-related death and permanent disability. Head injuries account for more than 60 percent of bicycle- related deaths, more than two-thirds of bicycle-related hospital admissions and about one-third of hospital emergency room visits for bicycling injuries. The single most effective safety device available to reduce head injury and death from bicycle crashes is a helmet. Helmet use reduces the risk of bicycle- related death and injury and the severity of head injury when a crash occurs. Unfortunately, national estimates report that bicycle helmet use among child bicyclists ranges from 15 to 25 percent. Helmet usage is lowest (for all ages) among children ages 11 to 14 (11 percent). Bicycle education programs and mandatory bicycle helmet legislation are effective at increasing helmet use and, therefore, reducing bicycle-related death and injury. DEATH$ AND INJURIES In 1997, 225 children ages 14 and under died in bicycle-related crashes. Motor vehicles were involved in more than 200 of these deaths. In 1998, nearly 362,000 children ages 14 and under were treated in hospital emergency rooms for bicycle-related injuries. In 1998, children ages 14 and under accounted for approximately 28 percent of bicyclists injured in motor vehicle crashes. It is estimated that collisions with motor vehicles account for nearly 90 percent of all bicycle-related deaths and 10 percent of all nonfatal bicycle-related injuries. Collision with a motor vehicle increases the risk of death, severity of injury, and the probability of sustaining a head injury. More than 40 percent of all head injury-related deaths and approximately three-fourths of head injuries occur among children ages 14 and under. Younger children suffer a higher proportion of head injuries than older children. WHEN AND WHERE BICYCLE DEATHS AND INJURIES OCCUR Children are more likely to die from bicycle crashes at non-intersection locations (66 percent), during the months of May to August (55 percent), and between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. (39 percent). Nearly 60 percent of all childhood bicycle-related deaths occur on minor roads. The typical bicycle/motor vehicle crash occurs within one mile of the bicyclist's home. Children ages 4 and under are more likely to be injured in non-street locations around the home (driveway, garage, yard) than are children ages 5 to 14. http ://www. safek ids. o rg/fact99/bike99, html 04/22/2000 bike-95-FS Page 2 of 4 Children ages 14 and under are nearly four times more likely to be injured riding in non-daylight hours (e.g., at dawn, dusk or night) than during the daytime. Among children ages 14 and under, more than 80 percent of bicycle-related fatalities are associated with the bicyclist's behavior including, riding into a street without stopping; turning left or swerving into traffic that is coming from behind; running a stop sign; and riding against the flow of traffic. Injuries related to the use of bicycle-mounted child seats typically occur when the bicycle crashes or tips over and when the child falls out of the seat. Falls account for 80 percent of these injuries. WI-IO IS A T RISK Riding without a bicycle helmet significantly increases the risk of sustaining a head injury in the event of a crash. Non-helmeted riders are 14 times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash than helmeted riders. Children under age 10 are at greater risk for serious injury and are more likely to suffer head injuries than older riders. Approximately half of all bicycle-related injuries among children under age 10 occur to the head/face, compared to one-fifth among older children. Bicyclists admitted to hospitals with head injuries are 20 times more likely to die than those without head injuries. Correct fit and proper positioning are essential to the effectiveness of bike helmets. One study found that children whose helmets fit poorly are at twice the risk of head injury in a crash compared to children whose helmet fit is excellent. In addition, children who wear their helmets tipped back on their head have a 52 percent greater risk of head injury than those who wear their helmets centered on their head. Children ages 14 and under are five times more likely to be injured in a bicycle-related crash than older riders. Males account for more than 80 percent of bicycle-related deaths and 75 percent of nonfatal injuries. Children ages 10 to 14, especially males, have the highest death rate from bicycle-related head injury of all ages. BICYCLE HELMET EFFECTIVENESS Bicycle helmets have been shown to reduce the risk of head injury by as much as 85 percent and the risk of brain injury by as much as 88 percent. Bicycle helmets have also been shown to offer substantial protection to the forehead and mid face. It is estimated that 75 percent of bicycle-rehted fatalities among children could be prevented with a bicycle helmet. Universal use of bicycle helmets by children ages 4 to 15 could prevent between 135 and 155 deaths, between 39,000 and 45,000 head injuries, and between 18,000 and 55,000 scalp and face injuries http://www.safekids.org/fact99/bike99.html 04/22/2000 bike-95-FS Page 3 of 4 annually. Child helmet ownership and use increases with income and educational level, yet decreases with age. Children are more likely to wear a bicycle helmet if riding with others (peers or adults) who are also wea~ng one. BICYCLE HELMET LA WS AND REGULATIONS Currently, 16 states and numerous localities have enacted some form of bicycle helmet legislation, most of which cover only young riders. Various studies have shown bicycle helmet legislation to be effective at increasing bicycle helmet use and reducing bicycle-related death and injury among children covered under the law. One example shows that five years following the passage of a state mandatory bicycle helmet law for children ages 13 and under, bicycle-related fatalities decreased by 60 percent. Helmet use among children is greater in those regions of the United States with the highest proportion of mandatory helmet laws. A recent study reported that the rate of bicycle helmet use by children ages 14 and under was 58 percent greater in a county with a fully comprehensive bike helmet law than in a similar county with a less comprehensive law. As of March 10, 1999, all new bicycle helmets manufactured must meet the new U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission federal safety standard. Helmets meeting American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the Snell Memorial Foundation and/or the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards are safe and may be available in stores until March 2002. HEAL TH CARE COSTS AND SA V1NGS The total annual cost of traffic-related bicyclist death and injury among children ages 14 and under is more than $3.4 billion. Every dollar spent on a bike helmet saves society $30 in direct medical costs and other costs to society. If 85 percent of all child cyclists wore bicycle helmets in one year, the lifetime medical cost savings could total between $109 million and $142 million. A review of hospital discharge data in Washington state found that treatment for nonfatal bicycle injuries among children ages 14 and under costs more than $113 million each year, an average of $218,000 per child. PREVENTION TIPS A bicycle helmet is a necessity, not an accessory. Always wear a bicycle helmet every time and everywhere you ride. Wear a bicycle helmet correctly. A bicycle helmet should fit comfortably and snugly, but not too tightly. It should sit on top of your head in a level position, and it should not rock forward and back http://www.safekids.org/fact99/bike99.html 04/22/2000 bike-95-FS Page 4 of 4 or from side to side. The helmet straps must always be buckled. Buy a bicycle helmet that meets or exceeds the safety standards developed by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission federal safety standard or those developed by ANSI, Snell or ASTM. Learn the rules of the road and obey all traffic laws. Ride on the right side of the road, with traffic, not against; use appropriate hand signals; respect traffic signals; stop at all stop signs and stop lights; and stop and look left, right and left again before entering a street. Cycling should be restricted to sidewalks and paths until a child is age 10 and able to show how well he or she rides and observes the basic rules of the road. Parental and adult supervision is essential until the traffic skills and judgment thresholds are reached by each child. 12/99 This information was compiled by the National SAFE KIDS Campaign. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/bike99.html 04/22/2000 Childhood injury citations Page 1 of 3 CHILDHOOD INJURY The unintentional injury-related death rate among children ages 14 and under declined 33 percent from 1987 to 1997. However, unintentional injury remains the leading cause of death among children ages 14 and under in the United States. In 1997, more than 6,040 children ages 14 and under died from unintentional injuries. In addition, each year nearly 120,000 children are permanently disabled. One out of every four children, or more than 14 million children ages 14 and under, sustains injuries that are serious enough to require medical attention each year. These injuries have enormous financial, emotional and social effects on not only the child and the family, but the community and society as a whole. In general, children are primarily at risk of unintentional injury-related death from: motor vehicle injuries which include children as occupants, pedestrians and bicyclists; drowning; fire poisonings. Injury rates vary with a child's age, gender, race and socioeconomic status. Younger children, males, minorities and poor children suffer disproportionately. Additionally, the causes and consequences of injuries vary considerably by age and developmental level, reflecting differences in children's cognitive, perceptual and motor/language abilities as well as environment and exposure to hazards. DEATHS In 1997, unintentional injuries resulted in the death of 736 children under age 1, 1,968 children ages 1 to 4, 1,514 children ages 5 to 9, and 1,824 children ages 10 to 14. Among children under age 1, suffocation is the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death, followed by motor vehicle occupant injury, choking, drowning and fire and burns. Among children ages 1 to 4, drowning is the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death, followed by motor vehicle occupant injury, fire and burns, pedestrian injury and airway obstruction injuries (choking and suffocation). Among children ages 5 to 9, motor vehicle occupant injury is the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death, followed by pedestrian injury, drowning, fire and burns and bicycle injury. Among children ages 10 to 14, motor vehicle occupant injury is the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death, followed by pedestrian injury, drowning, bicycle injury and fire and burns. XNJU ES Every day, more than 39,000 children are injured seriously enough to require medical treatment, totaling more than 14 million children each year. Each year, injuries to children ages 14 and under result in 213,000 hospitalizations, nearly 7,900,000 emergency room visits, and more than 11,000,000 visits to physicians' offices. Among children ages 14 and under, treatment for injury is the second leading cause of hospitalization and the leading cause of visits to hospital emergency departments. http://www, safekids.org/fact99/child99.html 04/22/2000 Childhood injury citations Page 2 of 3 WHEN AND WHERE DEATHS AND INJURIES OCCUR The majority of childhood injuries occur between May and August. * The vast majority of unintentional injury-related deaths among children occur in the evening hours when children are most likely to be out of school and unsupervised. Among children ages 14 and under, it is esdrnated that 40 percent of deaths and 50 percent of nonfatal unintentional injuries occur in and around the home. WHO IS A T RISK Unintentional injuries disproportionately affect poor children and result in more fatalities in these children than children with greater economic resources. Children ages 4 and under are at greater risk of unintentional injury-related death and disability. This age group accounts for 46 percent of all unintentional injury-related deaths among children ages 14 and under. Through virtually all ages, for all causes of injury, males are at greater risk of unintentional death and injury than females. This is primarily due to greater exposure to activities that result in injury and patterns of risk taking and rough play. Children living in rural areas are at greater risk from unintentional injury-related death than children riving in urban areas. Injuries in rural settings occur in remote, sparsely populated areas that tend to lack organized systems of trauma care, resulting in prolonged response and transport times. A short supply of medical facilities, equipment and personnel to treat injuries in rural areas also contribute to this increased risk. Black, Hispanic and Native American children have disproportionate death and injury rates primarily due to higher levels of poverty and lower levels of education, employment and income. HEALTH CARE COSTS AND SAVINGS Injury is the leading cause of medical spending for children ages 5 to 14. Among children ages 14 and under, fails account for the largest share of unintentional injury-related costs -- nearly 21 percent -- followed by motor vehicle occupant injuries, pedestrian injuries, drownings, poisonings and fire and burn injuries. The annual lifetime cost of unintentional injury among children ages 14 and under is nearly $175 billion, which includes $10.1 billion in direct medical costs, $16.9 billion in future earnings and $148 billion in quality of life. For every child injured, total costs are more than $12,700, including $650 in medical costs, more than $1,000 in future earnings lost and nearly $11,000 in quality of life. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/child99.html 04/22/2000 Childhood injury citations Page 3 of 3 Every dollar spent on a child safety seat saves this country $32 in direct medical costs and other costs to society. Every dollar spent on a bicycle helmet saves this country $30 in direct medical costs and other costs to society. Every dollar spent on a smoke alarm saves this country $21 in direct medical costs and other costs to society. Every dollar spent on poison control centers saves this country $7 in medical costs. PREVENTION EFFECTIVENESS It is estimated that as many as 90 percent of unintentional injuries can be prevented. A combination of education, environmental improvements, engineering modifications, enactment and enforcement of legislation and regulations, economic incentives, community empowerment and program evaluation are effective at reducing the incidence and severity of unintentional injury-related death and disability. 12/99 This information was compiled by the National SAFE KIDS 4 UNINTENTIONAL FIREARM INJURY The death rate from unintentional firearm injury among children ages 14 and under declined 49 percent from 1987 to 1997. However, unintentional shootings account for more than 20 percent of all firearm- related fatalities among children ages 14 and under, compared with 3 percent for the entire U.S. population. Americans possess nearly 200 million firearms, including 65 million handguns. An estimated 40 percent of all homes in the United States have some type of firearm, and one in four homes has a handgun. Gun owners keep firearms in the home for hunting and recreation (60 percent) or for protection and crime prevention (40 percent). Guns in the home for protection are more likely to be handguns, found in a home with children, and stored loaded and unlocked. Exposure to guns and access to a loaded firearm increase the risk of unintentional firearm-related death and injury to children. Unrealistic perceptions of children's capabilities and behavioral tendencies with regard to guns are common. These include misunderstanding a child's ability to gain access to and fire a gun, distinguish between real and toy guns, make good judgments about handling a gun, and consistently follow rules about gun safety. Promoting the safe storage of firearms in the home and reducing their availability and accessibility are important steps in preventing unintentional firearm-related death and injury among children. AND L ]U S In 1997, 142 children ages 14 and under died from unintentional firearm-related injuries. Children ages 10 to 14 accounted for more than 85 percent of these deaths. Each year, an estimated 1,500 children ages 14 and under are treated in hospital emergency rooms for unintentional firearm-related injuries. Approximately 38 percent of these injuries are severe enough to require hospitalization. The unintentional firearm injury death rate among children ages 14 and under in the United States is nine times higher than in 25 other industrialized countries combined. In 1998, nearly 10,700 children ages 14 and under were treated in hospital emergency rooms for non-powder gun-related injuries (e.g., BB guns, pellet guns). WI-tEN AND WHERE FIREARM DEATHS AND INJURIES OCCUR Nearly all childhood unintentional shooting deaths occur in or around the home. Fifty percent occur in the home of the victim and nearly 40 percent occur in the home of a friend or relative. Firearm ownership in the home (especially a firearm kept loaded and unlocked) is associated with an increased risk of unintentional firearm fatalities among children. Owners of firearms in the home tend to be male, white, married, age 30 to 65, have higher incomes and educational levels, live in the South and the Midwest, in rural areas and have one to two children under the age of 18. Most childhood unintentional shooting deaths involve guns that have been kept loaded and accessible to children and occur when children play with loaded guns. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/firearm99.html 04/22/2000 Unintentional Firearm Page 2 of 4 One-third to one-half o f all firearm owners keep firearms loaded and ready for use at least some of the time. In one recent study of parents of children ages 4 to 12, more than half of gun-owning parents reported storing a firearm loaded or unlocked in their home. An estimated 3.3 million children in the United States live in households with firearms that are always or sometimes kept loaded and unlocked. Unintentional shootings among children most often occur when children are unsupervised and out of school. These shootings tend to occur in the late afternoon, peaking between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m., during the weekend, and during the summer months (June to August) and the holiday season (November to December). More than 70 percent of unintentional firearm shootings involve handguns. Rural areas have higher rates of firearm ownership and unintentional firearm-related injuries than urban and suburban areas. Shootings in rural areas are more likely to occur outdoors and with a shotgun or rifle, as opposed to indoors and with a handgun, as in urban areas. WHO IS A T RISK Male children are far more likely to be injured and die from unintentional firearm-related injuries than female children. Of those children ages 14 and under who are killed from unintentional shootings, more than 85 percent are male. Black children ages 14 and under have an unintentional shooting death rate that is more than twice thu of white children. Children living in the South are three times more likely to die from unintentional firearm-related injuries than those living in the Northeast. Children living in rural areas have higher death rates from unintentional firearm-related injuries. Nearly two-thirds of parents with school-age children who keep a gun in the home believe that the firearm is safe from their children. However, one study found that when a gun was in the home, 75 to 80 percent of first and second graders knew where the gun was kept. Generally, before age 8, few children can reliably distinguish between real and toy guns or fully understand the consequences of their actions. Children as young as age 3 are strong enough to pull the trigger of many of the handguns available in the U.S. FIRF_a4RM PREVENTION EFFECTIVENESS http://www.safekids.org/fact99/firearm99.html 04/22/2000 Unintentional Firearm Page 3 of 4 Two safety devices -- gun locks and load indicators -- could prevent more than 30 percent of all unintentional firearm deaths. Product design modifications can prevent unintentional firearm death and injury. Every unintentional shooting in which a child age 5 and under shot and killed himself or another could have been prevented by a safety device. FIREARM LA WS AND REGULATIONS Firearms are not federally regulated consumer products. However, in October 1997, Massachusetts became the first state to issue consumer product safety regulations for guns by establishing safety standards for all handguns made or sold in the state. Most gun laws in the United States target gun users, as opposed to firearm manufacturers. Currently, 17 states have enacted Child Access Prevention (CAP) laws, which may hold adults criminally liable for failure to either store loaded firearms in a place inaccessible to children or use safety devices to lock guns. State safe storage laws intended to prevent child access to guns have reduced unintentional firearm- related deaths among children ages 14 and under an average of 23 percent. Four states - Connecticut, Massachusetts, California and New Jersey - and several local jurisdictions have passed laws or ordinances requiting the provision of a gun lock with the purchase of every handgun. A national gun policy survey found that 68 percent of Americans endorse government regulation of the safety design of guns and 88 percent support laws requiring all new handguns be childproofed. HEAL TH CARE COSTS AND SAVINGS The total annual cost of unintentional firearm-related death and injury among children ages 14 and under is more than $3.7 billion. Children ages 5 to 14 account for more than $3.5 billion, or nearly 95 percent, of these COSTS. Among children ages 14 and under, unintentional firearm-related injuries account for half of the total cost of all firearm injuries, which include homicide, suicide and unintentional firearm injuries. Hospital treatment for a firearm-related injury averages between $7,000 and more than $15,000 per case. PREVENTION TIPS Children should not have access to firearms. A gun in the home is a danger to children. Parents should seriously weigh the risks of keeping a gun in the home. Gun owners should always store firearms unloaded and locked up, out of reach of children. Ammunition should be stored locked in a separate location, also out of reach of children. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/firearm99.html 04/22/2000 Unintentional Firearm Page 4 of 4 Safety devices such as gun locks, lock boxes or gun safes should be used for every gun kept in the home. Parents should talk to children about the dangers of guns, teach children to never touch or play with guns, and to tell an adult if they find a gun. Parents should check with neighbors, friends or relatives - or adults in any other homes where children may visit - to ensure they follow safe storage practices if firearms are in their homes. 12/99 This information was compiled by the National SAFE KIDS Campaign. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/firearm99.html 04/22/2000 Home Inury Page 1 of 3 i~~~iworld~3 towards injury-free schools [[ Home Injury Jl In Australia, on average 5, 000 children each day require medical treatment as a result on unintentional injury, 200 are admitted to hospital and 1 or 2 die.

Since the launch of the Campaign in 1988, America has witnessed a dramatic reduction in unintentional injury-related mortality. Although the Campaign cannot take sole credit for this decline, it has played a major role in generating activity at the national level and through its network of more than 280 State and Local SAFE KIDS Coalitions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. -UNINTENTIONAL INJUR Y-RELA TED DEATH RATES The unintentional injury death rate among children ages 14 and under declined more than 33 percent from 1987 to 1997. The motor vehicle occupant death rate among children ages 14 and under declined by 9 percent from 1987 to 1997. The bicycle injury death rate among children ages 14 and under declined by 48 percent from 1987 to 1997. The pedestrian injury death rate among children ages 14 and under declined by 42 percent from 1987 to 1997. The drowning death rate among children ages 14 and under declined by 37 percent from 1987 to 1997. The residential fire injury death rate among children ages 14 and under declined by 50 percent from 1987 to 1997. The airway obstruction injury death rate among children ages 14 and under declined by 15 percent from 1987 to 1997. The unintentional firearm injury death rate among children ages 14 and under declined by 49 percent from 1987 to 1997. The fall injury death rate among children ages 14 and under declined by 33 percent from 1987 to 1997. The poisoning death rate among children ages 14 and under declined by 27 percent from 1987 to 1997. INJURY PREVENTION EFFORTS ChiM Safety Seats More than 375,000 child safety seats have been distributed by State and Local SAFE KIDS Coalitions to families in need since the launch of the Campaign. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/trends99.html 4/11/00 Trends citations Page 2 of 2 Bicycle Helmets Sixteen states and numerous localities have enacted and/or strengthened some form of mandatory bicycle helmet legislation since the launch of the Campaign. More than 1 million bicycle helmets have been distributed by SAFE KIDS Coalitions since the launch of the Campaign. Bicycle helmet use among children in the United States ranges from 15 to 25 percent, as compar to one percent helmet usage when the Campaign launched its bicycle safety program in 1989. Fire And Burns More than 100,000 smoke alarms and batteries have been distributed by SAFE KIDS Coalitions since the launch of the Campaign's fire safety program in 1991. All national and regional code-making bodies have amended their plumbing code language to require anti-scald technology and a maximum water heater temperature of 120 degrees F in all newly constructed residenfikl units. * The first full year of funding for the Campaign began in 1988. Therefore, 1987 is used as benchmark data from which to establish trends. 12/99 This information was compiled by the National SAFE KIDS Campaign. http://www.safekids, org/fact99/trends99.html 4/11/00 minority FS Page 1 of 3 CHILDREN AT RISK Children are at significant risk from unintentional injury-related death and disability. Injury rates vary with a child's age, gender, race and socioeconomic status. Younger children, males, minorities and poor children suffer disproportionately. Poverty is the primary predictor of injury. Racial disparities in unintentional injury rates appear to have more to do with living in impoverished environments than with ethnicity. Strategies that reduce financial barriers to safety devices, increase education efforts, and improve the safety of the environment are effective at reducing death and injury among these populations at risk. LOW-INCOME CHILDREN Unintentional injuries disproportionately affect poor children and result in more fatalities compared with those children with greater economic resources. Children from low-income families are twice as likely to die in a motor vehicle crash, four times more likely to drown and five times more likely to die in a fire. Children ages 5 and under are more likely to live in poverty than any other age group. Nearly one out of every four (5.8 million) children ages 5 and under in the United States lives in poverty. Several factors common to low-income families may increase a child's risk of injury, including single-parent households, lack of education, young maternal age and multiple siblings. Children from low-income families live in more hazardous environments which may increase their risk of injury, including substandard and overcrowded housing, lack of safe recreational facilities, proximity of housing to busy streets, inadequate day care and/or supervision, increased exposure to physical-hazards and limited access to health care. Low-income families are less likely to use safety devices due to a lack of money, lack of transportation to obtain safety devices and/or a lack of control over housing conditions. MINORITY CHILDREN Minority children have higher poverty rates than white children. Black, Hispanic and Native American children have disproportionate death and injury rates due to higher levels of poverty and lower levels of education, employment and income. Minority children are more likely to lack health insurance; have more difficulty obtaining appropriate and necessary medical care; have lower incomes creating significant financial barriers to care; are more likely to receive care in hospital emergency rooms; are less likely to receive lifesaving preventive services; and practice fewer safety behaviors. Native American Children Among children ages 14 and under, Native American children have the highest unintentional injury death rate in the United States and are two times more likely to die from unintentional injury than white children. More than 40 percent of Native American children are poor - more than three times the poverty rate of white children. Factors that contribute to higher death and injury among Native American children are more strongly associated with economic conditions than culturally-based differences in parenting. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/at99.html 4/6/00 \"minority FS Page 2 of 3 Black Children Among children ages 14 and under, black children have the second highest unintentional injury death rate in the United States and are 1.7 times more likely to die from unintentional injury than white children. More than 45 percent of black children are poor; approximately four times the poverty rate of white children. In addition, only 39 percent of black children live with both parents. Hispanic Children Among children ages 1 to 14, Hispanic children have an unintentional injury death rate approximately equal to non-Hispanic children. More than 40 percent of Hispanic children are poor; having a poverty rate more than three times that of white children. RURAL AND URBAN CHILDREN Children living in rural areas are at significantly greater risk from unintentional injury-related death than children living in urban areas. These children are especially at risk from drowning, motor vehicle crashes, unintentional firearm injury, residential fires and agricultural work. Injuries in rural settings occur in remote, sparsely populated areas which tend to lack organized systems of trauma care, resulting in prolonged response and transport times. A short supply of medical facilities, equipment and-personnel to treat - injuries in rural areas also contribute to this increased risk. Minority children living in rural areas are especially at risk from unintentional injury-related death. These children represent a smaller percentage of the rural population and their specific needs are unlikely to be met. Higher death rates from unintentional injury in southern and mountain states reflect the high number of people living in rural communities. Higher injury fatality rates in rural communities are due in part to the high number of farm-related injuries. Children account for 20 percent of all injury-related farm fatalities and comprise an even larger portion of nonfatal injuries. Inner-city children are at greater risk from sustaining severe nonfatal injuries than suburban and rural children. Mortality rates, however, are lower, possibly due to better access to care because hospitals and trauma centers are in closer proximity. MALE CHILDREN At virtually all ages, for all causes of injury, males have significantly higher risk of death and injury than females. Males are at higher risk than females, mostly due to greater exposure to activities that result in injury and patterns of risk taking and rougher play. YOUNG CHILDREN http:Nwww.safekids.org/fact99/at99.html 4/6/00 minority FS Page 3 of 3 Children ages 4 and under are at greater risk from unintentional injury-related death and disability and account for 46 percent of these deaths among children ages 14 and under. Leading causes of unintentional injury-related death vary throughout childhood and are dependent upon a child's developmental abilities and exposure to potential hazards. The parent s perceptions of the child s abilities and injury risk also are factors. Injuries tend to occur when the demands of a task exceed the abilities of the child to safely complete the task. Infants have higher rates of unintentional injury-related death and are more likely to die or sustain nonfatal injuries, especially from suffocation and motor vehicle occupant injury, than older children. Preschoolers are developing motor skills but have poor impulse control and judgment. Their natural curiosity and lack of fear lead them into potentially dangerous situations. These children are more likely to die from drowning, fire and burn injury, motor vehicle occupant injury, pedestrian injury, choking and poisoning. 0 THER CHILDREN A T RISK Children with emotional or behavioral problems or who are inattentive or easily distracted tend to sustain more unintentional injuries than other children. Children with developmental disabilities, both physical and psychological, have higher rates of injury. 12/99 This information was compiled by the National SAFE KIDS Campaign. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/at99.html 4/6/00 home injury fact sheet Page 1 of 2 HOME INJURY Unintentional injury is the leading cause of death among children ages 14 and under. In 1997, more than 6,040 children died from unintentional injuries; more than 40 percent of these deaths occurred in and around the home. Home injury deaths are caused primarily by fire and burns, drowning, suffocation, choking, firearms, poisoning, and falls. Young children are at the greatest risk from unintentional injuries in the home because it is where they spend the majority of their time. As children grow older, they spend less time in the home and the incidence of home injury deaths diminishes. The percentage of non-fatal unintentional injuries that occur in the home also decreases with age. DEATHS IN THE HOME In 1998, approximately 1,900 children ages 14 and under diecl in the home from unintentional injuries. Nearly 70 percent of these deaths occurred among children ages 4 and under. Among the leading causes of death in the home are: Fire and Burns In 1998, approximately 550 children ages 14 and under died from fires and burns in the home. Of these children, 55 percent were ages 4 and under. Drowning In 1998, an estimated 440 children ages 14 and under drowned in or around the home. Of these children, 80 percent were ages 4 and under. Suffocation In 1998, an estimated 370 children ages 14 and under suffocated in the home. Of these children, more than 80 percent were ages 4 and under. Choking In 1998, more than 160 children ages 14 and under choked to death in the home. Of these children, three-quarters were ages 4 and under. Unintentional Firearm Injury In 1998, an estimated 80 children ages 14 and under died from unintentional shootings in the home. Of these children, three-quarters were ages 5 to 14. Poisoning In 1998, an estimated 80 children ages 14 and under died from poisonings in the home. Half of these deaths were due to solids and liquids such as medicines and cleaners; the remaining deaths were due to gases and vapors, principally carbon monoxide. Falls In 1998, an estimated 60 children ages 14 and under died as the result of falls in the home. Half of these deaths were to children ages 4 and under. INJURIES IN THE HOME http://www.safekids.org/fact99/home99.html 4/6/00 home injury fact sheet Page 2 of 2 Each year, more than 4.5 million children ages 14 and under are treated in hospital emergency departments (EDs) for injuries incurred in the home. Nearly two-thirds of the injuries requiring ED visits among children under age 3 occur in the home. Conversely, one-third of the injuries requiring ED visits among children ages 12-14 occur in the home. 12/99 This information was compiled by the National SAFE KIDS Campaign. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/home99.html 4/6/00 drowning F.S. Page 1 of 3 DROWNING The death rate from drowning among children ages 14 and under declined 37 percent from 1987 to 1997. However, drowning remains the second leading cause of unintentional injury-related death in this age group and the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death among children ages 1 to 4. The maiority of drownings and near-drownings occur in residential swimmingpools. However, children can drown in as little as one inch of water and are therefore at riskof drowning in wading pools, bathtubs, buckets, diaper pails, toilets, spas and hot tubs. Additionally, older children are more likely to drown in open water sites, such as lakes, rivers and oceans. Drowning usually occurs quickly and silently. Childhood drownings and near-drownings can happen in a matter of seconds and typically occur when a child is left unattended or during a brief lapse in supervision. Two minutes following submersion, a child will lose consciousness. Irreversible brain damage occurs after four to six minutes and determines the immediate and long- term survival of a child. The majority of children who survive are discovered within two minutes following submersion (92 percent), and most children who die are found after 10 minutes (86 percent). Nearly all who require cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) die or are left with severe orain injury. DEATHS AND INJURIES In 1997, nearly 1,000 children ages 14 and under drowned. Children ages 4 and under accounted for more than half of these deaths. Near-drownings have high case fatality rates. Fifteen percent of children admitted for near- drowning die in the hospital. As many as 20 percent of near-drowning survivors suffer severe, permanent neurological disability. For every child who drowns, an additional four are hospitalized for near-drowning and for every hospital admission, approximately four children are treated in hospital emergency rooms. WHEN AND WHERE DR O WNINGS AND NEAR-DR O WNINGS OCCUR More than half of drownings among infants (under age 1) occur in bathtubs. Drownings in this age group also occur in toilets and buckets. More than 85 percent of drownings among children ages 1 to 4 are pool-related. Children ages 5 to 14 most often drown in swimming pools and open water sites. More than 327 children, 89 percent between the ages of 7 and 15 months, have drowned in buckets containing water or other liquids used for mopping floors and other household chores since 1984. Approximately 10 percent of childhood drownings occur in bathtubs; and the majority of these occur in the absence of adult supervision. Among children ages 4 and under, there are approximately 375 residential swimming pool drownings and 2,900 near-drownings requiring hospital emergency room treatment each year. More than half of these drownings occur in the child's home pool and one-third at the homes of friends, neighbors or relatives. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/drown99.html 4/11/00 drowning F.S. Page 2 of 3 The majority of children who drown in swimming pools were last seen in the home, had been missing from sight for less than five minutes, and were in the care of one or both parents at the time of the drowning. In-ground swimming pools without complete four-sided isolation fencing are 60 percent more likely to be involved in drownings than those with four-sided isolation fencing. Since 1980, approximately 230 children ages 4 and under have drowned in spas and hot tubs. In 1998, 17 children ages 14 and under drowned in boating-related incidents. In 1998, more than 210 children ages 14 and under suffered personal watercraft-related injuries while on the water. Drownings and near-drownings tend to occur on Saturdays and Sundays (40 percent) and between the months of May and August (66 percent). Drowning fatality rates are higher in southern and western states than in other regions of the United States. Rural areas have higher death rates than urban or suburban areas, in part due to decreased access to emergency medical care. WHO IS A T RISK Children ages 4 and under have the highest drowning death rate, a rate two to three times ~ reater than othdr age groups, and account for 80percent of home drownings. These rownings typically occur ~n swimming pools andbathtubs. Male children have a drowning rate two to four times that of female children. However, females have a bathtub drowning rate twice the rate of males. Black children ages 14 and under have a drowning death rate that is two times greater than white children, in general and six times greater for drownin. . gs in buckets. However, white children ages 1 to 4 have a drowning death rate that Is twice that of black children, primarily from residential swimming pool drownings. Low-income children are at greater risk from non-swimming pool drownings. Among children hospitalized for near-drownings, prolonged submersion and time until resuscitative efforts are initiated, as well as hypothermia, are strongly associated with poor outcomes. DR OWNING PREVENTION EFFECTIVENESS Installation of four-sided isolation fencing, at least five feet high, equipped with self-closing and self-latching gates, could prevent 50 to 90 percent of childhood residential swimming pool drownings and near-drownings. Door alarms, pool alarms and automatic pool covers, when used correctly, can add an extra level of protecu'on. It is estimated that 85 percent of boating-related drownings could have been prevented if the victim had been wearin a ersonal flotation device (PFD) In 1998, less than one-fourth of the P , . children ages 14 and under who drowned m boating-related incidents were wearing PFDs. Educational efforts focused on PFDs and safe boating practices are effective in increasing PFD usage. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/drown99.html 4/11/00 drowning F.S. Page 3 of 3 WATER SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has developed voluntary guidelines, which include both education and labeling, to address the hazard of children drowning in five-gallon buckets. Three states (Arizona, California and Oregon) and many communities have enacted safety laws requiring fencing around residential swimming pools. At least 32 states have enacted boating safety laws requiring children to wear PFDs at all times when on boats or near open bodies of water. These laws vary in age requirements, exemptions and enforcement procedures. Recreational boats must carry one U.S. Coast Guard-approved PFD in good condition and the correct size for each person aboard. A properly sized PFD must be available, serviceable and accessible. HEALTH CARE COSTS AND SAVINGS Typical medical costs for a near-drowning victim can range from $75,000 for initial emergency room treatment to $180,000 a year for long-term care. The cost of a near-drowning that results i brain damage can be more than $4.5 million. The total annual cost of drownings and near-drownings among children ages 14 and under is approximately $6.2 billion. Children ages 4 and under account for $3.8 billion, or 61 percent, of these costs. PREVENTION TIPS Never leave a child unsupervised in or around water in the home. Empty all containers immediately after use and store out of reach. Never leave a child unsupervised in or around a swimming pool or spa, even for a moment. Never rely on a PFD or swimming lessons to protect a child. Learn CPR and keep rescue equipment, a telephone and emergency numbers poolside. Install four-sided isolation fencing, at least five feet high, equipped with self-closing and self- latchinggates, that completely surrounds swimming pools or spas and prevents direct access from a house and yard. Always wear a U.S. Coast Guard-approved PFD when on a boat, near open bodies of water or when participating, in. water sports. Air-filled. swimming aids, such as \"water wings,\" are not conslde dred safety evlces and are not subsututes for PFDs. Never dive in water less than nine feet deep. 12/99 This information was compiled by the National SAFE KIDS Campaign. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/drown99.html 4/11/00 mv occupant-FS Page 1 of 3 MOTOR VEHICLE OCCUPANT INJURY Motor vehicle crashes remain the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death among children ages 14 and under, despite a nine percent decline in the motor vehicle occupant death rate from 1987 to 1997. During the same time period, the motor vehicle occupant nonfatal injury rate among children has increased by four percent. Child safety seats and safety belts, when correctly installed and used, can prevent injury and save lives. It is estimated that 71 percent of children ages 4 and under are restrained while riding. Unrestrained children are more likely to be injured, to suffer more severe injuries, and to die in motor vehicle crashes than children who are restrained. DEATHS AND INJURIES In 1997, 1,775 child occupants ages 14 and under died in motor vehicle crashes. Children ages 4 and under accounted for 34 percent of these childhood motor vehicle occupant deaths. In 1998, more than 274,000 children ages 14 and under were injured as occupants in motor vehicle-related crashes. Children ages 4 and under accounted for nearly 30 percent of these childhood motor vehicle occupant injuries. Motor vehicle injuries can have long-lasting psychological effects. One study showed that 25 percent of children who suffered from traffic injuries and 15 percent of their parents were later diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder. As of November 1, 1999, 86 children have been killed by passenger air bags. More than 20 percent of these, deaths were among infants in rear-facin, g child safety seats in front of a passenger alrbag. More than 89 percent of all chddren killed by passenger airbags were either unrestrained or improperly restrained at the time of the crash. WHEN AND WHERE DEATHS AND INJURIES OCCUR Seventy-five percent of motor vehicle crashes occur within 25 miles of home. In addition, 60 percent of crashes occur on roads with posted speed limits of 40 mph or less. More than one-fifth of all traffic deaths among children ages 14 and under involve alcohol. Almost half of the children killed in alcohol-related crashes are passengers in vehicles with drunken drivers. Rural areas have higher motor vehicle crash incidence rates and death rates than urban areas. In addition, crashes in rural areas are more severe. WHO IS A T RISK Riding unrestrained is the greatest risk factor for death and injury among child occupants of motor vehicles. Approximately 29 percent of children ages 4 and under ride unrestrained, placing them at twice the risk of death and injury as those riding restrained. Among children ages 14 and under killed as occupants in motor vehicle crashes in 1998, 61 percent were not using safety restraints at the time of the collision. Misuse of child safety seats is widespread. It is estimated that approximately 85 percent of children who are placed in child safety seats and booster seats are improperly restrained. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/mv99.html 4/11/00 mv occupant-FS Page 2 of 3 Driver safety belt use is positively associated with child restraint use. In a study of car crashes, a restrained driver was found to be three times more likely to restrain a child. The back seat is the safest place for children to ride. It is estimated that children ages 12 and under are 36 percent less likely to die in a crash if seated in the rear seat of a passenger vehicle. It is estimated that one in four children ages 13 and under ride in the front passenger seat, many in front of passenger air bags. Children traveling with unbelted drivers, as the only passenger, and those ages six and over are more likely to be seated in front. Recent surveys indicate that children ages 3 to 6 years are increasingly riding unrestrained and improperly restrained in the front passenger seat. Nearly 60 percent of children killed by deploying air bags are in this age group. Male children ages 1 to 14 have a motor vehicle fatality rate nearly one and a half times that of female children. American Indian and Alaska Native children ages 14 and under have a motor vehicle occupant death rate three times that of white and black children. Restraint use is lower in rural areas and low-income communities. Lack of access to affordable child safety seats contributes to a lower usage rate among low-income families. However, 95 percent of low-income families who own a child safety seat use it. RESTRAINT SYSTEMS Child safety seats are extremely effective when correctly installed and used in passenger cars, reducing the risk of death by 71 percent for infants and by 54 percent for children ages 1 to 4, and reducing the need for hospitalization by 69 percent for children ages 4 and under. It is estimated that nearly 300 children ages 4 and under were saved as a result of child restraint use in 1998. If all child passengers ages 4 and under were restrained, it is estimated that an additional 173 lives could be saved and 20,000 injuries could be prevented annually. Adult safety belts do not adequately protect children ages 4 to 8 (about 40 to 80 pounds) from injury in a crash. Although car booster seats are the best way to protect them, only five percent of booster-age children are properly restrained in car booster seats. Safety restraints afford the greatest protection against ejection from a vehicle during a crash. Nearly three-quarters of occupants who are totally ejected from passenger vehicles during fatal crashes are killed. Air bags, combined with lap/shoulder safety belts, offer the most effective protection available today for adult passenger vehicle occupants. It is estimated that air bags have saved more than 3,700 lives since they were first introduced in the late 1980s. CHILD OCCUPANT PROTECTION AND SAFETY BELT USE LAWS All 50 states, the District of Columbia and all U.S. territories have child occupant protection laws which vary widely in their age requirements, exemptions, enforcement procedures and penalties. These laws typically cover only children ages 3 and under. A total of 49 states (New Hampshire is the exception), the District of Columbia and all U.S. territories have safety belt use laws in effect. Most of these laws cover front-seat occupants only http://www.safekids.org/fact99/mv99.html 4/11/00 mv occupant-FS Page 3 of 3 and mandate \"secondary\" enforcement, which means an officer may cite a driver for not wearing a safety belt only if the violator is initially stopped for another violation. Only 16 states and the District of Columbia currently have primary (standard) enforcement laws. States with primary laws average 15 percentagepoints higher in restraint usage rates than those with secondary laws as well as lower fatality anainjury rates. Child occupant protection and safety belt use laws are proven effective at increasing restraint use. Ninety percent of Americans favor stronger enforcement of laws that require all children to be buckled up. In 1999, a new federal standard went into effect resulting in the manufacture of most new child safety seats with a standard top tether that will snap into vehicle anchors on most new passenger cars. The tether system will allow the child seat to be fastened more securely to the vehicle seat. HEAL TH CARE COSTS AND SAVINGS The total annual cost of motor vehicle occupant-related death and injury exceeds $25.5 billion for all children ages 14 and under, and is nearly $7.8 billion among children ages 4 and under. Every dollar spent on a child safety seat saves this country $32. PREVENTION TIPS Always use child safety seats and/or safety belts correctly every time you ride. Restrain children ages 12 and under in a back seat. Infants, until at least 1 year old and at least 20 pounds, should be in rear-facing child safety seats. Never put a rear-facing infant or convertible safety seat in the front passenger seat of a vehicle with an active passenger air bag. Children over 1 year old and between 20 and 40 pounds should be in forward-facing child safety seats. In addition, children ages 4 to 8 (about 40 to 80pounds) should be in a car booster seat and restrained with lap/shoulder belt every time they ride. Read your child safety seat instruction manual and your motor vehicle owner's manual for directions on proper installation. Call the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Auto Safety Hotline, (888) 327- 4236, to inquire about any recalls or safety notices on your child safety seat. 12/99 This information was compiled by the National SAFE KIDS Campaign. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/mv99.html 4/11/00 airway obstruction fact sheet Page 1 of 3 AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION INJURY The airway obstruction injury death rate among children ages 14 and under declined 15 percent between 1987 and 1997. However, the airway obstruction injury death rate among children under age I has shown no decline in the past decade. Airway obstruction injury (suffocation, choking, and strangulation) ;s the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death among children in this age group. Theseinjuries occur when children are unable to breathe normally because food or objects block their internal airways (choking); materials block or cover their external airways (suffocation); or items become wrapped around their necks and interfere with breathing (strangulation). Children, especially those under age 3, are particularly vulnerable to airway obstruction death and injury due to the small size of their upper airways, their relative inexperience with chewing, and their natural tendency to put objects in their mouths. Additionally, infants' inability to llft their heads or extrtYate themselves from tight places puts them at greater risk. AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION DEATHS AND INJURIES In 1997, 659 children ages 14 and under died from airway obstruction injuries. Of these children, nearly 80 percent were ages 4 and under. In 1997, more than 470 children ages 14 and under died from suffocation, strangulation, and entrapment in household appliances and toy chests. Of these children, nearly two-thirds were under age 1 and more than 80 percent were ages 4 and under. In 1997, 185 children ages 14 and under died from choking (food and nonfood). Of these children, nearly 80 percent were ages 4 and under. In 1998, eight children ages 8 and under died from choking on a toy or toy part. Balloons were involved in half of these incidents. In addition, one child died from toy-related suffocation. These deaths account for nearly 65 percent of all toy-related fatalities. Approximately 5,000 children ages 14 and under are treated in hospital emergency rooms for aspirating and ingesting toys and toy parts each year. More than 75 percent of these children are ages 4 and under. WHEN AND WHERE AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION DEATHS AND INJURIES OCCUR The majority of childhood suffocations, strangulations and chokings occur in the home. Children are more likely to suffocate during the summer months and choke during the winter months. Suffocation Sixty percent of infant suffocation occurs in the sleeping environment. Infants can suffocate when their faces become wedged against or buried in a mattress, pillow, infant cushion or other soft bedding, or when someone in the same bed rolls over onto them. Infants can also suffocate when their mouths and noses are covered by or pressed against a plastic bag. Children can suffocate when they become trapped in household appliances, such as refrigerators or dryers, and toy chests. Each year, cribs are involved in more than 70 percent of all nursery product-related deaths among infants. Cribs are responsible for about 40 strangulation and suffocation deaths each year (primarily older, used cribs). It is estimated that as many as 900 infants whose deaths are attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) ea year are found in potentially suffocating environments, frequently on their stomachs, with their noses and mouths covered by soft bedding. Choking The majority of childhood choking injuries and deaths are associated with food items. Children are at risk from choking on small, round foods such as hot dogs, candies, nuts, grapes, carrots and popcorn. Nonfood items tend to be round or conforming objects, including coins, small balls and balloons. Balloons are the most common cause of toy-related choking death among children. Unlike other causes of choking death, balloon-related deaths are as common among children ages 3 and older as among younger children. http ://www.safekids.org/fact99/ao9 9.html 4/11/00 airway obstruction fact sheet Page 2 of 3 Strangulation Strangulation occurs among children when consumer products become wrapped around their necks. Common items include clothing drawstrings, ribbons or other decorations, necklaces, pacifier strings, and window blind and drapery cords. Since 1981, more than 350 children have strangled on window covering cords. The majority of deaths occurred when the cord was hanging near the floor or crib, or when furniture was placed near the cord. Nearly 95 percent of these children were ages 3 and under. Since 1985, 22 children have died and at least 48 were injured from entangled children's clothing drawstrings, most often the hood/neck drawstrings. In addition, more than half of drawstring entanglement incidents involved playground slides. Children strangle in openings that permit the passage of their bodies, yet are too small for, and entrap, their heads. These include spaces in bunk beds, cribs, playground equipment, baby strollers, carriages and high chairs. Since 1990, at least 57 children, nearly all ages 3 and under, have died due to entrapment in bunk beds alone. WHO IS A T RISK Children ages 4 and under, especially under age 1, are at greatest risk for all forms of airway obstruction injury. Male, low-income and non-white children are at increased risk from suffocation, choking and strangulation. Black infants are more likely than white infants to be placed to sleep on their stomachs and on softer bedding. Children placed in adult beds are at increased risk for airway obstruction injury. Since 1990, at least 121 children ages 2 and under have died in adult beds from smothering as a result of being overlain by another person. Additionally, 296 children in this age group died in adult beds as a result of entrapment in the bed-structure. AIR WAY OBSTRUCTION PREVENTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS The Child Safety Protection Act requires choking hazard warning labels on packaging for small balls, balloons, marbles, and certain toys and games having small parts that are intended for use by children ages 3 to 6. This Act also bans any toy intended for use by children under age 3 that may pose a choking, aspiration or ingestion hazard. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has issued voluntary guidelines for drawstrings on children's clothing to prevent children from strangling in the neck and waist drawstrings of upper outerwear garments, such asjackets and sweatshirts. The CPSC has combined voluntary standards development with mandatory regulations to prevent an estimated 200 crib-related deaths among young children each year. In 1999, the CPSC voted to issue a mandatory standard for bunk beds to address entrapment hazards. The new standard will restrict opening sizes and require company identification and age-specific warning labeling on all new bunk beds. HEAL TH CARE COS TS AND SAVINGS The total annual cost of airway obstruction injury among children ages 14 and under exceeds $1.5 billion. Children ages 4 and under account for more than 60 percent of these costs. PREVENTION TIPS Place infants on their backs on a firm, fiat crib mattress in a crib that meets national safety standards -- look for a Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association certification label. Remove pillows, comforters, toys and other soft products from the crib. Always supervise young children while they are eating and playing. Do not allow children under age 6 to eat round or hard foods like peanuts and other nuts, raw carrots, popcorn, seeds, or hard candy. Children under age 6 should not eat hot dogs or grapes unless the skin is removed and the food is chopped !nto small, non-round pieces. Keep small items such as coins, safety pins, jewelry and buttons out of children s reach. Learn First Aid and CPR. Consider purchasing a small parts tester to determine whether or not small toys and objects in your home may present a choking hazard to ~roung children. Ensure that children play with age-appropriate toys according to safety labels. Inspect old ant1 new toys regularly for damage. Make any necessary repairs or discard damaged toys. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/ao99.html 4/1 1/00 'airway obstruction fact sheet Page 3 of 3 Remove hood and neck drawstrings from all children's outerwear. To prevent strangulation, never allow children to wear necklaces, purses, scarves or clothing with drawstrings while on playgrounds. Tie up all window blind and drapery cords or cut the ends and retrofit with safety tassels. Never hang anything on or above a crib with string or ribbon longer than seven inches. Do not allow children under age 6 to sleep on the top bunk of a bunk bed. Ensure that all spaces between the guardrail and bed frame and all spaces in the head and foot boards are less than 3.5 inches. 12/99 This information was compiled by the National SAFE KIDS Campaign. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/ao99.html 4/11/00 falls fact sheet Page 1 of 3 SCHOOL INJURIES More than 53 million children in the United States spend almost one-fourth of their total waking ho in school or on school property. An estimated 10 to 25 percent of the more than 14 million unintentional injuries sustained by children ages 14 an under each year occur in and around schools. Annually, one in 14 students suffers a medically attended or temporarily disabling injury at school. Public attention often focuses on school violence. However, studies indicate that school-age children are nine times more likely to sustain an unintentional injury than to be the victim of an intentional injury while at school. Playgrounds are associated with the majority of injuries among elementary school students. Athletics, including both physical education classes and organized sports, account for the majority of injuries among secondary school students. DEATHS AND INJURIES An estimated 2.2 million children ages 14 and under sustain school-related injuries each year. Eighty percent of elementary school students will see a school nurse for an injury-related compl over a two-year period. Approximately 715,000 sports- or recreation-related injuries occur in and around schools each y Approximately 13,000 playground equipment-related injuries occur on school playgrounds duri school hours. In 1998, 21 children ages 14 and under were killed and an estimated 6,000 were injured in school bus- related incidents. Sixty-two percent of the deaths were child pedestrians. WHEN AND WHERE SCHOOL DEATHS AND INJURIES OCCUR Playground-Related Injuries Playground injuries are the leading cause of injury among children ages 5 to 14 in the school environment. Nearly 40 percent of playground-related injuries occur during the months of May, June and September. More than 70 percent of playground equipment-related injuries involve falls to the surface and 9 percent involve falls onto equipment. Lack of supervision is associated with 40 percent of playground injuries. A recent study found that children play without adult supervision more often on school playgrounds (32 percent of the time) than on playgrounds in parks (22 percent) or child care centers (5 percent). Sports-Related Injuries The rate of injury per 1,000 students for students participating in organized school sports is mor than five times that of students participating in physical education classes. However, physical education classes account for a greater number of injuries than organized school sports. Among organized school sports, football has the highest injury rate, followed by basketball, baseball, wrestling and gymnastics. Most organized sports-related injuries (60 percent) occur dur practice rather than during games. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/schoo199.html 4/11/00 'falls fact sheet Page 2 of 3 The majority of organized sports injuries are from falls, collisions, being struck by an object or overexertion. Almost 75 percent of all school-related spinal cord injuries occur during sports activities. Scbool Bus-Related Injuries Ninety percent of students who are nonfatally injured in school bus-related incidents are injured occupants. Pedestrians account for almost three times as many school bus-related fatalities as bus occupants. Many injuries occur when children are boarding or exiting the school bus due to the driver's \"bl spot, which extends approximately 10 feet around the bus. Most school-age pedestrian deaths occur in the afternoon. Forty-one percent of the fatalities occ between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. WHO IS A T RISK Children ages 10 to 14 account for 46 percent of school-related injuries. Boys are three times more likely to sustain a school-related injury than girls. Half of all school-age pedestrians killed in school bus-related crashes are between the ages of 5 and 7. HEALTH CARE COSTS AND SAVINGS School-related injuries to children ages 14 and under result in an estimated $2 billion in medical spending each year. School bus-related injuries alone account for $21 million of these medical costs. The total annual cost of school-related injuries to children aged 14 and under exceeds $74 billion, which includes medical spending, quality of life lost and future earnings. PREVENTION TIPS Implement an annual school safety checklist and regularly maintain all equipment and facilities. Train school staff in emergency first aid and CPR. Playground Safety Avoid asphalt, concrete, grass and soil surfaces under playground equipment. Acceptable loose-fill materials include hardwood fiber mulch or chips, pea gravel, fine sand and shredded rubber. Surfacing should be maintained at a depth of 12 inches and should extend a minimum of 6 feet in all directions around stationary equipment. Rubber mats, synthetic turf and other artificial materials also are safe surfaces and require less maintenance. Always supervise children when using playground equipment. Prevent unsafe behaviors like pushing, shoving, crowding and inappropriate use of equipment. Ensure that children play on age-appropriate eqmpment. Sports Safety Make sure the following are included in any sports program: proper physical and psychological conditioning, use of appropriate safety equipment, a safe playing environment, http://www.safekids.org/fact99/schoo199.html 4/11/00 \"falls fact sheet Page 3 of 3 adequate adult supervision, and enforcement of safety rules. Match and group children according to developmentally appropriate skill level, weight and physical maturity, especially for contact sports. School Bus Safety Teach children to arrive at the bus stop early, wait for the bus to come to a complete stop before approaching the street, watch for cars, and avoid the driver's blind spot. Ensure that children stay seated at all times and keep their heads and arms inside the bus while riding. When exiting the bus, children should be taught to wait until the bus comes to a complete stop, then exit from the front using the handrail to avoid falls, and cross the street at least 10 feet in front of the bus. 12/99 This information was compiled by the National SAFE KIDS Campaign http://www.safekids.org/fact99/schoo199.html 4/11/00 falls fact sheet Page 1 of 3 PLAYGROUND INJURY Play is an essential component of healthy development in children, and playgrounds provide an opportunity for children to develop motor, cognitive, perceptual and social skills. All too often, however, playgrounds are the site of unintentional injuries. The leading cause of playground equipment-related fatalities is strangulation and the majority of these deaths occur on home playgrounds. This is contrasted with nonfatal playground equipment-related injuries which are most often due to falls. The majority of these nonfatal injuries take place on public playgrounds, including school, day care and parkplaygrounds. In a 1998 survey, U.S. playgrounds received an overall grade of C- when rated on physical hazards and behavioralelements, including supervision and age-appropriate design. It is the responsibility of adults to create play environments that are challenging for children, but that are also reasonably safe. Utilizing age-appropriate equipment, following a regular maintenance schedule, limiting equipment height and maintaining adequate surfacing, combined with adult supervision, can greatly reduce the incidence and seventy of such injuries. PLA YGR OUND DEATHS AND INJURIES Each year, nearly 20 children ages 14 and under die from playground equipment-related injuries. In 1998, more than 230,000 children ages 14 and under were treated in hospital emergency room for playground equipment-related injuries. Children ages 5 to 14 accounted for more than 70 per of these injuries. WHEN AND WHERE PLA YGR OUND DEATHS AND 1N/JURIES OCCUR It is estimated that one-third of playground equipment-related deaths and 70 percent of playground equipment-related injuries occur on public playgrounds. Playground injuries are the leading cause of injury to children in the day care setting and to children ages 5 to 14 in the school environment. Lack of supervision is associated with 40 percent of playground injuries. A recent study found that children play without adult supervision more often on school playgrounds (32 percent of the time) than on playgrounds in parks (22 percent) or child care centers (5 percent). Strangulation resulting from entanglement and entrapment is the primary cause of playground equipment-related fatalities, accounting for nearly half of the deaths. Falls to the surface are responsible for an additional 24 percent of the deaths. More than 70 percent of playground equipment-related injuries involve falls to the surface and 9 percent involve falls onto equipment. Falls account for 90 percent of the most severe playground equipment-related injuries (mostly head injuries and fractures). Head injuries are involved in 75 percent of all fall-related deaths associated with playground equipment. Nearly 40 percent of playground injuries occur during the months of May, June and September. Swings, climbing equipment and slides combined account for more than 85 percent of http://www.safekids.org/fact99/play99.html 4/6/00 falls fact sheet Page 2 of 3 playground-related injuries. WHO IS A T RISK Male children account for 62 percent of playground-related deaths and are at a slightly higher risk of nonfatal playground equipment-related injury compared with females. Children ages 4 and under are more likely to suffer injuries to the face and head while children ages 5 to 14 are more likely to suffer injuries to the arm and hand. ,, A young child is at increased risk of injury when playing on equipment designed for older children. Only 42 percent of U.S playgrounds have separate play areas for children ages 2 to 5 and.children ages 5 to 12, and only 9 percent have signs indicating the age appropriateness of e ul ment p. ~q~e risk of injury is four times greater if a child falls from playground equipment that is more than 1.5 meters (approximately 5 feet) high than from equipment that is less than 1.5 meters high. The risk of being injured in a fall onto a non-impact absorbing surface such as asphalt or concrete is more than twice that of fallin$ onto an impact-absorbingsurface. Only 62 percent of U..S. playgrounds have six feet zones ot appropriate impact-absorbing surfacing around stationary eqmpment. PLA YGR 0 UND INJURY PREVENTION EFFECTIVENESS Protective surfacing under and around playground equipment can reduce the severity of and even prevent playground fall-related injuries. PLA YGR 0 UND LA W'S AND REG ULA TIONS Playground equipment guidelines and standards have been developed by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), and the Consumer Federation of America. However, these are voluntary recommendations and are not federally mandated or regulated. At least four states -- California, Michigan, North Carolina and Texas -- have enacted playground safety legislation mandating many of these guidelines. The CPSC has issued voluntary guidelines for drawstrings on children's clothing to prevent children from strangling or ~etting entangled in the neck and waist drawstrings of outerwear garments, such as jackets anct sweatshirts. Children are at risk for strangulation when drawstrings on clothing become entangled in playground equipment. HEALTH CARE COSTS AND SAVINGS The total annual cost of playground equipment-related injuries among children ages 14 and under was estimated to be $1.2 billion in 1996. PREVENTION TIPS Avoid asphalt, concrete, grass and soil surfaces under playground equipment. Acceptable loose-fill materials include hardwood fiber mulch or chips, pea gravel, fine sand and shredded rubber. Surfacing should be maintained at a depth of 12 inches and should extend a minimum of 6 feet in all directions around stationary eqmpment. Rubber mats, synthetic turf and other http://www.safekids.org/fact99/play99.html 4/6/00 falls fact sheet Page 3 of 3 artificial materials also are safe surfaces and require less maintenance. Ensure that a comprehensive inspection of all playgrounds is conducted by qualified personnel. Abide by daily, monthly and annual playground maintenance schedules. Ensure that schools and child care centers have age-appropriate, well-maintained playground equipment, and that trained supervisors are present at all times when children are on the playground. Report any playground safety hazards to the organization responsible for the site (e.g., school, park authority, city council). Always supervise children when using playground equipment. Maintain visual and auditory contact. Prevent unsafe behaviors like pushing, shoving, crowding and inappropriate use of equipment. Ensure that children use age-appropriate playground equipment. Maintain separate play areas for children under age 5. Remove hood and neck drawstrings from all children's outerwear. Never allow children to wear necklaces, purses, scarves or clothing with drawstrings while on playgrounds. 12/99 This information was compiled by the National SAFE KIDS Campaign. http://www.safekids.org/fact99/play99.html 4/6/00 Childhood Unintentional Injury-Related Death Rate Drops by Nearly Half in Past Two De.. Page 1 of 2 Immediate Release Contact: Kate Milner, National SAFE KIDS 202-662-0600 Childhood Unintentional Injury-Related Death Rate Drops by Nearly Half in Past Two Decades New Report Shows Safety Devices Have Played a Key Role in Reducing Preventable Injuries to Kids (Washington, D.C.)According to a report by the National SAFE KIDS Campaign, safety devices such as smoke alarms, car seats and bike helmets have contributed to a 46 percent decline in the unintentional injury-related death rate among children ages 14 and under. As a result of better engineering, widespread education and improving safety devices over the past 20 years, children are better protected from preventable injury. The report chronicles important milestones in the evolution of safety devices such as their introduction into the market, the passage of landmark safety legislation, increased affordability and usage, and important innovations in materials such as plastics. \"Of all the dangers children face today, parents need to focus on the one that is not only the largest killer of kids, but the one they can do something about -unintentional injury,\" said Heather Paul, Ph.D., executive director of the National SAFE KIDS Campaign. \"The most effective proven intervention to protecting kids is the use of these safety devices. Safety device distribution and education have always been a core part of our mission, and it's gratifying to see injury death rates have declined as a result.\" Among the report findings: Over the past two decades, the residential fire-related death rate has declined 55 percent among children. Studies have shown that a working smoke alarm cuts the chances of dying in a residential fire in half. Smoke alarms in the early 1960s were metal devices that were prohibitively expensive at $120 each and not readily available to the public. Today, smoke alarms cost as little as $10 and are purchased at retail outlets in every community. While vehicle usage and miles traveled have soared over the past 18 years, the motor vehicle occupant-related death rate has declined by 10 percent among children. Car seats manufactured in the early 1970s provided comfort for kids riding in cars, but, ironically, offered little or no protection. Today, crash test standards exist that all car seats must meet. Correctly used, car seats can reduce the risk of death by as much as 71 percent for infants. Bike helmets are 88 percent effective in reducing the risk of brain injury and have contributed to a 60 percent decline in the death rate from bike-traffic injuries among children in the past two decades. Bike helmets were once merely a hairnet used only by professional racers. Now, bike helmets are made from protective polystyrene and fiberglass to absorb forces on impact and are used by both adults and children. In addition, 16 states now have bike helmet laws. While many factors have contributed to a decline in unintentional injury death rates, safety device usage, which has been greatly impacted by advances in technology has clearly made a difference. Materials such as fiberglass, nylon and polystyrene have helped to make safety devices more htto://www.safekids.or~/121699child.html 4/6/00 Childhood Unintentional Injury-Related Death Rate Drops by Nearly Half in Past Two De.. Page 2 of 2 accessible to the public by making them lighter, more affordable and more convenient to use. \"When you see the SAFE KIDS statistics, you realize that injuries happen a lot more than you think - and they are preventable,\" said Ron Yocum, president and CEO, American Plastics Council,. \"As a Grandfather, I marvel at the devices we never had when we were raising our kids. Just in the past 25 years we've seen tremendous advancements in the plastics technology that benefit children. We're confident that the role plastics play to improve safety devices will continue into the new millennium.\" Despite modem advances, unintentional injury remains the number one killer of children. However, new technologies, together with education and legislation, will continue to evolve as the public increasingly regards family safety as a high priority. The National SAFE KIDS Campaign is the first and only national organization dedicated solely to the prevention of unintentional childhood injury - the number one killer of children ages 14 and under. More than 2 75 state and local SAFE KIDS Coalitions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico comprise the Campaign. Former US. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, M.D., Sc.D., is chairman of the Campaign and Vice President A1 Gore and Tipper Gore are honorary chairs. http://www.safekids.org/121699child.html 4/6/00 The National SAFE KIDS Campaign Page 1 of 2 THE NATIONAL SAFE KIDS CAMPAIGN The National SAFE KIDS Campaign, the first national organization dedicated solely to the prevention of unintentional childhood injury, was launched in 1988 to address what was then a little recognized problem: More children under age 14 were being killed b~r what people call \"accidents (motor vehicle crashes, fires and other injuries) than 5y any other cause. The Campaign's founders believe there is no such thing as an accident and that unintentional injuries can be prevented. They enlisted the support ot corporations, government agencies and the health and safety community to reduce the inddence of childhood in)ury. Former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, M.D., Sc.D, came on board as chairman otthe Campaign and Vice President A1 Gore and Tipper Gore are honorary chairs. The Campaign's aim is to stimulate changes in attitudes, behavior, and the environment. From its inception, the Campaign has relied on developing injury prevention strate~gies that work in the real world -- conducting public outreach and awareness campaigns, stimulating hands-on grassroots activity and working to make injury prevention a public policy priority. This ongoing actionable strategy accounts for the tremendous progress the National SAFE KIDS Campaign has made. In the past decade the unintentional injury death rate among children 14 and under has declined by 33 percent. Injury Prevention Strategies The proven science of injury prevention and control underpins all Campaign initiatives. Decisions to foc- us on particular risk areas are data-driven -- based on death and injury rates and the availability of effective preventive interventions. A team of public health specialists endeavors to translate injury prevention research into multifaceted community-based strategies (e.g., SAFE KIDS CYCLE SMART, Project Get Alarmed, SAFE KIDS BUCKLE UP). These experts provide technical assistance to State and Local SAFE KIDS Coalitions to tailor, implement and evaluate these programs with one goal -- to prevent injuries and save lives. The Campaign has received awards from the Center for Disease Control and the American Public Health Association for outstanding services in the area of injury prevention practice and advocacy. Grassroots Outreach/SAFE KIDS Coalitions The Campaign relies on the support of more than 270 State and Local SAFE KIDS Coalitions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to reach out to local communities with prevention messages. These dedicated professionals and volunteers have distributed nearly 1 million bicycle helmets, 500,000 car seats and 100,000 smoke alarms to families in need. The Coalitions work closely with law enforcement officers, firefighters and paramedics, medical and health professionals, educators, parents, grandparents, businesses, public policy makers and, most importantly, kids. Public Awareness and Education A large part of prevention is educating parents, caregivers and children about the simple behavior modifications that can prevent needless tragedies. The National SAFE KIDS Campaign has been instrumental in getting vital safety messages to the public through low-cost or free educational materials includl~ng brochures, videos andposters. Thousands of national and local news stories air as a result of the Campaign and its Coalitio- ns' media efforts to raise widespread awareness of injury prevention and keep it foremost in the public mind. The Campaign's national media coverage includes broadcast stories on the nation s highest audience programs, including the Today Show, ABC World News Tonight, CNN news and NPR's \"All Things Considered.\" Print articles appear regularly in USA Today, Ladies'Home Journal and Parents magazines. The http://www.safekids.org/fact99/genera199.html 4/11/00 \"The National SAFE KIDS Campaign Page 2 of 2 Campaign has received the prestigious PRSA Silver Anvil award for its public education initiatives on three occasions. Public Policy The Campaign and its Coalitions rely on the help of policy-makers to institute child safety practices through effective laws. As a result of their efforts, federal, state and local lawmakers have aided children 8y passing and enforcing key safety legislation. Ten years ago, when the Campaign was founded, only one state had a bicycle helmet law. Today, 15 states and many communities require youngsters to strap on a helmet while biking -- and America now boasts a 40 percent reauction in the bicycle injury death rate. Additionally, the Campaign has helped pass, strengthen and enforce child occupant protection laws, smoke alarm laws and mandatory playground sa:[ety guidelines in communities across the country. The Consumer Product Safety Commission and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have honored SAFE KIDS for its injury prevention work. A Call To Action Despite recent advances, unintentional injury is still the number one killer of America's children, taking more lives than disease, violence and suicide. In 1996 alone, nearly 6,300 children died from unintentional injuries and each year more than 14 million children -- a stag, gerinl~ one out of four -- are injured seriously enough to require medical attention. Every one of these alarming statistics is somebody's child, which is why the National SAFE KIDS Campaign remains committed to reducing unintentional injury by driving prevention strategies and reinforcing public awareness of the prol~lem. 6/99 http://www.safekids.org/fact99/genera199.html 4/11/00 Injuries in the School Environment: Introduction Page 1 of 2 71 pupils were killed and 201 severely wounded in schools by handguns during the years 1986- 1989, according to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence. 175 pupils were killed in incidents involving school buses during that same period An additional 29,600 children suffered school bus-related injuries. More than half of the children killed were struck by the bus or another motor vehicle as they boarded or left the bus. While media reports sensationalize violence occurring in U.S. schools, the problem of unintentional injuries in the school setting has gone virtually unpublicized. Almost 22 million children in the United States are injured each year. An estimated 10 to 25 percent of these injuries occur in and around schools. Injuries are one of the most frequent conditions cared for by school health personnel. Over a two-year period, an estimated 80 percent of elementary school children will see a school nurse for injury-related complaints. Yet the problem of injuries in the school environment is often unrecognized, and consequently, preventive measures are neglected. Recent government initiatives to improve the health of children and adolescents have not addressed the safety of the school environment. For example, neither the problem statement nor the background papers for the National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives, Healthy People 2000, specifically mention injuries in the school setting. And although the National Education Goals call for schools to be free of violence by the year 2000, they do not recognize the importance of preventing unintentional injuries in order to create a safe environment for learning. Most relevant research in the medical and public health literature focuses on the underreporting of school injuries and the poor quality of data collected, rather than possible prevention measures. The education literature contains numerous references to safety but focuses primarily on liability in the school setting. Patterns and causes of school injuries are poorly understood, and resources to help public health and education professionals address injuries are scarce. Schools usually respond to injuries on an ad hoc basis--after the damage is done. Injury events are not consistently tracked, and it is often difficult to identify who has responsibility for preventing a recurrence. Currently, no comprehensive guidelines are available for school administrators and other health and education professionals interested in addressing the problem of injuries in the school environment. Thus, schools need to begin by assessing the causes of injuries within individual schools in order to target the leading causes of injury and to prevent them. A multifaceted intervention--including modifications to school equipment and facilities, development of supervision and safety policies, and education of students, teachers, parents, and administrators about injury prevention at school- provides the most comprehensive approach. State maternal and child health practitioners and other injury control experts can provide information and technical assistance to schools interested in developing and evaluating the impact of school-based injury prevention activities. Schools have an important role to play in addressing the problem of child and adolescent injuries. The Children's Safety Network has designed this packet to inform school personnel, injury prevention http://www.edc.org/HHD/csn/schoolinj/intro.html 4/6/00 injuries in the School Environment: Introduction Page 2 of 2 professionals, parents, and others about the extent of the problem of injuries in the school environment and to stimulate dialogue about possible solutions.

Yet serious injuries that happen on school grounds and result in hospitalization have not been well studied in the United States. The following facts were compiled from a descriptive analysis of the causes and outcomes of 1,558 cases reported to the National Pediatric Trauma Registry (NPTR).* Although this is not a population-based source of information, the data are useful in drawing attention to the problem of severe injuries in the school environment. School Injuries Overall The ratio of injury to males vs. females was 3:1. 46% of these incidents occurred among 10 to 14 year olds. 17% of those injured in school had a preexisting medical condition (e.g., physical or mental disability or chronic illness). 49% of the injuries happened in recreational areas, as opposed to the school building or other premises. The ratio of unintentional injuries to violence-related injuries was 9:1. Falls were the most frequent cause of injury (43%), followed by sports activities (34%) and assaults (10%). Other major causes of injury included being cut, striking against objects, and being struck by objects. Falls (N = 665) 53 falls were from a height greater than 8 feet, including 12 from windows, roofs, skylights, or balconies; other falls involved bleachers, stairs, and playground equipment. Falls accounted for 3 out of 8 deaths, 3 out of 11 cases requiring extensive rehabilitation, and 36% of cases with a high injury severity score. Sports (N = 524) A common scenario involved falling during a sports activity or being struck by a ball or another piece of sports equipment; injuries were related to asphalt surfaces, ruts in the playing field, bleachers, concrete gymnasium walls, and lack of protective equipment. http://www.edc.org/HHD/csn/schoolinj/unddata.html 4/6/00 Injuries in the School Environment: Understanding the Problem Page 2 of 4 Injuries occurred both in gymnasiums and on playing fields. Many kinds of sports were implicated, the most common being football, basketball, wrestling, soccer, track and field, and gymnastics. 75% of spinal cord injuries occurred during sports. Assaults (N = 160) Following falls and sports, assaults were the third most frequent cause of injury. Assaults included beatings (57%), gunshot wounds (10%), and stabbings (14%). The majority of the assaults (78%) occurred to students in grades 7-12. Severity Many school-related injuries result in hospitalization or surgery. 11% of children injured were in the intensive care unit for one day or longer. 35 children sustained a spinal cord injury. 39% had a head injury. 41% had one or more injuries to the extremities. One or more surgical interventions were required in 38% of school-related injuries. 8 children died, 6 from head injuries; 4 were unintentional injuries and 4 were assault-related. 44% of children were discharged with functional limitations expected to last less than 7 months, mainly due to fractures of the extremities; 2% were discharged with functional limitations expected to last 2 years or longer, caused by head or spinal cord injury. The average length of hospital stay was 3.5 days. Cost Assuming a conservative average cost of $1,000 per day, the cost ofhospitalization was more than $-5\" million for a total of 5,391 hospital days. School Triage Many school-related injuries were not treated immediately or appropriately. 248 children (16% of cases) were sent home after being injured and were subsequently admitted to a trauma center. http://www.edc.org/HHD/csn/schoolinj/unddata.html 4/6/00 lnjuries in the School Environment: Understanding the Problem Page 3 of 4 34% of those 248 children ended up in the operating room; 6% were admitted to the intensive care unit. Prevention A number of strategies can prevent unintentionaH~j~ies and violence ihthe school environment. Environmental Changes to Improve Physical Surroundings Removal of physical hazards (e.g., breakable glass in doors, concrete or asphalt under playground equipment, bleachers on playing field lines, holes or ruts in playing fields). Maintenance of equipment and facilities (e.g., protective guards on shop equipment, lockers anchored securely, playground equipment in good repair, working smoke detectors). Addition of safety features and equipment (e.g., padded mats on concrete gymnasium walls, use of mouthguards and other protective equipment, locks on roof doors, improved lighting). Institutionalization of an annual safety checklist for school premises. Policies and Regulations that Are Enforced Collection of injury data to identify causes and patterns of injury. Development and enforcement of schoolwide safety policies. Development of a response protocol for school staff in the event of an injury; emergency or disaster training for school staff. Enforcement of regulations, especially during sports and recreational activities. Modification of Behavior Education of students and staff regarding potential hazards and preventive measures, and what to do in the event of an emergency or disaster. Student Instruction in How to Play Safely Training of coaches, gym teachers, and other school staff in emergency first-aid procedures. Increased supervision of students. *National Pediatric Trauma Registry, October 1988-October 1995. Reports from 74 participating hospitals across the United States regarding children ages 0-19. N= 1,555 cases of injuries occurring in the school environment out of 49,540 total cases in the database. NPTR does not include cases of injuries on school grounds to children younger than 5 or older than 18, those that occurred during transportation to or from school, and those reported by a Canadian hospital. http://www.edc.org/HHD/csn/schoolinj/unddata.html 4/6/00 Injuries in the School Environment: New Hampshire Page 1 of 2 New Hampshire Safe Playground Project Elaine Frank The Injury Prevention Center Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center 7455 Butler Building, Room 8 Hanover, Nil 03755-3851 603.650.1780 ~ 603.650.1614 FAX The New Hampshire Safe Playground Project is designed to identify risks and strategies for reducing the number and severity of playground-related injuries in New Hampshire schools for grades K - 8. The project is funded by the New Hampshire Department of Education, Division of Educational Improvement, and managed by the Injury Prevention Center at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, in conjunction with the North Country Educational Foundation, a consortium of superintendents and school boards in the rural northern region of New Hampshire that provides training and technical assistance to teachers and administrators. The goal of the Safe Playground Project is to assist elementary school nurses and staff, school administrators, and insurers to systematically examine playground- and recreation-related injuries in order to develop effective prevention strategies to reduce risks. Data are collected for incidents that occur during school-sanctioned time, on the playground, or during recess or recreational activities, including physical education classes and school-sponsored sports. The data collection form is a modified version of the form developed in Arizona. Also reported are injuries that result in the loss of one half-day of school or more, students referred for outside medical care, and any other significant playground injury. The project is particularly interested in collecting data on injuries to students with special educational needs, to assess the incidence of playground injuries to this population. Beginning in October 1996, more than 65 schools began voluntary participation in the data collection effort. Schools provide completed injury reports for all incidents meeting the data collection criteria. Participating schools receive training for school nurses and designees related to the project, individualized reports detailing school-based injuries, access to and use of Playground Inspection Kits, ongoing technical assistance and updates on playground safety, and first-aid kits/fannypacks for use on playgrounds and on field trips. All training is provided by the staff of the Injury Prevention Center at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center. The project has produced six Playground Inspection Kits, located around the state and available for loan at no charge. The kits include materials that can assist schools and community groups to learn more about playground safety in general, as well as assess their own playgrounds. A resource library has been developed; it houses playground safety information that is available for loan to schools. http ://www.edc.org/HHD/csn/schoolinj/nh.html 4/6/00 Health: Safety/Recalls: CPSC and CNA Offer Free Home Childproofing Brochure Page 1 of 2 Fertility I ~ I Health I ~ I Fam,v I Fun m ~ I iMatemity.com I Expeas I Tools I Ch__~_~ I Boards I eXpeacting I ~~~~ Want to be baby? better parent?

Now that the chaos of the recent millennium celebration has passed, it's a good time to take a fresh look at the safety of your home. Use your common sense and the following checklist to help evaluate hom~ hazards and safeguard you and your family. Fan the flames of safety One of the most devastating disasters that can happen in a home is a fire. To starl minimizing your risk of having a fire, complete these basic home-safety tasks: Install working smoke alarms. Test them monthly, and replace the batteries twice a year, when you change your clocks. I;71 Plan and practice a fire escape route with your family. I;71 Fix potential fire hazards, such as frayed wires, wires under carpets, loose plugs and gas smells around pipes or appliances. Move candles away from combustibles, such as draperies or paper. I;71 Consider installing a sprinkler system. The National Fire Protection Association states that 90 percent of fires can be contained by the operation of just one sprinkler system. \"The installation of sprinkler systems in homes saves lives and property and should be increased at every opportunity,\" says Julie Reynolds, director of public affairs for the NFPA in Quincy, Mass. Be careful in the kitchen According to the NFPA, cooking equipment is the No. 1 cause of home fires. Never leave cooking equipment unattended, and keep your cooking area clean and uncluttered. Greasy or cluttered stove tops can lead to fires. Heed these othe kitchen safety suggestions. I;71 Hot soup on the stove top can fall and bum someone. Turn pan handles in. ~l Don't let children touch or get near hot items. 171 Always supervise children in your kitchen. Lock up cupboards and cabinets that contain detergents or other potentially harmful substances. Don't forget the garage Garages are usually filled with sharp tools, flammable liquids and motorized equipment. However, they're often overlooked when considering home safety. Keep these tips in mind when evaluating your garage. http ://www.nsc. org/pubs/fsh/archive/spr00/ho mcheck.htm 04/22/2000 NSC Family Safety & Health Home Safety Page 2 of 4 [] Lock up power tools and chemicals inside a cabinet. [] Store flammable materials, such as gasoline or oil-soaked rags, in appropriate containers. [] Keep hazardous substances, like weed killers, fertilizers or grease-removing solvents, locked in cabinets or out of children's reach. [] Always supervise children in your garage. [] Inspect your overhead garage door regularly. [] Keep the garage door down and locked at all times, even if you are inside the house or in the yard. [] Test the automatic reverse mechanism monthly. [] Keep the garage door remote controls away from children. [] Never try to \"beat the door\" by entering or exiting the garage beneath a moving garage door. Ensure safety in older homes Replete with charm and nostalgia, older homes unfortunately come with a host ol potential safety problems. The home-improvement editors at 4anything.corn, an Internet site that supplies information on various topics, offer this advice for improving safety in older homes. [] Visually inspect wood for rot or termite damage. [] Check for cold air drafts. [] Inspect all exposed plumbing for possible insulation trouble spots. In addition, owners of older homes can inexpensively improve their safety by doing one or all of the following: [] Install slip-resistant materials in the shower or tub. I;71 Add lighting where necessary. 1~ Update electrical outlets and switches. Reduce slips and trips Slips and trips aren't always a product of clumsiness. Many can be prevented by keeping these simple rules in mind. 171 Make sure all throw rugs have non-skid padding under them. I;71 Install handrails and slip-resistant floor coverings on staircases. [] Use a bath/shower mat near the bathtub or shower. [] Check outside for uneven ground. Level problem areas or mark them to prevent a fall. [] Apply an ice-melt product, salt, or sand to icy driveways, sidewalks and porches. Remove clutter Home safety includes getting rid of extra household \"stuff' and neatly storing http://www.nsc.org/pubs/fsh/archive/spr00/homcheck.htm 04/22/2000 NSC Family Safety & Health Home Safety Page 3 of 4 anything that's left over. Too many improperly stored items can be hazardous. Fo example, the potential for fire increases with each stack of old newspapers or paper grocery bags. Throw away what you don't need. 171 Store what you do need in filing cabinets, see-through plastic bins and desk and closet organizers. Prevent a pool tragedy From a child's perspective, swimming pools are excellent escapes on a warm day. However, from a parent's perspective, pools are potential hazards whenever a child is present. The key to pool safety lies primarily with competent adult supervision. Erect a barrier that, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, \"prevents a child from getting over, under or through, and keeps the child from gaining access to the pool except when supervising adults are present.\" Enforce the use of personal flotation devices. Be sure kids don't run around a pool. Don't allow kids to dive in shallow areas. Remember firearm safety Most tragedies, injuries or deaths from firearm-related incidents are preventable. The National Rifle Association suggests that adults should store guns so that the: are inaccessible to children and other unauthorized users. Store guns in a safe or ; locking gun cabinet, or use a device that renders the weapon unusable, such as a trigger lock. Offer these tips to kids if they find a gun: Stop! Don't Touch Leave the area. Tell an adult. Electrical safety At some point, a toddler may begin to get curious about the electrical outlets on the walls and may even wonder, \"What else can fit in those three holes?\" 121 Use outlet covers that prevent fingers, paper clips, pens and other objects from being \"plugged in.\" I~ Replace or repair frayed wires and cords. I~1 Unplug electrical appliances when not in use. Don't wait to fix something until after an incident occurs. Home safety should be on everyone's \"to do\" list. With the new year in full force, safeguard what matter, http://www.nsc.org/pubs/fsh/archive/spr00/homcheck.htm 04/22/2000 NSC Family Safety & Health Home Safety Page 4 of 4 most: you and your family.

Each year between 20 - 25% of all children sustain an injury sufficiently severe to require medical attention, missed school, and/or bed rest. 0 0 0 For every childhood death caused by injury, there are approximately 34 hospitalizations, 1000 emergency department visits, many more visits to private physicians and school nurses, and an even larger number of injuries treated at home. Deaths: Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death in children from 1-21 years of age. However, deaths are still a rare event. Even so, they are relatively easy to count accurately, given the sophisticated vital statistics surveillance system in the United States. These records are maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics, CDC Nonfatal: These are much less rare, but are more difficult to count accurately, since injured children are treated at so many types of sites by so many types of health care professionals. 1 Very few national surveillance systems exist for such data. The Department of Transportation (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) maintains the Fatal Accident Reporting System for fatal traffic-related events, and its companion General Estimates System to estimate the number of nonfatal traffic- related events. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission maintains the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to monitor hospital emergency department visits for product-related injuries. Too of Page Who is at-risk? Each type of injury has a particular demographic pattern, which is determined by: http :Hwww. cdc. gov/ncipc/fact sheets/childh, htm 0412212000 National Center for Injury Prevention and Control Page 2 of 4 Developmental level of the child: physical, mental, emotional Prevalence of the threat in that community (e.g., all-terrain vehicles backyard swimming pools, firearms, kerosene heaters, etc.) Access to and use of environmental countermeasures (e.g., bike helmets, smoke detectors) Importance of supervision in avoiding the threat, relative to the degree provided (e.g., toddler living in a low-income apartment complex with an in-ground swimming pool that lacks protective fencing, with a 5-year supervising the toddler) Several demographic features are common to most types of injuries. The injury rates are greatest in those with: Low socioeconomic status, especially urban African-American children and American Indians/Alaska Natives Males The principal exception to this is young motor vehicle occupants before adolescence, in whom the male:female ration is nearly unity. Top of Paqe What are the leading causes of fatal injuries Overall, motor vehicles, fires/burns, drowning, falls, poisoning. Top of Paqe What determines what body site(s) are injured? Injury-specific. For Motor vehicle--blunt thoracoabdominal sprains, and strains House fires--body bums, inhalation injuries Near-drowning--coma, brain damage Falls--head injuries, fractures, bhmt trauma Poisoning--coma, kidney failure, etc. Was the child a projectile? Head injury quite likely Bicycle-motor vehicle collision, falling forward over the handlebars Unrestrained occupant in a motor vehicle collision, thrown forward through the windshield or ejected from vehicle untc http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/childkhtm 04/22/2000 National Center for Injury Prevention and Control Page 3 of 4 roadway Top of Paqe A Where do injuries occur most commonly? Locations and conditions associated with possible danger are: In the home: Water--kitchen, bathroom, backyard swimming pool Intense heat or flames--kitchen, backyard barbecue pit Toxic agents--under the kitchen sink, bathroom medicine chest, mother's purse, garage High potential energy--stairwells, loaded firearms At school: Related to sports activities (especially in the absence of proper gear) Carrying of weapons Industrial arts classes After school: On the job: o Hostile relationships in work environment o Use of machinery During transport: o Motor vehicle crashes (especially if unrestrained or if driver has been drinking alcohol) o Bicycle crashes o Pedestrian injuries Top of Paqe What criteria determine the priority level for each type of childhood injury? High mortality rate or hospitalization rate High long-term disability rate, especially mechanisms likely to resul in head and spinal cord injuries Existence of effective countermeasure In other words, the highest priorities are assigned to those types of injuries which are common, severe, and readily preventable. http://www.cdc, gov/ncipc/factsheets/childh.htm 04/22/2000 National Center for Injury Prevention and Control Page 4 of 4 Contact Information National Center for Injury Prevention and Control Hailstop K63 however, the only difference between a nonfatal and fatal event is only a few feet (e.g., pedestrian injury which results in fracture rather than massive trauma), a few inches (gunshot wound to the arm instead of the head), or a few seconds (as inthe survivor of a near-drowning event). Therefore, each nonfatal event that involves a great mismatch of momentum must be taken very seriously. Surveillance of nonfatal injuries would be appropriate to help determine risk factors and possible interventions, as a proxy for fatal events.
