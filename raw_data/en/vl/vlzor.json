A B S T R A C T Background Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) can be symptomatic or asy mptomatic. Apart from chronic HBV infection, the complications related to acute HBV infection are severe acute viral hepatitis and fulminant hepatitis characterised by liver failure. The o ptimal pharmacological treatment of acute HBV infection remains contro versial. Objectives T o assess the benets and harms of pharmacological interventi ons in the treatment of acute HBV infection through a network me ta- analysis and to generate rankings of the available treatmen ts according to their safety and efcacy. As it was not possible to assess whether the potential effect modiers were similar across dif ferent comparisons, we did not perform the network meta-analy sis and instead assessed the benets and harms of different interve ntions using standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index E xpanded, WHO International Clinical T rials Registry Platfor m, and randomised clinical trials (RCTs) registers to August 2016 to identify RCTs on pharmacological interventions for acute HB V infection. Selection criteria RCTs, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication sta tus in participants with acute HBV infection. We excluded trials if participants had previously undergone liver transplantation and had oth er coexisting viral diseases such as hepatitis C virus and HIV. We considered any of the various pharmacological interventions compared wit h each other or with placebo, or no intervention. Data collection and analysis We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and rate ratio with 95% condence intervals (CI) using both xed-effect and random-effects models based on available-participant analysis with Review Manager 5. We assessed risk of bias, controlled risk of random errors w ith T rial Sequential Analysis, and assessed the quality of the eviden ce using GRADE. 1 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Main results Seven trials (597 participants) met our review inclusion criter ia. All trials provided information for one or more outcomes; however, ve participants were excluded from analysis by study authors . All the trials were at high risk of bias. Overall, all the evi dence was low or very low quality evidence because of risk of bias (downgraded one level for risk of bias), small sample size (downgraded one l evel for imprecision), and wide CIs (downgraded one more level for im precision in some comparisons). Of the seven trials, six were tw o- armed trials, while one trial was a three-armed trial. The comp arisons included hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) versus pl acebo (one trial; 55 participants); interferon versus placebo (two tri als; 200 participants); lamivudine versus placebo or ial; 90 participants); and entecavir versus no intervention (on e trial; 131 participants). One trial included only people with acute HBV wit h hepatic encephalopathy (i.e. people with fulminant liver fa ilure); one trial included only people with severe acute HBV, but it did not state whether any of the people also had fulminant HBV inf ection; three trials excluded fulminant HBV infection; and two trials did not report the severity of acute HBV infection. The mean or m edian follow-up period in the trials ranged from three to 12 months i n the trials that provided this information. There was no evidence of any differences in short-term mortalit y (less than one year) in any of the comparisons: HBIG versus pla cebo (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.54; participants = 55; 1 trial), lamivu dine versus placebo or no intervention (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.99; participants = 250; 2 trials); lamivudine versus ente cavir (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.13 to 11.65; participants = 90; 1 trial), o r entecavir versus no intervention (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.12 to 9.47; participants = 131; 1 trial). The proportion of people who prog ressed to chronic HBV infection was higher in the lamivudine group tha n the placebo or no intervention group (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.77; participants = 285; 3 trials) and in the lamivudine grou p versus entecavir group (OR 3.64, 95% CI 1.31 to 10.13; particip ants = 90; 1 trial). There was no evidence of a difference in the propor tion of people who progressed to chronic HBV infection between the entecavir and the no intervention groups (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0. 23 to 1.49; participants = 131; 1 trial). None of the trials repo rted progression to fulminant HBV infection. Three trials with 37 1 participants reported serious adverse events. There were n o serious adverse events in any of the groups The proportion of people with adverse events was higher i n the interferon group than the placebo group (OR 348.16, 95% CI 45.39 to 2670.26; participants = 200; 2 trials). There was no ev idence of a difference in the proportion of people with adverse events between the lamivudine group and the placebo or no interventi on group (OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.94; participants = 35; 1 trial ) or number of adverse events between the lamivudine group and the placebo or no intervention group (rate ratio 1.72, 95% CI 1. 01 to 2.91; participants = 35; 1 trial). One trial with 100 particip ants reported quality of life at one week. The scale used to rep ort the health-related quality of life was not stated and lacked infor mation on whether higher score meant better or worse, making i t difcult to interpret the results. None of the trials reported qualit y of life beyond one week or other clinical outcomes such as mortal ity beyond one year, liver transplantation, cirrhosis, decompensated ci rrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. T wo trials received funding from pharmaceutical companies; thr ee trials were funded by parties without any vested interest in the results or did not receive any special funding; the source of funding was not available in the remaining two trials. Authors' conclusions Low or very low quality evidence suggests that progression to chronic HBV infection was higher in people receiving lamivudin e compared with placebo, no intervention, or entecavir. Low qual ity evidence suggests that interferon may increase the advers e events after treatment for acute HBV infection. Based on a very low quality e vidence, there is currently no evidence of benet of any interve ntion in acute HBV infection. There is signicant uncertainty in the re sults and further RCTs are required. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Medical treatment of acute hepatitis B virus infection Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a virus that affects the liver. It is u sually transmitted by injectable drug abuse, transfusion of infected blood, unhygienic tattooing practices, coming into contact with blood i nfected with HBV, or by unprotected sex. Acute HBV infection is the period that covers the period immediately after HBV infect ion. Most people are asymptomatic. About 5% to 40% of people wi th develop symptoms such as jaundice (yellowish discolour ation of the eyes and skin), tummy pain, tiredness, nausea, an d vomiting. While most people clear the virus after acute HBV infe ction, the virus remains in others (chronic HBV infection) and cau ses major health problems (excessive tiredness and eventually ma y end with liver failure leading to vomiting blood, confusion , and death). 2 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Occasionally, people with acute HBV may develop immediate live r failure (fulminant HBV infection). The best way to treat acute HBV is not clear. We sought to resolve this issue by performing this review. We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) (cl inical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more t reatment groups) published to August 2016. We included only t rials in which participants with acute HBV infection had not undergone li ver transplantation previously and did not have liver disea se due to other viral infections. Apart from using standard Cochrane me thods which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time (di rect comparison), we planned to use an advanced method which allows com parison of the many different treatments individually which are compared in the trials (network meta-analysis). However, becaus e of the nature of the information available, we could not dete rmine whether the network meta-analysis results were reliable. So , we used standard Cochrane methodology. Study characteristics We identied seven RCTs. T rial authors included 592 (out of 597 randomised) participants in analyses. The trials included pe ople with acute HBV infection of varying severity. The main interventio ns included hepatitis B immunoglobulin (a vaccine), interferon (p rotein secreted in response to viral infection), and lamivudine and en tecavir (medicines) which are considered to have antiviral effect s and were compared with placebo or no intervention. The trials' ave rage follow-up period ranged from three months to one year in t he six trials that reported this information. T wo trials received funding from pharmaceutical companies; thr ee trials were funded by parties without any vested interest in the results or did not receive any special funding; two trials did not repor t the funding source. Quality of evidence The overall quality of evidence was low or very low, and all the trials were at high risk of bias (the likely possibility of mak ing wrong conclusions overestimating benets or underestimating harm s because of the way the studies were conducted is high). Key results There was no evidence of differences in death at less than one ye ar between any of the treated and untreated groups. The percen tage of people who progressed to chronic HBV infection was higher in lamivudine versus placebo or no intervention and lamivudine versus entecavir groups. There was no evidence of difference in the pro portion of people who progressed to chronic HBV infection betw een entecavir and no intervention. None of the trials reported pr ogression to fulminant HBV infection. There were no serious a dverse events in any of the treatment groups in the trials that repor ted this information. The percentage of people who developed adverse events was higher in the interferon group (100%) than in the pl acebo (dummy treatment) group (27%) in the trials that reported this information. There was no evidence of differences in the percen tage of people who developed adverse events or the total numb er of adverse events in the comparison between lamivudine versus n o treatment. One trial reported quality of life at one week; h owever, the information provided was insufcient to determine whether t here was any difference between the interferon and placebo gro ups. None of the trials reported quality of life beyond one week or othe r important outcomes such as death beyond one year, severe prog ressive liver damage, liver failure, requirement for liver transplantat ion, or liver cancer. There is currently no evidence of benet of a ny treatment in acute HBV infection. There is signicant uncertainty in the re sults and high-quality RCTs are required. 3 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a member of the Hepadnaviridae (hepa- totropic DNA virus) family, a family of viruses that infect li ver cells (Ganem 2004 ). Currently, 10 HBV genotypes (genotypes A are recognised ( Lin 2011 ;Tanwar 2012 ). The major mode of trans- mission of HBV is by parenteral routes, which include parenter al drug abuse, transfusion of infected blood, unhygienic tatto oing practices, and occupational exposure to the blood of people in- fected with HBV ( Wright 1993 ;Thompson 2009 ;Nelson 2011 ). The other major modes of transmission include sexual intercou rse with infected people and perinatal transmission from mother to child ( Wright 1993 ;Shi 2010 ;Deng 2012 ). The incubation period of HBV infection is about two to four weeks ( Tillmann 2014 ). In- fection with HBV is usually self-limiting and can be symptomati c (jaundice, abdominal pain, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting) in about 5% to 40% of people or asymptomatic ( 2013 ;Tillmann 2014 ). Acute HBV infection is usually followed by spontaneous clearance of the virus and long-lasting protection against reinfection ( Ganem 2004 ;Choi ). Acute infection can be difcult to distinguish from rst exacerbation of asymptomat ic chronic HBV, despite serological tests ( Kumar 2006 ). Apart from chronic HBV infection, the complications related to acute HBV infection are severe acute HBV and fulminant hepatitis charac- terised by liver failure. Severe acute HBV is variably dened as the presence of at least two of the following criteria: severe jaun dice (bilirubin levels higher than 10 171 \u00b5mol/L), interna - tional normalised ratio (INR; an expression of the blood's ab ility to clot) of 1.6 or greater, hepatic encephalopathy ( Bruno 2014 ), or the presence of levels along ele- ). Fulminant as INR and hepatic encepha lopa- thy (Tillmann 2014 ). In the US, approximately 3000 people developed acute HBV in- fection annually between 2010 and 2014, equating to about 1 in 100,000 population with highest rates in the 30- to 39-year ag e group and lowest rates in children and adolescents ( CDC 2014 ). The incidence is higher in men than women ( CDC 2014 ). The proportion of people with fulminant hepatitis after an a ttack of acute HBV can be variable, depending upon whether all people with acute HBV infection are included in the analysis (2% of peo- ple with acute HBV becoming fulminant) or whether only those people with severe acute HBV infection are included in the analy sis (4% to 5% of people with severe acute becoming (Leen 1989 ;Souza 2013 ;Coppola 2014 ). A signicant proportion of people with fulminant hepatitis B require liver transpla ntation or may die (varies from 18% to Leen 1989 ;Garfein 2004 ; Tillmann ). Overall, approximately 1% of people with acute HBV (of all severities) died ( CDC 2014 ).Less than 1% to 27% of people develop chronic HBV infection (persistence of acute HBV infection for more than six months) (Ganem 2004 ;McMahon 2014 ;Tillmann 2014 ). The risk of chronic HBV infection can be as high as 90% if the primary, acute HBV infection occurs at birth and 25% if it occurs between early infancy and ve years of age ( McMahon 2014 ). Later in life, the risk declines. Overall, in people with chronic HBV infectio n, about 13.5% develop cirrhosis ( Hoofnagle develop (symptomatic) year), or hepatocellular carcinoma (2% to 8% per year), or die (3% to 4% per year) ( Chu 2006 ). Description of the intervention Various drugs, interferon, and thymos in, have been used to prevent the complications of acute HBV in- fection and progression to chronic HBV infection ( Tillmann 2014 N-acetyl cysteine is an antioxidant that be administered or intravenou sly (Martindale 2011 ;Bass 2013 ). Ursodeoxycholic acid is a bile salt that is administered orally ( Lazaridis 2001 ;Martindale 2011 ). In- terferons are proteins secreted by cells in response to a wide r ange of inducers and that confer resistance against viruses and can- cer cells ( NCBI 2014a ). The acute HBV infection 1997 ). Interferon is usually manufactured by recom- binant technology where a sequence of human DNA is combined with the DNA of a bacteria such as Escherichia coli (Anonymous 1981 ). A variation of interferon-alpha is pegylated interferon- alpha, where the structure of interferon is modied to make it long acting ( Bailon 2001 ). Interferon-alpha is usually injections Martindale 2011 ). Thymosins are (or thymalfasin) recombinant technology and is ad- ministered subcutaneously ( Li 2010 ;Martindale 2011 ). It should be noted that these treatments have signicant complications i n- cluding severe infections, anaemia, neutropenia, nia, renal impairment, dal and suicidal ideas) ( Martindale 2011 ). Other complications include abdominal pain, elevation of liver enzymes, and myal gia (Martindale 2011 ). 6 Pharmacological interventions for acute B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.How the intervention might work Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues inhibit viral replicatio n by inhibiting reverse transcriptase (ribonucleic acid (RNA)-directe d DNA polymerase) in different ways ( Martindale 2011 ). N-Acetyl cysteine increases which is an antio xi- dant and protects the cells against oxidative stress. In addit ion, N- acetyl cysteine increases nitric oxide production resulting in va- sodilation and improved tissue oxygen delivery and uptake, and inhibits proinflammatory factors ( Bass 2013 ). Ursodeoxycholic acid decreases the exposure of liver cells to toxic bile salts an d has anti-inflammatory properties ( Bass 2013 ). This may decrease the damage to the liver cells. Interferon is one of the natural def ence mechanisms of the body against ;NCBI 2014a ). Interferons induce interferon-stimulated genes, which create s an antiviral state within the cells ( Feld 2005 ). Thymosins increase lymphocyte production and enhance the function of T cells ( Li 2010 ;NCBI 2014b ). Why it is important to do this review The current guidelines on the management of acute HBV infec- tion by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EAS L) recommends the following treatment ( EASL 2012 ). Entecavir or tenofovir should be used in people with acute severe HBV infec- tion or people with fulminant hepatitis. Antiviral therapy should be continued for at least three months after the appearance of a nti- HBs (antibody against HBsAg, the surface antigen of HBV) or at least 12 months after appearance of anti-HBe (antibody against HBeAg, a protein secreted by virus). However, the American As- sociation for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines r ec- ommend treatment only in people with fulminant hepatitis an d in people with protracted severe acute HBV infection ( AASLD 2009 ). Lamivudine and telbivudine may be used when the antic- ipated duration of treatment is short; otherwise, entecavir is the preferred treatment ( AASLD 2009 ). T reatment should be contin- ued until the clearance of HBsAg or indenitely in people un- dergoing liver transplantation AASLD 2009 ). Thus, the optimal management of people with acute HBV infection is not known. Network meta-analysis allows combining the direct evidence and indirect evidence and allows ranking of different treatments in terms of the different outcomes ( Salanti 2011 ;Salanti 2012 ). There has been no network meta-analysis on the pharmacologi- cal interventions used for treatment of acute HBV infection. Th is systematic review and attempted network meta-analysis inte nded to provide the best level of evidence for the role of different phar- macological interventions in the treatment of people with acut e HBV infection.O B J E C T I V E S T o assess the comparative benets and harms of different phar ma- cological interventions in the treatment of acute HBV infection through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of t he available pharmacological interventions according to their sa fety and efcacy. However, it was not possible to assess whether the po- tential effect modiers were similar across different compari sons. Therefore, we did not perform the network meta-analysis, and assessed the benets and harms of different interventions u sing standard Cochrane methodology. When more trials become available with adequate description of potential effect modiers, we will attempt to conduct network meta-analysis to generate rankings of the available interve ntions according to their safety and efcacy. This is why we retain the planned methodology for network meta-analysis in our Appendix 1. Once data appear allowing for the conduct of network meta- analysis, this Appendix 1 will be moved back into the Methods section. M E T H O D S Criteria for considering studies for this review T ypes of studies We considered only randomised clinical trials for this systema tic review irrespective of language, publication status, or date of pub- lication. We excluded studies of other designs because of the ri sk of bias in such studies. We are all aware that such exclusions mak e us focus much more on potential benets and not fully assess the risks of serious adverse events as well as risks of adverse ev ents. T ypes of participants We included participants with acute HBV infection irrespective o f the presence or absence of symptoms, severity of the HBV infec- tion, method of diagnosis of the disease, or HBV genotype. We ex- cluded participants who had undergone liver transplantation pre- viously. We also excluded participants who had HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), or hepatitis delta virus (HDV) coinfections, or acute exacerbations of chronic HBV infection. However, we included participants who did not undergo testing for viral coinfection s. T ypes of interventions We included any of the following pharmacological intervention s used either alone or in combination and could be compared with each other or with placebo or no intervention. Some of the pharmacological interventions that we considered were: 7 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. above list of interventions was not an exhaustive list. I f we identied any other pharmacological interventions that we we re not aware of (we included hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG)), we considered them eligible and included them in the review if they were used primarily for the treatment of acute HBV infecti on. T ypes of outcome measures We assessed the benets and harms of available pharmacologica l interventions aimed at treating people with acute HBV infecti on for the following outcomes. Primary outcomes Short-term mortality (up to one year). Progression to chronic HBV infection or to fulminant hepatitis HBV infection (in trials that included only participa nts without fulminant HBV infection). Adverse events (within three months of cessation of treatment). We dened a non-serious adverse event as any untoward medical occurrence not necessarily having a causal relationship with the treatment but resulting in a dose redu ction or discontinuation of treatment (any time after commencement of treatment) ( ICH-GCP 1997 ). We dened a serious adverse event as any event that would increase mortality; was life threatening; required hospitalisation; resulted signicant disability; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; or any important medical event that might have jeopardised the person or required intervention to prevent it. We planned to use the denition used by study authors for non-serious adverse events and serious adverse events: proportion of participants with serious adverse events; number of serious adverse events; proportion of participants with any type of adverse event; number of any type of adverse event. Health-related quality of life as dened in the included trials using a validated scale such as EQ-5D or 36-item Short Form (SF-36) ( EuroQol 2014 ;Ware 2014 ): short-term (up to one year);medium-term (one to ve years); long-term (beyond ve years). We considered short-term quality of life more important than medium-term or long-term quality of life, although medium-ter m or long-term quality of life are also important primary outcom es. Secondary outcomes Mortality: medium-term mortality (one to ve years) (proportion); time to death (maximal follow-up). Liver transplantation: proportion of participants with liver transplantation (for fulminant HBV time to liver transplantation of cirrhosis. Decompensated liver disease (maximal follow-up): proportion of participants with decompensated liver disease; time to liver decompensation. Proportion of participants with hepatocellular carcinoma (maximal follow-up). Potential surrogate outcomes (added post hoc) We have reported seroconversion which is sometimes used as a surrogate for progression to chronic HBV infection. Search methods for identication of studies Electronic searches We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled T rial s (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), and of Knowledge) ( Royle 2003 ) from inception to 11 August 2016 for randomised clinical tri- als comparing two or more of the above interventions (includ- ing placebo or no intervention) without applying any languag e restrictions. We searched for all possible comparisons formed by the interventions of interest. T o identify further ongoi ng or completed trials, we also searched the World Health Organiza- tion International Clinical T rials Registry Platform search por- tal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/ ), trial reg- ISRCTN andClinicalT rials.gov on 11 August 2016. Appendix 2 shows the search strategies that we used and the time spans of the searches. 8 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Searching other resources We searched the references of the identied trials and planned to search existing systematic reviews on acute HBV infection (we di d not nd any existing systematic reviews on this topic) to iden tify additional trials for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Selection of studies Three review authors (KM, MR, and KG) independently identi- ed the trials for inclusion by screening the titles and abstra cts. We sought full-text articles for any references that at least on e of the review authors identied for potential inclusion. We sel ected trials for inclusion based on the full-text articles. We have li sted the excluded full-text references with reasons for their exclus ion in the Characteristics of excluded studies table. We planned to list any ongoing trials identied primarily through the search of the clinical trial registers for further follow-up; however, we di d not nd any ongoing trials on the topic. We resolved discrepancies through discussion. Data extraction and management Three review authors (KM, MR, and KG) independently extracted the following data. Outcome data (for each outcome and for each treatment arm whenever applicable): number of participants randomised; number of participants included for the analysis; number of participants with events for binary outcomes, mean and standard deviation for continuous outcomes, number of events for count outcomes, and number of participants with events and mean follow-up period for time-to - event outcomes; denition of outcomes or scale used if appropriate. Data on potential confounding variables: participant characteristics such as age, sex, comorbidity, proportion of participants with asymptomatic o r mild acute HBV infection versus severe acute HBV infection or fulminant HBV infection, and proportion of participants with different HBV genotypes; details of the intervention and control (including dose, frequency, and duration); risk of bias (assessment of risk of bias in included studies). Other data: year and language of publication; country in which the participants were recruited; year(s) in which the trial was conducted; inclusion and exclusion criteria;follow-up time points of the outcome. If available, we planned to obtain the data separately for tr eatment- naive, non-responders, and relapsers from the report. If ava ilable, we also planned to obtain the data separately on participants with asymptomatic or mild acute HBV infection compared to severe acute HBV infection, or fulminant HBV infection, and partici- pants with different genotypes. We sought unclear or missing in- formation by attempting to contact the trial authors. If there was any doubt whether trials shared the same participants -- comple tely or partially (by identifying common authors and centres) -- we planned to attempt to contact the trial authors to clarify wheth er the trial report was duplicated; however, there were no such tr ials. We resolved any differences in opinion through discussion. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies We followed the guidance given in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011 ), and described in the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Module ( Gluud 2016 ), to assess the risk of bias in included studies. Specically, we assessed t he risk of bias in included trials for the following domains using the bias risk domains with denitions below ( Schulz 1995 sequence generation Low risk of bias: sequence generation was achieved using computer random number generation or a random number table. Drawing lots, tossing a coin, shuffling cards, and throw ing dice were adequate if performed by an independent person not otherwise involved in the trial. Unclear risk of bias: the method of sequence generation was not specied. High risk of bias: the sequence generation method was not random. Allocation concealment Low risk of bias: the participant allocations could not have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment. Allocation was controlled by a central and independent randomisation uni t. The allocation sequence was unknown to the investigators (e.g. if the allocation sequence was hidden in sequentially numbered, opaque, and sealed envelopes). Unclear risk of bias: the method used to conceal the allocation was not described so that intervention allocations may have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment. High risk of bias: the allocation sequence was likely to be known to the investigators who assigned the participants. 9 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Blinding of participants and personnel Low risk of bias: any of the following: no blinding or incomplete blinding, but the review authors judged that the outcome was not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; or blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, an d it was unlikely that the blinding could have been broken. Unclear risk of bias: any of the following: insufcient information to permit judgement of 'low risk' or 'high risk' ; or the trial did not address this outcome. High risk of bias: any of the following: no blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; or blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken, and the outcome was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding. Blinding of outcome assessors Low risk of bias: any of the following: no blinding of outcome assessment, but the review authors judged that the outcome measurement was not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; or blinding of outcome assessment ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken. Unclear risk of bias: any of the following: insufcient information to permit judgement of 'low risk' or 'high risk' ; or the trial did not address this outcome. High risk of bias: any of the following: no blinding of outcome assessment, and the outcome measurement was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; or blinding of outcome assessment, but likely that the blinding could have been brok en, and the outcome measurement was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding. Incomplete outcome data Low risk of bias: missing data were unlikely to make treatment effects depart from plausible values. Sufcient methods, such as multiple imputation, has been employed to handle missing data. Unclear risk of bias: there was insufcient information to assess whether missing data in combination with the method used to handle missing data were likely to induce bias on the results. High risk of bias: the results were likely to be biased due to missing data. Selective outcome reporting Low risk of bias: the trial reported at least short-term mortality, progression to chronic HBV infection, and treatme nt- related adverse events. If the original trial protocol was av ailable, the outcomes should have been those called for in that protocol. If the trial protocol was obtained from a trial registry (e.g.www.clinicaltrials.gov ), the outcomes sought should have been those enumerated in the original protocol if the trial protoco l was registered before or at the time that the trial was begun. If the trial protocol was registered after the trial was begun, t hose outcomes were not considered to be reliable. Unclear risk of bias: not all predened, or clinically relevant and reasonably expected, outcomes were reported fully, or it w as unclear whether data on these outcomes were recorded or not. High risk of bias: one or more predened or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were not reported, even though data on these outcomes were likely to have been available and even recorded. For-prot bias Low risk of bias: the trial appeared to be free of industry sponsorship or other type of for-prot support that may manipulate the trial design, conductance, or results of the tri al. Unclear risk of bias: the trial may or may not have been free of for-prot bias as no information on clinical trial support or sponsorship was provided. High risk of bias: the trial was sponsored by industry or received other type of for-prot support. Other bias Low risk of bias: the trial appeared to be free of other components (e.g. inappropriate control or dose or administration of control) that could put it at risk of bias. Unclear risk of bias: the trial may or may not have been free of other components that could put it at risk of bias. High risk of bias: there are other factors in the trial that could put it at risk of bias (e.g. inappropriate control or dose o r administration of control). We considered a trial at low risk of bias if we assessed the tria l to be at low risk of bias across all the above domains. Otherwis e, we considered trials at unclear risk of bias or at high risk of bi as regarding one or more of the above domains at high risk of bias . Measures of treatment effect For dichotomous variables (e.g. short-term and medium-term mortality, liver transplantation, progression to chronic H BV, pro- portion of participants with adverse events, decompensated l iver disease, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma), we calculated t he odds ratio (OR) with 95% condence intervals (CI). For contin- uous variables (e.g. quality of life reported on the same scale ), we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. We planned to use standardised mean difference values with 95% CI for quali ty of life if included trials used different scales. For count outco mes (e.g. number of adverse events), we calculated the rate ratio wit h 95% CI. For time-to-event data (e.g. mortality at maximal follo w- 10 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.up or requirement for liver transplantation, time to liver d ecom- pensation, and time to cirrhosis), we planned to use the hazard ratio with 95% CIs. We also calculated T rial Sequential Analys is- adjusted CI to control random errors ( Thorlund 2011 ;Wetterslev 2017 ). Unit of analysis issues The unit of analysis was people with acute HBV infection accord- ing to the intervention group to which they were randomly as- signed. Cluster randomised clinical trials We found no cluster randomised clinical trials. However, if we found such trials, we planned to include these, provided that t he effect estimate adjusted for cluster correlation was availabl e. Cross-over randomised clinical trials As expected, we found no cross-over randomised clinical trials. However, if we had identied any, we planned to only include th e outcomes after the period of rst treatment to avoid a potenti ally residual effect (the carryover effect) from the treatment admin is- tered during the rst period. Trials with multiple intervention groups We collected data for all trial intervention groups that met th e inclusion criteria. Dealing with missing data We performed an intention-to-treat analysis whenever possib le (Newell 1992 ). Otherwise, we used the data that were available to us (e.g. a trial may have reported only 'per-protocol' analys is results). As such per-protocol analyses may be biased, we planne d to conduct best-worst case scenario (good outcome (e.g. no mor- tality) in intervention group and bad outcome (e.g. mortality ) in control group) and worst-best case scenario (bad outcome (e.g. mortality) in intervention group and good outcome (e.g. no mor - tality) in control group) analyses as sensitivity analyses w henever possible. For continuous outcomes, we planned to impute the standard de- viation from P values according to guidance given in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011 ). If the data were likely to be normally distributed, we planned t o use the median for meta-analysis when the mean was not available. If it was not possible to calculate the standard deviation from th e P value or the CIs, we planned to impute the standard deviation us- ing the largest standard deviation in other trials for that o utcome. This form of imputation may decrease the weight of the study fo r calculation of MDs and may bias the effect estimate to no effect for calculation of standardised mean differences ( Higgins 2011 ).Assessment of heterogeneity We assessed clinical and methodological heterogeneity by caref ully examining the characteristics and design of included trials. We as- sessed or planned to assess the presence of clinical heterogene ity by comparing effect estimates in participants with asymptomatic or mild acute HBV infection compared to severe acute infec- tion or fulminant HBV infection, different HBV genotypes, an d the different regimens (e.g. different doses and different d urations) of the pharmacological interventions. Different study desig ns and risk of bias may contribute to methodological heterogeneity. We used the I2test and Chi2test for heterogeneity, and overlapping of CIs to assess heterogeneity. Assessment of reporting biases We planned to use visual asymmetry on a funnel plot to explore reporting bias in the presence of at least 10 trials that could b e included for a direct comparison ( Egger 1997 ;Macaskill 2001 ). In the presence of heterogeneity that could be explained by subgr oup analysis, we planned to produce a funnel plot for each subgroup in the presence of the adequate number of trials. We planned to use the linear regression approach described by Egger 1997 to determine the funnel plot asymmetry. We also considered selective reporting as evidence of reportin g bias. Data synthesis We performed the meta-analyses according to the recommenda- tions of Cochrane ( Higgins 2011 ), using the software package Re- view Manager 5 ( RevMan 2014 ). We used a random-effects and a xed-effect model ( DeMets 1987 ). In the case of a discrepancy between the two models, we reported both results; otherwise, we reported only the results from t he xed- effect model. Calculation of required information size and Trial Sequent ial Analysis For calculation of the required information size, see Appendix 3. We performed T rial Sequential Analysis to control the risks of random errors when there were at least two trials included i n the meta-analysis ( Wetterslev 2008 ;Thorlund 2011 ;TSA 2011 ; Wetterslev 2017 ). We used an alpha error as per guidance of Jakobsen 2014 , power of 90% (beta error of 10%), a relative risk reduction of 20%, a control group proportion observed in the trials, and the diversity observed in the meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity We planned to assess the differences in the effect estimates be tween the following subgroups. 11 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.T rials with low risk of bias compared to trials with high risk of bias. Asymptomatic or mild acute HBV infection compared to severe acute HBV infection or fulminant HBV infection. Different HBV genotypes. Different regimens (different doses and different duration s) of pharmacological interventions. We planned to use the Chi2test for subgroup differences to identify subgroup differences. Sensitivity analysis If a trial reported only per-protocol analysis results, we pla nned to re-analyse the results using the best-worst case scenario and worst-best case scenario analyses as sensitivity analyses whe never possible. Presentation of results and GRADE assessments We reported all the primary outcomes in a 'Summary of ndings' table format for comparisons with at least two trials, downgr ading the quality of evidence for risk of bias, inconsistency, indire ctness, imprecision, and publication bias using GRADE ( Guyatt 2011 ). One review author (KG) created the 'Summary of ndings' table.R E S U L T S Description of studies Results of the search We identied 2676 references through electronic searches of CE N- TRAL (n = 238), MEDLINE (n = 1786), Embase (n = 310), Science Citation Index Expanded (n = 322), World Health Or- ganization International Clinical T rials Registry Platfor m (n = 10), and ClinicalT rials.gov trials registers (n = 10). After the re- moval of 446 duplicates we obtained 2230 references. We then excluded 2215 clearly irrelevant references through screening titles and reading abstracts. We retrieved 15 references for further assess- ment. No references were identied through scanning reference lists of the identied randomised trials. We excluded seven r efer- ences for the reasons listed in Characteristics of excluded studies table ( Gregory 1976 ;Blum 1977 ;Botero 1991 ;Flisiak 2000 ; Sharapov 2000 ;Tillmann 2006 ;Yu 2010 ). In total, seven trials (eight references) met the inclusion criteria ( Anonymous 1974 ; Tassopoulos 1989 ;Tassopoulos 1997 ;Apostolescu 2001 ;Kumar 2007 ;Wiegand 2014 ;Streinu-Cercel 2016 ). The reference flow is summarised in the study flow diagram ( Figure 1 ). 12 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

HBV: hepatitis B virus; RCT: ran domised clinical trial. 13 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Included studies The seven trials included 597 participants ( Anonymous 1974 ; Tassopoulos 1989 ;Tassopoulos 1997 ;Apostolescu 2001 ;Kumar 2007 ;Wiegand 2014 ;Streinu-Cercel 2016 ). In these seven trials, 597 participants were randomised and data on one or more out- comes were available for 592 participants. One trial was a thre e- armed trial which compared lamivudine, entecavir, and no inter - vention ( Streinu-Cercel 2016 ). The remaining six trials were two- armed trials ( Anonymous 1974 ;Tassopoulos 1989 ;Tassopoulos 1997 ;Apostolescu 2001 ;Kumar 2007 ;Wiegand 2014 ). The de- tails of intervention, control, and the period of follow-up, a nd the risk of bias in the trials arranged according to intervention a nd control is summarised in Table 1 . One trial (55 participants) com- pared HBIG versus placebo ( Anonymous 1974 ). T wo trials (200 participants) compared interferon versus placebo ( Tassopoulos 1989 ;Tassopoulos 1997 ). Four trials (316 participants) com- pared lamivudine versus placebo or no intervention ( Apostolescu 2001 ;Kumar 2007 ;Wiegand 2014 ;Streinu-Cercel 2016 (90 participants) compared lamivudine versus entecavir (Streinu-Cercel 2016 ). One trial (131 participants) compared en- tecavir versus no intervention ( Streinu-Cercel 2016 ). Overall, ve trials used placebo as the 'no intervention' ( Anonymous 1974 ; Tassopoulos 1989 ;Tassopoulos 1997 2007 ;Wiegand 2014 ); the 'no intervention' (Apostolescu 2001 ;Streinu-Cercel 2016 ). The mean or median follow-up period in the trials ranged from three to 12 months i n the six trials that provided this information ( Tassopoulos 1989 ; Tassopoulos 1997 ;Apostolescu 2001 ;Kumar 2007 ;Wiegand 2014 ;Streinu-Cercel 2016 ). The mean or median age in the ve trials that reported this information ranged from 32 to 41 years ( Tassopoulos 1989 ; Tassopoulos 1997 ;Kumar 2007 ;Wiegand 2014 ;Streinu-Cercel 2016 ). The proportion of females in the trials that reported this information ranged from 14% to 54% ( Tassopoulos ;Wiegand 2014 ;Streinu-Cercel2016 ). One trial included only participants with acute HBV and hepatic encephalopathy (i.e. participants with fulminant liv er fail- ure;Anonymous 1974 ); one trial included only participants with severe acute HBV, but did not state whether it included fulmina nt HBV infection ( Streinu-Cercel 2016 ); three trials people fulminant HBV infection ( Tassopoulos 1989 ;Tassopoulos 1997 ;Wiegand 2014 ); two trials did not report the severity of acute HBV infection ( Apostolescu 2001 ;Kumar 2007 ). None of the trials reported the proportion of participants with diff erent HBV genotypes. Source of funding: two trials received nancial assistance from pharmaceutical companies who would benet from the ndings of the research or one of the authors was employed by a phar- maceutical company who would benet from the ndings of the research ( Tassopoulos 1989 ;Tassopoulos 1997 ); two trials did not report the source of funding ( Apostolescu 2001 ;Kumar 2007 ); three trials were funded by parties without any vested inter est in the results or did not receive any special funding ( Anonymous 1974 ;Wiegand 2014 ;Streinu-Cercel 2016 ).. Excluded studies We excluded seven references because they were quasi-randomise d studies (two references: Sharapov lack of conrmation of HBV infection in all participants (two ref- erences: Gregory 1976 ;Blum 1977 ), or because only four partic- ipants in the trial had acute HBV infection (three in interventi on group and one in control group) ( Botero 1991 ). Risk of bias in included studies The risk of bias in included trials is summarised in Figure 2 and Figure 3 . None of the trials were at low risk of bias and were at high risk of bias in one or more domains. So, all the trials wer e at high risk of bias. 14 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Allocation Three trials were at low risk of random sequence generation bi as (Anonymous 1974 ;Kumar 2007 ;Streinu-Cercel 2016 ). The re- maining trials were at unclear risk of random sequence generat ion bias ( Tassopoulos 1989 ;Tassopoulos 1997 ;Apostolescu 2001 ; Wiegand 2014 ). One trial was at low risk of allocation con- cealment bias ( Anonymous 1974 ). The remaining trials were at unclear risk of allocation concealment bias ( Tassopoulos 1989 ; Tassopoulos 2007 ;Wiegand 2014 ;Streinu-Cercel 2016 ). Blinding T wo trials were at low risk of bias due to lack of blinding of par tic- ipants, healthcare providers, and outcome assessors ( Tassopoulos 1997 ;Kumar 2007 ). One trial was at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding of participants, healthcare providers, and outcom e as- sessors ( Streinu-Cercel 2016 ). The remaining trials were at un- clear risk of bias due to lack of blinding of participants, healt hcare providers, and outcome assessors ( Anonymous 1974 ;Tassopoulos 1989 ;Apostolescu 2001 ;Wiegand 2014 ). Incomplete outcome data Three trials were at low risk of bias due to incomplete outcome d ata (Tassopoulos 1997 ;Kumar 2007 ;Streinu-Cercel 2016 ). One trial was at high risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data ( Wiegand 2014 ). The remaining trials were at unclear risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data ( Anonymous 1974 ;Tassopoulos 1989 ; Apostolescu 2001 ). Selective reporting None of the trials had a published protocol. T wo trials report ed mortality, adverse events, and progression to chronic HBV, a nd were at low risk of reporting bias ( Kumar 2007 ;Streinu-Cercel 2016 ). The remaining trials did not report these outcomes, which can be reasonably expected to be measured in trials in this eld ( Anonymous 1974 ;Tassopoulos 1989 ;Tassopoulos 1997 ; Apostolescu 2001 ;Wiegand 2014 ). So, these trials were at high risk of selecting outcome reporting. Other potential sources of bias Three trials were at low risk of vested interest bias ( Anonymous 1974 ;Wiegand 2014 ;Streinu-Cercel 2016 ); two trials were at high risk of vested interest bias ( Tassopoulos 1989 ;Tassopoulos 1997 ); the remaining trials were at unclear risk of vested interest bias ( Apostolescu 2001 ;Kumar 2007 ). All the trials were at low risk of other bias.Effects of interventions See:Summary of ndings for the main comparison Lamivudine versus no intervention for acute hepatitis B virus infection ; Summary of ndings 2 Interferon versus no intervention for acute hepatitis B virus infection Short-term mortality (up to one year) Three trials (326 participants) reported short-term mortalit y (Anonymous 1974 ;Kumar 2007 ;Streinu-Cercel 2016 ). There was no evidence of difference in short-term mortality in any of the comparisons ( Analysis 1.1 ). HBIG (19/27 55; 1 trial). Lamivudine (adjusted proportion: 4.3%) versus placebo or no intervention (5/150 (3.3%)) (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.33 = 90; 1 trial). Entecavir (1/21 (4.8%)) versus no intervention (5/110 (4.5%)) (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.12 to 9.47; participants = 131; 1 trial). Only one comparison had more than one trial (lamivudine versus placebo or no intervention). Even in this comparison, only one trial contributed to the analysis ( Streinu-Cercel 2016 ), as there were no events in either group in the other trial ( Kumar 2007 ). Therefore, heterogeneity was not assessed. Progression to chronic hepatitis B virus infection or to fulminant hepatitis B virus infection Three trials (306 participants) reported proportion of peopl e who continued to have HBsAg in serum ( Kumar 2007 ;Wiegand 2014 ; Streinu-Cercel 2016 ). The proportion of people who developed progression to chronic HBV infection was higher in the lamivu- dine group (adjusted proportion: 58.4%) versus the placebo or no intervention group (69/167 (41.3%)) (OR 1.99, 95% CI 3 0%) and the entecavir group (10/21 (47.6%)) (OR 3.64, 95% CI 1.31 to 10.13; participants = 90; 1 trial). There was no evidence of difference in the proportion of people who progressed to chronic HBV infection between the en- tecavir group (10/21 (47.6%)) versus the no intervention group (67/110 (60.9%)) (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.49; participants = 131; 1 trial) ( Analysis 1.2 ). There was no evidence of heterogeneity in the only comparison with more than one trial (lamivudine versus placebo or no in- tervention: I2= 0%). None of the trials reported progression to 17 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.fulminant hepatitis. Authors also reported seroconversion which was variably dened in the different trials (see 'Seroconvers ion (surrogate outcome)' below). As this is an unvalidated surrogat e outcome, we presented this information last and did not arriv e at conclusions based on this surrogate outcome. Adverse events Three trials (371 participants) reported serious adverse eve nts (Tassopoulos 1989 ;Kumar 2007 ;Streinu-Cercel 2016 ). There were no serious adverse events in any of the groups ( Analysis 1.3 ). Three trials (235 participants) reported proportion of peopl e with any adverse events ( Tassopoulos 1989 ;Tassopoulos 1997 ; Wiegand 2014 ). The proportion of people with adverse events was higher in the interferon group (adjusted proportion: 99. 2%) versus the placebo group (18/66 (27.3%)) 45.39 2 trials; low quality ev i- dence: downgraded by one level for risk of bias in the studies a nd one more level for small sample size) ( Analysis 1.4 ). There was no evidence of heterogeneity (I2= 0%; Chi2test for heterogeneity P = 1.00; good overlap of CIs). There was no evidence of dif- ference in the proportion of people with adverse events betwe en the lamivudine group (13/18 (72.2%)) versus the placebo or no intervention (11/17 (64.7%)) (OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.94; participants = 35; 1 trial) or the number of adverse events bet ween the lamivudine group (38/18 (211.1 events per 100 participants )) versus the no intervention group (21/17 (123.5 events per 100 participants)) (rate ratio 1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.91; participan ts = 35; 1 trial) ( Analysis 1.5 ). Health-related quality of life One trial (100 participants) reported health-related quality of life at one week ( Tassopoulos 1997 ). The scale used to report the health-related quality of life was not stated. Neither was in forma- tion on whether higher score meant better or worse available. The mean score in the placebo group was 42.7 units. The mean score in the interferon group was 5.4 units higher. There was no inf or- mation to calculate the 95% CIs or P value ( Analysis 1.6 ). None of the trials reported quality of life beyond one week. Mortality (beyond one year) None of the trials reported mortality beyond one year. Liver transplantation None of the trials reported the proportion of people who requ ired liver transplantation.Cirrhosis None of the trials reported the proportion of people who deve loped cirrhosis. Decompensated liver disease None of the trials reported the proportion of people who deve loped decompensated liver disease. Hepatocellular carcinoma None of the trials reported the proportion of people who deve loped hepatocellular carcinoma. Seroconversion (surrogate outcome) Five trials (437 participants) reported proportion of people who developed seroconversion ( Tassopoulos 1997 ;Apostolescu 2001 ). The deni- tion of seroconversion in the four trials that reported this i nfor- mation were: at 12 months ( Kumar 2007 ), hepatitis B surface antibody at 24 weeks ( Streinu-Cercel 2016 ), and hep- atitis B 10 U/L ( Wiegand 2014 ). The seroconversion proportions in the different comparisons were (Analysis 1.8 ): interferon (65/67 (97.0%)) versus placebo (33/33 (100.0%)) (OR 0.39, lamivudine (proportion: varied between 10.1% and 77.8%) versus placebo or no intervention (proportion varied between 22.7% and 85%) (OR varied between 0.27 and 2.63 (meta- analysis inappropriate because of variable denitions used for seroconversion and poor overlap of CI between effect estimate s between trials); participants = 0.96 to 6.74; participants = 131; 1 trial). Of the ve trials that reported the proportion of people who developed seroconversion, two trials (135 participants) repo rted the time taken to achieve seroconversion ( Tassopoulos 1997 ; Wiegand 2014 ). Of reported the standard devia- tion ( Tassopoulos 1997 ). There was no evidence of difference in the time taken to achieve seroconversion between interferon a nd placebo (MD -0.10 weeks, 95% CI -2.02 to 1.82; participants = 100; 1 trial) or between lamivudine and placebo or no interven - tion (MD 1.00 weeks, P = 0.519 (no details to calculate 95% CI); participants = 35; 1 trial) ( Analysis 1.8 ;Analysis 1.9 ). 18 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis We did not perform any of the subgroup analyses because none of the trials were at low risk of bias, the trials did not report t he data for different genotypes separately, and because there were t oo few trials to perform a meaningful subgroup analysis based on se verity of hepatitis B or dosage. Only one trial reported postrandom isation dropouts but did not report the group to which the participants belonged. Therefore, we did not perform a sensitivity analy sis. Since we did not impute mean or standard deviations, we did not perform a sensitivity analysis excluding trials in which mean or standard deviation were imputed.Reporting bias We did not explore reporting bias using funnel plot because of few trials included in the review. Trial Sequential Analysis We performed T rial Sequential Analysis for comparisons with two or more trials only (progression to chronic HBV infection: lami vu- dine versus placebo or no intervention and adverse events (pro - portion): interferon versus placebo). As shown in Figure 4 , the accrued sample size was only a small fraction of the diversity-ad - justed required information size (DARIS). The Z-curve did not cross trial sequential monitoring boundaries indicating tha t there was a high risk of random errors in these outcomes. 19 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Trial sequential analysis of progression to chron ic hepatitis B virus infection (lamivudine versus placebo or no treatment) and adverse events (proportion) (i nterferon versus placebo): Using the control group proportion observed in the trials (Pc = 41.3% and 34.9% respectively), alpha error of 2%, beta error of 90%, relative risk reduction (RRR) of 20%, and diversity obs erved in the analysis (0%), the accrued sample sizes (285 and 200 respectively) were only small proportions of th e diversity-adjusted required information sizes (DARIS) (progression to chronic hepatitis B = 1783; adverse events (proportion) = 2303). While the Z-curve (blue lines) crossed the conventional boundary of P = 0.05 (d otted green lines) favouring placebo or no treatment, it did not cross any of the trial sequential monit oring boundaries (dotted red lines). There was a high risk of random errors. 20 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.The T rial Sequential Analysis adjusted CIs were as follows. Progression to chronic HBV infection: lamivudine versus no intervention: 1.99 (95% placebo: 348.16 (95% CI 0.09 to 1,422,918.89). Quality of evidence The overall quality of evidence was very low for all outcomes un less indicated. The reason for downgrading was risk of bias in the t rials (one level), small sample size (one level), and wide CIs (one level ) (Summary of ndings for the main comparison ). 21 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.D I S C U S S I O N Summary of main results A total of 597 participants in seven trials were included in thi s re- view. A total of 592 participants in these seven trials contrib uted to one or more outcomes of this review. A total of ve interventio ns (four active interventions and one inactive intervention) wer e eval- uated in the seven trials included in this review. This include d in- terferon, HBIG, lamivudine, entecavir, and inactive interve ntion (placebo or no intervention). Overall, mortality at three months to one year following int er- vention in people with acute HBV infection was low (10/271 (3.7%)) ( Kumar 2007 ;Streinu-Cercel 2016 ), except in the one trial reported in 1970s, which included only people with fulmi - nant HBV infection ( Anonymous 1974 ). Mortality this trial was 69.1% (38/55) ( Anonymous 1974 ). There was no evidence of differences in mortality between different interventions r egardless of the severity of HBV infection. However, the sample size was very low to detect differences in mortality. Three trials repo rted the proportion of people who progressed to chronic HBV infec- tion (dened as persistence of HBsAg after six months). None of the interventions resulted in reduction in the proportion of people who progressed to chronic HBV infection compared to placebo or no intervention. None of the trials reported progression to ful- minant HBV infection either. None of the participants develop ed serious adverse events in the three trials that reported thi s infor- mation ( Tassopoulos 1989 ;Kumar 2007 ;Streinu-Cercel 2016 ). The proportion of people who developed adverse events (such as influenza-like symptoms and vomiting), was more in the inter- feron group than the placebo group. However, the trial sequen - tial monitoring boundaries were not crossed, suggesting tha t there may be random errors. There was no evidence of a difference in proportion of people who developed adverse events or the num ber of adverse events between lamivudine and placebo or no interv en- tion. Although one trial reported quality of life at one week , the information was not sufcient to understand whether there wa s a difference in quality of life between the two interventions com- pared in this trial (interferon versus placebo) ( Tassopoulos 1997 ). None of the trials reported the proportion of people who died during medium or long term (more than one year' follow-up); required liver transplantation; or developed cirrhosis, de compen- sated liver disease, or developed hepatocellular carcinoma. The trials reported seroconversion as a surrogate outcome for pro- gression to chronic HBV infection. The denition used in the tr i- als was variable, reflecting the problem with using lack of sero con- version as a surrogate marker for chronic HBV infection. In any case, the only comparison where there was evidence for differen ce was lamivudine versus entecavir: seroconversion was lower in peo- ple who received lamivudine compared with those who received entecavir. There was no evidence for differences in the time tak en for seroconversion in the trials that reported this informat ion.Overall completeness and applicability of evidence Overall, it appears that none of the interventions are bene cial for people with acute HBV infection. Considering that lamivudine or interferon do not offer any b en- et but have the potential to cause harm, it may be appropriate to test entecavir or other similar antiviral interventions s uch as tenofovir. We have included all the major interventions used for treating acute HBV infection that have been compared in ran- domised clinical trials in this review. The severity of acute HB V in- fection was variable across trials. In particular, only one tri al clearly indicated inclusion of fulminant HBV infection ( Anonymous 1974 ). Three trials HBV infection (Tassopoulos 1989 ;Tassopoulos 1997 ;Wiegand 2014 ). It was unclear whether any participants with fulminant HBV infection were included in the remaining trials ( Apostolescu 2001 ;Kumar 2007 ;Streinu-Cercel 2016 ). Considering that the main interven- tions that are currently recommended for treatment of acute HBV infection are antiviral drugs ( Tillmann 2012 ) (and there was no comparison of antiviral interventions versus no interventi on in people with fulminant HBV infection), the ndings of this revi ew are applicable only to people with acute HBV without fulminant liver failure. The ndings are also applicable only in adults with acute HBV infection, as none of the trials appeared to include children. The ndings are also applicable only in people who ha ve not undergone liver transplantation and those who do not hav e other coexisting viral diseases, since we did not consider tria ls con- ducted in these populations. Quality of the evidence The overall quality of evidence was low to very low for all the outcomes. All the trials were at high risk of bias for at least o ne of the domains as shown in Figure 2 andFigure 3 . The sample size was small for all the comparisons. There were also wide 95% CIs (the CIs overlapped 20% increase or decrease and minimal clini- cal important difference) for many of the comparisons. Moreove r, when we calculated T rial Sequential analysis-adjusted CI, the in- consistency exploded. There was insufcient information to as sess whether the diagnostic criteria for acute HBV and the severity of acute hepatitis HBV were similar across trials. In general, th ere was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity in most comparisons w ith the exception of the seroconversion in the comparison lamivudi ne versus placebo or no intervention, where there was moderate h et- erogeneity. Potential biases in the review process We followed the guidance of Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions with two review authors independently selecting studies and extracting data. We performed a thoroug h 24 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.search of literature. However, the search period included the p re- mandatory trial registration era and it is likely that some t rials on interventions that were not effective or were harmful were no t re- ported at all. We only included randomised clinical trials which are known to focus mostly on benets and do not collect and report harms in a detailed manner. According to our choice of studies (i.e. only randomised clinical trials), we might have missed a large numbe r of studies that address reporting of harms. Accordingly, this review is biased towards benets ignoring harms. We did not search fo r interventions and trials registered at regulatory authori ties (e.g. US Food and Drug Administration; European Medicines Agency, etc.). This may have overlooked trials and as such trials usuall y are unpublished, the lack of inclusion of such trials may make ou r comparisons look more advantageous than they really are. How - ever, this is of academic interest only because there is no evid ence of benet of any treatment in people with acute HBV infection (i.e. there is no reason to suggest that any of the interventio ns should be used in routine clinical practice regardless of the adv erse event prole of the intervention). We planned to perform a network meta-analysis. However, it wa s not possible to assess whether the potential effect modiers were similar across different comparisons. Performing a network m eta- analysis in this scenario can be misleading. So we did not perfo rm the network meta-analysis, and assessed the comparative bene - ts and harms of different interventions using standard Coch rane methodology. Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews This is the rst systematic review on the topic. Our review doe s not support the recommendations of EASL or the AASLD ( AASLD 2009 ;EASL 2012 ). This is probably because we have based our conclusions on randomised clinical trials. Information from no n- randomised studies is likely to provide biased effect estima tes, since the people who receive antiviral drugs are likely to differ si gni- cantly from those who do not receive antiviral drugs. A U T H O R S ' C O N C L U S I O N S Implications for practice Low or very low quality evidence suggests that progression to chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was higher in peoplereceiving lamivudine compared with placebo, no intervention, or entecavir. Low quality evidence suggests that interferon may in- crease the proportion of people who develop adverse events af ter treatment for acute HBV infection. Thus, there is a likelihood that reality is worse. Based on very low quality evidence, the re is currently no evidence of benet of any intervention in acute HBV infection. There is signicant uncertainty in this issue and fu rther randomised clinical trials are required. Implications for research Researchers should use clinical outcomes for research on this top ic. The trials should include placebo as one of the treatment arms s ince there has been no evidence from randomised clinical trials that any of the interventions are effective in improving clinical outcom es. Considering that lamivudine or interferon do not offer any b enet but have the potential to cause harm, it may be appropriate to t est entecavir or other similar antiviral interventions such as te nofovir against placebo. The participants should be followed up for at least one year and progression to chronic HBV infection should be one of the primary outcomes in such trials. In trials of peopl e with acute fulminant failure, mortality or requirement for l iver transplantation are suitable primary outcomes. The trials s hould be designed and reported using guidance from the SPIRIT stateme nt (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventiona l T rials; Chan 2013 ) and the CONSORT statement ( Schulz 2010 ).

A P P E N D I C E S Appendix 1. Methods for network meta-analysis if we nd this is pos sible in the future Measures of treatment effect Relative treatment effects For dichotomous variables (e.g. proportion of participants wi th serious adverse events or any adverse events), we will calcul ate the odds ratio with 95% credible interval (or Bayesian condence interva l) (Severini 1993 ). For continuous variables (e.g. quality of life reported on the same scale), we will calculate the mean difference with 95% cr edible interval. We will use standardised mean difference va lues with 95% credible interval for quality of life if included tria ls use different scales. For count outcomes (e.g. number of adver se events and serious adverse events), we will calculate the rate ratio wi th 95% credible interval. For time-to-event data (e.g. mortalit y at maximal follow-up), we will calculate hazard ratio with 95% credible inte rval. Relative ranking We will estimate the ranking probabilities for all treatmen ts of being at each possible rank for each intervention. Then, w e will obtain the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) (cumulativ e probability) and rankogram ( Salanti 2011 ;Chaimani 2013 ). Unit of analysis issues We will collect data for all trial treatment groups that meet th e inclusion criteria. The codes for analysis that we will use accou nt for the correlation between the effect sizes from trials with more than two groups. Assessment of heterogeneity We will assess clinical and methodological heterogeneity by car efully examining the characteristics and design of included tri als. We will assess the presence of clinical heterogeneity by comparing effect estimates under different categories of potential eff ect modiers. Different study designs and risk of bias may contribute to met hodological heterogeneity. 48 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.We will assess the statistical heterogeneity by comparing the results of the xed-effect model meta-analysis and the random-e ffects model meta-analysis, between-study standard deviation (tau2and comparing this with values reported in the study of the dis tribution of between-study heterogeneity ( T urner 2012 calculating the I2statistic (using Stata/SE 14.2 ). If we identify substantial heterogeneity, clinical, methodological, or statistical, we w ill explore and address heterogeneity in a subgroup analysi s (see 'Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity for network me ta-analysis' section). Assessment of transitivity across treatment comparisons We will evaluate the plausibility of transitivity assumpti on (the assumption that the participants included in the differ ent studies with different interventions can be considered to be a part of a multi-arm randomised clinical trial and could potentially have been randomised to any of the treatments) ( Salanti 2012 ). In other words, any participant that meets the inclusion crite ria is, in principle, equally likely to be randomised to any of the above eligible i nterventions. If there is any concern that the clinical safety an d effectiveness are dependent upon the effect modiers, we will continue to do t raditional Cochrane pair-wise comparisons and we will not perf orm a network meta-analysis on all participant subgroups. Assessment of reporting biases For the network meta-analysis, we will judge the reporting bi as by the completeness of the search (i.e. searching various data bases and including conference abstracts), as we do not currently nd any mea ningful order to perform a comparison-adjusted funnel plot as suggested by Chaimani 2012 . However, if we nd any meaningful order, for example, the con trol group used depended upon the year of conduct of the trial, we will use comparison-adjusted funnel p lot as suggested by Chaimani 2012 . Data synthesis Methods for indirect and mixed comparisons We will conduct network meta-analyses to compare multiple inter ventions simultaneously for each of the primary and secondary outcomes. Network meta-analysis combines direct evidence withi n trials and indirect evidence across trials ( Mills 2012 ). We will obtain a network plot to ensure that the trials were connected by treat ments using Stata/SE 14.2 (Chaimani 2013 ). We will exclude any trials that were not connected to the network. We will conduct a Bayesian network meta-analysis using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method in OpenBUGS 3.2.3 as per the guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Decision Support Unit (DSU) documents ( Dias 2014a ). We will model the treatment contrast (i.e. log odds ratio for b inary outcomes, mean difference or standardised mean difference for continuous outcomes, log r ate ratio for count outcomes, and log hazard ratio for time-to-ev ent outcomes) for any two interventions ('functional parameters' ) as a function of comparisons between each individual interven tion and an arbitrarily selected reference group ('basic parameters') (Lu 2006 ) using appropriate likelihood functions and links. We will u se binomial likelihood and logit link for binary outcomes, Pois son likelihood and log link for count outcomes, binomial likel ihood and complementary log-log link for time-to-event outcomes, and norm al likelihood and identity link for continuous outcomes. We wi ll perform a xed-effect model and random-effects model for the net work meta-analysis. We will report both models for comparison with the reference group in a forest plot. For pair-wise comparison, we will report the xed-effect model if the two models report si milar results; otherwise, we will report the more conservative mod el. We will use a hierarchical Bayesian model using three differen t initial values using codes provided by NICE DSU ( Dias 2014a ). We will use a normal distribution with large variance (10,000) for tre atment effect priors (vague or flat priors). For the random-effect s model, we will use a prior distributed uniformly (limits: 0 to 5) for b etween-trial standard deviation but assume similar between -trial standard deviation across treatment comparisons ( Dias 2014a ). We will use a 'burn-in' of 5000 simulations, check for convergen ce visually, and run the models for another 10,000 simulations to obtain effe ct estimates. If we do not obtain convergence, we will increase th e number of simulations for 'burn-in'. If we do not obtain convergence st ill, we will use alternate initial values and priors using me thods suggested byvan Valkenhoef 2012 . We will also estimate the probability that each interventio n ranks at one of the possible positions using the NICE DSU codes ( Dias 2014a ). Assessment of inconsistency We will assess inconsistency (statistical evidence of the violat ion of transitivity assumption) by tting both an inconsiste ncy model and a consistency model. We will use the inconsistency models used in the NICE DSU manual, as we plan to use a common between-study deviation for the comparisons ( Dias 2014b ). In addition, we will use full intera ction model ( Higgins 2012 ) and IF (inconsistency factor) plots ( Chaimani 2013 ) to assess inconsistency. In the presence of inconsistency, we wi ll assess whether the inconsistency is because of clinical or methodological heterogen eity by performing separate analyses for each of the differen t subgroups mentioned in the 'Subgroup analysis and investigation of he terogeneity for network meta-analysis' section below. If there is evidence of inconsistency, we will identify areas in the network where substantial inconsistency might be present in terms of clinical and methodological diversities between trials and, w hen appropriate, limit network meta-analysis to a more compat ible subset of trials. Direct comparison We will perform the direct comparisons using the same codes and t he same technical details. 49 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Sample size calculations T o control for the risk of random errors, we will interpret the information with caution when the accrued sample size in the net work meta-analysis (i.e. across all treatment comparisons) is less t han the required sample size (required information size). For calculation of the required information size, see Appendix 3 . Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity for n etwork meta-analysis We will assess the differences in the effect estimates between the subgroups listed in 'Subgroup analysis' and 'Investiga tion of hetero- geneity' sections using the O penBUGS code ( Dias 2012a ) if we include a sufcient number of trials. We will use the potential modiers as study level covariates f or meta-regression. We will calculate a single common interactio n term (Dias 2012a ). If the 95% credible intervals of the interaction term do not ov erlap zero, we will consider this as evidence of difference in subgroups. Presentation of results We will present the effect estimates with 95% credible interva l for each pair-wise comparisons calculated from the direct compari sons and network meta-analysis. We will also present the cumulativ e probability of the treatment ranks (i.e. the probability th at the treatment is within the top two, the probability that the treatment is w ithin the top three, etc.) in graphs (SUCRA) ( Salanti 2011 ). We will also plot the probability that each treatment is best, second best, third best, etc. for each of the different outcomes (rankograms), which are generally considered more informative ( Salanti 2011 ;Dias 2012b ). We will present the of ndings' tables for mortalit y. In the 'Summary of ndings', we will follow the approach sug gested by Puhan and colleagues ( Puhan 2014 ). First, we will calculate the direct and indirect effect estimate s and 95% credible intervals using the node-splitting approach ( Dias 2010 ), that is calculate the direct estimate for each comparison by inclu ding only trials in which there was direct comparison of treatments and the indirect esti mate for each comparison by excluding the trials in which there wa s direct comparison of treatments. Then we will rate the quality of direct and indirect effect estimates using GRADE which takes i nto account the risk of bias, inconsistency, directness of evidence, i mprecision, and publication bias ( Guyatt 2011 ). Then, we will present the estimates of the network meta-analysis and rate the quali ty of network meta-analysis effect estimates as the best quali ty of evidence between the direct and indirect estimates ( Puhan 2014 ). In addition, in the same table, we will present illustratio ns and information on the number of trials and participants as per the standard 'S ummary of Findings' table. Appendix 2.

Sample size calculation On average, 5% to 7% of people with acute hepatitis B virus infe ction progress to chronic hepatitis B virus infection ( McMahon 2014 ). The required information size based on a control group propor tion of 5%, a relative risk reduction of 20% in the interventio n group, type I error of 5%, and type II error of 20% is 13,492 participan ts. Network analyses are more prone to the risk of random erro rs than direct comparisons ( Del Re 2013 ). Accordingly, a greater sample size is required in indirect comp arisons than direct comparisons (Thorlund 2012 ). The power and precision in indirect comparisons depends upon v arious factors, such as the number of participants included under each comparison and the heterogeneity between t he trials ( Thorlund 2012 ). If there is no heterogeneity across the trials, the sample size in indirect comparisons would be equivalent to the sample size in direct comparisons. The effective indirect sa mple size can be calculated using the number of participants included i n each direct comparison ( Thorlund 2012 ). For example, a sample size of 2500 participants in the direct comparison A versus C (n AC) and a sample size of 7500 participants in the direct comparison B versus C (n BC) results in an effective indirect sample size of 1876 participa nts. However, in the presence of heterogeneity within the comparisons, the sample size required is higher. In the above scenario, for an I2statistic for each of the comparisons A versus C (I AC2) and B versus C (I BC2) of 25%, the effective indirect sample size is 1407 participant s. For an I2statistic for each of the comparisons A 51 Pharmacological interventions for acute hepatitis B infec tion (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.versus C and B versus C of 50%, the effective indirect sample siz e is 938 participants ( Thorlund 2012 ). If there are only three groups and the sample size in the trials is more than the required inf ormation size, we will calculate the effective indirect sample s ize using the following generic formula ( Thorlund 2012 ): ((nAC\u00d7 (1 - I AC2)) \u00d7 (n BCx (1 - I BC2))/((n AC\u00d7 (1 - I AC2)) + (n BC\u00d7 (1 - I BC2)). There is currently no method to calculate the effective indirect s ample size for a network analysis involving more than three i ntervention groups.

Although we followed the planned methodology for ne twork meta-analysis, it was not possible to assess whether the potential effect modiers were similar across different comparisons.

The methodology that we plan to use if we conduct a network meta-analysis in future is available in Appendix 1 . We performed T rial Sequential Analysis in addition to conven tional methods of assessing the risk of random errors using P values.
