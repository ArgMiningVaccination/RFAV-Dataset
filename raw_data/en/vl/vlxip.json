With the weather warming up, it's the perfect time to get out and active! Is that old knee injury preventing you from playing your favorite sport? Or perhaps you are just looking for a workout that is easy on your body? Don't let injury or age slow you down! Check out one of these 5 low-impact outdoor sports that will help you stay in shape and enjoy the weather without causing harm to your joints and muscles: Swimming is a great low impact workout that targets every part of your body. The water creates resistance to tone and build muscle while water buoyancy relieves stress and pressure on your joints. Over all, swimming improves muscle strength and flexibility while also training the body to use oxygen more efficiently. If swimming isn't your cup of tea but you still enjoy the water, try joining a water aerobics class! Whether you are heading out for a serious bike ride, or just around the block a few times, cycling is sure to offer you a great, low-impact workout to get and keep you in shape. Get outdoors and explore your town without the added stress of risking running injuries or overusing muscles. Added bonus: you can get in some great site-seeing along your ride. Rowing is another great workout that targets every part of your body, including your arms, abs, legs, and shoulder muscles. Many gyms offer rowing stations, but if you are looking to get outdoors to enjoy the fresh air as well you can slip a canoe or kayak into any body of water, whether that be the ocean, a lake, or even a stream and enjoy a low impact and scenic workout. Yoga and Pilates are a great low-impact workout that lets you feel the burn without risking serious injury. Though there is a risk of injury if not performed correctly, you can still improve your strength and flexibility without causing too much strain and pressure on your joints. While climbing mount Everest is quite the climb, a smaller more manageable hike can provide a great, intense yet low impact workout. If you are into enjoying nature, grab a pair of supportive sneakers or hiking boots and set out on your adventure! Just be sure to stay properly hydrated if you are spending time in the sun!
