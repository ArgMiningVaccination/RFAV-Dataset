Instead, information about glycan synthesis is encoded in complex reaction networks driven by promiscuous and stochastic enzymes. This complexity and sloppiness drives glycan microheterogeneity (molecule-to-molecule variability) in the final oligomer However, this variability is tightly controlled: a given eukaryotic protein type is typically associated with a narrow, specific glycan oligomer profile driven by sloppy and stochastic enzymes. Here we enumerate the enzymatic causes of oligomer variability, and show how to eliminate each cause. We rigorously demonstrate that cells can specifically synthesize a larger repertoire of glycan oligomers by partitioning promiscuous enzymes across multiple Golgi compartments. This places limits on biomolecular assembly: glycan microheterogeneity becomes unavoidable when the number of compartments is limited, or enzymes are excessively promiscuous. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Archives at the National Centre for Biological Sciences Public Lecture Series https://www.ncbs.res.in/events/apls 40th edition Monthly talks framed around explorations in and around archives. Discussions by artists, archivists, academics, lawyers, teachers, journalists and others. Can a State Love its People? Reflections on governance Harsh Mander Friday, Aug 13 2021. 6:30pm. Register: https://bit.ly/apls-trust Live Stream: https://youtube.com/BLiSCIndia Abstract: One way to think about governance is as a contract between the citizens and the state, one that relies on trust, caring and civility. The talk is a reflection on a simple question: Can a State and its institutions love its people? In Mahatma Gandhi's words, can it wipe every tear from every eye? Today, the calamitous pandemic has often revealed States that abandoned their citizens when they most needed them. As we look forward, on the other side of the pandemic, can we imagine - and build - a just and caring state? The talk would draw from personal experience both within and in resistance to the government, unpacking the idea of fraternity in the constitution, and the journey of seven decades of the Indian republic. Bio: Harsh Mander is a human rights and peace worker, writer, columnist, researcher and teacher. He is known most for his work with survivors of mass violence, hunger, homeless persons and street children. Mr Mander has been in public service in a variety of roles throughout his distinguished career. He worked in the Indian Administrative Service in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh for almost two decades. He is a founding member of the National Campaign for the People's Right to Information. As a Member of the Prime Minister's National Advisory Council from June 2010-12, Mander convened the working groups of various bills, including the Food Security Bill, and co-convened the groups on the Communal and Targeted Violence Bill, Dalits and Minorities, Tribal Rights, among others. He was the Special Commissioner to the Supreme Court of India in the Right to Food case for twelve years from 2005-17. In these 12 years, he investigated for the Supreme Court starvation deaths, and reviewed implementation and directed public policy reform for advancing the right to food and nutrition in several states in India. He is the author of ten books, including Looking Away: Inequality, Prejudice and Indifference in New India (Speaking Tiger, 2015), and, more recently, Partitions of the Heart: Unmaking the Idea of India (Penguin Books India, 2019). He teaches courses on poverty and governance at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, the Open Society Internship for Rights and Governance in the European University; and the India Leaders for Social Sector, among others. And in 2017, Mr Mander established and led the national initiative, Karwan e Mohabbat, or Caravan of Love. The Karwan, a wide-based, collaborative civil society initiative of independent individuals, people's organisations and social movements, is a campaign of continuing journeys of solidarity and conscience to families affected by hate violence across India.

Left-right symmetry is vital for adult mechanical movements and a loss of symmetry is associated with debilitating skeletal disorders such as scoliosis. Symmetry is often assumed to be a default state in somite formation, however, it remains unknown how robust somite shapes and sizes at the same position along the body axis emerge on the left and right sides of the embryo. By imaging left-right somite formation in zebrafish embryos using light-sheet microscopy and by developing automated image analysis tools, we reveal that initial somite anteroposterior lengths and positions are imprecise and consequently many somite pairs form left-right asymmetrically in contrast to the textbook view. Strikingly, these imprecisions are not left unchecked and by performing genetic and biophysical perturbations and by using a mechanical model, we discover a tissue surface tension-based error correction process that adjusts shapes, which ensures precision and symmetry of somites in developing embryos. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| | | |VC Link||Coordinator| The prostate is a walnut-sized organ that sits around the male urethra and contributes secretions important for sperm health. With age, the prostate increases in size and constricts the urethral opening. Prostate hyperplasia affects the vast majority of aging men and is a leading cause of urinary problems. Secretions from the prostate drain into the urethra in a region called the transition zone which is the primary site for hyperplasia. I will describe how single cell RNA-sequencing and histological studies led to the identification of two novel cell types, club and hillock, in the urethra and transition zone of the prostate. Unlike prostate cells, these novel urethral cell types do not depend on male hormones for survival. Men with prostate hyperplasia are treated with drugs to reduce the key male hormone dihydrotestosterone and shrink the prostate. Prostate cells in men treated with hormone reducing drugs undergo an unexpected transition to a club cell-like state. This transition is characterized by a reduction in prostate gland size and morphology as well as an increase in NF-KB signaling. This epithelial plasticity appears to be a survival strategy and a protective mechanism in the face of reduced dihydrotestosterone and increased inflammation. The induction of a urethral cell state as a protective mechanism in the prostate highlights understudied aspects of urethral cells in maintaining homeostasis, immune regulation and anti-microbial activity at the urethral barrier. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Blood cells possess unique capabilities to sense and respond to changes in homeostasis, immune challenges, or nutrient fluctuations. The development and maturation of these blood cells are intriguing as it precedes the development of the other tissues and organs in the animal and continues throughout adult life. Emerging studies across animal systems have shown the intricate role of metabolites and metabolic pathways in shaping the development and functioning of these immune cells. But a thorough understanding of the mechanistic details of metabolic control in blood development and function is still in infancy in the field. This thesis utilizes the Drosophila larval hematopoietic system to investigate the metabolic reliance of blood cells during their development. The metabolic dependencies important for mounting a successful immune response in response to infection and non-immune functions in systemic organismal homeostasis are two areas that the thesis has explored extensively. The first part of the study addressed the metabolic events and developmental programs that control blood progenitor differentiation into a unique cell type called lamellocyte and that drive progenitor innate competency to respond on-demand, such as infection with parasitic wasps. Here, we identified that GABA (-aminobutyric acid) uptake and metabolism within Drosophila blood progenitor cells is crucial to set the levels of a transcription factor sima, which controls cellular immune-competency. The maintenance of immune competency within progenitor cells is important to respond to wasp infection and generate lamellocytes to combat the wasp challenge. The metabolic cue GABA available in the hemolymph is derived from a distant source of neurosecretory cells in the larval brain, and under the control of olfactory stimulation. Moreover, the study also showcased the physiological relevance of this olfaction-immune cross-talk to sense the pathogenic odors from the environment, which lead to priming of the blood progenitor cells with the superior immune response during wasp challenge scenarios. The second part of the thesis investigated the physiological homeostatic functions of a macrophage-like blood cell termed plasmatocytes, in Drosophila. The findings here revealed a novel function of plasmatocytes in controlling the metabolic homeostasis of the animal. Notch pathway emerged as an important regulator within plasmatocytes to facilitate this function of blood cells mediated systemic lipid homeostasis. Active lipid scavenging and lipid metabolism within plasmatocytes possess the potential to moderate the global lipid homeostasis of the larvae. This function of blood cells in controlling metabolic homeostasis is found to be important to control larval physiology and animal growth. Overall, the work undertaken in this thesis uncovers the physiological and functional implications of the internal metabolic homeostasis of blood cells on immunity and organismal metabolic References: 1) Madhwal M, Joshi MK, Ur Rehman PM, Gor K, Shim J, Mukherjee T.

In the last decade, glutamine deamidation has also emerged as an important, irreversible PTM for promoting virulence by antagonising the innate immune signaling pathway. Pathogenic bacteria produce effectors called deamidases which carry out the conversion of a specific glutamine residue in their target protein to a glutamate. Although the cellular phenotypes associated with the activity of several deamidases have been well-characterised, the molecular mechanisms underlying the dysfunction of all known target proteins remain elusive. Several gram-negative pathogenic bacteria have been found to employ glutamine deamidation as a means to shut down the innate immune response through inactivation of the Ubiquitin pathway. Ubiquitination is a PTM which involves the covalent attachment of Ubiquitin (Ub), onto the lysine residue of a substrate protein. Ubiquitination occurs via a three step enzymatic cascade which involves the sequential transfer of Ub by E1, E2 and E3 enzymes onto a substrate lysine. Ub can be attached to the substrate either as a single unit or as poly-Ub chains synthesized by attachment of successive Ub molecules either on the same or different lysine. The unique chain topologies presented by ubiquitinated substrates mediate differential interactions in cellular processes such as protein degradation, endocytosis, DNA repair and immune response. In the context of innate immunity, K48/K63-linked chains are involved in activation of the NF-kB inflammatory response to an invading pathogen. My thesis aims to understand the mechanisms by which three proteins involved in the ubiquitin pathway, namely, (i) UBC13, (ii) NEDD8 and (iii) Ubiquitin, are inactivated by glutamine deamidation. Extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to uncover the underlying mechanisms. In addition to using conventional MD simulations (cMD) on the sub-microsecond timescale, enhanced sampling approaches such umbrella sampling (US) and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) were also used to quantify the effect of deamidation on the stability of protein-protein complexes. In all three target proteins studied, deamidation triggers the formation of intramolecular salt-bridges involving arginine residues in proximity to the glutamate residue formed upon deamidation. The formation of intramolecular salt-bridges was found to hinder non-covalent association between the deamidated proteins and their interaction partners which lead to loss of cellular function. In addition to the formation of intramolecular salt-bridges, mechanisms such as electrostatic repulsion and non-native intermolecular salt-bridges may also contribute towards inactivation of deamidase targets. In several instances, the mechanisms underlying the inactivation of deamidated proteins proposed by MD simulations were supported by NMR Das.
