If your business or facility is in Toronto you may have to submit a ChemTRAC report to Toronto Public Health each year to comply with the [Environmental Disclosure and Reporting Bylaw](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/municode/1184_423.pdf). The amounts of chemicals your facility releases, manufactures, processes or otherwise uses may change from year to year. Therefore, some years you may not meet the reporting thresholds, which means you would not have to report for those years. It is important to check every year if you need to report or not. Review [ChemTRAC's Guide to Reporting](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/9745-TPH-ChemTRAC-guide-to-reporting.pdf) for more information. *Note: some businesses/facilities are exempt from the bylaw, listed below. If you own or operate more than one business/facility in Toronto, you must review each and report them separately as required. Exempt businesses and facilities are described by their [North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes](https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&TVD=118464) and include: The chemicals listed in the bylaw come from many different sources, and certain sources are exempt from reporting. This means chemicals from these sources are not included in calculations: |Exempt chemical source||Example| |An article (an item that already contained a toxic chemical before it entered your facility and that doesn't release any of the chemical when it is used or processed)||A tool or part of a machine| |A structural component of a facility||A wall or floor| |A product used for routine cleaning, facility and grounds upkeep||Washroom sanitizer| |The personal items of the people in |Vehicle emissions||Dump truck dust||From the movement of vehicles| |Emissions from space heaters or hot water heaters that are not part of the process equipment||Emissions from a furnace to heat a building or water boiler for hot water used in washrooms. Note: only exempt if not used in the manufacturing process| |Materials used for the purpose of maintaining motor vehicles operated by the facility| The bylaw requires you to report every year for both use and release amounts of all chemicals that meet or exceed the reporting threshold. The amounts or types of chemicals your facility uses or releases may change from year to year. Because of this, you should review your reporting requirements each year to determine whether or not you need to report. If your facility is not exempt from the bylaw, you need to: We have many tools, tips and guides to help you prepare for reporting.

The City may request this information for bylaw enforcement purposes. Tracking and reporting to ChemTRAC helps businesses and facilities identify the major sources of chemicals in their facility. This information can be used to develop plans to reduce the use and release of chemicals. This is also an opportunity for businesses to share the pollution prevention efforts they are making and to explain how their business works through the voluntary Environmental Statement in the [ChemTRAC Disclosure Report](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/health-programs-advice/chemtrac/chemtrac-disclosure/). Going green improves Toronto's environment and people's health but it also can make good business sense.
