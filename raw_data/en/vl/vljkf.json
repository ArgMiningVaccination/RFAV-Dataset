For more information regarding immunization, visit the links and resources provided. Immunization Highlights Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to protect children and adults against many common infectious diseases. Many people that delayed vaccination during the pandemic are still behind schedule on routine vaccines. August marks the annual observance of National Immunization Awareness Month (NIAM) and is the perfect time to remind Georgians of all ages to protect their health by catching up on all recommended vaccinations. Vaccines are available for these preventable diseases: | | Diptheria | | Pneumococcal | | Hepatitis A | | Poliomyelitis (Polio) | | Hepatitis B | | Rabies | | Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) | | Rotavirus | | Human Papillomavirus (HPV) | | Rubella | | Influenza (Seasonal Flu) | | Shingles (Herpes Zoster) | | Measles | | Tetanus | | Meningococcal | | Typhoid Fever | | Mumps | | Varicella | | Pertussis (Whooping Cough) | | COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Below are resources that may help answer questions of all age groups to encourage staying current on vaccines.

Vaccine-preventable disease levels are at or near record lows. Even though most infants and toddlers have received all recommended vaccines by age 2, many under-immunized children remain, leaving the potential for outbreaks of disease. Many adolescents and adults are under-immunized as well, missing opportunities to protect themselves against diseases such as Hepatitis B, influenza, and pneumococcal disease.
