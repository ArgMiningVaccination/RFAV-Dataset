How Can I Clean My Aura? When you clean or cleanse your aura, you get rid of low vibes or negative energies which affect your heart, mind, and body. We've already talked about [how to remove negative energy from your home](https://consciousitems.com/blogs/home/how-to-remove-negative-energy-from-your-home). Right now we're not going to focus on all the ways you can experience negative energy. For the purpose of this post, we'll just deal with how you can overcome those low vibes and negative energies. An aura cleansing or a spiritual cleansing will repel negativity and invite the highest possible vibes into your soul. A high vibe aura is a sign of progress with your spirituality, but also of overall health. One fuels the other as you make progress along your life journey. Negativity includes low vibes generated from within yourself and those coming from outside sources as well. The spiritual cleansing methods we'll talk about work well for both types of low vibes. How Do You Cleanse Your Heart, Mind, And Body? Keep in mind that the best spiritual cleansing solution for one person doesn't have to be the best solution for another. We're all different, so different aura cleansing solutions might appeal more to each of us. The best approach is to try them all and see what works best for you. The spiritual cleansing solutions we'll talk about can help you reconnect with the energy of the Universe and of Mother Gaia. That's going to help you clear out any negative vibes affecting you. Using these spiritual cleansing solutions can help you detoxify your mind and body and restore your happiness and wellbeing. In order to clean your aura, you can connect with the elements. That leads to a thorough aura cleansing, especially when done regularly. You can also use a few healthy spiritual practices as an effective spiritual cleansing process. These practices cultivate positive energy and optimize your energetic field the more you repeat them. Don't feel like you have to stick to just one solution! In fact, we recommend you use as many spiritual cleansing methods as you feel called to. There's never such a thing as over-cleansing your environment and entire body. 1. Connect with nature Begin your spiritual cleansing by taking long walks in nature, preferably barefoot if you can. The best way to connect with the healing and cleansing energy of Mother Gaia is through being outside. Walking barefoot is going to make the contact even more direct, but it's not mandatory. It can be a walk in the fields, in verdant woods, or on the sandy shores of your favorite beach. When you're connecting with Mother Gaia, it's not necessarily about the details of your environment. It's about mindfully reaching out to the nurturing and abundant energy of the Earth. That's going to initiate or amplify a natural and gentle aura cleansing. Connecting with nature through taking a walk is the simplest and most direct way to clean your aura. You'll feel the generous and nourishing energy of Gaia wash over you. It will replenish your heart and bring balance to your thoughts. Emotional wounds will heal faster. The unpleasant low vibes you've been dealing with will become a thing of the past with the help of this spiritual cleansing solution. 2. Use crystals for cleansing Using crystals for cleansing is one of the most effective methods for spiritual cleansing so you overcome negativity. With the help of these crystals, you can do some powerful aura cleansing. You'll release negative emotions and set yourself free from energetic burdens. Set an intention for your crystals to help you clean your aura. You'll soon feel like a weight is being lifted from your shoulders. That's the sign you're doing some heavy aura cleaning. Some of the most powerful crystal cleansing options are: - [Selenite](https://consciousitems.com/collections/selenite): cleanses your aura and your environment - [Clear Quartz](https://consciousitems.com/collections/clear-quartz): amplifies positive energy and high vibes - Black [Obsidian](https://consciousitems.com/collections/obsidian): protects you from negative vibes - Black [Tourmaline](https://consciousitems.com/collections/tourmaline): gets rid of bad energy and low vibes There are many powerful crystals that are great for spiritual cleansing. We've just mentioned a few, but you can check out the [healing and cleansing](https://consciousitems.com/collections/healing-and-cleansing) section for more suggestions. Choose the aura cleansing stone that your intuition guides you towards. 3. Use herbs and essential oils Plants Dried plants have been used for spiritual protection and spiritual cleansing ever since ancient times. You can use them for burning too, but we'll cover that part later on. Simply keeping these plants in your home is going to cleanse your environment, your own energy, and purify your aura. You can hang them by the entry points of your home, doors, windows, and close to any vents. That way, they'll filter through any energy present or entering your home. You'll feel more at ease and protected with the help of these powerful allies. Some of the herb options you can use for spiritual cleansing are: - Sage - Palo Santo - Sandalwood - Frankincense resin - Mugwort - Juniper - Rosemary - Cedar - Lavender Oils There are other natural ways to cleanse, such as using an [essential oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil). You can use essential oil to anoint the entry points of your home to make sure that negative energy can't get in. Then use aromatherapy to cleanse your home of any lingering negative energies - including your own. A few powerful essential oil options you can use for spiritual cleansing are: - Lavender - Cedarwood - Peppermint - Lemon/Orange - Tea Tree - Palo Santo - Bergamot - Sage - Eucalyptus - Ylang Ylang - Chamomile You can also try the [Crystal Energies - Essential Oil Roller Bottle Set](https://consciousitems.com/products/crystal-energies), which combines the power of crystal and essential oil to bring you the best of both worlds. You never know what the future holds. But when using your favorite herb and essential oil to keep your aura clean, you make sure you're prepared for whatever might be coming your way. 4. Take a spiritual bath What is a spiritual bath? Such a bath refers to a ritual that focuses on cleansing the energies of the body and stimulating the senses. Spiritual soaking baths You can soak in hot water and spend time in that peaceful and quiet place. This bath will give you a feeling of great relaxation. Allow for 20-60 minutes of uninterrupted soaking, if you can. These baths for aura cleansing usually involve not just soaking into the water, but also adding some things into it. Salt is one of the main ingredients of spiritual baths. You can use [Epsom salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsomite), Himalayan salt, or even your regular table salt when you're in a pinch. Add it to the water and set the intention for it to cleanse your entire energetic body. If you feel comfortable with adding a drop of essential oil into your bathtub, that also works great. But don't add more than a drop. It's not about the quantity but the energetic quality of the oil, after all. Any of the essential oils for spiritual cleansing we already talked about will be great for your bath. Spiritual showers Even a simple shower can act as a spirit-cleaning bath, as long as you set the intention for it. Maybe you don't have a bathtub or can't spare the time to do a proper soak. It's effective to use your daily shower as a soul-cleansing practice, too. Focus on the cleansing feeling of the water sliding over your body. Imagine all of the negative energy and stress that is present within you running down your body and into that drain, along with the shower water. 5. Use smudging or burning a cleansing herb Smudging is the process of burning some dried cleansing herb. The resulting smoke has powerful energetic properties of cleaning your spirit. One of the most commonly used herbs is Sage, White Sage more often than not. But Sage is not your only option for spiritual cleansing. As long as the herbs have been dried properly, any of the ones we mentioned above work fine for smudging. You can also use incense or specially-made cones and sticks. Be mindful that in order to have a proper effect, the incense needs to be made of that actual herb and not just have its scent. While very pleasant, of course, the scent alone doesn't present the spiritual cleansing powers of the actual herbs being burned. How do you smudge? The process of smudging is fairly straightforward. You get a fire-resistant surface to place the burning dried herbs on, like a ceramic plate, a large seashell, or something similar. The [Keep Calm & Stay Home: Ultimate Quarantine Set](https://consciousitems.com/products/quarantine-set) offers the perfect combination of elements for smudging. You can also use some bird feathers or green leaves or flowers to waft the smoke into particular directions. If you don't have any on hand, you can simply use the palm of your hand to waft smoke in the direction of the object or area you're smudging. The smoke needs to touch an area in order for the cleanse to happen. You're ready to get started with your spiritual cleansing. Light the fire on your dried herbs and gently blow it out. What you want is not an open flame, but the smoke resulting from a slow burn. As you waft the smoke around, you keep that slow burn going. Make sure you have all of your doors, windows, and other entry points closed before you start the process. The point is to have a clear environment that is your own. You walk with your smoke-wafting herbs around that space, making sure to get the smoke close to all doors, windows, and entry points. You can repeat a chant or say prayers as you walk around. It will amplify the cleansing power of the process. Once you've covered the entire space and yourself, the cleansing is complete. You can allow the fire to die out or stub it out. Now you need to open up every door, window, and entry point you can. You'll see the plumes of smoke waft out of your space. With them, out go any remnants of negative energies and low vibes. Is smudging effective for beginners? You don't have to be an expert in spirituality for the process to work. Just get going and repeat it on a regular basis. Like keeping crystals and herbs in your home, the mere presence of the smoke is going to work even if it's the very first time you're trying it out. But if you're more experienced and develop a process for it, it can work even better. You should smudge yourself and your environment regularly. Always see it through to put out the fire, not leaving dried herbs to burn without you being present! 6. Meditation and/or prayer Regular practice of meditation or prayer is going to help cleanse your aura. Whether you believe in God and pray or in the Universe and meditate, or do a mixture of both, there's no wrong way to connect with the spiritual world and your higher power. Either way, you'll fill your spirit with light and achieve inner peace. If you have trouble with meditating but you'd like to try, you can use something like the [Buddhist Meditation Set](https://consciousitems.com/products/meditation-set) to get you started. It invites mindfulness and clears your mind so you can enter a state of meditation. 7. Embrace the light Light has been revered as sacred ever since ancient cultures. Whether it's sunlight, moonlight, or even artificial light, it has spiritual cleansing power. Natural light Go out in direct sunlight at noon or under direct moonlight during a Full Moon. Focus on the light and imagine it embracing your spirit. Candle light has the same cleansing effect. You can light a candle and envision the light of the flame enveloping your entire being, cleansing your soul. As with burning sage, if you're using candles don't let them burn unsupervised. The more you visualize the light enveloping you, the more it will grow into a regular cleansing practice. You'll slowly get to the stage where you imagine every beam is going to be yet another way to cleanse your energy and clean your aura. It can become a form of meditation. Artificial light You can also use spirituality lamps such as crystal lamps. They're very powerful because they combine the power of crystals with the power of light to bring you the best of each world. Salt lamps are also a great option. Whether it's an artificial light lamp like the [Rose Salt Night Light](https://consciousitems.com/products/salt-light) or a Himalayan salt candle holder, it's still going to have great spiritual cleansing power. 8. Healthy and mindful living A good way to maintain your spirit clean is to practice a healthy and mindful lifestyle. Use the spiritual cleansing methods we already discussed regularly. But you can also minimize how much negative energy enters your life by following a few simple rules. Healthy nutrition What you consume has an energetic signature. The closer that energy is to a natural state, the higher the vibes it brings into your body. Overly processed food is of a lower vibe than natural organic food. The same goes for beverages. Maybe going full organic isn't a feasible option for you. But at least do your best to include as many high vibe nutrients in your diet as you can. It's one of the most powerful and durable ways to cleanse your aura. Practice self-love Treat yourself with love and kindness, always. The love you give yourself is the love you're able to give others, after all. Imagine you're sharing with the world the emotions you direct towards yourself. Treat yourself as the precious, unique, brilliant gem you are in the eyes of your higher power. Take it this way: if you're not treating yourself with love, it's a sign of disrespecting the work of your higher power. By practicing self-love you'll reduce the impact and presence of negative energies. That will lighten the energetic load on your aura. If you're having trouble channeling the vibe of self-love, try the [Self-Care Lamp](https://consciousitems.com/products/care-lamp). It will introduce the high vibes of self-care into your life. Low tech days Take time off from all the techy stuff whenever you can. Spend it connecting with your loved ones or soul tribe face to face. That way, you'll minimize electromagnetic fields affecting your vibe. Exclude toxicity and negativity Cut out of your life toxic substances, feelings, and people. Free yourself of anger, fear, and other low vibe feelings to lead a more abundant and satisfying life. The less toxic energy and negativity you allow into your energy field, the less of it you have to get cleansed. It's Spring Cleaning Season For Your Aura!
