Avoid too much of a good thing If you're already eating a balanced diet of vegetables, fruits, grains, lean proteins and healthy fats, you shouldn't need pricey supplements. While supplements are necessary for some, they're not for everyone.

One mistake is consuming too much of one vitamin or taking unnecessary supplements. Your body gets rid of excess vitamins and minerals, leading to money wasted on unneeded nutrients. Also, taking too much of one vitamin or mineral may deplete another. Zinc and copper are prime examples.
