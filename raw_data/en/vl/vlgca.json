Improve navigation of the health care system for cancer patients through patient navigation services. a. Continue to offer the cancer patient navigator program to SMH cancer patients. Ongoing SMH Clinical Case Manager, Oncology Administration Cancer Access to Care Patient Navigation Care Management The Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute includes the Breast Health Center and the Neuro -Oncology Center, with designated licensed clinical social workers (LCSWs), nurse patient navi gators, genetic counselors and dieticians who support and guide cancer patients and their families from the time of diagnosis through the course of treatment. In FY 2019, the LCSWs provided free psychological counseling and support as well as referrals to community organizations for more than 3,000 patients and family members. Nurse navigators provided ongoing guidance for patients and families impacted by all cancer diagnoses through myriad supportive services, including referrals to numerous community age ncies , explanation of procedures and test results , assistance with financial resources and more. Sharp's 2019 CHNA process included a facilitated discussion with Sharp Cancer Patient Navigators. In this discussion - and through other tools discussed below - financial distress was identified as a critical need to address for cancer patients and their families. Includes concerns in both inpatient and outpatient settings. As such, there is work in progress to bring Sharp teams together for syst emwide strategies and resource utilization to address patient financial needs. This includes exploration of software (Vivor) and financial navigation resource implementation. To better assist the community, the Cancer Centers of Sharp, which includes SCVM C, SGH and SMH , share direct links to community resources and agencies by service needed as well as information on ACP on sharp.com. Patient record is easy to access and also downloadable for documenting mediations, allergies, screenings and treatments. Th e Cancer Centers of Sharp also include a new online assessment on sharp.com for individuals to assess if at risk and qualify for a lung screening.

Ongoing (evaluated annually) Vice President Oncology Service Line SMH Cancer Patient Navigator Coordinator Oncology Social Workers Sharp Nurses Cancer Fear Care Management Logistical support services SDOH (especially financial) Beginning in June 2019, an electronic distress screening (available in both English and Spanish), using a validated tool distributed by the Cancer Support Community, was implemented. The tool provides easier methods for completion, timely results sharing, report tabulation and chronologic comp arison of results for each patient for monitoring. Algorithms were established for each question to identify information resources for concern and staff member provided support if desired. Goals for 2019 and the future include e xpand ed use of the tool to increase the number of patients screene d at least one time, as well as the number of patients screened more than one time, especially at times of care transitions. Financial concerns were a key source of distress for cancer patients identified in 2019 an d thus comparisons of financial distress data across multiple years are underway. More recently, housing and transportation services have become a chief patient concern amidst the COVID -19 pandemic. To compare financial distress data form Distress Screenin g Reports in FY 2019 to FY 2020 and/or FY 2021. Distress Screening Background : Distress Screening to assess psychological, social, spiritual and practical issues contributing to cancer patient distress has been conducted at SGH over the past several years .

Ongoing Vice President Oncology Service Line Cancer Fear Care Management Logistical Support Services SDOH (especially financial) In April 2019, the Cancer Centers of Sharp implemented a revised PowerForm for better capture and reporting on logistical support services needed and referrals provided. Cancer Patient Navigator PowerForm Background : Cancer patient navigators across Sharp collaborated to define, develop and propose a new Cerner Oncology Navigator PowerForm. The PowerForm was designed to standardize the cancer patient navigator's documentation, increase efficiency in patient care coordination, and improve overall patient care. By utilizing the PowerForm, n avigators can document their assessment of patient needs and barriers to care , in addition to how they addressed patient unmet needs with appropriate internal and external support services and referrals. The need of f inancial assistance was selected as the Integrated Network Cancer Program annual goal, and now n avigators document interventions specifically for financial barrier s. The data from the documentation will be analyzed to optimize Sharp cancer care continuum.

Increase coverage for patients seen in the Emergency Department (ED) by providing assistance to secure health coverage for all individuals entitled to the benefit; also provide payment options for individuals that chose not to secure coverage or are not currently eligible for health benefits. Secure benefit concurrent with stay when Med i-Cal Presumptive Eligibility rules apply. a. Continue to provide services to help every unfunded patient received in the ED find coverage options. Ongoing (evaluated annually) Supervisor, Patient Assistance Navigators Access to Care Education In 2014, Sh arp hospitals implemented an on -site process for real -time Medi -Cal eligibility determinations (Presumptive Eligibility), making Sharp the first hospital system in SDC to provide this s ervice. In FY 2020 YTD, Sharp secured this benefit for more than 1,000 unfunded patients in the ED. Continued unknowns in understanding the efficacy of efforts include: the increase in the patient out of pocket responsibility resulting from health plan coverage purchased off the exchange; and the transition of qualified unfunded patients directly to Medi -Cal. Sharp has initiated a process of trending straight self -pay collections separate from balance after insurance collections in an effort to closely monitor these two distinct populations. The PointCare program continues to collect metrics on a number of individuals served and cost savings. From October 2015 to September 2019, Sharp helped 71,454 self-pay patients through PointCare, while maintaining each patient's dignity throughout the process. Backgr ound : PointCare is a quick, web -based screening, enrollment and reporting technology designed by a team of health coverage experts to provide community members with health coverage and financial assistance options. At Sharp, patients use PointCare's simple online questionnaire to generate personalized coverage options that are filed in their account for future reference and accessibility.
