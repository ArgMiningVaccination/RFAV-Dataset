COVID has already taken millions of lives worldwide and there is a need to review the existing medical intervention. When there is an outbreak of a disease, our body's defense mechanism works as a shield to prevent the body from invading pathogens. This ability of humans has evolved over a long period. Though the COVID-19 pandemic is threatening the world, even in the absence of any targeted medicine or vaccine, 433 million people recovered, which speaks volumes about the immune system's capability to counter hitherto unknown invaders. The proposed plasma therapy is also dependent on the antibodies produced by the immune system of a recovered patient. Vaccines created against SARS-CoV2 also trigger the natural immune system to make the necessary antibodies before the active virus attacks. Thus, all available and future roads point towards the capability of our immune system only. The COVID waves made scientists and researchers understand that not every person exposed to the SARS CoV-2 virus gets infected, and not all COVID-positive patients develop respiratory issues[1]. The conventional medicinal system has also contributed in a great way to curb the situation. However, an accepted and recommended approach to complementary therapies as a holistic tool has not found its way. Antibiotics target pathogens mostly with no consideration of repercussions on host cells [2]. In this paper, we have tried to address the current situation and the role of yoga, meditation, and breathing techniques to help face the crisis and prepare our immune system for possible further outbreaks. We also look at diet and other factors that impair our immunity and make us more vulnerable to virus attacks. 2020 Editor's Note: As an acute condition quickly associated with multiple chronic susceptibilities, COVID-19 has rekindled interest in, and controversy about, the potential role of the host in disease processes. While hundreds of millions of research dollars have been funneled into drug and vaccine solutions that target the external agent, integrative practitioners tuned to enhancing immunity faced a familiar mostly unfunded task. First, go to school on the virus. Then draw from the global array of natural therapies and practices with host-enhancing or anti-viral capabilities to suggest integrative treatment strategies. The near null-set of conventional treatment options propels this investigation. In this paper, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of California-San Diego, Chopra Library for Integrative Studies, and Harvard University share one such exploration. Their conclusion, that \"certain meditation, yoga asana (postures), and pranayama (... The Ochsner journal 2014 Mind-body therapies (MBTs) are used throughout the world in treatment, disease prevention, and health promotion. However, the mechanisms by which MBTs exert their positive effects are not well understood. Investigations into MBTs using functional genomics have revolutionized the understanding of MBT mechanisms and their effects on human physiology. We searched the literature for the effects of MBTs on functional genomics determinants using MEDLINE, supplemented by a manual search of additional journals and a reference list review. We reviewed 15 trials that measured global or targeted transcriptomic, epigenomic, or proteomic changes in peripheral blood. Sample sizes ranged from small pilot studies (n=2) to large trials (n=500). While the reliability of individual genes from trial to trial was often inconsistent, genes related to inflammatory response, particularly those involved in the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) pathway, were consistently downregulated across most studies. In ge... Annals of Neurosciences https://www.ijhsr.org/IJHSR_Vol.11_Issue.2_Feb2021/IJHSR-Abstract.019.html Corona virus disease (Covid 19) is newly discovered viral infectious disease; which has spread all over the world. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 th January 2020. This study is a literature review; searches were carried out to find out the role of yoga; on immunomodulation related to the prevention and cure in Covid 19, by using popular search engines, including Google and Google Scholar within the period of 04 months. The results were interpreted as percentages of collected total articles. Seventy articles were reviewed and 100 % of the articles showed (directly or indirectly) yoga has immunomodulatory role. Thirty nine articles (56%) were proved that yoga is beneficial in reducing sign and symptoms of Covid 19. The present study found that yoga has immunomodulatory role and yoga therapy can be applied for the prevention and cure of Covid 19 (\"Novel Corona Virus\").Yoga, meditation & other yogic practices enhance the overall immunity, specially Jala Nethi and Pranayama are very important yoga therapies for the prevention and cure of Covid 19. Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice 2014 International Journal of Yoga 2021 Conflicts and humanitarian crises lead to serious mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, stress, and cognitive decline. Exposure to these circumstances in early life can lead to the development of disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), for which no treatments are available. In this review, various research papers have been compiled to develop an understanding about mental health of population affected due to wars and conflicts and how stress and depression can accelerate the development of dementia and AD. Due to failure of drugs in the treatment of dementia and AD, yoga and mindfulness-based approach has been proposed for future investigations. Although studies have shown that yoga and mindfulness can be helpful in the management of stress, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder in the war-afflicted areas, limited mechanistic studies in yoga and mindfulness remain the chief cause precluding its clini... Effects of Stress on Human Health [Working Title] 2019 Journal of Evidence-Based Integrative Medicine During recent decades, stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, chronic tension headache, and migraine have established their stronghold in the lives of a vast number of people worldwide. In order to address this global phenomenon, intensive studies have been carried out leading to the advancement of drugs like anti-depressants, anxiolytics, and analgesics which although help in combating the symptoms of such disorders but also create long-term side effects. Thus, as an alternative to such clinical practices, various complementary therapies such as yoga and meditation have been proved to be effective in alleviating the causes and symptoms of different neuropsychiatric disorders. The role of altered brain waves in this context has been recognized and needs to be pursued at the highest level. Thus, the current study provides a review focused on describing the effects of yoga and meditation on anxiety and depression as well as exploring brain waves as a to...
