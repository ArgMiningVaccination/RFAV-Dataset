Causes - Reduced Blood Flow: Usually due to reduced blood flow to the brain for a short time. - Standing Too Long: Causes pooling of blood in the legs when stationary. - Standing Up Suddenly: Causes a sudden drop in blood pressure. - Dehydration: Potentially from losing fluids and/or not drinking enough fluid. - Low Oxygen: With increased activity, like running, lower than normal oxygen levels are not able to meet the body's needs for a short time. - Too Much Sun or Hot Tub Use: Increased sweating causes fluid loss. - Fasting: Skipping a meal causes low blood sugar. - Motion Sickness: Main symptoms include dizziness and nausea. - Viral Syndrome: Patients with viral illnesses like a cold or flu often experience dizziness. This is never the only symptom. - Vertigo: In addition to dizziness, an enhanced feeling that the room is spinning or the inability to walk. Seek immediate medical attention. A balance disorder is a complex condition that causes unsteadiness and dizziness, and sensations of spinning, moving or floating. Part of the inner ear known as the labyrinth interacts with other body systems, including those of the eyes, bones and joints, to maintain balance. Normal balance requires the work of three sensory systems: the visual; the vestibular, which is located in the inner ear; and the somatosensory, which involves the muscular and skeletal systems. These systems, as well as the brain and nervous systems, can be the source of balance problems. When these systems do not function properly, vertigo, spinning, disorientation, trouble focusing the eyes, and poor balance may result. Symptoms of Balance Disorders Symptoms of balance disorders may come and go, or be constant. They may cause anxiety or panic when they occur, and may include: - Dizziness - Vertigo - Lightheadedness - Motion sickness - Blurry vision - Disorientation - Nausea Vomiting, diarrhea, and increased heart rate or blood pressure may also accompany these symptoms. Causes of Balance Disorders The symptoms of many balance disorders start suddenly, with no obvious cause. However, a balance disorder is often the result of another underlying medical condition. These medical conditions usually affect the visual, vestibular or general sensory systems, or the brain. Balance disorders may also be caused by: - Certain medications - Ear infections - Head injury - Aging - Blood-circulation disorders affecting the inner ear or brain Low blood pressure can sometimes cause dizziness when an individual stands up too quickly. Diagnosis of Balance Disorders Because dizziness and vertigo are symptoms of many conditions, it can be hard to pinpoint the exact cause of balance disorders. Depending on a patient's symptoms, a series of audiologic, vestibular and movement tests may be performed in order to reach a diagnosis. Types of Balance Disorders Identifying the underlying cause and the type of balance disorder are both important for successful treatment. Balance disorders are commonly characterized by their symptoms or causes. There are several types of common balance disorders. Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo Also known as BPPV, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a condition that causes feelings of vertigo after specific position changes of the head. BPPV may be caused by an infection or inflammation of the ear that causes the calcium particles to shift, resulting in balance problems and vertigo. Patients who suffer from BPPV may have brief periods of vertigo that come and go. Labyrinthitis Labyrinthitis results in dizziness and a loss of balance. It is usually caused by an infection or inflammation of the inner ear that is the result of an upper-respiratory infection. Labyrinthitis is frequently a result of chronic, untreated middle-ear infections. Symptoms of labyrinthitis usually subside when the infection clears up. Meniere's Disease Meniere's disease symptoms, which are caused by an imbalance of fluid in the inner ear, include vertigo, hearing loss and ringing in the ears. Symptoms of Meniere's disease may vary in both frequency and intensity. Some patients experience many symptoms within a short period of time, followed by months or years without them. Vestibular Neuronitis Also known as vestibular neuritis, vestibular neuronitis is the swelling of the vestibular nerve, which is responsible for sending balance signals from the inner ear to the brain. This condition usually causes vertigo. Vestibular neuronitis often follows a cold or other viral infection, although by the time symptoms arise, the viral infection is usually long gone. Perilymph Fistula Perilymph fistula is the leakage, caused by a physical injury or exertion, of inner-ear fluid. The symptoms of perilymph fistula may include dizziness, vertigo, nausea and vomiting. Some patients experience ringing or fullness in the ears, and many notice hearing loss. Symptoms may get worse when there is a change in altitude or air pressure. Treatment for Balance Disorders Treatment for a balance disorder depends on its cause, and treating the cause often eliminates the balance problem. The following treatments may also help to relieve symptoms: - Balance-training exercises - Lifestyle changes, such as limiting alcohol and caffeine - Antibiotics for ear infections - Anti-vertigo and anti-nausea medications "}
