According to CMS, a QCDR is a CMS -approved entity that collects medical and/or clinica l data for the purpose of patient and disease tracking to foster improvement in the quality of care provided to patients. The AAAAI QCDR offers a comprehensive range of capabilities to aid providers in their quality improvement and CMS reporting. In addition to data gathering and CMS submission, the QCDR also serves as an improvement tool offering performance tracking, peer benchmarking, improvement opportunity analysis, and case -level analytics. The QCDR is powered by the ArborMetrix platfo rm, a CMS - approved vendor for quality reporting used by thousands of providers via the multiple QCDR its supports. Requirements As finalized in the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) and its new approach to payment called the Quality Payment Program rewarding providers under two paths: Advanced Alternative Payment Models (Advanced APMs) and the Merit -based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) for eligible clinicians or groups under the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS), successful reporting through a QCDR in 20 20 for the purposes of avoiding the 202 2 negative payment adjustm ent of 9% requires the following: Report on up to six (6) measures Of these measures, include at least one (1 ) outcomes measure Report for the full calendar year Since 2016, CMS allow s both individual clinicians and group practices participating in the GPRO to report quality measures via a QCDR . And as of 2018, a new participation option was added, Virtual Groups reporting. Please refer to https://qpp.cms.gov/about/resource -library for full details on the MIPS and APM categories criteria. Measures A qualified clinical data registry (QCDRs) differ s from a qualified registry in reporting requirements and is the only MIPS reporting method that hosts non-MIPS measures approved by CMS for the purposes of MIPS reporting . Non -MIPS measures are measures that are not contained in the MIPS measures set released by CMS for the applicable reporting period . These can be \" homegrown \" measures developed by entities such as the Joint Task Force on Quality and Performance Measurement (a joint task force of the AAAAI and the American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology) or MIPS measures that have substantive differences in the manne r reported by the QCDR. For instance, MIPS measure #398: Optimal Asthma Control is used in the AAAAI QCDR without the upper age limit of 50 with the permission of the measure steward, Minnesota Com munity Measurement, and is therefore considered a non -MIPS measure. Other non-MIPS measures in the AAAAI QCDR include measures from the Bridges to Excellence\u00ae Asthma Care Recognition Program, owned and developed by Health Care Incentives Improvement Institute, Inc. Additionally, the AAAAI QCDR hosts 1 7 MIPS measures.

Asthma is a chronic disease associated with familial, infectious, allergenic, socioeconomic, psychosocial and environmental factors. It is not curable but is treatable. Despite improvements in diagnosis and management, and an increased understanding of the epidemiology, immunology, and biology of the disease, asthma prevalence has p rogressively increased over the past 15 years. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: From the National Quality Forum's 2013 report, Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) in Performance Measurement: Patient and family engagement is increasingly acknowledged as a key component of a comprehensive strategy, (along with performance improvement and accountability), to achieve a high quality, affordable health system. Emerging evidence affirms that patients who are engaged in their care tend to experience better outc omes and choose less costly but effective interventions. Historically, with the exception of collecting feedback on satisfaction or experience with care, patients remain an untapped resource in assessing the quality of healthcare and of long -term support services. Patients are a valuable and, arguably, the authoritative source of information on outcomes beyond experience with care. These include health -related quality of life, functional status, symptom and symptom burden, and health behaviors. Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) are standardized instruments that capture patients' self -assessment of their health and can provide timely information on patient health status, function and symptoms over time that can be used to impro ve patient -centered care and inform clinical decision -making. The Asthma Control TestTM (ACT) is a validated self -administered survey utilizing 5 questions to assess asthma control on a scale from 0 (poor control) to 5 (total control) in individuals 12 years and older. \u00a9 20 02 by QualityMetric Incorporated.

The Childhood Asthma Control Test (C -ACT) is a caregiver -assisted, child -completed tool that can be used with or without lung function assessment to asses s pediatric asthma control at home or in clinical practice for children ages 4 -11 years. It consists of 7 questions of which 4 are child -reported and 3 are caregiver -reported questions. \u00a92011 The GlaxoSmithKline Group of Companies.

This measure may be reported by clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the services provided and the measure -specific denomina tor coding. Data Source: Measure Reporting via Registry: ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, CPT codes, and patient demographics are used to identify patients who are included in the measure's denominator. The listed numerator options are used to report the num erator of the measure The quality -data codes listed do not need to be submitted for registry -based submissions; however, these codes may be submitted for those registries that utilize claims data. There are no allowable performance exclusions for this measure. DENOMINATOR: All patients aged 5 years and older with a diagnosis of asthma Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): Patients aged 5 years on date of encounter AND Diagnosis for were evaluated at least once during the measurement period for asthma control; of those patients whose asthma is poorly controlled, a care plan is updat ed. Numerator Instructions: Completion of a validated questionnaire will also meet the numerator requirement for this component of the measure. Validated questionnaires for asthma assessment include, but are not limited to, the Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire [ATAQ], the Asth ma Control Questionnaire [ACQ], or the Asthma Control Test [ACT]. 11 The specifications of this numerator enable documentation for the impairment and risk components separately to facilitate quality improvement. Evaluation of asthma impairment and asthma ri sk must occur during the same medical encounter. Definition: Evaluation of Asthma Control - Documentation of an evaluation of asthma impairment which must include: daytime symptoms AND nighttime awakenings AND interference with normal activity AND shor t-acting beta2 -agonist use for symptom control AND documentation of asthma risk which must include the number of asthma exacerbations requiring oral systemic corticosteroids in the prior 12 months. Numerator Quality -Data Coding Options for Reporting Sati sfactorily: Performance Met: Asthma impairment assessed (CPT II 2015F) AND Performance Met: Asthma risk assessed (CPT II 2016F) AND Performance Met: Care plan updated (G8942) if required OR Performance Not Met: Asthma impairment not assessed, reason not otherwise specified (2015F with 8P) OR Performance Not Met: Asthma risk not assessed, reason not otherwise specified (2016F with 8P) OR Performance Not Met: No care plan was updated (G8543) if required RATIONALE: The goal of asthma therapy is to achieve asthma control. The level of asthma control serves as a basis for treatment modifica tion (ie, whether or not a patient needs a step up or step down in therapy). Patients with poorly control led asthma can experience significant asthma burden (Fuhlbrigge AL, 2002), decreased quality of life (Schatz M, 2005), and increased health utilization . (Vollmer WM, 2002; Schatz M, 2005) A large international study found that guideline -defined asthma cont rol can be achieved. In their trial, 30% of the patients achieved total control (defined as absence of asthma symptoms) and 60% achieve well -controlled asthma (defined as low -level of symptoms or rescue medication use. (Bateman ED, 2004) A follow -up to thi s study found that this control can be maintained, which can lead to a decrease in the use of unscheduled health care visits. (Bateman ED, 2008) CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines. The Expert Panel recommends that asthma control be defined as follows: (Evidence A) (NHLBI, 2007) Reduce Impairment Prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms (eg, coughing or breathlessness in the daytime, night, or after exertion) Require infrequent use ( 2 days a week) of SABA for quick relief of symptoms Maintain (near) \"normal\" pulmonary function Maintain normal activity levels (including exercise and other physical activity and attendance at work or school) Meet patients' and families' expectations of satisfaction with asthma care Reduce risk Prevent recurrent exacerbations of asthma and minimi ze the need for ED visits or hospitalizations Prevent progressive loss of lung function; for children, prevent reduced lung growth Provide optimal pharmacotherapy with minimal or no adverse effects The Expert Panel recommends that ongoing monitoring of asthma control be performed to determine whether all the goals of therapy are met \u2014that is reducing both impairment and risk. (Evidence B) (NHLBI, 2007) 12 The Expert Panel recommends that the frequency of visits to a clinician for a review of asthma contro l is a matter of clinical judgment; in general, patients who have intermittent or mild persistent asthma that has been under control for at least 3 mon ths should be seen by a physician about every 6 months, and patients who have uncontrolled and/or severe persistent asthma and those who need additional supervision to help them follow their treatment plan need to be seen more often. (NHLBI, 2007) The Expert Panel recommends that symptoms and clinical signs of asthma should be assessed at each health care v isit through physical examination and appropriate questions. (EPR -2, 1997) (NHLBI/NAEPP, 2007) The American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) and PCPI owned and developed measure, Asthma: Assessment of Asthma Control - Ambulatory Care Se tting. This measure is equivalent to former PQRS measure #64 with the exception of the modification to the upper age limit. 13 AAAAI17: Asthma Control: Minimal Important Difference Improvement - National Quality Strategy Domain: Person and Caregiver -Centered Experience and Outcomes MEASURE TYPE : Outcome HIGH PRIORITY/TYPE: YES, Outcome INVERSE MEASURE: NO PROPORTIONAL MEASURE: YES CONTINUOUS VARIABLE MEASURE: NO RATIO MEASURE: NO MEANINGFUL MEASURE AREA : Functional Outcomes RISK ADJUSTED: NO TELEHEALTH: YES # OF PERFORMANCE RATES REQ'D : 1 CARE SETTING : AMBULATORY CARE: CLINICIAN OFFICE/CLINIC DESCRIPTION: Percentage of patients aged 12 years and older whose asthma is not well-controlled as indicated by the Asthma Control Test, Asthma Control Questionnaire, or Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire and who demonstrated a minimal important difference improvement upon a subsequent office visit during the 12 -month reporting p eriod. INSTRUCTIONS: This outcomes measure e is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period for all patients with a diagnosis of asthma who demonstrate a score 19 on the Asthma Control Test (ACT), 1.5 on the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ ) or 1 on the Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire (ATAQ ) and who had at least one follow -up ACT, ACQ, or ATAQ within the 12 - month reporting period. In order to meet this measure, the patient must demonstrate a minimal importance difference (MID) impro vement between their asthma control score from the initial visit and a subsequent score taken during the 12 -month reporting period using the same patient -completed questionnaire. An increase in score by greater than or equal to 3 points on the ACT, decreas e in score by greater than or equal to .5 points on the ACQ or a decrease in score by greater than or equal to 1 point on the ATAQ will indicate a minimal importance difference improvement and a higher measure performance. This measure may be reported by c linicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the services provided and the measure -specific coding. Data Source: ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, CPT codes, patient demographics and medical record data are used to identify patients who are included in the measure's denominator. Medical record data and the listed numerator options are used to report the numerator of the mea sure. DENOMINATOR: All patients aged 12 years or older whose asthma is not well -controlled and who had at least one follow -up ACT, ACQ, or ATAQ within the 12 -month reporting period. Definition: For the purposes of t his measure, asthma that is not well-controlled will be defined by a score of 19 on the ACT, 1.5 on the ACQ or 1 on the ATAQ. Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): Patients aged 12 years on date of encounter AAAAI_17.DEN.1.YES AND Diagnosis was not well -controlled based on score of 19 on the ACT or 1.5 on the ACQ or 1 on the ATAQ at one visit AND At least one subsequent patient encounter during the reporting period with completion of the same asthma assessment patient -completed questionnaire (ACT, ACQ or ATAQ) who demonstrate a minimal important difference (MID) improvement using one of the following three asthma assessment patient -completed questionnaires: Change in the Asthma Control Test (ACT) by 3 points Change in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) by 0.5 points Change in Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire (ATAQ) by 1 point Numerator Options: Performance Met: MID i mprovement demonstrated, increase in score by 3 points on the ACT AAAAI_17.NUMER.1.YES OR Performance Met: MID i mprovement demonstrated, decrease in score by 0.5 points on the ACQ AAAAI_17.NUMER.2.YES OR Performance Met: MID i mprovement demonstrated, decrease in score by 1 point on the ATAQ AAAAI_17.NUMER.3.YES OR Medical Perform ance Exclusion : Medical reason(s) for patient not demonstrating MID improvement (eg, respiratory infection within 4 weeks of follow -up visit) AAAAI_17.NUMER.4.YES OR Patient Perform ance Exclusion : Patient reasons for not demonstrating MID improvement (eg, patients with poor adherence to controller therapy as determined by self -report or pharmacy records (per cent of days covered < 50 %)) AAAAI_17.NUMER.5.YES OR Perform ance Not Met: MID i mprovement NOT demonstrated, reason not otherwise specified AAAAI_17.NUMER.6.NO RATIONALE: Current asthma guidelines recommend assessing an asthma patient's level of control and emphasize that the goal of asthma therapy is to achieve control. Several v alidated asthma questionnaires can be used to assess control. In order to assess clinical improvement or worsening of asthma control in an individual or population overtime, the minimal important difference (MID) [a lso referred to as the minimal clinically important difference or MCID] can be used. The MID is defined as the smallest difference in score on the instrument that represents a clinically significant change (Schatz 2009). Lack of asthma control impairs quality of life and is a risk factor for su bsequent exacerbations. When control is not achieved, escalation of therapy is warranted to attain and maintain control. Schatz M, Kosinski M, Yarlas AS, Hanlon J, Watson ME, Jhingran P. The minimally important difference of the Asthma Control following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines: 15 Once treatment is started, the results of the measures of impairment and risk are used to monitor asthma control rather than severity. Monitoring the level of asthma control is used to adjust medication as needed. National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Guidelines Implementation Panel Report for: Expert Panel Report 3 \u2014 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma, 2008. Bethesda, MD: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, US Dept of Health and Human Services; 2008. Four instruments have established cutoff values for uncontrolled versus controlled asthma: ACQ score of 1.5 or greater, ACT score of 19 or less, ATAQ score of 1 or greater, and Childhood Asthma Control Test [cACT] score of 19 or less (US study). Two asthma control composite score instruments (ACQ and ACT) have been designated as core measures for the NIH -initiated clinical research in adults because of (1) the importance of ast hma control as a goal of therapy; (2) extensive validation data for these instruments, using the widest range of criterion and construct measures and including demonstration of responsiveness t o therapy and an MCID; and (3) low patient burden and risk. Cloutier MM, Schatz M, Castro M, Clark N, Kelly HW, Mangione -Smith R, et al. Asthma outcomes: composite scores Dif ference Improvement measure was developed by the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI). The measure is not a clinical guideline, does not establish a standard of medical care, and ha s not been tested for all potential applications.

INSTRUCTIONS: This outcomes measure is to be reported once per reporting period when a patient seen during the reporting period receiving subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy for at least one standardized extract achieves the projected effective dose after one yea r of treatment. This measure is intended to reflect the quality of servi ces provided for patients undergoing allergen immunotherapy. This measure may be reported by clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the services provided and the measure -specific denominator coding.

The maintenance concentrate vial is the highest concentration allergy immunotherapy vial (eg, 1:1 vol/vol vial). The proje cted effective dose is called the maintenance goal. Some subjects unable to tolerate the projected effective dose will experience clinical benefits at a lower dose. The maintenance dose is the dose tha t provides therapeutic efficacy without significant adv erse local or systemic reactions and might not always reach the initially calculated projected effective dose. This reinforces that allergy immunotherapy must be individualized. 1 1Cox L, Nelson H, Lockey R, Calabria C, Chacko T, Finegold I, Nelson M, Web er R, Bernstein DI, Blessing -Moore J, Khan DA, Lang DM, Nicklas RA, Oppenheimer J, Portnoy JM, Randolph C, Schuller DE, Spector SL, Tilles S, Wallace D.

INSTRUCTIONS: This outcomes measure is to be reported once per reporting period for all patients with a penicillin or ampicillin/amoxicill in allergy label in the medical record who are seen during the reporting period. Patients with a history of penicillin allergy w ithout preceding skin testing, in vitro testing or antibiotic challenge will qualify for the measure denominator. For the purpos es of this measure, a \"penicillin allergy\" will only include natural penicillins or aminopenicillins , ampicillin and amoxicillin. A discussion regarding the risks and benefits of elective skin testing or penicillin challenge should take place with the pati ent or their caregiver/guardian. If the patient has previously declined skin testing or antibiotic challenge, they can be exempt from the measure numerator. In order to meet the numerator of this measure, skin testing or antibiotic challenge results should be reviewed and documented in the medical record. Further, the penicillin allergy label should be removed if results are negativ e or confirmed if positive. This measure may be reported by clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the services provided and the measure -specific coding. Measure Reporting via Registry: ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, CPT codes, patient demographics, and medical record data are used to identify patients who are included in the measure's denominator. Medical record data and the listed numerator options are used to report the numerator of the measure. DENOMINATOR: All patients, regardless of age, with a diagnosis of primary p enicillin or ampicillin/amoxicillin allergy seen during the reporting period Definition: Penicillin Allergy - For the purposes of this measure, a \"penicillin allergy\" will only include a history of allergy to natural penicillins (penicillin G and penicil lin V) OR aminopenicillins (ampicillin and amoxicillin). Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): All patients regardless of age AND Adverse effect of penicillins (ICD -10-CM): T36.0X5A, T36.0X5D, T36.0X5S Allergy status to penicillin underwent elective skin testing or penicillin challenge AND who had the penicillin or ampicillin/amoxicillin all ergy label removed from the medical record if resu lts were negative or confirmed i n the medical record if results were positive. NUMERATOR NOTE: A positive result consists of either a positive skin test or positive challenge after a negative skin test. Numerator Options Performance Met: Patient underwent elective skin testing or penicillin challenge AND had the penicillin or ampicillin/amoxicillin allergy label removed from the medical record if resu lts were negative or confirmed i n the medical record if results were positive AAAAI_18.NUMER.1.YE S OR Medical Performance Exclusion: Medical reason(s) for not documenting and reviewing (eg, previous positive penicillin skin test, patients with severe anaphylaxis to penicillin with in the past 5 years, patients with penicillin reaction histories consis tent with severe non -IgE-mediated reactions, significant comorbid disease and patients unable to discontinue medications with antihistaminic effects or beta -blockers) AAAAI_18.NUMER.2.YES OR Patient Performance Exclusion: Patient reason(s) for not docum enting and reviewing results (eg, patients who decline or are non -adherent with skin testing/challenge recommendations ) AAAAI_18.NUMER.3.YES OR Performance Not Met: Patient did NOT undergo elective skin testing/penicillin challenge and did not have the penicillin or ampicillin/amoxicillin allergy label removed or confirmed on the medical record, reason not otherwise specified AAAAI_18.NUMER.4.NO RATIONALE: Most patients with a diagnosis of penicillin allergy are not allergic to penicillin. The avoidance of penicillin and related beta -lactam antibiotics may result in use of antibiotics that are less effective, more costly or more toxic. Additionally, rapid penicill in desensitizat ion may be pursued unnecessarily, which also results in higher costs. In regards to exclusions, testing for penicillin requires the ability to test without concomitant use of a medicine with anti histaminic effects. Severe non -IgE-mediated penicillin react ions cannot be diagnosed via penicillin skin testing. Patients with significant comorbid diseases may be at higher risk of reaction due to skin testing and challenge. Also, should the patient be on a beta - blocker and unable to withhold before challenge thi s could be exclusion. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines: Summary Statement 54: The most useful test for detecting IgE -mediated drug reactions caused by penici llin and many large - molecular -weight biologicals is immediate hypersensitivity skin testing. (B) Summary Statement 71: Approximately 10% of patients report a history of penicillin allergy, but after complete evaluation, up to 90% of these individuals are able to tolerate penicillins. (B) Summary Statement 72: Treatment of patients assumed to be penicillin allergic with alternate broad -spectrum antibiotics may compromise optimal medical care by leading to multiple drug -resistant organisms, higher costs, an d increased toxic effects. (C) 22 Summary Statement 73: Evaluation of patients with penicillin allergy by skin testing leads to reduction in the use of broad - spectrum antibiotics and may decrease costs.

This measure is to be reported once for each occurrence for patients with acute sinusitis during the performance period. Measure Reporting : The listed denominator criteria is used to identify the intended patient population. The numerator options included in this specification are used to submit the quality actions allowed by the measure. The quality -data codes listed do not need to be submitted for registry -based submissions; however, these codes may be submitted for those registries that utilize claims data. DENOMINATOR: All patients ag ed 18 years and older with a diagnosis of acute sinusitis Definitions: Acute Sinusitis/Rhinosinusitis - Up to 4 weeks of purulent nasal drainage (anterior, posterior, or both) accompanied facial pain-pressure -fullness, or both: Purulent nasal discharge is cloudy or colored, in contrast to the clear secretions that typically accompany viral upper respiratory infection, and may be reported by the patient or observed on physical examination. Nasal obstruction may be reported by the patient as nasal obstruction, congestion, blockage, or stuffiness, or may be diagnosed by physical examination Facial pain -pressure -fullness may involve the anterior face, periorbital region, or manifest with headache that is localized or diffuse Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): Patients aged 18 years on date of encounter AND Diagnosis for 02 NUMERATOR: Patients prescribed any antibiotic within 10 days after onset of symptoms Numerator Instructions: INVERSE MEASURE - A lower calculated performance rate for this measure indicates better clinical care or control. The \"Performance Not Met\" numerator option for this measure is the representation of the better clinical quality or 24 control. Reporting that numerator option will produce a performance rate that trends closer to 0%, as quality increases. For inverse measures a rate of 100% means all of the denominator eligible patients did not receive the appropriate care or were not in proper control. Numerator Options: Performance Met: Antibi otic regimen prescribed within 10 days after onset of symptoms (G9286) OR Other Performance Exclusion : Antibiotic regimen prescribed within 10 days after onset of symptoms for documented medical reason (G9505) OR Performance Not Met: Antibiotic regimen not prescribed within 10 after onset of symptoms (G9287) RATIONALE: Antibiotic treatment for sinusitis is indicated for some patients, but overtreatment of acute sinusitis with antibiotics is common and often not indicated. Further, treatment with antibiotics may increase patient harm and can lead to antibiotic resistance. A 2012 Cochrane systema tic review was undertaken to assess the effect of antibiotics in adults with clinically diagnosed rhinosinusitis in primary care settings. Acute rhinosinusitis is a common condition that involves blockage of the nose passag e and mucus in the sinuses. It is often caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection of which only 0.5% to 2% of cases are estimated to be complicated by a bacterial rhinosinusitis. Nevertheless, antibiotics (used to treat bacterial infections) are often prescribed. Unnecessary pre scribing contributes to antimicrobial resistance in the community. The authors concluded that given the lack of clear benefit in terms of rapid recovery and the increase in side effects in participants treated with antibiotic s, antibiotics are not recommen ded as first line treatment in adults with clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines: AAO -HNS Sinusitis Guideline (2015) Clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and non -infectious conditions. A clinician should diagnose ABRS when (a) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis (purulent nasal drainage accompanies by nasal obstruction, facial pain -pressure -fullness, or both) persist without evidence of improvement for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or (b) symptoms or signs of acut e rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening). Strong recommendation based on diagnostic studies with minor limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm . The purpose of this statement is to emphasize the importance of differentiating acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from ac ute rhinosinusitis (ARS) caused by viral upper respiratory infections to prevent unnecessary treatment with antibiotics. Distingu ishing presumed bacterial vs. viral infection is important because antibiotic therapy is inappropriate for the latter. A quality improvement opportunity addressed by this guideline key action statement is the avoidance of inappropriate use of antibiotics fo r presumed viral infections. More than one in five antibiotics prescribed in adults are for sinusitis, making it the fifth most common diagnosis responsible for antibiotic therapy.

This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per performance period for patients with acute bacterial sinusitis during the performance period. Measure Reporting: The listed denominator criteria is used to identify the intended patient population.

The quality -data codes listed do not need to be submitted for registry -based submissions; however, these codes may be submitted for those registries that utilize claims data. DENOMINATOR: All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis who are prescribed an antibiotic. Definitions: Acute Bacterial Rhinosinusitis (ABRS) - Acute rhinosinusitis that is caused by, or is presumed to be caused by, bacterial infection. A clinician should diagnose ABRS when: (a) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis are present 10 days or more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or (b) symptoms or sig ns of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening) Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): Patients aged 18 years on date of encounter AND Diagnosis for 02 AND Sinusitis caused by, or presumed to be caused by, bacterial infection: G9364 AND Antibiotic regimen prescribed: G9498 NUMERATOR: Patients who were prescribed amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, as a first line antibiotic at the time of diagnosis Numerator Options: Performance Met: Amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, prescribed as a first line antibiotic at the time of diagnosis (G9315) 27 OR Other Performance Exclusion: Amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, not prescribed as first line antibiotic at the time of d iagnosis f or documented reason (G9313) OR Performance Not Met: Amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, not prescribed as first line antibiotic at the time of diagnosis, reason not given (G9314) RATIONALE: The rationale for antibiotic therapy of ABRS is to eradicate bacterial infection from the sinuses, hasten resolution of symptoms, and enhance disease -specific quality of life. Antibiotic therapy should be efficacious, cost -effective, and result in minimal side effects. The justification for amoxicillin as first-line therapy for most patients with ABRS relates to its safety, efficacy, low cost, and narrow microbiologic spectrum. Consideration to prescribing amoxicillin -clavulanate for adults with ABRS is given to those at a high risk of being infected by an organism resistant to amoxicillin. Factors that would prompt clinicians to consider prescribing amoxicillin - clavulanate instead of amoxicillin include: Situations in which bacterial resistance is likely (e.g. antibiotic use in the past month; close contact with treated individuals, health care providers, or a health care environment; failure of prior antibiotic therapy; breakthrough infection despite prophylaxis; close contact with a child in a daycare facility; smoker or smoker in the family; high prevalen ce of resistant bacteria in community) Presence of moderate to severe infection (e.g. moderate to severe symptoms of ABRS; protracted symptoms of ABRS; frontal or sphenoidal sinusitis, history of recurrent ABRS) Presence of comorbidity or extremes of life (e.g. comorbid conditions including diabetes; chronic cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease; immunocompromised patient; age greater than 65 years) The use of high -dose amoxicillin with clavulanate is recommended for adults with ABRS who are at a high risk of being infected with an amoxicillin -resistant organism. High -dose amoxicillin is preferred over standard -dose amoxicillin primarily to cover penicillin non susceptible (PNS) S. pneumoniae. This risk exists in those from geographic regions with high endemic rates (>10%) of invasive PNS S. pneumoniae, those with severe infection (e.g., evidence of systemic toxicity with fever of 39C (102 F) or higher, and threat of supportive complications), age >65 years, recent hospitalization, antibiotic use within the past month, or those who are immunocompromised. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines: AAO -HNS Sinusitis Guideline (2015) If a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first -line therapy for most adults. Recommendation based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneity and non -inferiority design with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The purpose of this statement is to promote prescribing of antibiotics with known efficacy and safety for ABRS and to reduce prescribing of antibiotics with potentially inferior efficacy because of more limited coverage of the usual pathogens that cause ABRS in adults. A secondary goal is to promote cost -effective antibiotic therapy for ABRS. A quality improvement opportunity addressed by this guideline key action statement is discouraging initial prescribing of antibiot ics other than amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, that may have low efficacy or have comparable efficacy but more adverse events. IDSA Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Bacterial Rhinosinusitis in Children and Adults (2012) Amoxicillin -clavula nate rather than amoxicillin alone is recommended as empiric antimicrobial therapy for ABRS in adults (weak, low). Evidence for at least 1 critical outcome from observational studies, from RCTs with serious flaws or indirect evidence. 28 COPYRIGHT: The Measures are not clinical guidelines, do not establish a standard of medical care, and have not been tested for all poten tial applications.

Claims data will be analyzed to determine unique occurrences. This measure may be reported by eligible clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the s ervices provided and the measure -specific denominator coding. Measure Submission : The listed denominator criteria is used to identify the intended patient population. The numerator options included in this specification are used to submit the quality ac tions allowed by the measure. The quality -data codes listed do not need to be submitted for registry -based submissions; however, these codes may be submitted for those registries that utilize claims data. DENOMINATOR : Children 3 months through 18 years of age who had an outpatient or emergency department (ED) visit with only a diagnosis of upper respiratory infection (URI) during the measurement period Denominator Instructions: To determine eligibility, look for any of the listed antibiotic drugs below in the 30 days prior to the visit with the URI diagnosis. As long as there are no prescriptions for the listed antibiotics during this time period, the patient is eligible for denominator inclusion. Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): Patients aged 3 months through 18 years on date of encounter AND Diagnosis for URI (ICD -10-CM): J00, J06.0, J06.9 AND Patient or dispensed antibiotic for documented medical reason(s) (e.g., intestinal in fection, pertussis, bacterial infection, Lyme disease, otitis media, acute sinusitis, acute pharyngitis, acute of the ac ute staph infections, pneumonia/gonococcal infections, venereal disease (syphilis, chlamydia, inflammatory diseases [female reproductive organs]), infections of the kidney, cystitis or UTI, and acne: G8709 OR Children wh o are taking antibiotics in the 30 days prior to the date of the encounter during which the diagnosis was established: G9701 OR Patients who use hospice services any time during the measurement period: G9700 NUMERATOR: Children without a prescription for antibiotic medication on or 3 days after the outpatient or ED visit for an upper respiratory infection. 30 Numerator Instructions: For performance, the measure will be calcul ated as the number of patient's encounter(s) where antibiotics we re neither prescribed nor dispensed on or within three days of the episode for URI over the total number of encounters in the denominator (patients aged 3 months through 18 years with an outpatient or ED visit for URI. A higher score indicates appropriat e treatment of patients with URI (e.g., the proportion for whom antibiotics were not prescribed or dispensed following the episode). Table 1 - Antibiotic Medications Numerator Options: Performance Met: Patient not prescribed or dispensed anti biotic (G8708) OR Performance Not Met: Patient prescribed or dispensed antibiotic (G8710) 31 RATIONALE: Most upper respiratory infections (URI), also known as the common cold, are caused by viruses that require no antibiotic treatment. Too often, antibiotics are prescribed inappropriately, which can lead to antibiotic resistance (when antibiotics can no longer cure bacterial infections). Pediatric ambulatory visits to physicians account for nearly 50 million antibiotic prescri ptions annually in the U.S. The total economic impact of treating URIs is close to $17 billion per year in direct costs. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: American Family Physician (Wong, Blumberg, and Lowe 2006) A diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should b e considered in patients with symptoms of a viral upper respiratory infection that have not improved after 10 days or that worsen after five to seven days. (C) Treatment of sinus infection with antibiotics in the first week of symptoms is not recommended. (C) Telling patients not to fill an antibiotic prescription unless symptoms worsen or fail to improve after several days can reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics.

Claims data will be analyzed to determ ine unique occurrences. This measure is intended to reflect the quality of services provided for the primary management of patients with pharyngitis who were dispensed an antibiotic. This measure may be reported by eligible clinicians who perform the quali ty actions described in the measure based on the services provided and the measure -specific denominator coding. Measure Submission : The listed denominator criteria is used to identify the intended patient population. The numerator options included in this specification are used to submit the quality actions allowed by the measure. The quality -data codes listed do not need to be submitted for registry -based submissions; however, these codes may be submitted for those registries that utilize claims data. DENOMINATOR: Children 3 through 18 years of age who had an outpatient or emergency department (ED) visit with a diagnosis of pharyngitis during the measurement period and an antibiotic ordered on or three days after the visit Denominator Instructions: To determine eligibility, look for any of the listed antibiotic drugs below in the 30 days prior to the visit with the pharyngitis diagnosis. As long as there are no prescriptions for the listed antibiotics during this tim e period, the patient is eligible fo r denominator inclusion. DENOMINATOR NOTE: *Signifies that this CPT Category I code is a non -covered service under the Medicare Part B Physician Fee Schedule (PFS). These non -covered services should be counted in the denominator population for registry -based measures. Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): Patients aged 3 through 18 years on date of encounter AND Diagnosis AND NOT DENOMINATOR EXCLUSIONS: Patients who use hospice services any time during the measurement period: G9702 OR Children who are taking antibiotics in the 30 days prior to the diagnosis of pharyngitis: G9703 33 Table 1 - Antibio tic Medications NUMERATOR: Children with a group A streptococcus test in the 7 -day period from 3 days prior throu gh 3 days after the pharyngitis Numerator Instructions: For performance, the measure will be calculated as the number of patient encounter s where diagnosed with pharyngitis, dispensed an antibiotic and received a group A streptococcus (strep) test for the episode over the total number of encounters in the denominator (patients aged 3 through 18 years with an outpatient or ED visit and an antibiotic ordered on or three days after the visit). A higher score indicates appropriate treatment of children with pharyngit is (e.g., the proportion for whom antibiotics were prescribed with an accompanying step test). Numerator Options: Performance Met: Group A Strep Test Performed (3210F) OR Performance Not Met: Group A Strep Test not Performed, reason not otherwise specified (3210F with 8P) RATIONALE: Group A streptococcal bacterial infections and other infections that cause pharyngitis (which are most often viral) often pro duce the same signs and sympto ms (IDSA 2002). The American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and 34 Prevention, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America all recommend a diagnostic test for Strep A to improve diagnostic accuracy and avoid unnecessary antibiotic t reatment (Linder et al. 2005). Estimated economic costs of pediatric streptococcal pharyngitis in the United States range from $224 million to $539 million per year, including indirect costs related to parental work losses. At a higher level, the economic cost of antibiotic resistance vary but have extended as high as $20 billion in excess direct healthcare costs, with additional costs to society for lost productivit y as high as $35 billion a year (2008 dollars) (Roberts et al. 2009).

This measure is intended to determine whether or not all patients aged 6 months and older received (either from the submitting Merit -based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) eligible clinician or from an alternate care provider) the influenza immunization dur ing the flu season. There is no diagnosis associated with this measure. This measure may be submitted by MIPS eligible clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the services provided and the measure -specific denominator c oding. If submitting this measure between January 1, 202 1 and March 31, 202 1, quality -data code G8482 should be submitted when the influenza immunization is administered to the patient during the months of August, September, October, November, and December of 20 20 or January, February, and March of 202 1 for the flu season ending March 31, 202 1. If submitt ing this measure between October 1, 202 1 and December 31, 202 1, quality -data code G8482 should be submitted when the influenza immunization is administered to the patient during the months of August, September, October, November, and December of 2020 for t he flu season ending March 31, 202 2. Influenza immunizations administered during the month of August or September of a given flu season (either 20 20- 2021 flu season OR 202 1-2022 flu season) can be submitted when a visit occurs during the flu season (Octobe r 1 - March 31). In these cases, G8482 should be submitted . Measure Submission: Measure data may be submitted by individual MIPS eligible clinicians, groups, or third party intermediaries. The listed denominator criteria are used to identify the intended patient population. The numerator options included in this specification are used to submit the quality actions as allowed by the measure. The quality -data codes listed do not need to be submitted by MIPS eligible clinicians, groups, or third part y intermediaries that utilize this modality for submissions; however, these codes may be submitted for those third party intermediaries that utilize Medicare Part B claims data. For more information regarding Application Programming Interface (API), please refer to the Quality Payment Program (QPP) website. DENOMINATOR: All patients aged 6 months and older seen for a visit during the measurement period DENOMINATOR NOTE: For the purposes of the program, in order to submit on the flu season 20 20-2021, the patient must have a qualifying encounter between January 1 and March 31, 202 1. In order to submit on the flu season 202 1- 2022, the patient must have a qualifying encounter between October 1 and December 31, 202 1. A qualifying encounter needs to occur w ithin the flu season that is being submitted; any additional encounter(s) may occur at any time within the measurement period. *Signifies that this CPT Category I code is a non -covered service under the Medicare Part B Physician Fee Schedule (PFS). These non-covered services should be counted in the denominator population for MIPS CQMs. Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): Patients aged 6 months 36 AND Patient encounter during January thru March and/or October thru December 02 NUMERATOR: Patients who received an influenza immunization OR who reported previous receipt of an influenza immunization Definition: Previous Receipt - Receipt of the current season's influenza immunization from another provider OR from same provider prior to the visit to which the measure is applied (typically, prior vaccination would include influenza vaccine given since August 1st). Numerator Instructions: The numerator for this measure can be met by submitting either administration of an influenza vaccination or that the patient reported previous receipt of the current season's influenza immunization. If the performance of the numer ator is not met, a MIPS eligible clinician can submit a valid denominator exception for having not administered an influenza vaccination. For MIPS eligible clinicians submitting a denominator exception for this measure, there should be a clear rationale an d documented reason for not administering an influenza immunization if the patient did not indicate previous receipt, which could include a medical reason (e.g., patient allergy), patient reason (e.g., patient declined), or system reason (e.g., vaccination not available). The system reason should be indicated only for cases of disruption or shortage of influenza vaccination supply. Due to the changing nature of the CDC/ACIP recommendations regarding the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) for a partic ular flu season, this measure will not include the administration of this specific formulation of the flu vaccination. Given the variance of the timeframes for the annual update cycles, program implementation, and publication of revised recommendations fro m the CDC/ACIP, it has been determined that the coding for this measure will specifically exclude this formulation, so as not to inappropriately include this form of the vaccine for flu seasons when CDC/ACIP explicitly advise against it. However, it is rec ommended that all eligible professionals or eligible clinicians review the guidelines for each flu season to determine appropriateness of the LAIV and other formulations of the flu vaccine. Should the LAIV be recommended for administration for a particular flu season, an eligible professional or clinician may consider one of the following options: 1) satisfy the numerator by reporting previous receipt, 2) report a denominator exception, either as a patient reason (e.g., for patient preference) or a system r eason (e.g., the institution only carries LAIV). NUMERATOR NOTE : Denominator Exception(s) are determined at the time of the denominator eligible encounter during the current flu season. Numer ator Quality -Data Coding Option : Performance Met: Influenza immunization administered or previously received ( G8482) OR Denominator Exceptions : Influenza immunization was not administered for reasons documented by clinician (e.g., patient allergy or other medical reasons, patient de clined or other patient reasons, vaccine not available or other system reasons) (G8483) OR 37 Performance Not Met: Influenza immunization as not administered, reason not given (G8484) RATIONALE: Influenza vaccination is the most effective protection against influenza virus infection (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2018). Influenza may lead to serious complications including hospitalization or death (CDC, 2018). Influenz a vaccine is recommended for all persons ag ed >= 6 months who do not have contraindications to vaccination. However, data indicate that less than half of all eligible individuals receive an influenza vaccination (CDC, 2015). This measure promotes annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged >= 6 months. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines. Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged >=6 months who do not have contraindic ations. Optimally, vaccination should occur before onset of influenza activity in the community. Although vaccination by the end of October is recommended, vaccine administered in December or later, even if influenza activity has already begun, is likely t o be beneficial in the majority of influenza seasons (CDC/Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP], 2018).

The quality -data codes listed do not need to be submitted for registry -based submissions; however, these codes may be submitted for those regi stries that utilize claims data . DENOMINATOR: Patients 65 years of age and older with a visit during the measurement period DENOMINATOR NOTE: This measure assesses whether patients 65 years of age or older have received one or more pneumococcal vaccinations. Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): Patients aged 65 years on date of encounter AND Patient encounter during the performance period (CPT services any time during the measurement period: G9707 NUMERATOR: Patients who have ever received a pneumococcal vaccination NUMERATOR NOTE: While the measure provides credit for adults 65 years of age and older who have ever received either the PCV13 or PPSV23 vaccine (or both), according to ACIP recommendations, patients should receive bot h vaccines. The order and timing of the vaccinations depends on certain patient characteristics, and are described in more detail in the ACIP recommendations. Numerator Quality -Data Coding Options: Performance Met: Pneumococcal vaccine administered or previously received (4040F) OR Performance Not Met: Pneumococcal vaccine was not administered or previously received, reason not otherwise specified ( 4040F with 8P) RATIONALE : Pneumonia is a common cause o f illness and death in the elderly and persons with certain underlying conditions such as heart failure, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, asthma, sickle cell anemia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (NHLBI, 2011). In 19 98, an estimated 3,400 adults aged > 65 years died as a result of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) (CDC, 2003). Among the 91.5 million US adults aged > 50 years, 29,500 cases of IPD, 502,600 cases of nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 25,400 pneumococcal -related deaths are estimate d to occur yearly; annual direct and indirect costs are 39 estimated to total $3.7 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. Pneumococcal disease remains a substantial burden among older US adults, despite increased coverage with 23 -valent pneumococcal polysacc haride vaccine, (PPV23) and indirect benefits afforded by PCV7 vaccination of young children (Weycker, et al., 2011). Vaccination has been found to be effective against bacteremic cases (OR: 0.34; 0.39 -0.86). Vaccine effectiveness was types (OR: 0.24; 95% CI: -0.66) (Vila -Corcoles, et al., 2009). CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: In 2014, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) began recommending a dose of 13 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) be followed by a dose of 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) 6 -12 months later in adults aged 65 and older who have not previously received a pneumococcal vaccination, and in persons over the age of two years who are considered to be at higher risk for pneumococcal disease due to an underlying condition. The two vaccines should not be coadministere d and intervals for administration of the two vaccines vary slightly depending on the age, risk group, and history of vaccination (Kobayashi, 2015). In 2015, ACIP updated its recommendation and changed the interval between PCV13 and PPSV23, from 6 -12 mont hs to at least one year for immunocompetent adults aged >=65 years who have not previously received pneumococcal vaccine. For immunocompromised vaccine -na\u00efve adults, the minimum acceptable interval between PCV13 and PPSV23 is 8 weeks. Both immunocompetent and immunocompromised adults aged >=65 years who have previously received a dose of PPSV23 when over the age of 65 should receive a dose of PCV13 at least one year after PPSV23 (>=1 year). Immunocompetent and immunocompromised adults aged >=65 who have pre viously received a dose of PPSV23 when under the age of 65, should also receive a dose of PCV13 at least one year after PPSV23 (>=1 year) and then another dose of PPSV23 at least one year after PCV13. It is recommended that for those that have this alterna tive three -dose schedule (2 PPSV23 and 1 PCV13), the three doses should be spread over a time period of five or more years (Kobayashi, 2015).

This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per performance period for patients seen during the performance period. This measure may be reported by eligible clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the services provided at the time of the qualifying visit and the measure - specific denominator coding. The BMI may be documented in the medical record of the provider or in outside medical records obtained by the provider. If the most recent documented BMI is outside of normal parameters, then a follow -up plan must be documented during the encounter or during the previous six months of the current encou nter. The documented follow -up plan must be based on the most recent document MI outside of normal parameters, example: \"Patient referred to nutrition counseling for BMI above or below normal parameters\" (See Definitions for examples of follow -up plan trea tments). If more than one BMI is reported during the measure period, the most recent BMI will be used to determine if the performance has been met.

The prevalence of overweight and obese people is increasing worldwide at an alarming rate in both developing and developed countries. Environmental and behavioral changes brought about by economic development, modernization and urbanization have been linked to the rise in global obesity. The health consequences are becoming apparent (ICSI 2013. p.6). Nationally, nearly 38 percent of adults are obese [NHANES, 2013 -2014 data]. Nearly 8 percent of adults are extremely obese (BMI greater than or equal to 40.0); Obesity rates are higher among women (40.4 percent) compared to men (35.0 percent). Between 2005 and 2014, the difference in obesity among women was 5.1 percent higher among women and 1.7 percent higher among men. Women are also almost twice as likely (9.9 percent) to be extremely obese compared to men (5.5 percent); In addition, rates are the highest among middle -age adults (41 percent for 40 - to 59-year-olds), compared to 34.3 percent of 20 to 39-year-olds and 38.5 percent of adults ages 60 and older (Flegal KM, Kruszon -Moran D, Carroll MD, et al, 2016, p.2286 -2290). Obesity is one of the biggest drivers of preventable chronic diseases and healthcare costs in the United States. Currently, estimates for these costs range from $147 billion to nearly $210 billion per year (Cawley J and Meyerhoefer C., 2012 & Finkelstein, Trogdon, Cohen, et al., 2009). There are significant racial and ethnic ine quities [NHANES, 2013 -2014 data]: Obesity rates are higher among Blacks (48.4 percent) and Latinos (42.6 percent) than among Whites (36.4 percent) and Asian Americans (12.6 percent).The inequities are highest among women: Blacks have a rate of 57.2 percent , Latinos of 46.9 percent, Whites of 38.2 percent and Asians of 12.4 percent. For men, Latinos have a rate of 37.9 percent, Blacks of 38.0 percent and Whites of 34.7 percent. Black women (16.8 percent) are twice as likely to be extremely obese as White wom en (9.7 percent) (Flegal KM, Kruszon -Moran D, Carroll MD, et al., 2016, pp. 2284 -2291). 43 BMI continues to be a common and reasonably reliable measurement to identify overweight and obese adults who may be at an increased risk for future morbidity. Although good quality evidence supports obtaining a BMI, it is important to recognize it is not a perfect measurement. BMI is not a direct measure of adiposity and as a consequence it can over - or underestimate adiposity. BMI is a derived value that correlates well with total body fat and markers of secondary complications, e.g., hypertension and dyslipidemia (Barlow, 2007). In contrast with waist circumference, BMI and its associated disease and mortality risk appear to vary among ethnic subgro ups. Female African American populations appear to have the lowest mortality risk at a BMI of 26.2 -28.5 kg/m2 and 27.1 -30.2 kg/m2 for women and men, respectively. In contrast, Asian populations may experience lowest mortality rates starting at a BMI of 23 to 24 kg/m2. The correlation between BMI and diabetes risk also varies by ethnicity (LeBlanc, 2011. p.2 -3). Screening for BMI and follow -up therefore is critical to closing this gap and contributes to quality goals of population health and cost reduction. However, due to concerns for other underlying conditions (such as bone health) or nutrition related deficiencies providers are cautioned to use clinical judgment and take these into account when considering weight management programs for overweight patien ts, especially the elderly (NHLBI Obesity Education Initiative, 1998, p. 91) BMI below Normal Parameters On the other end of the body weight spectrum is underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), which is equally detrimental to population health. When compared to no rmal weight individuals(BMI 18.5 -25 kg/m2), underweight individuals have significantly higher death rates with a Hazard Ratio of 2.27 and 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.78, 2.90 (Borrell & Lalitha (2014). Poor nutrition or underlying health conditions can result in underweight (Fryer & Ogden, 2012). The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) results from the 2007 -2010 indicate that women are more likely to be underweight than men (2012). Therefore patients should be equally screened f or underweight and followed up with nutritional counselling to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with underweight. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: As cited in Fetch et al. (2013), The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) Health Ca re Guideline, Prevention and Management of Obesity for Adults provides the Strength of Recommendation as Strong for the following: - Record height, weight and calculate body mass index at least annually - Clinicians should consider waist circumference mea surement to estimate disease risk for patients who have normal or overweight BMI scores. For adult patients with a BMI of 25 to 34.9 kg/m2, sex -specific waist circumference cutoffs should be used in conjunction with BMI to identify increased disease risk. Individuals who are overweight (BMI 25<30), and who do not have indicators of increased CVD risk (e.g., diabetes, pre -diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, elevated waist circumference) or other obesity -related comorbidities and individuals who have a history of overweight and are now normal weight with risk factors at acceptable levels: \"Advise to frequently measure their own weight, and to avoid weight gain by adjusting their food intake if they start to gain more than a few pounds. Also, advi se patient s that engaging in regular physical activity will help them avoid weight gain.\" (2013 AHA/AAC/TOS Obesity Guideline, p. S113) USPSTF Clinical Guideline (Grade B Recommendation) Individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or higher should be offered or referred to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions that include the following components: Behavioral management activities, such as setting weight -loss goals Improving diet or nutrition and increasing physical activity Addressi ng barriers to change Self -monitoring Strategizing how to maintain lifestyle changes Nutritional safety for the elderly should be considered when recommending weight reduction. \"A clinical decision to forego obesity treatment in older adults should be guided by an evaluation of the potential benefits of weight reduction for day -to-day functioning and reduction of the risk of future cardiovascular events, as well as the patient's motivation for weight reducti on. Care 44 must be taken to ensure that any wei ght reduction program minimizes the likelihood of adverse effects on bone health or other aspects of nutritional status\" Evidence Category D. (NHLBI Obesity Education Initiative, 1998, p. 91). In addition, weight reduction prescriptions in older persons sh ould be accompanied by proper nutritional counseling and regular body weight monitoring. (NHLBI Obesity Education Initiative, 1998, p. 91). The possibility that a standard approach to weight loss will work differently in diverse patient populations must b e considered when setting expectations about treatment outcomes.

This list must include ALL known prescriptions, over -the-counters, herbals, and vitamin/mineral/dietary (nutritional) supplements AND must contain the medications' name, dosage, frequency and route of administration. INSTRUCTIONS : This measure is to be submitted at each denominator eligible visit during the 12 month performance period. Eligible clinicians meet the intent of this measure by making their best effort to document a current, complete and accurate medication list duri ng each encounter. There is no diagnosis associated with this measure. This measure may be submitted by eligible clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the services provided and the measure -specific denominator coding. Measure Submission: The listed denominator criteria is used to identify the intended patient population. The numerator options included in this specification are used to submit the quality actions allowed by the measure. The quality -data codes listed do not need to be submitted for regi stry submissions; however, these codes may be submitted for those registries that utilize claims data. DENOMINATOR : All visits for patients aged 18 years and older Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): Patients aged 18 years on date of encounter AND Patient encounter during the performance period to documenting, updating or reviewing a patient's current medications using all resources available on the date of encounter. This list must include ALL known prescriptions, over -the counters, herbals, and vitamin/mineral/dietary (nutritional) sup plements AND must contain the medications' name, dosages, frequency and route of administration. Definitions : Current Medications - Medications the patient is presently taking including all prescriptions, over -the- counters, herbals and vitamin/mineral/d ietary (nutritional) supplements with each medication's name, dosage, frequency and administered route. Route - Medications the patient is presently taking including all prescriptions, over -the- counters, herbals and vitamin/mineral/dietary (nutritional) supplements with each medication's name, dosage, frequency and administered route. Not Eligible (Denominator Exception) - A patient is not eligible if the following reason is documented: Patient is in an urgent or emer gent medical situation where time is of the essence and to delay treatment would jeopardize the patient's health status on the date of the encounter 46 NUMERATOR NOTE: The eligible clinician must document in the medical record they obtained, updated, or revie wed a medication list on the date of the encounter. Eligible clinicians submitting this measure may document medication information received from the patient, authorized representative(s), caregiver(s) or other available healthcare resources. By submitting the action described in this measure, the provider attests to having documented a list of current medications utilizing all immediate resources available at the time of the encounter. G8427 should be submitted if the eligible clinician documented that the patient is not currently taking any medications Numerator Quality -Data Coding Options for Reporting Satisfactorily: Performance Met: Eligible clinician attests to documenting in the medical record they obtained, updated, or reviewed the patient's current medications (G8427) OR Denominator Exception : Eligible clinician attests to documenting in the medical record the patient is not eligible for a current list of medications being obtained, updated, or reviewed by the eligible clinician (G8430) OR Performance Not Met: Current list of medications not documented as obt ained, updated, or reviewed by the eligible clinician , reason not given (G8428) RATIONALE: Maintaining an accurate and complete medication list has proven to be a challenging documentation endeavor for various health care provider settings. While most of outpatient encounters (2/3) result in providers prescribing at least one medication, ho spita ls have been the focus of medication safety efforts (Stock et al., 2009). Nassaralla et al. (2007) caution that this is at odds with the current trend, where patients with chronic illnesses are increasingly being treated in the outpatient setting and requi re careful monitoring of multiple medications. Additionally Nassaralla et al. (2007) reveal that it is in fact in outpatient settings wh ere more fatal adverse drug events (ADE) occur when these are compared to those occurring in hospitals (1 of 131 outpati ent deaths compared to 1 in 854 inpatient deaths). In the outpatient setting, adverse drug events (ADEs) occur 25% of the time and over one-third of these are considered preventable (Tache et al., 2011). Particularly vulnerable are patients over 65 years, with evidence suggesting that the rate of ADEs per 10,000 person per year increases with age; 25 -44 years old at 1.3; 45 -64 at 2.2, and 65 + at 3.8 (Sarkar et al., 2011). Another vulnerable group are chronically ill individuals. These population groups are more likely to experience ADEs and subsequent hospitalization. A multiplicity of providers and inadequate care coordination among them has been identified as barriers to collecting complet e and reliable medication records. Data indicate that reconciliati on and documentation continues to be poorly executed with discrepancies occurring in 92% (74 of 80 patients) of medication lists among admittance to the emergency room. Of 80 patients included in the study, the home medications were re ordered for 65% of p atients on their admission and of the 65% the majority (29%) had a change in their dosing interval, while 23% had a change in their route of administration, and 13% had a change in dose. A total of 361 medication discrepancies, or the difference between th e medications patients were taking before admission and those listed in there admission orders, were identified in at least 74 patients. (Peusschers et al., 2015; Poornima et al ., 2015) The study found that \"Through an appropriate reconciliation programme, around 80% of errors relating to medication and the potential harm caused by these errors could be reduced.\" (Peusschers et al., 2015; Poornima et al., 2015) Documentation of current medications in the medical record facilitates the process of medication review and reconciliation by the provider, which are necessary for reducing ADEs and promoting medication safety. The need for provider to provider coordination regarding medication records, and the existing gap in implementation, is highlighted in the Am erican Medical Association's (AMA) Physician's Role in Medication Reconciliation (2007), which states that \"critical patient information, in cluding medical and medication histories, current medications the patient is receiving and taking, and sources of me dications, is essential to the delivery of safe medical care. However, interruptions in the continuity of care and information gaps in pati ent health records are common and significantly affect patient outcomes\" (American Medical Association, 2007, p.7). T his is because clinical decisions based on information that is incomplete and/or inaccurate are likely to lead to medication error and ADEs. Weeks et al. (2010) noted similar barriers and identified the utilization of health information technology as an op portunity for facilitating the creation of universal medication lists. 47 One 2015 meta -analysis showed an association between EHR documentation with an overall RR of 0.46 (95% CI = 0.38 to 0.55; P < 0.001) and ADEs with an overall RR of 0.66 (95% CI = 0.44 to 0.99; P = 0.045). This meta -analysis provides evidence that the use of the EHR can improve the quality of healthcare delivered to patients by reducing medication errors and ADEs (Campanella et al., 2016). CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The Joint Commission's 2015 Ambulatory Care National Patient Safety Goals guide providers to maintain and communicate accurate patient medication information. Specifically, the section \"Use Medicines Safely NPSG.03.06.01\" states the following: \"Maintain and communic ate accurate patient medication information. The types of information that clinicians use to reconcile medications include (among others) medication name, dose, frequency, route, and purpose. Organizations should identify the information that needs to be c ollected to reconcile current and newly ordered medications and to safely prescribe medications in the future.\" (Joint Commission, 2015, retrieved at: http://www.jointcommission.org/assets/1/6/2015_NPSG_AHC1.PDF ). The National Quality Forum's 2010 update of the Safe Practices for Better Healthcare, states healthcare organizations must develop, reconcile, and communicate an accurate patient medication list throughout the continuum of care (p. 40).

NUMERATOR NOTE: In the event that a patient is screened for tobacco use and identi fied as a user but did not receive tobacco cessation intervention or if tobacco status is unknown, submit 4004F with 8P. This measure defines tobacco cessation counseling as lasting 3 minutes or less. Services typically provided under CPT codes 99406 and 99407 satisfy the requirement of tobacco cessation intervention, as these services provide tobacco cessation counseling for 3 -10 minutes. If a patient received these types of services, submit CPT II 4004F. Denominator Exception(s) are determined on the date of the most recent denominator eligible encounter for all submission criteria. Numerator Options: Performance Met : Patient screened for tobacco use AND received tobacco cessation intervention (counseling, pharmacotherapy, or both), if identified as a tobacco user (4004F) OR Performance Met: Current tobacco non -user (1036F) OR Denominator Exception: Documentation of medical reason(s) for not screening for tobacco use (e.g., limited life expectancy, other medical reason) (4004F with 1P) OR Denominator Exception : Documentation of medical reason(s) for not providing tobacco cess ation intervention if identified as a tobacco user (e.g., limited life expectancy, other medical reason) (G9909) OR Performance Not Met: Tobacco screening not performed OR tobacco cessation intervention not provided, reason not otherwise specified (4004F with 8P) RATIONALE: This measure is intended to promote adult tobacco screening and tobacco cessation interventions for those who use to bacco products. There is good evidence that tobacco screening and brief cessation intervention (including counseling and/or pharmacotherapy) is successful in helping tobacco users quit. Tobacco users who are able to stop using tobacco lower their ri sk for heart disease, lung disease, and stroke. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to adults who use tobacco. (Grade A Recommendation) (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2015) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant women about tobacco use, advise them to st op using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant women who use tobacco. (Grade A Recommendation) (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2015) 52 The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to recommend electr onic nicotine delivery systems for tobacco cessation in adults, including pregnant women. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians direct patients who smoke tobacco to other cessation interventions with established effectiveness and safety (previously stated) .

Two rates are reported. 1. Percentage of patients who were ordered at least one high -risk medication. 2. Percentage of patients who were ordered at least two of the same high -risk medication INSTRUCTIONS: This measure is to be submitted a minimum of once per performance period for patients seen during the performance period. There is no diagnosis associated with this measure. This measure may be submitted by eligible clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the services provided and the measu re-specific denominator coding. This measure will be calculated with 2 performance rates: 1. Percentage of patients who were ordered at least one high -risk medication 2. Percentage of patients who were ordered at least two of the same high -risk medication Eligible clinicians should continue to submit the measure as specified, with no additional steps needed to account for multiple performance rates . Measure Submission : The listed denominator criteria is used to identify the intended patient population. The num erator options included in this specification are used to submit the quality actions allowed by the measure. The quality -data codes listed do not need to be submitted for registry submissions; however, these codes may be submitted for those registries that utilize claims data. THERE ARE TWO SUBMISSION CRITERIA FOR THIS MEASURE: 1) Percentage of patients who were ordered at least one high -risk medication OR 2) Percentage of patients who were ordered at least two of the same high -risk medications SUBMISSION CRITERIA 1: PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS WHO WERE ORDERED AT LEAST ONE HIGH -RISK MEDICATION DENOMINATOR ( SUBMISSION CRITERIA 1): Patients 65 years and older who had a visit during the measurement period Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases) 1: Patients aged 65 years on date of encounter AND Patient encounter during performance period (CPT Patients who use hospice services any time during the measurement period : G9741 NUMERATOR (REPORTING CRITERIA 1): Percentage of patients who were ordered at least one high -risk medication during the measurement period Numerator Instructions: 54 INVERSE MEASURE - A lower calculated performance rate for this measure indicates better clinical care or control. The \"Performance Not Met\" numerator option for this measure is the representation of the better clinical quality or control. Subm itting that numerator option will produce a performance rate that trends closer to 0%, as quality in creases. For inverse measures a rate of 100% means all of the denominator eligible patients did not receive the appropriate care or were not in proper control. A high -risk medication is identified by either of the following: A prescription for medications classified as high risk at any dose and for any duration listed in Table 1 Prescriptions for medications classified as high risk at any dose with greater than a 90 day cumulative medication duration listed in Table 2 Definitions: The intent of Numerator 1 is to assess if the patient has been prescribed at least one high -risk medication. Cumulative Medication Duration - an individual's total number of medication days over a specific period; the period counts multiple prescriptions with gaps in between, but does not count the gaps during which a medication was not dispensed. To determine the cumulative medication duration, determine first the number of the Medication Days for each prescription in the period: the number of doses divided by the dose frequency per day. Then add the Medication Days for each prescription without counting any days between the prescriptions. Table 1 - High -Risk Medications at any dose or duration 55 Table 2 - High -Risk Medications With Days Supply Criteria NUMERATOR NOTE: NUMERATOR NOTE: Some high -risk medications are not included in this specific measure but should be avoided above a specified average daily dose. These medications are listed in Table 3. To calculate an average daily dose multiply the quantity of pills ordered by the dose of each pill and divide by the days supply. For example, a prescription for a 30 - days supply of digoxin containing 15 pills, 0.250 mg each pill, has an average daily dose of 1.125 mg. Table 3 - High -Risk Medications With Average Daily Dose Criteria 56 Numerator Options: Performance Met: One high -risk medication ordered (G9365) OR Performance Not Met: One high -risk medication not ordered (G9366) OR SUBMISSION CRITERIA 2: PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS WITH AT LEAST TWO ORDERS FOR THE SAME HIGH -RISK MEDICATION DENOMINATOR ( SUBMISSION CRITERIA 2): Patients 65 years and older who had a visit during the measurement period Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases) 2: Patients aged 65 years on date of encounter AND Patient encounter during performance period EXCLUSION : Patients who use hospice services any time during the measurement period: G9741 NUMERATOR ( SUBMISSION CRITERIA 2): Percentage of patients with at least two orders for the same high -risk medication - during the measurement period Numerator Instructions: INVERSE MEASURE - A lower calculated performance rate for this measure indicates better clinical care or control. The \"Performance Not Met\" numerator option for this measure is the representation of the better clinical quality or control. Submitting that numerator option will produce a performance rate that trends closer to 0%, as quality increases. For inverse measures a rate of 100% means all of the d enominator eligible patients did not receive the appropriate care or were not in proper control. A high -risk medication is identified by either of the following: A prescription for medications classified as high risk at any dose and for any duration liste d in Table 4 Prescriptions for medications classified as high risk at any dose with greater than a 90 day cumulative medication duration listed in Table 5 Definitions: The intent of Numerator 2 is to assess if the patient has either been prescribed at least two of the same high -risk medication in Table 4, received two or more prescriptions, where the sum of days supply exceeds 90 days, for medications in the same medic ation class in Table 5 The intent of the measure is to assess if the submitting provider ordered the high -risk medication(s). If the patient had a high -risk medication previously prescribed by another provider, they would not be counted towards the numer ator unless the submitting provider also ordered a high -risk medication for them. Cumulative Medication Duration - an individual's total number of medication days over a specific period; the period counts multiple prescriptions with gaps in between, but does not count the gaps during which a medication was not dispensed. To determine the cumulative medication du ration, determine first the number of the Medication Days for each prescription in the period: the number of doses divided by the dose frequency per day. Then add the Medication Days for each prescription without counting any days between the prescriptio ns. For example, there is an original prescription for 30 days with 2 refills for thirty days each. After a gap of 3 months, the medication was prescribed again for 60 days with 1 refill for 60 days. The cumulative medication duration is (30 x 3) + (60 x 2) = 210 days over the 10 month period. 57 Table 4 - High -Risk Medications at any dose or duration *The registry version of the measure specifications only indicate the classes of drugs that are considered high -risk and do not include the specific coding of RxNorm. However, this measure aligns with the eCQM measure (CMS 156) and providers may review the RxNorm codes in the applicable eCQM value sets for submission. 58 Table 5 - High -Risk Medications With Days Supply Criteria NUMERATOR NOTE: Some high -risk medications are not included in this specific measure but should be avoided above a specified average daily dose. These medications are listed in Table 6. To calculate an average daily dose multiply the quantity of pills ordered by the dose of each pill and divide by the days supply. For example, a prescription for a 30 -days sup ply of digoxin containing 15 pills, 0.250 mg each pill, has an average daily dose of 0.125mg. Table 6 - DAE -C: High -Risk Medications With Average Daily Dose Criteria Numerator Options: Performance Met: At least two orders for the same high -risk medication (G9367) OR Performance Not Met: At least two orders for the same high-risk medications not ordered (G9368) RATIONALE: Seniors receiving inappropriate medications are more likely to report poorer health status at follow -up, compared to seniors who receive appropriate medications (Fu, Liu, and Christensen 2004. A study of the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medicati on use in older adults found that 40 percent of individuals 65 and older filled at least one prescription for a potentially inappropriate medication and 13 percent filled two or more (Fick et al. 2008). While some adverse drug events are not preventable, s tudies estimate that between 30 and 80 percent of adverse drug events in the elderly are preventable (MacKinnon and Hepler 2003). Reducing the number of inappropriate prescriptions can lead to improved patient safety and significant cost savings. Conservative estimates of extra costs due to potentially inappropriate medications in the elderly average $7.2 billion a year (Fu et al. 2007). Medication use by older adults will likely increase further as the U.S. population ages, new drugs are developed , and new therapeutic and preventive uses for medications are discovered (Rothberg et al. 2008). The annual direct costs of preventable adverse drug events (ADEs) in the Medicare population have been estimated to exceed $800 million (IOM, 2007). By the yea r 2030, nearly one in five U.S. residents is expected to be aged 65 years or older; this age group is projected to more than double in number from 38.7 million in 2008 to more than 88.5 million in 2050. Likewise, the population aged 85 years or older is ex pected to increase almost four -fold, from 5.4 million to 19 million between 2008 and 2050. As the elderly population continues to grow, the number of older adults who present with multiple medical conditions for which several medications are prescribed con tinues to increase, resulting in polypharmacy (Gray and Gardner 2009). CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS : The measure is based on recommendations from the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Ad ults. The criteria were developed through key clinical expert consensus processes by Beers in 1997, 59 Zahn in 2001 and an updated process by Fick in 2003, 2012 and 2015. The Beers Criteria identifies lists of drugs that are potentially inappropriate for all older adults and drugs that are potentially inappropriate in the elderly based on various high -risk factors such as dosage, days' supply and underlying diseases or conditions. NCQA's Medication Management expert panel selected a subset of drugs that should be used with caution in the elderly for inclusion in the proposed measure based upon the recommendations in the Beers Criteria. Certain medications (MacKinnon 2003) are associated with increased risk of harm from drug side -effects and drug toxicity and pose a concern for patient safety. There is clinical consensus that these drugs pose increased risks in the elderly (Kaufman 2005). Studies link prescription drug use by the elderly with adverse drug events that contribute to hospitalization, increas ed length of hospital stay, increased duration of illness, nursing home placement and falls and fractures that are further associate d with physical, functional and social decline in the elderly (AHRQ 2009).

Most childhood vaccines are between 90 and 99 percent effective in preventing dise ases (HealthyChildren 2011). Immunization is a critical aspect of preventive care for children. Lack of proper immunization leads to an increase in illness, doctor visits and hospitalizations, all of which t ranslate into higher costs. (Tatzlandrew, Brown, and Halpern). Vaccination of each U.S. birth cohort with the current childhood immunization schedule prevents approximately 42,000 deaths and 20 million cases of disease, and saves nearly $14 billion in direct costs and $69 billion in societal costs each y ear (Zhou 2011; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2011b). Immunizing a child not only protects that child's health but also the health of the community, especially for those who are n ot immunized or are unable to be immunized due to other health complications (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2009). When the majority of the community is immunized against a disease, other members of the community are also protected because herd immunity shields them. (National Institute of Allergy and In fectious Diseases 2010). CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT: Summary of Recommendations for Child/Teen Immunization (Ages birth through 18 years) (Immunization Action Coalition) based on recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP, 2012) Hepatitis B (HepB) - Vaccinate all children age 0 through 18 years - Vaccinate all newborns with monovalent vaccine prior to hospital discharge. Give dose #2 at age 1 -2 months and the final dose at age 6 -18 months (the last dose in the infa nt series should not be given earlier than age 24 weeks). After the birth dose, the series may be completed using 2 doses of single -antigen vaccine or up to 3 doses of Comvax(r) (ages 2 months, 4 months 12 -15 months) or Pediatrix(r) (ages 2 months, 4 month s, 6 months), which may result in giving a total of 4 doses of hepatitis B vaccine. - If mother is HBsAg -positive: give the newborn HBIG + dose #1 within 12 hours of birth; complete series at age 6 months or, if using Comvax(r), at age 12 -15 months. - If mother is HBsAg status is unknown: given the newborn dose #1 within 12 hours of birth. If low birth weight (less than 2000 grams), also give HBIG within 12 hours.

Eligible clinicians who submit the measure must perform the blood pressure screening at the time of a qualifying visit and ma y not obtain measurements from external sources. This measure may be submitted by eligible clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the services provided and the measure -specific denominator coding. The intent of this measure is to screen patients for high blood press ure and provide recommended follow -up as indicated. Both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements are required for inclusion. If there are multiple blood pressures on the same date of service, use the most recent (last reading documented) as the representative blood pressure. The documented follow -up plan must be related to the current BP reading as indicated, example: \"Patient referred to primary care provider for BP management\". Measure Submission: The listed denominator criteria is used to identify the intended patient population. The numerator options included in this specification are used to submit the quality actions allowed by the measure. The quality -data codes listed do not need to be submitted for registry submissions; however, thes e codes may be submitted for those registries that utilize claims data. DENOMINATOR: All patients aged 18 years and older DENOMINATOR NOTE: *Signifies that this CPT Category I code is a non -covered service under the Medicare Part B Physician Fee Schedule (PFS). These non -covered services should be counted in the denominator population for registry -based measures. Denominator Criteria (El igible Cases): Patients aged 18 years AND Patient encounter during the performance period AND NOT DENOMINATOR EXCLUSION: *Patient not eligible due to active diagnosis of hype rtension: G9744 NUMERATOR: Patients who were screened for high blood pressure AND have a recommended follow -up plan documented, as indicated, if the blood pressure is pre -hypertensive or hypertensive NUMERATOR NOTE: Although the recommended screening interval for a normal BP reading is every 2 years, to meet the intent of this measure, BP screening and follow -up must be performed once per performance period. For patients with Normal blood pressure, a follow -up plan is not required. If the blood pressure is pre -hypertensive (SBP > 120 and 64 <139 OR DBP >80 and <89) at a Primary Care Provider (PCP) encounter follow up as directed by the PCP would meet the intent of the measu re (G8783) . Definitions: Blood Pressure (BP) Classification - BP is defined by four (4) BP reading classifications: Normal, Pre - Hypertensive, First Hypertensive, and Second Hypertensive Readings Recommended BP Follow -Up - The Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) recommends BP screening intervals, lifestyle modifications and interventions based on the current BP reading as listed in the \"Recommended Blood Pressure Follow - Up Interv entions\" listed below Recommended Lifestyle Modifications - The JNC 7 report outlines lifestyle modifications which must include one or more of the following as indicated: Weight Reduction Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Eating Plan Dietary Sodium Restriction Increased Physical Activity Moderation in alcohol (ETOH) Consumption Second Hypertensive Reading - Requires a BP reading of Systolic BP 140 mmHg OR Diastolic BP 90 mmHg during the current encounter AND a most recent BP read ing within the last 12 months Systolic BP 140 mmHg OR Diastolic BP 90 mmHg Second Hypertensive BP Reading Interventions - The JNC 7 report outlines BP follow -up interventions for a second hypertensive BP reading and must include one or more of the following as indicated: Anti-Hypertensive Pharmacologic Therapy Laboratory Tests Electrocardiogram (ECG) Recommended Blood Pressure Follow -up Interventions - Normal BP: No follow -up required for Systolic BP <120 Diastolic BP Follow -up with rescreen every year with systolic BP of 120 - 139 mmHg OR diastolic BP of 80 - 89 mmHg AND recommended lifestyle modifications OR referral to Alternate/Primary Care Provider First Hypertensive BP Reading: Patients with one elevated reading of systolic BP >= 140 mmHg OR diastolic BP >= 90 mmHg: o Follow -up with rescreen > 1 day and < 4 weeks AND recommend lifestyle modifications OR referral to Alternative/Primary Care Provider Second Hypertensive BP Reading: Patients with second elevat ed reading of systolic BP >= 140 mmHg OR diastolic BP >= 90 mmHg: o Follow -up with Recommended lifestyle modifications AND one or more of the Second Hypertensive Reading Interventions OR referral to Alternative/Primary Care Provider 65 Recommended Blood Pressure Follow -Up Table *Not Eligible for High Blood Pressure Screening (Denominator Exclusion) - Patient has an active diagnosis of hypertension starts prior to the current encounter **Patients with a Documented Reason for not Sc reening or Follow -Up Plan for High Blood Pressure (Denominator Exception) - Patient refuses to participate (either BP measurement or follow -up) Patient is in an urgent or emergent situation where time is of the essence and to delay treatment would jeopar dize the patient's health status. This may include but is not limited to severely elevated BP when immediate medical treatment is indicate d Numerator Options: Performance Met Normal blood pressure reading documented, follow -up not required (G8783) OR Performance Met : Pre-Hypertensive or Hypertensive blood pressure reading documented, AND the indicated follow -up is documented (G8950) OR Denominator Exception: **Documented reason for not screening or recommending a follow -up for high blood pressure (G9745) OR Performance Not Met: Blood pressure reading not documented, reason not given (G8785) 66 OR Performance Not Met: Pre-Hypertensive or Hypertensive blood pressure reading documented, indicated follow -up not documented, reason not given (G8952) RATIONALE: Hypertension is a prevalent condition that affects approximately 66.9 million people in the United States. It is estimated th at about 20 -40% of the adult population has hypertension; the majority of people over age 65 have a hypertension diagnosis (Appleto n SL, et. al., 2012 and Luehr D, et. al., 2012). Winter (2013) noted that 1 in 3 American adults have hypertension and the lifetime risk of developing hypertension is 90% (Winter KH, et. al., 2013). The African American population or non -Hispanic Blacks, t he elderly, diabetics and those with chronic kidney disease are at increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and renal disease. Non -Hispanic Blacks have the highest prevalence at 38.6% (Winter KH, et. al., 2013). Hypertension is a major risk factor f or ischemic heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, renal failure, stroke and dementia (Luehr D, et. al., 2012). Hypertension is the most common reason for adult office visits other than pregnancy. Garrison (2013) stated that in 2007, 42 million amb ulatory visits were attributed to hypertension (Garrison GM and Oberhelman S, 2013). It also has the highest utilization of prescription drugs. Numerous resources and treatment options are available, yet only about 40 -50% of the hypertensive patients have their blood pressure under control (<140/90) (Appleton SL, et. al., 2012, Luehr D, et. al., 2012). In addition to medication non -compliance, poor outcomes are also attributed to poor adherence to lifestyle changes such as a low - sodium diet, weight loss, in creased exercise and limiting alcohol intake. Many adults find it difficult to continue medications and lifestyle changes when they are asymptomatic. Symptoms of elevated blood pressure usually do not occur until secondary problems arise such as with vascu lar diseases (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and renal insufficiency) (Luehr D, et. al., 2012). Appropriate follow -up after blood pressure measurement is a pivotal component in preventing the progression of hypertension and the development of heart disease. Detection of marginally or fully elevated blood pressure by a specialty clinician warrants referral to a provider familiar with the management of hypertension and prehypertension. The 2010 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Assessment of Cardiovasc ular Risk in Asymptomatic Adults continues to support using a global risk score such as the Framingham Risk Score, to assess risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in all asymptomatic adults (Greenland P, et. al., 2010) . Lifestyle modifications have demonstr ated effectiveness in lowering blood pressure (JNC 7, 2003). The synergistic effect of several lifestyle modifications results in greater benefits than a single modification alone. Baseline diagnostic/laboratory testing establishes if a co -existing underly ing condition is the etiology of hypertension and evaluates if end organ damage from hypertension has already occurred. Landmark trials such as ALLHAT have repeatedly proven the efficacy of pharmacologic therapy to control blood pressure and reduce the com plications of hypertension. Follow -up intervals based on blood pressure control have been established by the JNC 7 and the USPSTF. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for high blood pre ssure in adults age 18 years and older. This is a grade A recommendation.

In a study of physician satisfaction with the outpatient referral process, Gandhi et al. (2000) found that 68% of spec ialists reported receiving no information from the primary care provider prior to referral visits, and 25% of primary care provide rs had still not received any information from specialists 4 weeks after referral visits. In another study of 963 referrals (Forrest , 2000), pediatricians scheduled appointments with specialists for only 39% and sent patient information to the specialists in only 51% of the time. In a 2006 report to Congress, MedPAC found that care coordination programs improved quality of care for patients, reduced hospitalizations, and improved adherence to evidence -based care guidelines, especially among patients with diabetes and CHD. Associations with cost -savings were less clear; this was attributed to how well the intervention group was chosen and defined, as well as the intervention put in place. Additionally, cost -savings were usually calculated in the short -term, while some argue that the greatest cost -savings accrue over time (MedPAC, 2006). Improved mechanisms for information exchange could facilitate communication between providers, whether for time -limited referrals or consultations, on -going co -management, or during care transitions. For example, a study by Branger et al. (1999) found that an electronic communication network that linked the computer -based patient records of physicians who had shared care of patients with diabetes significantly increased freq uency of communications between physicians and availability of important clinical data. There was a 3 -fold increase in the likelihood that the specialist provided written communication of results if the primary care physician scheduled appointments and sen t patient information to the specialist (Forrest, 2000). Care coordination is a focal point in the current health care reform and our nation's ambulatory health information technolog y (HIT) framework. The National Priorities Partnership recently highlight ed care coordination as one of the most critical areas for development of quality measurement and improvement (NPP, 2008).

Numerator Options: Performance Met: Patient documented as tobacco user AND received tobacco cessation intervention ( must include at least one of the following: advice given to quit smoking or tobacco use, counseling on the benefits of quitting smoking or tobacco use, assistance with or referral to external smoking or tobacco cessation support programs, or current enrollment in smoking or tobacco use cessation program) if identified as a tobacco user (G9458) OR Performance Met: Currently a tobacco non -user (G9459) OR Performance Not Met: Tobacco assessment OR tobacco cessation intervention not performed, reason not given (G9460) 70 RATIONALE: This measure is intended to promote adolescent tobacco screening and tobacco cessation interventions for those who use tobacco products. There is good evidence that tobacco screening and brief cessation intervention (including counseling and/or pharmacotherapy) is successful in helping tobacco users quit. Tobacco users who are able to stop smoking lower their risk for heart diseas e, lung disease, and stroke. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that primary care clinicians provide inte rventions, including education or brief counseling, to prevent initiation of tobacco use in school -aged children and adolescents. (Strength of Recommendation = B) (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2013) All patients should be asked if they use tobacc o and should have their tobacco use status documented on a regular basis. Evidence has shown that clinic screening systems, such as expanding the vital signs to include tobacco use status or the use of other reminder systems such as chart stickers or compu ter prompts, significantly increase rates of clinician intervention. (Strength of Evidence = A) (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Public Health Service, 2008) All physicians should strongly advise every patient who smokes to quit because evi dence shows that physician advice to quit smoking increases abstinence rates. (Strength of Evidence = A) (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Public Health Service, 2008) Minimal interventions lasting less than 3 minutes increase overall tobacc o abstinence rates. Every tobacco user should be offered at least a minimal intervention, whether or not he or she is referred to an intensive intervention. (Strength of Evid ence = A) (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Public Health Service, 20 08) The combination of counseling and medication is more effective for smoking cessation than either medication or counseling alone. Therefore, whenever feasible and appropriate, both counseling and medication should be provided to patients trying to quit smoking.

Custom codes are codes created for the purposes of addressing required measure criteria that are not codified. They are no different than ICD10, CPT, HCPCS, CPT2, or other standardized codes, except that they are unique to the specific measure in which they are used. All custom codes will use the value \" CPT\" for the coding system. Custom codes are used in three ways: 1) Additional Criteria - To verify the presence of a non -codified condition that is req uired for measure denominator/numerator eligibility. 2) Denominator Exclusion - To identify a non -codified condition that excludes a patient or encounter from the measure denominator. 3) Numerator Attestation - To attest to the performance of a non -codif ied quality clinical action that meets the numerator or performance -exception requirements. The 2022 AAAAI QCDR has measures that demonstrate condition codes as Additional Criteria and Numerator Attestation. There are no measures that use condition codes for Denominator Exclusion. Example of an Additional Criteria Code AAAAI Custom Measure #8: Achievement of Projected Effective Dose of Standardized Allergens for Patient Treated with Allergen Immunotherapy for at Least One Year features an example a custom code that is required for denominator eligibility. In the measure specification there is a condition that is not codified: 73 When completing the upload template, a custom code (AAAAI_8.DEN.1.YES) will be entered to attest that the non-codified criteria is documented in the medical record. If the code is not sent, th e patient will not be eligible for AAAAI Custom Measure #8. Using the Upload Template* *NOTE: This document uses examples of a portion of the upload template for purposes of custom code demonstration. Please use the full te mplate available in the 'Resources' section of the QCDR application . Example of Numerator Attestation Codes AAAAI Custom Measure # 6: Documentation of Clinical Response to Allergen Immunotherapy within One Year features an example of custom codes that are used to report the patient as 'numerator -met' or 'numerator not - met' for the measure. Sending the custom c odes will attest that the patient was either assessed and documented for clinical improvement and efficacy at least one within 12 months of initiating allergen immunotherapy or not assessed and/or not documented for clinical improvement and efficacy at least one within 12 months of initiating ounter Custom code indicating standardized extract 74 Below are examples of upload templates demonstrating how to use the custom code to meet or not meet the numerator.
