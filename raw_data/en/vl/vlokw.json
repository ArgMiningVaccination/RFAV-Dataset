The decision to reopen state borders comes as the nation reaches the 90 per cent mark of its fully-vaccinated adult population. While EMCO (enhanced movement control order) areas will still remain closed off to travellers, Malaysians will finally be able to embark on interstate journeys for non-work purposes, no longer requiring police permits. Though it is not compulsory, the prime minister encouraged travellers to take a Covid-19 self-test before leaving the state. Children below the age of 18 years may also travel with their fully-vaccinated parents across state lines, adhering to face mask requirements, social distancing and other health SOPs. Travellers bound for Sarawak are required to apply for entry via the [EnterSarawak](https://entersarawak.socoe.co/register) website, offering proof of their complete Covid-19 vaccination along with a negative RT-PCR test or an antigen rapid test kit (no older than three days). Sabah too, has announced its decision to reopen its borders for interstate travel from November 1 onwards to fully vaccinated adults and teens aged between 12 to 18 years old who have completed at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccination. Children under 12 years old must be accompanied by a fully vaccinated adult.

We have shortened the quarantine period for fully vaccinated travelers returning/coming to Malaysia from 14 days to seven days. Close contact isolation for fully vaccinated people is also cut from 10 days to seven days.\u2014 Khairy Jamaluddin (@Khairykj) [#ReopeningSafely] [October 15, 2021] To encourage Malaysians everywhere to exercise every precaution when travelling, health minister Khairy Jamaluddin advised Malaysians to observe SOPs, wear face masks wherever necessary and practise TRISS (Test, Report, Isolate, Inform, Seek).
