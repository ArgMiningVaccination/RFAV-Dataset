Amazingly, the US healthcare industryspends $1.6 trillion annually, and yet, we rank 12th outof 13 industrialized countries in 16 major indicators.Americans spend more than $5000 per person eachyear and are 27th in life expectancy; Cuba, at 28th,spends $186. 1Dissatisfaction with the American healthcare system, as well as interest prompted byEastern philosophies and ancient healing practicesreintroduced into Western culture, has brought aboutthe key paradigm shift toward holistic medicine in theUnited States.

Market St, York, PA 17403 (sd372@drexel.edu).Ironically, a contributing factor is medical progress itself: As people live longer, they develop manystress-related diseases, such as heart disease, stroke,diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and cancer. Stress in ourlives tends to be viewed as a detriment, but in actualityit really implies any necessary adaptation, even oneregarded as benecial. It can, however, lead to\"distress,\" as repetitive or overt demands cause acascade of sympathetic nervous system responses. 2In 1926, Hans Selye was one of the rst scientists toconsider the harmful physiologic response to stressand distress on health, theorizing potentially harmfuleffects on one's ability to handle and adjust to thedemands of injury and disease. 3The deleterious impact of stress continues to influence, and today, ithas become widespread. In fact, as many as 90% ofvisits to primary care providers are for stress-relatedsymptoms. 4Work-related stress, the leading source of stress for adults, appears to be increasinglyproblematic. Swedish and American researchers reporta 500% increase in colorectal cancer for those withjob-related stressors that span a 10-year period, notingthat occupational issues, intrinsically more chronic innature, demonstrate a greater long-term effect than amore dramatic emotional occurrence, such as death ofa spouse or child. 5Researchers, considering animal 315316 HOLISTIC NURSING PRACTICE NOVEMBER /DECEMBER 2009 responses potentially applicable to humans, have demonstrated the effects of both acute and chronicstress on natural killer cell activity. These specializedcells eliminate foreign invaders, such as viruses andspontaneous malignant cells, and become suppressedwith prolonged exposure to a stressful environment,thus likely predisposing to neoplastic disease. 6,7 Further, animal models have shown the effect of stresson DNA repair mechanisms, with malignantlytransformed cells appearing to become active tumors. 7 The effects of acute and chronic stress on immunity, healing, and the emotional response continue to beevaluated. Many authors 5,7-9theorize that stress is an outcome of our traditional cultural repression ofpowerful emotions, such as anger, fear, loneliness, andgrief, becoming depression, weakening our immunesystem, and ultimately leading to chronic disease.Researchers also note that stresses in humans can beinfluenced by perception, that is, those whopsychologically sense their own capability to controlappear to tolerate their situation better than those withoverwhelming demands coupled with helplessness. 6,10 The underlying assumption that a decline in health and quality of life from distress leading to chronicdisease is inevitable and natural\u2014an irreconcilablemanifestation of genetic legacy and aging\u2014is notinevitable or natural at all. Many of the basic causes ofthis decline can usually be understood, prevented,treated, and even reversed by controlling the influenceof stress in our lives. Consumer enthusiasm for the useof ancient stress-reduction techniques in combinationwith conventional care continues to grow. Today, 63million adults report using relaxation techniques, suchas meditation, guided imagery, and energy healing,reflecting a 5% increase from 1990 to 2007. 11-14In fact, these methods of controlling stress are the mostfrequently utilized integrative therapies used to treatchronic diseases, the cure of which, for many, iselusive. 13,15 It is becoming clearer that most of the health and quality-of-life issues we are likely to witness duringour lives can be prevented with greater attention to thecombination of modern science with the wisdom ofancient healing. For patients living with chronic orlife-threatening illness, as well as those who simplywish to increase self-awareness, enhance theirwell-being, and help prevent future health-relatedproblems, these types of approaches can profoundlytransform the physical, emotional, and spiritualdimensions of their lives. 16Cultivating emotional and spiritual health through these interventional techniquesand dealing with the sense of disconnection and loss of meaning and purpose that seems to be so commonin our modern society, we can change thecircumstances contributing to poor health and set freeour full potential for good health and healing. THE TOPIC OF ENERGY THERAPIES The topic of energy therapies is prompted by theincreasing interest of healthcare practitioners as wellas consumers. The purpose of this article is to rstallow for a review of the principles of classic physicsthat provide the foundation for quantum interpretationof energetic phenomena, along with the exploration ofsome theoretical concepts involving the body'spotential for dynamic interrelationships. The secondsegment provides an overview of the contemplativetradition of meditation, outlining its importance as arequisite element in the practice of energy therapies.The relevance of energy therapies as a path toself-transcendence along with the application of aspecic touch technique, Zero Balancing (ZB), ishighlighted. The rationale of a manuscript devoted to2 separate topics serves to underscore the necessitythat the practice of energy therapies combines aknowledge base of the core scientic precepts with theexperience of restorative strategies. This relationshipbetween the contemplative traditions and the practiceof energy therapies can be understood by consideringthe underlying principles of energy elds, with theidea of conscious reality as the underpinning ofphysical reality. Didactic and experiential education inenergy therapies, as well as the continuation of atransformative, centering practice, clearly emphasizesthat treatment of the patient/client actually begins withour own self-transcendence and restorative strategies. BACKGROUND The \"innovative\" theory that the mind, body, and spiritare all essential components in the healing process hasancient beginnings in the teachings of Hippocrates (ca.400 BC). Hippocrates wrote of the integrativeapproach to healing and considered the patient'sattitudes and beliefs as crucial contributions totreatment outcome. 3This philosophy continued in the East. Conversely, \"progress\" in the West by the 17thcentury led to the Cartesian conceptual boundarybetween the mind and the body. New discoveries suchas antibiotics, thought to have eradicated infectiousThe Science of Energy Therapies 317 epidemics by the 18th century, appeared to reiterated man's domination over nature.8However, historians note that improved sanitation conditions andnutritional status likely provided the greater impact. 17 Healing continued to became compartmentalized, withthe goal, healing of the physical body, and irrespectiveof the soul. As the division between the mind andbody expanded, scientists developed concretebiological theories, thus reinforcing the prevailingopinion that emotion and subconscious perceptionwere diseases of the mind and therefore did not exist. 3 Many today look to the East and consider our currentWestern-based philosophy as dismissive andnonprogressive. \"If Western medicine is to have atruly cohesive physiological system, it mustincorporate a unied theory that can account for theexistence of energy elds within as well as outside ofthe human body.\" 9(pIII) ENERGY MEDICINE: THE DEFINITIONS The National Center for Complementary andAlternative Medicine has classied energy medicinetherapies into 2 basic categories: the veritable or bioelectromagnetic-based therapies, and putative energy eld (also called \"bioelds\") therapies. 18The veritable energies employ mechanical vibrations and forces, that is, sound, light, and magnetism\u2014all withmeasurable wavelengths and frequencies. The earliestknown use of an electromagnetic therapy wasrecorded in 2750 BC, when one's illness was treated by exposure to the shocks from electric eels.19Diagnostic evaluations such the electrocardiogram andelectroencephalogram (EEG), while easily accepted intoday's medicine as conventional, are basically energymedicine as they measure the electromagneticfrequencies (EMFs) of the heart and brain. Radiationhas long been considered standard for the treatment ofcertain cancers, with today's successful application ofthe newest technologies. Utilizing proton beams to hitthe tumor and stop (in contrast with traditionalradiation therapy in which radiation passes throughthe body and leaves a trail of damage) allows forhigher doses, better control, and fewer side effects.Stereotactic radiosurgery of CyberKnife and GammaKnife use high-dose x-ray or laser beams to treattumors without making an actual incision. Otherdevelopments in the realm of energy therapeuticsinclude microcurrrent stimulators as well as numerousapplications of ultrasound technology, including saferTABLE 1.

Bonegrowth stimulators utilize pulsing electromagneticelds, the oscillation stimulating the healing process,with the most widely used application accelerating therepair of fracture \"nonunions.\" 20The Food and Drug Administration has just approved the rst noninvasivebrain stimulator, the transcranial magnetic stimulator,to treat depression. This device beams short pulses ofmagnetic energy through the skull, focusing at thelimbic system structures and causing neuronal activity.The transcranial magnetic stimulator was developedfrom use as a research tool in brain studies. TheNational Institutes of Health is currently tracking 260patients, evaluating safety and efcacy. 21 Theputative energy therapies recognize the body's vibrational energetic dimension as the vital movingforce, the source of health and well-being. Manycultures over thousands of years have described thisanimating energetic consciousness. TraditionalChinese Medicine calls it ' Qi' (or \" Chi\"), the Ayurvedic Medicine of India refers to ' prana ,' the Japanese describe ' ki', and, early last century, Europeans named it ' vital force .' 18,22Sensitive physical and biologic detection technologies such asthe superconducting quantum interference device(SQUID) are beginning to reliably measure thisputative eld, demonstrating the very properties that ancient civilization used, that perceptive individualsidentied, and that contemporary science considersnonexistent. 20,23-25 Energy therapies (Table 1) involve the putative energy elds can include a wide variety of modalitiessuch as acupuncture, homeopathy, and aromatherapy,as well as the use of magnets, sound, and herbs. Othertechniques include touch, nontouch and nonlocal/distance methods such as Reiki, Zero Balancing,Craniosacral therapy, Process Acupressure,Therapeutic Touch, and Healing Touch. Some318 HOLISTIC NURSING PRACTICE NOVEMBER /DECEMBER 2009 interventions use time-honored postures and movements, such as Yoga, Tai Chi, and Qi Gong, tobring about balance and harmony to the energy elds.All of these practices effectively guide life's energeticpatterns by directing the putative energy of the body to influence health. 26 CONCEPTS OF ENERGETIC REGULATION OF LIVING SYSTEMS Principles of classic physics Two fundamental electromagnetic principles of classic physics provide the basis of understanding theenergetic phenomena. The rst is Amp `ere Law (Laplace's Law) , which states that the magnetic eld is proportional to the current and inverselyproportional to the distance traveled by the current. 27 The important medical application of Amp` ere Law is essentially that any current within an organism mustgenerate a magnetic eld within and around the body.These currents can be any of the electrical oscillationscreated by the body, such as heartbeat and brainimpulses, or produced in the surrounding environmentand can move freely in and out of the body,unobstructed by skin. 23 The second law of electromagnetism speaks to the energy eld concept, and originated with Faraday'sLaw of Induction . Faraday, in 1831, knowing that electricity could produce magnetism, experimentedwith magnetism and attempted to create electricity. Hewas successful, producing a measurable electricalcurrent through a coil of wire while applying a movingmagnet. 27There are 2 key points of this law to understand. First, simply placing the magnet inproximity to the coil of wire was ineffective. Themagnet had to be in motion relative to the coil. Also,by increasing the number of coils, Faraday effectivelydiminished the magnetic eld strength and induced aproportional increase in current. Change, therefore, ineither movement or strength, becomes critical. Second,as the electrical current flows, it creates a magneticline of force that fans out in a perpendicular pattern tothe line of current, with strength proportional to thecurrent and inversely proportional to the distance. 27 The resulting electromagnetic eld continues travelingindenitely and concentrically at the speed of light,analogous to a pebble dropped in a pond. The path ofthis outward flow is additive as it interacts withmultiple concentric elds, becomingan oscillating force eld . 9The application of Faraday's Law in the case of livingsystems requires moving or oscillating force elds to induce current flows within and throughout theconducting tissue planes. 23Another consequence with signicant therapeutic influence is that changing themotion or timing of the magnetic elds in the spacearound the body will also induce current flows withinthe body. As a result, Faraday's Law provides thephysical basis for both energy-based therapeuticdevices and touch and nontouch energy modalities. 20 These electromagnetic oscillating elds continue to travel outward, forming additional interacting waves.When 2 waves are of the same frequency, that is, thenumber of times per second they move through acomplete cycle of oscillation is equal, they are in phase (the \"crest\" of the waves are in synchrony). They entrain by adding together to create larger, morecoherent waves, known as constructive interference . Waves that \"trough\" (crest in opposition) areconsidered out of phase , cancel each other, and are known as destructive interference . This addition and cancellation of waves is the interference pattern . Where the wave is weak, that is, a lack of wavinessdue to destructive interference, the amplitude is low.Where the waves have undergone additive constructiveinterference, the amplitude is high. The potential energy and information contained on the originalwaves is additive, retained, and not destroyed, with theinterference patterns causing variations in wavecoherency. The resulting waves are dynamic,becoming a complex total mix of resonant frequenciesand phases, interference patterns, and fluctuatingstates of coherent and incoherent variations. 28The ensuing electrical eld of the body may be perceivedas very complicated waves of quantum bioinformationmoving throughout the integrative structures, such asions, molecules, cellular processes, and tissues, andcombining to become an organized vibrationalnetwork of meaningful communication. 24,29,30 Oscillating elds of particulate matter are fundamental to all therapeutic interactions, whether involvingacoustics, sensation, pressure, temperature variations,herbs, light, aromas, or motion\u2014all incorporate someconguration of informational vibration. 19 Core of quantum interpretation Vibrational duality of the particle and the wave To understand this paradigm shift, we need to reconsider our Newtonian reductionist science, basedon single cause-and-effect relationships, and apply theprinciples relevant to the realm of quantum physics. 20 Einstein proved by E=mc2that energy and massThe Science of Energy Therapies 319 (matter) are dual expressions of the same substance, that of energy, the full spectrum of vibratingmolecules, of which we all are composed. Theassertion that all matter is energy provides the basicpremise for the endless changing and evolving ofliving systems. With the advent of Einstein's theory oflight, it became necessary for physicists to develop aprinciple of complementarity (contradictory properties) to explain light (energy/photon) exhibitingthe seemingly paradoxical elements of both particleand wave, concurrently. 29,31The application of complementarity to energy elds quantized energy into discrete bundles, with the size (and momentum)dependent on vibrational frequency. These discretebundles, photons , are particle-like wave packets of light energy, consisting of multiple frequencies, andwithout a well-dened wavelength. Photons can eitherbe in continuous undulation with weaker (lowamplitude) wave interference, the energy spreadingexpansively. Or, the photons can be insignicantexcept at a strong oscillation (high amplitude) waveformation within a limited area. The photon is lightenergy; so, as long as light is not detected, it willperform as a wave with interference patterning.However, when the circumstance involves light, theindividual photons can be located. In the presence oflight, the photon is distributed in discrete wavepackets, not spread out continuously, and thereforeessentially acting like a particle. The relationshipbetween the particle and the wave is purely statisticaland based on wave amplitude. The more likelyprobability of locating a photon will be where thewave has a strong oscillation (high amplitude). 31,32 Quantum duality acknowledges that the photon attainssome of the traits of particulate solids or mass whilemaintaining its energy (wave) characteristics. 26,30 Since our physical body is composed of matter, it hasboth the particle (biomolecular structures) and thewave (vibrational energy elds of information)components. 26Newton's physics depends on the experimental data to dictate which descriptive model,the particle or wave, provides the better explanation.However, to move forward with the quantumschematic, we need to conceptualize the vibrationalparticle-wave duality as discrete packets of energeticinformation and as fundamental to the explanation oflife. 29 The uncertainty principle and collapseof the wave function Quantization establishes a fundamental minimum amount of energy for any interaction. Newton'sphysics allows for the energy of the universe to be zero. Therefore, we could measure any position andmomentum of a system with an accurate prediction.However, quantum physics tells us that the energy ofthe universe cannot be zero. 32There exists a basic inaccuracy related to the wave-particle duality,causing our inability to simultaneously measure bothmomentum and position. Applying light (even a verylow-energy photon) to the electron(s) of the system tomeasure momentum or position automatically changesthe outcome by disturbing available informationregarding the system prior to impact, and thereforeending any capacity to predict future behavior. TheHeisenberg uncertainty principle acknowledges this dilemma of wave-particle duality, and recognizes thatwe clearly cannot examine the universe withoutinevitable change. By merely observing the world, weunalterably change it. No longer objective anddisconnected observers, our presence influences theoutcome of the experiment. 32 A good example of the uncertainty principle would be 2 waves, existing concurrently and in the samelocation, forming a superposition, which is additive toeither constructive or destructive interference. Thisinterference phenomenon, a combination of 2potential wave solutions, is a possibility secondary tothe wave characteristics of matter and light in quantumphysics. But, to measure a quantity, that is, to estimatethe probability of the photon location, the system hasto be forced into 1 denite state, causing the loss ofthe wave behavior. This is referred to as the collapse of wave function and forces the indeterminate wave function into one where we can identify the exactlocation of the photon. Quantum physics gives us aspecic value of this measurement, but, in the process,the system's properties are lost, invariably resultingfrom the observer's interaction to achieve theobservation. Quantization, the fact that the energy ofthe universe cannot be reduced to zero, greatly restrictsour capability to observe nature at the atomic level; theimplication being that just the act of observationunavoidably disturbs the observed system. 32 The universe as a whole In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen took 2 particles and proposed a hypothetical experiment (theEPR paradox), in which the spin dimensions of oneparticle automatically establishes the spin dimensionsof the other particle. 32Their premise was that neither of the particles' spins had an actual value until theleft-hand spin was determined; and then,instantaneously, the right-hand spin attained its value,320 HOLISTIC NURSING PRACTICE NOVEMBER /DECEMBER 2009 regardless of proximity. In 1964, Bell's nonlocality theorem mathematically conrmed this remotedistance relationship. 32,33Actual experiments have been conducted with increasing sophistication sincethen, conrming these hypothetical results. In fact, asuccessful repetition of this experiment was conductedwith the particles separated by the distance acrossZurich, Switzerland. Newton's mechanistic approachrequired all elements to be separate and independent.However, Bohm 31proposed that if all actions are energetic, the interactions between the systemscomprise a structure of inseparable nonlocal relationships, interconnecting the entire universe as awhole, therefore interactive, innitely andfundamentally linked. He further postulated thatwithin this structure, each abstract thought (in theform of discrete wave packets) demonstrates thefundamental properties, wave or particle, and theirrelationship to that of the general environment,drawing a distinct parallel to that of living beings andtheir organs versus the interworking of mechanicalmachinery. According to Bohm, 31these interactions, by necessity, would have to be transported at a speedfaster than that of light (186 000 miles per second).Our conventional perception of the physical worldexists at the speed of light. 9However, the quantum tenet of nonlocality is that information transfer is independent of time and space and potentially beyondour 3-dimensional (3-D) experience. 9,24,31,33Some have intimated that nonlocality phenomena be considered as a possible explanation for the efcacy ofmodalities involving distance healing effects, such asprayer and Reiki. 19,26,34 Biological self-organization Faraday's concept, as applied to the bioenergy eld, is understood by many24,29,33,35as the internal self-organizing capacity of the organism. Prigogine, aNobel laureate in chemistry for his contribution tononequilibrium thermodynamics, and Jantsch 29,33 support this application and consider living organismscapable of maintaining a dynamic energy-drivenrelationship with their environment, exchangingenergy, matter, and information to grow, sustain, andrenew themselves. A variety of scientists have appliedthis model to humans, determining that the complexdynamics of self-organization does not arise bychance, but, in fact, increases the body's inherentorder via the continuous flow of matter, energy, andinformation and is central to life's process ofself-repair and regeneration. 20,24,29,36A conceptualframework for the innate communicational aspect biological self-organization is that of a 3-D hologram.The hologram is a laser photograph of the interferencepattern of light waves reflecting from an object. It hasa unique characteristic ability to convey the complete3-D picture in each piece of the original photo, nomatter the size. Even small fragments can retain thewhole of recorded information of the entireholographic image. This suggests a model of holisticdistribution of biographical information; each cellcontaining a template of coded informationprogrammed for future repair and renewal andpossibly the key to the body's global integration andself-organization. 24,29,31,37,38 THEORETICAL CONCEPTS OF ENERGETIC RELATIONSHIPS If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it? \u2014Albert Einstein Expanding our notion to consider the complexity of body communication as multilayered transfer ofinformation by a miniscule energy signal has propelledscience to evaluate beyond current mechanical/neural(central and autonomic nervous systems/perineuralsystem) and chemical (peptides/neurotransmitters)regulatory network models. Thus, information can beregarded as a unifying mechanism, impacting theorganization of living systems, includingmechanical/neural, biochemical,bioelectrical/vibration, and emotional stimuli. Theseadditional models of communication are not limited bythe physical structure, and therefore, have the potentialto influence the body's overall regulatory processes. Connective Tissue/ Living Matrix Langevin39has hypothesized the potential for connective tissue to be an energetic signaling network,on the basis of prior studies documenting therelationship between acupuncture points andmeridians with the connective tissue planes. 40She suggests that the 2000-year-old Traditional ChineseMedicine philosophy of the meridian network andpractice of acupuncture reflects this same theory. 39 The premise of a connective tissue \" living matrix \" model has not been regarded by Western medicine as abodywide communication system. In support of theliving matrix model, Oschman 20points out that theThe Science of Energy Therapies 321 interstitial connective tissue constitutes a flexible and responsive network affecting the overall bodystructure. The circulatory, nervous, respiratory,musculoskeletal, and digestive systems, as well as allthe organs, are surrounded and permeated by thiscontinuous weblike structural system. Oschman 20 purports the importance of expanding this concept,emphasizing that all body movements are produced bythe tensions within this interconnected tissue. Notableand common to both within and surrounding the cellsand nuclei is an organized crystalline layer of water,possibly functioning as the site of this rapidcommunicational network. 37In fact, Nobel Prize-recipient Szent-Gy\u00a8 orgyi asserted, \"Molecules do not have to touch each other to interact. Energy canflow through ...the electromagnetic eld ...The electromagnetic eld, along with water, forms thematrix of life. Water ...can form structures that transmit energy.\" 19(p60) A property of this crystalline water composition of connective tissue is piezoelectricity \u2014from Greek, meaning \"pressure electricity.\"20Because of piezoelectricity, all component movements, that is,muscle, bone, and nerves, along with a subsequentcorresponding vibration, produce a rapid response,generating the rhythmic coherences of bioelectricoscillations and microcurrents, and has been describedby many. 20,41For example, vibration produced by acoustical systems such as the heart, respirations, andmuscles transmits piezoelectric signals proliferatingthroughout the living matrix . These signals are precise, reversible, and, due to the interconnection andconductive ability of connective tissue, ultimately ableto communicate to every cell, thus affecting the body'soverall energy elds. 20In fact, piezoelectric effect on tissues responsible for the regulation of bone andtendon regrowth, a result of the research by Beckerand Selden 42and Bassett,43has provided the biological basis fracture nonunions and postoperativewounds. Pienta and Coffey 44have further theorized that vibrational information is transferred throughout theliving matrix via a tissue tensegrity-matrix model.Tensegrity , adapted from tensional int egrity, was coined as an architectural denition for a structuralsystem that gains stability from continuous tensioncables. The human body has been described as atensegrity design, with compression components, thebones, held together by tension cables, the muscles,tendons, and ligaments and supporting the continuousfluctuation of shape and movement. The principle of tensegrity has also been applied to the dynamicswithin the cell structure, allowing for the relay ofinformation via vibrational energy through wavemotion directly to the nucleus, as a cell signalingprocess. 44This theory provides the structural entity for a sophisticated and highly interactive communicativesignaling system\u2014that of the acupuncturists' meridiannetwork\u2014and capable of transmitting throughout aliving matrix of tissue. 40 Resonant Wave Entrainment Brainwave oscillation innervates the brain and perineural systems by generating direct eld currentsthroughout the body. 19,20Studies by Becker and Selden42have measured the stimulating effects of these electromagnetic elds for both the regulation ofthe nervous system and wound healing. Moreover, thecirculatory system, an excellent conductor ofelectricity, provides the primary channel for brainwaveoscillation, along with the electrical signals from allother cell structures, including the heart's much greatereld. 19In fact, the cardiac electromagnetic eld has the strongest vibrational frequency, roughly 40 to 60times stronger than that of the brain, 9measurable with SQUID-based magnetometers detecting vibration upto several feet off the body's surface. 41Fundamentally, all waves produced collectively entrain, theircoherence amplied by the sum of all energy elds,including sensation, movement, sound, and thought,and concentrically propagated throughout the systemalong with the larger waves of the brain and heart. The work of McCraty and colleagues 45focused on the influence of one's emotional state on the heart'selectrical eld coherence. Their recent studies utilize a\"freeze-frame\" method for measuring thesympathovagal balance of the heart rate variability.The freeze-frame technique teaches subjects toconsciously disengage from an unpleasant experienceand instead, focus on a sincere feeling and positiveemotion toward someone instead of the traditionalmethod of visualizing a past, positive memory. Thisself-induced technique has been used successfully todeal with emotion associated with current negativestressors. Heart rate variability analysis is used as anoninvasive test to distinguish sympathetic fromparasympathetic regulation of the sinoatrial node.The researchers were able to associate cardiacelectromagnetic coherence with positive and negativeemotional states. Coherence decreased with322 HOLISTIC NURSING PRACTICE NOVEMBER /DECEMBER 2009 demonstrated anger and increased with love, kindness, and a caring attitude.41,45The researchers indicate that those psychological strategies supporting an increaseof positive emotional states can improvecardiovascular function, possibly by inhibitingsympathetic efferent flow to the peripheral vascularcirculation. 45In addition, investigations further indicate that conscious human intention of sincerelove or appreciation can inhibit growth of tumor cellsin culture, 46as well as influence both DNA replication and conformation states of the DNA helix.41,46These studies collectively suggest that cardiac coherence canbe controlled by the individual and may, in fact, revealthe profound impact of the conscious mind on basiccell functions. 41,45,46 External Low-Frequency Stimuli and the Human Energy Field Animal responses to external low-electromagnetic frequency (EMF) stimuli have been demonstrated,with many of the effects linked to the nervous andendocrine systems. 47Becker and Selden's research42 evaluating the effect of EMFs on bone healing led tofurther study of the cellular and molecular foundationfor the effects of accelerated healing in other tissues.The Siskin and Walker 48review of hard and soft tissue responses to EMFs, including in vitro ,in vivo , and human models, expands this premise, citing efcacyresulting from the application of extremely low-levelfrequency (1-100 Hz) signals (Table 2). Other researchers have also considered the effects of these extremely low-frequency electromagneticsignals on cellular regulatory patterns. Lindstr\u00a8 om and colleagues 55have measured wide low-frequency TABLE 2. Healing effects from low electromagnetic frequencies applicationa Authors Frequency, Hz Site Effect Wilson et al4927 Animal: sciatic nerve transection Acceleration of nerve regeneration Barclay et al5027 Human: hand injuries Reduced wound swelling and pain; faster functional recovery Ito et al5172 Animal: sciatic nerve transection Accelerated restoration of motor function Stiller et al5222 Human Decreased pain intensity, wound depth and venous ulcers area Lin et al5310 Animal Increased tensile strength; capillary and patellar ligaments broblast Walker et al542 Animal Improved functional recovery; nerve sciatic nerve and Walker.48(5-100 Hz) effects on lymphocytes. They note an increase in interleukin production, indicating a similarresponse to that of antibody exposure, and speculatethat low-magnetic eld frequency may influenceintermolecular interactions necessary for signaltransduction. 55Liboff56has demonstrated that intrinsic ion cyclotron resonance frequencies exist for a numberof ions, including Ca 2+, with the concentrated strength of their electromagnetic energy likely compounded byexposure to the earth's magnetic eld. The existingtheory of cellular response and regulation indicatesreceptors interacting with selective endogenousligands. However, these studies show that oscillatoryelectromagnetic energy, and not peptides orneurotransmitters, can also cause changing of the cellmembrane gradient. The possibility thatcalcium-channel regulation could occur without theinterface of a ligand does not correspond with currentmodels of the understood function of ion channels.Liboff's inference is that the contribution of the ioncyclotron oscillatory resonance could be a part of aninformational signaling network of the cell and may infact be a natural outcome of biological evolution. 56 Human Energy Exchanges The concept of an energy exchange between peoplehas been the subject of many investigations. SigmundFreud, in The Anxiety Neuroses , proposed the possibility of the unconscious energeticclient-practitioner relationship affecting a change inthe overall well-being of the patient. 41According to Rubik,57coherent resonance can result from the same entrained frequency, whether induced by anelectromagnetic device or the practitioner's touch.The Science of Energy Therapies 323 Zimmerman58measured the biomagnetic eld emanating from the hands of a Therapeutic Touch(TT) (a nontouch technique) practitioner. Thepractitioner and his patient were situated in amagnetically shielded chamber containing a SQUIDdetector. As the TT practitioner relaxed into themeditative state, the pulsations ranged from 0.3 to 30Hz, with most of the activity at 7 to 8 Hz. The controlgroup of nonpractitioners was unable to produce thebiomagnetic pulses. Wirth 59evaluated the effects of TT on wound closure, noting marked acceleration.The study design effectively controlled for placeboinfluence by physically separating the practitionersfrom the 44 study participants. Gronowicz et al, 60also evaluating TT, measured the technique's effect on thegrowth of healthy human cells in vivo . The researchers were able to demonstrate an increase in tenocytes andbroblast proliferation. D'Andrea-Winslow andcolleagues 61evaluated a standardized \"hands near\" (nontouch)technique. They were able to observe a faster healingrate in the treated group, as compared with the controlgroup, evidenced by a more rapid presence of redspherule coelomocytes (effector cells of the immunesystem) at the wound site. The McCraty investigation 41concludes that the stronger electromagnetic eld generated by cardiaccurrent may, in fact, greatly amplify the effects of thisexchanged energy. Their data, using signal-averagingtechniques, reflect that the signal is strongest whenpeople are in contact but is still measurable whensubjects are in proximity without physical contact.This study demonstrates the potential fordistance-dependent transference of cardiac electricalcurrent between individuals. 41The work of McCarty and colleagues implies that the therapeutic modalitiesinvolving direct physical touch or within 18 in ofproximity, could be influenced by maintaining apositive emotional state, with the practitioner's eldcoherence potentially amplifying the effects on boththeir own and that of their client's cardiac elds. 41 These studies collectively indicate that energy ismeasurable and transmittable. The low-frequencyenergy exchanges emitting up to 18 in from the humanbody, a distance that would include both touch andmany nontouch therapies, indeed appears to interactwith biological tissue at the cellular level, therebymimicking a similar response to that of externallyapplied pulsing electromagnetic elds. Beck 19measured the EEG brainwave patterns and activity of practitioners of diverse healing modalitiesTABLE 3. Electroencephalogram measures of brainwave frequenciesa Frequency, Brain wave Hz Effect Delta 1-4 Deep sleep and certain brain disorders Theta 4-8 Light sleep, creativity, insight, and some emotional stressesincluding disappointment andfrustration. Alpha 8-12 Normal state of mind, reflecting a calm and peaceful yet alertstate Beta 13-21 Seen over the frontal portions of the brain during intensemental activity and/or anxiety;higher frequencies (up to50 Wisneski and Anderson,9Oschman,19and Huang and Charyton.62 from a variety of indigenous cultures. All were similar, averaging about 7.8 to 8.0 Hz during the treatmentsessions and coinciding with the brainwave's alpha(8-12 Hz) band at frequencies usually associated withrelaxation and meditation (Table 3). Beck's furtherevaluations of the practitioners discovered that theirbrainwaves were in rhythm with the Schumannresonance. This transverse waveband of low frequency(7-10 Hz) is the site of global electromagneticresonances, stimulated by lightning discharges in thecavity spanning the earth's surface and the ionosphere(uppermost part of the atmosphere) and again closelycorrelating with alpha brainwave frequency (8-12 Hz).Periodic entrained coupling of both the therapist's andpatient's brain and heart waves with similar coherentrhythms of the Schumann resonance may explain theunusual low-frequency emissions and calming state ofrelaxation common to many energy therapies. 19,29 Biochemical Substrates of Emotion Pert and colleagues have introduced the idea of apsychoneuroimmunology informational network inwhich neuropeptides serve as messengers throughoutthe body to every cell. 7,63Since then, researchers have demonstrated the intricate interactions between theimmune and neuroendocrine systems, which form a324 HOLISTIC NURSING PRACTICE NOVEMBER /DECEMBER 2009 2-way channel.64Neurons can have receptors for both hormones and neurotransmitters; many hormones canalso perform like neurotransmitters (distinguished asneuropeptides), and immunocytes can not onlysynthesize, store, and secrete, but also receive inputfrom neuropeptides. 64,65This overlap of transmissions among the nervous, immune, and endocrine systemswould indicate seemingly endless possibilities ofinteractions between stress and immunity. Approximately 80 existing neuropeptides have receptors inundating the limbic structures (emotionalcenter of the brain), the hippocampus (site ofmemory), and the amygdala (center for incomingsensory input for the negative emotions, such as fear,anger, and rage, as well as sexual feelings). 9Receptors have also been located in the heart and digestive tract,as well as in the sites where nerve cells relayinformation from the skin and various organs viasynaptic contact to the central nervous system. 6,7As a result, when relevant cognitive stimulus is received bythe brain, autonomic nervous system, or centralnervous system, this message is transmitted byhormonal pathways either directly or indirectly toreceptors on immune cells. This concept broadenswith the realization that any thought, aspect ofpersonality, and coping mechanism can affect manyfunctions, including aggression and sexual behavior,sleep, autonomic responses, as well as impactinghabitual and addiction patterns, memory, and learningabilities, ultimately influencing the course of diseases.These ndings indicate the potential magnitude ofone's emotional state impacting on biochemicalresponses to infection and neoplasms. Therefore,emotions, as the causal link between the mind andbody, become the physical basis of mental influenceon immune functioning and disease. 9,65,66Current research in neural-immune communication continuesto evaluate the role of emotion, specically activity inthe limbic structures and neocortex, leading to newtherapies in immune disorders. 67 From an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense that social/environmental conditions and concomitantemotional states\u2014fear, anxiety, sadness, anger,joy\u2014should have immunological correlates, becausethese conditions and emotions necessitate a more orless vigorous defense of the integrity of the self. Ouremotions provide a way to prioritize the competinginformation to which the body-mind must payattention. 7(p34) Analysis of cell changes such as shape, motility, and signal transduction demonstrates thatneuropeptides and their receptors \" ...vibrate, shimmy, and even hum as they change shapes,awaiting the arrival of their matching ligands.\" 7(p39) Because cells and intercellular components arecapable of shifting and vibrating in a dynamic manner,many authors 7,20,29appear willing to consider classifying the interface of energy-based models withneuropeptide-based models as a communicationalnetwork that integrates the electromagnetic bioeldswith membrane receptors. For example, consider boththe emotional and physical imprints of \"ecstasy\" or\"despair.\" Compartmentalizing these feelings as eitherenergetic or biochemical presents a challenge,because, in reality, the mind-body response to theseexperiences is concurrent and inseparable. 7\"...the pivotal role of emotional expression ...may be the best available marker for psychospiritual vitalizationof the life force ....\" 7(p40) MEDITATION AND THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND Meditation, an ancient tradition, supports the individual's transcending process throughcontemplation and reflection. It is an intentional andconscious \"mind\" process allowing one's conditionedreflexive reaction to develop into a clearer state ofawareness. Meditation allows the individual to accessthe alpha and theta brainwaves (Table 3) for deeprelaxation, as well as provides the opportunity forinsight into relationships between behavioralpatterning and physiological responses\u2014both statesfacilitated by differing or \"altered\" levels ofconsciousness. 68A consistent practice can provide a platform for a range of goals, from attainment of ahigher state of consciousness and self-awareness topersonal growth and transformation, or simply for apeaceful frame of mind. 68Various forms of meditative practices have evolved over the centuries andthroughout many cultures. Transcendental Meditationis the ancient Vedic tradition of enlightenment in Indiaand has been practiced for thousands of years. Thistechnique, in which practitioners concentrate on aspecic word or phrase, a \"mantra,\" eventually calmsdistractive thoughts, allowing the body to attain deeprest as the mind settles inward to a state of consciousalertness. Minimized sensory input combined with asingle focus of intense concentration (the repeatedmantra ) can facilitate hypnagogic reverie . This dreamlike transitional state between wakefulness andThe Science of Energy Therapies 325 sleep is considered the conscious but deeply relaxing experience of theta waves and can lead to clarity andinsight. 9,68In the early 1970s, Herbert Benson began evaluating the physiological differences ofTranscendental Meditation practitioners, such as thereduced response by the sympathetic nervous systemto stimuli, and by using the already-familiar term,relaxation response , he developed a \"relaxation\" procedure. Incorporating the features ofTranscendental Meditation common with those ofother world religious beliefs, Benson developed a veryeffective \"nondevotional\" relaxation method utilizedfor clinical applications. 69 Another form of meditation is the Buddhist practice ofVipassana , in which practitioners attend to their breath, training their mind to simply notice and accept,without thought, attachment, or judgment, theemotions, sensations, and perceptions as they surfacewhile letting go of mental distractions. 70Ar e v i e wb y Schwartz71suggests that this form of self-attention, or \"mindfulness\", has self-regulating and therapeuticeffects, especially when the self-attention incorporatesbiofeedback and relevant guided imagery. Delmonte 68 notes the efcacy of mindfulness meditation forcoping mechanisms as well as a source for well-beingand personal development strategies. Kabat-Zinn 72 took this technique and by extrapolating the elementof \"moment-to-moment\" awareness, createdMindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). MBSR is taught at more than 100 hospital-afliatededucational programs throughout the United States, aswell as internationally, with more than 17 000graduates of the program. 73 Jung and Fromm saw meditation as a method to access the unconscious mind through the \"altered stateof consciousness.\" 67(p45)This level of the subconscious reflects responses typical of thepreverbal period in childhood when focus is onimagery processing rather than on logical processing.Meditation is viewed as similar to free association inthat it can be a method to encourage \"loosening\" ofthe individualized, structured belief system, therebystimulating change and allowing for a new experience.As such, Delmonte 68suggests that meditation can promote insight as well as catharsis, producing agradual detachment and desensitization to repressedexperiences, which in the present can be reviewed,understood, and cognitively processed. A meditativediscipline can induce a varying depth of relaxationrelated to the technique, length of practice, and theexperience of the meditator. Experienced meditatorscan actually maintain a \"no thought\" level of cognitive stillness while continuing to be deeply restful andconsciously alert. This is a result of successfullylearning and practicing concentrative focus, as well asallowing the consistent processing of repressedissues. 68(p49) Brain Activity and the Influence of Meditation Studies looking at both the EEG and functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as assessmenttools have been used to evaluate brain activity duringmeditation. 74,75EEG changes in the course of meditation (Table 3) vary from an increase in alphaamplitude at the beginning, to eventual rhythmic thetatrains occurring with more experiencedmeditators. 74,76The fMRI studies during meditation show stimulation of brain structures associated withautonomic control (amygdala, hippocampus, andmidbrain) and attention (frontal and parietal basis for the relaxationresponse. 75Davidson et al77measured signicant increases in left-sided anterior inrelationship with improved immune responses byutilizing MBSR. Left-side anterior brain activation isassociated with positive emotional regulation and islikely due to a more adaptive response to and fasterrecovery from negative events and stress. The studydemonstrated a rapid rise of antibody titers toinfluenza vaccine, thus inferring a correlation amongmeditation, positive emotional states, and animprovement of immune function for those with agreater left-sided brain activation shift. 77 Davidson78suggested a direct connection among meditation, the right hemisphere (site of nonverbal andabstract thinking, loose associations, and clarity), andthe insightful processing of the subconscious mind.This relationship is consistent with studies 79 correlating the connection of a correct answertriggered subconsciously in the right hemisphere priorto cognizant retrieval, but only for solutions linkedwith the sudden awareness (the \"Aha\" moment) andwithout clear cognitive processing, consideredcharacteristic of insight and a distinguishing attributeof creativity. In fact, the study by Kounios andcolleagues 79of EEG changes during problem solving demonstrates this relationship. The researchersevaluated subjects who, while experiencing the restingbrain state, used the problem-solving strategy ofderiving sudden insight, versus those utilizing theanalytical \"search\" method, more prevalent during an326 HOLISTIC NURSING PRACTICE NOVEMBER /DECEMBER 2009 awake brain state. According to Kounios et al,79the sudden awareness of correct answers to verbalproblems was associated with short bursts ofgamma-wave activity, along with a correspondingincrease in fMRI signal originating in the rightanterior superior-temporal gyrus, and transmitted justprior to the subject's conscious awareness of thecorrect answer. These ndings may possibly reflectthat split second of clear insight. The researchers alsotheorized that both analytic and insight processing canoccur simultaneously, given the subconsciouscharacteristics of the right hemispheric activitycontributing to an insightful response. 79 Meditation and Pain Management A review by Bonadonna69of the many successful applications of meditation reflects reductions in stress,anxiety, and depression, as well as pain relief andimprovement of mood and self-esteem. Painmanagement, in particular, has been a focus of theevaluation of meditation techniques. Studies ofpractitioners of Eastern meditative rituals haverevealed the mind's ability to alter and control painperception, possibly via the periaqueductal gray regionof the midbrain and the site of opiate receptors. 7 Kabat-Zinn et al80evaluated of the use of MBSR and hatha yoga for chronic pain intervention over 4 yearswith 30% to 55% of the participants describingimprovement. More recently, a quasi-randomized trialand long-term observational follow-up study byGrossman et al 81demonstrates efcacy of MBSR for female bromyalgia patients with sustainedbenets over a 3-year period. Some authors note thatmeditation may enhance the individual's ability tomanage chronic illness, with the resultantself-awareness providing subtle internal cues allowinganticipation of an impending health crisis. 26,68,69 THE PARADIGM OF ENERGY MEDICINE The Einsteinian model of healing maintains diverse support in the elds of science and medicine. Manyview the human being as a multidimensional organismand consider that successful healing begins at theinterface of the complex energetic elds that underlieand contribute to the functional expression of thephysical body. Physicist Herbert Froehlich reiteratesthe energy eld theory, indicating that self-regulationis an outgrowth of an internal coherentbiocommunicational eld extending throughout the living organ systems. Predilection for a diseaseprocess may be an outcome of vibratory disturbanceof these energetic elds. Froehlich and colleaguesspeculate that resonant interventions arehealing specic; that is, certain external frequenciesare efcacious, with others causing vibratorydisturbance of the biocommunicational disease. 57 The \"dissipative structures\" or \"chaos theory\" perspective of influence on the complex energy eldtheory applies the principles of self-organizingsystems to humans and was instigated in the 1980s byIlya Prigogine and his colleagues. 29Prigogine views living systems as self-organizing and, while actuallyflourishing on instability, are able to generate orderfrom chaotic circumstances when necessary. 82These systems may respond to both internal and externalinfluence, leading to a new model of either increasingorder or chaos. The influences may be miniscule buteffective in creating new patterning and may be theenergetic source of either disease or health andwell-being. 29Rubik29further speculates on the concept of the chaos theory as an explanation for theefcacy of low-frequency electromagneticinterventions and the likelihood for subtle energeticstimuli producing amplied effects on living systemsindicating signicance for bioregulation and the futureof medicine. Rogers 83has established a solid foundation for energy healing techniques to be incorporated intonursing practice. Rogers 83believed that the human energy eld extended beyond the physical body,reiterating Bohm's perception of an ever-connectingand interacting universe. Her theory, Science ofUnitary Human Beings, considers the complex energyeld relationships of humans and their environment,with the principle of resonancy conceptualizing the developmental necessity of attaining ahigher-frequency wave coherency for good health andwell-being. 84Watson has extended Rogers' premise into the current nursing philosophy of energy practicewith her Intentional Transpersonal Caring-Healingmodel and challenges the individual to draw upon\"...deeper sources of inner healing ....\" 85(p15)Many within nursing literature86indicate the role of intentionality as an essential component of the healing experience. Watson contends that this intentionality isnot an aim that guides an action, but rather a mindfulconscious awareness, centering the practitioner'sThe Science of Energy Therapies 327 focused attention on the client.85This awareness cooperates instinctively within the energy eld,allowing resistance to reorganize and dissipate, thusreinforcing Prigogine's theory of self-organization,creating clarity from chaotic energy. She asserts thatintentionality and consciousness are united in the \" ... energetic eld of emerging possibilities ...\" 85(p14) creating a new vision of nursing practice. A rapid energetic/vibrational eld communication theory may account for the efcacy of systemwidebody therapies that energize, integrate, and organize,with an informational network regulating encodedsignal transmissions. 29We can now start to understand how these unique organizing elds signicantlyinfluence our physical and emotional balance, withindications as to why, for some, stress becomes arepetitive pattern of distress, eventually leading to acontinuous state of disease. A vibrational eldcommunication model allows for the concept ofhealing at the level of human energy. 26With consideration that the classical Newtonian approach islimited to physical interactions, an energetic model notonly will allow practitioners to conceptualize healingtechniques that are applicable at a more basic levelbut will also be integrative and more efcacious withour current medical model. Quantum realityprovides the key for understanding the dynamicrelationship between the structure of allopathicmedicine and fluidity of energy-based therapies. This\"new\" energy paradigm penetrates to the heart of theholistic mind-body-spirit, allowing us to step wellbeyond a compartmentalized outlook limited tophysical treatment and allow conscientiousall-encompassing investigations for progressivehealing models. THE LIFE-CHANGING PRACTICE OF ENERGY THERAPIES: THE PROCESSFOR SELF-TRANSFERENCE (or ...How to Stay Healthy for a Lifetime) Humans have an inherent tendency toward self-improvement, attempting to broaden our horizonsand search for life's purpose. This process ofcognizant pushing beyond our limits to expand ourboundaries is the experience of self-transcendence . 82 Self-transcendence has relevancy to all aspects of one's physical, mental, and spiritual life. However, thekey is the illuminating journey of self-discovery, thepath leading to our unfullled potential. Practicing self-transcendence demands personal involvement andeffort, a willingness to look inward, with anunderstanding that insight into one's emotionalinterpretation of past events and view of the future candirectly impact the present. 82Compelling events and chronic stress in our lives may lead us to realize thenecessity of self-transcendence. Reed 82purports that expansion of self-boundaries can provide positiveindicators for health and well-being. According toHaase et al., several authors have also noted thepositive effects of self-transcendence, including \" ... enhanced feelings of self-worth ...a greater sense of connectedness with others, nature and God ... personal growth ...nding purpose and meaning in life...and a sense of feeling healed.\" 87(p145)These statements certainly indicate the importance of self-transcendence to healthcare and nursing practice. And,in fact, Haase and colleagues 87note the self-transcendence concept evolving in commonalitywith nurse theorists Parse, Newman, Rogers, andWatson. Newman 88considers the expansion of consciousness as key to good health and well-being,with self-transcendence as an essential part of theprocess. Watson concurs with this introspective theoryin her Intentional TransPersonal Caring-Healingmodel, viewing consciousness as the foundation ofhuman transcendence. 85 Effective self-care approaches to encourage the personal expansion of boundaries and consciousnessof self-transcendence involve the experience of energytherapies 36enhanced restorative meditative practice.82According to Feinstein and Eden,89body-centered energetic therapies can be self-care tools and are considered by many36,85,90,91as a powerful foundation for the transformative processof emotional and physical repatterning, leading to amore stabilized response to stress as well as a moreconnected relationship to life in general. Theindividual can utilize energy therapies to ascertainenergy imbalances and apply appropriate measures, aswell as continue the maintenance of a healthierlifestyle by forestalling and even preventing distressand disease. 89,92The self-care transcending experience of energy therapies with a restorative meditativepractice, reflective of the holistic nursing model, is notonly personally applicable but may also be an idea toencourage for clients under stress, those with chronicdiseases as well as those looking for good health andwell-being. 92328 HOLISTIC NURSING PRACTICE NOVEMBER /DECEMBER 2009 ZERO BALANCING IS THE BRIDGE Zero Balancing is an energetic system of touch therapy that balances the relationship of energy andstructure within the bones and deep tissues of thebody. 90It was created in the early 1970s by Dr Fritz Smith, both a medical and osteopathic physician.Smith, after becoming an acupuncturist and withcontinued study including cranial osteopathy, Rolng(with Ida Rolf), yoga, meditation, and Taoism, wasable to gain an understanding that energy actuallyexists as a specic factor in the body. According toSmith, therapies involving the putative energy assessand use vibration as a healing tool. Regardless of thedistinction among techniques, that is, how variouspractitioners connect with the energy elds andwhether the technique is touch, nontouch ornonlocality/distance, these methods can contribute tothe restorative balance of vibratory energy. 36A reflection of his unique perspective, ZB bridges thegap between Eastern healing philosophies andtraditional Western science and medicine. Designed toheighten the harmonious balance, it follows a holisticmodel, transforming the mind, body, and spirit of theindividual. Smith, the author of Inner Bridges 36and The Alchemy of Touch ,92and the faculty of Zero Balancing Health Association at http://www.zerobalancing.com have taught thousands ofhealthcare practitioners internationally since 1973. Zero Balancing has been used for both acute and chronic disease states, as well as emotional andgeneralized stress conditions. 93Although not yet considered an evidence-based technique, ZB is one ofseveral methods reporting success within the eld ofenergy psychology. This emerging practice utilizesimagery and narrative-generated psychotherapy/counseling approaches paired with variousenergy-based interventions. 94Edmonds and Gafner93 report dramatically improved results with thecombination of hypnotic ego strengthening and ZB forthe treatment of depression and posttraumatic stresssyndrome for victims of torture. Williams, a physicianand Certied Zero Balancer with a private psychiatrypractice, also indicates ZB's signicant success as astand-alone treatment or paired with a variety ofpsychotherapy methods for treatment of dissociativeidentity, bipolar and panic disorders, as well aschronic pain, depression and attention-decithyperactivity disorder (M. Williams, DO, writtencommunication, February 2, 2009). Hollyday, anacupuncturist and Certied Zero Balancer at thePenn-North Clinic, in Baltimore, Maryland, has also noted successful outcomes for ZB as a stand-alonetechnique or in combination with traditional orauricular acupuncture for the treatment of long-termdrug addiction (G. Hollyday, MAc, writtencommunication, October 20, 2008). The foundations of the technique are rooted in natural law. ZB considers the additive potential of theforce elds of energy and bioinformation on thewave-particle duality moving cells andtissues. The entrains elds toincrease and amplify wave coherency. Applying thisinformation, ZB takes into account energy and theunderlying skeletal bone structure and addresses therelationship between the 2, perceiving the body as awhole. Many therapies recognize the connectionbetween energy and structure; however, most chooseto work with one or the other. For example,homeopathy and Reiki concentrate on energy, whilemodalities such as Rolng and chiropractic care attendto physical structure. ZB is unusual because it affectsboth simultaneously. The purpose is to bring about themost cohesive relationship possible between theenergy of the body and the physical bone structure. 90 This balanced relationship creates optimal functioningfor an individual. ZB is nondiagnostic of pathology,choosing, rather, to improve the daily circumstancesof living with a disease process. 90It is also a therapy for those who simply wish to enhance their well-beingand help prevent future development of disease. 95 Bridging Energy and Bone Zero Balancing focuses on the bone because it is thedeepest and strongest tissue in the body structure, ableto transmit and conduct mechanical forces whilecarrying powerful currents of energy. 90Piezoelectric current produced through stretch, compression, andtension and conducted via the rapid energycommunicational model of connective tissue, isdirected throughout the entire body, moving energyfrom bone to bone, indirectly affecting cartilage,ligaments, and soft tissue. 90The ZB practitioner evaluates the bone energy in the key foundation joints,such as the ribs, the sacroiliac joint, and thearticulations between the tarsal bones of the feet.These joints have limited range of motion, providingmechanical and energetic balance and leverage, ratherthan the freer motion associated with joints providingmovement and locomotion. And as such, these jointsare particularly suitable sites for influencing the flowThe Science of Energy Therapies 329 of energy.90In the absence of signicant musculature to absorb or respond to the stretch, creating a minimalbut well-targeted degree of tension, facilitated by thetouch of the therapist, can send a piezoelectric signalcausing greatly amplied consequences throughoutthe entire body. Since the foundation joints lack theproprioceptive interaction from muscle groups,dysfunctions and imbalances tend to remain just belowthe individual's conscious perception. 96Concentrating on these specic joints can expand the subconsciousboundaries into conscious awareness andcomprehension. As a result, ZB considers theseparticular sites to be a bridge connecting the subtleenergy elds and the physical structure of the body; abridge to reach unconscious boundaries, offering anew sense of potential and opportunities forchange. 36,97 Interface Touch The basic working premise of ZB is that both theenergy body and the physical body can be accessedtogether by a singular kind of educated touch, referredto as interface . Interface requires the skilled practitioner to have an intellectual and tactileunderstanding of energy in terms of tissue and bonetension. Energy boundaries are precise and clear, thatis, the client and the practitioner are energeticallyseparate within a nondependent relationship. 97A specic eld of tension is accomplished by using theinterface touch to construct the fulcrum , a precise and complex hold creating a single point of stillness, andpotentially inducing brainwave entrainment.Brainwaves move Hz) and with the meditative state deep relaxationand leading to the hypnagogic \"expanded\" state ofconsciousness. According to Edmonds and Gafner, 93 their clients' response during these moments appear tobe somewhat hypnotic, as well as a mild dissociation.Characteristic of hypnagogic reverie, 68this momentary body's behavioralpatterning, initiates a detachment and disconnection toillness or behaviors, with the ZB practitioner using thevibratory energy elds to release old emotional and/orphysical patterning and tissue-held memories, thusallowing the client to reintegrate a new experience.The fulcrum is the catalyst that instigates the internalregeneration and biological self-organizing capacityredening a clearer stronger (ie, more organized)energy eld. 36Delmonte68indicates the \"destressing\" or tension release as a result of loosening leads tofeelings of well-being. Clients' descriptions of theseexperiences during of maintaining attention instead of intention , thereby preserving a quiet mind and one open to possibilities, free of projection and perception.Free-flowing attention without demand for change can,in itself, be transformative. This is a belief couched inEastern healing philosophies. 90The Taoist concept of change does not result from a calculated action, butrather by innate spontaneity and in harmony withnatural order. The sixth century B.C. philosopher LaoTzu, considered the father of Taoism, is often quoted\"By non-action everything can be done.\" 98(p117)As a result, the ZB technique encourages the practitioner tomaintain attention along with sincere appreciation asan efcacious necessity. \"Attentiveness\" by thetherapist shares a common perspective with the\"person-centered\" psychotherapy approach of CarlRogers: the belief in the innate human ability to growand achieve one's fullest potential. 97Critical to this theory is the presence of a safe, supportive, andaccepting milieu. Rogers felt that when persons aresimply understood from their own point of view, andnot evaluated or judged, emotional healing couldoccur. 99According to Smith, ZB practitioners do not attempt to influence conditions, but instead hold theirclient in the highest regard with sincere appreciation.\"If you can balance something to neutral withoutjudgment or comparison by holding it in its ownspace, it will naturally move to its highest possiblepotential\" (F. Smith, DO, MD, oral communication,May 10, 2007). The positive emotional state derivedfrom sincere appreciation and a caring attitudeamplies the vibratory coherency of cardiac energyelds of the practitioner and client, effectivelyincreasing broader brainwave entrainment. 41,45Hence, the goal of the ZB practitioner is to simply create these2 circumstances, both serving to invite but not demandthe client's innate tendency toward self-transcendenceand healing. 97 ADDING THE SELF-RESTORATIVE PRACTICE OF MEDITATION A consistent meditative practice provides a foundation for the self-transcendence expansive experience of330 HOLISTIC NURSING PRACTICE NOVEMBER /DECEMBER 2009 energy therapies.36Meditation teaches us to consistently turn our attention to the presentmoment\u2014no past, no future. Frequent practice willtrigger the quieting of our state of mind, allowing us toproduce the desired brainwaves, alpha to theta. 62For example, as individuals follow consciousconcentration, they may notice color images(characteristic of alpha waves) shifting to black andwhite images (common to theta waves). 9The practice is learning to focus on ourselves, experiencing ahigher state of consciousness and self-awareness,connecting our thoughts with their emotionalconsequences. Attending to the present momentallows one to see the eventual detrimental effect ofinternalizing negative emotions. As we learn of theserelationships, we will also learn to make a consciouschoice, relating the cause and effect, as well as whattriggers negative and positive thoughts in our lives.Out of 60 000 thoughts experienced daily by anindividual, only 10% are new. 100A meditative practice can allow not only a mental refocusing but also aphysical disruption of the cumulative excitatoryautonomic cascade resulting from repetitive negativeemotions and possibly influencing the balance of thebody's sympathetic/parasympathetic response. 68,71,100 Emotional negativity, likely the product of long-term held beliefs and habitual patterns, can carry with it theconsequences of chronic stress in the forms ofheadaches, insomnia, anxiety, and pain, eventuallybecoming a vicious cycle. Delmonte 68notes emphasis on the self-transcendence aspect of meditation,whether the Eastern philosophy of moving beyondrepressed memories or the Western tradition ofinfusing gained insight into our daily lives. Theoutcome of a consistent practice from eitherperspective could be a reduction or even avoidance ofmany of the stress-related disease processes,profoundly impacting our future health. CLEARING OUR ENERGY FIELDS We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them. \u2014Albert Einstein Healthcare professionals seemingly race from task to task, a result of the demands of the job, the requisitestafng shortages, and treatment compartmentalism,not to mention the countless scenarios of exposure topain and disease with the accompanying feelings offrustration and guilt, ultimately ending in sadness and futility. And, unfortunately, our professional demeanordemands that we do not consider or place value onacceptance and resolution of these emotions as anintegral part of our process. All healthcare providersare educated to empathize and lessen suffering and yetwe do not learn to develop methods to identify andunderstand our own reactions and emotions,experienced and absorbed as a result of ourprofessional responsibilities. 101Daily exposure to stressful circumstances can cause any number ofunpleasant and unexpected personal responses. Insightinto these responses is necessary for maintenance andcontinued growth within the healthcare profession. Wesuffer through the unrealistic expectations that weplace on ourselves and others, the anguish of causingpain and the need to mask our emotions. 101Our patients' right to self-determination and autonomytaking precedence over our professionaljudgment\u2014even if we believe the consequence mayresult in higher risk for illness, harm, or evendeath\u2014is rmly entrenched within our ethicalphilosophies. 102However, accepting and providing the care prompted by our patients' decisions can threatenour personal spiritual beliefs. Many recognize that our own healing process of mind, body, and spirit allows us to share deep empathyand fully support others in need, thereby providing theessential component for our efcacy. 103The healing process, however, is the experience, expression, andacknowledgment of all our emotions. This personalclearing process leads to an integrative balanced flowof energy of the mind, body, and spirit. Pert andcolleagues 7advocate that basic emotions, such as anger, fear, grief, sadness, and joy, are all essential tothe full gamut of human experience and are a likelyoutcome of evolutionary adaptation. However,long-standing states of distress, such as helplessness,hopelessness, and despair, are often an outcome ofrepressed anger and the repetition of \"old\" issues andbehavioral habits and eventually becomeimmunosuppressive and deleterious to health. 7The key to this personal evolving progression, however, isthe awareness of our emotional process andacceptance of the necessity of healing ourselves, as weprovide healing for others. Without awareness, werender ourselves not only therapeutically ineffectivebut also incapable of moving beyond our own needs.For many, to consider \"ourselves\" rst does not comenaturally. However, neglecting our own emotionalissues will cause the draining of our energies, increaseThe Science of Energy Therapies 331 our burden of care, and leave us less likely to be able to accompany our patients along their own healingpaths. 103 By sheer numbers, the influence of healthy professionals will have a huge impact on thewell-being of our entire healthcare system. Those whonurture themselves recognize the connection betweentheir own healthy balance and how this influences theirability to focus and stimulate the innate healing withinthemselves and their patients. 103The physiologic evidence demonstrating the impact of varyingemotional experiences on cardiac eld coherency,coupled with the nding that this emotion is readilyabsorbed by others through entrainment, certainlyprovides an insightful explanation of the psychologicalinfluence by the individual. Realizing the tremendouspower of the putative energy exchanges resulting fromphysical contact or close proximity gives a muchgreater understanding of the potential depth and powerof the therapeutic bond between practitioners and theirpatients, no matter the circumstances or eld ofpractice. Our energy eld coherence has the capacityto entrain those around us with implications thatextend far beyond practitioner-patient interactions.Multiplying our energy elds with the ever-increasingand broader wave entrainment effects from othersbrings a new understanding to any interface, andespecially to the \" ...concept of touch as the rst and most fundamental means of communication andfacilitator of human interactions.\" 41(p367) Expanding our consciousness by learning, using, and receiving energy therapies and interventionaltechniques as well as developing and maintaining arestorative practice, we can transform our therapeuticconnection to a clearer and healthier level. We canincrease our ability to intrinsically attain and maintainlonger periods of the relaxed alpha and theta states,bringing a sense of focused awareness and calm to ourdaily lives. Our reactions and responses to stresschange as we are able to alter and even eliminatelong-held and repetitive behavioral perceptions. Welearn to give ourselves the opportunity to resolvelong-term, destructive patterns, likely a result of\"legitimate\" emotional or physical experiences;however, patterns that, now, simply \"no longer serve.\"This philosophy allows us to expand beyond ouremotions and \"the story,\" nding channels forresolution and freedom from the past. The centralconcept to understand involves the balance of ourconscious energy and how it can manifest as illness orwellness. Our energetic consciousness begins toevolve as we accept that in reality we are essentially spiritual beings existing in a physical state. Manytherapeutic strategies can address these imbalances;however, to achieve wellness, we must embrace theconcept of self-transcendence and look within andaccept responsibility for our own choices andrecovery. Our goal is to bring about the balance ofmind, body, and spirit by making positive changes thatwill remove the source of imbalance; otherwise,continued stress becomes distress with the potentialfor ensuing illness and disease. 26 Over time, our coherent entrainment amplies, enhancing the interactive energy elds with those inclose proximity. Our relationships, personal andprofessional, become clearer and healthier, allowingfor the grounded, nonjudgmental, and impartialtherapeutic support and key for the progression of ourpatients' healing. Maintaining this level of physical,psychological, and spiritual awareness for our patientsunderscores their experiences, allowing patience andacceptance to prevail. Simple listening skills that caninitiate a meaningful connection will come moreeasily and naturally, encouraging each unique \"story\"to be heard. This clearer connection is supportive of anempowering relationship in which patients alsobecome more aware and hopeful, more able to guideself-treatment and resolution, and therefore, morelikely to regain control over their lives. Consciousenergy has downstream effects, encouragingacceptance and contentment for those with majorillnesses or disabilities, with noticeable improvementin overall well-being and quality of life. The reality isas one continues self-transcendence by routinelylearning, giving, and receiving energy therapies whileadvancing and deepening one's own personal growththrough the restorative and contemplative traditions,the path to more life in health, relationships, career,spirituality, and creative expression will become veryclear\u2014with the infusion of new energy, vibrancy,insight, and inspiration. CONCLUSION Supported by the National Center for Complementaryand Alternative Medicine and coupled with expandinginterest from both the public and healthcareprofessionals, \" ...energy therapies are here to stay....\" 19(p2)While the technological advancement of allopathic medicine has impacted healthcareworldwide, clearly, there is an increasing mainstreamacceptance of these gentle complementary techniques332 HOLISTIC NURSING PRACTICE NOVEMBER /DECEMBER 2009 uniting their potential to reduce stress while enhancing quality of life. This inclusive response is the key forthe paradigm shift toward holistic approaches nowoccurring in healthcare. The next phase requires a newsystem for thinking about health and illness. Emergingresearch of innovative concepts is starting to reveal therelationship of illness versus good health in a clearlydifferent way, thus potentially illuminating a newdirection in healthcare. The practice of energytherapies is at the cutting edge in this new direction,and the emphasis must be on the safe, efcacious, andevidence-based integration into the Americanhealthcare system. The proposition of this article is not that physics proves the existence of conscious energy, but rather that quantum principles provide a conceptualframework of contemporary science, that is, a point ofreference, for those with a more Western philosophicalbackground. Opening our minds to the possibilities forenergy in healing challenges us to transcend ourconventional thought and consider \" ...what is unknowledgeable to one generation is mere technicalchallenge to another ...\" 104(p513)and realize that the true meaning of evidence-based practice is to exploremodern medicine as well as ancient cultures andintegrate all elements that demonstrate patientsatisfaction as well as efcacy. Understanding thatconventional acceptance of energy therapies will bedependent on the formulation of a solid sciencefoundation, we should also consider the necessity ofrevising the current biomedicine paradigm to apply ournew insights into successful therapeutic strategies. 22,57 Because energy therapies spotlight the individual's inner resources as the path to self-transcendence,self-awareness, well-being, and prevention of potentialhealth-related problems, they have possibilitiesbeyond simple acceptance. The influence of healthierprofessionals can greatly impact, and likelyrevolutionize, this future direction in healthcare. Ourcollective and conscious energy acknowledging thenecessity to heal from within can and will ultimatelychange the face of tradition, allowing the philosophyof self-responsibility to transform healthcare\u2014thevery reason many of us originally chose our careers.The mind-body-spirit holistic approach of energytherapies is our new vision of health and healing. This new paradigm is really about the art and science of healing. We are living on the verge ofcomprehending the natural processes that can promoteand maintain good health, longevity, and quality oflife. According to Gallup, \"If the focus of the 20th hasbeen on outer space, the focus of the 21st century may well be on the inner space. We are entering a new era of discovery\u2014not of the world around us, but of theworld within.\" 105(p212)The practice of energy therapies has opened the door into the biological foundations ofthought, feeling, and behavior and their connection tohealth and the conscious experience of life. Theserecent breakthroughs are revealing a newunderstanding of who we are, with the implicationstruly compelling. REFERENCES 1. Gazella K. Mark Hyman, MD: practicing medicine for the future.
