In reality, the majority of cultivated herbs used in these products are conventionally grown, using pesticides, herbicides, and chemical solvents! Restorative Formulations has set a standard unsurpassed by any other brand of supplements on the market by using 95% Certified Organic or wildcrafted herbs. By using certified organic herbs, we eliminate the possibility of toxic solvents finding their way into the final product. If the products you sell aren't labeled \"Certified Organic\" or \"Wildcrafted\" , then it is likely that pesticides and Class 2 and Class 3 solvents were used in the agricultural and manufacturing process. There is no legal requirement to list solvents, pesticides, or toxins on the label, so patients may unknowingly be exposed to chemicals that cause unexplained adverse reactions. Restorative Formulations is proud to be one of the very few manufacturers in the industry that meet strict organic standards, to help uphold our oath to \"first, do no harm\" .What Hidden Toxins Are Lurking In The Supplements Y ou Prescribe? 800-420-5801 www.restorative.comRestorative Formulations 93 Barre Street, Suite#1, Montpelier, VT 05602 fax: 800-621-187895% of our herbs and herbal extracts are certified organic or ecologically wildcrafted. 3Immunology Fundamentals and Current UpdatesHeather Zwickey, PhD Outcomes Recall immunology terminology Describe the immune response to infectious disease Apply immunological principlesto infectious disease -with respect to cytokine balance.

ADRENAL DOWN REGULATION Down regulation involves a decrease in the number of cortisol receptors in tissues, or ACTH receptors on the adrenal glands themselves, and ADAPTOGENIC herbs may help restore tissue status. ADRENAL SUPPORT FOR CHRONIC INFECTIONS : Stress and High Cortisol can suppress WBCs and other immune factors Low cortisol may also increase infection susceptibility Licorice is an example of an herb to support adrenal function, and is also shown to have anti -viral effects Eleutherococcus and all of the Adaptogenic herbs have substantial research regarding resisting and treating chronic infections. INDICATIONS FOR ADAPTOGENS AND LICORICE Subtle signs of adrenal weakness, or blunting of the HPA axis include easy fatigue, poor stamina, poor memory, depression, irritability, and frequent infections -the same symptoms that indicate the use of adaptogenic herbs. STRESS, HIGH CORTISOL, AND INFECTIONS Stress and High Cortisol can suppress WBCs and other immune factors. Flu virus symptoms are exacerbated by stress.

It has been shown to be active against the malaria -causing plasmodium organism via affects on its mitochondrial membrane. Eleutherococcus is one of the northern hemisphere's primary adaptogens that has been researched for many decades. Listed in the USP as early as the 1800s for fatigue, stress, and infections Eleutherococcus senticosis Siberian Ginseng Eleutherococcus senticosus , Siberian Ginseng or Eleuthero. The plant is known as Shigoka in Japan and Ciwujia in China where is has been widely used to invigorate qi/chi, meaning general energy and vitality. Eleutherococcus Traditional Uses ELEUTHEROCOCCUS Traditional uses emphasis Eleuthero for fatigue, poor stamina and stress intolerance. Eleuthero is also used for nervous and mood disorders such as depression, mental fatigue, and poor concentration. Eleuthero is helpful to treat chronic and acute infections, improve immune function, protect against toxins including hepatotoxins, neurotoxins, and cerebral vascular inflammation. Eleuthero may improve cardiovascular inflammation, treat ischemic disorders, hypertension, and hepatitis. ELEUTHERO Eleuthero has fairly extensive molecular, animal and human research demonstrating anti- stress, antiulcer, senticosus polysaccharides and its antioxidant activity.

Many medicinal mushrooms may contain beta glucans. Polyporus umbellatus contains beta glucans shown to be a potent activator of B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Shitake mushrooms, Lentinus edodes also contains the beta glucan lentinan thought to contribute the immune potentiating properties of this medicinal food. \u00a1Glucans are natural occurring plant carbohydrates that stimulate immunity. \u00a1Glucans are taken into cells such as macrophages due to the pattern recognition receptor, Dectin -1. \u00a1Once taken up glucans colocalize with endosomes within minutes, and in the golgi appartus in minutes to hours. \u00a1Clathrins support the uptake of Glucans , and caveolin inhibit uptake. Beta glucans contribute greatly to water holding properties in plants and have many anti - cancer and immunomodulating effects, and anti -inflammatory effects on the GI. Beta glucans may help lower cholesterol. Beta glucans also occur in brewer's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae , contributing to immune -modulating effects. \u00a1Seaweeds are of the richest sources of sulfated polysaccharides. \u00a1Sulfated glycans may interact with cellular polysaccharides in manner that enhances immune response.

However, new evidence suggests other biting insects may transmit LD as well. In the early 1970's, mysterious cases of rheumatoid arthritis developed in several children in Lyme, CT. Many of the children recalled having a rash and/or being bit by a tick. In 1981, Dr. Willy Burgdorfer who had been studying Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever discovered the spirochete that caused the illness in these children. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Lyme Disease: What Is It? There at at least 5 subspecies of Borrelia burgdorferi and at least 100 other strains of Borrelia in the United States. There are more than 300 strains worldwide. More than 95% of reported cases in the United States come from Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin. There are at least 300,000 new cases of Lyme disease reported each year in the United States with now millions of people living with Lyme disease annually. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Lyme Disease: Canadian Stats In Canada, there have been less than 1000 cases of Lyme disease reported in 2016 (987). However, there has been more than 6 -fold increase in Lyme cases since 2009.In 2015, 91% of all cases were reported from Ontario, Nova Scotia and Quebec, with Nova Scotia having the most cases (26 per 100,000). As in the US, the incidence of Lyme is growing rapidly and likely grossly underreported. In Ontario, Public Health officials state Lyme is only caused by Borrelia burgdorferi , but research has proven this to be untrue. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND What Is It? Lyme disease is the #1 spreading vector -borne epidemic worldwide. Borrelia species can infect any tissue or organ system. Therefore, multiple symptoms are observed with patients with LD. Borrelia species may also change forms and have a relatively slow replication cycle. Most bacteria replicate every 20 minutes to 8 hours. Borrelia replicate every 1 to 16 days. Borrelia species are the ultimate shape -shifters. They can exist as a spirochete (corkscrew form), cyst form, cell -wall deficient form form. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND 41What Are The Symptoms Of Acute Lyme Disease? Headaches and neck stiffness Fever Arthritis with swollen joints and/or spine pain Muscle pain Erythema migrans (\"bullseye\" rash) Fatigue Chills Swollen lymph nodes Heart palpitation Shortness of breath Memory loss Facial palsy (Bell's palsy) Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND What Are The Symptoms Of Acute Lyme Disease? Erythema migrans rash Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND What Are The Symptoms Of Acute Lyme Disease? Acute symptoms can occur anywhere from 3- 30 days following a tick bite. CDC states up to 70% of people infected with Lyme disease get the erythema migrans (EM) rash, but others suggest less than 40% of infected people get the stereotypical EM rash. The EM rash is pathognomonic for LD, which means there is no other organism that causes this type of rash. Most people with LD have no recollection of ever being bitten by a tick! Lyme disease symptoms are often vague and resemble numerous other infectious disease and autoimmune conditions. Misdiagnosis is common. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND What Are The Symptoms Of Chronic Lyme Disease? Fatigue Abdominal pain and bowel changes Memory loss or cognitive impairment Numbness or tingling of extremities Sensory distortion of skin (burning sensations), especially in hands or feet \"wandering\" symptoms Light or sound sensitivity Dizziness or vertigo Sleep disturbances Rheumatism Cardiac problems: MVP, heart block, heart palpitations, chest pain Balance or coordination problems.

Worldwide, we are seeing an increase the in the number of cases of LD as well as other vector -borne illnesses. We have already seen epidemics of Dengue virus in South America, Ebola virus in Western Africa and Chikungunya virus in Central and South America (now spreading to North America). Ticks, fleas, mosquitos, flies and even snails can transmit these illnesses. The World Health Organization (WHO) anticipates that climate change will result in an increased incidence of vector -borne diseases. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Why The Rise in Lyme Disease? According to the WHO... Climate change and vectorborne diseases Many vulnerability assessments anticipate climate change will result in increased incidence of communicable diseases including vectorborne diseases (VBDs). VBDs are transmitted by the bites of infected mosquitoes and other insects (vectors). Their incidence is particularly dependent on climatic factors because: Insects have no internal control over their physiological temperatures and the ambient temperature determines their reproduction rate, biting behavior and survival: their distribution may expand as the earth warms. Humidity and availability of water for breeding are also determinants of vectors' distribution, longevity and behavior. The incubation period of pathogens inside vectors is temperature -dependent (and tends to decrease at warmer temperatures). Human behavior is likely to be affected by climate change which will alter our interaction with vectors and the diseases they carry. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDhttp://www.wpro.who.int/mvp/climate_change/en/ Why The Rise in Lyme Disease? Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Diagnosis of Lyme Disease The CDC criteria for LD was designed for surveillance purposes and do not necessarily reflect active infection with Borrelia species. The diagnosis of LD is a CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS! There are over 100 strains of Borrelia in North America and more than 300 strains worldwide. Current testing only tests for Borrelia burgdorferi. We now know that half of West Coast cases of Lyme disease are caused by Borrelia miyomotoi. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Diagnosis of Lyme Disease Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Diagnosis of Lyme Disease Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND 43Diagnosis of Lyme Disease CDC Criteria 1.Positive ELISA blood test. This is the screening test most doctors use through reference labs. 2.If the ELISA test is positive, they will then run a Lyme Western Blot, which is a more detailed antibody test looking at specific antibodies (called \"bands\") associated with the organism. They will look at IgG and IgM antibodies. 3.If 5 out of 10 IgG bands are positive or 2 out of 3 IgM bands are positive, the test is considered \"positive\". These criteria have not changed in more than 40 years of research on LD.

If you don't look, you won't find it. 4.It can take up to 6 weeks to produce antibodies once someone has been bitten by a tick, so no reliable testing for acute cases. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Diagnosis of Lyme Disease The International Lyme and Associated Disease Society (ILADS) have established a different set of criteria for diagnosing LD and coinfections. ILADS doctors often diagnose patients based on their clinical symptoms in conjunction with lab tests that shows that someone has had exposure to a particular organism(s). Other inflammatory and autoimmune illnesses must be ruled out as well, since LD mimics many other conditions.

Patients who have suffered for many years with LD or have been disabled start to function again. Even if a patient had been exposed to a tick many years prior, often these treatment regimens help. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Antimicrobial Therapy: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly The Bad Many patients also experience die -off reactions called Herxheimer reactions (aka \"herxing\"). These are flu -like symptoms that occur as the organism is being killed and can last days to weeks in some individuals. Combinations of antimicrobials can have undesired side effects, including nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headaches. Long -term antimicrobial use can cause liver or other organ damage, so blood count, liver and kidney function need to be monitored closely. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Antimicrobial Therapy: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly The Ugly Combination antimicrobials can wipe out your normal bacterial flora in the gut, causing Clostridia difficile or yeast infections, which then need to be treated with other stronger antimicrobials or antifungals. Some antimicrobials suppress your own immune system, making it more difficult for you to fight your own infections. We don't fully understand the consequences of long -term antibiotic use in LD and how it disrupts the normal gut microbiome. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Diet for Lyme Disease There are many diets out there that promote various health benefits. I find most people with Lyme disease do well when they consume an alkaline diet. pH is tightly regulated by the body. Blood pH is between 7.2- 7.4. With exception to the stomach, bladder and vagina, most of our tissues are alkaline. Our cells and receptors function best at an alkaline pH. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND 46Diet for Lyme Disease Foods that be consumed often: Vegetables (eat all you want): Artichokes Asparagus Beets and beet greens Broccoli Cauliflower Celery Chard Green Seaweeds (Nori, Dulse, etc.) Scallions Spinach Sprouted grains Sprouts Tomatoes (raw only) Turnips Zucchini Vegetables (eat no more than 1 serving a day): Sweet potato Squash Yams Fruits: Avocado Grapefruit Lemon Lime Pomegranates Watermelon Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDFoods that can be consumed often: Vegetables (eat all you want): Artichokes Asparagus Beets and beet greens Broccoli Parsnips Peas Seaweeds (Nori, Dulse, etc.) Scallions Spinach Sprouted grains SproutsTomatoes (raw only) Turnips Zucchini Vegetables (eat no more than 1 serving a day): Sweet potato Squash Yams Fruits: Avocado Grapefruit Lemon-Lime Pomegranates Watermelon Diet for Lyme Disease Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDGrains/Legumes: Amaranth Buckwheat Chia Kamut Lentils Lima beans Millet Mung beans Navy beans Pinto beans Red beans QuinoaSpelt White beans Nuts/Seeds: Almonds Brazil nuts Coconut Flax seeds Pumpkin seeds Sesame seeds Sunflower seedsOils: Avocado oil Coconut oil Flax oil Olive oil Safflower oil Beverages: Alkaline water Herbal teas Green drinks Water Diet for Lyme Disease Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDFruits: Apples Apricots Berries Papaya Pineapple PlumsNuts/Seeds: Pecans Hazel nuts Grains/Legumes: Brown rice White rice Oats Rye Hemp Soy (organic only) Oils: Sunflower oil Grapeseed oilMeat, Fish, Eggs: Beef Chicken Eggs Farmed-raised fish Pork Shellfish Turkey Fish (wild only): Mackerel Perch Pike Roughy Salmon Sardines Sole, TilapiaFoods that may be eaten in less than 20% of your weekly dietary intake: (neutral pH or slightly acid -forming) Diet for Lyme Disease Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDDairy Products: Cheese Ice cream Milk Sour cream Yogurt Fruits: Dried fruits Nuts/Seeds: Macadamia nuts Peanuts Pistachios Beverages: Alcohol Black tea Coffee Fruit juiceRefined, Processed and Simple carbohydrate Foods: All additives Artificial dyes, flavorings and sweeteners Candy, cookies, doughnuts, crackers Canned foods (they tend to contain lots of preservatives and chemicals) Chocolate/Cocoa Corn and all corn products (corn syrup, corn starch, etc.) Chips Margarine Preservatives (Sulfites,Nitrites, etc.) Sugar YeastCondiments: Honey Jam Jelly Mustard Soy sauce Vinegar Oils: Corn oil Cottonseed oil Soybean oil Vegetable oil All hydrogenated oils and trans fatsFoods to avoid while on the program: Treatment of Lyme Disease Cowden Protocol : developed Lyme Disease Modified claw) Rich in pentacyclic oxindole alkaloids (POA's), which help stimulate the immune system to fight infection Is a potent anti -inflammatory Useful for treating coinfections Little to no side effects Free of TOA's, which may inhibit action of POA's Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND 47Treatment of Lyme Disease Modified Cowden Protocol Banderol Derived from Otaba tree in South America Broad spectrum activity against Lyme and coinfections Is a potent anti -inflammatory Works well in conjunction with Samento.

Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Modified Cowden Protocol Cumanda Derived from bark of Campsiandra angustifolia tree in South America. May be the most broad spectrum herb against Lyme and coinfections. Used locally to treat malaria. Is a potent anti -inflammatory. Used to treat arthritis and fever. Can produce significant Herxheimer reactions. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Modified Cowden Protocol Burbur Derived from leaves of Desmodium molliculum, an Amazonian plant. Used primarily for detoxification purposes, especially the liver, kidneys and lymphatics. Can protect against toxic effects of other medications. Beneficial to minimize or stop Herx reactions. Can use every 10 minutes if Herx reactions becomeintolerable for patients. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Modified Cowden Protocol Acute Lyme Disease: Start with Samento, Banderol and Cumanda Give 15 -30 drops 2 times per day in 1 oz water of each for 30 days. May add Burbur if Herxheimer reaction is strong. If patient starts Herx reaction, keep dose the same. Only increase dose if there is no improvement or reaction. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Modified Cowden Protocol Persistent Lyme Disease: Start with Samento, Banderol, Cumanda and Burbur Give 2 -4 drops 2 times per day in 1 oz water of each. Increase by 1 drop 2 times per day every 3- 4 days if there is no reaction or improvement up to 30 drops twice a day. If patient starts Herx reaction, keep dose the same. Give 10 drops of Burbur every 10 minutes for severe Herx reaction. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Cowden Protocol Combinations of these products are used to help kill the microbes, support detoxification and clear heavy metals. It is a 5 month protocol with the combination of herbs changing each month. Since these are liquid extracts and drop doses are administered, it is possible to use in children. Dose can be altered based on body weight. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND 48Treatment of Lyme Disease Cowden Protocol Advantages: easy to administer (relatively), clinically beneficial, reasonably cost -effective. Disadvantages: Herx reactions common, long -term treatment, requires multiple bottles and dosing schedule (labor intensive). Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Let's take a break ....... Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Zhang Protocol : developed by Dr. Qincao Zhang, LAc Treatment of Lyme Disease Zhang Protocol Dr. Zhang's protocol helps eradicate the infections, improve circulation, reduce inflammation and improve detoxification. It is one of the most comprehensive herbal protocols to address each aspect of LD. I use this protocol for 3 -6 months, depending on patient's response. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Zhang Protocol : Allicin Caps Allicin is one of the active ingredients in Allium sativum (garlic). Allicin Caps contain allitridi, which gets converted to allicin. Well-established anti -microbial, but also helps improve circulation and is mild anti- inflammatory. Time released caps, so allicin gets absorbed over a longer period of time. Patients will definitely excrete it through their skin, so may be socially problematic for some.

Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Managing Herxheimer Reactions AI#3: take 1 cap 3 -4 times per day before meals. Burbur: take 10 drops every 15- 30 minutes in 1 ounce of water. Curcumin ( Curcuma longa ): use companies that have well -studied forms that are well absorbed. Take 2 -3 capsules 3 times per day before meals. Boswellia ( Boswellia serrata) 400 mg: this is an herb from India that has a long history of use as an anti-inflammatory. Take 1 -2 caps 3 times per day before meals. White willow bark ( Salix alba ) 400 mg: this herb contains salicin, a component similar to that found in aspirin. Take 1 -2 caps 3 times per day before meals. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Managing Herxheimer Reactions Alkalizing your body will also help keep Herxing under control. You can take a bicarbonate formula to help keep you more alkaline. I recommend taking: Alka Seltzer Gold: take 1 tablet 3 -4 times per day in 2-4 ounces of water and drink. Tri-Salts: 2 capsules 3 times per day. Baking soda: \u00bc tsp 3- 4 times per day. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Breaking Down Biofilm Biofilm is produced by many bacteria, including Lyme and is composed of extracellular DNA, proteins and carbohydrates ...AKA \"slime\". Biofilm enhances microbial adhesion to host cells and to each other. Biofilm protects the microbe against innate and humoral immune responses and can lead to antibiotic resistance. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Breaking Down Biofilm Biofilm busting enzymes -there are several products that contain enzymes that will help digest the biofilm and break it down. I use serrapeptase a lot and find it works well. I give between 40,000 - 60,000 U per day away from food. Nattokinase is another enzyme derived from natto, a fermented soy product. I give 20,000 FU 2 -3 times per day away from food. For more difficult patients, I often use lumbrokinase, an enzyme derived from a type of earthworm. The enzyme activity is about 10 times that of nattokinase, but is also significantly more expensive. I specifically use Boluoke, as it has the best research behind it. Take 1 capsule 2 times per day, which delivers 600,000 U per day in total. Interfase Plus: this product contains enzymes with the addition of disodium EDTA and chitosans that also help break down biofilm. Take 1 -2 capsules twice a day between meals. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Breaking Down Biofilm Lactoferrin: this molecule binds up iron, which effectively prevents the formation of biofilm. Be careful if patient is already iron deficient or anemic. It is also not be to be taken if they have a dairy allergy, as it is derived from dairy and could worsen symptoms. Take 600 mg 1 -2 times per day. Xylitol: this is a low carbohydrate sweetener that is naturally found in low amounts in some fruits and vegetables. It has been shown to make the biofilm weaker in dental studies. Although it is safe for humans, it is extremely toxic to dogs, so avoiding keeping around pets. Give 1 tsp 3 -4 times a day in water or juice to start and you can increase up to 1 Tbsp. 3 -4 times a day. Some people get gas and bloating with xylitol, so you may have to ramp up the dose slowly. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND 52Treatment of Lyme Disease Breaking Down Biofilm Coconut oil (organic): coconut oil has been used to treat various infections, including bacterial and yeast infections and contains a compound called monolaurin. It also has the ability to disrupt biofilm formation. Give 1Tbsp twice a day in food. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC): this is an amino acid that has been used to help break up mucus in the body and has been shown in numerous studies to break up biofilm. Give 200 -600 mg 3 times per day. NAC may deplete zinc and copper when usedlong-term, so I recommend supplementing with these minerals if you take NAC for more than 2 months. NAC can cause gastrointestinal distress in some individuals and should not be taken by anyone with an active stomach ulcer. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Boosting Immune Function 1.Vitamin C: vitamin C helps with active infections and may help improve the effect of antibiotics. Test tube studies show large doses of vitamin C may inhibit the growth of bacteria or kill it altogether. Take 1000 mg 2 -3 times per day. 1.Vitamin D: many Lyme patients are vitamin D deficient. Vitamin D is a hormone that helps modulate the immune system. Give 2000 -4000 IU per day with food. Higher doses may be needed if serum 25 -hydroxy vitamin D is still low after supplementation. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Boosting Immune Function 3.Zinc: It is an effective anti- viral and anti -inflammatory nutrient. Give 30- 50 mg per day with food. It is essential to take zinc with food or it can make patient nauseous if they take it on an empty stomach. Long -term use of zinc supplements can induce a deficiency of folate or copper. 4.Andrographis ( Andrographis anti- anti -inflammatory herb. I prefer using an encapsulated standardized extract. I recommend taking 300 - 400 mg twice a day of a 50% andrographolide product. Andrographis is not for people with autoimmune conditions that are not related to Lyme disease, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis as it may exacerbate their symptoms. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist, but at low doses appears to enhance endogenous opioid production.

Think of pushing a child on a swing, then when you push in the direction the child is moving, they go higher. If you push in the opposite direction, it will slow or stop the child's motion. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Pulsed Electro -Magnetic Frequencies (PEMF) PEMF devices are designed to produce a series of very low electromagnetic frequencies that fall within a biological window that resonate with human cells. There are over 1 million receptor on any given cell and applying the right EMF may help stimulate these receptors to alter cellular function. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Pulsed Electro -Magnetic Frequencies (PEMF) Our bodies are exposed to numerous EMF daily via WiFi, electrical wiring in home or office, cell phones, cordless phones, etc. Some of the frequencies can be damaging, while others are healing. The goal is to find the right frequencies that help stimulate the body toward better health. Most of medicine focuses on the chemistry of the body and virtually ignores the physics of the body. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Pulsed Electro -Magnetic Frequencies (PEMF) Potential benefits include: Improved circulation Decreased pain Reduced inflammation Faster recovery after injury or surgery Faster healing of skin wounds Acceleration of nerve regeneration Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND 54Treatment of Lyme Disease Pulsed Electro -Magnetic Frequencies (PEMF) There are over 1600 studies on the use of PEMF devices and most devices are currently FDA approved in the US. Some devices are designed for home use and others for professional use. I recommend 2 treatments per week. Each treatment can be short (8 minutes) to longer (75 minutes). This is a great, non-invasive approach that can be customized to the individual. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Detoxification Therapies IR Sauna Constitutional hydrotherapy Drainage remedies (Unda, Pekana, Marco Pharma, Seroyal) Exercise (gentle): yoga, tai chi, stretching, etc. Colon hydrotherapy Even the most difficult Lyme patient can respond to these therapies, even when others have failed! Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): developed by Dr. Ty Vincent We recognize that many microorganisms can trigger an autoimmune reactions once someone has been exposed to that organism. Rheumatic fever following strep infection is well- known in the medical community as a consequence of having had strep, even once the infection is eradicated. Molecular mimicry of a microbe can create an autoimmune reaction against our own tissues. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI) If a microorganism is capable of turning on the immune system against our own tissues, how effective will antimicrobial therapy be? Reducing the load of the microbe may certainly lessen the immune response, but does it completely stop an autoimmune reaction? Does this explain why people flare periodically, even though they have been undergoing antimicrobial therapy for months or years? Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI) The goal of LDI is to promote tolerance to the offending antigen using homeopathic doses of nosodes mixed with beta-glucuronidase. Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme that was found (by mistake) to help build immune tolerance to whatever coexisted with the enzyme. This enzyme has been used with low dose allergy (LDA) therapy for the treatment of allergies to foods, mold, pollens and chemicals. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI) The antigen is selected by the doctor depending on what organism(s) are suspicious to be causing symptoms. The dose selected is dependent on the sensitivity of the individual. Intradermal or sublingual doses are administered every 7-8 weeks depending on patient response. In many cases, clinical improvement has been observed within 24-48 hours. However, it can take a few weeks to see the full benefit of the treatment dose. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND 55Treatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): Case 1 15 year old girl with autism Jill has been in treatment with autism since she was 2 years old doing various biomedical and immune modulating therapies, all of which have helped to varying degrees. Her current primary issues are scripting, hyperactivity and lack of focus. She has also has intermittent skin rashes. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): Case 1 15 year old girl with autism Jill had been tested for Lyme disease and coinfections, which none of the tests were positive. She had a history of candidiasis however and had been on antifungal therapy for many years. I gave Jill Candida Mix 10C sublingually. The next day, her mother called and said that she was completely calm and more mentally \"clear\". The scripting was less and her skin was not as itchy. After 2 months, she is stable and has not regressed. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): Case 2 9 year old boy with tics John had been having vocal and neck tics for a few months when the mother brought him to our clinic. He was tested and treated for food allergies, which helped reduce his tics significantly. However, the tics had not completely resolved. I tested him for PANDAS and he was positive for ASO and DNAse B antibodies, despite having had a negative throat culture. He had a history of Lyme disease when he was 3 -4 years old, which was treated with antibiotics at the time. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): Case 2 9 year old boy with tics I gave John a Strep Mix 10C and the mother reported no noticeable changes. I gave him a Strep Mix 9C the following week and again, no noticeable changes in his tics. I then tried the Lyme Mix 10C and that following day he had a severe headache. The following day, the headache dissipated and the tics completely stopped. He has now been tic -free for 3 months Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): Case 3 47 year old woman with Lyme disease Susan had a h/o chronic neck and shoulder pain, fatigue and joint pain. She had seen several doctors, including a rheumatologist who ran many labs for autoimmune disease, which were all negative. Went to a large autoimmune clinic in TX and was put on AI diet and Rx many supplements, which helped, but did not resolve her Sx. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): Case 3 47 year old woman with Lyme disease Susan was tested for Lyme and coinfections and found to have a + Lyme Western Blot IgG and IgM. She was referred to my office for Tx. I started her on an alkaline diet, Dr. Zhang protocol and gave her LDI Lyme 12C. She reported the next day her neck pain had improved by 90%. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND 56Treatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): Case 3 47 year old woman with Lyme disease Over the next month, her neck and joint pain almost completely resolved. Her energy was better and she was becoming more physically active again. She was doing well for about 6 months and then started to have RUQ pain. She had U/S and MRCP which showed dilated common bile duct, but otherwise negative for cholecystitis or obstruction. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): Case 3 47 year old woman with Lyme disease Over the next month, her neck and joint pain almost completely resolved. Her energy was better and she was becoming more physically active again. She was doing well for about 6 months and then started to have RUQ pain. She denies irregular BM, constipation or diarrhea. She had U/S and MRCP which showed dilated common bile duct, but otherwise negative for cholecystitis or obstruction. CDSA was unremarkable, except no yeast growth. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): Case 3 47 year old woman with Lyme disease I then gave her LDI Candida 12C and her abdominal pain was 50% improved within 48 hours. I saw her 2 weeks later and gave her a booster dose of Candida 13C, which continued to help her Sx. After a second dose of Candida 12C, her RUQ pain is gone. She is currently doing well and RUQ pain has not returned. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Treatment of Lyme Disease The treatment of LD cannot be a single treatment approach. It is a complicated illness and the treatment needs to encompass many aspects of improving immune health. 1. Treat the organism(s) if it is acute. 2. Treat other immune distracters such as food allergies, environmental allergies, etc. 3. Detoxify the body. Eliminate heavy metals. 4. Fix endocrine dysregulation. 5. Get proper sleep. 6. Reduce inflammation. 7. Improve nutritional status. 8. Improve mitochondrial function. 9. Improve circulation. 10. Reduce autoimmunity. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND The Lyme Solution Lyme Paradox Infections: When Fundamentals of Infection C&C Infections 2/4/18: Darin Ingels, NDQuestions to ask yourself when you have a patient who is prone to chronic infections: 1.What is it about this person that disposes him or her to these infections? 2.What is in their environment that may create imbalance in the body's ecosystem? 3.What lifestyle factors are harming the patient and setting them up for illness? 4.What microbes are normally present in the tissues where they have the most weakness and get ill? 5.Is the infectious agent truly foreign or part of us? 6.Do we need to treat the infection or just support the immune system? Fundamentals of Infection C&C Infections 2/4/18: Darin Ingels, NDInfection is caused by the invasion and replication of microbes, the production of endogenous toxins produced by the microbe or the immune response to the microbe. Remember ...there are 10X's as many microbes as cells in our bodies! Symptoms may be precipitated by: Bacteria Viruses Fungi or yeasts Parasites Arthropods Prions Others? Most of the symptoms associated with infection is the immune reaction to the infection. Fundamentals of Infection C&C Infections 2/4/18: Darin Ingels, NDWe are exposed to microbes all of the time. We get \"infected\" through eating food and drinking fluids, brushing our teeth, sexual activity, touching everything around us, breathing, etc. Tissues one believed to be sterile, such as the bladder or small intestine are now known not to be sterile. Have we inadvertently become too sterile? Has loss of beneficial microbes actually predisposed toward persistent or chronic infections? Has the overuse of antibiotics wiped out our protective microbes? Read \"The Dirt Cure\" by (AOM) 2.Otitis Media with Effusion (OME) AOM: sudden onset with acute ear pain. Typical ear infection that brings most patients to the office for treatment. OME: pain is rarely part of the symptom picture, but patient describes fullness in ear. Can last weeks to months. Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is when AOM lasts longer than weeks. Otitis C&C Darin Ingels, NDCauses of AOM: 1.Anatomy: horizontal Eustachian tubes do not allow for proper drainage. This is the most popular theory of why children get AOM. 2.Allergies: the accumulation of serous fluid in the middle ear allows for the growth of bacteria and viruses. Allergies to foods, mold, pollen, dust, animal danders and others can trigger inflammation in the middle ear. 3.Particulate inhalants: cigarette smoke, pollution, etc. 4.Other upper respiratory illnesses, such as colds, flu, etc. 5.Enlarged adenoids: block opening to Eustachian tube. Darin Ingels, Viruses may also cause AOM, but are usually a part of a larger URI. Common viruses that are associated with AOM include RSV NDNaturopathic Treatment: Prevention Prevention is the best medicine! Find the cause ...vast majority of AOM is related to allergy, so find the allergen and treat it. If you stop the fluid from accumulating, the ears stay dry and there is less liklihood of getting AOM in the first place. Look at the patient's environment to identify triggers, including diet, home environment, school environment, family habits and hobbies. Giving Xylitol chewing gum at a dose of 8.4 -19 g per day has been shown to reduce the incidence of AOM in children attending day care. Otitis Media C&C Infections 2/4/18: Darin Ingels, NDNaturopathic Treatment: Active Infection 1.Mullein oil ear drops with garlic : warm bottle under warm water to heat oil. Place 2 drops in affected ear 3 times a day or as needed until ear pain subsides. Can add Hypericum to it for pain relief. 1.Vitamin A : give 10,000 to 50,000 IU bid -tid with food for up to 7 days. Vitamin A increases secretory IgA, which lines all of the mucous membranes and supports immune function. Research suggests children more prone to AOM are deficient in vitamin A and then vitamin A supplementation may help treat AOM. 1 1 Lasisi AO. The role of retinol in the etiology and outcome of suppurative otitis media. Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol. NDNaturopathic Treatment: Active Infection 3.Zinc: give 15 -50 mg daily with food . Research is mixed on preventing AOM and few studies on actively treating AOM with zinc supplementation. 3.Vitamin C : give 500 -1000 mg 3 times a day to help support immune function. Research shows that children with AOM tend to have low antioxidant stores, so giving antioxidants may help reduce incidence of AOM. Vitamin C also helps boost immune function. Ko\u00e7an EG, antioxidants in otitis media with effusion billion col/tab at night. Reduced AOM by almost 43%.1 This has also been developed as a nasal spray and shown to be effective. Other studies found conflicting results with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and LC705, Bifidobacterium breve 99 and did find rhamnosus GG when combined with Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12. 5.Essential oils : there is some anecdotal evidence that placing essential oils into the affected ear may help. These include thyme, eucalyptus and basil oils. Research has only been done on basil oil.2Essential oils should be mixed with a carrier oil to reduce irritation. 1DiPierro F, DiPasquale D, DiCicco M.

Although no specific human trials have been done on inhaled glutathione, it is postulated that using inhaled glutathione may reduce oxidative stress and protect against mucosal damage and modulate the immune response in the lungs.1 I have personally used inhaled glutathione with success in chronic bronchitis and asthma patients. Use 60 mg/ml daily in children up to 200 mg/ml in adults. 1 Allen J. Inhaled glutathione for the prevention of air pollution -related health effects: a brief review. Altern Ther Darin Ingels, NDNaturopathic : research shows that infants with chronic bronchitis have low serum and RBC magnesium levels, while urine magnesium excretion is high.1 Although it is unclear if the hypomagnesemia is causative of chronic bronchitis, supplementing is reasonable. Give 200 mg bid to children and TBT to adults. 1Bednarek A, Pasternak K, Karska M. Evaluation of blood serum, erythrocyte and urine magnesium concentrations in babies with pneumonia or bronchial obstructive bronchitis. Magnes Res. 2003 Sambucus has historical use for respiratory illnesses such as bronchitis, colds and flu. It has natural antiviral and antiinflamatory activity. It induces the release of infection - fighting cytokines. The antiinflamatory effects in the bronchioles make it useful for viral and bacterial infections of the lungs, including bronchioltitis, bronchitis, pneumonia and reactive airway disease. Give 1 tsp tid -qid for children and 1T tid an inducible antimicrobial peptide that is important in innate immunity. The result is an increase in NF -B, which control cellular immunity and cytokine production.1 One study found an extract of andrographis help reduce the duration of illness in uncomplicated URI by more than 2 days.2 Andrographis has known antiviral effects against HSV , influenza, campylobacter, skin yeast, Group B strep and other microbes. Because of its anti-inflammatory effects, it is used for other inflammatory conditions like RA and UC. Give 200 -500 mg qd -bid of a 5% standardized extract. 1Shao ZJ, Zheng XW, Feng T et al. Andrographolide exerted its antimicrobial effects by upregulation of human - defensin -2 induced through p38 MAPK and NF -B pathway in human lung epithelial J Physiol Pharmacol. 2012 May;90(5):647 -53. 2 Saxena RC, Singh R, Kumar P et al.

Pediatric Diarrhea C&C Infections 2/4/18: Darin Ingels, NDNeed to investigate cause of diarrhea as treatment varies depending on diagnosis. Most common causes of pediatric diarrhea include: Rotavirus Other enteric viruses, including enterovirus, adenovirus, poisoning (salmonella, shigella, campylobacter) IBS IBD Celiac disease Food 2/4/18: Ingels, NDNaturopathic Treatment: Diet Hydration: push fluids. Use electrolyte replacement formulas. Make into popsicles for small children and infants. B.R.A.T diet: keep diet simple and bland until diarrhea resolves. Bananas, applesauce, rice and toast (gluten -free). Avoid simple carbohydrates and junk food. This includes, milk, soda or juice of all kinds. Feed small, frequent meals if tolerated.

One study found that glutamine powder at 0.3g/kg/day helped shorten the duration of diarrhea by more than 24 hours.1 Glutamine dosing should be fairly high in acute diarrhea, so an 80 lb child would get 10g/day. Adults getting chemotherapy have received as high as 30g/day. 1Yal\u00e7in SS, Yurdak\u00f6k K, Tezcan I, Oner L.

One study is infants between 3- 21 months with acute diarrhea were given up to 15g/day of carob powder compared with placebo. The duration of diarrhea in those receiving carob powder was reduced by almost 2 days. Cessation of vomiting, weight loss and regulation of body temperature was also more quickly normalized in those taking carob powder. 1 1 Loeb H, Vandenplas Y, W\u00fcrsch P, Guesry P.

Giving 10 -20 mg/kg/day of zinc helped restore normal bowel habits in hospitalized children with diarrhea.1 The effect was even greater when 1500 IU of vitamin A per day was added to the treatment regimen. On a practical note, you must give zinc with food or it can make patient nauseous. Best to give in small doses with food. 1Wang Y, Gao Y, Liu Q, et al.

Nonetheless, vitamin D deficiency has been indicated in numerous chronic illnesses, including IBD and IBS. It is reasonable to supplement vitamin D, especially in those with low serum vitamin D. 1 Talachian E, Bidari A, Noorbakhsh S, Tabatabaei A, Salari F.

Sudden urgency for a stool with profuse, offensive - smelling stools. Explosive diarrhea. Large thirst for cold liquids. Arsenicum album: Main remedy for diarrhea caused by food poisoning or from viral diseases. The diarrhea is worse after eating or drinking, and is usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting, burning or cramping pains in the abdomen. Chilly. Thirsty, but sips fluids. Aloe socotrina : Accidental leaking of stool after passing gas. Have a lot of sputtering during its release. Stools is very mucousy and like Jell -O. Veratrum album : Profuse, painful diarrhea that is forcibly evacuated. Chilly people, but they crave ice and cold drinks. Profuse sweating with chills, with projectile vomiting. Chamomilla : Diarrhea, in children with extreme irritability during their illness. Green, foul smelling diarrhea. Wants to be carried. Calcarea carbonica: Most commonly given to infants. Pale, lethargic infants who sweat profusely on head. Desires eggs and indigestible things like chalk or dirt. Cinchona officinalis : Diarrhea with great bloating, indigestion, and general weakness. The symptoms are noticeably worse at night, in hot weather, and after nursing. * Adopted from Dana Ullman, MPH MRSA C&C Infections 2/4/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of MRSA: 1.Manuka honey : the hydrogen peroxide found in honey creates hydroxyl free radicals which inhibit growth of MRSA and also disrupt intact DNA. Studies also show in inhibits the growth of vancomycin -resistant enterococcus.1 The active ingredient in manuka honey is methylglyoxal (MG), a compound found in most types of honey, but usually only in small quantities. Medical grade Manuka honey has a higher concentration of methylglyoxal by up to 10X's more than regular honey. This is a very safe, effective treatment for MRSA, especially for lesions around a child's mouth. 1Brudzynski K, Lannigan R.

This suggests adding licorice to other antibiotic regimens may help improve the clinical outcome of the infection.1 Other mouse studies have demonstrated that using topical Glycyrrhiza is effective at reducing lesion size and inhibiting specific genes involved in bacterial reproduction.2 1Gaur R, Gupta VK, Singh P, et al.

There have only been a few clinical studies in humans comparing tea tree oil with mupirocin. While tea tree oil was effective in eradicating MRSA, it was not as effective as mupirocin.1 However, using a 4% tea tree oil nasal ointment and a 5% tea tree oil body wash compared with a 2% mupirocin nasal ointment and triclosan body wash seemed to be more effective than standard treatment.2 1Dryden MS, Dailly S, Crouch M.

Tea tree oil as an alternative topical decolonization agent for methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus. J Ingels, NDSIBO is due to an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine that is still largely misunderstood. The two most common predisposing factors to SIBO are lack of gastric acid or disruptions in small bowel motility. It is believed that SIBO arises from overgrowth of bacteria in the small bowel. However, which microbes are most to blame as obtaining small bowel flora is technically difficult, especially for anaerobes. Lactulose breath test is the most common method of diagnosing SIBO. Lactulose makes it to the distal jejunum, so covers the entire small bowel. Glucose can be used as substrate to identify more proximal SIBO. Small Intestine Bacterial 2/4/18: Darin Ingels, NDNaturopathic Treatment Diet No specific diet has ever been studied, but many healthcare providers recommend following FODMAPs diet. These are Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols. It is also advisable to have patients avoid gluten, casein and known food allergies/sensitivities. Encourage fluids as constipation likely makes SIBO worse. Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth C&C Infections 2/4/18: LBT were given either 200 mg Rifaximin tid or 2 caps of each herbal formula bid for 4 weeks. At the conclusion of the study, 46% of those taking the herbal formulas had a negative LBT compared with 34% of those taking Rifaximin.1 The authors did not publish the differences between the two herbal protocols, so it is unclear if one protocol is better than the other. 1Chedid V , Dhalla S, Clarke JO, et al. Herbal Therapy Is Equivalent to Rifaximin for the Treatment of Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth. Global Advances in Health and Medicine. 2014;3(3):16 -24. Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth C&C Infections 2/4/18: NDNaturopathic Treatment 2.Probiotics with small pilot study found giving probiotics (Bacillus coagulan ) with FOS in addition to minocycline for 6 months (15 days minocycline and 15 days probiotics) eliminated SIBO in 93% of cases compared with only 67% using minocycline alone. 1 1Khalighi AR, Khalighi MR, Behdani R, et al. Evaluating the efficacy of probiotic on treatment in patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) -A pilot study. The Indian Journal of Medical Research. 2014;140(5):604 -608. Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth Treatment 3.Probiotics without FOS: short -term probiotic use may be effective at eliminating SIBO in patients with chronic liver disease. A combination of given for 4 weeks helped reduce symptoms of SIBO, but had no effect on liver disease .1 1 Kwak DS, Jun DW, Seo JG, et al. Short -term probiotic therapy alleviates small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but does not improve intestinal permeability in chronic liver disease. Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2014 Dec;26(12):1353 -9. guar gum with 1200 mg of Rifaximin for 10 days was more effective in eradicating SIBO than by just giving Rifaximin alone, by 87% and 62%, respectively. 1 It is unknown whether guar gum by itself would provide any benefit. 1Furnari, M., Parodi, A., Gemignani, L., et al. Clinical trial: the combination of rifaximin with partially hydrolysed guar gum is more effective than rifaximin alone in eradicating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Alimentary Treatment 5.Digestive enzymes: There is no research on the use of digestive enzymes of HCL in the treatment of SIBO, but if we believe that part of the problem is the inability to break down food products and dysfunctional digestion and/or fermentation, digestive enzymes may help provide symptomatic relief. I recommend using digestive enzymes containing pancreatin and DPP-IV for those with gluten or casein intolerance. Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth C&C Infections Darin Ingels, NDNaturopathic Treatment When its not SIBO ... There is some new evidence that patients who have SIBO- like symptoms and have a negative hydrogen and methane breath test may suffer from sucralase deficiency. This was previously believed to be a geentically inheirited condition, but it may affect some individuals who do not necessarily carry the gene. You can test by doing a sucrose hydrogen breath test. Sucraid \u00ae is an enzyme developed to help those who have this deficiency. Clostridium difficile Infection C&C positive, anaerobic, spore forming and toxin producing (some strains) bacteria that can be infectious (fecal -oral route) or simply overgrow due to antibiotic use or other perturbations of the GI tract. 24% of HC workers had C. difficile spores on their hands after working with C. diff patients (0% for unexposed HC workers). http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24334792. About 60% young children carry C. diff asymptomatically. Only 3 -5% of healthy adults carry C. diff. Sensitivity of the EIA test for detection of C. diff toxin in stool is low (only about 50%), so the PCR test is replacing the EIA test. \u00a9Jeff Novack, PhD Clostridium difficile Infection C&C Infections 2/4/18: Darin Ingels, NDClostridia by themselves are generally harmless. The toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is what triggers symptoms. By aware that testing for the toxin can be difficult as the toxins (A and B) are heat labile and breakdown easily if not kept at a cool temperature once outside of the body. Stability of toxin at room temperature is only 4 hours and up to 72 hours if refrigerated. If you are going to have patient collect sample, make sure they refrigerate the sample immediately and take to lab on ice or cold pack to ensure the toxin remains intact if present. Clostridium difficile Infection C&C Infections 2/4/18: Darin Ingels, NDNaturopathic Treatment Diet One study found patients with CDI has low RBC levels of -3 Fatty acids and higher levels of RBC -6 fatty acids.1While this was not an interventional study, other research has shown that -3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory effects. Adding -3 FA's may help reduce inflammation associated with CDI. Avoid known food allergies/sensitivities/intolerances. 1Czepiel J, Gdula- Argasi ska J, Garlicki A. n -3 and n -6 Fatty Acid Changes in the Erythrocyte Treatment 1.Probiotics: Evidence suggests taking probiotics can help prevent and treat active CDI. While several strains have been studies, a 2011 review found that probiotics that contained Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacillusspecies were that probiotics reduced CDI by 66%.2 I have had good success using VSL#3\u00ae. It is delbrueckii subsp.Bulgaricus. Each capsule delivers 150 billion organisms. Give 2 -4 caps bid- tid with food. 1Na X, Kelly C. Ma SS, for the prevention of -associated diarrhea: a systematic review and meta Med. 2012 Dec 18;157(12):878 that FMT was more effective at resolving CDI than antibiotics alone. More than 80% of patients with CDI improved with FMT, whereas only 31% of those with CDI improved with antibiotic therapy.1 However, FMT continues to have difficulties with adverse events. AE's were significantly higher in those who received transplants through upper GI methods (43.6%), compared with those who received their transplant through lower GI methods (17.7%).2 1Drekonja D, Reich J, Gezahegn S, et al.

Systematic Review: Adverse Events of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation. Grivennikov S, -3-carbinol: A recent mouse study found that adding I3C to the diet helped reduce severity of CDI. The I3C appears to help upregulate Tregcells, other T cells and neutrophils without increasing inflamation.1 Although there are no human studies for CDI, I3C has been used in clinical trials for prevention of cancer, particularly breast cancer. 1 Julliard W, De Wolfe TJ, Fechner JH, Mezrich JD. Indole Ann Surg. 2016 Ingels, NDNaturopathic Treatment 4.Vitamin A: research suggests vitamin A has immune enhancing effects. It is known to help reduce some diarrhea, HIV , measles, malaria and other infections in preschool children.1 However, it is not clear by what mechanism it works. It is also know that children with higher fecal SIgA are less likely to develop CDI compared with those who have lower SIgA levels.2 It is reasonable to try using high -dose vitamin A therapy (50,000 IU - 200,000 IU) in CDI. Watch for vitamin A toxicity, including headaches, joint pain, muscle aches, fatigue and dry skin. 1 Villamor E, Fawzi WW. Effects of vitamin a supplementation on immune responses and correlation with clinical outcomes. Clin Microbiol Rev. 2005 Jul;18(3):446 -64. 2Bridgman SL, Konya T, Azad MB, et al. High fecal IgA is associated with reduced Clostridium difficile colonization in infants . Microbes Treatment 5.Vitamin D: vitamin D deficiency has been associated with CDI. People with lower vitamin D (25 -OH) levels were 60% more likely to develop CDI than those with sufficient vitamin D levels.1 Vitamin D also has a protective effect on the intestinal barrier and may help reduce intestinal permeability. 2 Give enough vitamin D3 to restore serum levels to sufficient status (> 30 ng/ml). I try to get levels between 60 -100 ng/ml. 1 Furuya -Kanamori L, Wangdi K, Yakob Mastronardi M, Jirillo E, Chieppa M. Nutritional Keys for Intestinal Barrier Modulation.

McCann, MD Kelly K. McCann, MDInflammatory disease processes appear to be due to alterations in the microbiome. Autoimmune diseases may be antibody generation against polymicrobial colonies and infections. Intracellular microbes slow innate immune system defense by dysregulating the vitamin D nuclear receptor (VDR). VDR affects transcription of at least 913 gene including the expression of key antimicrobial peptides. This dysregulation facilitates the ability of other pathogens to persist and slow the immune system further. VDR dysregulation prevents the breakdown of the active VitD metabolite 1,25oh, thus it becomes elevated and 25 -OH vitD remains low. Elevated 1,25OH -D can interfere with the expression of other nuclear receptors such as the androgen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor and thyroid receptors. Vitamin D discrepancy Proal. 2009.

An infection can trigger an individual with an underlying immune dysregulation to express an overt autoimmune disease. 4. Infectious agents can determine the presence of disease -specific auto -antibodies and clinical manifestations. 5. In many cases, it is not a single infection, but rather the 'burden of infections' during life that is responsible for induction of autoimmunity. Kelly K. McCann, MDTen principles of the relationship between infection and autoimmunity 6. Infections during childhood can be implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases in adulthood.7. Infections can protect individuals from some autoimmune diseases. 8. The same infectious agent can induce one specific autoimmune disease and protect from another autoimmune disease.9. Molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, bystander activation and polyclonal activation can induce autoimmunity after infections via innate and adaptive immune responses.10. Genetic susceptibility might explain why only a subgroup of individuals will develop autoimmunity after infections. Kelly K.

McCann, MD Tryptophan metabolism -Lyme and serotonin Kelly K. McCann, MD IDO is induced by interferon (IFN) , interleukin -6 and tumor necrosis factor -, lipopolysaccharides and oxidative stress, factors that play a role in the pathophysiology of depression. TRYCATs, like kynurenine and quinolinic dysfunctions; and may lead to neurodegeneration. Tryptophan metabolism -Lyme and serotonin Kelly K. McCann, MD Certain strains of B. burgdorferi induce IDO as a mechanism to evade the immune system and promote dissemination of the infection. Cytokines stimulate release of neopterin and induce IDO to degrade tryptophan. Increased concentrations of neopterin and l-kynurenine have been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis and Lyme encephalopathy.

McCann, MD Kelly K. McCann, MDHow to manage a patient whom you suspect has Lyme disease Patients often need a team approach to their care. Locate and meet with Lyme literate practitioners in your area. Check out www.ILADS.org or your state or local Lyme advocacy groups for referrals. Begin the work up, if comfortable. If not, refer. You may also need functional and integrative medicine practitioners with whom to partner, if you can't find a Lyme literate, functional practitioner. Know that these patients have often been neglected and dismissed by the medical system. They need your support and acknowledgment that you believe them, even if you can't explain all their symptoms. If the psychological and emotional and even spiritual aspects don't get addressed, they will continue to struggle. Metaphor of immune system -boundary issues Kelly K. McCann, MD Kelly K.
