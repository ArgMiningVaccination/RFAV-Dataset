Dr. Eingorn is a chiropractor who believes in providing his patients with comprehensive care that addresses both the mind and body. The concept of connecting mind and body in a single therapy is an old one, and one that centers around the belief that both are inextricably connected to form one whole. Essentially, [Alex Eingorn D.C.](https://betterhealthchiropracticpc.com/alex-m-eingorn-dc/) believes that physical illness can be caused and compounded by not just the physical body, but also the mind as well. In other words, caring for the mind is just as important to overall health. This form of therapy Dr. Eingorn offers revolves around techniques that are used in order to help the individual attain both happiness and improved physical health. There are several tenets of this philosophy and therapy that Dr. Alex Eingorn teaches his patients. The most important of these are the following: 1. The body and mind are parts of a single system. In fact, doctors have successfully isolated a neuropeptide that has been linked to the carrying of emotion and information throughout the body. It is these molecules that are responsible for creating attraction, beliefs, and feelings. 2. The heart is the means by which we combat a disease. Dr. Eingorn believes that it is our spirit and passion that drives our health and that illness and health are not external issues, but are deeply connected to our humanity. 3. Deep psychological pain can be manifested in physical illness. 4. Therapy that incorporates feelings can heal this pain. The mind-body practices offered by Dr. Eingorn are designed to tap into and better understand those hurts and pains that have been plaguing us, whether they be two days or twenty years old. These issues don't just dissipate as we age. In fact, holding on to them for an extended period of time is what Dr. Eingorn believes can cause a myriad of unwanted physical side effects.
