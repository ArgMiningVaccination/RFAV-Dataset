Your baby's first vaccines give them the best protection against serious, infectious diseases. Vaccinating your baby on time is a simple, safe and effective way to protect them against diseases like meningitis, measles and polio. Vaccination also helps to stop these diseases from spreading and outbreaks occurring. Why it is important to not delay your baby's vaccines There have been more cases reported in Europe so far this year than were reported in the whole of 2022. Many children in Europe are not up to date with their MMR vaccines. [In Ireland vaccine uptake rates of the first and second doses of the MMR vaccine](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vaccinepreventable/vaccination/immunisationuptakestatistics/) have dropped below the 95% rate that is recommended by the WHO to stop measles from spreading. Babies are most at risk of infectious diseases when they are very small. Keeping up to date with your baby's vaccines and getting them vaccinated on time helps keep your baby healthy and well. Delaying the vaccines on the other hand can leave your baby vulnerable to certain diseases. Watch the video below from Caroline Carpenter, Assistant Director of Nursing in HSE Public Health Area A on why it is important to get your baby vaccinated. How do vaccines work? When your child is given a vaccine, their body responds by making antibodies, in the same way as if they had caught the disease but without getting sick. The antibodies that your child's body makes then stay in their body to protect them against the actual disease. How long do vaccines take to work? It usually takes a few weeks for vaccines to work, so your child will not be protected immediately. What happens next? The HSE will write to remind you to visit your GP (family doctor) for your baby's first vaccines. If you do not get a letter from the HSE, you should arrange to visit your GP practice when your child is two months old. It takes just five visits to your General Practice (family doctor) to complete your baby's vaccination schedule, giving your baby the best protection from these vaccine preventable diseases. These vaccines are free. For more information you can [download the information booklet - Your Child's Immunisation - a Guide for Parents](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/pcischedule/engyourchildsimm.pdf) - to learn more about your child's vaccines. What happens before my baby's vaccine appointment? Before your baby gets vaccinated, your GP or practice nurse will check with you that your baby is well and able to get the vaccines. If you have any questions about the vaccines recommended for your baby, you can ask your GP or practice nurse before your baby gets vaccinated. You can also get more information from the public health nurse at your local HSE health clinic. Should I give my baby anything before their vaccine appointment? You can give your baby milk (unless they are allergic to it) a few minutes before their vaccine appointment. This will help reduce pain. At the 2 and 4 month vaccine visits, your baby will get rotavirus oral vaccine. You can feed your baby at any time before or after this vaccine. How are the vaccines given? The rotavirus vaccine is given as a liquid dropped into your baby's mouth and the other vaccines are given as injections into your baby's legs. What should I do if my baby did not get some of their recommended vaccines? Parents may not have been able to bring their baby for vaccination on time. If you are delayed with your baby's vaccines, you can get right back on track with your baby's vaccine schedule by contacting your General Practice (family doctor) to arrange an appointment. It's good to have questions about vaccines but you should always get information from people you can trust like the [HSE National Immunisation Office website](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/) or have a conversation with your Practice Nurse or GP. They will be more than happy to talk to you about vaccines and your baby. What common reactions can my child get after being vaccinated? Common reactions after the 2 and 4 month vaccines (visits 1 and 2) include: - Fever after the MenB vaccine - Soreness, swelling and redness in the area where the injection was given - Mild diarrhoea after the rotavirus oral vaccine Before your baby's first vaccines you should buy some liquid infant paracetamol. This will reduce the fever after their MenB vaccines at 2 and 4 months. Common reactions after the 6, 12 and 13 month vaccines (visits 3, 4 and 5) include: - Soreness, swelling and redness in the area where the injection was given - Fever - Headache or irritability For more information on these common reactions and what to do when they occur, please [read the Your Child's Immunisation - a Guide for Parents booklet](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/pcischedule/engyourchildsimm.pdf) or [read the post vaccination advice leaflet](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/pcischedule/postimmtp.pdf) available on the National Immunisation Office website. If your baby is very unwell after getting a vaccine, they may be sick for some other reason. If you are worried about your baby, please contact your GP (family doctor), practice nurse or public health nurse for further advice. 5 tips from a General Practice Nurse to remember when getting your baby vaccinated How parents and guardians can keep track of their baby's vaccine schedule and what to expect before and after their baby gets vaccinated. - Your baby needs 5 visits to their GP practice to be fully vaccinated.
