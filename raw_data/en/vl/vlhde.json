Summary of Remedial Design Investigation Sampling and Analysis Program Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 1 1 Introduction EnviroAnalytics Group (EAG) has prepared the following Work Plan to complete a Phase II Site Investigation and a Remedial Design Investigation on a portion of the Sparrows Point Terminal, LLC property where the Rod and Wire Mill was once located. This portion of the site is approximately 67 acres and has been designated as Area A, Parcel A -3, as shown on Figure 1 (Site) . This Phase II Site Investigation and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan provides for the collection of 1) Phase II Investigation data for the Rod and Wire Mill Area to support characterization of current soil and groundwater conditions in conjunction with environmental responses for the site consis tent with the Maryland Voluntary Cleanup Program Phase II investigative process and 2) data necessary to evaluate potential corrective measures for the Rod and Wire Mill Area. The intent of the data collection activities is to provide additional soil and g roundwater data and proof -of-concept information to support corrective measures work that will ultimately result a final remedy for the Rod and Wire Mill Area that complies with the requirement s of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Maryland Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP). The remainder of this introduction provides a brief description of the Site, a discussion of the regulatory authority for the environmental responses at the Site, a review of the basis for the scope of work specified in this work plan, a description of the existing IM, and an outline for the remainder of the work plan. 1.1 Site Description From the late 1800 's until 2012, the production and manufacturing of steel was conducted at Sparrows Point. Iron and steel production operations and processes at Sparrows Point included raw material handling, coke production, sinter production, iron production, steel production, and semi -finished and finished product preparation. In 1970, Sparrows Point was the largest steel facility in the United States, producing hot and cold rolled sheets, coated materials, pipes, plates, and rod and wire. The steelmaking operations at the Facility ceased in fall 2012. The Rod and Wire Mill Area is located in the northwestern portion of the Site, and is the location of the former mills that produced rods and wire products from the 1940's to the early 1980's. The area is bounded to the west by Riverside Drive and Bear Creek, to the north by Bethlehem Boulevard and Interstate 695, and to t he east by the former Pipe Mill Area , which is currently being investigated as Parcel A-1. All manufacturing activities at the Rod and Wire Mill Area ceased operation in the early 1980's with subsequent demolition of all structures between 1994 and 2000, based on historical aerial photos. Current ground cover includes s lag aggregate that was placed in conjunction with the Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 2 demolition program. The Rod and Wire Mill Area includes approximately 67 acres of the Site located as shown on Figure 1 . Manufact uring activities at the Rod and Wire Mill included leaching of zinc ore and a subsequent treatment process to remove cadmium impurities. These activities resulted in zinc and cadmium contaminated soil and groundwater. The leaching process was implemented in large tanks located inside the north end of the former Rod and Wire Mill building. In the 1950's through the early 1970 's, the acidic leach residue was stored in the Northwest Pond until about 1959 when filters were installed to dewater the residues. Dewater ed sludge generated from this process was temporarily stored on the ground outside the north end of the mill in the Former Sludge Bin Storage Area as shown on Figure 2 . Filtrate from the dewatering process was recycled to the wire plating process. Excess filtrate was discharged to the East Pond until 1971, after which it was sent to the HCWWTP for treatment. These operations ended in the early 1980's when the Rod and Wire M ill was shut down. Locations of former mill operations are shown in plan view on Figure 2 . Historically, as part of a series of site investigations conducted by the then owner, Bethlehem Steel Corporation, there were various Solid Waste Management Units (SWMUs) identified in the vicinity of the Rod and Wire Mill area during th e mid -1980s and on through the early 1990s. Specifically, there were 8 SWMUs identified in the January 1998 \"Description of Current Conditions Report - Bethlehem Steel Corporation - Sparrows Point\" report (DCC report), Section 3.3.4, prepared by Rust SWMU 29: East SWMU 38: Cadmium Treatment Trenches SWMU 39: Rod Mill Scale Pits (2) SWMU 44: Rod Mill Cooling Tower SWMU 45: Rod Mill Trenches/Su mps Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 3 As part of the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment conducted by Weaver Boos Consultants, LLC, in May 2014, the SWMUs were updated from the DCC report; there were six Recognized Environmental Conditions (RECs) identified in the Rod and Wire Mill Area as still requiring further investigation for a permanent remediation measure. The location of the RECs are shown on Figure 3 and further described as follows: New REC Former SMWU /AOC Area Name Explanation 6A 27 Rod Mill Remediation Area Continuing interim measures (IM) are in place for cadmium/zinc impacted groundwater as per the Consent Decree. During the site visit the existing IM remediation system was observed. Based on this information, the potential for a material release which may impact the environment is present. 6B 28 [Filled] Northwest Pond Continuing interim measures are in place for cadmium/zinc impacted groundwater as per the Consent Decree. During the site visit the existing IM remediation system was observed. Based on our review of historical source information and experience, the Northwest Pond may have potentially contained hazardous substances and/or petroleum products which may have resulted in a release to the environment. 6C 29 [Filled] East Pond Continuing interim measures are in place for cadmium/zinc impacted groundwater as per the Consent Decree. During the site visit the existing IM remediation system was observed. Based on this information, the potential for a material release which may impact the environment is present. 6D 45 Rod Mill Trenches/Sumps The DCC Report recommended further action was needed for this item which were identified as piping designed to transport process wastewater. Based on our review of historical source information and expe rience, the trenches/sumps may have potentially contained hazardous substances and/or petroleum products which may have resulted in a release to the environment. 6E X Unknown Aboveground Tank The DCC Report recommended further action was needed for this item. Based on our review of historical source information and experience, the tank may have contained hazardous substances and/or petroleum products which may have resulted in a release to the environment. 1.2 Regulatory Authority Environmental responses for the former Rod and Wire Mill Area and for the Site in general, are being implemented pursuant to the following: Multimedia Consent Decree between Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and the Maryland Departm ent of the Environment (effective October 8, 1997); this Consent Decree has been modified in accordance with a stipulated order entered into by Sparrows Point LLC and the respective agencies effective July 28, 2014 Administrative Consent Order (ACO) betwee n Sparrows Point Terminal, LLC and the Maryland Department of the Environment (effective September 12, 2014); Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 4 Settlement Agreement and Covenant Not to Sue (SA) between Sparrows Point Terminal, LLC and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (effe ctive November 25, 2014). The Rod and Wire Mill Area has been included in Area A for the Site and has been designated for investigation, remediation, and/or development on a priority basis as defined in the ACO. To delineate Area A in accordance with th e ACO, Sparrows Point Terminal, LLC submitted a VCP application for Area A on September 10, 2014. The Multi -Media Consent Decree (Decree) for the Sparrows Point facility dealt with many issues associated with ongoing iron -making, steel -making, coking, byp roduct, plating, and finishing operations. To the extent that these operation s are no longer conducted, and the associated facilities no longer exist, many specific requirements of the Decree are no longer applicable and have been removed in accordance wi th the stipulated order implementing modifications to the Decree . The aforementioned ACO and SA incorporate the relevant aspects of the Decree by reference. 1.3 Work Plan Basis Regulatory obligations for investigation, remediation, pathway exclusion, and cl osure of applicable areas of the Site are addressed within the ACO and EPA Agreement. Regulatory obligations and closure will be conducted in accordance with the terms of the Regulatory Agreements, which include obtaining a No Further Action letter and Certificate of Completion under MDE's Voluntary Cleanup Program and an EPA Certificate of Completeness after the BSC Consent Decree Areas proceed through RCRA's Statement of Basis process upon which a Final Decision and Response to Documents is rendered. This work plan has also been developed in view of the conceptual approach for site cleanup as specified in a Site Conceptual Cleanup Plan (SCCP) dated August 29, 2014. Furthermore, a project scoping meeting was held with the USEPA and MDE on November 19, 2014. Comments, observations, and suggestions offered by USEPA and MDE representatives during the project scoping meeting have been considered and incorporated during preparation of this work plan. Contaminants of concern include primarily cadmium and z inc affecting surface soil, subsurface soil, and groundwater. The primary exposu re pathways for the Rod and Wire Mill A rea include potential exposure to surface soil and the potential discharge of groundwater to surface water of Bear Creek. Groundwater f low is currently being controlled by the operation of the Interim Measure IM system that is more fully described in the following section. This IM system has reversed the natural groundwater flow direction away from Bear Creek through the use of recovery wells. Groundwater, when the pump and treat system is not operatin g, has been shown to flow west-southwesterly across the im pacted areas towards Bear Cre ek adja cent to the former Rod and Wire Mill. Potential r isks may be present for this exposure pathway from direct toxicity of dissol ved meta ls to bent hic organisms, accum ulation in food webs, surface water aquatic li fe, and human health. Response action s will be implemented to mitigate this exposure and u tilize groundwater compliance concentrat ions der ived from risk as sessment w ork to Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 5 be completed based in part on su rface water q uality standards (WQS) for cadmium and zinc. Corrective actions will be completed to control sources and mitigate impacts and eliminate the requirement to operate and maintain ex isting interim measures (i.e. the pump and treat system). Remediation will focus on the mitigation of future exposure pathways from contaminated s oil and groundwater as follows: Soil Prevent potential future direct exposure to contaminated surface soil Mitigate future leaching to groundwater Groundwater Mitigate potential for non -point source discharge of groundwater above acceptable risk -based concentrations and eliminate need for ongoing interim measure currently consisting of pumping and treatment of groundwater in this area . 1.4 Description of Interim Measures Historical operations in the Rod and Wire Mill Area resulted in releases of cadmium and zinc to soil and groundwater. In 1986, a soil and groundwater remediation program was initiated to address groundwater exhibiting elevated levels of cadmium and zinc, and residual soil contamination in the Sludge Bin Storage Area. Remediation initially consisted of a soil-flushing program and associated pumping and treatment of gr oundwater from shallow and int ermediate wells . The groundwater pumping was discontinued and the treatment plant dismantled in 1999 to support a demolition project at the Rod and Wire Mill allowing for reassessment of the interim measure. BSC submitted a Work Plan to re -establish Inte rim Measures in July 2000; the Work Plan was approved by the Agencies in November 2000. Re -establishment of the Interim Measure included an institutional control for soil, upgrades to the monitoring well network, construction of two recovery wells, instal lation of a transmission pipeline to the HCWWTP , and evaluation of pump test data, groundwater flow characteristics, and review of the system's effectiveness. The pumping and treatment of groundwater resumed in September 2001 and currently continues. At present, known dissolved cadmium and zinc plumes exist in the sandy subsurface from approximately 20 to 30 feet below ground surface (bgs). The average depth to water is approximately 3 to 5 feet bgs, and the sandy substrate exists down to approximately 50 to 60 feet bgs. There is currently no indication that significant dissolved phase concentrations are deeper than 30 ft. bgs. Interim Measures (IMs) are currently underway at the former Rod and Wire Mill Area as described below: Institutional controls for soils have been established to provide a \"Restricted Work Area\" to control the exposure of onsite workers to soils in the Former Sludge Bin Storage Area. Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 6 A groundwater monitoring network has been installed including the use of 31 wells for monitoring the performance of the groundwater pump and treat system. This monitoring network is used to collect water level and groundwater quality data. A groundwater pump and treat system is operated and maintained consisting of two intermediate depth zone recover y wells (RW10 -PZM020 and RW15 -PZM020) that operate at a rate of between 5.0 and 12.0 gallons per minute (gpm). The expected normal operating rate for the treatment plant was set at a combined rate of 8.0 to 12.0 gpm with a maximum design flow of 25 gpm. Recovered groundwater is transported via a pipeline to the Humphreys Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant (HCWWTP) for subsequent treatment and discharge in accordance with the NPDES permit requirements for the Facility. The 2013 and 2014 system operation st ats are as follows: 2013 2014 Annual Avg Total Mass Removed, Cd 113 lbs 216 lbs Total Mass Removed, Zn 3646 lbs 11,090 lbs The increase in mass remov al of cadmium and zinc in 2014 as compared to 2013 is due to the increase in the volume of water pumped from both wells in 2014 . 1.5 Work Plan Outline This document provides a plan for data collection efforts to further delineate the known source areas for cadmium and zinc impacts, investigate the presence of other potential contaminants, collect water quality data, and complete a hydraulic study with and without pumping conditions. Characterization of the area is required to support design planning for eff orts to remediate the existing contamination posing a risk to human health and/or the environment. In addition, and to that end, this document also provides planned work that will include bench scale studies and treatability studies being considered for the purpose of evaluating various remedial options which might be applied at the Rod and Wire Mill Area. Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 7 2 Work Plan Objectives The objectives of the Phase II and Pre -Design investigation consist o f: Provide an overall investig ation of the Rod and Wire Mil l Area , and parti cularly the identi fied RECS, sufficient to meet the site characterization require ments of the Marylan d VCP; Provide a focused inve stigation to characterize the nature and extent of conta minati on in the Rod & Wire Area to support risk asse ssment and an evaluation of r emedial options for this area of known contamination. The former operations in the Rod and Wire Mill Area represent potential releases to the environ ment. The objective of the Phase II investi gation of these areas is to deter mine presence or abse nce of releases associated with identi fied RECs and former operations areas . In addition , it is planned to provide reasonable spatial coverage of samples scree ning the remainder of the former Rod and Wire Mill Area for potential conta mination. The Rod & Wire Area is the site of an on-going Interim Measure. The objectiv e of the Pre-Design investigation is to provide sufficient data to allow for assessment and development of remedial objectives, and to adequately define the nature and e xtent of the known contamination to support the evaluation of potential remedial measures to develop a final Response Action Plan (RAP) that could eliminate the need for the on -going Interim Meas ure. Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 8 3 Scope of Work The scope of work for the form er Rod and Wire Mill Area as presented herein is supplemented by additional project planning documents. Specifically, a task -specific Health and Safety Plan (HASP) and a Site Wide Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) have been prepared for the scope of work. The HASP complies with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulation 1910.120. All field personnel assigned for work at the Site have been trained in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrati on (OSHA) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response standard (29 CFR 1910.120) and other applicable OSHA training standards. All field staff will be experienced in hazardous waste site work, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and emergenc y response procedures. 3.1 Phase II Site Investigation Several areas in and around the buildings and facilities in the former Rod and Wire Mill area may have been historical sources of environmental contamination. These areas were identified as targets for sampling through a careful review of historical documents. When a sampling target was identified, a boring was placed at or next to its location using GIS software (ArcMap Version 10.3 ). The first sampling targets to be identified were Recognized Environ mental Conditions (RECs) located within the Site boundaries, as shown on the REC Location Map provided in the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) prepared by Weaver Boos Consultants dated May 19, 2014 . The following RECs were identified: Rod Mill Remediation Area (REC 6A and SWMU 27), Northwest Pond (REC 6B and SWMU 28), East Pond (REC 6C and SWMU 29), Rod Mill Trenches/Sumps (REC 6D and SWMU 45) and Unknown Aboveground Storage Tank (REC 6E and AOC X) . Additional Findings (non -RECs) from the Phase I ESA which were identified as Potential Environmental Concerns were also reviewed and targeted as applicable. Following the identification and evaluation of all RECs at the Site, SWMUs and Areas of Concern (AOCs) were identified from the DCC r eport. Additional Findings, SWMUs and AOCs that were identified include: Rod Mill Remediation Area (REC 6A and SWMU 27), Northwest Pond (REC 6B and SWMU 28), East Pond (REC 6C and SWMU 29), Rod Mill Trenches/Sumps (REC 6D and SWMU 45) and Unknown Abovegro und Storage Tank (REC 6E and AOC X) . Following the identifica tion of all SWMUs and AOCs, three (3 ) sets of historical site drawings were reviewed to identify additional sampling targets. These site drawings included the 5000 Set (Plant Arrangemen t), the 5100 Set (Plant Index) and the 5500 Set (Plant Sewer Lines) . Sampling target locations were identified if the historical site drawings depicted industrial activities or a specific feature at a location that may have been a source of environmental contami nation that impacted the Site. Based on this criterion, sampling targets identified at the Site include: paint room, oil storage areas, truck repair areas, various pits, furnaces, cooling towers, water treatment areas, acid tanks, dye room, compressor roo ms, pump houses, bearing shop, millwright shop, roll shop, maintenance shop, fuel Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 9 storage, electroplating area, lead room, leach plant, galvanizing line, battery storage area, rail activities, stelmor lines and bethanizing plant . The number of proposed b orings that targeted a specific feature is directly related to the size and likely historical presence of materials that could have impacted the Site. The full list of sampling targets, along with the specific rationale fo r each point , is provide d in Table 1. Once all sampling targets were identified, additional samples locations were added to fill in areas with insufficient coverage (large spatial gaps between proposed borings) within the Site. The density of soil borings was maintained above th e requirements set forth in Worksheet 17 - Samp ling Design and Rational e. Excluding the electric sub -station (<3 acres) in the northeast corner of the site, Parcel A 3 contained approximately 59 .1 acres without engineered barriers, and 5.2 acres with engin eered barriers (roads /parking). In accordance with the relevant sampling density requirements, a minimum of 30 soil bores were required in the area without engineered barriers, and a minimum of 3 soil bores were required in the parking sections (or 5 soil bores including the sub -station) . Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the proposed borings and the Site boundary overlain on the relevant figures and drawings from the historical documents. Figure 5 shows the proposed locations for all groundwater sampling. The p roposed locations for soil and groundwater sampling are shown on Figure 2 and Figure 5 . Table 1 contains specific details on each sampling location, the proposed sample intervals and media, sampling methods, various parameters and analyses planned per loc ation, and the purpose/rationale for the sampling at each location. The Phase II Investigation scope of work has been designed to include the following tasks : Provide an overall investigation of the former Rod and Wire Mill Area Meet site characterizat ion requirements of the Administrative Consent Order Investigate specific identified REC s Investigate Potential Environmental Concerns associated with former operations Provide overall area coverage Assess the presence or absence of significant impacts in soil and groundwater Include 61 test borings o Surface s oil and intermediate soil horizon sampling intervals o TCL (Target Compound List) -VOCs, TCL-SVOCs, TAL (Target Analyte List) Metals , Cobalt, Cyanide, Oil and Grease (O&G) Hexavalent Chromium and P CBs (surface soil only) for soil o Shallow groundwater samples will be collected at 10 boring locations o TCL-VOCs, TCL-SVOCs, TAL Metals , Cobalt, Cyanide , O&G and Hexavalent Chromium for groundwater Sampling and analysis of ten existing shallow and interm ediate groundwater mo nitoring wells (TCL-VOCs, and Hexavalent Chromium ) 3.1.1 Sampling Plan This Work Plan presents the methods and protocols to be used to complete the site characterization. These methods and p rocedures follow the MDE -VCP guidelines. Information regarding the project organization, field activities and sampling methods, sampling equipment, sample handling and management procedures, the laboratory analytical methods and selected laboratory, quali ty control and Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 10 quality assurance procedures, investigation -derived waste (IDW) management methods, reporting requirements are described in detail in the Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) that has been developed to support the investigation and remediat ion of the Sparrows Point Terminal Site (Sparrows Point Terminal Quality Assurance Project Plan -Revision 2, ARM Group Inc. , September 2015 ). The proposed schedule of this investigation is contained in this work plan , Section 6 . All site characteri zation activities will be conducted under the site -specific health and safety plan (HASP); which is provided as Appendix A . 3.1.2 Soil Borings Soil samples will be collected according to procedures referenced in the Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) Worksh eet 21\u2014Field SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) and Appendix A of the QAPP . Regarding soil sampling depth, a shallow sample will be collected from the 0 to 1 foot depth interval, and a deeper sample be collected from the 4 to 5 foot depth interval. One additional set of samples will also be collected from the 9 to 10 foot depth interval; if groundwater has not been encountered however, these samples will be held by the laboratory pending the analysis of the 0 to 1 and 4 to 5 foot depth interval samples. If the PID or other field observations indicate contamination to exist at a depth greater than 5 feet bgs but less than 9 feet bgs, and is above the water table, the sample from the deeper 4 -5 foot interval may be shifted to the depth interval indicated b y the PID response. It should be noted that no soil samples will be collected from a depth that is below the water table. RW-071-SB through RW -075-SB will only include manually collected shallow soil sampl es, due to accessibility concerns for utility loca ting and boring equipment . After soil sampling has been concluded at a location, all down -hole soil sampling equipment will be decontaminated according to procedures referenced in the QAPP Worksheet 21 \u2014Field SOPs and Appendix A of the QAPP , SOP No. 16 - Equipment Decontamination. The decontamination procedures that will be used during the course of this investigation include Decontamination Area (Section 3.1 of the SOP) , Decontamination of Sampling Equipment (Section 3.5), Decontamination of Groundwater Sampling Pumps (Section 3.6), Decontamination of Measurement Devices & Monitoring Equipment (Section 3.7), Decontamination of Subsurface Drilling Equipment (Section 3.8) , and Document and Record Keeping (Section 5) . All soil samples will be analyzed for TCL-VOCs, TCL-SVOCs, TAL Metals, cobalt, hexavalent chromium, oil & grease , and cyanide. Additionally, the shallow soil samples collected across the Site from the 0 -1 foot bgs interval will also be analyzed for PCBs. Soil samp les that are collected in association with the oil storage area, truck repair shop, maintenance shop, roll shop, fuel shop and oil room will also be analyzed for TPH -GRO and TPH -DRO.

These areas are generally characterized as follows: Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 14 The Former Sludge Bin Storage Area is locat ed to the west of the former east pond, and was used to store bins of zinc-proce ssing sludges. Based on the anticipate d soil conta mination in this area, a soil flushing program was initiated, along with the installati on of a groundwater recovery and treat ment system. The soil flushing program was halted when the area was razed, and then the current IM was instituted . The Former East Pond is located in the nort heaster n portion of the Former Rod and Wire Mill and historically received excess filtrate from the dewatering of zinc processing sludges. Currently, the area consists mainly of a narrow, heavily vegetated band of Phragmi tes with interspersed poison ivy. A portion of the Former East Pond is sparsely vegetated and consists of fine-grained soil. This area is surrounded by paved and unpaved roads and is partially covered by a BGE substation. An ecological risk characterizatio n of the direc t contac t and food chain exposures identified the following COPCs in surfac e soils: bariu m, lead , zinc, cadmium, and vanadiu m (Final Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment for On - Site Areas (BERA ) Report, URS 2011 ). Fourteen b orings are planned to be drilled in the Former Sludge Bin Storage Area and the Former East Pond areas to provide additional data to assess the nature and extent of the potential source areas at the locations identified on Figure 4. Depending on site conditions, the borings will be advanced utilizing Geoprobe drilling meth ods. Discrete soil samples will be recovered at approximately 5 foot intervals from the ground surface to 35 feet bgs. Additio nal samples will also be collected of any obvi ous source area materials or soils suspected of containing the highest co ntaminant conce ntrations for the various treatability tests . Field portable XRF instruments are being considered for use during field investigations to provide real - time results for TAL metals in soils. Results from XRF tests will be used to guide the investigation and select samples for subsequent laboratory analyses. Laboratory analyses , in accordance with Table 2 , will be performed on the soil and groundwater samples recovered to provide additional definition of the source areas at the Rod and Wire Mill. T he following analytical methods are proposed to be used : TAL Metals via USEPA Method 6020, Free organic carbon analysis, and Grain size ana lysis. Additional characterization analyses may be performed including: groundwa ter, Toxicit y Characteristi c Leachin g Procedur e (TCLP) testing t o asses s on-site landfillin g options , and Total organi c carbon , pH, and phosphat e testin g to support fat e and transpor t and chemical stabilizatio n evaluations . Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 15 Groundwater will be recovered from source area Borings RW-057-SB, RW -063-SB, RW -067-SB and RW analyzed for the following characterization and treatability parameters : Total Organic Carbon (TOC) , Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Sulfide, pH, ORP, TAL metals, Ferrous iron, Dissolved Oxygen, Sulfate, Nitrate (as N), and Alkalinity (as CaCO3). 3.2.2 Groundwater Flow Modeling Groundwater modeling at the former Rod and Wire Mill Area will be completed in two phases: Phase 1 ) Initial Groundwater Modeling, and Phase 2 ) Specific Design Modeling for Selected Remedy . Phase 1 modeling will be completed now as part of the work effort planned as part of the Pre -Design Investigation; Phase 2 modeling will follow and be integrated as part of remedial design work plans . The purpose of the Phase 1 modeling will be to develop a model that can be used to screen and evaluate potential options for the final remedial approach, to assist in developing a 60% design of the selected remedy, and to identify additional data requ irements for the final remedial design. The purpose of the Phase 2 model will be to assist in the design, construction, and justification of the final remedy and will be a more in depth detailed modeling approach. The Phase 2 modeling will also be used to develop a performance monitoring plan for the final remedy. Objectives of Phase 1 Groundwater Model The objectives of the Phase 1 model will be: to establish a numerical groundwater flow model based on the U.S. Geological Survey's SEAWAT , or equival ent that incorporates o the surrounding surface water, o the shallow, intermediate, and deep aquifer system, Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 16 o the influence of the existing pumping system (RW15 and RW10) , and o prediction / control of cadmium and zinc migration, primarily in the intermediate zone (based on flow, not transport) , and to screen and evaluate potential options for the final remedial approach, to assist in developing a 60% design of the selected remedy, and to identify additional data requirements for the final remedial design. Data Requirements for the Phase 1 Groundwater Modeling The Phase 1 groundwater modeling will incorporate the existing site hydrogeologic and geologic information. The model will be calibrated using historic groundwater levels in the available monitoring wells in all hydrostratigraphic units. Tidal influences, if applicable, will also be used as a model calibration parameter. Hydraulic Conductivity Testing Single well aquifer testing (slug testing) is proposed for existing monitoring wells completed in th e shallow, intermediate, and deeper water bearing zones at the site. In addition, an aquifer test using the existing pumping wells RW10 and RW15 is proposed with additional nested piezometers installed in the shallow, intermediate, and deep zones. Aquife r Testing Three monitoring wells are proposed to be installed in support of data collection requirements for the groundwater model. Specifics are as follows: RW2 4-PZM => located 50 f eet from RW -10 in a northwesterly direction towards RW07 - intermediate zone The rationale for this monitoring well will be to monitor drawdown from pumping well RW10 during both drawdown and recovery phases of the test. Anticipated drawdown could be on the order to 1 foot or potentially less based on the pumping rate of RW10. RW2 3-PZM => located directly between both pumping wells RW10 and RW15 - intermediate zone The rationale for this well will be to monitor drawdown from both RW10 and RW15 to determine the composite influence of both pu mping wells RW10 and RW15. RW2 RW15 ~40 feet towards RW1 9 - intermediate zone The rationale for this well will be to monitoring drawdown in RW15 and to gauge the influence of the surface water boundary condition to the east of RW19. Salinity parameters are also recommended at RW19 to determine if the RW15 well is causing surface water to invade the intermediate unit. Placement of the three monitoring wells will be based on the above guidance, but field conditions during installation will also be taken into consideration prior to determining ultimate well placement. Proposed well locations are shown on Figure 5 . The approach to the aquifer testing will involve the following steps: Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 17 Background groundwater level evalua tion o place transducers in all monitoring wells listed below to automatically measure background groundwater variations over a one -week (minimum) time period prior to the Drawdown Test. Note that transducers shall remain in the monitoring wells for the d uration of the aquifer testing task. o collect manual groundwater elevation measurements from all monitoring wells . o shut down both RW10 and RW15 for a 24 - to 48 -hour time period allowing these wells to fully recover from pumping. o Collect groundwater elevati on measurements after RW10 and RW15 have fully recovered to determine non -pumping conditions / poss ible tidal influence . Drawdown Test (approx imately 4 days) o begin pumping RW15 at a rate consistent with historical operational rates for a period of 48 hrs. o begin pumping RW10 (keeping RW15 pumping) at a rate to be defined for a period of 48 hrs. o continue to measure groundwater elevations in monitoring wells during the drawdown test using the methods presented in the table below. Recovery Test (approx imately 4 days) o shutdown RW15 and measure recovery in pumping well and surrounding wells (see table). o after 24 -48 hrs recovery for RW15, shut down RW10 and measure recovery for 24 -48 hrs. o recovery period may be extended, as needed, to acquire groundwater elevation measurements during periods of precipitation or other potential events that could occur beyond a 4 -day recovery period. Resume normal operations for RW15 and RW10 following QA/QC data review of aquifer test results. Monitoring wells and associated monitoring methods to be utilize d during aquifer testing are as follows: Well Monitoring Method Corrective Measure Alternatives Evaluation There are various corrective measures and remediation tec hnologies being considered for the final remedial approach. Options , or combination of options being considered are, in no particular order: Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 18 In-situ stabilization of the source areas Source area material removal possibly including ex -situ stabilization o f the impacted soils prior to disposal Installation of a PRB along the west side of the property, either in continuous format or in a funnel and gate type arrangement Capping of previous source areas including use of engineered barriers that would be incor porated with the site development plan Modification of the existing groundwater pump and treat system to provide a more cost effective alternative for treating recovered groundwater rather than the current system and reliance on the central wastewater tre atment facility (HCWWTP) o Potential locations of additional recovery wells o Treating the groundwater \"onsite\" to support authorizations required for surface water discharges; treatment options being evaluated include: Groundwater treatment via adsorbent io n exchange technology Groundwater treatment via primary pH adjustment and secondary ion exchange resin Additional information is provided below regarding bench scale testing in conjunction with the preliminary screening evaluation of treatment concepts. Please recognize that this scope is intended as a screening process to determine whether these concepts can be considered as a viable treatment technologies for the former Rod and Wire Mill Area. Should these technologies be determined to have potential s uitability, work plans for additional design and pilot testing will be submitted for review and approval. PRB Alternative Four borings, designated as RW -01-GB through RW -04-GB, are planned along a potential PRB wall alignment as shown on Figure 4. The borings will be completed to a depth of 50 feet using hollow stem auger drilling methods and will be completed to ascertain the stratigraphy and geotechnical characteristics of the subsurface for constructability evaluations. Representative samples will be obtained from the borings for laboratory permeability, porosity and bulk density and grain size testing. Column testing of soil and groundwater will be conducted to represent a PRB type application (and possibly test an alternate injection applicat ion). EAG worked primarily with PeroxyChem to determine requirements for bench -scale testing the efficacy of a PRB type application and the following program is planned: I. 1 L of composite soil and 2 L of composite groundwater samples will be provided, at a minimum, from the borings along the western edge of the site a PRB would be installed, if that option is pursued). Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 19 II. PeroxyChem has been selected to facilitate the study, though the actual tests would be done at ReSolution Partners (a laboratory subcontracted to PeroxyChem that specializes in metals testing). III. Two reagents, EHC\u00ae Metals and MetaFix, each at 2 different dosages, will be evaluated for the purpose of the PRB. One untreated contr ol sample will also be evaluated a. Samples will be allowed to react with the reagents for a period of approximately 2 weeks in sealed containers b. After the reaction period, the samples will be subjected to the Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP ) and potentially leached with the site groundwater . Metals of concern will be evaluated using quick -turn screening analysis (1 -2 business days). Metals to be evaluated will include arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, zinc, and mercury. Additional groundwater data will be provided to PeroxyChem if other chemicals of concern are present in the soil and/or groundwater (such as VOCs or other non -metal chemicals of concern) . Groundwater Pump and Treat System Alternative Potential modifica tions for the existing groundwater treatment system are under consideration that would remediate contaminated groundwater with pumping and treatment equipment located at the Rod and Wire Mill Area. The treatment equipment would be designed to provide acce ptable discharge to surface water through a NPDES discharge permit. Planned groundwater modeling will support the possible modification designs. Bench scale treatability studies are planned to evaluate ion exchange and ozone/hydrogen peroxide treatment processes being considered for recovered groundwater treatment options. Ion exchange coupled with the adsorbent media is reported to routinely achieve effluent levels in the low part per billion range for most metals (including cadmium and zinc). The me dia acts as both an ion exchange resin and an adsorbent material. Another ion exchange option also being considered is a combination of pH adjustment followed by the use of a strong base cation exchange resin. Ozone and hydrogen peroxide may also be eval uated as a form of primary and secondary treatment should organics in the groundwater be identified as an issue with ion exchange treatment. Groundwater will be recovered directly from the current pumping wells to support the bench scale studies. Batch testing of groundwater is planned to determine optimum media for metals removal via ion exchange for design of possible onsite groundwater treatment system to replace the current IM or an expanded version of the current IM. EAG worked primarily with Evoq ua Water Technologies to outline this treatability study. I. At least 2 gallons of groundwater will be prov ided from Recovery Well RW -10. II. Evoqua Water Technologies will facilitate the study at their laboratory in Roseville, Minnesota. Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 20 III. The lab would run m etals content of the groundwater, as well as analyzing for water quality data such as iron, calcium, sodium, pH, total organic carbon (TOC), and total suspended solids (TSS) IV. The concept is to evaluate whether a \"precipitation to microfilter to sludge pres s\" system, likely with an ion -exchange bed as a polishing treatment, would be effective as a remedial treatment system for the groundwater a. Samples will be run through a bench -scale two -stage reaction chamber to elevate pH to achieve metals precipitation. Sludge would then be collected and processed through a filter press (with the cake being properly disposed of by the laboratory including analysis to determine proper management if employed full scale ). b. The effluent from the two -stage process will then go through a microfilter to ensure all solids removal, and then through another vessel to neutralize the pH. c. The final step will be to pass the water through a proprietary selective -media ion exchange vessel. d. The final effluent will be analyzed for metals content to determine the overall reduction of cadmium, zinc, and any other metals of concern. Once the efficacy of the groundwater treatment options is established via the bench studies, and if the concept of expanding the groundwater treatment sys tem is determined to be a viable option, onsite \"inline\" pilot testing would likely be conducted via a portable and/or temporary system. The recovered groundwater from the two currently active recovery wells would be routed to and through the pilot test equipment with the pilot test effluent being routed back into the existing pipeline and on to the HCWWTP. Should this type of pilot test (or tests) be deemed appropriate and needed, various flowrates would be evaluated over the span of one to four weeks, depending on the treatability results and various other factors. An addendum work plan to this one would be submitted at a later date if this path is pursued. Soil Stabilization Alternative Bench scale treatability studies are planned to support the ev aluation of soil stabilization options, whether in -situ or ex -situ. Batch testing will be conducted in order to determine the most effective reagent (or reagents), as well as to determine the most effective dosage. Various reagents and additive percentag es will be evaluated, including Portland cement, granulated ground blast furnace slag (GGBFS), bentonite clay or attapulgite clay and possible other commercial alternatives. Column testing will also be completed to evaluate injection options vs soil mixi ng options for in -situ applications. Bulk soil (a minimum of 4 pounds of soil per area to be evaluated) and bulk groundwater samples (a minimum of 2 liters of unpreserved groundwater per area to be evaluated) will be collected from the source areas for use in these studies. These samples are not planned to be preserved. The geotechnical testing planned during field activities will also provide useful data to be incorporated in the soil stabilization evaluations. Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 21 4 Data Quality Objectives Data Qua lity Objectives (DQOs) specify the appropriate quantity and type of data required to make informed environmental and risk management decisions, including tolerable levels of uncertainty. USEPA has developed a systematic process for developing DQOs that in cludes consideration of several critical elements. The process requires definition of the problem and statement of the decisions that will be made based on the study results. Information needed to support the decision -making process can then be defined, and includes identification of the constituents or parameters of interest, delineation of the physical boundaries of the study area, definition of the quantity of data that will be needed, identification of the means to collect the required data, and the l evel of uncertainty that will be acceptable. Program design can then be optimized to collect defensible data in the most efficient manner. For the purposes of this Phase II and Pre-Design Investigation Work Plan, the following specific decisions/question s have been identified: What is the current nature and extent of soil and groundwater contamination in the Rod and Wire Mill Area and are unacceptable risks to human health and the environment present? Is soil stabilization a viable method for addressing dissolved groundwater impacts in the Rod and Wire Mill Area , particularly in the former Sludge Bin and East Pond potential source areas? Is the use of permeable reactive barrier (PRB) a viable option to remediate dissolved phase groundwater contamination t hat is migrating from the Rod and Wire Mill Area to the west towards Bear Creek ? What groundwater treatment technologies are suitable to provide adequate treatment of groundwat er to support ongoing pump and treat systems with acceptable discharges to surfa ce water? As a result of the varying nature of the data required, there are several potentially applicable levels of data quality for this work plan . A primary component of data quality is selection of the appropriate analytical level for the intended dat a use. Analytical levels, as described in \"Data Quality Objectives for Remedial Response Activities\" (USEPA, March 1987), are as follows: Level I - Field screening or analysis using portable instruments. Results are often not compound -specific and not qu antitative, but are available in real -time. Level I data are appropriate for initial field screening and for health and safety monitoring. They are frequently used to determine sample collection locations for laboratory analyses. Level II - Field analy sis using more sophisticated portable analytical instruments; in some cases, the instruments may be set up in a mobile laboratory on location. There is a wide range in the quality of data that can be generated that is dependent on the use of suitable Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 22 calibration standards, reference materials and sample preparation equipment. Results are available in real -time or within several hours. Level III - All analyses are performed in an offsite analytical laboratory. Level III provides quantitative data. Docum ented sampling and analysis procedures must be used. Level III analyses may or may not use Contract Laboratory Program (CLP) procedures, but at a minimum, abbreviated CLP -type deliverables are required. Level III may require data validation and QA/QC proc edures conducted in accordance with USEPA guidelines. The laboratory may or may not be a CLP laboratory. Level IV - CLP-equivalent routine analytical services. All analyses are performed in an offsite analytical laboratory following CLP protocols. Lev el IV is characterized by rigorous QA/QC protocols and documentation with full validation of all data. Level V - Analysis by nonstandard methods. All analyses are performed in an offsite laboratory that may or may not be a CLP laboratory. Method develop ment or method modification may be required for specific constituents or detection limits. CLP Special Analytical Services (SAS) are Level V. For the purposes of this Work Plan , the Analytical Levels to be employed consist of Levels I , IV, and V . The A nalytical Levels to be employed consist of the following: Level I - Field Instrumentation Measurements Level IV - Contract Laboratory Program Equivalent Data Level V - Analysis by nonstandard methods to support bench scale treatability work Level I - Leve l I analytical data will consist of information generated using portable field instrumentation, specifically, a Photoionization Detector (PID) and water quality monitoring meters for measurement of pH, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, temperature, o xidation -reduction potential, and turbidity. Level IV - Level IV analytical data will consist of information generated via analysis of solid and aqueous phase samples by offsite fixed -base laboratories. Contract Laboratory Program level deliverables will be required such that validation of analytical data in accordance with the National Function Guidelines for organic and inorganic data review (USEPA, June 2008 and USEPA, January 2010) can be completed if necessary, at a later date. Level V - Pre-Design investigation data will no t be validated in support of this work plan and will be labeled in accordance with USEPA requirements for labelin g externally validated data. A NV (Not Validated) code will be applied to all pre -design data provided to the USEPA and MDE in electronic or hardcopy format, in accordance with USEPA requirements (USEPA, January 13, 2009). In the event that Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 23 validation is ultimately completed in support of risk assessment and/or fate and transport evaluations, the data will be relabele d accordingly. 4.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control All soil and groundwater samples will be collected using dedicated equipment including new soil core liners and polyethylene tubing. Each cooler temperature will be measured and documented by the labo ratory upon receipt. Quality control (QC) samples are collected during field studies for various purposes, among which are to isolate site effects (control samples), to define background conditions (background sample), and to evaluate field/laboratory vari ability (spikes and blanks, trip blanks, duplicates, etc.). The following QC samples will be submitted for analysis to support the data validation: Trip Blank - at a rate of one per day o Water - VOCs only Blind Field Duplicate - at a rate of one duplica te per twenty samples o Water - VOC, SVOC, Metals o Soil - VOC, SVOC, Metals Matrix Spike/Matrix Spike Duplicate - at a rate of one per twenty samples o Water - VOC, SVOC, Metals o Soil - VOC, SVOC, Metals The QC samples will be collected and analyzed in accord ance with the QAPP Worksheet 12 \u2014 Measurement Performance Criteria, Worksheet 20 \u2014Field Quality Control and Worksheet 28 \u2014 Analytical Quality Control and Corrective Action . Since all samples will be collected using dedicated disposable sampling equipment, no e quipment blanks will be required. 4.2 Data Validation The laboratory will provide full deliverable or CLP-equivalent data packages. Each data packa ge from the laboratory will undergo data validation procedures as outlined in Worksheet 34 - Data Verification and Validation Inputs , Worksheet 35 - Data Verification Procedures and Worksheet 36 - Data Validation Procedures in the QAPP. Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 24 4.3 Management of Investigation Derived Waste All investigation derived waste procedures will be carried out in accordance with metho ds referenced in the QAPP Worksheet 21 - Field SOPs and Appendix A of the QAPP , SOP No. 005 Investigation -Derived Wastes Management. Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 25 5 Data Evaluation and Reporting 5.1 Data Evaluation Data evaluation processes will be completed to docum ent the sample collection procedures and supporting rationale and present and interpret the analytical results . Data r esults will be presented in tabular and graphical formats as appropriate to best summarize the data for future use. Field and laboratory data will be tabulated and evaluated to determine if the regulatory and scientific objectives of the sampling and analysis program have been achieved , and whether any data gaps still exist . Phase II Investigation results will be compared against releva nt criteria such as the EPA Regional Screening Levels, considering appropriate land use factors and institutional controls, to identify contaminants and exposure pathways of potential concern. Recommendations for any additional site investigation activitie s, if warranted , will also be identified and presented . It is anticipated that the investigation of some of the RECs may indicate no evidence of a release, or indicate concentrations that may warrant a No Further Action Determination with a relatively sim ple risk screening due to the limited potentials for exposure under the planned redevelopment. In such a case, a limited exposure pathway analysis ma y result in a report with more conclusive recommendations . Evaluation of Pre -Design Investigation res ults, and the implications thereof, will be provided in textual, graphical, and tabular form. A recommended approach for the area wide responses will also be provided. Recommendations for collection of additional information will be provided as appropria te based on interpretation of the proof -of-concept information. It is planned that a project meeting with the USEPA and MDE will be conducted to discuss the results of the investigation and recommendations. Data gap analysis tools will be applied to conf irm sufficient data has been collected to support decision making regarding the selection of potential final corrective actions for the Rod and Wire Mill Area . 5.2 Reporting During implementation of the field work, it is planned that a monthly letter report will be provided to the USEPA and MDE. The letter report will summarize the work completed during the month, the implications of any observations, and the planned activities for the coming month. To the extent that figures are necessary to convey informa tion, it is planned that informal drawings will be provided (i.e., sketches and hand mark -ups of existing figures or aerial photographs). Key milestones will be identified in addition to the monthly reports, as necessary, to apprise the agencies of findin gs. Upon completion of the field work, sample analyses, and data evaluation, a Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Report will be prepared for review by the USEPA and MDE. A summary of the field Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 26 activities and any deviations from the planned scope of w ork will be provided. The report will also include a narrative explaining all field activities including dates, work completed , tabulation of results , and conclusions and recommendations for the Rod and Wire Mill Area. The Report will include the follow ing: Photo Documentation o Photos will have brief descriptions and will be dated Field Documentation o Copies of all laboratory chains of custody o Daily Field Report Summaries, including rough field sketches , as applicable o Any other pertinent documentation de emed appropriate by the Project Manager (especially if any deviation from this plan occurs) Tables o All geotechnical/engineering data collected o All chemical analytical data collected o All GPS coordinates collected Figures o GIS site maps showing the location of sampling points o Profile cross -sections o Current potentiometric maps under both pumping and non -pumping conditions o Current chemicals of concern iso -concentration/plume diagrams Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Work Plan Parcel A -3, Former Rod and Wire Mill Area Final - September 17, 2015 27 6 Project Schedule The field investigation, analytical testing, a nd bench testing activities are planned to be completed within six months of agency approval of this Work Plan. The Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Summary Report will be submitted to the regulatory authorities 60 days from the completion of the above activities. The general timeframes for the following components of the activities related to this work plan are as follows: Field investigation will take approximately eight (8) weeks to complete , including mobilization activities , once approval of t he work plan is received. Soil and groundwater sample analysis, data validation , and review is expected to require approximately six (6) weeks to complete , once the field investigation is complete. Bench scale treatability testing will be conducted upon r ecovery of sample materials o The duration of the bench scale treatability testing varies, but typically should take approximately 4 to 6 weeks, though some testing may go as long as 3 months (in which case, the EPA and MDE would be notified, accordingly) Preparation of the Phase II and Pre -Design Investigation Summary Report , including the internal QA review cycle, will require eight (8) weeks prior to final submittal to the MDE and the EPA.

It is located in Baltimore County, Maryland inthe southeast corner of theBaltimore metropolitan area (approximately 9 miles from the downtown are a),on theSparrows Point Peninsula in the Chesapeake Bay watershed . The facility occupies the entire peninsula and isbounded to the west by Bear Creek; to the south by Patapsco River; and to the east by Jones Creek, Old Road Bay and residential areas of the City of Edgemere. The facility is bounded to the north by the Sparrows Point Country Club. The site is approximately 3,100acresin size. Pennsylvania Steel built the furnace at Sparrows Point in 1887 and the first iron was cast in 1889. Bethlehem Steel Corporation (BSC)purchased the facility in 1916 and enlarged it by building additional and plating facilities. BSC filed for bankruptcy in 2001. A series of entities has owned the site between then and now : the International Steel Group (ISG) ,Mittal Steel ,ISG Sparrows Point, LLC ,Severstal Sparrows Holding LLC, which was renamed to Severstal Sparrows Point, LLC ,RG Steel Sparrows Point, LLC, and then a joint venture to Sparrows Point LLC (SP)and HRE Sparrows Point LLC. Most recently, in 2014,the property and assets were sold to Sparrows Point Terminal LLC (SPT). Environmental liability was retained by SPand work is currently being conducted by EnviroAnalytics Group, LLC (EAG) on behalf of SP. In addition to the current environmental inve stigation and remediation being conducted onsite byEAGand their consultants, there are other entities conducting work on the facility. Demolition of the remaining structures is currently ongoing at the site, and those contracto rs are being managed by SP T. The purpose of this document is to provide an overall health and safety plan (HASP) for EAG personnel and EAGdirected contractors who are engaging in environmental investigation and remediation activities onsite. EAGdirected contractors will also b e expected to have their own Health and Safety Program, and they may opt to drafttheir own site specific HASP ,provided it meets the requirements in this HASP. 1.2HistoricOperations Steel manufacturing involves handling vast amounts of raw material inc luding coke, iron ore, limestone and scrap steel,as well as recovering byproducts and managing waste materials. The operations listed below either were or are currently performed at the Sparrows Point Facility. Iron and steel production Coal chemical rec overy system Other byproducts recover ysystems Wastewater treatment systems Solid waste management Air pollution control6|P a g eA number of site -specific environmental and hydrogeologic investigations have been prepared for the Sparrows Point facility. For the purposes of this HASP, information was obtained from the \"Special Study Area Release Site Characterization\" completed in 2001 by CH2MHill , as well as additional documents submitted since that time . There are five separate Special Study Areas as put forth in the Consent Decree : Humphrey Impoundment , Tin Mill Canal/Finishing Mills Areas , Coke Oven Area , Coke Point Landfill , and Greys Landfill . Contaminated soils and groundwater may be present at the site. This plan was prepared based on an assessment of hazards expected to be present and a reviewof data from the previoussite investigations andgroundwater sampling events. During the current investigation s and remedial efforts ,allrelatedwork will be performed in accordance with the requirements of thi s HASP and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations as defined in 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.120 and 1926.65. 2.0PURPOSE, SCOPE AND ORGANIZATION This section describes the purpose, scope and organization of thi s HASP and the health and safety responsibilities of EAG , theiremployees , and their subcontractors involved in the field investigation and remediation activities at the Sparrows Point facility. 2.1Scope Field investigation and remediation activities for this project mayinclude, but are not limited to : Groundwater sampling and monitoring , Groundwater and remediation well installation , Groundwater and remediation well repairs, Groundwater and remediation well closureand abandonment , Surface water sampling , Sediment sampling , Soilboring and subsurface soil sampling, Soil excavations for remedial purposes , Installation and operation of remediation systems for soil, soil vapor, and groundwater , Decommissioning and closure of remediation systems , Soil excavat for stabilization, Exsitu soil mixing/soil stabilization, Dredging operations along Tin Mill Canal, Insitu chemical and/or biological injections, and Recovery of non -aqueous phase liquids (NAPL)7|P a g eWhen EAG per sonnel are providing oversight of subcontractors , they will attend the safety and health briefings held by the contractor. EAG personnel will follow the requirements of th isHASP, as well as any potentially more stringent requirements of the contractor's health and safety plan. When EAG personnel are conducting tasks on their own, with or without subcontractors, they will follow the requirements of this HASP. EAG contractors, such as drillers, will also be required to follow the requirements of this HASP ,as well as any more stringent requirements of the contractor's health and safety plan . All EAG field personnel, including subcontractors to EAG, will be required to read and understand this HASP and agree to implement its provisions. All site personnel w ill sign the Acknowledgement Form included in Attachment A stating that they have read, understood, and agree to abide by the guidelines and requirements set forth in this plan . 2.2Organization of Document This HASP includes health and safety procedures f or allgenerally anticipated project field activities. This plan also meets the OSHA requirements contained in the CFR, specifically 29 CFR 1910.120 and 29 CFR 1926, by including the following items: A description of staff organization, qualifications and responsibilities ( Section 2.3), Hazard analysis ( Section 3.0) , Health hazard information (Section 4.0), Personal protective equipment (PPE), including available first aid, emergency ,and safety equipment ( Section 5.0) , Employee and subcontractor training and standard safety procedures (section 6.0) , Exposure monitoring plan ( Section 7.0) , Medical surveillance (Section 8.0), Site control measures and decontamination procedures for personnel and equipment ( Section 9.0), Emergency response and contingency p rocedures (section 10.0 ), and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) for chem icals used on -site (Attachment B). 2.3EAG Health and Safety Personnel Personnel responsible for implementing this HASP include: EAG Contact s forSparrows Point Project Work VP Remediation, Russ Becker (314) 686 -5611 Senior Project Manager, James Calenda (314) Senior Project Engineer, Elizabeth 686 -55988|P a g e3.0HAZARD ANALYSIS This section outlines the potential hazards related to the field activities listed in Section 2.1. 3.1Hazard Analysis The field activities planned for this project pose pote ntial health and safety hazards for field team members.

Detailed chemical, physical ,and biological hazards information is provided in Section 4.0 (Health Hazard Information). Hazards to which employees and subcontractors may be exposed to as a result of the above -listed activities include potential chemical exposures, lacerations, excessive noise, thermal stress, lifting of excessive weight or bulk, hand tools and heavy equipment, drilling and slips, trips and falls. 3.1.1Chemical Hazards Potential exposures to chemicals in the soil or groundwater include the possibility of dermal exposure (contact and/or absorption), inhalation of chemical contamination that may be e ncountered during sampling or during equipment decontamination activities ,or ingestion of contaminants if good personal hygiene practices are not followed. Benzene,naphthalene , and various metals are themajor contaminants that have been identified in groundwater during pr evious investigations at the site In addition, light NAPL (LNAPL -benzene, in particular) and dense NAPL (DNAPL -naphthalene, in particular) have also been identified or are heavily suspected in various locations in the Coke Oven A rea.Dissolved metals the chemicals of concern primarily located in the area of Tin Mill Canal and the Rod and Wire Mill Area. Treatment chemicals, such as sulfuric acid, are currently being used in remediation systems. Allappropriate MSDS sheets will be reviewed that apply to the investigation or remedial tasks being conducted. MSDS sheets are located inAttachment B. It should be noted that this is a dynamic document: should any additional chemicals be introduced or discovered, the MSDS sheets will be added to Attachment B, as necessary . 3.1.2Physical Hazards The potential physical hazards associated with field activities include: Excessive lifting Slips, trips ,and falls Working at heights Exposure to extreme outside temperatures and weather Equipment hazards Drilling Hazards Noise Dust and fumes Injury from tools, equipment, rotating parts Electrical hazards Buried and overhead hazards Work over water Drivingto,from, and around the site(including working in trafficked areas)9|P a g eAdditional haza rds may be encountered based on the various task at hand. It will be the responsibility of thesite manager, with the help of field staff, to identify and address any additional hazards on a \"per task or job\" basis. A Job Safety Analyses (JSA) may need t o be conducted prior to the start of various tasks.Safety meetings will be conducted with all staff in attendance ,before the start of any new task or when any significant personnel or other changes (such as a swift change in weather , for example ) occur. Updated information relating to physical hazards will be presented during these meetings in an effort to familiarize the crew with potential hazards, discussnew situations ,anddetermine how the associated risks can be reduced.Further, good housekeepi ng practices will be enforced to preclude other risks resulting from clutter and inattention to detail. In addition, internal field audits will be randomly conducted to ensure adherence to all procedures are being followed. 3.1.3Biological Hazards Biological hazards that may be encountered when conducting field activities include the following: Poisonous snakes and spiders Ticks and tick -borne diseases Stinging insects such as chiggers, bees, wasps, etc. Variousviruses and diseases spread via animalto human contact such as West Nile virus or rabies Various viruses and diseases spread via human to human contact such as colds or the flu Dermal contact with poison ivy, oak ,and/orsumac Bloodborne pathoge ns when administering first aid First aid kits will beavailable on -site. It is crucial to note that any site personnel who has significant allergies should communicate that information to the field team they are working with, along with the location of theirauto-injector pen (such as an Epi -Pen)forusein case of going into anaphylactic shock from something that would cause such a reaction (like a bee sting, for example). Personnel who suffer from such allergies are responsible for providing their own auto -injector devices as those are typically prescription based as well as specific to their particular allergy. 4.0HEALTH HAZARD INFORMATION This section provides chemical hazard information for those potentially hazardous materials expected to be present at the facility. Potential physical and biological hazards are also discussed in this section. 4.1Chemical Hazards Exposure to chemicals through inhalation, ingestion ,or skin contact may result in health hazards to field workers. Hazards associated with exposure will be evaluated using OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Values (TLVs). Each of these values are 8 -hour, time -weighted averaged (TWAs) above which an employee cannot be exposed. EAG may also use the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Recommended Exposure Limits (RELs) where applicable. Although the OSHA PELs are the only exposure limits enforceable by law, the most stringent of exposure limits will be used as th e EAG-enforced exposure criteria during field activities .10|P a g eThe following is a summary of the potential hazards created by the compounds that may be encountered during field activities. Data from sampling of groundwater wells was reviewed to identify potential contaminants at the site. Contaminants of concern may include benzene, toluene, 4-1 contains chemical information and exp osure limits for various chemicals that may be expected to be present in the investigation and remediation efforts .During the recovery of NAPL, the major contaminant sofconcernarebenzene and naphthalene .It is possible that carbon monoxide may also be encountered from the use of various internal combustion engine s (vehicular or otherwise); however, it is anticipated that since any such engine will be used outdoors, it is not expected that concentrations of concern will accumulate. With the use of a ny such engine, t he engine shouldbe positioned such that site personnel are upwind of the engine exhaust. If any chemicals are brought on -site, MSDS must be made available and added to Attachment B . Personnel must be trained in the hazards and use of che micals.11|P a g eTable 4-1 Chemical Contaminants of Potential Concern Chemical Name Synonyms (trade name)Exposure Limits CharacteristicsRoute of eyes, skin, nose, respiratory system ,giddiness, headache, nausea, fatigue, anorexia, dermatitis, eyes, nose, throat, anorexia, weakness, muscular ache, pain, dark urine, cyanosis, liver, kidney damage, skin burns, dermatitis, of eyes, headache, confusion, excitement, malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, irritated bladder, profuse sweating, jaundice, hematuria, renal shutdown, dermatitis, eyes, nose, fatigue, weakness, confusion, euphoria, dizziness, headache, dilated pupils, lacrimation, nervousness, muscle fatigue, insomnia, eyes, nose, respiratory system, headache, fatigue, dizziness, co nfusion, malaise, drowsiness, incoherence, staggering gait, corneal vacuolization, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dermatitis12|P a g eChemical Name Synonyms (trade eyes, nose, respiratory sy stem, headache, fatigue, dizziness, confusion, yellow viscous liquid with a mild hydrocarbon odor.

Physical hazards that may be encountered inclu de the following: Heat and cold stress Lifting hazards Slips, trips and falls Working around heavy equipment Drilling hazards Noise Use of hand and power tools Buried hazards Electrical hazards Underground and overhead utilities Working over water Travel to and from site 4.2.1Heat Stress Local weather conditions may produce an environment that will require restricted work schedules in order to protect employees from heat stress. The Project Manager or the Field Lead Team Member will observe workers for a ny potential symptoms of heat stress. Adaptation of work schedules and training on recognition of heat stress conditions should help prevent heat -related illnesses from occurring. Heat stress controls will be stated at 70\u00b0F for personnel in protective cl othing and at 90\u00b0F for personnel in regular work clothing. Heat stress prevention controls include:15|P a g eAllow workers to become acclimatized to heat (three to six days) Provide rest breaks in a shaded or air -conditioned break area Provide sun screen to preven t sun burn Provide drinking water and electrolyte -replenishing fluids Keep ice readily available to rapidly cool field team members The following Heat Stress Index should be used as a guide to evaluate heat stress situations. If the Heat Stress exceeds 105degreesFahrenheit , contact the project manager prior toconducting work for detailed guidance .

Below 80\u00b0 FNormal RangeTypical conditions for time of year. Little or no danger under normal circumstances. As always, anticipate problems and work saf ely.16|P a g e4.2.2Cold Stress Frostbite and hypothermia are two types of cold injury that personnel must be protected against during the performance of field duties. The objective is to prevent the deep body temperature from falling below 96.8\u00b0 F and to preven t cold injury to body extremities. Two factors influence the development of a cold injury the ambient temperature, and wind velocity. R educed body temperature will very likely result in reduced mental alertness, reduction in rational decision making ,and/or loss of consciousness with the threat of death. Use appropriate cold weather clothing when temperatures are at or below 40 F as exposed skin surfaces must be protected. These protective items can include facemask, hand wear, and foot wear. Workers handling evaporative solvents during cold stress conditions will take special precautions to avoid soaking gloves and clothing because of the added danger of prolonged skin contact and evaporative cooling. Personnel will wear protective clothing appropriate for the level of cold and planned physical activity. The objective is to protect all parts of the body, with emphasis on th e hands and feet. Eye protection against glare and ultraviolet light should be worn in snowy and icy conditions. The work rate should not be so great as to cause heavy sweating that could result in wet clothing. If heavy work must be done, opportunities for rest breaks will be provided where workers have the opportunity to change into dry clothing. Conversely, plan work activities to minimize time spent sitting or standing still. Rest breaks should be taken in a warm, dry area. Windbreaks can also be u sed to shield the work area from the cooling effects of wind. Ifextreme cold -relatedweather conditions occur, EAG field personnel and subcontractors will take the following precautions: Wear adequate insulated clothing when the air temperature drops belo w 40\u00b0F Reduce work periods in extreme conditions to allow adequate rest periods in a warm area Change clothes when work clothes become wet Avoid caffeine (which has diuretic and circulatory effects) 4.2.3Lifting Hazards Fieldpersonnel may be exposed t o injury caused by lifting heavy objects and various pieces large or unwieldy pieces of equipment. All field team members will be trained in the proper methods for lifting heavyand/or large equipment and arecautioned against lifting objects that are too heavyor too big for one person. Proper lifting techniques include the following: Keep feet approximately shoulder width apart Bend at the knees Tighten abdominal muscles Lift with the legs Keep the load close to the body Keep the back upright Use the bu ddy system for larger or heavy pieces of equipment17|P a g eAll drums will be staged using an approved drum dolly or other appropriate equipment. Proper care will be taken in the use of this equipment. Healthy employees with no medical restrictions may lift and c arry a maximum of 50 pounds using proper lifting and carrying techniques. This recommended weigh tlimit may be reduced depending on physical and workplace factors. 4.2.4Slips, Trips and Falls The most common hazards that will be encountered during fiel d activities will be slips, trips and falls. Field team members are trained to use common sense to avoid these hazards such as using work boots/safety shoes with nonskid soles. When working on slippery surfaces, tasks will be planned to decrease the risk of slipping via avoiding the slippery areas, if possible, or utilizing engineering controls. Engineering controls may involve the placement of supplemental material such as boards, gravel, or ice melt should be utilized to mitigate slippery conditions. Other engineering controls may involve the use offootgear traction control devices . Employees and subcontractors will avoid slippery surfaces, use engineering controls as appropriate ,not hurry ,and maintain good housekeeping. 4.2.5Buried Hazards Whenever the ground is penetrated, the potential for contacting buried hazards exists. During the planning/mobilization phase, prior to drilling or other excavation activities , EAG personnel and/or their contractors will establish the location of underground u tility lines (gas, electrical, telephone, fiber optic cable, etc.) and/or substructures or other potential buriedhazardous items. This may be conducted by review of historic utility and substructure maps, private utility locates, ground penetrating radar , or other technologies. If thereis any evidence of utilities or subsurface objects/structures, drilling or excavation activities may be offset. If activities cannot be offset, measures will be taken to remove, disconnect, and/or protect the utilities and/or subsurface structures and/or objects. Every reasonable effort will be made to clear the area of intrusive work prior to fieldwork being started. 4.2.6Electrical Hazards It may be possible that overhead po wer lineswill be in proximate locations during drilling or excavation activities. At least a 20 foot clearance must be maintained from overhead power lines. No equipment such as drill rigs or dump trucks canbe moved while masts or buckets are in the upright position. Field personnel and subcontractor sperforming electrical work are required to be appropriately trained to work on the electrical systems in question prior to start of work. Authorization from project management personnel is required prior to any electrical work or work near overhead power lines .. When using extension cords, all field workers will ensure that they are in good working condition , are correctly rated for use, and do not contain abrasions such that bare wires could be exposed to the environment. Extension co rds will not be used in wet areas without plugging the extension cord into a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI). GFCIs will detect a short circuit and cut power. 4.2.7Heavy Equipment Operations Heavy equipment must be operated in a safe manner an d be proper ly maintained such that operators and ground personnel are protected.18|P a g eRequirements for Operators Only qualified , trained, and authorized operators are allowed to operate equipment Seat belts will be used at all times in all equipment and truck s Operators will stop work whenever ground personnel or otherequipment enter their work area ; work will resumeonlywhen the area has been cleared No personnel may ride on equipment other than the Authorized Operator No personnel may be carried or lifted in the buckets or working \"arms\" of the equipment Spotters will be used when ground personnel are in the vicinity of heavy equipment work areas and/or when an operator is backing equipment near other structures or congested area Requirements for Ground Pe rsonnel All ground personnel must wear orangeprotective vests in work areas with any operating heavy equipment Ground personnel will stay outside of the swing zone or work area of any operating equipment Ground personnel may only ent er the swing or work a rea of any operating equipment when: -They have attracted the operators attention and made eye contact -The operator has idled the equipment down and grounded all extensions -The operator gives the ground personnel permission to approach Ground personnel s hall never walk or position themselves between any fixed object and running equipment or between two running pieces of equipment Equipment Maintain operations manuals at the site for each piece of equipment that is present and in use Ensure operators are familiar with the manual for the equipment and operate the equipment within the parameters of the manual Ensure all equipment is provided with roll -over protection systems Verify that seatbelts are present and functional in all equipment Prohibit the use o f equipment that has cab glass which is broken or missing Ensure that backup alarms are functional on all trucks and equipment Require all extensions such as buckets, blades, forks, etc. to be grounded when not in use Require brakes to be set and wheels ch ocked (when applicable) when not in use Daily inspections of equipment are required using a Daily Heavy Equipment Safety C hecklist. Equipment deemed to be unsafe as a result of daily inspection will not be used until required repairs or maintenance occ urs. During maintenance/repair, ensure that motors are turned off, all extensions are grounded or securely blocked, controls are in a neutral position ,and the brakes are set. 4.2.8Drillingand Excavation Safety Prior toany intrusive work, as previously m entioned, the location of underground utilities, such as sewer, telephone, gas, water and electric lines must be determined and plainly staked. Necessary arrangements must be made with the utility company or owner for the protection, removal or relocation of the underground utilities. In such circumstances, excavation will be done in a manner that19|P a g edoes not endanger the field personnel engaged in the work or the underground utility. Utilities left in place will be protected by barricading, shoring, suspen sion or other measures , asnecessary. The use of unsafe or defective equipment is not permitted. Equipment must be inspected regularly . If found to be defective, equipment must be immediately removed from use and either repaired or replaced prior to resuming work with that equipment .Field personnel will be familiar with the location of first-aid kits and fire extinguishers. Telephone numbers for emergency assistance must be prominently posted and kept current. Good housekeeping conditions will be observed in and around the work area s. Suitable storage places will be provided for all materials and supplies. Pipe, drill rods, etc. must be securely stacked on solid, level sills. Work surfaces, platforms, stairways, walkways, scaffolding ,and access ways will be kept free of obstructions. All debris will be collected and stored in piles or containers for removal and disposal. The area of the site to undergo intrusive activity must be walked over with the drillers and/or heavy equipment operators to identify all work locations, as well as making sure all marked utilities are seen by those doing the intrusive work. Drilling Specific Concerns : In areas where utilities have been identified or may be suspected, pre -drilling clearance such hand - augering, hand excavation (with shovels or post -hole diggers), or air -knifing to a depth of at least 5' below ground surface (BGS) may be required. The Project Manager will provide guidance in those instances on what has been determined as an acceptable means of c learing drilling locations. It should be noted that if the soil lithology changes to gravel within those 5 feet, that may be an indication of a utility trench and extreme caution should be taken OR the drilling location should be offset 5 horizontal feetfrom the original location. Should 3 consecutive attempts be made without success to offset a particular drilling location, the field personnel should stop and contact the Project Manager for further instruction. Special precaution must be taken when usin g a drill rig on a site within the vicinity of electrical power lines and other overhead utilities. Electricity can shock, burn and cause death. When overhead electrical power lines exist at or near a drilling site, all wires will be considered dangerous . A check will be made for sagging power lines before a site is entered. Power lines will not be lifted to gain entrance. The appropriate utility company will be contacted and a request will be made that it lift or raise cut off power to the lines. The area around the drill rig will be inspected before the drill rig mast (derrick) is raised at a site in the vicinity of power lines. The minimum distance from any point on the drill rig to the nearest power line will be determined when the mast is raised or is being raised. The mast will not be raised and the drill rig will not be operated if this distance is less than 20 feet, because hoist lines and overhead power lines can be moved toward each other by the wind.20|P a g eBefore the mast is raised, personnel will be cleared from the immediate area, with the exception of the operator and a helper, when necessary. A check will be made to ensure safe clearance from energized power lines or equipment (minimum 20 -foot clearance). Unsecured equipment must be remov ed from the mast and cables, mud lines and catline ropes must be adequately secured to the mast before raising. After it is raised, the mast must be secured to the rig in an upright position with steel pins. Excavation Specific Concerns: For excavation work, entry into an excavated area or trench will only be allowed when: Shoring, sloping, and spoil pile placement is in conformance with 29 CFR 1926 Subpart P, and Personal protection and monitoring, as detailed in this HASP, has been implemented. All excavation contractors are required to provide an OSHA trained and certified Competent Person . Daily inspections of excavations, the adjacent areas, and protective systems shall be made by the Competent Person for evidence of a situation that could result i n a possible cave -in, indications of failure of protective systems, hazardous atmospheres, or other hazardous conditions. An inspection shall be conducted by the Competent Person prior to the start of work and as needed throughout eachshift. Inspections shall also be made after every rainstorm or other hazard increasing occurrence. All inspections made by the Competent Person should be recorded in the field log book. No personnel shall perform work in a trench or excavation that contains accumulated wa ter (any accumulated water will need to be either pumped out until the trench/excavation is dry, or the accumulated water is allowed to disperse naturally). Each employee in an excavation shall be protected from cave -ins by an adequate protective system e xcept when excavations are made entirely in stable rock or the excavation is less than 5 feet in depth and examination by the Competent Person provides no indication of a potential cave-in. Protective systems consist of sloping or benching, use of trench boxes or other shielding mechanisms, or the use of a shoring system in accordance with the regulations. When mobile equipment is operated adjacent to an excavation and the operators/drivers do not have a clear and direct view of the edge of the excavation, a warning system such as barricades, hand or mechanical signals, or spottersare required. Adequate protection shall be provided to protect employees from loose rock or soil that could pose a hazard to personnel in the excavation. All temporary spoil pil es shall be kept at least 2 feet away from the edge of the excavation. Spoil piles should be placed to channel rainwater or other run -off water away from the excavation. All excavations deeper than 4 feet deep and which have the potential to have a hazard ous atmosphere or oxygen deficient atmospheres ( less than 19.5% oxygen) must be tested to ensure safe working conditions, prior to entry. 4.2.9Use of Hand Tools and Portable Power Tools Hand tools will be kept in good repair and used only for their desig ned purposes. Proper protective eyewear will be worn when using hand tools and portable power tools. Unguarded sharp -edged or21|P a g epointed tools will not be carried in field personnel's pockets. The use of tools with mushroomed heads, split or defective hand les, worn parts ,or other defects will not be permitted. Inspect all tools prior to start-up or use to identify any defects. Tools that have become unsafe will be reconditioned before reissue or they will be discarded and replaced . Throwing or dropping of tools from one level to another will not be permitted; rather, containers and hand lines will be used for transporting tools from one level to another if working at heights . Non-sparking tools will be used in atmospheres where sources of ignition may c ause fire or explosion. Electric-powered shop and hand tools will be of the double -insulated, shockproof type ,orthey will be effectively grounded. Power tools will be operated only by designated personnel who are familiar and trainedwith their use. W hen not in use, tools will not be left on scaffolds, ladders or overhe ad working surfaces. 4.2.10Noise Exposure to high levels of noise may occur when working near drill rigs or other heavy equipment. Also, depending upon where the work is being perfor med, local equipment (e.g., airports, factory machines, etc.) may produce high levels of noise . A good indication of the need for hearing protection is when verbal communication is difficult at a d istance of 2 -3 feet.Personnel will be provided with ear plugs and/or earmuffs when exposed to noise levels in excess of the 8 -hour Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 90 decibel s. 4.2.11Work Zone Traffic Control Personnel will exercise caution when working near areas of vehicular traffic. Work zones will be identified by the use of delineators (traffic cones, flags, vehicles, DOT approved devices, temporary or permanent fencing, and/or safety barrier tape). Personnel will wear reflective vests when wor king in these areas. Depending on frequency, proximity , and nature of traffic, a flag person may also be utilized. 4.2.12Work Over Water If personnel will be working near, above or immediately adjacent to or within 6 feet of water that is 3 feet or more deep or where water presents a drowning hazard (e.g. , fast-moving stream, water body with a soft bottom), employees are required to a U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) approved personal flotation device (PFD). All PFDs must have reflective tape on them to facilitate visibility. Employees must inspect PFDs daily bef ore use for defects. Do no use defective PFDs. 4.2.13Vehicle Use Personnel must use caution when driving to , from, and across the site, paying special attention to other site traffic, as well as weather and road conditions. Heavy equipment should be tr ansported during no n- rush hour traffic. 4.3Biological Hazards22|P a g eSite activities on this Site may expose workers to other hazards such as poisonous plants, insects, animals, and indigenous pathogens. Protective clothing and respiratory protection equipm ent, and being capable of identifying poisonous plants, animals, and insects, can greatly reduce the chances of exposure. Thoroughly washing any exposed body parts, clothing, and equipment will also protect against infections. Avoiding contact with biolo gical hazards is the best way to prevent potential adverse health effects. Recognition of potential hazards is essential. When avoidance is impractical or impossible, PPE, personal hygiene, good general health and awareness must be used to prevent advers e effects.If working in wooded/grassy areas, use appropriate insect repellants (containing DEET and/or Permethrin) and apply them per the manufacturers' directions. The following is a list of biological hazards that may be encountered while performing f ield activities at the project site and surrounding areas: BIOLOGICAL HAZARD and LOCATION CONTROL MEASURES Snakestypically are found in underbrush and tall grassy areas.If you encounter a snake, stay calm and look around; there may be other snakes. Tur n around and walk away on the same path you used to approach the area. If a person is bitten by a snake, wash and immobilize the injured area, keeping it lower than the heart if possible. Seek medical attention immediately. DO NOT apply ice, cut the wou nd or apply a tourniquet. Carry the victim or have him/her walk slowly if the victim must be moved. Try to identify the snake: note color, size, patterns and markings. Poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac typically are found in brush or wooded areas.They are more commonly found in moist areas or along the edges of wooded areas.Become familiar with the identity of these plants. Wear protective clothing that covers exposed skin and clothes. Avoid contact with plants and the outside of protective cl othing. If skin contacts a plant, wash the area with soap and water immediately. If the reaction is severe or worsens, seek medical attention. Exposure to bloodborne pathogens may occur when rendering first aid or CPR, or when coming into contact with m edical or other potentially infectious material or when coming into contact with landfill waste or waste streams containing such infectious material.Training is required before a task involving potential exposure is performed. Exposure controls and personal protective equipment (PPE) area required. Hepatitis B vaccination must be offered before the person participates in a task where exposure is a possibility. Bees, spiders and other stinging insects may be encountered almost anywhere and may present a serious hazard particularly to people who are allergic.Watch for and avoid nests. Keep exposed skin to a minimum. Carry a kit if you have had allergic reactions in the past and inform the Project Manager and/or the buddy. If a stinger is present, remov e it carefully with tweezers. Watch for allergic reaction; seek medical attention if a reaction develops. Tickstypically are in wooded areas, bushes, tall grass and brush. Ticks are black, black and red or brown and can be up to one -quarter inch in siz e.Avoid tick areas. Wear tightly woven, light -colored clothing with pants tucked into boots or socks. Spray outside of clothing with insect repellent containing permethrin. Check yourself for ticks often. If bitten, carefully remove tick with tweezers . Report the bit to the Project Manager. Look for symptoms of Lyme23|P a g edisease that include a rash that looks like a bulls eye and chills, fever, headache, fatigue, stiff neck or bone pain. If symptoms appear, seek medical attention. 5.0PERSONAL PROTE CTIVE EQUIPMENT PPE ensembles are used to protect employees and subcontractors from potential contamination hazards while conducting project field activities. Level D is expected to be used for most activities at the site. The following subsections de scribe the PPE requirements for the field activities. 5.1Level D Protection When the atmosphere contains no known hazards and work functions preclude splashes, immersions or the potential for unexpected inhalation of or contact with hazardous levels of any chemicals, Level D protection may be used. Level D does not provide respiratory protection and onlyprovides minimal dermal protection. The Level D ensemble consists of the following: Work clothes that may consist of a short orlong-sleeved cotton s hirt and cotton pan ts, cotton overalls,or disposal overalls such as Tyvek Steel-toe/steel-shank work boots Safety glasses with side shields Hearing protection, as necessary Hand protection, as appropriate Hard hat when working around overhead equipment s uch as a drilling rig Reflective vests when working around heavy equipment or near roadways Body harness and life vests when working on or within 6 feet of b ulkheads, at heights, or in 3 feet or more of standing water (such as in Tin Mill Canal) 5.2Modified Level D Protection This is the level of protection that may be needed for material handling ,sampling operations , and operation of remediation equipment when splash hazards are present. Modified Level D protection consists of the following: Disposable overalls such as polyethylene -coated Tyvek Latex, vinyl ,or nitrite inner gloves when handling liquids/fluids Nitrile outer gloves (taped to outer suit) Chemical-protective over -boots (taped to outer suit) Steel-toe/steel-shank, high -ankle work boots Hard hatwith face shield Safety glasses with side shields or goggles Hearing protection, as necessary 5.3Level C Protection24|P a g eLevel C protection will be used when site action levels are exceeded and respiratory protection is required.

Personnel who have not met the requirements for the initial training will not be allowed in the Exclusion Zone (EZ) or Contamination Reduction Zone (CRZ) of any active work area . A copy of each subcontractor site worker's 40 -hour training certificate must be sent to th e Project Manager for review prior to the start of the site work. The 8-hourrefresher training co urse must be taken at a minimum of once per year. At the time of the job assignment, all site workers must have received 8 ho ursof refresher training with in the past year. This course is required of all field personnel to maintain their qualifications for hazardous waste site work. A copy of each subcontractor site worker's most recent 8 -hour refresher training certificate must be sent to the Project Mana gerfor review prior to the start of the site work. A site-specific safety orientation will be conducted by EAG for all EAG employees and subcontractors engaged in fieldwork. 6.1Onsite Safety, Health and Emergency Response Training25|P a g eThe OSHA 1910.120 stand ard requires that site safety and health training be provided by a trained, experience dsupervisor. \"Trained\" is defined to mean an individual that has satisfactorily completed the OSHA 40-hour Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) course and 8-hour site supervisor training. Training will be offered at the time of the initial task assignment and/or whenever new chemicals are introduced into the workplace. Training will include all applicable regulatory requirements, location of the program, inventory and MSDSs, chemicals used and their hazards (chemical, physical, and health), how to detect the presence or release of chemicals, safe work practices and methods employees can take to protect themselves from hazards, how to read MSDSs a nd site or project specific information on hazard warnings and labels in use at that location. All training will be documented and training certificates will be kept in the employee 's permanent training file. All applicable training will also require ann ual refreshers. EAG qualified personnel must also provide safety meetings. 6.2Standard Safety Procedures This section describes the standard safety procedures that EAG requires all onsite personnel to follow during site activities. 6.2.1General Saf ety Work Practices All onsite employees and subcontractors will observe the following general safety work practices: Health and safety tailgate briefings will occur to introduce new activities, any new safety issues , and emergency egress routes for work ar eas; any significant change (added personnel, change in scope, or change in field conditions) will trigger a second (or more) tailgate meeting to address whatever change occurred No food, drink ,or tobacco products will be allowed in the Exclusion and Cont amination Reduction Zones Loose clothing, hair ,and/orjewelry will not be permitted around moving or rotating equipment The \"buddy system\" will be implemented as necessary whereby a pair of co -workers watch es out for each other while in proximity of pote ntial physical work hazards Good housekeeping of all work areas will be maintained on an ongoing basis 6.2.2Hand Safety Thisstandard isintended toprotectemployees from activities protective equipment potential forhandinjuryduetosharpedges,corrosives, flammable andirritatingmaterials, extreme temperatures, splinters, etc. Guidelines for Working With and Around Equipment (Hand Tools, Portable Powered Equipment) : Employees should be trained in the use of all tool s. Keep hand and power tools in good repair and use them only for the task for which they were designed.26|P a g eInspect tools before use and remove damaged or defective tools from service. Operate tools in accordance with manufacturer's instructions. Do not remov e or bypass a guarding device for any reason. Keep surfaces and handles clean and free of excess oil to prevent slipping. Wear proper PPE, including gloves, as necessary. Do not carry sharp tools in pockets. Clean tools and return to the toolbox or storage area upon completion of a job. Before applying pressure, ensure that wrenches have a good bite. Brace yourself by placing your body in the proper position so you will not fall if the tool slips. Make sure hands and fingers have sufficient clearance in the event the tool slips. Always pull on a wrench, never push. When working with tools overhead, place tools in a holding receptacle when not in use. Do not throw tools from place to place or from person to person, or drop tools from heights. Inspect all tool s prior to start -up or use to identify any defects. Powered hand tools should not be capable of being locked in the ON position. Require that all power -fastening devices be equipped with a safety interlock capable of activation only when in contact with th e work surface. Do not allow loose clothing, long hair, loose jewelry, rings, and chains to be worn while working with power tools. Do not use cheater pipes. Make provisions to prevent machines from restarting through proper lockout/tagout. Guidelines for using Cutting Tools: Always use the specific tool for the task. Tubing cutters, snips, self -retracting knives, concealed blade cutters, and related tools are task specific and minimize the risk of hand injury. For more information about cutting tools, see Supplemental Information A. Fixed open -blade knives (FOBK) are prohibited from use. Examples of fixed open -blade knives include pocket knives, multitools, hunting knives, and standard utility knives. When utilizing cutting tools, personnel will observe the following precautions to the fullest extent possible: Use the correct tool and correct size tool for the job. Cut in a direction away from yourself and not toward other workers in the area. Maintain the noncutting hand and arm toward the body and out of the direction of the cutting tool if it were to slip out of the material being cut. Ensure that the tool is sharp and clean; dirty and dull tools typically cause poor cuts and more hazard than a sharp, clean cutting tool. Store these tools correctly wit h covers in place or blades retracted, as provided by the manufacturer. On tasks where cutting may be very frequent or last all day (e.g., liner samples), consider Kevlar\u00ae gloves in the PPE evaluation for the project. Do not remove guards on paper cutters.27|P a g e6.2.3Respiratory Protection Based on airmonitoring, anupgrade to Level C protection may be indicated. Half or full-face APRs will be utilized for protection again storganic vapo rs and particulates. All employees required to wear respirators will be need to be medically cleared, in writing to do so by a qualified Occupational Physician. All respirator users must be trained before they are assigned a respirator, annually thereafter, whenever a new hazard or job is introduces and whenever employees fail to demonstrate proper use or knowledge. Training will include, at a minimum: Why therespirator is necessary and what conditions can make the respirator ineffective . What limitation and capabilities of the respirators area. How to inspect, put on and rem ove and check the seals of the respirator. What respirator maintenance and storage procedures are. How torecognize medicals signs and symptoms that may limit or prevent effective use of the respirator. The engineering and administrative controls being usedand the need for respirators. The hazards and consequences of improper respirator use. How to recognize and handle emergency situations. Training will be documented and training certificated will be kept in the employee's permanent training file. 6.2.4Personal Hygiene Practices The field team must pay strict attention to sanitation and personal hygiene requirements to avoid personal contamination. The following instructions will be discussed and must be followed: During field activities, never put an ything in the mouth, including fingers All employees must wash their hands, forearms, face ,and neck before eating drinking, smoking or using the restroom Smokingis prohibited except in designated areas outside the work zone At the end of the day, all em ployees will shower upon returning home or to their hotel 6.2.5Electrical Safety All extension cords used onsite must be heavy -duty variety and must be properly grounded. All temporary circuitry must incorporate the use of GFCI devices. Refer to electr ical safety in Section 4.2.6, Electrical Hazards. 6.2.6Fire Safety All flammable liquids will be used only for their intended purpose and stored and handled only in approved containers. Portable containers must be the approved red safety containers eq uipped with flame arresters and self -closing lids. All transfers of flammable liquids must be made with the containers grounded or bonded. Also, gasoline containers will be clearly labeled and storage areas (if28|P a g eapplicable) will be posted with \"No Smokin g\" signs. Fire extinguishers will be stalled in all areas that contain flammable liquids. 6.2.7Illumination All work is planned for daylight ho urs. No special requirements are anticipated. However, should any work take place outdoors after daylight h ours, suitable lighting will be required. In addition, suitable lighting is to be provided in each remediation system building or enclosure. 6.2.8Sanitation Potable water and toilet facilitieswill be provided in compliance with the OSHA 1926.51 standa rd. Any container used to distribute drinking water shall be clearly marked and not used for any other purpose. Single drinking cups will be supplied, both a sanitary container for the unused cups and a receptacle for disposed of the used cups will also be provided. Port-a-johns will be provided since there are no sanitary sewers on the job site. 7.0EXPOSURE MONITORING P LAN This section describes air and personnel monitoring protocols, sampling method s,and instrumentation to be used , as well a sthe methods and frequency of sampling instrument calibration and action levels for potential work site hazards. When engaged in air monitoring, EAG personnel and subcontractors must use the forms to record air monitoring data and air monitoring instrume nt calibration records. All monitoring records/forms are to be maintained in the project file by theEAG Project Manager. 7.1Air Monitoring The surveillance program is established to detect changes in the ambient air at the work site and to ensure the c ontinuing safety of the work zones and adequacy of the level of worker protection. During field activities, the designated field team member will monitor the work site for combustible gas concentrations and organic vapors. Calibration of all monitoring e quipment will be performed in accordance with the manufacturers' procedures by trained EAG employees and subcontractors. The Project Manager, Project Field Team Leader or representative will be notified immediately of any contaminant levels that could tri gger an upgrade in PPE or cause a suspension of site activities. One or more of the following direct -reading instruments may be used to aid in this determination. Photoionization Detectors (PID) and Flame Ionization Detectors (FID) will measure non -specific organic gases and vapors. Combustible Gas Indicators (CGI) will detect explosive atmospheres. Oxygen (O2) meters will detect fluctuations in oxygen concentrations. These instruments should be calibrated or bump tested daily and whenever the readin gs may be erratic. All readings should be recorded in the field log books. Air monitoring results obtained from the breathing zone during field activities will be recorded in field logbooks. All such records will also include the location, date/tim e, weather conditions, person monitored, background concentration, and identification of specific contaminant whenever possible. Air monitoring information will be utilized to evaluate personnel exposure and assess the appropriateness of PPE for Site cond itions. 7.1.1Combustible Gas and Oxygen Deficiency/Excess Monitoring29|P a g eExplosive gas concentrations are not expected to exceed 10% of the lower explosive level (LEL). Should the need be indicated for monitoring, action guidance for the CGI/ O2meter respon ses is contained in Table7-1.

Contaminated or suspected contamin ated field derived wastes shall be disposed of in accordance with all local, state, and/or federal regulations. Field derived wastes include decontamination rinse waters and other related decontamination generated wastes. Soilsandgroundwater expected tobeencountered duringany sampling or existing data, maybedischarged tothegroundsurfaceintheimmediate vicinityofthemonitoring well.However, any known or suspected to be contaminated soil (in small quantities) or groundwater will be containerized for futureremoval, likely in 55 -gallon drums or other approved storage vessels. Depending on the suspected contaminants, the recovered groundwater may be sent through one of the onsite groundwater tre atment units. However, the treatment unit must be designed to address the contaminants of concern in the groundwater being treated. Otherwise, the liquid must be staged onsite for eventual offsite disposal at an approved facility. Impacted soil, if in drums, will be staged in an area designated by the Project Manager or Field Team Lead for eventual disposal. For large excavations, where excavated soil is stockpiled, it may be necessary to place soils on plastic and cover with plastic to prevent any po tentialleachable runoff. The Project Manager and/or Field Team Lead will provide the proper guidance necessary for handling bulk soil piles. Any NAPL recovered via remediation systems or manual recovery efforts will be properly containerized and eithe r disposed of offsite as a recyclable material, if possible, or as a hazardous waste. The receiving facility must be an approved facility. 10.0EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND CONTINGENCY PROC describethebasicemergency responses requiredshould an emergency take during field investigation or remedial effort activities . 10.1Emergency Phone Numbers Emergency telephone numbers are listed in Table 10-1.35|P a g eTable 10-1 Emergency Telephone Numbers and Agencies Agency Telephone Number Security(Sparrows Pointfacility) (410)388-7761 Ambulance 911 Fire 911 Occupational HealthClinic (410)633-3600 Hospital (410) 550 -0100 (general) (410) 550 -0350 (emergency) National Response Center (800) 424 -8802 PoisonControl Center -Maryland (800) 222 -1222 EAG Main Contact VP Remediation, Russ Becker (314) non-criticalinjury/illness, first aid will be administered by onsite personnel.

METHANE GAS LIQUID METHANE 14 0HEALTHFLAMMABILITY REACTIVITY RATING 34 0HEALTHFLAMMABILITY REACTIVITY OTHERNFPA RATING METHANE - CH 4 MSDS PAGE 2 OF 8 3. HAZARD IDENTIFICATION EMERGENCY OVERVIEW : Methane is an odorless, colorless gas, or a colorless, odorless liquid in its cryogenic form. Both the liquid and the gas pose a serious fire hazard when accidentally released. The liquid will rapidly boil to the gas at standard temperatures and pressures. As a gas, it will act as a simple asphyxiant and present a significant health hazard by displacing the oxygen in the atmosphere. The gas is lighter than air and may spread long distances. Distant ignition and flashback are possible. The liquefied gas can cause frostbite to any contaminated tissue. Rapid evaporation of the liquid from the cylinder may cause frostbite. Flame or high temperature impinging on a localized area of the cylinder of Methane can cause the cylinder to rupture without activating the cylinder's relief devices. Provide adequate fire protection during emergency response situations. Allow the released gas to dissipate in the atmosphere. SYMPTOMS OF OVEREXPOSURE BY ROUTE OF EXPOSURE : The most significant route of overexposure for this gas is by inhalation. The following paragraphs describe symptoms of exposure by route of exposure. INHALATION : High concentrations of this gas can cause an oxygen- deficient environment. Individuals breathing such an atmosphere may experience symptoms which include headaches, ringing in ears, dizziness, drowsiness, unconsciousness, nausea, vomiting, and depression of all the senses. Under some circumstances of overexposure, death may occur. Isobutylene also has some degree of anesthetic action and can be mildly irritating to the mucous membranes. The effects associated with various levels of oxygen are as follows: CONCENTRATION SYMPTOMS OF EXPOSURE 12-16% Oxygen: Breathing and pulse rate increased, muscular coordination slightly disturbed. 10-14% Oxygen: Emotional upset, abnormal fatigue, disturbed respiration. 6-10% Oxygen: Nausea and vomiting, collapse or loss of consciousness. Below 6%: Convulsive movements, possible respiratory collapse, and death. OTHER POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS : Contact with cryogenic liquid or rapidly expanding gases (which are released under high pressure) may cause frostbite. Symptoms of frostbite include change in skin color to white or grayish-yellow. The pain after contact with the liquid can quickly subside. HEALTH EFFECTS OR RISKS FROM EXPOSURE: An Explanation in Lay Terms . Overexposure to Methane may cause the following health effects: ACUTE : The most significant hazard associated with this gas is inhalation of oxygen-deficient atmospheres. Symptoms of oxygen deficiency include respiratory difficulty, headache, dizziness, and nausea. At high concentrations, unconsciousness or death may occur. Contact with cryogenic liquid or rapidly expanding gases may cause frostbite. CHRONIC : There are currently no known adverse health effects associated with chronic exposure to Methane. TARGET ORGANS : Respiratory system. PART II What should I do if a hazardous situation occurs? 4. FIRST-AID MEASURES RESCUERS SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO RETRIEVE VICTIMS OF EXPOSURE TO METHANE WITHOUT ADEQUATE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. At a minimum, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus and Fire-Retardant Personal Protective equipment should be worn. Adequate fire protection must be provided during rescue situations.

FIRST-AID MEASURES (Continued) Remove victim(s) to fresh air as quickly as possible. Trained personnel should administer supplemental oxygen and/or cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, if necessary. Only trained personnel should administer supplemental oxygen. In case of frostbite, place the frostbitten part in warm water. DO NOT USE HOT WATER. If warm water is not available, or is impractical to use, wrap the affected parts gently in blankets. Alternatively, if the fingers or hands are frostbitten, pla ce the affected area in the armpit, Encourage victim to gently exercise the affected part while being warmed. Seek immediate medical attention. Victim(s) must be taken for medical attention. Rescuers should be taken for medical attention, if necessary. Take copy of label and MSDS to physi cian or other health professional with victim(s). 5. FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES FLASH POINT (Closed Cup) : -187\u00b0C (-306\u00b0F) AUTOIGNITION TEMPERATURE : 650\u00b0C (1202\u00b0F) FLAMMABLE LIMITS (in air by volume, %) : Lower (LEL) : 5.0% Upper (UEL) : 15.0% See Section 16 for Definition of Ratings FIRE EXTINGUISHING MATERIALS : Extinguish fires of this gas by shutting off the source of the gas. Use water spray to cool fire-exposed containers, structures, and equipment. UNUSUAL FIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARDS : When involved in a fire, this gas will ignite and produce toxic gases including carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. An extreme explosion hazard exists in areas in which the gas has been released, but the material has not yet ignited. DANGER! Fires impinging (direct flame) on the outside surface of unprotected pressure storage vessels of Methane can be very dangerous. Direct flame exposure on the cylinder wall can cause an explosion either by BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion) or by exothermic decomposition. This is a catastrophic failure of the vessel releasing the contents into a massive fireball and explosion. The resulting fire and explosion can result in severe equipment damage and personnel injury or death over a large area around the vessel. For massive fires in large areas, use unmanned hose holder or monitor nozzles; if this is not possible, withdraw from area and allow fire to burn. RESPONSE TO FIRE INVOLVING CRYOGEN: Cryogenic liquids can be particularly dangerous during fires because of their potential to rapidly freeze water. Careless use of water may cause heavy icing. Furthermore, relatively warm water greatly increases the evaporation rate of Methane. If large concentrations of Methane gas are present, the water vapor in the surrounding air will condense, creating a dense fog that may make it difficult to find fire exits or equipment. Liquid Methane, when exposed to the atmosphere, will produce a cloud of ice/fog in the air upon its release. A flammable mixture will exist within the vapor cloud and it is advisable that personnel keep well outside the area of visible moisture. Explosion Sensitivity to Mechanical Impact : Not sensitive. Explosion Sensitivity to Static Discharge : Static discharge may cause Methane to ignite explosively. SPECIAL FIRE-FIGHTING PROCEDURES : Structural fire-fighters must wear Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus and full protective equipment. The best fire-fighting technique may be simply to let the burning gas escape from the pressurized cylinder, tank car, or pipeline. Stop the leak before extinguishing fire. If the fire is extinguished before the leak is seal ed, the still-leaking gas could explosively re-ignite without warning and cause extensive damage, injury, or fatality. In this cas e, increase ventilation (in enclosed areas) to prevent flammable or explosive mixture formation. For large releases, consider evacuation. Refer to the North American Emergency Response Guidebook for additional information.

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES SPILL AND LEAK RESPONSE : Uncontrolled releases should be responded to by trained personnel using pre-planned procedures. Proper protective equipment should be used. In case of a release, clear the affected area, protect people, and respond with trained personnel. Adequate fire protection must be provided. Minimum Personal Protective Equipment should be Level B: fire-retardant protective clothing, gloves resistant to tears, and Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus. Use only non-sparking tools and equipment. Locate and seal the source of the leaking gas. Protect personnel attempting the shut-off with water-spray. Allow the gas, which is lighter than air, to dissipate. Liquid Methane, when exposed to the atmosphere, will produce a cloud of ice/fog in the air upon its release. A flammable mixture will exist within the vapor cloud , and it is advisable that personnel keep well outside the area of visible moisture. If cryogeni c liquid is released, keep area clear and allow the liquid to evaporate. The gas that is then formed should be allowed to dissipate. Monitor the surrounding area for combustible gas levels and oxygen. The atmosphere must have at least 19.5 percent oxygen before personnel can be allowed in the area without Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus. Combustible gas concentration must be below 10% of the LEL (LEL = 5.0%) prior to entry. Attempt to close the main source valve prior to entering the area. If this does not stop the release (or if it is not possible to reach the valve), allow the gas to release i n- place or remove it to a safe area and allow the gas to be released there. RESPONSE TO CRYOGENIC RELEASE: Clear the affected area and allow the liquid to evaporate and the gas to dissipate. After the gas is formed, follow the instructions provided in the previous paragraphs. If the area must be entered by emergency personnel, SCBA, Kevlar gloves, and appropriate foot and leg protection must be worn. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE GAS. Protection of all personnel and the area must be maintained. PART III How can I prevent hazardous situations from occurring? 7. HANDLING and STORAGE WORK PRACTICES AND HYGIENE PRACTICES : As with all chemicals, avoid getting Methane IN YOU. Do not eat or drink while handling chemicals. Be aware of any signs of dizziness or fatigue; exposures to fatal concentrations of Methane could occur without any significant warning symptoms. STORAGE AND HANDLING PRACTICES : Cylinders should be stored in dry, well-ventilated areas away from sources of heat. Compressed gases can present significant safety hazards. Store containers away from heavily trafficked areas and emergency exits. Post \"No Smoking or Open Flames\" signs in storage or use areas. SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR HANDLING GAS CYLINDERS : Protect cylinders against physical damage. Store in cool, dry, well-ventilated area, away from sources of heat, ignition and direct sunlight. Do not allow area where cylinders are stored to exceed 52 \u00b0C (125\u00b0F). Isolate from oxidizers such as oxygen, chlorine, or fluorine. Use a check valve or trap in the discharge line to prevent hazardous backflow. Post \"No Smoking or Open Flame\" signs in storage and use areas. Cylinders should be stored upright and be firmly secured to prevent falling or being knocked over. Cylinders can be stored in the open, but in such cases, should be protected against extremes of weather and from the dampness of the ground to prevent rusting. Never tamper with pressure relief devices in valves and cylinders. Electrical equipment should be non-sparking or explosion proof. The following rules are applicable to work situations in which cylinders are being used: Before Use: Move cylinders with a suitable hand truck. Do not drag, slide, or roll cylinders. Do not drop cylinders or permit them to strike each other. Secure cylinders firmly. Leave the valve protection cap, if provided, in place until cylind er is ready for use. During Use: Use designated CGA fittings and other support equipment. Do not use adapters. Do not heat cylinder by any means to increase the discharge rate of the product from the cylinder. Use check valve or trap in discharge line to prevent hazardous backflow into the cylinder. Do not use oils or grease on gas-handling fittings or equipment. After Use: Close main cylinder valve. Replace valve protec tion cap, if provided. Mark empty cylinders \"EMPTY\". NOTE: Use only DOT or ASME code containers. Earth-ground and bond all lines and equipment associated with Methane. Close valve after each use and when empty. Cylinders must not be recharged except by or with the consent of owner. For additional information refer to the Compressed Gas Association Pamphlet P-1, Safe Handling of Compressed Gases in Containers . Additionally, refer to CGA Bulletin SB-2 \" Oxygen Deficient Atmospheres \". PROTECTIVE PRACTICES DURING MAINTENA NCE OF CONTAMINATED EQUIPMENT : Follow practices indicated in Section 6 (Accidental Release Measures). Make certain that application equipment is locked and tagged-out safely. Purge gas handling equipment with inert gas (e.g., nitrogen) before attempting repairs. METHANE - CH 4 MSDS PAGE 5 OF 8 8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS - PERSONAL PROTECTION VENTILATION AND ENGINEERING CONTROLS : Use with adequate ventilation. Local exhaust ventilation is preferred, because it prevents Methane dispersion into the work place by eliminating it at its source. If appropriate, install automatic monitoring equipment to detect the presence of potentially explosive air-gas mixtures and the level of oxygen. Monitoring devices should be installed near the ceiling. RESPIRATORY PROTECTION : Maintain oxygen levels above 19.5% in the workplace. Use supplied air respiratory protection if oxygen levels are below 19.5% or during emergency response to a release of Methane. If respiratory protection is required, follow the requirements of the Federal OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134) or equivalent State standards. EYE PROTECTION : Splash goggles or safety glasses, for protection from rapidly expanding gases and splashes of liquid Methane. HAND PROTECTION : Wear gloves resistant to tears when handling cylinders of Methane. Use low-temperature protective gloves (e.g., Kevlar) when working with containers of liquid Methane. BODY PROTECTION : Use body protection appropriate for task. Transfer of large quantities under pressure may require protective equipment appropriate to protect employees from splashes of liquefied product, as well as fire retardant items. 9.

Some of these which are commonly used include the following: CAS # : This is the Chemical Abstract Service Number which uniquely identifies each constituent. It is used for computer-related sea rching. EXPOSURE LIMITS IN AIR: ACGIH - American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, a professional association which establishes exposure limits. TLV - Threshold Limit Value - an airborne concentration of a substance which represents conditions under which it is generally believed that nearly all workers may be repeatedly exposed without adverse effect. The duration must be considered, including the 8-hour Time Weighted Average (TWA) , the 15-minute Short Term Exposure Limit, and the instantaneous Ceiling Level (C). Skin absorption effects must also be considered. OSHA - U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. PEL - Permissible Exposure Limit - This exposure value means exactly the same as a TLV, except that it is enforceable by OSHA. The OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits are based in the 1989 PELs and the June, 1993 Air Contaminants Rule (Federal Register : 58: 35338-35351 and 58: 40191). Both the current PELs and the vacated PELs are indicated. The phrase, \"Vacated 1989 PEL,\" is placed next to the PEL which was vacated by Court Order. IDLH - Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health - This level represents a concentration from which one can escape within 30-minutes without suffering escape-preventing or permanent injury. The DFG - MAK is the Republic of Germany's Maximum Exposure Level, similar to the U.S. PEL. NIOSH is the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, which is the research arm of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA ). NIOSH issues exposure guidelines called Recommended Exposure Levels ( RELs). When no exposure guidelines are established, an entry of NE is made for reference. HAZARD RATINGS: HAZARDOUS MATERIALS IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM: Health Hazard : 0 (minimal acute or chronic exposure hazard); 1 (slight acute or chronic exposure hazard); 2 (moderate acute or significant chronic exposure hazard); 3 (severe acute exposure hazard; onetime overexposure can result in permanent injury and may be fatal); 4 (extreme acute exposure hazard; onetime overexposure can be fatal). Flammability Hazard : 0 (minimal hazard); 1 (materials that require substantial pre-heating before burning); 2 (combustible liquid or solids; liquids with a flash point of 38-93 \u00b0C [100- 200\u00b0F]); 3 (Class IB and IC flammable liquids with flash points below 38 \u00b0C [100\u00b0F]); 4 (Class IA flammable liquids with flash points below 23 \u00b0C [73\u00b0F] and boiling points below 38 \u00b0C [100\u00b0F]. Reactivity Hazard : 0 (normally stable); 1 (material that can become unstable at elevated temperatures or which can react slightly with water); 2 (materials that are unstable but do not detonate or which can react violently with water); 3 (materials that can detonate when initiated or which can react explosively with water); 4 (materials that can detonate at normal temperatures or pressures). NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION: Health Hazard : 0 (material that on exposure under fire conditions would offer no hazard beyond that of ordinary combustible materials); 1 (materials that on exposure under fire conditions could cause irritation or minor residual injury); 2 (materials that on intense or continued exposure under fire conditions could cause temporary incapacitation or possible residual injury); 3 (materials that can on short exposure could cause serious temporary or residual injury); 4 (materials that under very short exposure causes death or major residual injury). NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION (Continued): Flammability Hazard and Reactivity Hazard : Refer to definitions for \"Hazardous Materials Identification System\". FLAMMABILITY LIMITS IN AIR : Much of the information related to fire and explosion is derived from the National Fire Protection Association ( NFPA ). Flash Point - Minimum temperature at which a liquid gives off sufficient vapors to form an ignitable mixture with air. Autoignition Temperature : The minimum temperature required to initiate combustion in air with no other source of ignition. LEL - the lowest percent of vapor in air, by volume, that will explode or ignite in the presence of an ignition source. UEL - the highest percent of vapor in air, by volume, that will explode or ignite in the presence of an ignition source. TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION: Possible health hazards as derived from human data, animal studies, or from the results of studies with similar compounds are presented. Definitions of some terms used in this section are: LD50 - Lethal Dose (solids & liquids) which kills 50% of the exposed animals; LC50 - Lethal Concentration (gases) which kills 50% of the exposed animals; ppm concentration expressed in parts of material per million parts of air or water; mg/m3 concentration expressed in weight of substance per volume of air; mg/kg quantity of material, by weight, administered to a test subject, based on their body weight in kg. Data from several sources are used to evaluate the cancer-causing potential of the material. The sources are: IARC - the International Agency for Research on Cancer; NTP - the National Toxicology Program, RTECS - the Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances, OSHA and CAL/OSHA . IARC and NTP rate chemicals on a scale of decreasing potential to cause human cancer with rankings from 1 to 4. Subrankings (2A, 2B, etc.) are also used. Other measures of toxicity include TDLo , the lowest dose to cause a symptom and TCLo the lowest concentration to cause a symptom; TDo, LDLo , and LDo, or TC, TCo, LCLo , and LCo, the lowest dose (or concentration) to cause lethal or toxic effects. BEI - Biological Exposure Indices, represent the levels of determinants which are most likely to be observed in specimens collected from a healthy worker who has been exposed to chemicals to the same extent as a worker with inhalation exposure to the TLV. Ecological Information: EC is the effect concentration in water. REGULATORY INFORMATION: This section explains the impact of various laws and regulations on the material.

The victim may experience tightness in the chest, breathlessness, and loss of consciousness. Tremors, convulsions, and death due to respiratory paralysis or circulatory collapse can occur in a few minutes to several hours following seve re exposures. Aspiration of small amounts of liquid immediately causes pulmonary edema and hemorrhage of pulmonary tissue. Direct skin contact may cause erythema. Repeated or prolonged skin contact may result in drying, scaling dermatitis, or development o f secondary skin infections. The chief target organ is the hematopoietic system. Bleeding from the nose, gums, or mucous membranes the development of purpuric spots, pancytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, and leukemia may occur as the condition progresses. The bone marrow may appear normal, aplastic or hyperplastic, and may not correlate with peripheral blood -forming tissues.
