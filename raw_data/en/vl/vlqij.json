Posted December 13, 2020 | [ Reviewed by Lybi Ma ](/us/docs/editorial-process) As public discussion turns to who will be first in line for [coronavirus](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/coronavirus-disease-2019) vaccination, prisoners are mostly left off the list, even though prisoners are known to have a very high rate of coronavirus infection and the infection of prisoners poses a public health danger to the community. Prisons and jails, like hospitals and nursing homes, are \"total institutions.\" There are a large number of individuals in a confined space and it is next to impossible to provide for social distancing, enhanced hygiene, healthy ventilation, masks, hand-washing, sanitizing, and health-supporting activities such as regular exercise and ongoing healthy social interaction. Officers are often less than rigorous about wearing masks, washing hands, and maintaining social distance. They are even reported to cross over without proper precautions from areas of the prison designated for infected prisoners to areas where there are no known infections, further spreading the coronavirus. Prisoners disproportionately suffer from medical illnesses that increase their susceptibility to viral infection and serious illness. The rate of infection with coronavirus among prisoners is five times higher than in the community-at-large, and the risk of serious illness and death is extraordinarily high as well. From a public health perspective, it makes a great deal of sense to vaccinate prisoners on a priority basis, just as there are plans to vaccinate healthcare workers and residents of nursing homes first when the vaccine becomes available. Yet nobody is talking seriously about moving prisoners to the front of the line for vaccination. It is as if people think, \"They're criminals, they don't deserve to be at the head of the line for the vaccine.\" In other words, it is stigma that prevents officials from taking the logical step of prioritizing the early immunization of prisoners. The pandemic forces us to confront a foolhardy assumption that prisons and prisoners are entirely separate and apart from society. The rhetoric is \"lock-'em-up-and-throw-away-the-key,\" as if prisoners and what goes on in prison are outside of society and can be safely ignored. In fact, the many abuses that proliferate behind bars\u2014crowding, violence, untreated serious mental illness, [sexual abuse](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sexual-abuse), and prolonged solitary confinement\u2014would not be possible if there were greater governmental and community oversight and public concern. The coronavirus is not bound by the stigma and the disappearing. Staff and visitors enter and leave our jails and prisons regularly. Prisoners leave at the end of their term. And so does the coronavirus. The virus enters jails and prisons, incubates, and then exits to raise the infection level in the community. The coronavirus educates us. It teaches us that prisons are not a place apart. It is not only the coronavirus that enters and leaves the prisons. Social failure is incubated in the prisons as well. People cycle through our jails and prisons and return to the community. We cannot isolate the coronavirus in the prisons, and similarly, we cannot prevent dreadful prison conditions from negatively affecting life in the community. Some 93 percent of prisoners will eventually be released to face unemployment, homelessness, and disabilities caused by [stressful](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress) prison conditions as well as insufficient rehabilitation programming and inadequate medical and mental health treatment. In recognition of the porousness of prison walls, we must begin to control the damage to the community by immunizing prisoners on an urgent basis against coronavirus. Stigma should not determine public health policy, nor criminal justice policy. Once we learn that lesson in regard to the coronavirus, we must apply it to reducing the prison population and providing prisoners the [education](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/education), vocational training, and social skills they need to succeed at \"going straight\" after they are released.
