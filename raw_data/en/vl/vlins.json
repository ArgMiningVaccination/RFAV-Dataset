One of the main reasons being that we think we need to take our new \"diet\" head on; restricting ourselves from our daily edible pleasures only to consume bland foods that we have been told are good for us. On top of that we have advertisements trying to pawn off products that are supposedly healthy, but do not even resemble real food in any way, shape, or form. My first rule of easing into a healthier diet and lifestyle, is starting off in small steps. Start by reducing and replacing, instead of just restricting foods. Addicted to [coffee](/series/green-matters)? Try reducing the amount, buy fair trade and organic coffee, and instead of milk and sugar, try coconut milk and honey. Too much change too fast? No problem! Instead of having your usual five cups before breakfast, try four this week, next week try three and so forth. Go at your own pace and remember to lay off the guilt. Learning to love yourself, and allowing yourself to make mistakes, is all part of letting yourself be healthy. Now don't get me wrong, some people have an all or nothing attitude and it works for them, but a lot of people don't; and most times will end up finding themselves giving up on their New Year's resolution by March. Sound familiar? Then this is for you! What exactly are the components of a healthy diet? 1. Eat Seasonally/Locally. Eating seasonally and locally allows you to get the freshest foods available, and when we eat the freshest foods we are guaranteed to be able to consume the most nutrients. The closer it was grown to home, the less time it spent in a truck and the more you and your body will benefit from it. 2. Drink plenty of water. Water composes 75% of your brain, 22% of your bones, removes wastes, helps covert food into energy, and helps your body absorb nutrients among many other valuable functions! Did you know that most of us can't tell the difference between hunger and thirst? Next time you are hungry [try having a glass of water](/article/5-energy-cleansing-water-rituals) and see how you feel 30 minutes after. You may be surprised. 3. Eat often, don't skip meals. Eat consistently throughout the day as opposed to having just three square meals. Make snacks ahead of time so you can have them on the go. Eating smaller meals throughout the day will help control your blood sugar levels, increase your energy levels and mood. 4. Tasty and Appealing. Healthy food does not mean bland, tasteless and boring. Have fun with your food, play around with recipes, experiment with different types of herbs and spices. Not only will this enhance the flavour of your food, but it can also have some great added health benefits. Turmeric is great for inflammation, oregano and [ginger](/article/clean-eating-recipes-conscious-cleanse) are great for your digestive system. Connect with your food and create something that makes you feel great. 5. 80/20 Rule. Let yourself indulge occasionally. If you eat a [whole foods](/article/top-10-cleansing-foods-for-natural-detox) based diet most of the time, your body will be able to process that bad stuff once and a while! Remember that it's OK to fall off the wagon now and again, as long as you are on it most of the time. Try this yummy summer recipe!
