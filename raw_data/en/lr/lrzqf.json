This functional eligibility requirement is also known as meeting a nursing home or intellectual/developmental disability level of care. The HRS Table is extremely important in determining a person's program eligibility. (See [ Module 1.2](/functionalscreen/ltcfs/instructions1.htm#2) of the functional screen instructions for more information.) 7.2 The HRS Table and Need for Health Care Provider Consultation Screeners are not expected to be medical or nursing experts and should consult as needed with health care providers to accurately complete the HRS Table. Screeners who are nurses may not need to consult another medical professional, but screeners who are not nurses may need to obtain information through one of the following methods: - Consult with your agency nurse on completing the HRS Table. - Fax a health information form to the person's physician. Ask what type of health-related services the person needs and at what frequency. It is important to determine if the person is independent or needs assistance from another person to complete the task. - Talk to the person's physician or nurse. Ask them the same questions in the above bullet. 7.3 Completing the HRS Table and General Rules for its Use The HRS Table should be completed to show the presence and frequency of each health-related service according to the instructions in this module. Some frequencies, which are not applicable for a particular service, are blanked out. A supplement to the HRS module has been developed. This supplement contains some HRS tasks that are seen more consistently in the community than in the past and are not currently included on the HRS Table. Refer to the [HRS Supplement, P-02525](/publications/p02525.pdf) (PDF) for more information. General Rules for the HRS Table - It does not matter who is performing the skilled task (except for the \"Requires Nursing Assessment and Interventions\" task). Family members are often taught to complete very technical skilled nursing tasks. - Be careful not to overlook assistance provided by informal supports. Sometimes a person may appear independent with an HRS task, but in reality they are receiving assistance (for example, telephone calls to remind the person to take their medication). - The HRS Table records skilled nursing tasks primarily provided in the person's home, not in a hospital, clinic, or office. A person's home or current residence is defined in [Module 3.17](/functionalscreen/ltcfs/instructions3.htm#17). The only exceptions are dialysis, transfusions, skilled therapies, ulcer care or wound care (under certain situations), and behaviors requiring interventions, including wandering, self-injurious behavior, or an offensive or violent behavior towards others. See the applicable sections in this module for additional information. - When more than one \"Frequency of Help/Services Needed from Other Persons\" (column) applies to one HRS task (row), select the frequency of the task completed most often. [Module 7.7](/functionalscreen/ltcfs/instructions7.htm#7)provides an example. - The \"Check this for a person who\" and the \"Do not check this for a person who\" lists contain common, illustrative examples. These are not all inclusive lists of examples. \"Needs\" Versus \"Receiving\" - The HRS Table is designed to document a person's need for assistance with health-related service(s), not just the assistance he or she is currently receiving. For example, a person receives weekly medication management assistance when the person's daughter refills their medication box during her visit each Sunday, although that assistance is only needed at a frequency of one to three times per month. In this case, select the \"1-3 times/month\" frequency of assistance needed. - Be sure to indicate if the person is independent with an HRS task, even if they are currently receiving assistance with the task. For example, a nursing home resident may be physically and cognitively capable of taking their medications independently even though nurses administer their medications. - For a person living in a residential care facility, assess the person's actual need for assistance and do not select the level of assistance needed based on the services provided as part of the residential facility package. - Assess the person's need for assistance based on a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment and do not select the level of assistance provided based on a diagnosis, age bias, gender role, or cultural norm. - The HRS Table is not designed to capture acute, primary, or in-clinic services (except for dialysis, transfusions, ulcer care, or wound care [under certain situations], and skilled therapies). See the applicable sections in this module for further information. - Be sure to indicate if the person is independent with a task, even if the person is currently receiving help or services. - Assess the person's need for assistance and do not select the level of assistance needed based on an age, gender, or cultural norm. Need for Assistance: To reflect a person's NEED for assistance, the screener should select the most accurate answer that most closely describes the person's NEED for \"help from another person,\" whether the person is actually receiving that assistance or not. Help from another person is defined as supervision, cueing, and/or hands-on assistance (partial or complete). - If a person has an identified need but is not receiving assistance (this includes declining the assistance and a significant, negative health outcome occurs), the screener should still capture the need for the assistance from another person to complete the task. - If a person has an identified need but they have declined assistance and there is no significant negative health outcome, the screener is to select Independent. - If a person has a legal guardian, an activated power of attorney for health care, or is currently involved with adult protective services, that person may be considered not able to perceive and recognize potential risks or negative health outcomes and the selection of a need might be appropriate. Declining the task: If the individual has declined to complete the health-related service or task itself, and is able to perceive and recognize the potential risk or negative health outcome that could result from declining the task, the screener should leave the default selection of \"N/A.\" In this situation, the person has no need for assistance with the health-related service or task because the health-related service or task is not occurring. Examples include, but are not limited to: - If an individual able to perceive potential risk or negative outcome chooses not to take any prescribed medications, the person has no need for medication administration or medication management assistance because no medications are being taken. - If an individual able to perceive potential risk or negative outcome chooses not to use oxygen and/or respiratory treatments, such as a Bi-PAP machine, the person has no need for assistance because no task is occurring. - If an individual able to perceive potential risk or negative outcome chooses not to participate in skilled therapies, the person has no need for assistance because no therapy is occurring. If the person is not able to perceive and recognize the potential risk or negative health outcome that could result from declining the task, the screener should select the frequency of need. If a person has a legal guardian, an activated power of attorney for health care, or is currently involved with adult protective services, that person may be considered not able to perceive and recognize potential risks or negative health outcomes, and the selection of a need might be appropriate. 7.4 Avoid Double-Dipping on the HRS Table If assistance with a task is indicated in one row of the HRS Table, that need for assistance should not also be indicated in another row. HRS needs are to be recorded on only one row of the HRS Table. Examples can include, but are not limited to: - When an individual only needs assistance with their IV medication, this does not also indicate a need for assistance to record on the Medication Administration and Medication Management rows. - When an individual receives a registered nurse's assistance with their needed ulcer care (\"Ulcer-Stage 2\" or \"Ulcer-Stage 3 or 4\"), this does not also indicate a need for assistance to record on the Requires Nursing Assessment and Interventions row. - When an individual receives a registered nurse's assistance with needed pain management (Medication Management), this does not also indicate a need for assistance to record on the Requires Nursing Assessment and Interventions row. - An individual with congestive heart failure has just had their fluid retention medication adjusted. A registered nurse comes to the home to access their fluid retention and the effectiveness of the medication adjustment (Medication Management), this does not also indicate a need for assistance to record on the Requires Nursing Assessment and Interventions row. - When an individual has a registered nurse come to their home to draw a blood sample for a laboratory test (Medication Management), this does not also indicate a need for assistance to record on the Requires Nursing Assessment and Interventions row. HEALTH-RELATED SERVICES TABLE Check only one box per row. Leave row blank if not applicable. / Range |IV Medications, Fluids or IV Line Flushes| |Medication Administration (not IV) or Assistance with Pre-Selected or Set-Up Medications| |Medication Management: Set up and/or Monitoring (for Effects, Side Effects, Adjustments, Pain Management) and/or Blood Levels| |Ostomy-Related Skilled Services| |Positioning in Bed or option||Not an |Urinary Catheter-Related Skilled Tasks (Irrigation, Straight Catheterizations)| |Other Wound Cares (Not Catheter Sites, Ostomy Sites, - Stage Help from Other Persons| |Skilled Therapies\u2014PT, OT, SLP (Any One or a Combination, at Any Location)||1-4 sessions/week||5+ sessions/week| Who will help with all health-related needs in next eight (8) weeks (check all that apply) - U: Current UNPAID caregiver will continue - PP: Current PRIVATELY PAID caregiver will continue - PF: Current PUBLICLY FUNDED paid caregiver will continue - N: Need to find new or additional caregiver(s) 7.5 Person is NOT Independent in Completing and Managing a Health-Related Service If the person is not independent in completing and managing a health-related service, select the column indicating the most accurate \"Frequency of Help/Services Needed from Other Persons.\" The frequencies of help/services needed from another person are as follows: - Person is independent - 1 to 3 times/month - Weekly - 2 to 6 times/week - 1 to 2 times/day - 3 to 4 times a day - 5 or more times a day The definitions for each HRS task (each row) list the skilled tasks the screener is to focus on, and in some cases includes which tasks to ignore. For instance, in the Urinary Catheter-Related Skilled Tasks row, the screener is to ignore the unskilled task of emptying the bag and only consider the skilled tasks (replacing the catheter, irrigating the catheter). When more than one \"Frequency of Help/Services Needed from Other Persons\" (column) applies to one HRS task (row), select the frequency of the task completed most often. (Module 7.7 provides an example.) 7.6 Person is INDEPENDENT in Completing and Managing a Health-Related Service If the person is independent in completing and managing a health-related service, select the column \"Person is Independent.\" The HRS Table is designed to document the person's need for assistance with health-related service(s), not just what assistance the person is currently receiving. Be sure to indicate if the person is independent, even if the person is currently receiving help or services with other tasks. Example: Amy is currently in the hospital but will be discharged soon. She has the physical and cognitive ability to manage and administer her own medications. However, hospital policy requires that all medications be managed by hospital nurses. The screener should indicate Amy is independent with Medication Management and Administration, even though she currently receives assistance from the hospital's nurses. 7.7 Person is INDEPENDENT With Some Tasks, but NOT Independent With Others In many cases, a person is independent with some tasks, but needs help from another person with other tasks related to the same health condition. For example, with the task of Medication Management, a person may independently set up their medications but needs assistance with their blood glucose checks. Pay attention to the column headings that indicate the \"Frequency of Help/Services Needed from Other Persons.\" Example: Inez does her own ankle dressing for a wound twice a day but can't see well and is unable to judge if it's getting worse or better. A nurse examines it once a week to be sure it's healing well and to adjust the wound care as needed. Inez calls the nurse if she has any problems in between. The screener would select \"Weekly\" for the \"Frequency of Help/Services Needed from Other Persons.\" Do not select the \"1-2 times/day\" frequency since Inez independently completes her wound care, twice a day. 7.8 Person Declines the Task Declining the task: If the individual has declined to complete the health-related service or task itself, and is able to perceive and recognize the potential risk or negative health outcome that could result from declining the task, the screener should leave the default selection of \"N/A.\" In this situation, the person has no need for assistance with the health-related service or task because the health-related service or task is not occurring. Examples include, but are not limited to: - If an individual able to perceive potential risk or negative outcome chooses not to take any prescribed medications, the person has no need for medication administration or medication management assistance because no medications are being taken. - If an individual able to perceive potential risk or negative outcome chooses not to use oxygen and/or respiratory treatments, such as a Bi-PAP machine, the person has no need for assistance because no task is occurring. - If an individual able to perceive potential risk or negative outcome chooses not to participate in skilled therapies, the person has no need for assistance because no therapy is occurring. If the person is not able to perceive and recognize the potential risk or negative health outcome that could result from declining the task, the screener should select the frequency of need. If a person has a legal guardian, an activated power of attorney for health care, or is currently involved with adult protective services, that person may be considered not able to perceive and recognize potential risks or negative health outcomes, and the selection of a need might be appropriate. 7.9 Indicate Frequency of Skilled TASKS, Not Duration of Condition For conditions that are continually present (e.g., an in-dwelling or continuous urinary catheter), the screener should indicate the frequency of skilled tasks related to the health-related service. When one HRS condition involves more than one skilled task, provided at different frequencies, select the frequency of the task completed most often from another person. Or, in other words, the highest frequency at which help is needed from another person. Example: Bob has a permanently placed urinary catheter. A nurse changes the catheter every 30 days. Daily catheter care is just soap and water cleaning completed during bathing (which is not to be considered an HRS task) and no other urinary catheter care is needed. Bob also has a tracheostomy. Tasks related to his tracheostomy include having a nurse change the tracheostomy tube monthly and an aide clean the tracheostomy site twice a day. He is generally self-directing and stable and visits his doctor's office only once every four to six months. In this example, the screener should make TWO selections on the HRS Table: 1) Urinary Catheter-Related Skilled Tasks at \"1-3 times/month\" and Tracheostomy Care at \"1-2 times/day.\" Instructions for Specific Health-Related Services 7.10 Identifying Primary and Secondary Diagnoses To be selected as a primary or secondary diagnosis that causes a need for assistance or support from another person, the need must be due to a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment, with one exception as outlined in the section titled \"Exception to Physical, Cognitive, or Memory Loss Impairment Requirement.\" For each need or additional support, including some selections of adaptive equipment, identified in the LTCFS, the diagnoses that cause the need or necessary support must be selected from options prepopulated in a drop-down menu. Only diagnoses that were previously identified on the Diagnoses Table will be prepopulated in the drop-down menus. FSIA will use these diagnoses to assign the correct target group(s) for each individual who is being screened. Primary and secondary diagnoses carry equal weight in regard to assignment of target group by FSIA. One diagnosis must be selected from the drop-down menu under primary diagnosis for each need or support identified on the screen. Under secondary diagnosis, a selection must be made from the drop-down menu. If there is no secondary diagnosis contributing to the need for assistance, the screener must select \"None.\" When determining which diagnosis to select from the primary or secondary diagnosis drop-down menu, the screener is to be thoughtful and consistent. The diagnosis selected should justify and explain the need for assistance from another person. If there is only one diagnosis that affects the need for assistance, the screener would select \"None\" from the drop-down menu under secondary diagnosis. If a person has more than one diagnosis that corresponds to the person's need, the screener could choose one of the other diagnoses as the secondary diagnosis. However, if both diagnoses are clearly related to a single target group it is not necessary to list both of them on the functional screen. For example, a 74-year-old man needs assistance with getting into the shower due to right-sided weakness after a cerebral vascular accident (CVA). The diagnosis that corresponds to why he needs assistance is a CVA. If he also has a diagnosis of right hemiparesis (right-sided weakness) due to the CVA, while the diagnosis of right hemiparesis could be selected as secondary, it is not required because it is actually caused by the identified primary diagnosis and it clearly relates to the same target group. If the need for assistance is due to multiple diagnoses that are related to different target groups, the screener should select diagnoses from different categories on the Diagnoses Table. This is important for accurate assignment of target group(s). For example, a 43-year-old woman needs hands-on assistance with bathing due to obesity (B8) and cueing with bathing due to intellectual disability (A1). In this example, both the obesity and intellectual disability diagnoses should be selected; one from the drop-down menu under primary diagnosis and one from the drop-down menu under secondary diagnosis. The diagnosis of obesity is relevant to the Physical Disability target group and the diagnosis of intellectual disability is relevant to the Intellectual/Developmental Disability target group. A review of Module 2 Target Groups can provide some guidance as to what factors into each target group. Mental Health Diagnoses: For a mental illness to be selected as a primary or secondary diagnosis that causes a need for assistance or support from another person, the person must have a permanent impairment of thought due to a severe and persistent mental illness. A screener should always consider if the diagnosis creates a permanent cognitive impairment that cannot be controlled by medications or therapy, is not situational, or varying to the degree that the person can complete the task another time. In the notes, the screener should clearly state what it is about the diagnosis that makes it permanent and not able to be overcome to complete the task. A cognitive impairment in the LTCFS is defined as a permanent impairment of thought due to a severe and persistent mental illness, dementia, brain injury, intellectual/developmental disability, or other organic brain disorder. - A cognitive impairment does not include temporary impairment due to medications and/or substance use intoxication. - A cognitive impairment does not include temporary impairment due to a temporary medical condition such as infection, electrolyte imbalance, or dehydration. Exception to Physical, Cognitive, or Memory Loss Impairment requirement There are occasions when the need for assistance is not due to a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment. This is relevant only to certain skilled tasks captured on the HRS Table (Module 7) and IADL Medication Administration and Medication Management (Module 5.14). These skilled tasks may include Medication Administration, Medication Management, Ostomy-related Skilled Services, Oxygen and/or Respiratory Treatments, Dialysis, Transfusions, Tracheostomy care, Ulcer care, Urinary Catheter-related skilled tasks, Other Wound Cares, Ventilator-related interventions, RNAI, and Skilled Therapies. In these cases, the screener should determine why a primary or secondary diagnosis is selected even though it may not be the cause of a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment requiring assistance from another person. The screener must document this in the Notes section. Examples include (this is not an all-inclusive list): - A person who is paralyzed from the waist down has a stage 4 ulcer on their coccyx region requiring dressing changes every three days. He has no physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment preventing him from performing the wound care, but due to the location of the ulcer, he is unable to complete the needed care. In addition, due to the depth of the wound, the physician has ordered a wound care nurse to complete the wound care. The screener would select K4: Wound/Burn/Bedsore/Pressure Ulcer as the primary diagnosis for Ulcer - Stage 3 or 4 on the HRS Table and explain in the Notes section why this selection was made. - A person has a verified diagnosis of chronic pain treated with a Fentanyl patch. The patch is placed on her back, near the scapula, and the site is changed every three days. She does not have a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment, but cannot reach the site, and she requests assistance to place and remove the patch. The screener needs to confirm with the person or her medical professional if the patch must be placed in a location that she cannot reach, or if an alternate, accessible, location is possible. If the location of the patch does indeed need to be in an inaccessible spot, the screener would select D12: Other Chronic Pain or Fatigue as the primary diagnosis for Medication Administration and explain in the Notes section why this selection was made. - A person has a verified diagnosis of end-stage kidney disease and receives hemodialysis three times a week at a dialysis center. His need for assistance at a dialysis center is not due to a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment. The screener would select G1: Renal Failure, other Kidney Disease as the primary diagnosis for Dialysis on the HRS Table and explain in the Notes section why this selection was made. 7.11 Behaviors Requiring Interventions Definition: Due to a cognitive impairment, the person exhibits the behavior of wandering, a self-injurious behavior, or an offensive or violent behavior to others, and a behavior plan is needed to either prevent the behavior or intervene when the behavior is exhibited. To record a need for assistance with Behaviors Requiring Interventions, the person's cognitive impairment needs to cause the behavior. A cognitive impairment on the HRS Table includes impairment of thought due to a severe and persistent mental illness, dementia, brain injury, intellectual/developmental disability, or other organic brain disorder. It does not include temporary impairment due to substance use intoxication. Preventions or interventions on the HRS Table include, but are not limited to: - Having someone (e.g., helper, family member, etc.) present to prevent the person from exhibiting the behavior. - Redirecting the person when they exhibit the behavior. - Physically preventing the person from exhibiting the behavior. - Monitoring the person when they exhibit the behavior. - Responding to problems caused by the person's behavior. To record a behavior on the HRS Table, all of the following criteria must be present: - Person has a cognitive impairment. - Interventions are required from another person. - A behavior plan to prevent or respond to the behavior. A behavior plan can be developed by a psychiatrist, psychologist, behavioral specialist, interdisciplinary team, or the individual's family. These plans typically involve the use of professional or non-professional caregivers. They are typically formal, written, behavior plans, but can include an informal behavior plan if everyone working with the individual is well aware of how to prevent the behavior or how to intervene when the behavior is exhibited. The following lists contain common, illustrative examples of behaviors related to when the selection of a need for assistance may or may not be warranted with a wandering, self-injurious, or offensive or violent behavior. The listed examples are not all-inclusive examples. Wandering on the HRS Table, for a person with a cognitive impairment, is defined as unsafe leaving or attempting to leave an immediate area (residence, community setting, workplace, etc.) without informing others and doing so requires intervention. A person may still exhibit wandering behavior even if elopement is impossible due to preventative measures, such as facility security systems, bed and wheelchair alarms, etc. Check this for a person who, due to a cognitive impairment: - Wanders and requires a behavior plan to either prevent the behavior or to intervene when the behavior is exhibited. - Only wanders and requires a behavior plan when in new situations, but does not wander in their routine and familiar situations. - Elopes or attempts to elope from their residence and requires a behavior plan. Regardless of whether a person has a cognitive impairment, do NOT check this for a person who: - Purposefully tries to leave their immediate area (residence, community setting, workplace, etc.). Examples can include, but are not limited to, when a person without a cognitive impairment keeps trying to elope, when the person no longer want to live at their residence, or the person has court-ordered services. - Keeps trying to, or does, leave their residence in order to use alcohol or other substances. - Paces within their residence due to anxiety, nervousness, or boredom. - Roams within their residence but does not require intervention(s). For example, a person may roam about their residential facility by going room to room, but does not try to elope from the facility. - Has a sleep disorder (e.g., sleepwalks, sleep talks, etc.). - Has as the only response in their behavior plan that someone call 911 for emergency assistance. - Is given a PRN (as needed) medication as the only intervention in the person's behavior plan. A Self-injurious Behavior on the HRS Table, for a person with a cognitive impairment, is defined as a behavior that causes, or is likely to cause, injury to one's own body and requires intervention. Self-injurious behaviors are physical self-abuse and do not include the absence of self-care or behaviors that may have unhealthy consequences. Check this for a person who, due to a cognitive impairment: - Exhibits self-abuse that causes, or is likely to cause, self-injury (e.g., hitting, biting, head banging, etc.). - Eats inedible objects (i.e., person has Pica). - Has excessive thirst manifested by excessive fluid intake (e.g., person has polydipsia). - Engages in non-suicidal self-injury that requires intervention (e.g., person cuts their skin). Regardless of whether a person has a cognitive impairment, do NOT check this for a person who: - Smokes, uses alcohol or other substances, or misuses medications (legal or illegal). - Is sexually promiscuous. - Has unprotected sex. - Makes poor eating choices given their physical health. Examples can include, but are not limited to, a person who eats a diet high in sugar content although they have insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or a person who does not follow their recommended low-fat diet. - Has a habit that is harmless and is unlikely to offend others. An example can include, but is not limited to, a person who displays a repetitive activity (e.g., repetitive tapping, rocking, or finger waving). - Has or seeks multiple body tattoos or piercings. - Rubs their skin or picks at their skin or scabs without the need for medical intervention beyond applying a Band-Aid. - Recently attempted suicide, has a history of attempting suicide, or has suicidal ideation. These actions or thoughts would be captured in the [Behaviors/Mental Health Module](/functionalscreen/ltcfs/instructions9.htm). - Has anorexia or bulimia-related behaviors. - Has a self-managed plan that does not require that intervention is initiated from another person and it is a self-help plan of action to prevent self-injurious behavior or steps for the individual to take in response to displaying a self-injurious behavior. A person self-managing their plan is not a type of behavior plan to record on the HRS Table. - Has as the only response in their behavior plan that someone call 911 for emergency assistance. - Is given a PRN (as needed) medication as the only intervention in the person's behavior plan. An Offensive or Violent Behavior to Others on the HRS Table is defined, for a person with a cognitive impairment, as a behavior that causes, or can reasonably be expected to cause, discomfort, distress to others, or threatens to cause emotional or physical harm to another person. The disturbing behavior impacts others in the person's community, including other residents in a facility, neighbors, or other people in the community at-large and requires a behavior plan to either prevent the behavior or intervene when the behavior is exhibited. Check this for a person who, due to a cognitive impairment: - Disrobes or masturbates in front of others. - Engages in inappropriate touching or sexual advances towards others. - Spits at or on others. - Routinely places their nasal mucous on another person or on places within their residence. - Routinely smears their fecal matter or spreads their urine on themselves, another person, or on places within their residence. - Urinates or defecates on another person or in inappropriate places. - Screams incessantly. - Uses profanity in conversation that is offensive and threatening to the point where law enforcement would be contacted to intervene. - Verbally and physically threatens others, including, but not limited to, aggressive gestures or a raised fist, to the point where law enforcement would typically be contacted to intervene. - Tortures, maims, or otherwise abuses animals. - Strikes out at or strikes, kicks, bites, or otherwise batters others. - Commits or has a history of sexual aggression, pedophilia, or arson, and the behavior continues to be an active concern. Regardless of whether a person has a cognitive impairment, do NOT check this for a person who: - Uses profanity in conversation that is not offensive or threatening to the point where law enforcement would typically be contacted to intervene. - Uses swear words or racial slurs on a routine basis. - Hoards items. - Has poor housecleaning skills or practices. - Steals items. - Has poor personal hygiene. Examples can include, but are not limited to, a person with excessive body odor, including a person with a strong urine or fecal odor. - Is uncooperative with a task. - Enters another person's living space (e.g., person is a \"busy body\"). - Has a difficult personality. Examples can include, but are not limited to, a person who is obstinate, vulgar, ill-tempered, or doesn't get along with their family members or caregivers. - Exhibits behavior that may indicate a need for medical treatment, mental health treatment, or substance use treatment, but does not require an intervention. Examples can include, but are not limited to, a person with an anxiety disorder who needs frequent reassuring, or a person with an obsessive compulsive disorder who repeatedly checks if the door is locked. - By appearance or mannerisms may elicit social prejudices, such as avoidance or stigmatization. Examples can include, but are not limited to, a person who mutters, talks to themselves, makes noises, has body tics, or has Tourette's syndrome. - Vaguely threatens others. An example can include, but is not limited to, a person who says, \"Somebody's going to pay.\" - Has a self-managed plan that does not require that intervention is initiated from another person and it is a self-help plan of action to prevent offensive or violent behavior to others or steps for the individual to take in response to displaying a self-injurious behavior. A person self-managing their plan is not a type of behavior plan to record on the HRS Table. - Has as the only response in their behavior plan that someone call 911 for emergency assistance. - Is given a PRN (as needed) medication as the only intervention in the person's behavior plan. REMINDER: On the HRS Table, to select a need for assistance with a Behavior Requiring Interventions, the individual must have a cognitive impairment, while Self-injurious Behaviors and Offensive or Violent Behaviors in [Module 9, Behaviors/Mental Health](/functionalscreen/ltcfs/instructions9.htm), do not. Screeners should review both sections to ensure the individual's needs have been accurately recorded. How to Determine the Frequency: Use of the \"Person is Independent\" column is not an option for the Behaviors Requiring Interventions row. If the person needs assistance from another person, select the frequency column according to the guidelines in Module 7.5-7.9. 7.12 Exercises/Range of Motion Definition: This row addresses the performance of physical exercise or range of motion exercises, completed in the person's residence, to restore or maintain physical capabilities when the person is at risk for loss of function due to a related health condition. The person may perform these exercises themselves or family or staff may help perform them. The exercise program may or may not have been set up by a rehabilitation therapist and helpers may or may not have been trained by the therapist. Check this for a person who: - Engages in a routine of therapeutic exercise to restore or prevent loss of physical function. For example, after a stroke a person may receive range of motion exercises to their affected side, three times a day, to regain joint or muscle function; or a person may receive stretching or motion exercises to treat contractures. - Completes prescribed physical therapy exercises, although no longer receiving formal physical therapy. - Receives occupational therapy (OT), physical therapy (PT), or speech-language pathology (SLP) from someone other than a licensed OT, PT, or SLP. This includes exercises completed with a family member, someone significant in the person's life, caregiver, physical therapy assistant, or an occupational therapy assistant, even if under the instructions of an OT, PT, or SLP. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Completes exercises with a rehabilitation therapist (i.e., a physical therapist, occupational therapist, or speech-language pathologist). This is captured in Module 7.31 Skilled Therapies. - Engages in basic fitness exercise (e.g., walking, weight lifting). - Goes to a gym or pool to exercise. - Participates in an exercise class. - Participates in cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation outside their residence. How to Determine the Frequency: Use the \"Person is Independent\" column if the person completes their Exercises/Range of Motion without help from another person. If the individual needs assistance, select the applicable \"Frequency of Help/Services Needed from Other Persons\" column according to the guidelines in Module 7.5-7.9. 7.13 IV Medications, Fluids, or IV Line Flushes Definition: \"IV\" is an abbreviation for the word \"intravenous\" and pertains to medications, fluids, or flushes delivered into a vein. This may consist of an IV injection or IV infusion. Most common are small bags of antibiotics that \"drip\" in (usually via an IV pump for safety) and can include a PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter) line or a central line. Check this for a person who: - Receives IV medications, IV fluids, or IV line flushes that are provided in their residence. - Requires IV medication, like an antibiotic to drip into their vein to treat a serious infection. IV medications usually drip in over 30 to 60 minutes. - Requires IV fluids because they are unable to consume enough liquids and are dehydrated. Typically these fluids consist of saline or weak solutions of dextrose given in response to acute dehydration or until tube feeding can be established. - Requires their IV to be flushed, which means the IV is irrigated or washing out with a sterile solution or medication, and IV flushing is the only IV intervention being provided. On the HRS Table, do not record the task of IV flushing separately if it's part of one intervention that combines several tasks (e.g., starting the medication, flushing, and disconnecting). When a person only needs assistance with their IV Medications, do not also record a need for assistance on the Medication Administration and Medication Management rows. - Requires site cares to be provided, such as cleaning and re-bandaging the IV site. Site care is typically completed every few days. Do NOT check this for a person who receives: - IV services provided outside their residence (e.g., in a primary care setting, such as a clinic). - Chemotherapy treatments outside of their residence. - Intramuscular (IM) injections or subcutaneous injections (an injection into the layer between the skin and muscle). - Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) or Transfusions, which have separate HRS Table rows, unless they receive either of those specific HRS tasks (see Module 7.20 and 7.21). How to Determine the Frequency: Skilled IV interventions are often provided in combination with several tasks over a few minutes. The HRS Table should reflect the number of times per day, week, or month the cluster of tasks must be completed. To determine the frequency of IV interventions, combine the tasks that can be completed within an hour and multiply by the number of times per day (or week or month) that the cluster of tasks must be completed. The following illustrative examples are not an all-inclusive list: 1 - 2 times/day examples: - An IV medication is prescribed to drip in over 30 to 60 minutes. The nurse arrives, ensures the IV catheter is patent (unblocked), hooks up the IV tubing, drips in the IV antibiotic, follows that with a bit of IV fluid, then disconnects the tubing and administers a small heparin flush to keep the line open. All of these skilled tasks take the nurse about one hour to complete. All of this counts as one time per day assistance with the person's IV and the screener should select the \"1-2 times/day\" frequency of assistance needed from another person. - The person receives an IV infusion throughout the night. There is one cluster of skilled IV tasks to start the infusion at bedtime, and another cluster of skilled tasks to disconnect it and flush the line each morning. The two separate clusters of skilled tasks make \"1-2 times/day\" the correct frequency of assistance needed from another person. - The person has an IV line, but is not currently receiving any fluids or medications through it and in order to prevent the line from clotting off, a small flush of heparin is administered into the IV twice daily. This is a skilled task that occurs twice daily and makes the selection of \"1-2 times/day\" the correct frequency of assistance needed from another person. 3 - 4 times/day examples: - Same as the once per day example in the first bullet above, except the IV medication is administered three times per day. Thus, there are three separate clusters of IV tasks (assessing patency, hooking up tubing, administering medication, disconnecting tubing, and flushing the IV) all completed within an hour, three separate times per day and makes the selection of \"3-4 times/day\" the correct frequency of assistance needed from another person. - The person has a continuous drip of IV fluid. Family caregivers have learned how to work the IV pump and how to add a full IV bag three times per day, and what problems to report to the nurse. The nurse starts a new IV in another vein (to reduce infection) every three days. The screener would select the highest frequency of interventions, which makes the selection of \"3-4 times/day\" the correct frequency of assistance needed from another person. 2 to 6 times/week examples: - Several days of IV medications can be put into a computerized pump that delivers the medication slowly or intermittently and prevents the IV from clotting off. The pump only needs to be refilled and re-programmed every three days or so. In between refills (aka, set-ups), the IV stays hooked up and there are no IV tasks to be done; it works fine and the person or caregivers know how to handle and/or report problems. The frequency of assistance needed from another person with these IV medications is \"2-6 times/week,\" to record the IV set up assistance needed every 2 to 3 days. - Other skilled IV tasks that usually occur once every three days are: - Changing the IV dressing. - Starting a new IV in a new place (to reduce risk of infection in \"peripheral\" IVs in the person's hand or forearm). 7.14 Medication Administration (not IV) or Assistance with Pre-Selected or Set-Up Medications Definition of a medication: A medication is a drug used to treat disease, symptoms, or injury that enters the body in the prescribed manner. The type of medications prescribed for the person can be brand name, generic, or over-the-counter (OTC). A medication on the LTCFS must meet these three criteria: - Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. - Prescribed by a Medicaid-recognized prescriber, such as a physician, psychiatrist, nurse practitioner, physician's assistant, optometrist, or dentist. - Regularly scheduled and used. PRN Medications: A PRN medication is a medication taken only when needed based on symptoms and typically PRN medications are not captured on the LTCFS. In order for a PRN medication to be captured on the LTCFS, it must meet the definition of a Medication as described above and be used as stated here: - Regularly scheduled and used at minimum once a month every month. Examples include: - Pain medicine that is ordered PRN but taken every four to six hours, every day. - Skin cream that is ordered PRN but applied every week. - A medication to relieve menstrual symptoms, such as Midol, that is ordered PRN but used once every month. - Sliding scale insulin (where the exact dosage is adjusted according to the blood glucose level) can be treated as a regularly scheduled medication, because it is regularly given, with the dose merely adjusted to blood glucose level. The following are not considered Medications on the LTCFS: - PRN medications that do not meet the definition of a medication. - Vitamin (unless injected for example, vitamin B-12 injections), mineral, supplement, and alternative or complementary medicines, even if prescribed by a Medicaid-recognized prescriber. Non-vitamin, non-mineral natural substances such as, omega 3 or fish oil, glucosamine, ginkgo, anti-oxidants, ginseng, echinacea, chondroitin, coenzyme seed, milk thistle, lutein, barkwater, or shark cartilage, even if prescribed by a Medicaid-recognized prescriber. - Other complementary or alternative medicines, such as homeopathic, naturopathic, or herbal therapy; or other treatment such as aromatherapy, flower remedies, crystal or magnet therapy, chelation, bowel cleansing, detoxifier, acupuncture, or acupressure. - Other dietary supplements with calories, minerals, vitamins, and/or other additives. In the IADLs, Medication Administration and Medication Management are coded together. This differs from the HRS Table where Medication Administration and Medication Management are coded separately. The LTCFS application will check to ensure that the level of help indicated in the IADL Medication Administration and Medication Management correlates with the Medication Administration and Medication Management tasks on the HRS Table. If the level of help does not correlate between that IADL task and the Medication Administration and Medication Management tasks on the HRS Table, the screener will receive an error message to prompt review. Definition of Medication Administration: A person's need for assistance from another person to take or be given a medication by any route except intravenously (IV). This could be by mouth, tongue, injection, onto or into the body, rectally, vaginally, by feeding tube, or by inhaler. Common forms of medications include but are not limited to tablet, capsule, liquid, drops, and skin preparations. The person's need for assistance from another person in order to use a prescribed medication that is regularly scheduled and used should be captured here. The preparation of medications, such as crushing a tablet to be diluted or measuring to fill a syringe or dosage cup, may be considered Medication Administration when it is prepared within one hour of when the dose is to be taken. Excluded are: - IV medications. This need is captured in Module 7.13 IV Medications, Fluids, or Line Flushes - Topical medications used for ulcer, wound care. This need is captured in Modules 7.24 Ulcer - Stage 2, 7.25 Ulcer - Stage 3 or 4, or 7.27 Other Wound Cares - Medications used for nebulizer treatments. This need is captured in Module 7.18 Oxygen and/or Respiratory Treatments. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Has no medications. - Does not take regularly scheduled medication but needs assistance from another person with an infrequently taken prescription PRN medication (taken less than once a month every month. Such a PRN medication does not meet the LTCFS definition of a medication. Refer to the PRN Medication definition. - Chooses not to take any medications (the person is declining the task of taking medications itself). If the individual has declined to complete the health-related service or task itself, and is able to perceive and recognize the potential risk or negative health outcome that could result from declining the task, the screener should leave the default selection of \"N/A.\" In this situation, the person has no need for assistance with the health-related service or task because the health-related service or task is not occurring. - If the person is not able to perceive and recognize the potential risk or negative health outcome that could result from declining the task, the screener should select the frequency of need. - If a person has a legal guardian, an activated power of attorney for health care, or is currently involved with adult protective services, that person may be considered not able to perceive and recognize potential risks or negative health outcomes, and the selection of a need might be appropriate. Check \"Person is independent\" for a person who: - Has no physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment affecting his or her ability to complete the task of Medication Administration independently. - Is independent with Medication Administration with the use of simple, reasonable adaptations such as large-print or Braille labels, \"talking\" glucometer, easy-open pill bottles. - Has no physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment affecting his or her ability to complete the task of Medication Administration independently, but: - Prefers assistance with Medication Administration due only to a gender, age, or cultural norm. - Needs assistance with Medication Administration due only to a language barrier. - Needs assistance with Medication Administration due only to illiteracy. - Requires Medication Administration less often than monthly. - Is independent with Medication Administration and Medication Management as prescribed, and receives services outside his or her residence, such as - Has medication monitoring, including blood draws, done outside the person's residence such as at the physician's office, clinic, pharmacy, or health care facility. - Receives injections, such as vitamin B-12 or Depo-Provera, outside his/her residence such as at a clinic. - Takes medication through an intrathecal drug pump, also known as a pain pump or internal morphine pump, that requires only intermittent refills and maintenance in the clinic setting, but does not require monitoring in their residence. - Has a drug delivery implant such as the birth control implant, Implanon. - Is independent with Medication Administration and lives in a residential facility but does not administer their medications because medications are provided as part of the services in the facility where the person resides. - Is independent with Medication Administration, but due to the policy of the person's provider agency, such as hospice or a personal care provider, does not administer their medications because this is a service provided by the agency. - Is independent with Medication Administration and is left a written reminder from another person as a cue to take his or her medications. - Is independent with Medication Administration and is contacted by another person to check if the person has or has not taken his or her medication but the cueing or call is not needed. - Is independent with Medication Administration however requires assistance with the filling of a medication box. - Has a cognitive or memory loss impairment but takes medication as prescribed, without misuse or error, once the medication is set up. - Is independent with Medication Administration and only needs assistance getting food or drink needed to take their medications but takes their medications at meal times. - Is given medication by IV only. This need is captured in Module 7.13 IV Medications, Fluids, or Line Flushes. Check the appropriate frequency, using guidance provided under 7.5 Person is NOT Independent in Completing and Managing a Health-Related Service, for a person who: - Due to a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment requires supervision, cueing, and/or hands-on assistance with the task of Medication Administration. To code cueing assistance for a medication, the cue must be done within an hour of when the dose is to be taken. - Requires assistance with Medication Administration at the \"Check 1,\" \"Check 2a,\" or \"Check 2b\" frequency as on IADLs Medication Administration and Medication Management, Module 5.14. - Needs assistance to crush his or her medication or assistance to put his or her medication in food, such as applesauce, in order for it to be taken when it is prepared within one hour of when the dose is to be taken. - Needs assistance to prepare a medication for administration via a feeding tube. For example, crushing a tablet to be diluted and administered through a G-tube when it is prepared within one hour of when the dose is to be taken. - Has a cognitive impairment and has a court-ordered medication. - Needs someone to physically assist with the medication but is self-directing and has the cognitive ability to select the proper medication and dosage, and has the judgment to understand the medication's purpose, side effects, and report problems. An example of this is a person with quadriplegia who instructs his or her helper, \"Please put one of those three pills on my tongue and give me a drink.\" Exception to determining appropriate frequencies Check \"1-2 times/day\" for a person who: - Is independent with Medication Administration and only needs assistance getting food or drink, outside of Meal Preparation, needed to take their medication. How to Determine the Frequency: Use the \"Person is Independent\" column if the person can take all their medications without any help from another person. If they need assistance, select the applicable \"Frequency of Help/Services Needed from Other Person\" column according to the guidelines in Module 7.5 - 7.9. 7.15 Medication Management: Set-up and/or Monitoring Medications (for Effects, Side Effects, Adjustments, Pain Management) and/or Blood Levels Definition of a medication: See Module 7.14 above for the definition of a medication. In the IADLs, Medication Administration and Medication Management are coded together. This differs from the HRS Table where Medication Administration and Medication Management are coded separately. The LTCFS application will check to ensure that the level of help indicated in the IADL Medication Administration and Medication Management correlates with the Medication Administration and Medication Management tasks on the HRS Table. If the level of help does not correlate between that IADL task and the Medication Administration and Medication Management tasks on the HRS Table, the screener will receive an error message to prompt review. Definition of Medication Management: A person's need for assistance from another person to set up or monitor his or her prescribed and regularly scheduled and used medications. The two components of Medication Management include: 1.) Medication Set-up: To separate out the proper dosage and set it aside for later use by the individual. Medication set-up is completed for several reasons. One reason is to ensure the proper medication, at the proper dosage is selected when the individual is unable to select it due to a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment. Another reason is to arrange the medications to help the person remember to take them at proper times and to make it easier to tell that medications were or were not taken. Examples of medication set-ups: - Medication boxes with compartments labeled for different times and each day of the week, into which pills are placed. - Any other set-up system in which medications and dosages are pre-selected by another person, such as a bubble pack. - Automated medication dispensers, such as a CompuMed, that can be programmed (often weekly) to dispense pills. - Prefilling of syringes, such as insulin syringes. Medication set-ups are commonly used for convenience in organizing and remembering one's medications, even by people with no physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment. When a person uses a medication set-up, the screener needs to determine whether, due to a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment, the person needs to use the medication set-up, and/or needs the assistance of another person to fill it. The preparation of medications, such as crushing a tablet to be diluted or measuring to fill a syringe or dosage cup, may be considered Medication Management when it is NOT prepared within one hour of when the dose is to be taken. 2.) Medication Monitoring Medication monitoring includes the following components: - Due to a memory loss or cognitive impairment, oversight is required for monitoring of effects, side effects, or adjustments. This oversight is captured at a frequency of 1 to 3 times per month. - The need to collect medication-related data, as ordered by the prescriber, prior to administering a medication, such as blood glucose level, blood pressure, or heart rate, and that the data collection is occurring. - The need to collect medication-related data as ordered by the prescriber, such as vital signs, weights, seizure activity, or in-home assistance to draw blood for a lab test, and that the data collection is occurring and reported to a health care provider. Common reasons for a need for assistance with Medication Monitoring. This is not an all-inclusive list: - Uncontrolled Seizure Disorder. An individual's need for assistance in his or her residence from another person when the individual has an uncontrolled seizure disorder, evidenced by one or more seizures in the last three months, and medication is frequently adjusted. - Pain Management. An individual's need for assistance from another person to adjust his or her medications, in the individual's residence, in order to manage pain. This does not include care at a pain clinic or any other setting outside the person's residence. This also does not include prescription or OTC PRN medications that do not meet the definition of a medication as described at the beginning of this module. - Blood Levels. A person's need for assistance from another person to draw blood samples, in his or her residence, for laboratory tests. The majority of these tasks are related to medications, such as Pro-Times to regulate Coumadin administration or potassium levels for a person on diuretics. Blood levels also include \"finger-sticks\" for capillary blood to test blood glucose levels. If the person's condition is unstable and medication is frequently adjusted, then the need for medication monitoring may be several times per week or even daily. The condition or treatment may stabilize over time and then the frequency of medication monitoring would decrease. A rescreen should be completed when a person's condition stabilizes to reflect this and any other changes. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Has no medications. - Does not take regularly scheduled medication but needs assistance from another person with an infrequently taken prescription PRN medication (taken less than once a month every month). Such a PRN medication does not meet the LTCFS definition of a medication. Refer to the PRN Medication definition. - Chooses not to take any medications (the person is declining the task of taking medications itself). If the individual has declined the task of taking medications itself, and is able to perceive and recognize the potential risk or negative health outcome that could result from declining the task, the screener should select \"NA - Has no medications.\" In this situation, the person has no need for Medication Administration or Medication Management because it is not occurring. For example, if an individual able to perceive potential risk or negative outcome chooses not to take any prescribed medications, the person has no need for medication administration and medication management assistance because no medications are being taken (the task itself is not being done). - If the person is not able to perceive and recognize the potential risk or negative health outcome that could result from declining the task, the screener should select the frequency of need. - If a person has a legal guardian, an activated power of attorney for health care, or is currently involved with adult protective services, that person may be considered not able to perceive and recognize potential risks or negative health outcomes, and the selection of a need might be appropriate. Check \"Person is independent\" for a person who: - Has no physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment affecting his or her ability to complete the task of Medication Management independently. - Is independent with Medication Management with the use of simple, reasonable adaptations, such as large-print or Braille labels, \"talking\" glucometer, easy-open pill bottles. - Is independent with Medication Management and uses an alarm on their watch, clock, or phone as a reminder to take medications. - Is independent with Medication Management and uses an automated pill dispenser, such as CompuMed. - Has no physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment affecting his or her ability to complete the task of Medication Administration and Medication Management independently, but: - Prefers assistance with Medication Management due only to a gender, age, or cultural norm. - Needs assistance with Medication Management due only to a language barrier. - Needs assistance with Medication Management due only to illiteracy. - Requires Medication Management assistance less often than monthly. - Is independent with Medication Administration and Medication Management as prescribed, and receives services outside his or her residence, such as: - Has medication monitoring, including blood draws, done outside the person's residence, such as at the physician's office, clinic, pharmacy, or health care facility. - Receives injections, such as vitamin B-12 or Depo-Provera, outside his or her residence such as at a clinic. - Takes medication through an intrathecal drug pump, also known as a pain pump or internal morphine pump, that requires only intermittent refills and maintenance in the clinic setting, but does not require monitoring in their residence. - Has a drug delivery implant, such as the birth control implant, Implanon. - Is independent with Medication Management and takes medication as prescribed and is able to contact the prescriber with concerns and understands the prescriber's recommendations. - Is independent with Medication Management and takes medication as prescribed and is able to independently collect medication-related data, such as blood glucose levels, blood pressure, weights, pulse. - Is independent with Medication Management and independently sets up and uses his or her medication box. - Is independent with Medication Management and uses a medication box as a convenience. - Is independent with Medication Management and has an unorthodox system of organizing medications, but has no history of medication misuse or errors. - Is independent with Medication Management; however, a lock box is used. - Due to the policy of their provider agency (for example, a hospice agency or a personal care provider agency). - To prevent another person or pet from having access to the medication. - Solely due to suicidal ideation or substance use issues. - Due to taking their medication other than as prescribed. - Is independent with Medication Management; however, needs assistance to prevent someone else, including a pet, from having access to the medication. - Is independent with Medication Administration and Medication Management but needs assistance reordering or obtaining medication refills. This includes assistance to arrange for a medication refill, such as a request to the pharmacy. This need is captured in Module 5.16 Laundry and/or Chores. - Is independent with Medication Administration and Medication Management but requires transportation to the pharmacy. This need is captured in Module 5.18 Transportation. - Is independent with Medication Management and lives in a residential facility but does not manage their medications because medications are provided as part of the services in the facility where the person resides. - Is independent with Medication Management, lives in a residential facility, and on a regular basis receives routine monitoring for general health, behavior, etc., by the person's agency's staff because that monitoring is provided to all residents. - Is independent with Medication Management but due to the policy of the person's provider agency, such as hospice or a personal care provider, does not manage their medications because this is a service provided by the agency. - Does not have a cognitive or memory loss impairment and the person cannot name each of his or her medications but can tell you what health issues he or she takes the medication for. Examples include but are not limited to when a person cannot name his or her hypertension medication, such as hydrochlorothiazide, but can tell you, \"That little yellow pill is my water pill. I have high blood pressure.\" Or, they can tell you, \"I take a pill once a week for my osteoporosis\" when they are prescribed alendronate. - Is independent with Medication Management and takes a medication that only comes preselected from the manufacturer, such as birth control pills, some antibiotics, some steroids, or insulin in dispensing pens. Check the appropriate frequency, using guidance provided under 7.5 Person is NOT Independent in Completing and Managing a Health-Related Service, for a person who: - Due to a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment requires supervision, cueing, and/or hands-on assistance with the task of Medication Management. - Requires assistance with Medication Management at the \"Check 1,\" \"Check 2a,\" or \"Check 2b\" frequency as on IADL Medication Administration and Medication Management Module 5.14. - Needs assistance to crush his or her medication or assistance to put his or her medication in food, such as applesauce, in order for it to be taken when it is NOT prepared within one hour of when the dose is to be taken. - Needs assistance to check his or her blood glucose level or to adjust his or her insulin dose given the current blood glucose level. - Needs assistance to prepare a medication for administration via a feeding tube. For example, crushing a tablet to be diluted and administered through a G-tube when it is NOT prepared within one hour of when the dose is to be taken. - Has an unstable condition and medication is frequently adjusted and the person needs someone to monitor him or her for specific medication effects and side effects and report those to the prescriber. - Has cognitive impairment and has a court-ordered medication. - Requires assistance with a medication delivered subcutaneous with a pump, such as an insulin pump. - Due to a cognitive or memory loss impairment, needs someone to assist with the medication because is not self-directing, does not have the cognitive ability to select the proper medication and dosage, and lacks the judgment to understand the medications' purpose, side effects, and report problems. Exception to determining appropriate frequencies: Check \"weekly\" for a person who: - Only requires assistance with prefilling insulin syringes, as they can typically be completed weekly, since prefilled syringes can be stored in the refrigerator for a week. This task should be indicated at the \"Check 1\" frequency on IADL Medication Administration and Medication Management. - Only requires assistance with measuring medication from a larger container to a smaller dosage cup as this can typically be completed weekly. This task should be indicated at the \"Check 1\" frequency on IADL Medication Administration and Medication Management. Check \"1-3 times/month\" for a person who: - Is independent with Medication Administration; however, requires assistance with the filling of a medication box. Medication boxes are typically filled at the \"1 to 3 times/month\" frequency, since two or more medication boxes can be prefilled at one time. If this usual method does not work well for an individual, more frequent medication set-up may be necessary. - Has a cognitive or memory loss impairment but takes medication as prescribed, without misuse or error, once the medication is set up. - Only requires oversight due to a memory loss or cognitive impairment for monitoring of effects, side effects, or adjustments. This oversight is captured at a frequency of \"Check 1\" frequency on IADL Medication Administration and Medication Management. How to Determine the Frequency: Use the \"Person is Independent\" column if the person can manage all of their medication without any help from another person. If they need assistance from another person with any of the Medication Management activities, select the frequency column according to the guidelines in Module 7.5-7.9. The following section provides examples of when to use the Medication Administration and/or Medication Management rows on the HRS Table. - CASE #1: Use the Medication Administration column to capture when a person is independent with their insulin injections. If the person is completing their own blood glucose level checks, you would also select in the \"Person is Independent\" row for Medication Management. - CASE #2: If the person is independent with their insulin, but needs someone else to set up their pills, you would select the \"Person is Independent\" row for Medication Administration, to reflect that they take their own insulin and pills. In the row for Medication Management you would select the frequency at which someone must set up the pills. This is typically completed 1-3 times per month. 7.16 Ostomy-Related Skilled Services Definition: An ostomy is a surgically created opening through the skin into an organ for the discharge of body wastes. Use of the row reflects that skilled tasks are being provided to an ostomy site or opening. Ostomies are named for the organs they access\u2014for instance, colostomy (into the colon or large intestine), ileostomy (into the end of the small intestine), cystostomy (into the bladder), or urostomy (into the urinary tract). Unskilled tasks related to an ostomy, to EXCLUDE from the HRS Table include: - Emptying the ostomy bag. - Reconnecting the bag to the wafer (which is attached to skin). - Site care consisting of just soap and water, or application of gauze to intact skin. - Irrigation of bowel ostomy (similar to enema), in a well-functioning ostomy (one that has been in place for more than four weeks). Skilled tasks related to an ostomy to INCLUDE on the HRS Table: - Changing the wafer (which adheres to the skin and needs to be cut to the proper size to avoid skin breakdown around the ostomy). For a stable ostomy, the wafer is typically changed once every 7 to 10 days. - Special skin care and application of a wafer for a new ostomy (one that has been in place for less than four weeks), or for a leaky, excoriated (raw), or infected ostomy site. - Irrigation of new ostomy (one that has been in for place less than four weeks) or one that is functioning poorly. Check this for a person who: - Needs assistance with an ostomy-related skilled task listed above. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Needs assistance with an ostomy-related skilled services provided outside their residence (i.e., in a primary care setting such as a clinic). - Only needs assistance with an unskilled ostomy-related task. - Has someone checking/monitoring the ostomy, but the ostomy site has been problem-free. - Has a drainage tube from a wound or their chest cavity. This type of tube is not considered an ostomy for the purposes of the HRS Table and related care needs should be captured on the Other row (see Module 7.30). - Has a tracheostomy. Assistance with tracheostomy-related care is captured on the Tracheostomy Care row (see Module 7.22). How to Determine the Frequency: Use the \"Person is Independent\" column if the person can manage their Ostomy-related Skilled Services without any help from another person. If they need assistance, select the frequency of the task completed most often and according to the guidelines in Module 7.5-7.9. 7.17 Positioning in Bed or Chair Every 2-3 Hours Definition: Moving a person to redistribute pressure applied to their body. Changing a person's position is a precautionary measure to help prevent bedsores and pneumonia. Check this for a person who: - Needs to be repositioned by another person at least every 2-3 hours, in a bed or chair. - Requires assistance with repositioning from another person to adjust their tilt-in-space wheelchair. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Can independently reposition themselves with or without a repositioning device (e.g., bed trapeze, bed rail, tilt-in-space wheelchair). - Needs assistance to be repositioned less than 3 times/day. - Needs a verbal prompt to cue them to reposition themselves. - Can independently reposition themselves with an alternating pressure mattress or wheelchair pad. How to Determine the Frequency: There are only two frequency options, \"3-4 times a day\" or \"5+ times a day.\" If the person is positioned by another person every day, select the column that best describes the frequency. Tip: The LTCFS application will check to ensure the level of help indicated in the Bathing, Dressing, Mobility, Toileting, and Transferring ADLs correlates with the Positioning in bed or chair task on the HRS Table. If the level of help does not correlate between those ADL tasks and the Positioning task, the screener will receive an error message to prompt correction. 7.18 and/or Respiratory Treatments: Tracheal inhalers) Definition: Use this row to reflect the use of oxygen or provision of skilled tasks related to the respiratory treatments as defined below: Oxygen is provided from tanks of compressed gas or from an oxygen concentrator. Oxygen flow (usually 1 to 3 liters/minute) is adjusted by turning a dial to a specified number. Oxygen is delivered to a person through tubing connected to a nasal cannula (2 short plastic prongs at nostrils) or to a mask to the nose, nose and mouth, or a tracheostomy. The tubing often runs through a bottle of distilled water to humidify the oxygen. Unskilled tasks related to oxygen to EXCLUDE from the HRS Table: - Connecting, cleaning, or changing oxygen tubing, masks, bottles, etc. - Refilling the humidifier bottle. - Refilling portable oxygen tanks. - Moving the tank/compressor and/or the tubing from room to room. - Reporting equipment problems, reordering supplies, or reordering oxygen, if the tank(s) gets low, with the oxygen vendor. - Ensuring oxygen safety (no sparks or flames nearby). - The oxygen vendor's services. Skilled tasks related to oxygen to INCLUDE on the HRS Table: - Placing or removing the nasal cannula or mask. - Starting the oxygen or adjusting the flow rate based on the person's respiratory status. - Applying and using a pulse oximetry (which measures blood oxygen levels). - Providing skilled interventions in response to low blood oxygen (adjusting oxygen flow, repositioning, cueing pursed-lipped deep breathing, etc.) in an acutely unstable condition. Suctioning is completed when the person is unable to cough up their own secretions. Unskilled tasks related to suctioning to EXCLUDE from the HRS Table: - Suctioning only in the mouth (or nostrils). - Cleaning or replacing the tubing or equipment. Skilled tasks related to suctioning to INCLUDE on the HRS Table: - \"Deep\" suctioning into trachea/windpipe. Bi-PAP and C-PAP machines are noninvasive devices that provide continuous or bi-level positive airway pressure, provided via a mask to open the airways and improve oxygenation of the lungs. A person typically only uses a C-PAP or Bi-PAP during sleep. A C-PAP or Bi-PAP is a small electric machine with specific pressure settings and alarm settings, a reservoir for distilled water, and tubing to a mask over the nose or over nose and mouth. Unskilled tasks related to use of a C-PAP or Bi-PAP to EXCLUDE from the HRS Table: - Connecting, cleaning, or changing the tubing, mask, bottle, etc. - Refilling the humidifier bottle. Skilled tasks related to use of a C-PAP or Bi-PAP to INCLUDE on the HRS Table: - Placing or removing the C-PAP or Bi-PAP mask. - Initiating use of the Bi-PAP or C-PAP (starting the machine, ensuring pressures and alarms are correctly set) at night, for nap, or as needed. Nebulizer: This is a machine that uses pressurized air to turn liquid medication into a fine mist for inhalation. The medication usually comes in a pre-measured plastic vial; the vial top is twisted off, the medication squirted into a plastic chamber, the chamber attached to the tubing, and the tubing attached to the machine and the mouthpiece or mask. The machine is turned on to create an airflow that delivers the medication as a mist the person breathes in through a mouthpiece or a mask, usually over 5 to 10 minutes. Unskilled tasks related to use of a nebulizer to EXCLUDE from the HRS Table: - Cleaning or changing the tubing or mask. - Bringing someone their nebulizer when they need to use it. Skilled tasks related to use of a nebulizer to INCLUDE on the HRS Table: - Administering a medicated nebulizer treatment. Cough Assist Device (e.g., an In-Exsufflator Machine): Helps to clear airway secretions in people unable to cough on their own. It is a machine that creates a few seconds of strong pre-set airflow pressures through tubes to a mask over the mouth and nose. The machine applies inward pressure during inspiration and negative pressure (sucking) to pull secretions out. Treatments are usually done several times daily. Unskilled tasks related to use of a cough assist device to EXCLUDE from the HRS Table: - Connecting, cleaning, or changing the tubing or mask. Skilled tasks related to use of a cough assist device to include on the HRS Table: - Administering a cough assist treatment. IPPB Treatments: \"IPPB\" is an abbreviation for intermittent positive pressure breathing. An IPPB machine provides short-term mechanical ventilation to expand the lungs, deliver aerosol medication, or assist ventilation. Unskilled tasks related to IPPB Treatments to EXCLUDE from the HRS Table: - Connecting, cleaning, or changing the tubing or mask. Skilled tasks related to IPPB Treatments to INCLUDE on the HRS Table: - Administering an IPPB treatment. Chest physiotherapy (CPT), chest percussion and postural drainage (P/PD), or use of a percussive vest are all ways to physically loosen secretions in the lungs and move them into major airways where they can be coughed and/or suctioned out. They involve cupped-hand clapping on or vibration of the chest wall and back; the percussive vest is a machine replacement of a person doing it. These treatments are likely to be prescribed several times per day during acute pneumonia in someone unable to cough on their own or daily for someone with cystic fibrosis. Unskilled tasks related to CPT, P/PD, or use of a percussive vest to EXCLUDE from the HRS Table: - Connecting, cleaning, or changing the tubing or mask. Skilled task related to CPT, P/PD, or use of a percussive vest to INCLUDE on the HRS Table: - Administering any of these treatments. Check this for a person who: - Needs assistance with a skilled task listed above in order to use oxygen or receive a respiratory treatment as defined above. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Needs assistance with an unskilled task listed above in order to use oxygen or receive a respiratory treatment. - Uses oxygen independently and the screener selects the frequency of help needed from another person at 1-3 times/month to reflect the frequency of the oxygen vendor's trips (usually every few weeks) to provide new oxygen tanks. For this person, the frequency selection would be \"Person is Independent.\" - Uses a hand-held inhaler or aerosol, which has pre-metered doses. If the person needs help with those, that need for assistance is captured on the Medication Administration row. (See Module 7.14). - Needs to use a mechanical volume ventilator (see Module 7.28). - Needs cueing to not smoke when using oxygen. - Chooses not to use their respiratory treatment, such as CPAP or nebulizer (the person is declining the task itself). If the individual has declined to complete the health-related service or task itself, and is able to perceive and recognize the potential risk or negative health outcome that could result from declining the task, the screener should leave the default selection of \"N/A.\" In this situation, the person has no need for assistance with the health-related service or task because the health-related service or task is not occurring. - If the person is not able to perceive and recognize the potential risk or negative health outcome that could result from declining the task, the screener should select the frequency of need. - If a person has a legal guardian, an activated power of attorney for health care, or is currently involved with adult protective services, that person may be considered not able to perceive and recognize potential risks or negative health outcomes, and the selection of a need might be appropriate. - Is prescribed to use a respiratory treatment device (for example, a C-PAP or nebulizer) but does not currently have a working device. - Requires tracheal suctioning but does not have a tracheostomy. How to Determine the Frequency: Use the \"Person is Independent\" column if the person can manage their Oxygen and/or Respiratory Treatments tasks without help from another person. If they need assistance, select the frequency of the task completed most often according to the guidelines in Module 7.5-7.9. 7.19 Dialysis Definition: Dialysis artificially filters and removes waste products and excess water from the blood, a process normally performed by the kidneys. There are two types of dialysis\u2014hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis is where an external machine cleans the blood and it is provided at a hemodialysis center. Peritoneal dialysis is where the person's abdominal cavity is used to filter the blood and it is completed at the person's residence. Arteriovenous Fistulas/Shunts/Grafts Most dialysis patients will have a catheter in their forearm that loops from a vein to an artery, to allow easy access for dialysis and blood draws. There are two entry points (at the vein and artery), which are usually covered by one large sterile dressing, with the U-shaped catheter secured to the dressing and clamped off. This is called an arteriovenous (A-V) fistula or shunt or graft. Skilled cares for the A-V shunt are usually completed in the dialysis center and are recorded in the Dialysis row of the HRS Table. There are usually not any other skilled tasks completed between dialysis treatments. In the rare case when additional skilled cares to an A-V shunt are needed, that assistance would be recorded in the IV row. An example would be daily site care/dressing changes to an A-V shunt site (see Module 7.13). Check this for a person who: - Is undergoing dialysis at their residence OR in a dialysis center. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Needs transportation to the dialysis center; transportation is captured as an IADL task (see [Module 5.18](/functionalscreen/ltcfs/instructions5.htm#18)). This row is an exception to the rule that recorded HRS tasks must only be those provided in the person's residence. How to Determine the Frequency: If the person is receiving hemodialysis, capture the frequency of dialysis treatments at the dialysis center. Most people receive this type of dialysis three times a week. If the person is undergoing peritoneal dialysis, this usually occurs overnight in the person's residence. The person is often independent with this task, or they could have a nurse or family member assisting. If assistance is needed from another person, record the tasks of connecting and disconnecting the peritoneal dialysis as two separate tasks. Count hooking up and disconnecting as two separate tasks. So, if a person has peritoneal dialysis and requires help from another with this procedure, it counts as two tasks (hooking up and disconnecting) at a minimum. 7.20 TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) Definition: This is a type of liquid nutrition administered through an IV. It supplies all of the person's daily nutritional requirements and is used when the person cannot eat or cannot get enough nutrients from the foods they eat. It is always administered through an IV pump to precisely control the infusion rate. Check this for a person who: - Receives TPN at their residence. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Receives tube feedings, which are a different type of supplemental nutrition (see Module 7.23). - Receives IV medications, IV fluids, or IV line flushes, which has a separate HRS Table row, unless they receive that specific HRS task (see Module 7.13). How to Determine the Frequency: Use the \"Person is Independent\" column if the person can manage their TPN without help from another person. If they need assistance, select the frequency column according to the guidelines in Module 7.5-7.9. Sometimes TPN runs into the person continuously. If this is the case and they need help from another person, select the frequency this hook-up occurs, which is usually 3-4 times a day. 7.21 Transfusions Definition: An infusion of blood or one of its components, such as red blood cells or platelets, is delivered into a person's blood stream. The blood or blood product is delivered through an IV. A skilled health care provider would need to administer a transfusion. Check this for a person who: - Receives transfusions at their residence, in a clinic, or hospital. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Receives IV medications, IV fluids, or IV line flushes, which has a separate HRS Table row, unless they receive that specific HRS task (see Module 7.13). This row is an exception to the rule that HRS tasks recorded must be only those provided in the person's residence. REMINDER: When a person receives transfusions do not also select the IV Medications, fluids, or IV line flushes row, unless they receive that specific HRS task (see Module 7.13). How to Determine the Frequency: Use the \"Person is Independent\" column if the person can manage their Transfusions without help from another person. If the person receives transfusions at their residence, in a clinic, or hospital, select the frequency column according to the guidelines in Module 7.5-7.9. 7.22 Tracheostomy Care Definition: A tracheostomy is an artificial opening through the throat into the trachea or windpipe. It is kept open with a double-layered tube or cannula. The outer cannula is held in place by ties around the neck and is changed once a month. The inner cannula can be slid out and cleaned a few times a day. If mucous plugs up the tube, the inner cannula can be slid out, usually bringing the plug with it and leaving the outer cannula clear. The inner cannula can then be cleaned and slid back in. Tracheostomy care tasks include: - Removing, cleaning, or replacing the inner cannula. - Replacing the outer cannula. - Completing tracheostomy site care, which includes cleansing the skin around the tracheostomy opening, or applying ointment or dressing. - Changing the straps or ties that hold the tube in place. Check this for a person who: - Needs assistance with any of the tracheostomy care tasks listed above. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Needs assistance with tracheostomy care completed outside their residence (e.g., in a clinic or hospital). - Needs assistance wiping or applying gauze to a partially healed tracheostomy in which the tube is no longer needed and was removed. - Only needs assistance suctioning their trachea. That assistance is captured in Module 7.18 Oxygen and/or Respiratory Treatments. How to Determine the Frequency: Use the \"Person is Independent\" column if the person can complete their Tracheostomy Cares without help from another person. If they need assistance, select the frequency of the task completed most often according to the guidelines in Module 7.5-7.9. 7.23 Tube Feedings Definition: The administration of nutritionally balanced liquefied foods or nutrients through a tube. If a person cannot eat or cannot eat safely to obtain adequate nutrition, a feeding tube may be placed in the stomach or upper small intestine to provide nutrition. There are several different locations where a feeding tube can be placed on a person's body. The name of the type of tube matches the location. The types of tubes are: - NG (Nasogastric): A tube down the nose (or mouth) and esophagus to the stomach. An NG tube is typically used short term due to risk of aspiration into their lungs and discomfort in their nose and throat. - PEG or G-tube (Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) or \"Button\": A tube through the abdomen into the stomach. - Duodenostomy: A tube through the abdomen into the small intestine just below the stomach. (Commonly called a G-tube.) - J-tube (Jejunostomy): A tube goes through the abdomen into the second part of the small intestine just below the stomach. (Commonly called a J-tube.) Tube feeding tasks include: - Hooking up the bag of nutrition solution, tubing, and pump. - Starting the drip. - Ensuring the proper flow rate. - Disconnecting the tube feeding, flushing the tube or button (feeding port), and capping the tube off. - Administration of bolus feeding by syringe. - Site care for an excoriated (raw) feeding tube site. Check this for a person who: - Needs assistance with any of the tube feeding tasks as listed above. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Only needs assistance with tube feedings completed outside their residence. - Only needs assistance with soap and water cleaning around their feeding tube site. - Can eat without any problems and a G-tube is only used to administer medication. In this circumstance, flushing the tube after giving the medication is not captured on this row, but is a Medication Administration task (see Module 7.14). - Receives TPN (see Module 7.20). TPN is a different type of supplemental nutrition. How to Determine the Frequency: Use the \"Person is Independent\" column if the person can complete their Tube Feedings without help from another person. If they need assistance, select the frequency of the task completed most often and according to the guidelines in Module 7.5-7.9. 7.24 Ulcer\u2014Stage 2 Definition: An area of partial-thickness skin loss, presenting superficially as a pink/red area, abrasion, blister, or small crater. This is only the very beginning of skin breakdown. Ulcer-Stage 2 wound care will include cleansing or dressing the wound. Check this for a person who has been diagnosed as having an Ulcer-Stage 2 and: - Needs assistance with prescribed and completed Ulcer-Stage 2 wound care provided in their residence. - Needs assistance with prescribed and completed wound care provided outside their residence because the Ulcer-Stage 2 wound care cannot be provided in their residence. - Has whirlpool or water therapy provided by a physical therapist, even if this type of Ulcer-Stage 2 wound care is provided outside of their residence. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Needs assistance with prescribed and completed Ulcer-Stage 2 wound care provided outside their residence. - Needs assistance with routine skin care (e.g., applying non-prescription lotion) or only when band aids are used. - Needs assistance monitoring their skin's integrity when they are at risk for impaired skin integrity. REMINDER: On the HRS Table, if a person has more than one type of skin ulcer, record their need for assistance on both the Ulcer-Stage 2 and the Ulcer-Stage 3 or 4 rows. How to Determine the Frequency: Use the \"Person is Independent\" column if the person can complete their Ulcer-Stage 2 wound care without help from another person. If they need assistance, select the frequency of the task completed most often and according to the guidelines in Module 7.5-7.9. 7.25 Ulcer\u2014Stage 3 or 4 Definition: A Stage 3 ulcer has full thickness skin loss and presents as a deep crater with or without affecting the adjacent tissue. A Stage 4 ulcer has full thickness skin loss with extensive destruction, tissue necrosis, or damage to muscle, bone, or supporting structures. Ulcer-Stage 3 or 4 wound care will include cleansing, packing, or dressing the wound. Check this for a person who has been diagnosed as having an Ulcer-Stage 3 or 4 and: - Needs assistance with prescribed and completed Ulcer-Stage 3 or 4 wound care provided in their residence. - Needs assistance with prescribed and completed Ulcer-Stage 3 or 4 wound care provided outside their residence because the wound care cannot be provided in their residence. - Has whirlpool or water therapy provided by a physical therapist, even if this type of wound care is provided outside of the person's residence. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Needs assistance with prescribed and completed Ulcer-Stage 3 or 4 wound care provided outside their residence. REMINDER: On the HRS Table, if a person has more than one type of skin ulcer, record their need for assistance on both the Ulcer-Stage 2 and the Ulcer-Stage 3 or 4 rows. How to Determine the Frequency: Use the \"Person is Independent\" column if the person can complete their Ulcer-Stage 3 or 4 care without help from another person. If they need assistance, select the frequency of the task completed most often and according to the guidelines in Module 7.5-7.9. 7.26 Urinary Catheter-Related Skilled Tasks (Irrigation, Straight Catheterizations) Definition: A urinary catheter is any tube system placed in the body to drain and collect urine from the bladder. A health care provider will recommend use of the catheter for short-term use or long-term use. Short-term use is typically with straight catheterization, also known as \"straight caths\" or \"intermittent urinary catheterizations\" and are an \"in and out\" catheterization usually completed every 4 or 8 hours. Long-term use is typically with an indwelling catheter that is left in place and is connected to a drainage bag. Urinary catheter-related skilled tasks include: - Changing (replacing) the catheter. - Irrigating the catheter. - Completing a straight (in and out) catheterization. - For a suprapubic catheter, completing site care (i.e., cleansing the skin around the opening, applying ointment, or applying a dressing). Check this for a person who: - Needs assistance with any of the skilled tasks listed above. - Independently completes their straight catheterizations. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Receives routine catheter care for an indwelling catheter (that is not a suprapubic catheter). Routine catheter care is usually just soap and water cleansing, which is a normal part of bathing. - Uses a condom catheter. REMINDER: If Urinary Catheter-Related Skilled Tasks is selected on the HRS Table, then the Toileting ADL, \"Uses urinary catheter\" should also be selected. How to Determine the Frequency: Use the \"Person is Independent\" column if the person can complete their Urinary Catheter-Related Skilled Tasks without help from another person. If they need assistance, select the frequency of the task completed most often and according to the guidelines in Module 7.5-7.9. If an indwelling catheter is only used at night, the task of putting it in and taking it out are two separate tasks. 7.27 Other Wound Cares (Not Catheter Sites, Ostomy Sites, IVs or Ulcer Stage\u20142, 3, or 4) Definition: Use this row when a person needs wound care from a postsurgical incision or puncture, orthopedic pin site, postsurgical drainage site, serious burn, traumatic injury, or serious infection. Other Wound Cares can include, but are not limited to, care for a boil, cellulitis, stasis dermatitis, or stasis ulcer. This prescribed wound or site care includes cleansing, packing, or dressing the wound or site. Check this for a person who: - Needs assistance with prescribed and completed wound care provided in their residence for a type of wound listed in the above definition. - Has a history of infection or a need to seek medical attention when they pick or rub their skin and that behavior has resulted in an open area needing treatment. - Needs assistance with prescribed and completed wound care provided outside their residence because the Other Wound Cares cannot be provided in their residence. - Has whirlpool or water therapy provided by a physical therapist, even if this type of wound care is provided outside of the person's residence. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Needs assistance with a catheter site, ostomy site, or IV site (including a PICC line or central line site). - Only needs assistance changing a band aid to the area. - Already has the Ulcer-Stage 2 or Ulcer-Stage 3 or 4 row(s) selected because that is a different type of wound care. Use this row only if the person has other wounds as described in the definition above. - Needs assistance with wound care provided outside their residence. - Receives site care to an area where an IV was taken out and an IV is no longer in place. This need is captured in Module 7.13 IV Medications, Fluids, or IV Line Flushes. REMINDER: On the HRS Table, if a person has more than one type of wound, record their need for assistance on the applicable HRS Table rows. How to Determine the Frequency: Use the \"Person is Independent\" column if the person can complete their Other Wound Cares without help from another person. If they need assistance, select the frequency of the task completed most often and according to the guidelines in Module 7.5-7.9. 7.28 Ventilator-Related Interventions Definition: A ventilator (also known as a respirator) is the equipment used to mechanically assist breathing by delivering air to the lungs. A ventilator can take over the act of breathing completely or assist weakened respiratory muscles. Use of the ventilator can be short-term or long-term, depending on the individual's medical needs and condition. Use this row when a person needs to use a mechanical volume ventilator. Check this for a person who: - Uses a ventilator as defined above. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Uses a C-PAP or Bi-PAP machine. Use of those types of respiratory equipment is captured in the Oxygen/Respiratory Treatments row (see Module 7.18). How to Determine the Frequency: Use the \"Person is Independent\" column if the person can complete their Ventilator-Related Interventions without help from another person. If they need assistance, select the frequency of the task completed most often and according to the guidelines in Module 7.5-7.9. 7.29 Requires Nursing Assessment and Interventions Definition: The Requires Nursing Assessment and Interventions (RNAI) row is marked to indicate a current, usually short-term, health instability that requires skilled nursing assessment by a registered nurse (RN) or nurse practitioner (NP), and interventions to make or follow through on changes in medical treatment or nursing care plan. - Nursing assessment is the systematic collection and evaluation of data about the health status of an individual and the individual's response to the current medical treatment and nursing interventions. - Nursing interventions are nursing activities such as administering skilled care; delegating tasks; adjusting the care plan; consultation and education of individuals, family members, and caregivers; consulting with physicians and other healthcare professionals; and providing psychosocial counseling. - Nursing care plan includes nursing interventions, tasks delegated or assigned to others, and recommendations regarding the individual's health. In interdisciplinary models, it is not a separate document, but is part of the person-centered plan or individual service plan (ISP). It refers to the nursing aspects of a person-centered plan or ISP. It does not include other activities like ordering supplies or general care management. - Short-term means less than 90 days. Most nursing assessments and interventions are captured in other rows of the HRS Table. The RNAI row is intended only for a small minority of cases in which nursing care is not captured elsewhere in the HRS Table. Each of the following four criteria MUST be present whenever the RNAI row is selected: - A current health instability that - Requires skilled nursing assessment and interventions, AND - Involves CHANGES in the medical treatment or nursing care plan, AND - Cannot be captured in any other row of the HRS Table. REMINDER: An individual's need for telephone contact with a nurse can be recorded on this row only if the four criteria above are met. REMINDER: Medication changes that do not require skilled nursing assessment and interventions must be recorded in the Medication Management row of the HRS Table, not in the RNAI row. RNAI is generally a short-term need because: - Nursing interventions are either effective over several weeks or months, or other plans must be established to ensure the individual's safety and health. - RNAI includes only those skilled nursing assessments and interventions that are needed to address a current health instability requiring changes to medical treatment or nursing care plans. Almost all needs for ongoing health-related or skilled nursing services must be recorded elsewhere on the HRS Table. Examples: - A 79-year-old woman is on numerous medications for atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, hypertension, arthritis, and diabetes mellitus. She is frail and unstable, with medication changes based on her vital signs and comfort level. However, her ongoing nursing assessments all relate to her medications. These are captured in the Medication Management row, not in the RNAI row. - Individual has a Stage 3 ulcer. The RN does comprehensive wound care, which includes assessments and interventions concerning healing, nutritional status, fluid status, mobility, cognition, coping, etc. All of this assistance is captured in the Ulcer Stage 3 or 4 row, not in the RNAI row. - Nursing assessments and interventions related to oxygen level checks are recorded in the Oxygen or Respiratory Treatments row, if the individual is on oxygen or getting respiratory treatments, not in the RNAI row. - Dialysis treatments at a clinic include comprehensive nursing assessments 3 times/week. These are captured in the Dialysis row, not in the RNAI row. Check this for a person who: - Meets the required four criteria above, including an individual who: - Has a current health instability in a medical or psychiatric condition that requires skilled nursing assessment, intervention, and changes in medical treatment or nursing care plan that are not captured in other rows of the HRS Table, or - Was recently discharged from a hospital or nursing home, is weak and unstable, with new limitations and new medications, requiring nursing visits several times a week for assessments, care planning, and skilled nursing interventions. This individual has instabilities likely requiring changes to medical treatment or nursing care plan, at least for a few weeks. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Has other HRS Table rows selected recording all nursing assessment and interventions the individual needs. - Has a cognitive impairment but does not have an acute, unstable health condition requiring nursing assessments and interventions. - Does not have an acute, unstable health condition requiring nursing assessments and interventions, even if that person: - Has a need for skilled nursing interventions without a need for nursing assessment or changes in medical treatment or nursing care plan. - Has long-term health instabilities without a need for changes in medical treatment or nursing care plan because there is an established plan of care (\"standing orders\") in place for a long-term instability. Examples include, but are not limited to: - PRN medications for seizures. - PRN medications or treatments for chronic pain or other chronic conditions. - Sliding scale insulin (when each insulin dosage is adjusted based on the blood glucose test result). - When the individual's lower legs retain fluid they are to elevate their legs above their heart for at least 30 minutes. - When the individual becomes short of breath they are to use their oxygen. - Has a personal care worker or others who perform delegated tasks that need nursing oversight and supervision. - Has nursing assessments only because they are routinely provided by the agency or residential care facility. - Has nursing care management activities. - Has RN or NP participation on an interdisciplinary team. - Receives skilled nursing care provided in a clinic setting for dialysis, wound care, transfusions, or other services noted elsewhere on the HRS Table. - Has a history of skin breakdown and has an RN or NP check the integrity of their skin. - Receives ventilator-related interventions completed by an RN or NP, without first confirming the care need meets the required four criteria. - Needs data collection. Examples include but are not limited to: - The documenting of weights, blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugars, seizure activity, etc., almost always involves the effectiveness, side effects, or adjustments of medication and is recorded in the Medication Management row of the HRS Table. - The needed measurement of an individual's fluid intake and output (I & O) is recorded in the \"Other\" row of the HRS Table, with description of the care need added to the Notes section. - Caregiver(s) documenting an individual's health status (e.g., daily or at the end of each shift). How to Determine the Frequency: Use of the \"Person is Independent\" column is not an option for the RNAI row. If the person needs assistance from another person, select the frequency column according to the guidelines in Module 7.5-7.9. 7.30 \"Other\" Row Check this for a person who: - Needs health-related services provided in their residence that you are unable to capture on any other row of the HRS Table. - Has a chest or abdomen drainage tube. - Needs assistance to use their TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) unit. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Needs assistance with a task that should be recorded elsewhere on the screen or should only be included in the screen's Notes section to further describe the person's needed service. How to Determine the Frequency: Use the \"Person is Independent\" column if the person can complete their Other tasks without help from another person. If they need assistance, select the frequency of the task completed most often, according to the guidelines in Module 7.5-7.9. 7.31 Skilled Therapies: PT, OT, SLP (Any One or a Combination, at Any Location) Definition: Use of this row reflects the person is receiving services from a physical therapist, occupational therapist, or speech-language pathologist. - Physical Therapist (PT): A physical therapist helps with the body's recovery after a person's accident or illness. The physical therapist helps with muscle strength, movement of the joints, and more complicated body skills such as sitting, walking, and balance, or the use of a cane, walker, or wheelchair. - Occupational Therapist (OT): An occupational therapist helps the person regain everyday skills that might have been lost because of an injury or illness. The occupational therapist will help with everyday activities like eating, brushing teeth, cooking, and housework. They also work on the problem-solving skills needed for managing a residence or for working. - Speech Therapist (SLP): A speech-language pathologist helps with speaking, listing, reading, and writing problems. In addition, they help the person with swallowing problems or who have difficulties in thinking and memory. When a person has speaking difficulties, the speech-language pathologist can help the person and others in their life develop alternative ways to communicate with each other. Check this for a person who: - Receives therapies from a licensed PT, OT, SLP at any location. This row is an exception to the rule that HRS tasks provided in the person's residence can be recorded on the HRS Table. - Receives therapy from a licensed PT, OT, or SLP during the school year while attending high school. Do NOT check this for a person who: - Receives PT, OT, or SLP from someone other than a licensed PT, OT, or SLP. This includes exercises completed with a family member, someone significant in the person's life, caregiver, physical therapy assistant, or an occupational therapy assistant, even if under the instructions of an OT, PT, or SLP. This type of needed assistance is captured in the Exercises/Range of Motion HRS task (see Module 7.12). - Needs assistance with the completion of their range of motion exercises or completes these exercises independently. This type of needed assistance is captured in the Exercises/Range of Motion HRS task (see Module 7.12). - Receives therapy other than physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech-language pathology. Those types of therapies include, but are not limited to, the following: art, cardiac, massage, music, pulmonary, or therapeutic horseback riding. - Has a current physician's order for PT, OT, or SLP, but that therapy is not available and they are on a wait list. They lack access to the therapy but are planning on accepting the service. In this case, do not select \"Person is Independent\" or any other \"Frequency of Help/Services Needed from Other Persons\" option. - Chooses not to have skilled therapy (the person is declining the task itself). If the individual has declined to complete the health-related service or task itself, and is able to perceive and recognize the potential risk or negative health outcome that could result from declining the task, the screener should leave the default selection of \"N/A.\" In this situation, the person has no need for assistance with the health-related service or task because the health-related service or task is not occurring. - If the person is not able to perceive and recognize the potential risk or negative health outcome that could result from declining the task, the screener should select the frequency of need. - If a person has a legal guardian, an activated power of attorney for health care, or is currently involved with adult protective services, that person may be considered not able to perceive and recognize potential risks or negative health outcomes, and the selection of a need might be appropriate. REMINDER: Once a person no longer receives OT, PT, or SLP, their LTCFS should be updated to reflect that the therapy is no longer provided. For example, at the time of the screening, the person was receiving OT and PT on a short-term basis while rehabilitating from hip replacement surgery and would most likely complete OT and PT within several months of surgery. How to Determine the Frequency: There are only two frequency options, \"1-4 sessions/week\" or \"5+ sessions/week.\" Select the frequency column which reflects the combined number of the person's OT, PT, and SLP sessions each week. For example: A person receives PT and OT once each day, 2 days per week and receives SLP once a day, 3 days per week. This adds up to seven sessions per week to record in the \"5+ sessions per week\" column. "}
