It's a form of holistic medicine. The theory is based on the recognition of Qi. It is believed that the knowledge was coming from Huang Di and Shen Nong, hemi gods, and other sages. They discovered the meridian and acu-points inside the human body when they were in the deep meditation, and also discovered the relationship between human body and their environment. The knowledge they discovered were so profound that the TCM sages created those very symbolic words to describe their experience, such as Qi, Yin/Yang, Fire, Water, Wood, etc. Those words have their very profound and rich meanings, and it is very hard to understand by contemporary knowledge. However if you really master it, you will be able to have a new approach to reach health through balancing energy flow internally, and the harmonious between human and environment will be reached. That is also the meaning of Dzogchen, the great perfection. If you are sincerely interested in how to maintain health and seek the deep well-being, come to our office and you will have direct experience of the power of healing.

Its practical principles and methods are not so difficult to understand: Besides acupuncture, many other techniques and approaches, e.g., herb medicine, cupping, moxa, acupressure, Tui Na, massage, Gua Sha, are also used in TCM.
