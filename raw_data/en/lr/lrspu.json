Artigo | [vaccine]wanes overtime. This longitudinal [prospective study]compared the effect of a booster [vaccine]( [BNT162b2]) in inducing the mucosal (nasal) and serological antibody between Covid-19 recovered [SARS-CoV-2]and omicron (BA.1) variant receptor binding domain were measured in their nasal epithelial lining fluid and [plasma]. Result In the recovered group, the booster expanded the nasal [IgA]dominancy inherited from natural [infection]to [IgA]and [IgG]. higher [IgG]levels with a omicron BA.1 variant and ancestral [SARS-CoV-2]when compared [vaccine]-only subjects. The nasal S1-specific [IgA]induced by natural [infection]lasted longer than those induced by [vaccines]while the [plasma] [antibodies]of both groups maintained at a high level for at least 21 weeks after booster. Conclusion The booster benefited all subjects to obtain [neutralizing antibody](NAb) against omicron BA.1 variant in [plasma]while only the Covid-19 recovered subjects had an extra enrichment in nasal NAb against omicron BA.1 variant.
