Award Information](#_Section_II._Award_1) Eligibility Information](#_Section_III._Eligibility) [Section and Submission Information](#_Section_IV._Application_1) [Section V. Application Review Information](#_Section_V._Application) [Section VII. Agency Contacts](#_Section_VII._Agency) [Section VIII. Other Information](#_Section_VIII._Other) The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to develop an increased understanding of the biology and immunology of natural viral infections and HIV vaccine vectors derived from these viruses. Applications should focus on four types of vaccine viral vector platforms developed from Adenoviridae, Poxviridae, Herpesviridae, and Adeno-associated viruses in humans or non-human primates (NHPs). It is anticipated that this research may lead to clearer understanding of vector-host interactions and therefore, a reduction in unanticipated adverse events associated with uncharacterized host-vector interactions. Goals of the research can also include the development of improved safety models to assess the potential vaccine-related effects such as increased HIV infection rates due to immune activated vector-specific HIV target cells (e.g. CD4+ T-cells, etc.). Such animal models (e.g., NHP, humanized mouse models, etc.) must be capable of quantitatively assessing the potential for increased HIV acquisition following vaccination to permit better preclinical assessment of future vaccines candidates. This research would inform earlier decisions on safety related to potential vaccine-related effects. In recent years both the vaccine field and gene therapy field have employed an array of vectors to deliver vaccine antigens and targeted genes, respectively. Often little is known about the basic biology of the vector or host interactions, and less is known about host immune responses to the vector in either a na\u00efve or naturally-exposed hosts. Recently, there have been a number of unexpected findings both in the vaccine and gene therapy fields that have underscored the need for greater understanding of the basic elements of vector-host interactions. Examples include two vaccine human efficacy trials of an HIV-1 prophylactic vaccine aimed at inducing CMI responses that could prevent infection or reduce post-infection viremia (STEP trial, HVTN 502/Merck 023) and of replication-incompetent adenovirus 5 (MRKAd5 HIV-1) vectors expressing HIV-1 clade B antigens. Both trials were unexpectedly halted for futility in achieving the study primary endpoints (follow-up continued for two years after interim analysis). In subjects with higher pre-existing Ad5-specific neutralizing antibody titers, a greater number of HIV-1 infections occurred in vaccinees than in placebo recipients. Post-hoc multivariate analysis further suggested that the greatest increased risk was in men who had higher pre-existing Ad5-specific neutralizing antibodies and who were uncircumcised. Vaccination of Ad5-seropositive individuals with an Ad5-based HIV vaccine appeared to be associated with an increased risk of HIV acquisition. This was not predicted and the precise mechanism for this remains unknown. The effect was not seen in NHP studies with adenovirus vectors, although the animal models were not designed to detect such effects. It remains unclear whether this risk is biologic or confounded by behavior or other factors, such as geographic clustering of cases or infection with strains of unusual virulence. Several hypotheses have been proposed for the increased susceptibility to infection after vaccination of Ad5 seropositive versus sero-negative volunteers, including: (1) Presence of vaccine-boosted adenovirus-specific T cells (specifically CD4 T cells) at mucosal sites among persons with previous immunity to the vector. This increase in activated target cells at mucosal sites could result in increased susceptibility to HIV infection following high-risk sexual behavior; (2) Responses in pre-Ad immune and reduced innate immune responses to HIV-1 infection, hence leading to higher HIV acquisition rates in sexually exposed men; (3) Prior immunity produced 'enhancing' antibodies that homed to mucosal sites which led to increased susceptibility to HIV infection. These competing hypotheses highlight the lack of knowledge of Ad5-host interactions, especially in naturally infected and vaccinated individuals. This underscores the importance of understanding the biology and immunology of the vector-host interaction and how it might impact the response to the vaccine. Similarly, the first clinical trial of a systemically administered adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector for hemophilia B was stopped and subsequently discontinued when several study participants developed transient hepatitis, possibly due to the generation of CTLs to proteins in the vector's capsid. Lastly, poxvirus vectors used in vaccine development have been linked to rare reports of myocarditis in clinical studies. As a consequence, the FDA has required monitoring of cardiac function in trials involving pox vectors. Interestingly, these effects were not observed in any of the existing animal models. These unanticipated results illustrate the need for understanding of the basic biology and immunology of vector-host relationships and for appropriate animal models to study rare and unanticipated events. This initiative is intended to advance understanding of 1) the biology and immune response to live attenuated or replication-defective viral vectors developed from Adenoviridae, Poxviridae, Adeno-associated viruses, and Herpesviridae families in humans and NHPs, and 2) the development of animal models (e.g., NHP, humanized mouse models, etc.) that could better evaluate the potential for increased HIV acquisition following vaccination. Applications may propose but are not limited to: Applications proposing inclusion of subjects and/or utilization of subject samples (e.g. mucosal) from clinical trials for the evaluation of immunologic and other relevant parameters in order to study and define the underlying immunological and biologic mechanisms of vaccines and human immunologic function are encouraged.

Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. As part of the [NIH mission](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149), all applications submitted to the NIH in support of biomedical and behavioral research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Significance Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? Investigator(s) Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or New Investigators, or in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? Innovation Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? Approach Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? If the project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? Environment Will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements? As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items. Protections for Human Subjects For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Human Subjects](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11175). Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children When the proposed project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of children to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. For additional information on review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Inclusion in Clinical Research](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11174). Vertebrate Animals The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following five points: 1) proposed use of the animals, and species, strains, ages, sex, and numbers to be used; 2) justifications for the use of animals and for the appropriateness of the species and numbers proposed; 3) adequacy of veterinary care; 4) procedures for limiting discomfort, distress, pain and injury to that which is unavoidable in the conduct of scientifically sound research including the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs and/or comfortable restraining devices; and 5) methods of euthanasia and reason for selection if not consistent with the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia. For additional information on review of the Vertebrate Animals section, please refer to the [Worksheet for Review of the Vertebrate Animal Section](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11150). Biohazards Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed. Resubmissions For Resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project. Renewals For Renewals, the committee will consider the progress made in the last funding period. Revisions For Revisions, the committee will consider the appropriateness of the proposed expansion of the scope of the project. If the Revision application relates to a specific line of investigation presented in the original application that was not recommended for approval by the committee, then the committee will consider whether the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group are adequate and whether substantial changes are clearly evident. As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score. Applications from Foreign Organizations Reviewers will assess whether the project presents special opportunities for furthering research programs through the use of unusual talent, resources, populations, or environmental conditions that exist in other countries and either are not readily available in the United States or augment existing U.S. resources. . Select Agent Research Reviewers will assess the information provided in this section of the application, including 1) the Select Agent(s) to be used in the proposed research, 2) the registration status of all entities where Select Agent(s) will be used, 3) the procedures that will be used to monitor possession use and transfer of Select Agent(s), and 4) plans for appropriate biosafety, biocontainment, and security of the Select Agent(s). Resource Sharing Plans Reviewers will comment on whether the following Resource Sharing Plans, or the rationale for not sharing the following types of resources, are reasonable: 1) [Data Sharing Plan](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11151); 2) [Sharing Model Organisms](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11152); and 3) [Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS)](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11153).
