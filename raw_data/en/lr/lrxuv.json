Methods: A consensus-building method was used with an international panel of experts to identify and prioritize the most promising applications of regenerative medicine for improving health in developing countries. Thematic analysis was used to identify the criteria that informed the decision-making of the panellists. Results: Participants ranked the ten most promising regenerative medicine applications. The top-ranked application was novel methods of insulin replacement and pancreatic islet cell regeneration for diabetes. Six decision-making criteria were identified: burden, impact, feasibility, affordability, acceptability, and indirect benefits. Conclusions: This study indicates that regenerative medicine could potentially be relevant to developing countries, and is the first to systematically identify and prioritize applications of regenerative medicine that are the most promising for improving health in developing countries. ii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to extend my sincerest thanks to my supervisor, Prof. Abdallah Daar, for his support and guidance throughout this work.

This introductory chapter outlines the research objectives (1.2) and rationale (1.3) for this study. Next, literature that provides background and context is reviewed (1.4), including: e Global health ethics (1.4.1) e Science and technology for development (1.4.2) e Regenerative medicine (1.4.3) e Gaps in the literature (1.4.4) The final section provides a summary of the contents of subsequent chapters (1.5). 1.2 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES This study asks which applications of regenerative medicine could potentially be used to address the health needs of developing countries. For the purposes of this study, the term \"developing countries\" denotes all countries listed as such in the United Nations Human Development Report 2005.\" To address the above research question, this study has two objectives: 1. To systematically identify and prioritize applications of regenerative medicine that are the most promising for improving health in developing countries. 2. To describe the criteria used by an international panel of experts to decide which applications of regenerative medicine are the most promising for improving health in developing countries. 1.3 RESEARCH RATIONALE Regenerative medicine is an emerging field that seeks to combine the knowledge and expertise of diverse disciplines towards the aim of addressing impaired function in the body.'\u00ae'\u00ae Its goal is not just to replace what is malfunctioning, but to provide the elements required for in vivo repair, to devise replacements that seamlessly interact with the living body, and to stimulate the body's intrinsic capacities to regenerate.\"\u00b0 The potential for this field to improve our ability to fight disease and to repair the human body is considered to be great.'\u00ae The United States National Academies of Science report Stem Cells and the Future of Regenerative Medicine estimates that the potential patient populations in the United States for stem cell-based therapies include over a hundred million patients with conditions such as cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and burns.2!_ The British Standards Institution, the national standards body of the United Kingdom, estimates that the European market for regenerative medicine products will reach $15 billion by the year 2010.7? As such, significant funding and research activity has been devoted to regenerative medicine worldwide. In the state of California alone, the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine was established to oversee the allocation of the same level of funding as was devoted to the Human Genome Project: $3 billion over ten years.' The Canadian Institutes of Health Research have committed nearly $30 million over five years to the Regenerative Medicine and Nanomedicine Initiative,\" while the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research has devoted \u20ac45 million to two large research priorities in regenerative medicine,' and the Science Foundation of Ireland has invested \u20ac15 million to establish the Regenerative Medicine Institute (REMEDI) at the National University of Ireland, Galway.\" To date, however, the potential benefits of regenerative medicine for developing countries have not been included in discussions of the potential impact of the field. This omission is severe given that over two thirds of the world's population live in developing countries and that the conditions that are the main targets of regenerative medicine, noncommunicable diseases, occur at higher rates in developing than developed countries.\" An epidemiological transition has occurred in developing countries, such that traditional assumptions regarding their burden of disease are no longer valid. Once thought of as \"Western diseases\", noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, are rapidly increasing in low- and middle-income countries on top of the persisting threat of infectious disease. This phenomenon is so severe that the World Health Organization refers to noncommunicable diseases in the developing world as \"neglected epidemics\".*> By 2020, it is estimated that 7/10 deaths in developing countries will be attributable to noncommunicable diseases.\"\u00b0 Developing countries now account for 80% of global cardiovascular disease- related deaths; two-thirds of the 171 million people worldwide affected by diabetes reside in developing countries; and cancer rates are expected to increase by 73% in developing countries between 2000 and 2020, compared to a 29% increase in industrialized nations.\"\u00b0\"' In addition, noncommunicable diseases are affecting people at an earlier age in developing countries than developed countries.\"\u00b0 The burden of noncommunicable diseases in developing countries is worsened by the connection between noncommunicable and certain infectious diseases. Two billion people worldwide, for instance, have been infected with the hepatitis B virus, which can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma.\"\u00ae> Diabetes, meanwhile, can be induced by viral infections such as the coxsackie B virus that can cause inflammation and tissue damage in the pancreas.\"? In addition to noncommunicable and infectious diseases, trauma and injury represent a significant health burden in developing countries. Trauma and injury are often discussed in tandem with the burden of chronic disease due to their potential long- term repercussions for health.\"*> Low- and middle-income countries account for almost 90% of the world's deaths due to injury and trauma'? and for 80% of the world's disabled population, the vast majority of whom have little or no access to rehabilitation facilities.*! These conditions could all benefit from methods of addressing the impaired bodily function that they produce. One step towards ensuring that patients in the developing world are beneficiaries of advances in regenerative medicine along with those in industrialized nations is to identify the applications of regenerative medicine that are the most relevant for developing countries and to determine the criteria that informed the choice of these applications. Identifying promising regenerative medicine applications using foresight techniques could potentially aid in policy-making regarding competing priorities in science and technology.\" The need for focused policy is particularly relevant to developing countries given their limited resources available for health research'? As well, foresight studies have been found to provide additional benefits, including: encouraging long-term thinking; fostering better coordination between stakeholders; encouraging innovation by increasing communication; and helping to develop a shared vision of the future and commitment to specific goals.\" The results of a foresight study to determine the most promising applications of regenerative medicine for developing countries could serve as a guide to developing countries who wish engage in regenerative medicine research and development, and may help to focus the regenerative medicine community on the health needs of developing countries. Identifying the criteria used to determine the most promising regenerative medicine applications for improving health in developing countries lends support to such a foresight study by exploring whether or not the identified applications are grounded in the reality of developing countries. In addition, a previous foresight study on health biotechnology emphasized the potential for the criteria identified in that study to inform future assessments of emerging health biotechnologies.** Similarly, identifying the criteria used to determine the most promising applications of regenerative medicine for improving health in developing countries could be used in future assessments of emerging regenerative medicine applications. 1.4 LITERATURE REVIEW The literature that provides background and context for this study relates to three different topics: global health ethics, science and technology for development, and regenerative medicine. Each of these literatures will be reviewed and gaps in the literature will be highlighted. 1.4.1. Global Health Ethics The field of regenerative medicine's lack of focus on the populations of developing countries should be viewed within the context of broader health and health-related research gaps between industrialized and developing nations. There is an enormous disparity in health today between the world's rich and the world's poor. This disparity is illustrated by striking, and in cases widening, differences in life expectancy at birth between the developed and developing world.\"> Inequity in global health is additionally seen in the funding of health research, where 90% of global expenditures on health research are directed towards only 10% of the global burden? > Singer and Benatar\u00ae describe this global inequity in health as \"unconscionable\" and refer to it as one of the greatest ethical challenges facing the world today. These claims are furthered and explained by Benatar, Daar, and Singer'' in their description of \"the rationale for mutual caring\" that underlies global health ethics. This rationale involves the recognition that \"health, human rights, economic opportunities, good governance, peace and development are all intimately linked within a complex, interdependent world\", and that there are dangers to global stability associated with 7 excluding significant portions of the global population from the benefits of progress.' Benatar, Daar, and Singer further argue that bioethics can play a particular role in improving health globally by promoting shared values and a global state of mind. They encourage the bioethics community to expand its scope beyond a microlevel approach focused on individual health and interpersonal relationships to include meso- and macro-level issues concerning institutions, nations, and international relations.*\" Alkire and Chen*\u00ae outline four main schools of moral thought that support an ethical imperative to rectify the current state of global health: equity-based, humanitarianism, utilitarianism, and rights-based approaches. Each of these four schools of thought will be briefly described. First, equity-based approaches highlight the injustice of health disparities and advocate for a fairer distribution of resources and opportunities for good health.' Health equity is not concerned with all inequalities in health, such as health differences resulting from choices to pursue high-risk behaviours, but specifically with those inequalities that arise from 373940 Sen'! emphasizes that health equity concerns cannot be restricted to health unfairness. alone, but must consider contributing factors such as injustices in social institutions and arrangements. Dwyer** asks what justice demands in terms of global health, and outlines three duties required of the privileged towards the disadvantaged: duty not to harm, duty to reconstruct international arrangements, and duty to assist. He argues that the duty to assist has been the focus of the majority of global health initiatives, but that all three duties are required in order to achieve greater global health equity.\" Second, by humanitarian principles there is a moral obligation to help those in need and to respond to human suffering, including the need and suffering of the distant poor.\u00ae? Humanitarianism can be considered a form of virtue ethics,*\u00ae whereby moral character is of 44 Humanitarian prime importance rather than duties or the consequences of an action. actions exhibit virtues such as generosity, integrity, fairness, and philanthropy.*\u00ae Brownscombe* warns, however, that a moral response based primarily on humanitarian principles is susceptible to being influenced by media attention as much as by human need. Additionally, Alkire and Chen state that a sole focus on humanitarianism to justify global health initiatives may overlook underlying causes of health differences, such as discrimination and social injustice.*\u00ae Third, by utilitarian rationales there could be broad beneficial consequences and a potential to increase aggregate happiness by pursuing global health initiatives.** Utilitarian rationales emphasize the connections between health and other important components of society.\u00b0\u00ae Such reasoning can be seen in Benatar, Daar, and Singer's argument that increasing inequality will result in economic instability and pose a threat to security worldwide.*' Utilitarian reasoning is also evidenced in the report of the World Health Organization Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, which links investment in health with increased economic growth.*\u00a9 Botbol-Baum,\"' however, cautions against overemphasizing the utilitarian benefits of global health initiatives. He argues that utilitarianism can lead to a devaluing of health as a worthy goal in itself, and that it could potentially result in discrimination against economically vulnerable populations. Fourth, a rights-based rationale emphasizes human rights in health based on the dignity owed to all human beings.*\u00ae** Human rights in health are enshrined by the United Nations in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\" A failure to respect key values, such as human rights and respect for human life, is viewed by Benatar, Daar, and Singer*' as a major cause of global health disparities. These authors consider a respect for human rights to have universal significance and the potential to transcend national, cultural, and religious boundaries as a means of encouraging worldwide improvements in health.' The importance of addressing the duties and obligations of individuals, institutions, and societies that correspond to human rights is emphasized by certain authors as a means of progressing beyond simple rights-based rhetoric.**' Rights-based approaches have been criticized for overlooking relativist concerns regarding cultural diversity and pluralism in human rights.\u00b0!*? These four schools of moral thought, therefore, support an ethical imperative to address the current disparities in global health. The potential for regenerative medicine to be a means of contributing towards greater global health equity is informed by the literature on science and technology for development. 1.4.2 Science and Technology for Development Science and technology by themselves cannot resolve the complex development challenges faced by developing countries, nor do they address the lifestyle and socio-political factors that are key contributors to the global increase in rates of noncommunicable disease. There is, however, an increasing literature supporting science and technology as important 10 components of a comprehensive strategy to improve health and economic development.>*\u00b0 $- \u00b0\u00b0 Two reports are foundational to this literature. First, the United Nations Human Development Report 2001: Making New Technologies Work for Human Development provides evidence that technological advances, such as vaccines, antibiotics, fertilizers, and plant breeding techniques, have historically played a key role in improving human health and productivity.\u00b0' These technology-based improvements in health in turn lead to further improvements in health as a result of the productivity increase and economic development they stimulate.\u00b0' Second, Genomics and World Health, published by the World Health Organization in 2002, specifically highlights the potential for an emerging technology, genomics, to improve global health. This report discusses the potential benefits of advances in genomics research for developing countries for the treatment of both communicable and inherited diseases.** The ability of developing countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, a set of targets for poverty reduction, health improvement, and development agreed upon by all United Nations member states in 2000,\u00b0* is considered to be partly dependent on their ability to understand, adapt, and apply advances in science and technology.\u00b0\"*\" In the view of Juma and Yee-Cheong,\" the rapidly growing base of biomedical knowledge presents new opportunities to improve health in developing countries. The report of the World Health Organization Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, Innovation and Public Health, released in April 2006, also stresses the opportunity presented by emerging scientific advances, but notes that a weak capacity for research in most developing countries combined with a resource-poor market leads to these countries being largely dependent on products 11 designed for the health needs of industrialized nations. This report emphasizes the need for significantly increased research and development activities devoted to the health needs of developing countries, financially supported by both developed and developing country governments.\" The potential relevance of emerging technologies to developing countries is shown in two technology foresight studies that identified the most promising applications of biotechnology and nanotechnology for improving health in developing countries.*** Recombinant technologies to develop vaccines against infectious diseases, for instance, were identified as one such promising application of biotechnology\" and have been successfully exploited by Cuba in the development of the world's first meningitis B vaccine.\" Two main recommendations for harnessing science and technology for development emerge from the literature. First, that developing countries themselves should build capacity in science and technology and invest in health innovation.>**? A series of case studies of successful health biotechnology sectors in seven developing countries found that local innovation can encourage the development of affordable products to address local health needs.\u00a9? Second, that global science and technology policy and research should be redirected to focus specifically on development challenges.>\"? The Human Development Report 2001, for instance, supports a deliberate policy to direct the benefits of science and technology towards developing countries, explaining that the purchasing power of the world's poor is not sufficient to exert a strong market influence on the development of technology.\" The United Nations Development Programme Task Force on Science, Technology, and Innovation report Innovation: Applying Knowledge in Development identifies six key areas 12 for policy action aimed at harnessing the benefits of science, technology, and innovation for development.\" Among these, it is recommended that the science and technology policy environment in developing countries be improved, particularly with respect to methods of generating and transmitting advice to governments. Foresight techniques are specifically recommended as a tool for identifying funding priorities and informing policy-making in developing countries, particularly when assessing emerging fields of science and technology.\" The potential benefits for developing countries of several emergent fields of science and 54.63 and nanotechnology,\"! have previously technology, such as genomics,\" biotechnology, been studied. To date, however, the potential for regenerative medicine to improve health in developing countries has not been examined and there has been no use of foresight techniques to systematically identify and prioritize which applications of regenerative medicine have the most potential for improving the health of people in developing countries. Prior to considering the potential applications of regenerative medicine in developing countries, however, the field of regenerative medicine itself will be briefly reviewed. 1.4.3 Regenerative Medicine The term \"regenerative medicine\" can be found in literature dating as early as 1997. It did not, however, gain widespread recognition and come into frequent use until the year 2000 when William Haseltine, the man credited with coining the term,'**\" described and publicized his vision of the field.\u00b0\u00ae Haseltine describes regenerative medicine as a field made up of diverse technologies united by a common need: to devise innovative solutions to 13 1869 This need has stimulated the restore impaired anatomy and physiological function. emergence of regenerative medicine and has gained importance in recent years due to an aging population\" combined with an already high demand for replacement therapies to treat congenital defects, injuries, and disease.\" The targets of regenerative medicine and the conditions to which it is applicable are broad. Examples include chronic degenerative (e.g. Alzheimer's), metabolic (e.g. diabetes), and ischemic (e.g. stroke) diseases, many of which lead to organ failure. The notion of restoring impaired function also extends to include wound regeneration,' immune system repair or enhancement,\" and the targeting of abnormal cancer cells.\"4 The goal of developing innovative solutions to restore impaired function, rather than the use of a specific technology, is the main defining feature of regenerative medicine.'> While the disciplines and technologies that can contribute towards achieving this goal are not limited, examples of contributing disciplines currently include: stem cell biology, cell, tissue and organ transplantation, genetics and molecular biology, tissue engineering, developmental biology, and materials science. Key to the field of regenerative medicine is the notion that the transfer of knowledge between collaborating disciplines will allow for the achievement of innovative solutions that are beyond what could be accomplished by any single discipline alone.\" The combination of technological approaches that go beyond the traditional is also partly how regenerative medicine can be distinguished from traditional transplantation and replacement therapies.'\"\u00b0 Thus artificial replacement therapies\"\u00b0 such as dialysis machines for end-stage renal failure would not constitute regenerative medicine, but an advanced bioartificial construct might.\" 14 There is still, however, a lack of consensus in the academic literature regarding a precise definition of regenerative medicine. This is reflected by the absence of a clear definition statement from many publications, and by the diversity of definitions found when comparing publications that do mention a definition of sorts. Examples of key publications that lack a clear definition statement include the work of Haseltine.'* Although Haseltine conducted pioneering work in outlining a vision for the emerging field of regenerative medicine,\" he did not consolidate his vision into a definition statement that clearly captures the aims, targets, and methods of the wider field. Such a definition statement is also absent from the recently published books, Regenerative Medicine I: Theories, Models and Methods, and 71,78 Regenerative Medicine II: Clinical and Preclinical Applications, which are the first attempts to provide a set of textbooks that discuss regenerative medicine as a unified field. Publications that do attempt a definition statement show a variety of interpretations,!?\u00b0\"\"\u00b0\" and exhibit a tendency to define the field from the perspective of a certain contributing 21,67,80 discipline rather than capturing the diversity of the field. Table 1 shows examples of such definitions and provides a list of shortcomings identified by Daar and Greenwood.\" Table 1 Examples of Existing Definitions of Regenerative Medicine Definition Shortcomings \"A field of medicine concerned with developing and using \u00a2 Omits \"regeneration\" strategies aimed at repair or replacement of damaged, \u00ab Limits the technologies that may be diseased, or metabolically deficient organs, tissues, and cells used towards RM's goals via tissue engineering; cell transplantation; and artificial organs e Fails to emphasize and bioartificial organs and tissues.\" : : - interdisciplinarity (National Library of Medicine) \"In regenerative medicine...the ultimate goal is to replace, e Focuses on cells in combination repair and regenerate cells, tissues and organs in order to with other technologies, while restore biological function that has been halted or compromised by injury or disease. Achieving this goal may require hamessing the activities of exogenous and endogenous stem and progenitor cells, perhaps in combination with biomolecules and biomaterials, and integrating them into host tissue while avoiding host rejection, tumorigenesis or other adverse events.\" (NIH RFA, 2005) \"Regenerative medicine is defined as a new research area with the aim of tissue and organ repair and regeneration by means of the natural components and signal molecules of living organisms (i.e. stem cells, growth factors, etc.).\" (Cancedda, 2003) \",..a unifying theme for a diverse set of technologies that have the opportunity to...repair and restore our bodies to normal functioning health.\" ... \"There are four major disciplines that compose regenerative medicine...the use of our own genes and proteins...the use of individual cells as therapy...the use of stem cells for medicine...the use of prosthetic devices to substitute for organ and tissue function.\" (Haseltine, 2003) \"...regenerative medicine seeks to understand how and why stem cells, whether derived from human embryos or adult tissues, are able to develop into specialized tissues, and seeks to harness this potential for tissue-replacement therapies that will restore lost function in damaged organs.\" (U.S. National Academy of Sciences, 2002) 15 regenerative medicine can include therapies that do not involve the use of cells (e.g. biosynthetic materials releasing soluble molecules) Focuses on natural components and signal molecules Omits contribution of synthetic materials, e.g. novel biomaterials e No clear definition statement e Includes prosthetic devices. We do not consider prosthetics themselves to constitute RM but rather their combination with other technologies (e.g. bioartificial organs: artificial organs + living cells) e Focuses exclusively on stem cells e Focuses on tissue-replacement, rather than including cell and organ-level therapies as well For the purposes of this study, we (Daar and Greenwood) developed and tested a definition of regenerative medicine through an iterative process of soliciting feedback, revision, and re- testing the definition in a new forum.\" This definition was based on a previously published definition'? and was developed through a number of methods, including literature surveys, public presentations, discussions with audiences, developing grant proposals, and input from experts in the various contributing disciplines.\" follows: We define regenerative medicine as Regenerative Medicine is an emerging interdisciplinary field of research and clinical applications focused on the repair, replacement or regeneration of cells, tissues, or organs to restore impaired function resulting from any cause, including congenital defects, disease, trauma, and aging. It uses a combination of several technological approaches that moves it beyond traditional 16 transplantation and replacement therapies. These approaches may include, but are not limited to, the use of soluble molecules, gene therapy, stem cell transplantation, tissue engineering, and the reprogramming of cell and tissue types. This definition reflects regenerative medicine's goal of restoring impaired function and emphasizes the interdisciplinarity of the field without restricting the technologies that can be combined to achieve this goal. The concepts of repair, replacement, and regeneration contained in this definition will briefly be described with reference to recent developments in the field. One method by which regenerative medicine seeks to restore impaired function is via the repair of damaged tissues. Repair in this case denotes the provision of materials necessary to encourage the body to repair itself.'? The term \"repair\" is often associated with cardiac cell therapy,\u00ae' for instance, although the mechanism by which cells operate to repair the heart remains to be determined.\u00ae* Recent results from the world's largest placebo-controlled study of bone marrow-derived progenitor cell therapy for acute myocardial infarction demonstrate nearly twice the improvement in the heart's pumping ability in patients who received the therapy over the placebo group.\u00ae In another example of repair, researchers injected self- assembling synthetic peptides into the brain of hamsters with severed optical nerves. Jn vivo, the peptides formed a nanofibre scaffold that encouraged brain tissue and nerve regrowth across the gap, and helped to restore sight to the hamsters.** Regenerative medicine also encompasses replacement. While the concept of replacement may at first seem very similar to traditional transplantation and replacement therapies, 17 regenerative medicine extends beyond simple organ replacement (e.g. kidney allotransplantation). The field of regenerative medicine strives to use its interdisciplinary knowledge to achieve solutions to some of the major challenges facing transplantation and replacement therapies today: improving graft survival, avoiding immune rejection, and overcoming donor material shortages.'> Recent work at the University of Alberta, for instance, seeks to overcome the challenge of maintaining long-term insulin independence in patients who receive islet transplants for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.' Islet transplants themselves might be considered standard transplantation. Beyond that, however, researchers have shown that overexpressing a naturally occurring inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) in beta cells improves the engraftment and survival of these cells and reverses diabetes in mice in three days.' Other efforts indicate that it may even be possible to grow insulin- producing pancreatic beta cell lines,\u00ae\u00b0 which would help to overcome current shortages of islets for transplantation.\u00ae\u00b0 Geron, for example, has recently grown islet-like cell clusters from human embryonic stem cells that respond appropriately to sugar levels in terms of producing insulin and glucagon.\u00ae' Regeneration goes a step further than repairing, or simply replacing from the outside, what is damaged. In regeneration, the body is stimulated to produce new, young, cells, tissues, and organs.'\u00ae Much research activity in regenerative medicine is focused on determining the developmental pathways of stem cells with the aim of understanding how to stimulate their differentiation. Human embryonic stem cells have been differentiated to produce such cells as cardiomyocytes, glial cells, neurons, insulin-producing cells, and endothelial cells. It has also been proposed that human embryonic stem cells can act as catalysts when transplanted, 18 to stimulate in vivo tissue regeneration.*\u00ae Small molecules, such as growth factors, are another method to stimulate in vivo regeneration. This is the aim of the NORTHERN trial, a gene therapy trial currently underway at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Canada. This trial is investigating the potential for gene therapy of vascular endothelial growth factor to induce angiogenesis and improve blood flow to the heart in angina patients.\u00ae 1.4.4 Gaps in the Literature Following the literature on global health ethics, science and technology for development, and regenerative medicine, there are three identified gaps in knowledge that will be addressed by this study: 1. The literature supports a moral obligation to address current inequities in global health, and there is growing evidence to support science and technology as one potential contributor to development. To date, however, the field of regenerative medicine has largely focused on potential benefits for industrialized nations to the exclusion of the populations of developing nations. This study will focus specifically on how regenerative medicine could be applied towards improving health in developing countries. This is particularly relevant given that a number of the conditions for which regenerative medicine is most applicable are more prevalent in developing than developed countries. The United Nations Development Programme Task Force on Science, Technology, and Innovation' recommends the use of foresight techniques to inform policy action in developing countries, particularly with respect to emerging fields of science and 19 technology. There has been no use of foresight techniques to systematically identify and prioritize which applications of regenerative medicine have the most potential for improving the health of people in developing countries. This study will use foresight to identify and prioritize the most promising applications of regenerative medicine for improving health in developing countries. The results of this study could provide guidance to developing countries who wish to build capacity in regenerative medicine but who require focused action due to limited resources available for health research. 3. A previous foresight study on health biotechnology and the developing world identified the criteria that were used by experts to determine these promising biotechnologies. This study emphasized the potential for these criteria to inform future assessments of emerging health biotechnologies.** There has been no such determination of criteria for regenerative medicine. This study will identify the criteria used by a panel of experts to determine the most promising applications of regenerative medicine for improving health in developing countries. These criteria could serve as a future guide to assess the potential for emerging regenerative medicine applications to improve health in developing countries, and will additionally explore whether the regenerative medicine applications identified through the foresight study are grounded in the reality of developing countries. 15 SUMMARY OF CHAPTERS In Chapter 2, the methods used to meet this study's research objectives are described. This includes a discussion of the methodological approach, and descriptions of the study 20 participants, data collection and analysis, and research ethics.

CHAPTER2 METHODOLOGY 2.1 INTRODUCTION This chapter contains an explanation of the methods used to accomplish the objectives of this study. First, the design (2.2) of the study is described. In this section, the Delphi method is introduced and the rationale for choosing this method is explained. Second, participant selection (2.3) is discussed. Third, the method of data collection (2.4) is explained for each of the three Delphi rounds. Fourth, the data analysis (2.5) component of the study is described. This section includes a description of the analysis required for each of the two study objectives: e Ranked top ten list (2.5.1) e Decision-making criteria (2.5.2) This chapter concludes with a discussion of the research ethics (2.6) involved with this study. 2.2. DESIGN A modified Delphi method\" was used to create a ranked list of the ten most promising applications of regenerative medicine for improving health in developing countries. The Delphi method, a method often used in technology foresight studies,* is a qualitative research method that uses an iterative, multi-stage process to build consensus among a group of experts regarding a specific issue.\"' In response to a series of questionnaires over several rounds, issues are first identified by the group of experts and are then ranked and commented upon in subsequent rounds.\" The Delphi method is characterized by anonymity in the interaction between the experts, as communication between the group is controlled by the 21 22 researchers, who collect comments from the participants, sort and analyze the responses, and feed back the information to the group.\" In this study, a modified three-round Delphi method* was used with an international panel of experts to build consensus regarding the most promising applications of regenerative medicine for the developing world. The Delphi method was chosen for this study for several reasons. First, the Delphi method has been previously effectively used in technology foresight studies to identify promising areas for research.\" Second, it has the strength of gathering and synthesizing expert opinion in a structured manner, which can avoid potential limitations of more informal methods of expert opinion gathering, such as the dominance of a group discussion by vocal individuals.\"? Third, the Delphi method is well-suited for studying 92.93 such as areas in which there is a lack of information, empirical evidence, or agreement, the area of regenerative medicine for developing countries. Fourth, the Delphi method does not require participants to be in the same physical space, and is thus ideal for use with a group of geographically disparate participants.\" 2.3. PARTICIPANTS The expert panel was composed of an international group of researchers in disciplines contributing to regenerative medicine and clinicians working in fields that will be at the forefront of applying regenerative medicine therapies (Appendix A). In addition to knowledge of the field of regenerative medicine, experts were chosen who were familiar with the issues faced by developing countries, either through current or previous residence in a developing country, or through collaboration with researchers in developing countries. 23 Experts were identified based on an extensive search of published literature, a thorough Internet search, and on the recommendations of individuals involved in the field. A conscious effort was made to balance specialty research areas within regenerative medicine, geographic distribution, and gender. There is no consensus in the literature regarding the appropriate sample size for a Delphi study. The resources available for the study and the scope of the issue under study are listed as two factors to consider when determining the size of the expert panel.' A previous similar study that identified promising health biotechnologies for the developing world used a panel composed of 28 experts.\" Another similar study focused on nanotechnology and the developing world, with a wider scope including health, energy, agriculture, nutrition, water, and the environment, used a panel composed of 63 experts.\u00ae! Due to the focus of regenerative medicine specifically on health-related applications, the multidisciplinary nature of the field, the time commitment required of the participants,?! and previous experience indicating that a number of the experts initially contacted can be expected to withdraw throughout the course of the study,\u00b0! 85 experts were invited to participate. Table 2 shows the composition of the expert panel throughout the course of the study by gender and research focus. The Invited column of this table illustrates the effort made to represent both men and women, as well as different research foci within the field of regenerative medicine. Based on literature and Internet searches, the relative representation of the two genders and the different research foci among the invited experts was felt to be approximately representative of the field as a whole. 24 Table 2 Expert Panel Composition by Gender and Research Focus Invited Round 1 Round 2 Round 3 # (%) # (%) # (%) # (%) Tota!

The columns Round 1, Round 2, and Round 3 show the characteristics of the panellists who completed each of the three rounds of the Delphi study. Of the original 85 invitations, 72 were confirmed to be received and understood and 54 experts accepted and completed Round 1. The final panel was composed of 44 experts, three quarters of whom were male and one 25 quarter of who were female. Women withdrew from the study at a higher rate than men, dropping from 33% among the invitees to 25% by the end of the study. All areas of research focus originally represented among the invitees remained represented on the final expert panel. The expert panel was also composed to represent different geographic regions of the world, in particular developing countries. The geographic distribution of the expert panel members is shown in Table 3. This table shows that of the panellists initially invited to participate, 64% resided in developing countries as listed in the United Nations Human Development Report 2005.'? Among the panellists who completed the third and final round of the study, 77% reside in developing countries. This suggests that panellists from developing countries were less likely to withdraw from the study than those from industrialized nations. It should be noted that geographic region indicates the country of residence of the panellist at the time of the study. Thus, panellists who have immigrated from developing countries but who no longer reside in a developing country were not counted towards the proportion of panellists from developing countries. Of the 44 experts who comprise the final panel, three panellists fall into this category. Throughout the three rounds, the number of panellists from Africa, Australasia, and North America remained constant. North America and Europe had the lowest response rates to the initial invitation to participate, and the European region had the highest number of participants withdraw throughout the course of the study.

Communication with the expert panellists occurred primarily via email, while phone and fax served as alternative and supporting means of contact. Prior to the beginning of the study, potential panellists were sent an information package by regular mail to inform them of their opportunity to participate in an upcoming study (Appendix B). 28 In Round 1, panellists were invited to participate and were asked the following open-ended question: \"What do you think are the clinical applications of regenerative medicine that are the most likely to improve the health of people in developing countries within the next ten years?\" Participants were asked to provide reasons and comments to support their choices. Prior to its dissemination to the panellists, the Round 1 invitation letter (Appendix C) was pilot tested with two researchers external to the panel. In Round 2, the panellists were asked to rank their top ten choices from one to ten (highest to lowest) from a list of 29 applications derived from the first round which were presented in alphabetical order (Appendix D). Panellists were asked to provide reasons to support their rankings. In Round 3, a list of the top 14 applications from Round 2, including a brief summary of the panellists' reasons for each choice, was distributed to the panellists (Appendix E). This list of 14 applications was presented in order from the highest ranked application in Round 2 to the lowest ranked of the top 14 applications from Round 2. Panellists were asked to either agree with the ranking or to re-rank their top ten choices from the list of 14. In addition, panellists were asked to provide concrete examples of any applications they were familiar with. 2.5. DATA ANALYSIS Data was analysed with two main aims: 1) To derive a ranked list of the top ten regenerative medicine applications for improving health in developing countries; 2) To derive a list of the criteria that informed the choices of the expert panellists. 29 2.5.1 Ranked Top Ten List Data analysis occurred following each of the three Delphi rounds. Following Round 1, a complete list of the regenerative medicine applications suggested by the panellists was compiled. Applications were grouped according to common themes, and suggestions that did not fit within the definition of regenerative medicine were omitted. In order to enhance the validity of the results, this analysis was conducted in a group with other researchers in the Canadian Program on Genomics and Global Health. There was agreement among the group regarding the list of 29 distinct regenerative medicine applications derived from the analysis (Appendix D). In addition, this list was reviewed for face validity by two experts in regenerative medicine external to the panel. These two experts were asked to comment on whether the applications were scientifically accurate, distinct, and a part of the field of regenerative medicine. In Round 2, the rankings of each panellist were entered into an Excel spreadsheet that generated a cumulative score for each application (Appendix F). In this spreadsheet, scores of 1 were converted to 10, 2 to 9, 3 to 8, etc., so that the application that received the highest cumulative score would be ranked first. Forty-seven panellists completed the second round, hence the maximum total score an application could receive was 470 (47 x 10). In cases where panellists indicated a tie between two applications, the concerned applications were entered as the same ranking and subsequent-ranked applications were bumped down a position (e.g. two applications ranked in fourth position by the same panellist would each be entered as 4.5 and the fifth-ranked application would be entered as 6). In order to provide an 30 increased number of choices and more accurate results, the top 14 applications were chosen to re-distribute to the panellists for Round 3. Fourteen was considered to be an appropriate cut-off point due to a break between the fourteenth- and fifteenth-ranked applications of 6.5 points. Additionally, there was a desire to limit the number of applications fed back to the panellists to a manageable number. In Round 3, the panellists' rankings were summed to provide the final total score for each application (Appendix G) using the same method as described for Round 2. Forty-four panellists completed Round 3, hence the highest possible score an application could receive was 440 (44 x 10). Concrete examples provided by participants were copied into a separate file and sorted by application. 2.5.2 Decision-Making Criteria Comments provided by the panellists during all three rounds were analyzed using modified thematic analysis\" to determine the criteria that informed their choices. Four overlapping, non-sequential steps were involved in this analysis: 1) Immersion: in-depth familiarization with the raw data; 2) Open coding: segments of data that related to a specific concept were identified and labeled (coded); 3) Constant comparison: codes were compared within and between pages of data to ensure comprehensiveness and consistency; 4) Axial coding: the concepts were grouped into overarching themes. Data analysis was validated through presentation and discussion at a research group meeting of the Canadian Program on Genomics and Global Health in which team members were asked to comment on the 31 appropriateness of the themes with respect to examples of participants' quotes provided in support of each. 2.6 RESEARCH ETHICS Approval for this study was obtained from the Health Sciences I Research Ethics Board at the University of Toronto. This study was considered to be of low risk to the participants for two reasons. First, it focused only on the gathering of opinions rather than on the activities of the participants themselves. Second, there was no in-person contact with the participants. Due to this minimal risk, the Research Ethics Board agreed that written informed consent was not required. Instead, important elements of the informed consent process were contained in the Round 1 letter and response to Round 1 was taken as informed consent. Confidentiality with respect to the individual opinions of the panellists was protected throughout the study. All findings represent the collective opinion of the panel. The researchers have no conflicts of interest to declare. CHAPTER3 RESULTS: TOP TEN REGENERATIVE MEDICINE APPLICATIONS FOR IMPROVING HEALTH IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 3.1 INTRODUCTION This chapter discusses results related to the main research question: 'What are the most promising applications of regenerative medicine for improving health in developing countries within the next ten years?\" The list of the top ten regenerative medicine applications for improving health in developing countries (3.2) is presented and the consensus developed using the Delphi method is discussed. Next, each of the ten regenerative medicine applications is explained in further detail with reference to comments provided by the panellists: e Novel methods of insulin replacement and pancreatic islet cell regeneration for diabetes (3.2.1) e Autologous cells for the regeneration of heart muscle after myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathies (3.2.2) e Immune system enhancement by engineered immune cells and novel vaccination strategies for infectious disease (3.2.3) e Tissue engineered skin substitutes, autologous stem or progenitor cells, intelligent dressings, and other technologies for skin loss due to burns, wounds, and diabetic ulcers (3.2.4) Biocompatible blood substitutes for transfusion requirements (3.2.5) e Umbilical cord blood banking for future cell replacement therapies and other applications (3.2.6) e Tissue engineered cartilage, modified chondrocytes, and other tissue engineering technologies for traumatic and degenerative joint disease (3.2.7) e Gene therapy and stem cell transplants for inherited blood disorders such as thalassemias, sickle cell disease, and hemophilia (3.2.8) e Nerve regeneration technologies using growth factors, stem cells, and synthetic nerve guides for spinal cord and peripheral nerve injuries (3.2.9) e Hepatocyte transplants as replacement therapy for chronic liver diseases or liver failure (3.2.10) Conclusions from these results are also presented (3.3). 32 33 3.2 TOP TEN REGENERATIVE MEDICINE APPLICATIONS FOR IMPROVING HEALTH IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES Table 4 contains the final list of the ten regenerative medicine applications considered by the panellists to be the most promising for improving health in developing countries, along with concrete examples suggested by the panellists. It can be seen from this table that a number of the applications identified by the panellists relate to noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This table also shows, however, that the use of regenerative medicine in developing countries need not be limited to the treatment of noncommunicable diseases, as the panellists also consider applications related to infectious diseases and to injury and trauma to be extremely important.\"? Table 4 additionally shows the score received by each application. There was a high degree of consensus with regard to the top five applications; all panellists except one ranked at least three of the top five applications in their own top five responses. The number one ranked application, \"Novel methods of insulin replacement and pancreatic islet cell regeneration for diabetes\" received 415 points out of a possible maximum of 440 (44 x 10), and was ranked in first position by 35 of the 44 panellists.2\" In Delphi studies, stability of responses from round to round can indicate a strong level of consensus.\"! The top ten responses remained stable from Round 2 to Round 3, and there was small variation in the eleventh- through fourteenth-ranked applications from Round 2 to Round 3. 34 Table 4 Top Ten Regenerative Medicine Applications for Improving Health in Developing Countries Ranking Regenerative Medicine Examples Identified by the Panellists (Score) Application Novel methods of insulin e Bone marrow stem cell transplantation for pancreatic regeneration 1 replacement and pancreatic \u00ab regeneration for transplanted islets 2 (358) (339) (272) 5 (238) (200) 7 (157.5) (121.5) (105.5) 10 (80) diabetes Autologous cells for the regeneration of heart muscle after myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathies Immune system enhancement by engineered immune cells and novel vaccination strategies for infectious disease Tissue engineered skin substitutes, autologous stem or progenitor celis, intelligent dressings, and other technologies for skin loss due to burns, wounds, and diabetic ulcers Biocompatible blood substitutes for transfusion requirements Umbilical cord blood banking for future cell replacement therapies and other applications Tissue engineered cartilage, modified chondrocytes, and other tissue engineering technologies for traumatic and degenerative joint disease Gene therapy and stem cell transplants for inherited blood disorders such as thalassemias, sickle cell disease, and hemophilia Nerve regeneration technologies using growth factors, stem cells, and synthetic nerve guides for spinal cord and peripheral nerve injuries Hepatocyte transplants as replacement therapy for chronic liver diseases or liver failure \u00a2 Cultured insulin-producing cells from embryonic stem cells, pancreatic progenitor cells, or hepatic stem cells \u00ab Genetically engineered cells to stably express insulin and contain a glucose-sensing mechanism \u00ab Myocardial patch for cardiac regeneration Direct injection of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells for cardiac repair \u00a2 Stromal cell injection for myocardial regeneration \u00ab Localized angiogenic factor therapy through controlled release systems or gene therapy \u00bb Genetically engineered immune cells to enhance or repair immune function \u00a2 Single-injection DNA vaccines Bilayered living skin constructs (e.g. Apligraf) e Engineered growth factors (e.g. rbbFGF, rhEGF) applied in conjunction with topical treatments (e.g. SD-Ag-Zn cream) \u00a2 Intelligent dressings composed of a slow-releasing growth hormone polymer e Epithelial cell sprays \u00a2 Polyhemoglobin blood substitutes for overcoming blood shortages and contamination issues e Preserved umbilical cord blood stem cells to provide future cell replacement therapies for diseases such as diabetes, stroke, myocardial ischemia, and Parkinson's disease e Pooled cord blood for the treatment of leukemia e Matrix-induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (MACI) for cartilage repair \u00a2 Tissue engineered cartilage production using mesenchymal stem cells e Genetically-engineered hematopoietic stem cells to restore normal blood production in &-thalassemic patients \u00a2 Synthetic nerve guides to protect regenerating nerves e Embryonic stem cell therapy for spinal cord regeneration \u00ab Growth factor-seeded scaffolds to enhance and direct nerve e Microencapsulation of hepatocytes to prevent immunological reaction \u00ab Derivation of hepatocytes for transplantation from embryonic stem cells e Transdifferentiation of hepatocytes for transplantation from bone marrow cells \"The maximum total score an application could receive was 440. 35 Each of the top ten regenerative medicine applications will be discussed in more detail with reference to comments made by the panellists. 3.2.1 Novel methods of insulin replacement and pancreatic islet cell regeneration for diabetes \"Novel methods of insulin replacement and pancreatic islet cell regeneration for diabetes\" was ranked in first position, and was frequently supported by reference to the high prevalence of diabetes in developing countries and the major health, social, and economic burden that results. Panellists emphasized that controlling diabetes would in turn reduce the incidence of complications such as blindness, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetic ulcers. The panellists noted that repeated insulin treatments are costly and inaccessible to many patients in developing countries. They felt that regenerative medicine therapies, such as bone marrow stem cell transplantation for pancreatic regeneration or microencapsulated islet cells, could increase accessibility by providing a permanent solution and reducing the financial burden resulting from the purchase of insulin. 3.2.2 Autologous cells for the regeneration of heart muscle after myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathies Dramatically increasing rates of cardiovascular diseases in developing countries were cited by panellists in support of the second-ranked application, \"Autologous cells for the regeneration of heart muscle myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathies\". Panellists indicated that myocardial regeneration could be stimulated by injecting autologous cells directly into damaged regions or through other therapies, such as regenerative myocardial 36 patches in which cells are cultivated in sheets and transplanted to damaged parts of the heart. It was noted that such therapies show promising early results, and are being tested in clinical trials in a number of countries. Panellists believed that in addition to saving lives, these therapies could potentially reduce the cost of treating heart failure. The use of autologous cells was emphasized by the panellists due to their advantage of avoiding immune rejection and, hence, costly immunosuppressive regimens. 3.2.3. Immune system enhancement by engineered immune cells and novel vaccination strategies for infectious disease The third-ranked application was \"Immune system enhancement by engineered immune cells and novel vaccination strategies for infectious disease\". Panellists referred to the devastating toli that infectious diseases continue to inflict in developing countries, particularly on the young. According to the panellists, the regeneration or enhancement of the immune system by engineered immune cells and novel vaccination strategies could improve an individual's ability to fight infections and to combat new strains of common diseases. Panellists made specific reference to the importance of addressing HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis, and malaria. 3.2.4 Tissue engineered skin substitutes, autologous stem or progenitor cells, intelligent dressings, and other technologies for skin loss due to burns, wounds, and diabetic ulcers Panellists cited a variety of major health problems in developing countries, such as burns, diabetic ulcers, injuries caused by traffic accidents, and wounds suffered by war victims, which could all be aided by the fourth-ranked application \"Tissue engineered skin 37 substitutes, autologous stem or progenitor cells, intelligent dressings, and other technologies for skin loss\". Panellists made reference to a number of products already on the market, such as the bioartificial skin substitutes Dermagraft, Integra Artificial Skin, and Apligraf. The panellists believed that these and other applications, including intelligent dressings capable of interacting with the wound bed and engineered growth factors for wound regeneration, could reduce morbidity and mortality due to skin loss, improve the quality of life of patients, and reduce costs associated with long-term care and rehabilitation. 3.2.5 Biocompatible blood substitutes for transfusion requirements Panellists felt that the fifth-ranked application \"Biocompatible blood substitutes for transfusion requirements\" could help to alleviate the problem of infectious disease transmission through contaminated blood in developing countries. According to the panellists, blood products are in high demand in developing countries, especially for post- traumatic transfusion requirements, yet these countries are currently facing severe shortages. The major advantage of blood substitutes mentioned by the panellists is their ability to mimic the natural properties of blood while being able to be sterilized, hence avoiding costly screening measures. Panellists cited the example of a polyhemoglobin blood substitute already in use in South Africa. 3.2.6 Umbilical cord blood banking for future cell replacement therapies and other applications The potential for umbilical cord blood banking to provide future cell therapies for a broad range of diseases, including diabetes, stroke, myocardial infarction, and cancer, was referred 38 to by the panellists in support of the fifth-ranked application \"Umbilical cord blood banking for future cell replacement therapies and other applications\". According to the panellists, umbilical cord blood storage facilities already exist in several developing countries, though they emphasized that there should be increased attention devoted to training and supervision in these facilities as well as to establishing affordable public banks. Two major benefits of umbilical cord blood banking, according to the panellists, are the potential to provide autologous cell therapies, and the potential for umbilical cord blood banking to be viewed as more socially acceptable than harvesting stem cells from other sources. 3.2.7 Tissue engineered cartilage, modified chondrocytes, and other tissue engineering technologies for traumatic and degenerative joint disease The sixth-ranked application was \"Tissue engineered cartilage, modified chondrocytes, and other tissue engineering technologies for traumatic and degenerative joint disease\". The panellists indicated that due to malnutrition, trauma, and an aging population, joint diseases are common in developing countries. According to the panellists, current methods for the treatment of cartilage defects are few, expensive, not universally available, and can have major side effects. Panellists felt that regenerative medicine therapies could help to overcome the poor natural healing of cartilaginous defects, and thus, to improve the mobility and economic productivity of patients. One such therapy cited by the panellists was matrix- induced chondrocyte implantation, whereby a bilayer collagen membrane is seeded with chondrocytes and implanted into the defect. 39 3.2.8 Gene therapy and stem cell transplants for inherited blood disorders such as thalassemias, sickle cell disease, and hemophilia \"Gene therapy and stem cell transplants for inherited blood disorders such as thalassemias, sickle cell disease, and hemophilia\" was ranked in eighth position, and was frequently supported by reference to the high rates of inherited blood disorders in developing countries and their drain on health resources due to the need for repeated transfusions and hospital visits. The panellists felt that gene therapy and stem cell transplants, such as genetically- engineered hematopoietic stem cells to restore normal blood production in 8-thalassemic patients, are technically feasible and could lead to improved survival and quality of life in patients in developing countries, including a large number of children. 3.2.9 Nerve regeneration technologies using growth factors, stem cells, and synthetic nerve guides for spinal cord and peripheral nerve injuries According to the panellists, nerve injury and death due to accidents, trauma, violence, and infectious disease are a major source of morbidity in developing countries, and pose a large burden to the health care system. Panellists believed that the ninth-ranked application \"Nerve regeneration technologies using growth factors, stem cells, and synthetic nerve guides for spinal cord and peripheral nerve injuries\", is technically feasible and could offer better rehabilitation and reduced disability costs following severe trauma. Panellists cited examples such as embryonic stem cell therapy for spinal cord regeneration, synthetic nerve guides to protect regenerating nerves, and growth factor-seeded scaffolds to enhance and direct nerve regeneration. 40 3.2.10 Hepatocyte transplants as replacement therapy for chronic liver diseases or liver failure Widespread Hepatitis B and C leading to liver disease and liver failure in developing countries was cited by panellists in support of the tenth-ranked application \"Hepatocyte transplants as replacement therapy for chronic liver diseases or liver failure\". According to the panellists, the best current treatment method, liver transplantation, is expensive and is limited by a shortage of donor organs for transplantation. Panellists felt that hepatocyte transplantation to replace and regenerate cells in the diseased liver could help to overcome these limitations. Novel methods of deriving hepatocytes for transplantation, such as from embryonic stem cells or transdifferentiated from bone marrow cells, could help to overcome donor shortages, while microencapsulating hepatocytes with novel biomaterials would help to avoid immune rejection and costly immunosuppressive regimens associated with liver transplantation. 3.3 CONCLUSION The expert panel, therefore, identified the ten applications of regenerative medicine that they consider to be the most promising for improving health in developing countries. These ten applications address a range of noncommunicable diseases as well as injury and trauma. They also highlight, however, the importance of regenerative medicine therapies for the treatment of infectious diseases, an application that has not been a major focus of the regenerative medicine community to date. CHAPTER 4 RESULTS: DECISION-MAKING CRITERIA 4.1. INTRODUCTION Throughout the Delphi study the panellists were asked to provide reasons and comments to support their choices. The majority of the panellists (39 of 54 in Round 1 and 36 of 47 in Round 2) did so, many providing extensive and thoughtful discussions to justify their responses. This chapter addresses the secondary objective of this study, to identify and describe the criteria that were used by the expert panel members to determine the most promising applications of regenerative medicine for improving health in developing countries within the next ten years. The taxonomy of decision-making criteria (4.2) summarizes the Six criteria that were identified based on the panellists' comments. In the following sections, the six criteria are each explained in detail with reference to comments made by the panellists: Burden (4.2.1) Impact (4.2.2) Feasibility (4.2.3) Affordability (4.2.4) Acceptability (4.2.5) Indirect benefits (4.2.6) Conclusions related to these results are also presented (4.3). 4.2 TAXONOMY OF DECISION-MAKING CRITERIA Based on the analysis of the comments provided by the panellists, six criteria were identified that informed their choices. 1. Burden: Will the application address some of the most pressing health needs of developing countries? 41 42 2. Impact: Will the application be an improvement over currently existing treatment options and have a clear impact towards improving health in developing countries? 3. Feasibility: Can the application reasonably be developed and deployed within a time frame of ten years? 4. Affordability: Will the application be affordable to develop and/or use in developing countries? 5. Acceptability: Is the application safe, and socially, ethically, and legally acceptable? 6. Indirect Benefits: Does the application provide benefits, such as capacity building or economic benefits, that could indirectly improve health in developing countries? A number of concepts were identified under each of the six criteria. These concepts provide a more complete understanding of the criteria used by the panellists to make their decisions. Table 5 summarizes the criteria, the concepts contained under each criterion, and the number of occurrences of each criterion in the comments provided by the panellists. It should be noted that while the number of occurrences provides for a more complete picture of the focus of the panellists' comments, it should not be presumed that frequency is indicative of the relative importance of each of these criteria to the panellists. Table 5 Decision-Making Criteria and Associated Concepts Criteria and Concepts # of Occurrences BURDEN 159 e Prevalence of disease e Impact of disease IMPACT 141 e Limitations of existing treatment options e Health benefits e Population affected 43 FEASIBILITY 95 e Promise of results e Complexity of development and use AFFORDABILITY 55 ACCEPTABILITY 20 e Safety e Ethical considerations e Social considerations e Legal considerations INDIRECT BENEFITS 7 e Economic benefits e Benefits for science and technology capacity-building The criteria and their associated concepts are explained below using verbatim quotes from the panellists. 4.2.1 Burden Whether a regenerative medicine application would address some of the most pressing health needs of developing countries played a role in the decision-making process of the panellists. Two concepts were identified under this theme: prevalence of disease and impact of disease. Panellists often made reference to the prevalence of particular diseases in the developing world to justify selecting a particular regenerative medicine application. Thalassemia major is among the commonest genetic diseases worldwide...Unfortunately, incidence of thalassemia major is highest in developing nations of the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Mediterranean region, and Middle East. Cardiovascular disease has become increasingly prevalent in the developing world, and together with other noncommunicable diseases (such as diabetes), accounts for approximately 60% of all deaths in the developing world. 44 In addition to the prevalence of a particular disease, panellists indicated that the impact of the disease, in terms of morbidity, mortality, and social and economic costs, was a factor affecting their decisions. Diabetes and its complications are catastrophes, eating a vast chunk of the meager budget given to health in developing countries. Kidney diseases leading to ESRD [end-stage renal disease] and need for dialysis and transplantation take a heavy toll on lives in this part of the world where extended families pool their resources for survival - such a disease in one breadwinner can have devastating repercussions for many lives. 4.2.2 Impact The impact that a regenerative medicine application could have in terms of providing an improvement over existing treatment options and producing a clear benefit towards improving health in developing countries was the second criterion identified that informed the panellists' choices. Three concepts are contained under this theme: limitations of existing treatment options, health benefits, and population affected. Panellists highlighted limitations of the currently available treatment options in order to justify the need to develop new regenerative medicine therapies. These limitations include a lack of effective treatment options, Approximately 25% of diabetic and venous wounds do not heal with standard wound care alone...Patients in this situation face the severe threat of persistent wounds becoming ischaemic, a condition that may lead to eventual limb amputation. the high cost of currently available treatments, 45 In the developing world, the supply of insulin needed to treat a type 1 diabetic is not readily affordable to many individuals. Conventional transplantation is also not an option as it requires the tissue from many cadavers and subsequent rejection therapy which is very costly. and a shortage of the materials or personnel necessary to carry out currently available treatments. There is a severe lack of organs for transplantation as well as the necessary Skilled personnel. In addition to highlighting the deficiencies of existing therapies, the panellists considered the health benefits that a given regenerative medicine application could provide. Up to now, the average wound healing time in superficial or deep second- degree burns and donor sites were shortened about 2 to 4 days than before with the treatment of growth factors. The results will benefit not only for harvesting and autografting of patient's own skin, but also for shortening the length of Stays in hospital. Blood substitutes will keep patients alive until their bone marrow regenerates enough red blood cells to take over the function. It can be sterilized and therefore avoid the problem of infections and also the need for very costly screening methods. Panellists also considered the number of people who would be affected by the regenerative medicine applications. If tissue engineered skin substitutes or stem cells could be made available, it would save the lives of many patients in developing countries. 4.2.3 Feasibility Whether it is feasible that a particular regenerative medicine application could be developed and deployed in developing countries within a time frame of ten years was the third criterion 46 that informed the choices of the panellists. Within this theme, two concepts were identified: promise of results, and complexity of development and use of the application. Panellists discussed promising research and clinical results that show the feasibility of certain regenerative medicine applications. Panellists indicated that some applications are already in clinical use, Skin stem cells [are] already being used successfully, e.g. for victims of Bali bombing. while others are showing positive early results. Today, there are some hopeful preliminary results using autologous bone marrow stem cells in terminal Chagas patients, and it is expected the use of other types of cellular cardiomyoplasty soon. Panellists also referred to research results that were not as promising in order to justify awarding certain applications a lower ranking. Although maybe the application I personally find more challenging, exciting, and promising, it was placed in this status because...there will not be much specific and concrete results (i.e. clinically applicable) within ten years. Considerations of feasibility additionally included how complex the regenerative medicine application would be to develop and use in developing countries. Panellists mentioned such factors as the technical skills required to carry out a specific therapy, the simplicity of developing a certain technology, and the infrastructure requirements necessary to support the technology. ...the technology is easily mastered, and the clinicians who will undertake the Job are easily trained in a short time. 47 This treatment is ranked low on the list because, although it is highly applicable, the technique is invasive and the technology complicated. 4.2.4 Affordability Whether the regenerative medicine application would be affordable to develop and/or use in developing countries was another criterion used by the panellists in identifying and ranking the applications. Participants indicated that certain regenerative medicine applications could be carried out at low cost, The costs, particularly of harvesting cells and culturing them, is not high. ...@ Strong interest in cell therapies, particularly based on their relatively inexpensive application to major problems and ability to set these up quickly and cheaply without dependence on expensive technology. and that some regenerative medicine applications could be carried out more affordably than currently existing methods of management and treatment. Successful application would dramatically lower the cost of treatment for an individual who has, for instance, experienced a myocardial infarction. The projected expense of carrying out certain regenerative medicine applications was also occasionally used as a justification to rank these applications lower. Unless the technology here becomes far cheaper than now, I do not see it to be of mass scale use. 48 4.2.5 Acceptability Though mentioned less frequently by the panellists, some made comments that indicated that the safety and social, ethical, and legal acceptability of an application was a factor affecting their choices. Panellists mentioned that certain regenerative medicine therapies are safe for use, and additionally that some show an improvement in safety over current treatment methods. DNA vaccines...can be delivered in a manner very similar to standard vaccines with much greater safety. Panellists also made reference to critical safety work that still needs to be carried out with respect to certain applications. Essential work still has to be done to establish the long term safety of the technique. Social considerations mentioned were related to the variety of cultural views that exist regarding the acceptability of transplantation. Some panellists indicated that certain regenerative medicine therapies could help to avoid controversy associated with conventional transplantation. Resistance, cultural and religious, to cadaveric and live organ procurement remains a big impediment that, in my opinion, can be addressed via xenotransplants. Ethical considerations were mentioned with respect to stem cell sources, with panellists indicating that certain methods of deriving stem cells for use in therapies would be ethically more acceptable than others. 49 Bone marrow derived hematopoietic stem cells from adults are much more easily available and at the same time without the ethical problems of embryonic stem cells. Legal considerations were not explained in depth by those panellists who indicated that they played a role in their decision-making. These panellists did explain, however, that \"the approaches described above seem to be more feasible and acceptable legally\". 4.2.6 Indirect Benefits A small number of panellists made comments that indicated that whether regenerative medicine applications could provide benefits capable of indirectly improving health was a factor affecting their choices. Two concepts were identified under this theme: economic benefits, and benefits for science and technology capacity-building. Panellists indicated that certain regenerative medicine applications could have large economic benefits for developing countries generally, The economic impact in developing countries may be extraordinary. and more specifically in terms of increasing the economic productivity of certain segments of the population in developing countries. Productivity in old age will increase. This will not only save sight, but will increase production in this young age group. 50 Additionally, some panellists felt that investing in and using regenerative medicine therapies could help to build capacity in science and technology in developing countries. ..it will raise the skills and knowledge of researchers and practitioners and create scientific centres of excellence. ... and build confidence to the community in the power of science and technology 4.3. CONCLUSION Based on the analysis of comments provided by the panellists throughout the study, therefore, six criteria were identified that informed their choices: burden, impact, feasibility, affordability, acceptability, and indirect benefits. These criteria lend support to the top ten regenerative medicine applications identified by the panellists, as they illustrate the complexity of factors taken into account in their choices and suggest that the panellists' choices were grounded in the reality of developing countries. CHAPTERS DISCUSSION 5.1 INTRODUCTION This chapter discusses the results of the study in terms of their relevance to developing countries, and provides recommendations for both developing countries wishing to build capacity in regenerative medicine and developed countries that wish to support these capacity-building initiatives. First, key findings are summarized (5.2), and their contribution to critical gaps in knowledge are discussed (5.3). Second, the implications of these results for policy and practice in both developing and developed countries are discussed (5.4). Third, the feasibility of developing countries building capacity in regenerative medicine is addressed (5.5) with reference to current regenerative medicine activities in developing countries and to the cost of new health-related technologies. Fourth, the limitations of this study are outlined (5.6). Finally, recommendations for future research are described (5.7) and conclusions are presented (5.8). 5.2 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS This study accomplished two objectives: (1) To identify and prioritize the ten most promising applications of regenerative medicine for improving health in developing countries by using a consensus-building method with an international panel of experts; (2) To identify and describe the criteria that informed the choices of the international panel of experts. 5.2.1 Top Ten Regenerative Medicine Applications for Improving Health in Developing Countries 51 52 A total of forty-four scientists and clinicians completed all three rounds of the Delphi study. Twenty-six different countries were represented on the international expert panel, with 77% of the panellists residing in developing countries. The panellists identified the ten most promising applications of regenerative medicine for improving health in developing countries. The applications chosen by the panellists show that they consider regenerative medicine to be potentially relevant to noncommunicable diseases as well as to injury and trauma and to infectious diseases in developing countries. The top three applications were: novel methods of insulin replacement and pancreatic islet cell regeneration for diabetes; autologous cells for of heart muscle after myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathies; and immune system enhancement by engineered immune cells and novel vaccination strategies for infectious disease. 5.2.2. Decision-Making Criteria Six criteria were identified that informed the decision-making of the panellists: burden, impact, feasibility, affordability, acceptability, and indirect benefits. These criteria provide insight into the reasoning of the panellists. They indicate that the panellists considered the health needs of developing countries along with whether particular regenerative medicine applications are realistic and affordable. Additionally, the panellists were concerned with factors outside of those relevant to direct clinical application, such as the ethical, legal, and social acceptability of regenerative medicine technologies and whether any indirect benefits to society and health could be derived from their use. 53 5.3. CONTRIBUTION TO CRITICAL GAP IN KNOWLEDGE This study addressed three gaps in knowledge. First, the field of regenerative medicine has largely focused to date on the patient populations of industrialized nations\"! to the exclusion of those in the developing world. The results of this study present the perspective of developing countries for the first time. This study focused specifically on how regenerative medicine might be of relevance to developing countries and introduced the concept that developing countries could potentially benefit from advances in regenerative medicine. This is of particular relevance given that a number of the conditions for which regenerative medicine is considered to be most applicable, in particular noncommunicable diseases, occur at higher rates in developing than developed countries. Second, although foresight has been recommended by the United Nations Development Programme Task Force on Science, Technology, and Innovation\u00ae as a tool to inform policy- making with respect to emerging technologies in developing countries, there has been no prior use of foresight techniques to systematically identify and prioritize which applications of regenerative medicine have the most potential to improve the health of people in developing countries. This study is the first to conduct such a foresight study for regenerative medicine and the developing world. Through a structured technology foresight study using the Delphi method, a list of the most promising applications of regenerative medicine for improving health in developing countries was developed. Such a list could provide guidance to developing countries to help focus policy aimed at developing and using regenerative medicine therapies. Focused policy is particularly necessary in developing countries given the limited resources they have available to devote to health research. 54 Third, a previous foresight study that identified promising health biotechnologies for developing countries emphasized that the criteria used by a panel of experts to determine these promising biotechnologies could inform future assessments of emerging health biotechnologies.** Similar criteria for regenerative medicine, however, have not been previously identified. This study is the first to identify the criteria that were used by a panel of international experts to determine the most promising applications of regenerative medicine for improving health in developing countries. These criteria were identified based on the analysis of comments provided by the panellists throughout the study, and reinforce the top ten regenerative medicine applications by suggesting that the factors considered by the experts in making their choices were grounded in the reality of developing countries. Additionally, these criteria could be used in future assessments of emerging regenerative medicine applications. 5.4. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE In addition to filling gaps in knowledge, the results of this study have several implications for policy and practice. The comments provided by the expert panellists throughout this study indicate that they believe that regenerative medicine could be a realistic option for improving health in developing countries. These results may help to combat skepticism regarding the applicability and affordability of regenerative medicine therapies for developing countries, and may help to direct research focus towards developing regenerative medicine therapies that are applicable, affordable, and accessible to developing countries. 55 Science and technology foresight studies such as this one can be a valuable tool to inform policy decisions regarding which strategic research areas to pursue, particularly given the fast pace of development of science and technology.\" In a study of eight countries and their experiences using foresight, Martin\" found that the benefits of science and technology foresight can include: encouraging long-term thinking; fostering better coordination between stakeholders; encouraging innovation by increasing communication; and helping to develop a shared vision of the future and commitment to specific goals.\" Thus, the results of this foresight study on regenerative medicine and the developing world may help to encourage collaboration and coordination among the diverse stakeholders involved in regenerative medicine, and may help to promote a shared focus on the health needs of developing countries. In addition, the results of this study have specific implications for both developing and developed countries. Recommendations are also presented for developing countries who wish to engage in regenerative medicine research and application, and developed countries who wish to support such capacity-building initiatives. 5.4.1 Implications and Recommendations for Developing Countries The results of this study indicate that, in the opinion of a panel of international experts, regenerative medicine could be a valuable area to pursue to help address certain pressing health needs in developing countries. These results may serve as a guide for developing countries to help target policy aimed at initiating or developing further their existing capacity in regenerative medicine. Given that developing countries often have very limited resources 56 to devote to scientific research and to healthcare, a consensus list representing the opinion of a group of international experts in regenerative medicine can serve as a useful starting point to focus efforts on particular, promising regenerative medicine applications. For developing countries that wish to use these results to inform their activities in regenerative medicine, several recommendations are presented. First, it is recommended that the governments of developing countries evaluate the list of promising regenerative medicine applications in their own national contexts, drawing on a broad range of interest groups such as religious leaders and community representatives, in order to determine desirable areas of focus and priority for their own country. The six criteria identified in this study could serve as a framework for this evaluation. Particular areas of discussion could include the burden of disease, the potential impact of the regenerative medicine application, and the acceptability of a given regenerative medicine application to the general population of that country. Second, it is recommended that countries begin by developing a niche of expertise within the field of regenerative medicine, whether through the use of a certain set of technologies or a specialization in particular diseases, in order to develop strong expertise and to focus efforts and resources effectively. Case studies of successful health biotechnology sectors in seven developing countries found that defining a niche area is important for developing countries given their limited resources available for technological development. Such a strategy can enable a country to prioritize specific areas and to build on existing strengths.\" 57 Finally, it is recommended that governments and academic institutions in developing countries promote strong linkages and collaborations in order to build capacity in regenerative medicine. Such collaborations, between institutions, between developing countries, and with industrialized nations, may encourage both the exchange of knowledge and the development of expertise as well as resource sharing. Another lesson identified in case studies of successful health biotechnology sectors in developing countries is that collaborations, for instance between academic institutions and private organizations or between academic institutions and public research institutes, were particularly important to the generation of products to address local health needs.\u00b0 In the case of regenerative medicine where services, for instance cell therapy services, will be a key part of emerging therapies, collaborations between academic institutions and the public health sector could be particularly relevant. 5.4.2 Implications and Recommendations for Developed Countries The results of this study may help to raise awareness among the governments of developed countries, aid organizations, and the regenerative medicine community regarding the growing epidemic of noncommunicable diseases in developing countries and the potential for regenerative medicine to address this and other pressing health needs in developing countries. These results may serve as a guide for the policy formulation of developed country governments and of international and bilateral aid agencies. They may also help to balance efforts in regenerative medicine research away from a sole focus on the populations of developed countries to include considerations of how regenerative medicine could additionally benefit the populations of developing countries. 58 For developed countries that wish to pursue the implications of these results and support the activities of developing countries in regenerative medicine, several actions are proposed. First, it is recommended that developed countries devote a portion of their research and development spending to challenges facing the developing world. Such a commitment from the governments of industrialized nations would provide the resources to pursue capacity- building initiatives in regenerative medicine in developing countries and would provide incentives to develop regenerative medicine therapies that are relevant, accessible and affordable to the developing world. Second, an initiative on Global Grand Challenges for Regenerative Medicine is recommended. This proposal is based on the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation/Foundation for the NIH/Wellcome Trust/CIHR Grand Challenges in Global Health,\" and would focus the regenerative medicine community towards addressing the key scientific and technological barriers to producing regenerative medicine therapies that are applicable, affordable, and accessible to the developing world. The Grand Challenges in Global Health Program is a relevant model to build upon as it is dedicated to improving health in developing countries and currently funds one project directly related to the results of this study: engineering immune cells capable of enhancing the immune response in patients infected with HIV.\" One source of potential funding could be through research and development funds earmarked specifically for challenges facing the developing world as mentioned above. 59 Third, developed world governments and academic institutions should promote collaborations, such as training courses, joint grant-writing initiatives, and research partnerships in order to share knowledge and expertise in regenerative medicine with developing countries. Additionally, formal government programs to encourage knowledge repatriation by skilled diaspora communities from developing countries should be created. A recent study of scientific diaspora communities in Canada identified a strong desire on the part of these communities to give back to their home countries in ways that go further than traditional financial remittances.\"' Though this study identified a huge potential in the diaspora communities living in Canada to help build science and technology capacity in the developing world, it also identified a lack of current government support and mechanisms by which to facilitate and support this knowledge repatriation. 5.5 FEASIBLITY OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BUILDING CAPACITY IN REGENERATIVE MEDICINE The ability of developing countries to feasibly build capacity in regenerative medicine is supported by a recent survey that identified regenerative medicine research and development activity currently underway in 31 low- and middle-income countries.\" Table 6 presents a summary of these findings, indicating for each country whether regenerative medicine activity was found in any of five areas: dedicated government funding, goods and services, companies, publications, and academic institutions. India's federal government, for instance, has launched a national stem cell research program that establishes six research clusters in six cities across the country. Indeed, the charity hospital and WHO Collaborating Centre for the Prevention of Blindness, the L.V. Prasad Eye Institute, has treated blindness in over 125 patients with adult stem cell therapy for corneal repair. China has invested heavily in its Key 60 Project of State High-Tech \"Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering for Regenerative Medicine\", and the Chinese Tissue Engineering Research and Development Centre has 14 pending patents. The Brazilian government, meanwhile, has invested US$4.3 million to conduct a three-year clinical trial of autologous stem cell therapy for the treatment of heart disease.\" Table 6 Regenerative Medicine Activities in Low- and Middle-Income Countries\" Dedicated Goods & Companies Publications Academic Government Services Institutions Funding Brazil Vv Vv China Vv Vv <|/</< <|/< <|[< |< J/< <|</<|/< Russia Belarus Iran Latvia Lithuania Pakistan Romania Saudi Arabia Serbia T Ukraine Cuba has no private companies, certain public sector institutions in Cuba carry out activities that are characteristic of private sector firms in other countries. The Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Centre (CIGB), for instance, is currently engaged in clinical trials of their product Citoprot P which induces tissue regeneration in diabetic ulcers, and has conducted pilot gene therapy clinical trials for lower limb ischemia and advanced myocardial ischemia.\" 61 Note: Cell therapy services are provided in Barbados, Dominican Republic, and Ecuador, but are backed by American physicians and are not supported by publications. Since these isolated occurrences are the only regenerative medicine activity in these countries, they were not considered significant enough to include. In terms of feasibility of implementation, it should be noted that almost all Asian, Latin American, and some African countries already carry out organ transplantation,\" and that certain regenerative medicine therapies, such as cell therapy, may be technically much simpler than traditional transplantation. The cost of new health-related technologies is an important issue for developing countries, as governments and individuals often have very limited resources, and cost is intricately linked to access to treatment. Although it is too premature to provide cost analyses for applications of regenerative medicine, we must recognize that affordability will be a key determinant of the impact that regenerative medicine has on the general population of developing countries. It is possible to speculate that if developing countries themselves are active in regenerative medicine, they might have a greater motivation than industrialized nations to design affordable and accessible products. Studies of biotechnology sectors in developing countries have shown that local innovation in science and technology can lead to more affordable treatments for the populations of developing countries. For instance, when the Indian biotechnology company Biocon began selling their human recombinant insulin product on the market in India, the amount they charged for one SmL vial of insulin was almost half of that charged by Eli Lily and Novo Nordisk. In another case, India's Shantha Biotechnics has developed a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine that sells for only 0.4 USD per dose as compared to imported vaccines which sell for 8-10 USD per dose.** It is estimated that drug production costs in India are approximately 50% less than those in the United States. 62 Certain manufacturers in developing countries also recognize the large market presented by the poor in developing countries, and specifically target this market with low-cost products suited to their health needs.'\" 5.6 LIMITATIONS Despite the potential benefits of this work and the regenerative medicine activity already underway in developing countries, there are several limitations of this study: selection bias, social desirability bias, bias inherent to the chosen study method, and generalizability. Each of these limitations will be discussed in turn. The first limitation, selection bias, is an inherent bias in the selection of the participants. The expert panellists who were the most likely to be directly affected by the results of this study may have been those who were the most willing to participate and the most likely to complete the study. It is the case, however, that those who are the most involved in the field of regenerative medicine are likely to be the most knowledgeable regarding recent developments and potential future applications of the field. The second limitation of this study is social desirability bias. The panellists may have been influenced in their responses either by what they felt the researchers wanted to hear, by what their research community, academic institution, or company supported, or by what they felt was the most politically correct response. Though the degree to which the panellists may have been affected cannot be determined, the detailed and reflective comments many 63 panellists provided to support their responses suggests that any social desirability bias was most likely minor. The third limitation is bias related to the method chosen for the study. Though the Delphi method has many benefits, there are also certain limitations to the method itself. The consensus building that is a strength of the Delphi method is also a weakness. The focus on 101 and may result in group consensus does not allow for the elaboration of personal opinions, a watered down version of detailed individual opinions in order to achieve agreement.\" Additionally, the Delphi method explores only the issue addressed in the research question and does not allow for a discussion of that issue in a broader context. The focus and consensus derived from this study, however, is also a strength as it presents a clear list of the regenerative medicine applications deemed most promising by scientists and clinicians, which can then be used in broader stakeholder groups to focus a discussion regarding the acceptability and relative importance of these applications in the context of other health sector priorities. The final limitation of this study may result if attempts are made to regard the results as generalizable. The results represent the opinion of the scientists and clinicians involved in this study, and consensus opinion among these experts should not be presumed to indicate generalizability. The aim of this study was not to produce generalizable results, but rather to focus on the opinion of a panel of experts knowledgeable about regenerative medicine. This limitation does not, however, undermine the results of this study as they present a consensus 64 list based on the opinions of experts that may be useful as a guide for discussion and policy development. 5.7 FUTURE RESEARCH To further advance this research and fill the empirical gap regarding the potential impact and benefits of regenerative medicine for developing countries, two future areas of research are suggested. First, a study involving interviews with key informants in developing countries could be carried out in order to understand how the list of promising regenerative medicine applications fits into the broader health sector priorities of developing countries. Such a study would allow for a more complex discussion of individual regenerative medicine applications than was achievable with the Delphi method in order to consider the results in the broader health context of developing countries. This research could also explore how key informants view the promise of these regenerative medicine applications in comparison with other health priorities, such as public health initiatives, and with respect to other technologies, such as biotechnology and nanotechnology. Key informants such as Health and Science and Technology ministers, clinicians, non-governmental organization workers, and community representatives would help to identify the relative importance of each regenerative medicine application and potential areas that require attention prior to implementing regenerative medicine therapies, such as infrastructure and _ policy requirements, and the training of skilled personnel. 65 Another area of future research would be to conduct detailed case studies of the regenerative medicine innovation systems in developing countries that have successfully built capacity in regenerative medicine. Such a study could help to highlight strategies and conditions that can contribute to the successful application of regenerative medicine in the developing world. These results would provide useful information for developing countries who wish to build capacity in regenerative medicine, and the opportunity to learn from the experiences of other developing countries that have been successful in doing so. A similar study on the health biotechnology systems of seven developing countries was recently completed.\" This study identified six core lessons, which highlighted key areas of focus to promote health biotechnology in developing countries: (1) Political will; (2) Individual leadership; (3) Defining niche areas; (4) Close linkages; (5) Enterprise creation; and (6) Intellectual property legislation. These researchers found that biotechnology can be successfully harnessed by developing countries to address health needs and reduce global health inequities. 5.8 CONCLUSION This study identified the ten most promising regenerative medicine applications for improving health in developing countries by conducting a consensus-building exercise with an international panel of experts in regenerative medicine. Additionally, the criteria used by the expert panel to determine the most promising applications of regenerative medicine for developing countries were identified and described. This is one of the first studies to highlight the potential relevance of regenerative medicine for developing countries, and the first to systematically identify and prioritize which applications of regenerative medicine are the most promising for improving health in developing countries. It is hoped that these 66 results will help to ensure that as the field of regenerative medicine continues to evolve and progress, patients in the developing world in addition to those in the industrialized world experience its benefits. As stated by Bill Gates at the World Health Assembly 2005, \"Getting the intervention to the people who need it should never be an afterthought; it should be built into the design of the new discovery. At the very outset, researchers should be seeking interventions that are not only effective, but also inexpensive to produce, easy to distribute, and simple to administer\".'\" REFERENCES 10. 11. 12.

APPENDIX B: PRELIMINARY INFORMATION LETTER Dear [Name], As you may be aware, much of the work that we do at the University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics aims to identify how emerging technologies can help improve the health of people in developing countries and reduce global health inequities. We have been very impressed by your work, which is relevant to the study mentioned below. We will soon be writing to you to ask you to join a select group of experts for a study similar to the one described in the enclosed paper published in Nature Genetics in 2002 and its accompanying report. The new study that we will soon be sending you details of will be to identify the top 10 applications of regenerative medicine that are most likely to help improve the heath of people in developing countries in the next 10 years. Your participation should require less than 30 minutes of your time on 3 separate occasions. As an expert member of the panel, your name will be identified as such in the publications resulting from this study. We hope that you will consider sharing your expertise with us. We will be contacting you shortly via email with further details. With best wishes, Abdallah Public Health Sciences Collaborative Program in Bioethics, Joint Centre for Bioethics Professor of Surgery Institute of Medical Science University of Toronto University of Toronto Director, Program in Applied Ethics and Biotechnology University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics Director for Ethics and Policy McLaughlin Centre for Molecular Medicine University of Toronto 78 APPENDIX C: ROUND 1 LETTER Dear [Name], [Personal Note] The University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics invites you to participate as an expert panel member in a study to explore the potential for regenerative medicine to improve the health of people in developing countries. Your experience would be an invaluable addition to this panel. Your participation will require less than 30 minutes on three separate occasions to respond to questions via email. This study is based on the Delphi process, which we will carry out over three rounds. This is a method that builds group consensus on a specific issue. If you agree to participate, you will become a member of a select group of distinguished individuals who will provide their expert opinion. You will be identified as an expert panellist in the publications resulting from this study. The results of this research will be of great value and will be disseminated widely. We have previously performed a very successful similar study on biotechnology. That study, which was published in Nature Genetics and as separate report (http://www.utoronto.ca/jcb/genomics/documents/toptenreportfinal.pdf), showed the potential for biotechnology to improve health in developing countries, challenged common assumptions regarding the applicability and affordability of innovative technologies for developing countries, and helped shape the policies of governments and funding agencies towards biotechnology and global health research. We hope that this study can do the same for regenerative medicine. For the purpose of this study the definition of Regenerative Medicine is: an emerging interdisciplinary field of research and clinical applications focused on the repair, replacement or regeneration of cells, tissues, or organs to restore impaired function resulting from any cause, including congenital defects, disease and trauma. It uses a combination of several technological approaches that moves it beyond traditional transplantation and replacement therapies. These approaches may include, but are not limited to, the use of stem cells, soluble molecules, genetic engineering, tissue engineering, and advanced cell therapy. This is ROUND 1 of the Delphi study. If you would like to participate, please respond to the following question: \"What do you think are the clinical applications of regenerative medicine that are the most likely to improve the health of people in developing countries within the next ten years?\" We welcome as many examples of promising regenerative medicine clinical applications as you wish to provide. We anticipate that each panellist will include between three and five clinical applications in their response. Please include reasons and comments along with your choices. 79 80 Please submit your response soon but not later than March 31, 2005 by replying to this message via email. We greatly look forward to your participation and very much appreciate the time you have taken. Your involvement will help to ensure that the benefits of regenerative medicine are distributed equitably worldwide. Should you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact one of us. Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. Should you wish to withdraw at any time, you are welcome to do so without question. If you do agree to participate, your name will be published among the list of expert panel members. This is necessary to support the validity of this work. All reporting and disclosure of results, however, will be attributed collectively to the panel and at no point will your name be directly attributed to an individual opinion. This study is based solely on opinion-gathering. As such, we anticipate that there will be no direct risks or benefits to you as a result of your participation in this study. Your response to Round 1 will indicate that you understand this study and that you are willing to participate as an expert panel member. With best wishes, Dr. ABDALLAH S.

We have obtained a list of 29 applications by sorting and categorizing the responses from all the panellists who participated in the first round. In this second round, we now ask you to select and rank, from the list below, the top ten applications of regenerative medicine that you believe are the most promising for improving health in developing countries within the next ten years. This will only take a few minutes of your time. To complete this quickly, all you need to do is: 1. Read the categories listed below, which have been arranged alphabetically. 2. Select your top ten choices from the list by typing a number from 1 to 10 on the line beside the category (1= your first choice, 2= your second choice, etc., in the order of the applications you consider to be most important for developing countries). Leave the categories you do not choose untouched. 3. Please provide reasons for your choices in the space below each category that you select. 4. Please send in your response as soon as possible, but no later than June 17, by replying to this message by email.

Daar Heather Greenwood Director, Canadian Program on Genomics M.Sc. Candidate and Global Health Collaborative Program in Bioethics University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics | University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics a.daar@utoronto.ca jcb.regqmed@utoronto.ca 1. NOVEL METHODS OF INSULIN REPLACEMENT AND PANCREATIC ISLET CELL REGENERATION FOR DIABETES Diabetes is a major social and economic problem in developing countries. Controlling this disease would in turn reduce the incidence of complications such as blindness, heart disease, and chronic kidney disease. Novel methods of insulin replacement and pancreatic islet cell regeneration are technically feasible and would bypass the need for repeated insulin injections, which are costly and inaccessible to many in developing countries. 2. AUTOLOGOUS CELLS FOR THE REGENERATION OF HEART MUSCLE AFTER MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND CARDIOMYOPATHIES (INCLUDING CHAGAS' DISEASE) 84 85 Rates of cardiovascular diseases are increasing dramatically in developing countries. Autologous stem cells are already being tested in clinical trials for cardiac repair. Such therapies could save lives and reduce the cost of treating heart failure as compared to conventional transplantation. In addition, autologous adult stem cells avoid ethical issues associated with other stem cell sources. 3. IMMUNE SYSTEM ENHANCEMENT BY ENGINEERED IMMUNE CELLS AND NOVEL VACCINATION STRATEGIES FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE Infectious diseases represent the largest disease burden in the developing world. Engineered immune cells and novel vaccination strategies could improve an individual's ability to fight infections and could combat new strains of common diseases. Major focus should be given to developing inexpensive technologies that are easy to disseminate. 4. TISSUE ENGINEERED SKIN SUBSTITUTES, AUTOLOGOUS STEM OR PROGENITOR CELLS, INTELLIGENT DRESSINGS, AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES FOR SKIN LOSS DUE TO BURNS, WOUNDS, AND DIABETIC ULCERS Regenerative medicine for skin repair and regeneration is applicable to such major problems in developing countries as burns, diabetic ulcers, non-healing wounds, and in the treatment of war victims. Skin stem cells and tissue engineered skin substitutes have already been used successfully in the clinic. Such applications reduce morbidity and mortality due to skin loss, improve the quality of life of patients, and reduce costs associated with long-term care and rehabilitation. 5. BIOCOMPATIBLE BLOOD SUBSTITUTES FOR TRANSFUSION REQUIREMENTS Blood products are in high demand in developing countries, especially for post-traumatic transfusion requirements, yet donor blood is a major source of transmission for infectious diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis B. Biocompatible blood substitutes avoid the problem of contamination, overcome donor shortages, and mimic the natural properties of blood. Ideally, such blood substitutes would be able to be stored at room temperature, be non-toxic and non-antigenic, and be inexpensive to manufacture, transport, and administer. 6. UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD BANKING FOR FUTURE CELL REPLACEMENT THERAPIES AND OTHER APPLICATIONS Umbilical cord blood banking does not require complex technology and holds promise for the future treatment of a wide range of diseases. In addition to being currently available and safe, umbilical cord-derived stem cells can be viewed as more socially acceptable than other sources. Focus should be given to developing public banks that offer free services, as well as to improved training and supervision of umbilical cord blood banking in developing countries. 7. TISSUE ENGINEERED CARTILAGE, MODIFIED CHONDROCYTES, AND OTHER TISSUE ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGIES FOR TRAUMATIC AND DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE Due to malnutrition, trauma, and an aging population, joint diseases are common in developing countries. Current treatment methods are expensive, are not universally available, and can have major side effects. Regenerative treatments could help to relieve these problems by overcoming the poor natural healing of cartilaginous defects and, thus, increase the mobility and economic productivity of patients. 8. GENE THERAPY AND STEM CELL TRANSPLANTS FOR INHERITED BLOOD DISORDERS SUCH AS THALASSEMIAS, SICKLE CELL DISEASE, AND HEMOPHILIA Inherited blood disorders are a major drain on the health resources of developing countries due to the need for repeated transfusion requirements and hospital treatments. Gene therapy and stem cell 86 transplants are technically feasible, and could lead to improved survival and quality of life for patients, including a large number of children, in developing countries. 9. NERVE REGENERATION TECHNOLOGIES USING GROWTH FACTORS, STEM CELLS, AND SYNTHETIC NERVE GUIDES FOR SPINAL CORD AND PERIPHERAL NERVE INJURIES Nerve regeneration technologies are technically feasible and could offer better rehabilitation and reduced disability costs following severe trauma. Nerve injury and death due to accidents, trauma, violence, and infectious disease are a major source of morbidity in developing countries and pose a large burden on health care resources. 10. HEPATOCYTE TRANSPLANTS AS REPLACMENT THERAPY FOR CHRONIC LIVER DISEASES OR LIVER FAILURE Due to widespread Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C, liver diseases and failure are common in developing countries. Hepatocyte transplants could offer a simpler and less expensive alternative to current treatment options, overcome the shortage of donor organs, and could provide solutions that avoid immunologic rejection. 11. GENETICALLY MODIFIED STEM AND OTHER CELLS FOR IMMUNE SYSTEM REPAIR IN IMMUNODEFICIENCIES Simple and affordable methods of reconstituting the immune system in patients with immunodeficiencies could help to reduce the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS as well as to aid children with immunodeficiency secondary to malnutrition. Pharmaceutical methods of managing immunodeficiencies are unaffordable to many in developing countries, and immune repair treatments are not currently available. Genetically modified cells could rebuild the immune system, help return patients to the workforce, and guard against re-infection. 12. METHODS TO INDUCE AND CONTROL STEM CELL HOMING AFTER SIMPLE INTRAVENOUS DELIVERY Intravenous methods would allow for the simple, efficient, and inexpensive delivery of stem cell therapies for a wide variety of conditions. The homing and anchoring of cells are currently major challenges facing cell therapies. 13. MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR APPROACHES, EITHER USED DIRECTLY OR THROUGH STIMULATING IMMUNE RESPONSE, FOR MALIGNANCIES Molecular and cellular approaches, such as cell-based vaccines, would help to reduce the enormous burden of treating cancer in developing countries. Such approaches are technically feasible, with some already reaching clinical trials. 14. STEM AND PROGENITOR CELLS, WITH OR WITHOUT GENETIC MODIFICATION, FOR CORNEAL AND RETINAL DISEASES AND INJURIES Blindness, caused by malnutrition, trauma, and increasingly, diabetes, is much more prevalent in the developing world than in industrialized nations. Often the livelihood of a young and economically critical patient group is negatively affected due to a lack of infrastructure to assist such individuals. The use of stem and progenitor cells for the repair of retinal and corneal diseases is already underway in the developing world and is yielding promising results.
