One Navajo medicine-man, Mr. Andy Natonobah, has described a ceremony that has been passed down for generations in his family of traditional healers for curing Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome. This ceremony entails the use of several herbal medicines that have known inotrophic properties in very high dosages. The herbal medicines are titrated in response to the patients respiratory status for up to four days with the goal of delivering the maximum amount of medicines without achieving drug toxicity until the patient recovers. This mirrors the function of a modern intensive care unit in that respect. The Navajo however, use this curing ceremony to integrate their holistic view of uniting the patient with the universe in achieving this cure.
