Formaldehyde, aluminum salts, and mercury are just a few of the scary ingredients. If you are forced to get the flu shot or if you choose to get the flu shot (no judgment) there are some things that will help your body deal with the toxic ingredients that are injected. Vitamin C, before and after Vitamin C is necessary for a healthy immune system. We typically don't get enough in our diet and sugar will compete for vitamin C receptor sites so supplement with 3000 mg of vitamin C per day. In higher dosages, It can cause loose stools so take to your tolerance. [I recommend this one that also has bioflavonoids that helps decrease inflammation and improve immunity. ](https://specificwellness.metagenics.com/500-c-methoxyflavone) Choose Thimerosal-Free Thimerosal is mercury. Mercury is a neurotoxin which means it kills off nerve cells. Your brain is made of nerve cells and if you are anything like me you can't afford to lose them. Mercury is used in stabilizing the virus in vaccinations. Make sure you choose a thimerosal-free flu shot. Thimerosal-free flu shots can usually be found at the county health department. Avoid Aspirin, Tylenol\u00ae and Ibuprofen [Studies have shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2693360/) that using aspirin, Tylenol\u00ae and ibuprofen can decrease the bodies ability to produce the immune cells, called antibodies, needed to protect you. Since the whole reason to get the flu vaccine is to stimulate the immune system you want to be sure they are active and plentiful. If you are achy after the flu shot you can take natural anti-inflammatory compounds. Turmeric, ginger, and omega 3 oils decrease inflammation in the body. Magnesium glycinate is a natural muscle relaxant and is depleted with stress and toxin exposure. 300-400 mg once or twice a day can help with the achiness. Watch for loose stools, it's the only side effect that may occur in higher doses. Detox! Take activated charcoal capsules to absorb toxins. Make sure to take it away from other medications and food. Take a clay bath using bentonite clay. It draws out toxins. 30 minutes in a sauna will get you sweating out toxins. Be sure to hydrate. Do our 10 or 28-day detox program. It can help your body recover from the toxins, even if you can't avoid the thimerosal because our medical food has ingredients to help metabolize heavy metals like mercury. [Take our detox quiz.](https://www.specificwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MET1229DetoxQuestionnaire.pdf) If you score moderate to high, I recommend the 28-day detox. If you score low and have had a flu shot I recommend the 10-day detox. Raise your glutathione Glutathione is your body's number one antioxidant. It is protective and can help remove toxins and metals found in the flu shot. Taking N-acetyl cysteine can boost glutathione. Selenium is a mineral that is also needed to support glutathione. Eating 3-5 selenium-rich brazil nuts daily can give you the amount you need. Massage Massage moves out toxins through the lymphatic system. Chiropractic Come in for spinal adjustments to keep your immune system healthy and strong. The nerve supply needs to get to your kidneys and liver adequately in order for you to detox properly. We have payment plans for both massage and chiropractic that reduces the cost of visits and can be used with other established patients like friends and family. Here's to a healthy immune system!
