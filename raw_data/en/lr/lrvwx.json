Cleanses are a great way to reduce the stress on your mind, body, and spirit. The great yoga guru Paramhansa Yogananda said cleansing is \"a method for rejuvenating the body cells and awakening the latent powers of the mind and inner forces of the soul.\" As I am getting ready to lead a cleanse this weekend, many people want to choose to participate if the diet interests them. I would like to encourage people that there is much more to cleansing than diet. Intention is Key I think many of us have heard of the power of intention and how that sets the stage to clearly direct the performance of our lives. I often have an interesting phenomena with cleanses. Typically the body does not fully detox until day 4 or 5 on a cleanse. Once I started setting intentions, I could feel the symptoms of detoxing before the cleanse even began! Sometimes we forget how powerful our minds are! \"Cleanse your busy-ness\" In my previous blog, Nine Days to a New You, I compared the body to the streets of New York. When we always eat three meals or more a day, our system can get clogged. When we give it a break from running food through it, that's when we can get more fine tuned cleaning of 'our streets.' I love how after just one day of Paramhansa Yogananda's Nine-Day Diet my mind is so calm and relaxed that I can get deep into meditation right away. Imagine all the other things you can easily accomplish with a focused mind? We also clog and confuse our system by doing so many things, doing multiple things at once, and having multiple things going on at once around ourselves in this busy creative world. Imagine a factory manager trying to give multiple orders to each processing line. Everything and everyone would get confused. Have you ever felt how refreshing it is to take a walk in a park or sit on an empty beach? That is how the body feels when you simplify your diet for a few days. If we can heal our bodies by reducing the busy-ness of our food, why not make a cleanse simply be an experience where we reduce the amount of stimuli impacting ourselves for a short period of time? What if this weekend you spend an hour alone, or take a walk in a quiet park, or add just five minutes of meditation a day? Another idea is to eat one meal in silence while focusing on the spiritual eye. Take your time to chew. Your food will digest more easily and you will be able to notice all the wonderful tastes of your food. Maybe add some candles or a photo of a loved one to the table.
