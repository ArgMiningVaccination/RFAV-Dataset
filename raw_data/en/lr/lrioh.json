For patients who have never taken aripiprazole, establish tolerability with oral aripiprazole prior to initiating treatment with Abilify Asimtufii. Due to the half-life of oral aripiprazole, it may take up to 2 weeks to fully assess tolerability. Abilify Asimtufii must be administered as an intramuscular gluteal injection by a healthcare professional. Do not administer by any other route. Recommended Dosage For Abilify Asimtufii The recommended dosage of Abilify Asimtufii is 960 mg, administered once every 2 months (56 days after previous injection). Patients Receiving Oral Antipsychotics When Abilify Asimtufii injection is initiated in patients receiving oral aripiprazole, administer the first dose of Abilify Asimtufii along with oral aripiprazole (10 mg to 20 mg) for 14 consecutive days. For patients already stable on another oral antipsychotic (and known to tolerate aripiprazole), administer the first Abilify Asimtufii injection along with the oral antipsychotic for 14 consecutive days. Patients Receiving Abilify Maintena For patients receiving Abilify Maintena (once monthly dosing), administer Abilify Asimtufii 960 mg (once every 2 month dosing) in place of the next scheduled injection of the Abilify Maintena. The first Abilify Asimtufii injection may be administered in place of the second, or later injection of Abilify Maintena. If there are adverse reactions with the Abilify Asimtufii 960 mg dosage, the dosage may be reduced to 720 mg once every 2 months. Patients may be given the Abilify Asimtufii injection up to 2 weeks before or 2 weeks after the 2-month scheduled timepoint. Missed Doses If more than 8 weeks and less than 14 weeks have elapsed since the last injection, administer the next dose of Abilify Asimtufii as soon as possible. The once every 2 month schedule should be resumed. If more than 14 weeks have elapsed since the last injection, restart concomitant oral aripiprazole for 14 days with the next administered injection of Abilify Asimtufii. Dosage Recommendations For Cytochrome P450 Considerations Dosage adjustments for patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and/or in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP2D6 inhibitors for more than 14 days are described in Table 1.
