I was depressed, and I had severe anxiety. I was suicidal, I went to a Doctor @ kaiser, Who prescribed me Xanax and other depression medication. I did not feel I needed it. I got a second opinion that's when I found Dr. Janna Redding ,she ran my labs and found I was severely deficient in vitamin D....Oregon, Washington, & Alaska, have the highest rate of suicide and depression. Get your Blood checked !!! Thank you Dr. Redding & the staff @ Center for Natural Medicine - 5/28/2022 I have had nothing but superlative experiences at CNM. I've been seeing Dr. Stacie Wolfe, ND in a primary care function and she's *such* a find. CNM uses a system called Athena that makes communicating with staff and clinicians a BREEZE. Dr. Wolfe always responded promptly to my questions. She even owned the error when a particular blood test we'd decided I didn't need was done, and she invited me to send the bill to them and they indeed took care of it! I'm a medical biller and coder by trade and I work closely with a naturopath who I deeply respect, and we're a tiny facility. What I appreciate about CNM is their closeness to me geographically (I can walk!), they're a Portland icon, I trust their integrity. They made it super easy to get my Shingrix vaccinations as well. My review is from someone who works on the inside of a natural medicine clinic elsewhere in Portland, so I have an insider's perspective. They're using software that they love and that serves me as a patient VERY well. I am envious of their ease of communication. So grateful to be plugged into this facility! - 1/12/2023 Dr.Marissa is amazing. She is very nurturing in her approach to medicine. Not only is she a naturopath but she's an excellent herbalist and acupuncturist, I'd highly recommend her if you're looking for a Doctor who truly cares. - 9/11/2022 I had a really negative experience as an EDS patient in an appointment with Bob Graybill. Even though he advertises himself as EDS-competent, on my first appointment he questioned my diagnosis (which I had thorough documentation of) and made me run through some of the diagnostic criteria (a lot less thoroughly than the person who diagnosed me, who took measurements and made notes, he just asked me random questions from the list of criteria) including the Beighton scale (why would I, or any of the over a dozen providers who have made me go through it and documented the results, lie about my Beighton scale results?), and then told me my \"skin wasn't fragile enough\" for EDS, even though again I had already been diagnosed and there are many criteria for EDS that have nothing to do with skin fragility. He then said he would order some diagnostic tests for me after reviewing my medical history and follow up, but he never followed up with me and basically ghosted me. It's one of the most unprofessional experiences I've ever had with a medical provider, and I've had a LOT. If you have EDS, I highly suggest you look elsewhere; this doctor is unprofessional and highly dismissive of EDS patients. - 4/10/2021 Zero stars. Terribly disorganized, poor communication. ND Redding forgot our 7am phone appointment and I had to call in to request she call me. I was told rx called into my pharmacy, waited in line 30 min & it wasn't called in. I called the office and left two messages four days apart with no callback, only got a call back when I left one for a supervisor. No explanation or apology, no record of my rx. Several calls later, was told it was called in, only to find it had been sent to the wrong pharmacy. Waited 40 minutes in line to finally get it. So much of my time wasted and disrespected. Definitely switching NDs. - 3/15/2018 Even worse than the DR I was tying to replace. Dr Milner seemed great on the first visit. He went over a lot of details and ordered some blood work and records. However, when I returned two weeks later to have blood drawn he had no idea why I was there, no medical records from other Drs and no appointment to draw my blood. He then wanted me to come back and talk about eating herbs he sells and do an exercise program. Upon leaving I was asked who I was and why I was there. It really is Sad, I had such high hopes! - 10/25/2019Updated review There are providers here that are good, but their administrative system needs a lot more work, training, and better handoffs. Information handoffs are tough especially if that information isn't available to them on their system. If you are relatively healthy, without need for possible advanced care, it's fine. You can use folks here to help. If you need possibly more advanced care with physicians that have admitting privileges, you need to get this on track. Keep expectations low when it comes to admin stuff, then you're fine. Use them as an auxiliary. I've moved my care away due to necessity, but I do have a provider here I love that I will try to see here and there.6/19/2017Previous review There are a lot of issues with this clinic - the most frustrating of which are their documentation practices, communication practices, and generally how the clinic is run. 1) Front Desk Don't expect: a) anyone to know how to do anything b) anyone to know how any of the providers work c) know the policies to anything d) return any phone calls without at least 3 calls to them e) pass any messages onto the providers correctly. It's insane. I don't know why it's this bad. I really don't. I've worked in clinics and hospitals so I've seen a lot. It's really bad. 2) Billing There is one person who will return your phone call - 50% of the time and several weeks later. They get things wrong here. All the time. I don't know why. I'm actually waiting for a bill correction that I called them about 6 months ago that I paid over the phone, the billing person told me not to pay the bill that would come out later, this bill was rebilled to me, increased, and sent 3 more times. I had to call again and leave a message and I am still waiting for a call back 2 weeks later. I don't know it's this bad. I really don't. (Also, I've been billed for things 2 years later - really.) 3) Providers The providers think things happen a certain way. The rest of the clinic does not. You will be charged for visits the providers - via the front desk - cancelled, then have to talk to the provider and say, hey. You guys cancelled this appointment, not me. I was not called about this until the day before our scheduled visit. Expensive products that are prescribed and they have to order out for, the provider will tell you that the clinic should receive the product in a week. You ask if you should call to which their response will be that no, don't call in. The clinic will call you. You wait 2 weeks, nothing happens. You call the clinic (twice), they tell you they don't know anything about the shipment, but that they will check in with the doctor and the doctor will get back to you. No communication. Nothing happens for 6 more weeks. You decide to make an appointment. The provider blames you for not coming in sooner to pick the product up. You tell the provider, the clinic never called me. I called the clinic twice and they said you would call me and to not call because you guys would reach out to me. This \"visit\" lasts 10 minutes where all you do is pick up the order you were expecting 2.5 months ago, tell the provider that their front desk needs help, then you are billed over $200 for it. No joke. Depending on the provider, they will insist on office visits that you can't get in to see the because they only work 2 days a week for things you've seen them before and what you need is a Rx refill. I once suspected I was getting an infection based on experience and how I was feeling. I preemptively went to see them right before a business trip in another state and asked for a Rx for antibiotics I could fill in case I became worse - we had already ruled out a viral infxn. It was a hard no. Well, I got a lot worse and then had to spend a half of a day during my business conference to deal with getting a Rx sent to a different state where NDs aren't licensed. 4) Their electronic medical record. They implemented this a couple years ago. Providers don't know how to look up results even though you tell them, 'I already had that scan and had your front desk staff scan those results into my chart'. Thus, the providers aren't prepared for your visit - even if it's the 5th time you're seeing them; they don't remember - they shouldn't remember, providers prep for your visit by looking into your chart - if they can't find the info, then they aren't going to be prepared for the visit. The front desk and billing folks don't know how to use the electronic medical record to review telephone calls, past visits, etc. 5) Patient Fusion, the program where you can review your office visit notes and message your provider directly. You can only review the office visit notes or lab results that the provider checked off for you to review. If they forget, let's be real, I have to call every single time after an office visit to see if they will release them so I can have copies of my medical records, you can't see them. Providers don't check patient messages. Some never check them. Some, you may receive a message for 3 months later, depending on the provider. Although I prefer naturopathic care, I've already decided to start moving my care somewhere else. They're not organized, not experienced enough, and I prefer my medical records to be centralized somehow where people talk to each other. I also prefer that my billing is correct the first time rather than continuously get bills in the mail for things I already paid them for or that they decide to bill me for 2 years later. I wish I would have never come here to begin with because having to untangle things I get here - frankly, there are things I won't be able to move somewhere else. - 7/31/2020 I went here for acupuncture and I have to say that my experience was less then positive. Should have read the reviews before going here. First of all, I was approved for 10 Acupuncture appointments and nobody told me that I had been approved until I called. Weeks have gone by with me being approved and heard nothing. The clinic is clean so 5 stars for that. Next, I had my appointment with Fumi. I have to say I would not go back to here. I felt very judged for being a vegetarian for I could tell she strongly believes in eating meat. She talked way to much and I only received 5 min of acupuncture which was a total waste of my time. She was also swearing a lot like saying the F word which I thought was very unprofessional. I felt like she only cared about getting my money and didn't care for me as a person. Would not recommend this place. Go somewhere else. - 5/17/2016 First time I walked into this place I was actually looking for a different office around the block. The receptionists were okay in helping me find the right place. I remember feeling happy that my appointment wasn't there. Fast forward a couple years later; I've been searching for a new ND and want to make sure I find the right person. It turns out that a Dr.'s staff are just important as the Dr. Center For Natural Medicine wouldn't make an appointment with me until they confirmed my insurance (P.S. I only called because you were listed as a provider under my insurance plan) Three days later I got the call that they do take my insurance and could help me schedule an appointment. Since I only asked for an initial consultation they opted to have me speak with the ND over the phone for 10min. I went ahead and made the phone appt for the next day. In the mean time I was able to call and connect with a different office who was able to schedule an appointment for me in the same week and also confirm my insurance with me over the phone. I was so pleased with this other office that I didn't even take the time to speak with this Center's ND. I feel bad because she looked nice enough on the website but her office lost her this new patient. Their office should try upgrading their customer service practices to 2016. - 6/24/2020 I've been a patient of Dr Wolfe's for 2 years and have received the very best care at the Center For Natural Medicine. The staff is friendly, polite and all very caring. Good healthcare is difficult to come by these days but you can tell that they really care about their patients and have a welcoming healing atmosphere Other Chiropractors Nearby [read more](/adredir?ad_business_id=GBn8M09NEGUBov0wHw0R_g&campaign_id=793nyaRlJeU6wm82-OvfnA&click_origin=read_more&placement=below_biz_review&placement_slot=1&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fvitalize-chiropractic-salmon-creek-vancouver-2%23atb_alias%3AAboutThisBizSpecialties&request_id=63d67ad23d237089&signature=e97e8989073811549dafecf724db075b5d3e3ad2523e94313942915ea0e58505&slot=0) in Chiropractors [read more](/adredir?ad_business_id=9Xfq7VHn6dh0ssroLTBR8w&campaign_id=ew44MqrBe4-XIwJtOubC3g&click_origin=read_more&placement=below_biz_review&placement_slot=1&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fthe-wellness-center-pdx-portland-2%3Fhrid%3Dw8qn22xqys_Hyy9rC5-SOw&request_id=63d67ad23d237089&signature=d80302025300b30715fb1d15ab0a114eaa9373dab824b277564bd3bc9ff94cab&slot=1) in Chiropractors, Acupuncture, Massage Therapy "}
