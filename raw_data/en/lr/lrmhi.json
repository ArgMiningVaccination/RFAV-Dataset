In Jessica Raistrick's upcoming book The Gut Check - How to Reconnect With Your Intuition, she invites you to harness the power of your intuition. Located in Watertown, Connecticut, the Center for Natural Medicine is a full service, Connecticut-licensed Naturopathic clinic providing a holistic approach to wellness. As a family-run, individually owned and operated center for health, our team consists of skillful, top-rated practitioners who, as a couple, are able to provide a nuanced, attentive level of care. [Jonathan Raistrick, ND, MSTCM](/jonathan-raistrick) and [Jessica Raistrick, LCSW](/jessica-raistrick-lcsw), formerly Jessica Adams, offer a tailored approach utilizing their skill sets to ensure a well-rounded protocol for long-term healing. Treatment plans are uniquely prescribed based on the needs of each patient and incorporating multiple areas of expertise for optimum health and well-being. Our mission, as a natural healthcare organization, is to foster wellness in each and every person. We work closely with our patients to eliminate the underlying factors in the disease process to restore balance and optimal health\u2014today and for years to come. As a result, our integrated approach incorporates nutritional counseling, Traditional Chinese Medicine, licensed psychotherapy, certified Master-Level Reiki, and other healing modalities. The Center for Natural Medicine addresses all levels of a client's needs. With modern-day stressors, and now a year into the COVID pandemic, we find that our clients are experiencing the common responses of anxiety and overwhelm in the face of what we're going through today. To support our community we apply a distinctive approach to the process of moving through our feelings\u2014physically, energetically, and emotionally. In the past, one may participate in psychotherapy and right after a session, jump in their car and get right on that next email or respond to a text, without the space to truly integrate the healing happening in session. But when we allow ourselves the room to absorb and process what's experienced in therapy, through the calming, soothing practices of Reiki or Acupuncture, the healing is deepened. This highly integrative approach differentiates our practice significantly from others. We treat the whole person. How can we help you? What conditions do we treat? What is the process for professional support? What is Reiki? Want to learn more about our approach? Read our FAQ for answers to common questions, information about our services and our providers, insurance coverage and more. Naturopathy is guided by six foundational principles: Our Doctors offer holistic comprehensive and preventive care that focuses on natural methods to restore and maintain optimal health by supporting the patient's inherent self-healing process. Our Doctors practice Traditional Chinese Medicine, which is designed to help patients achieve and maintain health using the four pillars of acupuncture, movement (taiji, qigong), nutrition, and Chinese herbs. As a licensed clinician for more than 20 years, Jessica Raistrick, LCSW, shares that her therapeutic inspiration comes from the adolescents and adults that she treats who overcome the struggles of addiction, eating disorders, and family conflict. Jessica's expertise in holistic care enriches her clinical practice. Jessica is a certified Reiki Master. Reiki influences the subtle energy fields around the body to inspire positive transformation. In addition, the practice of Reiki can create a healing space for the integration of other modalities, especially talk therapy, trauma processing, holistic health integration, and overall wellness.
