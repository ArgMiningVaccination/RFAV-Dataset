Frenck, MD Dr. Frenck, along with Dr. David Bernstein, successfully re\u00adcompeted the Vaccine and Treatment Evaluations Unit (VTEU) contract which will continue through 2024 at an estimated value of $951 million. Dr. Frenck completed an National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded phase I study to evaluate a vaccine against Shigella sonnei. Immunogenicity testing is underway to determine the dose and vaccine to proceed into a challenge study. Dr. Frenck has been awarded an NIH\u00adfunded contract to conduct a study to determine the dose response curve of infection with norovirus. The project will enroll the first cohort by the end of the calendar year. Dr. Frenck has been awarded a DoD\u00adsponsored grant to develop a challenge model of Shigella sonnei. The model is a first step in a program to test vaccines to prevent S. sonnei infections, a major cause of shigellosis in industrialized nations. Dr. Frenck continues to maintain a research focus on clinical trials with special interest in enteric diseases. David I. Bernstein, MD, MA This year saw the conclusion of three important clinical trials led by Dr. Bernstein. Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common congenital virus infection around the world. A glycoprotein B subunit CMV vaccine with the adjuvant MF 59 was evaluated in healthy adolescent girls, a possible target for eventual immunization. Over 400 girls were enrolled, vaccinated and followed for 2 years at five sites across the USA. The vaccine was safe, highly immunogenic and showed a trend towards protection from CMV infection. In another multicenter efficacy trial, healthy men and women were vaccinated with a bivalent norovirus vaccine composed of two virus like particles (VLP) and then challenged with our GII.4 strain of norovirus. Norovirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis and the GII.4 genotype is the most common genotype. The vaccine was shown to be safe and immunogenic and decreased the severity of vomiting and diarrhea. Therefore the vaccine will progress to field efficacy studies. This is the first successful bivalent norovirus vaccine and the best evidence that a systemic vaccine can protect against norovirus Lastly, because strategies for post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in case of an anthrax bioterror event are needed, we evaluated four dosing schedules of an anthrax vaccine that could reduce antigen need. The schedules that included a dose at day 14 induced antibody earlier but the peak titers and duration were less than other schedules. Reducing the amount of antigen per dose of vaccine was less effective than full dose regimens. Dr. Bernstein participated in a clinical trial of a herpes simplex type 2 (HSV\u00ad2) vaccine. This vaccine, originally shown by our group to reduce recurrences and recurrent virus shedding in animal models, was also able to reduce clinical recurrences and recurrent asymptomatic shedding in patients with recurrent genital herpes. This is the first time a vaccine was shown to reduce recurrent HSV\u00ad2 shedding, the most common source for the spread of this virus. Work also continued on our pre\u00adclinical evaluation of other vaccines and therapeutics for both HSV\u00ad2 and CMV in animal models developed by us. Rebecca C. Brady, MD Dr. Brady was the Cincinnati Children's lead investigator for a National Institutes of Health (NIH), Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) sponsored clinical trial that assessed the immunogenicity of the 13\u00advalent pneumococcal vaccine in elderly adults that was completed in 2014. Dr. Brady also served as co\u00adinvestigator for many clinical studies performed at the Gamble Program for Clinical Studies, Cincinnati Children's Division of Infectious Diseases. She continues as the medical director of the Ohio American Academy of Pediatrics' Maximizing Office Based Immunization Program. Thisprogram has been expanded to include specialized modules and quality improvement activities. She continues as the contributing section editor for Infectious Diseases, an American Academy of Pediatrics Grand Rounds publication. She is leading the Division of Infectious Diseases in a quality improvement project to improve review of immunization records for all new patients seen in the infectious diseases clinics. This project will provide American Board of Pediatrics Maintenance of Certification Part IV credit. Together with Jennifer Huggins in the Division of Rheumatology, she received grant funding from Pfizer for the project Connecting the Silos: A Partnership to Improve Immunization Rates among Adolescents with High\u00adRisk Chronic and Immunocompromising Conditions. Rhonda D. Cardin, PhD The Cardin Lab, led by Rhonda Cardin focuses on cytomegalovirus (CMV) latency and pathogenesis of CMV infection. The lab previously showed that the viral chemokine receptor M33 encoded by murine CMV (MCMV) is required for long term latent infection. With collaborators, Dr. Helen Farrell in Australia, and Dr. Marie\u00adDominique Filippi at Cincinnati Children's, the Cardin Lab recently identified several cell populations in the bone marrow and spleen of latently\u00adinfected mice which harbor latent virus. Current efforts are aimed at characterizing M33 mutant viruses in these cell types to determine the function of M33 during CMV latency. Research has also shown that the human CMV (HCMV) chemokine receptors, US28 and UL33, function similar to M33, which is very exciting since mechanisms important for HCMV latent infection in humans may be identified. In collaboration with Dr. David Bernstein, the division, and as part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) antiviral program, is currently evaluating whether several novel vaccines protect against transmission of virus across the placenta during pregnancy in the GPCMV congenital model. If effective, a similar vaccine strategy in humans to protect the developing fetus and long term deleterious consequences of congenital HCMV infection such as mental deficits and hearing loss can be developed. Part of the antiviral program is characterizing several promising new anti\u00adCMV drugs in the MCMV model since there is a continued need for less toxic anti\u00adCMV drugs. Lastly, current evaluations of several promising vaccines against HSV\u00ad2 in the guinea pig model of genital herpes (both through NIH and industry contract studies). These studies provide preclinical evaluation that could lead to testing in human clinical trials. Beverly L. Connelly, MD The collaborative efforts of the infection control program, directed by Dr. Connelly, aligned with the institutional strategic goals to reduce healthcare associated infections (HAIs). Hand hygiene activities focused on family engagement and moved the program to very close to our institutional goal of 95% compliance. Changes to the 2015 CDC's National Health Safety Network definitions for HAIs created challenges for staff. With these definition changes came increased reporting in central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). The program partnered with clinical care improvement groups to identify opportunities for simplification of protocols and standardization of care. The complexity of patient care, especially in oncology and bone marrow transplant patient populations, make these areas a focus for CLABSI prevention learning in FY2016. With successful implementation of the catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) prevention bundle, the HAI approached zero. Collaborative efforts to reduce surgical site infections (SSIs) gained traction in FY15 with standardization of processes in cardiothoracic surgery, orthopaedic spine surgery, and in neurosurgery and reduced numbers of deep infections in each. Spread of standard processes in FY16 across all surgical arenas is expected to have a favorable impact on SSIs. The infection control program was a partner in the development of Cincinnati Children's policies, practices and protocols to identify and safely manage a patient who might present with ebola virus disease. These activities capitalized on collaborative relationships already in existence and fostered new ones to enable the institution to meet previously unanticipated challenges. Because of staff experiences with fungal HAIs in the context of unprecedented construction and renovation activities in FY14, the infection control program developed enhanced surveillance activities in this area. Collaborative relationships with Plant Engineering and Construction services have resulted in state\u00adof\u00adthe\u00adart prevention programs with our construction contractors.Lara Danziger\u00adIsakov, MD, MPH Dr. Lara Danziger\u00adIsakov continues her role as protocol chair for two studies in the Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation in Children (CTOT\u00adC) funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). One study evaluates the interaction between respiratory viral infections and the development of allo - and autoimmunity after pediatric lung transplantation. The second study assesses perceived barriers to adherence after pediatric solid organ transplantation. She was recently re\u00adappointed to the Steering Committee to CTOTC and was named as co\u00adchair of the Adherence, Growth & Development and QOL Subcommittee. Further, Dr. Danziger\u00adIsakov will be the protocol chair for a new study under development to assess the impact of B\u00adcell induction on the development of allo\u00ad and autoimmunity and early graft dysfunction that was recently funded. Dr. Danziger\u00adIsakov has expanded her work in solid organ transplantation (SOT) in collaboration with the Studies in Pediatric Liver Transplantation (SPLIT) to evaluate current practices for cytomegalovirus prevention. A focus on quality improvement has led to the development of evidence\u00adbased guidelines for the prevention of cytomegalovirus at Cincinnati Children's and to significant improvements in pre\u00adtransplant infectious disease risk assessment. Michelle P. Dickey, MS, CRN Ms. Dickey's interest is in the area of clinical vaccine trials in infants, children, adolescents, adults, elderly, pregnant and breastfeeding populations. Additional interests in clinical research include the areas of informed consent and quality management. With collaborators, Ms. Dickey has undertaken an innovative approach to simplified informed consent and assent. David B. Haslam, MD Dr. Haslam joined the Division of Infectious Diseases in the summer of 2013 as the medical director of the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program. Along with Josh Courter, PharmD, the stewardship program has implemented VigiLanz Clinical Decision Support software which performs real\u00adtime monitoring of antimicrobial use and resistance, facilitating audit and feedback of antimicrobial use at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Dr. Haslam's research laboratory is investigating the mechanisms of defense against Clostridium difficile infection. In particular, the laboratory is investigating how normal intestinal bacteria (the 'microbiome') prevent C. difficile disease. Additionally, the laboratory is performing whole genome sequencing to investigate relatedness and potential transmission of bacterial strains isolated from distinct patient populations. Margaret K. Hostetter, MD Research in the Hostetter Laboratory, led by Margaret Hostetter, has expanded into three main areas. 1) Heparin binding motifs in Candida albicans and their role in biofilm. After publishing a paper on the effects of an antibody against heparin binding motifs in inhibiting Candida albicans biofilm production (Journal of Infectious Diseases, 2013 208:1695\u00ad1704), the laboratory is now testing the efficacy of the antibody to inhibit biofilms formed by other organisms. 2) Role of candidal vaginal colonization in preterm birth. The laboratory has shown that colonization with Candida albicans skews the cytokines response of vaginal epithelial cells by augmenting the release of pro\u00adinflammatory cytokines that are damaging to pregnancy and by inhibiting the release of cytokines that preserve pregnancy. The in vitro data have sparked a clinical study of pregnant women in Bangladesh, also funded by the Global Alliance to Prevent Prematurity and Stillbirth (GAPPS), an arm of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. 3) Genetics of disseminated staphylococcal infection after osteomyelitis. Exome sequencing of parent/child trios identified de novo mutations implicating two novel pathways for susceptibility to disseminated staphylococcal disease. In vitro experiments to identify the functional correlates of these mutations are underway. Nancy M. Hutchinson, RN, MSN, CIC Ms. Hutchinson's interests are in the area of prevention of healthcare\u00adacquired infections with an emphasis on device\u00adassociated infections. Ms. Hutchinson is an active participant in a national collaborative on strategies for prevention of central line\u00adassociated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology/oncology patients and bone marrow transplant recipients. In addition, she has presented regionally and nationally on infection prevention and control practices. Jason Jiang, PhD Dr. Jiang's laboratory continued working on norovirus (NV) and rotavirus (RV) research, mainly focusing on the virus\u00adhost interaction related to human histo\u00adblood group antigen (HBGAs) as receptors. The lab found that, in addition to HBGAs, NVs may recognize another carbohydrate ligand, the sialic acid related glycans, as potential receptors or co\u00adreceptors. This finding pointed to a new research direction on NVs for a potential solution to develop a cell culture system for NVs. They propose to further validate this finding using the Tulane virus as a model and search for permissive cell lines with potential double positive phenotypes of HBGA and sialic acids in attempt to cultivate NVs in vitro. For rotavirus, they have expanded their understanding on the diversity of RVs recognizing different HBGAs by variable in vitro binding/blocking, hemagglutination and cell culture based assays. They also generated a large amount of information on potential host ligands for a number of animal RVs by collaboration with glycobiology experts in the US and the UK. Further study to elucidate the precise carbohydrate structures recognized by these animal RVs is planned which may lead to important understanding on the host range, evolution and zoonotic of RVs which will impact the understanding of the epidemiology and vaccine development against RVs. In addition, they are actively involved in development and evaluation of vaccines against NVs and RVs. Monica M. McNeal, MS Ms. McNeal is the associate director for the Laboratory for Specialized Clinical Studies (LSCS), in the Division of Infectious Diseases, which provides lab support for clinical studies involving vaccine trials and vaccine development and surveillance studies. The lab has been, and continues to be, the central lab supporting the development of all past and present live oral rotavirus vaccines. Rotavirus vaccines continue to be an important aspect in improving child health worldwide. Ms. McNeal has continued to support rotavirus vaccine trials conducted in numerous countries around the world in association with nonprofit organizations and industrial sponsors. Some of those studies involve determining how to improve efficacy of rotavirus vaccines in developing countries in Asia and Africa. One of the important outcomes from several of these studies it that breast feeding does not interfere with live oral rotavirus vaccines. This has important implications for countries that rely heavily on breast feeding. The lab continues to support the development of non\u00adliving rotavirus vaccines by developing and validating assays for clinical trials. The first ever human vaccine trial using a non\u00ad living rotavirus vaccine in children and infants is being conducted in Africa, and the LSCS is analyzing all samples from this trial. She is also directly involved in supporting and establishing clinical labs in India and China to support rotavirus vaccine trials in those countries. The lab is also involved in supporting influenza vaccines, analyzing samples from clinical trials conducted in the US and Nepal in pregnant women. Additional projects include using animal models to investigate the effects of malnutrition on oral rotavirus vaccines, detecting the pathogens causing community acquired pneumonia presenting to the ED, rotavirus vaccine effectiveness in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and establishing assays to quantitate norovirus shedding in immunocompromised patients. Ms. McNeal continues to support the clinical trials run by the Gamble Program by establishing new assays and providing laboratory support. Grant C. Paulsen, MD Dr. Paulsen joined the Division of Infectious Diseases in the summer of 2014 with a focus in transplant infectious diseases. Dr. Paulsen maintains a research focus on clinical research with special interest in prevention of post\u00adtransplant infections, vaccination following organ transplant and treatment and prevention of viral infections in immunocompromised patients. Research in pre\u00adtransplant methicillin\u00adresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screening is aimed at determining the effect of screening and use of targeted peri\u00adoperative prophylactic antibiotics on early post\u00adtransplant infections. He is alsoinvestigating the safety and efficacy of live viral vaccines, such as varicella and MMR, following liver transplantation with a proposed collaboration with the Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEU). Dr. Paulsen also serves as sub\u00ad investigator for a number of ongoing clinical studies in immunocompromised patients. Joseph E. Qualls, PhD Research in the Qualls Laboratory, led by Joseph Qualls, has focused on the contribution of intracellular L\u00adarginine synthesis on immune cell function. L\u00adarginine is a semi\u00adessential amino acid, meaning it cannot be synthesized to sufficient amounts in our bodies during \"stressful\" conditions - including infection and other disease states. In addition to serving as a building block for protein synthesis, this amino acid is required for microbicidal NO production by macrophages and for T lymphocyte proliferation. When L\u00adarginine is limiting, these cells rely on L\u00adarginine synthesis from L\u00adcitrulline, to sustain their respective functions. Mice that cannot convert L\u00adcitrulline to L\u00adarginine in immune cells of hematopoietic lineage are impaired at clearing M. bovis BCG and M. tuberculosis infection in vivo. 1) One project funded by the American Heart Association aims to define the metabolic consequences of L\u00adcitrulline in mycobacteria\u00adinfected macrophages. Preliminary data suggest harnessing the L\u00adarginine synthesis pathway, by supplementing L\u00adcitrulline in vitro and in vivo, is protective against mycobacterial infection, and experiments defining the mechanism of this protection are underway. 2) A doctoral candidate in the laboratory, Shannon Rapovy, is studying the necessity of L\u00adcitrulline metabolism during T cell function. Although previous studies have shown that L\u00adcitrulline can rescue T cell proliferation in L\u00adarginine scarce environments in vitro, the contribution of L\u00adcitrulline on T cell function in vivo has not been addressed. Shannon has recently established a novel mouse model to probe the necessity and mechanism of L\u00adcitrulline metabolism in T cells, and experiments testing this during homeostasis and disease in vivo are underway. This project is partially funded by the American Association of Immunologists, which is supporting Ms. Rapovy's stipend for 2015\u00ad2016. Nancy M. Sawtell, PhD Most of the human population world\u00adwide has been infected by herpes simplex viruses (HSVs). Following the initial lytic infection, HSVs establish permanent latent infections within neurons in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Reactivation of latent virus not only results in viral disease (new infections, blindness and encephalitis) but also contributes to HIV infection, diabetes, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. No effective vaccine is available, and no therapy eliminates latency or prevents reactivation. The long\u00adterm goal of ongoing research in the Sawtell Lab is to find interventions for recurrent HSV episodes by defining mechanisms that control establishment and reactivation of HSV\u00ad1 latency. The gene expression cascade during HSV\u00ad1 lytic infection begins with activation of immediate\u00adearly (IE) gene transcription by the virion protein VP16 with host factors Oct\u00ad1 and HCF\u00ad1. In contrast, the initial events in the reactivation from latency are still poorly defined. Their central hypothesis is that a specialized region of the VP16 promoter regulates its de novo expression in neurons and thereby controls the establishment of, and reactivation from latency. A second layer of stress responsive regulation entails post translational structural modification of the VP16 proteins, which influences its interaction with its binding partners HCF\u00ad1 and Oct\u00ad1. Their studies will have a major impact on vaccine and gene transfer vector design, and may lead to a new class of therapeutics. Through the use of a mouse genetic reference population they have identified a locus on mouse chromosome 16 that regulates HSV neurovirulence as well as the severity of herpetic stromal keratitis. Their studies are the first to demonstrate that the virus' interaction with the nervous system contributes to its ability to cause corneal opacity and blindness and have led to a novel hypothesis regarding the initiation of stromal disease. In related studies they have initiated a \"genomics squared\" analysis to explore the interaction of both viral and host genetics in herpetic disease. In a project funded by NASA, the Sawtell Lab is conducting studies to determine the long term outcomes of latent HSV in the central nervous system and the effects of stress and exposure to galactic cosmic radiation on HSV related pathology in the brain. These studies will not only define risks to astronauts and but also model HSV induced CNS damage (potentially increasing dementia risks) occurring in the aging population. Finally, a new National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded project exploits virally encoded miRNAs to regulate HSV reactivation in vivo.Elizabeth P. Schlaudecker, MD, MPH Dr. Schlaudecker's research continues to focus on the immunologic responses to maternal immunization. After completing a comprehensive epidemiologic study of the etiology and seasonality of viral respiratory infections in rural Honduras, she has shifted to prevention of these infections with maternal immunization. Her recent work has demonstrated antibody persistence in mothers one year after pneumococcal immunization in pregnancy, as well as a significantly decreased antibody response to influenza immunization in pregnant women. In collaboration with Dr. Mark Steinhoff and Monica McNeal, she evaluated influenza\u00adspecific IgA levels in breast milk and demonstrated that they were significantly higher in influenza vaccinees compared to pneumococcal controls for at least six months postpartum. She also demonstrated that greater exclusivity of breastfeeding in the first 6 months of life significantly decreased the expected number of respiratory illness with fever episodes in infants of influenza\u00advaccinated mothers, but not in infants of pneumococcal\u00advaccinated mothers. Dr. Schlaudecker continues to study the immunologic response to influenza immunization in pregnant women with the support of a K12 Child Health Research Career Development Award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). She investigated the IgG isotype responses to influenza immunization in Dr. Sing Sing Way's laboratory with the mentorship of Dr. Fred Finkelman in the Division Immunobiology and demonstrated an altered isotype profile in pregnant women compared to non\u00adpregnant women consistent with a decreased response to the vaccine. She is also investigating a novel respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine administered to pregnant women to prevent RSV in their infants, as well as immunologic responses to immunization in breast milk with Cincinnati Children's Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit (VTEU). Samir S. Shah, MD, MSCE Dr. Shah's research team focuses on improving efficiency and effectiveness of care of hospitalized children with a particular emphasis on respiratory tract infections. Several ongoing studies will determine the comparative effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens for community\u00adacquired pneumonia and identify biomarkers that predict illness severity in children with community\u00adacquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Dr. Shah is also PI on a parallel group randomized trial determining the efficacy of home nursing visits in improving outcomes after hospitalization for acute illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Mary A. Staat, MD, MPH Through Dr. Staat's large epidemiology and surveillance program developed in 1997, she has been able to develop optimal methods of detecting the changes and manifestations of infectious diseases of children within Cincinnati Children's and for the population of Hamilton County, and to compare these findings to national trends. Recognizing that Cincinnati Children's captures essentially all Hamilton County children requiring hospitalization or care in the emergency department has allowed Dr. Staat to conduct studies to determine the population\u00adbased rates of Hamilton County hospitalizations and emergency department visits for many pediatric infectious diseases using unique methods such as capture\u00adrecapture methods to determine disease burden and case\u00adcohort and case\u00adcontrol designs to determine the post\u00adlicensure effectiveness of rotavirus and influenza vaccines. Studies published include the effectiveness of rotavirus and influenza vaccines, pre\u00ad and post\u00adlicensure costs of rotavirus disease, epidemiology of rotavirus, norovirus and other enteric infections as well as the epidemiology and disease burden of respiratory viruses. Dr. Staat has also utilized data from her large international adoption center to publish studies to assist in the development of evidence\u00adbased guidelines for internationally adopted children. In addition to studies in the field of infectious diseases Dr. Staat and her colleagues have begun to explore the differences in neurological function between adopted and birth children using neuroimaging and psychological testing. Mark C. Steinhoff, MDDr. Steinhoff's Global Health Center group at Cincinnati Children's focuses on global immunization research, as well as on the development of improved diagnostic technologies. A Gates\u00adfunded project of maternal influenza immunization in Southern Nepal, has enrolled and immunized 3,645 mothers over a two\u00adyear period, and has completed all field activities. The research group is currently analyzing the effect of immunization on reduction of influenza disease in the mother, improved development of the fetus, and disease in the infants below six months of age. During the two\u00adyear surveillance period, influenza was present in 28 of 36 months, common for this tropical region. The group has completed a study with colleagues in South China to show that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the most common cause of severe respiratory admissions and leads to substantial cost for treatment. Our group carried out preliminary studies of a new RSV vaccine in pregnant women in Cincinnati as part of a multi\u00adcenter trial, and will continue the evaluation of this vaccine in other sites. A retrospective evaluation of the growth of Bangladesh infants who were randomized to receive pneumococcal or haemophilus vaccines in their infancy showed that, by 24 months of age, the infants who received pneumococcal vaccine were significantly taller and heavier than the infants who received Hib vaccine. These findings suggest that pneumococcal vaccine may have broader effects than the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease. Dr. Steinhoff is collaborating with the Cincinnati Children's Division of Emergency Medicine in carrying out research projects in Malawi. Initial data to assess the etiology of admission for respiratory disease suggests that influenza, RSV and other viruses are common in this southern hemisphere setting. Ming Tan, PhD Dr. Tan's research focused on two directions: 1) development of norovirus protruding (P) domain\u00adbased vaccines and vaccine platforms, and 2) elucidation of complex interactions between diverse noroviruses and their carbohydrate receptors or host attachment factors. For the first direction, he has shown the norovirus P particle as a potent vaccine against noroviruses and a useful vaccine platform for display of exogenous antigens. Chimeric P particles containing various foreign epitopes and antigens have been shown to be effective dual vaccine candidates. In addition, he developed other three P domain based polymers, the linear, network, and agglomerate polymers, as vaccines and vaccine platforms. Epitopes and antigens from different pathogens can be displayed by these polyvalent vaccine platforms for increased immunogenicity for multivalent vaccine development against different infectious diseases. For norovirus\u00adhost interactions, he discovered that human noroviruses interact with another group of cell surface carbohydrates, the sialic acid\u00adcontaining sialoglycoconjugates, in addition to the previously known histo\u00adblood group antigens. Further study of these new glycans as norovirus receptors or attachment factors will shed light into the complex interactions between the diverse noroviruses and polymorphic glycans. In addition, he found that GII.13 and GII.21 genotypes of noroviruses form a unique genetic lineage that interacts with glycan receptor through a completely new binding site. A number of papers have been published in the past year. His research outcomes provide valuable data to understand noroviruses and offer strategies for future development of vaccine and antivirals against norovirus and other infectious pathogens. Sing Sing Way, MD, PhD Dr. Way's group investigates host defense and the immune pathogenesis of infectious disease using representative models of human infection. Prenatal infection is a particular focus, infection during the early neonatal period, and maternal\u00ad fetal immunological tolerance. Results from work over the past few years have uncovered a critical need for immune suppression in the first few days following birth that protects against pathological inflammation triggered by colonization with commensal microbes. This immune suppression within newborn infants also makes them susceptible to disseminated infection. Other related publications have uncovered fundamental new aspects of T cell biology including differentiation into immune suppressive regulatory T cells and antigen\u00adspecificity each required for maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the developing fetus during pregnancy.Significant Publications Mulligan MJ, Bernstein DI, Winokur P, Rupp Dickey M, Stapleton JT, Edupuganti S, Spearman P, Ince D, Noah DL, Hill H, Bellamy AR, Group DHNVS.

CXCR3 protects infection-induced fetal wastage. J Clin Invest. 2015;125(4):1713-1725.Mother's Own Immune System May Cause Pregnancy Complications PUBLISHED MARCH 9, 2015 The Journal of Clinical Investigation Redirecting an expectant mother's immune cells to prevent them from attacking the fetus might reduce complications such as stillbirth and prematurity, according to a study that identifies a cell traffic pathway that plays a critical role in the process. The causes of premature birth and many other pregnancy complications are not completely known, but maternal infection is an important contributor, says senior author Sing Sing Way, MD, PhD, Division of Infectious Diseases. When infection strikes, maternal immune cells can \"overreact\" and attack the placenta as if it were a foreign invader. Way's study, published March 9, 2015, in The Journal of Clinical Investigation, identifies a pathway that could reduce these harmful overreactions. \"It might seem counterintuitive to prevent maternal immune cells from optimally penetrating into tissues,\" says Way. \"But restricting harmful immune cells' access to developmentally delicate placental tissue represents a highly innovative therapeutic strategy.\" The research team, led by Way and first author Vandana Chaturvedi, PhD, infected pregnant mice with Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterium commonly found in food supplies that causes invasive infection in pregnant women. It is often fatal to the fetus. Mice and human share this susceptibility. The researchers found that specialized subsets of first-responder immune cells \u2014 neutrophils and macrophages \u2014 rapidly infiltrate the placenta, producing high levels of a chemoattractant protein, CXCL9, which attracts harmful maternal T cells to attack genetically foreign placental-fetal tissue. The finding is significant because placental cells are not programmed to express chemoattractant proteins like CXCL9. The team found neutralizing CXCL9 activity by blocking its receptor on T cells efficiently protects against fetal injury after prenatal Listeria infections.Sing Sing Way, MD, PhDInfectious Diseases 82 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATION\"Restricting harmful immune cells' access to developmentally delicate placental tissue represents a highly innovative therapeutic strategy.\"Histological analysis of the placentas recovered from female mice during allogeneic pregnancies sired by ovalbumin expressing transgenic male mice showing no infection control compared with L. monocytogenes infection after H&E staining, along with anti-CD90.1 staining for (red) immunofluorescence junctional zone (JZ).
