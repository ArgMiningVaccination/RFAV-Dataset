Through our overnight, hands-on environmental science programs, we take more than 35,000 children and teens each year into our national parks to explore the outdoors, connect with their peers, discover themselves and develop a lasting relationship with the environment. Our multi-day programs get students from grades 4-12 out of the classroom and into nature where they'll learn scientific concepts first-hand and use them in real-time all while connecting to themselves, each other and the environment. From backpacking programs to summer day camps, a summer with NatureBridge is one spent outside, exploring and learning in our national parks. In the heart of California's Sierra Nevada mountain range, Yosemite National Park is home to one of the world's most striking and iconic views\u2014towering granite domes, gushing waterfalls and diverse habitats provide the perfect setting for hands-on environmental science education. Just north of the Golden Gate Bridge in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area sits historic Coastal Miwok land and modern day Marin Headlands. Our historic WWII military campus is surrounded by miles of trails along unique rock formations, through wildflowers, with scenic views of the beach and coastline. Home to alpine ridges, temperate rainforest, and rugged coastline, Olympic National Park boasts three stunning, distinct ecosystems. Amidst it all, the NatureBridge campus sits on the shore of glacially-carved Lake Crescent. Trails lead from the steps of our historic cabins to lush, old growth forest and salmon-filled waterways. Tucked away in the largest green space of the DC Metro Area is a hidden world of tall trees and clear streams. Prince William Forest's unbroken Piedmont forest ecosystem houses miles of trails that run through the park, offering new creeks, lakes, waterfalls and rare flowers at every turn. "}
