It greatly increases the throw weight of doctors and healers alike enabling them to more effectively and safely treat serious life threatening illnesses like cancer, heart disease and neurological disorders like Autism, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases - without resorting to dangerous pharmaceuticals, which in reality do little to resolve chronic syndromes. Though this is a medical text it is also comprehensible for patients, who not only need to treat themselves, but have to understand what their doctors and practitioners are and, most importantly, are not doing for them.
