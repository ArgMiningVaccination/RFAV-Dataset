No. 62/709,338 filed Jan. 17, 2018, and the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a nano-crystallized herbal ingredient-containing package. The present invention also relates to a method of preparing herbal decoction from the nano-crystallized herbal ingredient-containing package within a relatively shorter period of time than the conventional way of preparing herbal decoction from the herbal ingredients.BACKGROUND Traditionally, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is administrated in a form of decoction, in which several herbs are boiled in water for about an hour, and the remaining concentrated liquid is used for consumption for better health management. However, traditional decoctions have some disadvantages to users, such as (i) difficulties in ensuring quality of the herbal ingredients, (ii) hour-long time required to prepare, (iii) inconvenience in transportation and storage of liquid. Historically, different kinds of formulations have been developed in response to these shortcomings. These strategies include traditional preparations of wan (pills), san (powder) and the modern formulations of granules. In recent years, some Chinese pharmaceutical companies have developed more than 600 kinds of individual herb granules and 200 kinds of herbal formulae, which have been widely used in clinical practice. Nevertheless, there are more evidences demonstrating that contents of constituents in an herbal decoction prepared in a traditional way with boiling may be different from those found in an identical physical mixture of granules [1,2]. It is postulated and widely accepted that some other new compounds are to be generated from herb-herb interactions during the boiling process. Therefore, the health beneficial effects generating from the conventional TCM decoction boiling method cannot be simply physically replaced by a mixture of individual ingredient granules. Nowadays, the commercial coffee capsule has revolutionized coffee drinking habit from the old days. Development of a convenient way to get TCM decoction from a food processor for preparing a freshly brewed coffee using coffee capsule such as from a single-serve brewer is attractive. Users can prepare their own cup of herbal decoction from herbal ingredient-containing capsule within a minute. However, technical difficulties in limited dissolution rate may hinder the development of herbal decoction capsule because many herbal ingredients are poorly soluble or even insoluble in water. Raw or coarse herbal materials or even granule form of herbal extract have not had enough surface area for contact with the solvent during brewing, which lengthens the preparation time and limits the number and/or type of herbal ingredients to be used for preparing an herbal decoction. Nanocrystals, a carrier-free colloidal delivery system in nano-sized range, is a decent approach to solve these difficulties by reducing the ingredient's particle size, thus enhancing the dissolution rate and the solubility as well [3]. For example, the Chinese patent CN103211759B disclosed a formulation which is a carrier free colloidal system and contains a stabilizer preferably selected from hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose. The preparation process disclosed in that Chinese patent appears to apply ball milling and spray drying techniques to obtain nano-crystalline particulate. Another example is the Chinese published patent application CN102895451A which disclosed a broad-spectrum anti-viral nano-sized traditional Chinese medicine including herbal extracts from Salvia miltiorrhiza. The preparation process disclosed in the second example also appears to apply ball milling and spray drying techniques to obtain nano-crystalline particulate of the herbal extracts. However, none of these examples provides a means for extracting or eluting the herbal ingredients from the nano-crystalline particulate in a more efficient way like the use of conventional single-serve coffee capsule to prepare a coffee from a coffee machine. Therefore, a convenient yet cost- and time-effective means to prepare an herbal decoction while the potential herb-herb interactions generated in the TCM decoction is preserved is utmost needed.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, a first aspect of the present invention relates to a package including single or multiple herbal ingredients which are nano-crystallized from their corresponding natural source(s) in the absence of using any solvent for extraction, one or more non-additive and anti-caking spacers, and optionally one or more stabilizing agents that are food-safe and do not attribute to the functional properties of the resultant herbal decoction. In one embodiment, the package is a container including at least a side wall, a top wall and a bottom wall forming a cavity for housing said single or multiple nano-crystallized herbal ingredients, one or more non-additive and anti-caking spacers, and optionally one or more stabilizing agents. The housing can be made of polymer, metal and/or an alloy thereof. In another embodiment, the package is configured for a food processor to brew said single or multiple nano-crystallized herbal ingredients in the presence of a solvent in order to prepare an herbal decoction. The food processor can be a specially designed machine for said package or any commercially available food or beverage making machine. In other embodiment, the package is configured such that said single or multiple nano-crystallized herbal ingredients are directly dissolved into or diffused from an internal porous structure of the package into a solvent. The internal porous can be made of polymers and/or fibers such as cellulose. In yet another embodiment, said single or multiple nano-crystallized herbal ingredients are generated by ultrafine grinding and/or high-pressure pulverization with or without said one or more stabilizing agents. In an exemplary embodiment, said single or multiple nano-crystallized herbal ingredients have an average particle size of equal to or less than about 1,000 nm; said one or more non-additive and anti-caking spacers have an average particles size of about 0.5 to 5 mm. Preferably, said one or more non-additive and anti-caking spacers have an average particle size of about 1 to 3 mm. In one embodiment, the weight percentage of different components in the present package is as follows: about 5-50 wt. % of said single or multiple nano-crystallized herbal ingredients; about 45-90 wt. % of said one or more non-additive spacers; about 0-5 wt. % of said one or more stabilizing agents. In other embodiment, said single or multiple nano-crystallized herbal ingredients comprise: nano-crystals of part of flower, leaves, seed, fruit stem, root and/or rhizome of species under kingdom Plantae; and/or nano-crystals of part of cap, stalk, hyphae, and/or spores of species under kingdom Fungi. In another embodiment, said single or multiple nano-crystallized herbal ingredients comprise nano-crystals of any Chinese herbal medicine listed in Chinese Pharmacopeia. In certain embodiments, said single or multiple herbal ingredient nano-crystals are prepared by ultrafine grinding or high-pressure pulverisation of the corresponding raw or coarse herbal materials. In yet another embodiment, said single or multiple nano-crystallized herbal ingredients comprise water-soluble, poorly water-soluble and/or water-insoluble herbal ingredients. In other embodiment, said one or more non-additive and anti-caking spacers comprise natural and synthetic materials. Preferably, said natural material comprises one or more of sesame, millet and/or quinoa; said synthetic material comprises one or more of amorphous silica, and/or zirconium oxide in any form such as bead or powder. In one embodiment, said one or more stabilizing agents comprise ionic and/or non-ionic stabilizing agents. Preferably, said ionic stabilizing agents comprise sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate, and/or dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate; said polyethylene glycol succinate, pectin, and/or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. Another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of preparing an herbal decoction from the package of the present invention. The method includes providing a flow of solvent under an elevated pressure and at an elevated temperature to said package such that the solvent flows through an opening of the package towards the nano-crystals of said single or multiple nano-crystallized herbal ingredients in order to process or brew for a first period of time, or providing a solvent under atmospheric pressure and at an elevated temperature to said package for a second period of time until said solvent substantially dissolves all the nano-crystals of said single or multiple nano-crystallized herbal ingredients to result in the herbal decoction. In an exemplary embodiment, the solvent is provided at about 75 to 100\u00b0 C. In one embodiment, the flow of solvent is provided by a food processor under the elevated pressure and at the elevated temperature to said package. Preferably, the opening of the package is created at the time when said flow of solvent is provided by said food processor. The elevated pressure is about 1.01325 to 20 bars. In another embodiment, the solvent is provided under the atmospheric pressure and at the elevated temperature of about 75 to 100\u00b0 C. until the nano-crystals of the single or multiple nano-crystallized herbal ingredients are substantially dissolved into said solvent. In this embodiment, the nano-crystals of said single or multiple nano-crystallized herbal ingredients may be diffused from said package through a porous structure or directly dissolved into the solvent by means of mixing the same with the solvent in a container. By this way, the time duration for the second period of time the nano-crystals are substantially dissolved into the solvent is much longer than that for processing or brewing the nano-crystals under the elevated pressure. Preferably, the second period of time is about 10 to 20 times longer than the first period of time according to the present method. More preferably, the first period of time is equal to or less than a minute, while the second period of time is about 10 to 20 minutes in order to have the herbal decoction prepared according to the present method.
