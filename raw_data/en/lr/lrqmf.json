{"title": "Peru - Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Peru international travel information and Travel Advisory", "sitename": null, "date": "2023-06-01", "cleaned_text": "Lima](https://pe.usembassy.gov/u-s-embassy-lima/) Avenida La Encalada cdra. U.S. - Cusco Av. Entry: Requirements for Exit: Travel with Minors: Regardless of nationality, all children who are traveling with both birth parents are required to have a valid passport and the necessary visa or citizenship of the country where they are traveling. Peruvian immigration procedures are complex for minors traveling without one or both parents/legal guardians. For entry/exit from Peru, U.S. citizen minors under the age of 18, traveling alone (or with only one parent), generally do not require additional documentation if entering as a tourist for less than 183 days. However, if the stay lasts more than 183 days, then a Permiso Notarial de Viaje is required (see below). U.S. citizen minors who are dual national Peruvians, traveling alone (or with only one parent), require a Permiso Notarial de Viaje. Furthermore, step-parents or guardians accompanying a dual U.S.-Peruvian citizen minor must provide a Permiso Notarial de Viaje from the non-traveling minor's parents (as listed on the birth certificate). Finally, if an accompanying parent has sole custody, legal documentation is required (such as a foreign court-approved custody document stating sole custody, a death certificate, a Peruvian court-approved document for travel, or a birth certificate listing only one parent). A Permiso Notarial de Viaje is a written, notarized authorization from the non-traveling parent(s). Peruvian immigration will not accept a document notarized by the U.S. Embassy or a document notarized by a U.S. notary in lieu of a Permiso Notarial de Viaje. Please be aware that these authorizations are valid for 30 days and one trip only. How to get a Permiso Notarial de Viaje: The U.S. Embassy is unable to assist travelers who are prevented from traveling for lack of a Permiso Notarial de Viaje. HIV Restrictions: The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to, or foreign residents of, Peru. Find information on [dual nationality](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/Advice-about-Possible-Loss-of-US-Nationality-Dual-Nationality/Dual-Nationality.html), [prevention of international child abduction](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/prevention/stopping-abduction-in-progress.html), and [customs regulations](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/customs-and-import.html) on our websites. Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack - including knives, firearms, and vehicles - to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: U.S. Embassy Lima enforces a Restricted Travel Policy for Embassy personnel, which is based on its assessment of conditions and developments throughout the country. See the Overseas Security and Advisory Council's Country Security Report for Peru. See the latest [Travel Advisory for Peru](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/peru-travel-advisory.html). The VRAEM (Valley of the Apur\u00edmac, Ene, and Mantaro Rivers) is particularly remote and a known safe haven for narcotraffickers and the last operational remnants of the Shining Path terrorist group. For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page. Crime: Crime is a widespread problem in Peru. There is little government presence in many remote areas of the Andes and Amazon basin. Illicit activities, such as illegal mining, logging, and coca production, are common. Drug trafficking and other criminal activity, combined with poor infrastructure, limit the capability and effectiveness of Peruvian law enforcement in these areas. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens along the Colombian border and in the VRAEM, as U.S. government personnel are restricted from traveling in these regions. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. International Financial Scams: See the [Department of State ](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information. Financial scams are prevalent in Peru. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police and contact the U.S. Embassy in Lima. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html). We can: Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Telephone (answered 24 hours): +51-1-618-2000 Tourism: The tourism industry, including adventure activities (e.g. paragliding, sandboarding, etc.), is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. U.S. citizens are encouraged to pay attention to waiver and liability policies of tour companies, as they may vary or not exist. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html). Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business. Ayahuasca/Kambo/Hallucinogens: Traditional hallucinogens, often referred to as ayahuasca or kambo, are often marketed to travelers as \"ceremonies\" or \"spiritual cleansing,\" and typically contain dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a strong hallucinogen that is illegal in the United States and many other countries. Drugs: Customs Currency Regulations: Artifacts: Animal Products/Plants: Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information. Special Circumstances: Many popular destinations in Peru are remote. These areas have few facilities that are able to provide advanced or emergency medical care. Seismic Activity: Earthquakes are common throughout Peru. On May 26, 2019, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake struck the Loreto region of Peru. One fatality in the Cajamarca region and 11 injuries as well as isolated power outages and some infrastructure damage were reported. Legal Issues in Peru: Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: LGBTQI+ Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTI events in Peru. See our [LGBTQI+ Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: Peruvian law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include ramps, special cashiers for those with disabilities, and elevators. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, and common in lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. There is a significant difference between Lima (and other large cities) and the rest of the country.

Medical Care: For emergency services in Peru, dial 113. Ambulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Lima and other major cities. Training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor's prescription. Check with the [Government of Peru](https://www.digemid.minsa.gob.pe/) to ensure the medication is legal in Peru. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Visitors are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with local law and driving customs before attempting to operate vehicles. Traffic Laws: Traffic laws are often ignored and rarely enforced, creating dangerous conditions for drivers and pedestrians. Public Transportation: Many buses are overcrowded, poorly maintained, and lack safety features such as seat belts. See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information. Visit the website of Peru's [national tourist office](https://www.gob.pe/mincetur) and national authority responsible for road safety. Aviation Safety Oversight: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Peru's Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Peru's air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA's safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa). Maritime Travel: Mariners planning travel to Peru should check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts).
