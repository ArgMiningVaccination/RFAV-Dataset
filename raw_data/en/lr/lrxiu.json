Anthroposophy develops an image of the human being, whereby the human being - completely connected with the soil, plants, animals and the climate - is able to penetrate nature in such a way that a personal relationship with the spiritual world of beings, which appears in it, can develop. Out of this spiritual relationship you can work practically, for example with the biodynamic preparations, you can shape the farm into a living organism and you can align your commitment with the big picture of the earth as a living being. Where does the human ability to cultivate nature come from? How far are we as human beings actually allowed to cultivate nature agriculturally? These are some of the questions we will look at in this course.
