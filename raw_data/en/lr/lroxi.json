It is also known as an immunomodulatory hormone. Experimental studies have shown that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D, exerts immunologic activities on multiple components of the innate and adaptive immune system as well as endothelial membrane stability. Association between low levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and increased risk of developing several immune-related diseases and disorders, including psoriasis, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, sepsis, respiratory infection, and COVID-19, has been observed. Accordingly, a number of clinical trials aiming to determine the efficacy of administration of vitamin D and its metabolites for treatment of these diseases have been conducted with variable outcomes. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that some individuals might benefit from vitamin D more or less than others as high inter-individual difference in broad gene expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to vitamin D supplementation has been observed. Although it is still debatable what level of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is optimal, it is advisable to increase vitamin D intake and have sensible sunlight exposure to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L), and preferably at 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L) to achieve the optimal overall health benefits of vitamin D.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-07-15", "cleaned_text": "on Human Health and Disease [https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12072097](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12072097) [Vitamin D on Immune Function]( /journal/nutrients/special_issues/VitaminD_Immune_Function )) Abstract: [2](#B2-nutrients-12-02097)]. Both the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and metabolizing enzymes are expressed by various types of immune cells including lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells [ [3](#B3-nutrients-12-02097), [4](#B4-nutrients-12-02097)]. Experimental studies have shown that vitamin D has significant biologic activities on the innate and adaptive immune systems. Animal studies have demonstrated that administration of vitamin D or its metabolites leads to changes in the occurrence and progression of various immune-related diseases [ [1](#B1-nutrients-12-02097), [5](#B5-nutrients-12-02097)]. This supports the clinical and epidemiological data that link vitamin D with the incidence and severity of many disorders such as psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and infectious diseases [ [2](#B2-nutrients-12-02097)] ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-02097-f001)). The purpose of the present review is to provide a high-level summary of the biologic effects of vitamin D on the immune system and the relationship between vitamin D and several types of immune-related diseases and conditions. This review also aims to give some perspective about the heterogeneity of evidence on the impact of vitamin D on prevention and treatment of immune-related diseases and to introduce the concept individual responsiveness to vitamin D as a potential explanation for such heterogeneity. 2. Physiology of Vitamin D 2.1. Sources, Synthesis, and Metabolism of Vitamin D [2](#B2-nutrients-12-02097), [6](#B6-nutrients-12-02097)]. 1,25(OH)2D exerts its physiologic functions in the target tissue by binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the nucleus where it leads to up- or down-regulation of a multitude of genes [ [7](#B7-nutrients-12-02097)]. It should be noted that the main site of conversion of 25(OH)D into the systemically bioavailable 1,25(OH)2D is the kidneys. CYP27B1 is also expressed by many other tissues including activated macrophages, parathyroid glands, microglia, breast, colon, and keratinocytes where 1,25(OH)2D is produced and its autocrine and paracrine functions [ [1](#B1-nutrients-12-02097), [4](#B4-nutrients-12-02097), [5](#B5-nutrients-12-02097)]. 2.2. Skeletal Effects of Vitamin D [2](#B2-nutrients-12-02097), [6](#B6-nutrients-12-02097)]. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D forms an endocrine system together with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) to regulate calcium and phosphate homeostasis [ [8](#B8-nutrients-12-02097)]. As a part of negative feedback loops, 1,25(OH)2D directly inhibits PTH production, leading to a decrease in bone resorption and increased urinary calcium excretion, and induces FGF23 production by the osteocytes, leading to an increase in urinary phosphate excretion [ [6](#B6-nutrients-12-02097), [8](#B8-nutrients-12-02097), [9](#B9-nutrients-12-02097)]. 2.3. D and 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels [10](#B10-nutrients-12-02097), [11](#B11-nutrients-12-02097)]. It is also unknown whether maintenance of serum vitamin D itself has its own effect on modulating immune function. However, historical evidence suggests that our hunter gatherer forefathers maintained their circulating vitamin D levels in the range of 10-50 ng/mL (25-125 nmol/L). Indigenous populations such as Maasai herders and Hadza tribesmen were found to have serum 25(OH)D levels in [ [12](#B12-nutrients-12-02097), [13](#B13-nutrients-12-02097), [14](#B14-nutrients-12-02097)]. These levels are consistent with those reported in populational studies to be associated with the lowest risk of several types of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, and all-cause mortality [ [2](#B2-nutrients-12-02097), [10](#B10-nutrients-12-02097), [14](#B14-nutrients-12-02097), [15](#B15-nutrients-12-02097)]. To maintain these blood levels with minimal sunlight exposure, a person would require ingestion of 4000-6000 IUs of vitamin D daily, which would maintain serum vitamin D levels in the range of 20-40 ng/mL (50-100 nmol/L) and ng/mL (50-100 nmol/L) [ [11](#B11-nutrients-12-02097)]. The recommended dosage for vitamin D intake by the Endocrine Society Guidelines on Vitamin D for treatment and prevention for vitamin D deficiency is shown in [Table 1](#nutrients-12-02097-t001). 3. Effects of Vitamin D on Innate Immunity 3.1. Macrophages and Monocytes [16](#B16-nutrients-12-02097)]. Later, subsequent studies have identified the explanation for the therapeutic effects of cod liver oil and sunlight. In the presence of infection, activated macrophages and monocytes, induced by toll-like receptor signaling and exposure to inflammatory cytokines such as interferon- (IFN-), strongly express CYP27B1 which into Then, 1,25(OH)2D antimicrobial activities macrophages and monocytes in an autocrine fashion via VDR-RXR signaling, which, in turn, stimulates by destabilizing microbial membranes [ [19](#B19-nutrients-12-02097), [20](#B20-nutrients-12-02097)]. It also exhibits direct antiviral activities against many respiratory viruses by disrupting viral envelopes and altering viability of host target cells [ [20](#B20-nutrients-12-02097), [21](#B21-nutrients-12-02097), [22](#B22-nutrients-12-02097)]. This process is especially robust in granulomatous inflammation such as TB, fungal infections, sarcoidosis, and some lymphomas. The macrophage production of 1,25(OH)2D not only is for the purpose of upregulating the production of cathelicidin LL-37 but also produces it so that it can exit the cell and influence nearby lymphocyte function [ [2](#B2-nutrients-12-02097)] ( [Figure 2](#nutrients-12-02097-f002)). However, an unintended consequence of this paracrine function is that the macrophages produce an excess amount of 1,25(OH)2D that enters the circulation and an unregulated fashion stimulates intestinal calcium absorption and bone calcium mobilization resulting in hypercalciuria and hypercalcemia [ [23](#B23-nutrients-12-02097), [24](#B24-nutrients-12-02097)]. This is more likely to occur when circulating levels of 25(OH)D are above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) [ [11](#B11-nutrients-12-02097)], which is the explanation for why patients with granulomatous disorders including sarcoidosis develop hypercalcemia during the summer [ [25](#B25-nutrients-12-02097)]. 3.2. Antigen-Presenting [29](#B29-nutrients-12-02097)] ( [Figure 2](#nutrients-12-02097-f002)). This results in decrease in antigen presentation and production of interleukin-12 (IL-12), and an increase in production cytokine [ [29](#B29-nutrients-12-02097), [30](#B30-nutrients-12-02097), [31](#B31-nutrients-12-02097)]. 1,25(OH)2D is also shown to suppress the expression of toll-like receptors on the monocytes and inhibit the production of some inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6, and IL-17 [ [5](#B5-nutrients-12-02097), [32](#B32-nutrients-12-02097), [33](#B33-nutrients-12-02097)]. In addition, experimental studies have suggested that differentiation and function of natural killer (NK) cells can be modulated by 1,25(OH)2D treatment. However, whether 1,25(OH)2D induces or inhibits NK cell function is still unclear as data regarding the influence of 1,25(OH)2D on NK cells are inconsistent [ Endothelial and the primary human stabilized vascular endothelium, and that vitamin D3, normally circulating at about 100 times higher level than 1,25(OH)2D3, was at least 10 times more potent than 1,25(OH)2D3 and more than thousand times more potent than 25(OH)D3 in stabilizing the endothelium. Studies have also shown that 1,25(OH)2D3 is a transcriptional regulator of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), causing up-regulation of eNOS gene expression and therefore increased endothelial production of nitric oxide [ [38](#B38-nutrients-12-02097), [39](#B39-nutrients-12-02097)]. Interestingly, Molinari et al. [ [40](#B40-nutrients-12-02097)] observed that the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on endothelial nitric oxide production occurred most robustly within one minute after administrating the compound, implying that the action of 1,25(OH)2D3 was non-genomic. Activation of VDR by 1,25(OH)2D at the endothelial cell membrane is shown to increase eNOS activity via intracellular second messenger intracellular calcium concentration. Activation of VDR also activates eNOS via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase b (PI3K/Akt) pathway that triggers phosphorylation of serine-1779 on eNOS [ [41](#B41-nutrients-12-02097)]. Furthermore, Cuenca et al. [ [42](#B42-nutrients-12-02097)] showed in a uremic rat model using the immunofluorescence technique that 1,25(OH)2D2 promoted vascular endothelial-cadherin-based cell-cell junctions and inhibited F-actin stress fiber organization, thereby preventing the formation of endothelial intracellular gaps and attenuating endothelial damage in the presence of chronic kidney disease. Taken together, it is evident that vitamin D and its metabolites exert pleiotropic effects on the vascular endothelium that are protective against vascular dysfunction and tissue injury as a result of local and systemic inflammation. 3.4. Intestinal Epithelium and Paneth Cells [43](#B43-nutrients-12-02097), [44](#B44-nutrients-12-02097)]. It promotes mucosal barrier function by enhancing the expression of intracellular pathogen recognition proteins and epithelial membrane junction proteins [ [45](#B45-nutrients-12-02097), [46](#B46-nutrients-12-02097)]. Moreover, 1,25(OH)2D induces the production and secretion of antimicrobial peptides by the intestinal epithelial cells, Paneth cells, and intraepithelial lymphocytes [ [47](#B47-nutrients-12-02097), [48](#B48-nutrients-12-02097)]. These result in limitation of gut bacterial translocation into the interstitium and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, which are believed to involve in the pathogenesis of multiple autoinflammatory and metabolic disorders [ [49](#B49-nutrients-12-02097), [50](#B50-nutrients-12-02097)]. 4. Effects of Vitamin D on Adaptive Immunity 4.1. T lymphocytes [51](#B51-nutrients-12-02097), [52](#B52-nutrients-12-02097)]. Further analysis revealed that peripheral blood monocytes express VDR but that resting T lymphocytes did not. When resting T lymphocytes were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin, they became activated and with the activation, T cells expressed the VDR [ [51](#B51-nutrients-12-02097), [52](#B52-nutrients-12-02097)]. Moreover, activated T lymphocytes are known to express CYP27B1 that mediates local conversion of 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH)2D which is believed to stimulate [53](#B53-nutrients-12-02097), [54](#B54-nutrients-12-02097)] TH1 and TH17 to TH2 immune profile by suppressing TNF-) and also promote differentiation of regulatory T cells (Treg) both directly and indirectly via its interaction with antigen-presenting cells, resulting in a suppression of proinflammatory state [ [59](#B59-nutrients-12-02097), [60](#B60-nutrients-12-02097)]. This is believed to be one of the explanations by which vitamin D could exert protective effects against autoimmune diseases. [61](#B61-nutrients-12-02097), [62](#B62-nutrients-12-02097)]. Studies have shown that decreased CD4/CD8 ratio, an indicator of increased immune activation, was associated with low levels of 25(OH)D [ [63](#B63-nutrients-12-02097)] and that giving 5000-10,000 IUs of vitamin D3 was associated with an increase in CD4/CD8 ratio, reflecting immune suppression [ [64](#B64-nutrients-12-02097), [65](#B65-nutrients-12-02097)]. However, little is known about the direct influence of vitamin D on CTL. The effects of 1,25(OH)2D on differentiation, proliferation, and functions of CTL are likely mediated by both direct intracrine activation of VDR and alteration of cytokines signaling via T helper cells and antigen-presenting cells [62](#B62-nutrients-12-02097)]. 4.2. B lymphocytes was found that 1,25(OH)2D inhibited immunoglobulin synthesis and therefore could potentially be detrimental to the immune system. However, a variety of studies have demonstrated that just as 1,25(OH)2D modulates T cell function so too does it regulate B-cell activity. When in a hyperactive state, 1,25(OH)2D appears to dampen the immunoglobulin immune response by a variety of mechanisms. It inhibits plasma cell formation and inducing apoptosis of both activated B cells and plasma cells [ [67](#B67-nutrients-12-02097), [68](#B68-nutrients-12-02097)]. It also inhibits cytokine-mediated B-cell activation by acting cells, anti-inflammatory cytokines production (IL-10, CCR10) and suppresses the differentiation from mature B cells to plasma cells and class-switched memory B cells [ [66](#B66-nutrients-12-02097), [69](#B69-nutrients-12-02097), [70](#B70-nutrients-12-02097)]. It is believed that, by controlling B-cell activity and B-cell transformation into the plasma cells, 1,25(OH)2D helps reduce autoantibody production, thereby reducing risk for antibody-mediated autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus [ [66](#B66-nutrients-12-02097), [71](#B71-nutrients-12-02097)]. It has also been suggested that lymphocytes also have the capacity to generate 1,25(OH)2D. What is known is that only B lymphocytes can express CYP27B1 and that 25(OH)D in vitro at 25 times the level of 1,25(OH)2D can cause similar biologic responses as 1,25(OH)2D in B lymphocytes [ [66](#B66-nutrients-12-02097)]. However, there has not been any direct demonstration that B lymphocytes can produce 1,25(OH)2D. 5. Vitamin D and Immune-Related Diseases 5.1. Psoriasis [2](#B2-nutrients-12-02097)]. However, 1,25(OH)2D and its analogs have never been successfully developed for treating any cancer. An attempt was made to treat preleukemia; however, not only did 1,25(OH)2D3 cause undesirable hypercalcemia, but also ultimately the leukemic cells became resistant to the antiproliferative activity [ [72](#B72-nutrients-12-02097)]. Psoriasis, however, is a non-malignant hyperproliferative disorder of the skin that is a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting 2-3% of global population [ [73](#B73-nutrients-12-02097)]. It has been well documented that the epidermis is the major site for the cutaneous production of vitamin D3 [ [74](#B74-nutrients-12-02097)]. It was also recognized that keratinocytes express VDR and 1,25(OH)2D was extremely effective at physiologic concentrations not only in inhibiting cultured keratinocyte proliferation, but also in inducing their terminal differentiation [ [75](#B75-nutrients-12-02097), [76](#B76-nutrients-12-02097)]. These observations gave rise to the idea that 1,25(OH)2D could be developed for treating this hyperproliferative skin disorder [ [77](#B77-nutrients-12-02097)]. [78](#B78-nutrients-12-02097)]. Further studies revealed that only about 20% of patients with psoriasis had fibroblasts with a partial resistance to the antiproliferative activity of 1,25(OH)2D3. It was observed that cultured keratinocytes from psoriasis patients responded to the antiproliferative and pro-differentiating activity of 1,25(OH)2D3 as well as cultured keratinocytes obtained from neonatal foreskins [ [79](#B79-nutrients-12-02097)]. This led to a pilot study to evaluate topical and oral 1,25(OH)2D3 to determine its clinical effectiveness [ [79](#B79-nutrients-12-02097)]. However, there was concern about the hypercalcemic potential of clinically using 1,25(OH)2D3. This prompted the development of an analog of 1,25(OH)2D3 that was considered to have less calcemic activity. This analog, calcipotriene (50 mcg/g), was found to be reasonably effective when topically applied for treating psoriasis [ [80](#B80-nutrients-12-02097)]. No significant hypercalcemia was observed unless large body surface was treated. However, the major side effect was skin irritation that occurred mainly on the face and therefore it was not recommended for treating psoriasis on the face and other sensitive skin areas [ [80](#B80-nutrients-12-02097)]. 1,25(OH)2D3 was demonstrated to be effective at 15 mcg/g and also was found to be safe and effective and did not cause skin irritation. 1,25(OH)2D3 was finally developed as a topical treatment and formulated as 3 mcg/g [ [77](#B77-nutrients-12-02097)]. Other analogs have since been developed and are available for treating psoriasis skin lesions that usually affect less than 10% of the body surface. Oral 1,25(OH)2D3 was also found to be safe and effective but was not developed as a pharmaceutical because of concerns about hypercalcemia. [81](#B81-nutrients-12-02097)]. 1,25(OH)2D exerts inhibitory effects against the inflammatory activity associated with psoriasis not only by suppressing dendritic cell's differentiation, chemotaxis, and antigen presentation, but also by inhibiting the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines such [83](#B83-nutrients-12-02097)]. The likely explanation is that patients with psoriasis are less likely to expose their skin to sunlight which is a major source of vitamin D. However, correcting vitamin D deficiency may be beneficial. [84](#B84-nutrients-12-02097)]. Another pilot study giving daily 35,000 IUs of vitamin D3 to 9 patients with psoriasis and 16 patients with vitiligo who were vitamin D-deficient or insufficient for six months demonstrated a significant improvement in psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) in all psoriatic patients and 25-75% repigmentation in 14 of 16 vitiligo patients, without development of any complications suggestive of vitamin D toxicity including hypercalcemia, kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis, or hypercalciuria [ [85](#B85-nutrients-12-02097)]. On the other hand, a one-year study giving 100,000 IUs per month of vitamin D3 or placebo to psoriatic patients for one year did not demonstrate a direct benefit of vitamin D supplementation on disease activity [ [86](#B86-nutrients-12-02097)]. The study however revealed that the severity of psoriasis was less for those with higher blood levels of 25(OH)D [ [86](#B86-nutrients-12-02097)]. Based on the evidence from these studies, it is advisable to test and treat patients with psoriasis for vitamin D deficiency in order to maintain their serum 25(OH)D levels in a preferred range of 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L) [ [11](#B11-nutrients-12-02097)]. [87](#B87-nutrients-12-02097)] showed that as result of this dosing technique, doses of 2-4 \u00b5g/night of 1,25(OH)2D3 were well tolerated by psoriatic patients. Ezquerra et al. demonstrated that a combination of acitretin and oral 1,25(OH)2D3 resulted in a faster reduction of PASI score in patients of chronic plaque psoriasis than acitretin alone [ [88](#B88-nutrients-12-02097)]. Given the small sample sizes in each study, more studies with a larger number of participants are warranted to demonstrate the efficacy of oral 1,25(OH)2D for treatment of psoriasis. 5.2. Type 1 Diabetes [89](#B89-nutrients-12-02097)]. Many theories have been proposed to explain the epidemic such as exposure to certain toxic substances [ [90](#B90-nutrients-12-02097)] and coxsackievirus B infections that trigger the development of autoimmunity [ [91](#B91-nutrients-12-02097)]. It is however likely that this can be explained by the lack of sunlight exposure resulting in a high rate of vitamin D deficiency in Finnish population especially in northern Finland. Finns, similar Norwegians living in the far north, are unable to produce vitamin D3 in their skin from sun exposure for more than half a year during the winter and early spring and late fall [ [13](#B13-nutrients-12-02097), [92](#B92-nutrients-12-02097), [93](#B93-nutrients-12-02097)]. This is also supported by the previous report that type 1 diabetes is more common in countries with high latitude and short daytime period [ [94](#B94-nutrients-12-02097)]. [95](#B95-nutrients-12-02097), [96](#B96-nutrients-12-02097)]. Administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 was found to enhance Treg and inhibit TH1, leading to a reduction in the incidence of type 1 diabetes in the non-obese diabetic mouse model [ [60](#B60-nutrients-12-02097)]. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 promoted insulin secretion directly by its interaction with VDR in the pancreatic cells [ [97](#B97-nutrients-12-02097)]. These mechanisms help explain how vitamin D has a potential protective and therapeutic role in reducing risk for developing type 1 diabetes and support observational studies that increasing vitamin D intake for children was associated with a lower risk for developing type 1 diabetes [ [98](#B98-nutrients-12-02097)]. [98](#B98-nutrients-12-02097)]. A Finnish cohort study of 10,366 children showed that those who were given daily 2000 IUs of vitamin D3 during their first year of life had a 88% reduction in the risk of developing type 1 diabetes (relative risk, the other hand, studies that evaluated the benefit of maternal vitamin D supplement for prevention of type 1 diabetes in offspring were unable to demonstrate the association [ [104](#B104-nutrients-12-02097)]. This is not unexpected especially if this autoimmune disorder is initiated during childhood and not in utero. 5.3. Multiple Sclerosis [105](#B105-nutrients-12-02097)]. Living below the latitude of 35\u00b0 for the first 10 years of life is associated with approximately 50% lower risk of developing MS [ [106](#B106-nutrients-12-02097)]. Munger et al. reported in a prospective nested case-control study of 148 MS patients and 296 controls that the risk of MS decreased by 41% for every 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) increase in serum 25(OH)D levels above (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36-0.97) [ [107](#B107-nutrients-12-02097)]. The same group also showed that women who ingested more than 400 IUs of vitamin D per day had a 41% decreased risk of developing MS [ [108](#B108-nutrients-12-02097)]. It is therefore believed that vitamin D deficiency plays a role in the development of dysregulated T helper cells, CTL, NK cells, B cells resulting in autoinflammation of the central nervous system that damages neurons and oligodendrocytes seen in MS [ [109](#B109-nutrients-12-02097), [110](#B110-nutrients-12-02097)]. [111](#B111-nutrients-12-02097)]. Interestingly, vitamin D response elements have been identified in the promoter region of the HLA-DRB1 gene, and its expression can be altered by activation of VDR by 1,25(OH)2D, strengthening the link between vitamin D and MS [ [112](#B112-nutrients-12-02097), [113](#B113-nutrients-12-02097)]. [114](#B114-nutrients-12-02097)]. Most of the existing clinical trials included relatively small number of patients, and dosages of vitamin D given for treatment vary significantly across the studies. [85](#B85-nutrients-12-02097)]. The authors' (MFH) personal clinical experience that treatment with a very high dose of vitamin D supplementation (50,000 IUs/day or 1000 IUs/kg/day) to 200-300 ng/mL (500-750 nmol/L) was found to be remarkably effective in controlling and/or improving symptoms and improving MRI findings in five MS patients who either failed to respond to or refused conventional MS therapy. The risk of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria was minimized by advising the patients to strictly follow a zero calcium diet. This required complete elimination of all dairy products and any other foods that contain significant amounts of calcium. A 52-year-old female MS patient was treated with 40,000 IUs/day (1000 IUs/kg/day) of vitamin D3 for five years which was found to improve her neurological symptoms. She was advised to avoid all dietary sources of calcium. Serum 25(OH)D was maintained at approximately 250 ng/mL (625 nmol/L) and her total calcium levels transiently increased at approximately 12 months. A review of her diet had revealed that she was eating some vegetables that contained a significant amount of calcium. This supports that calcium was eliminated from her diet and her serum calcium returned to normal levels and have been maintained in a normal range for 5 years. During the first year, serum PTH levels were in the low normal range and serum 1,25(OH)2D levels were above the normal range. After the change in her diet both returned into the normal range and have been maintained in the normal range ( [Figure 3](#nutrients-12-02097-f003)). No hypercalciuria, kidney stones, or nephrocalcinosis was observed. [Figure 4](#nutrients-12-02097-f004)demonstrates changes in serum levels of calcium and calciotropic hormones in a 32-year-old male who refused conventional therapy and was given 54,000 IUs vitamin D3 daily. He was able to rapidly increase his circulating level of 25(OH)D and reach a plateau of approximately 250 ng/mL (625 nmol/L) within 2 months. This has been maintained for 4 months and the serum PTH and 1,25(OH)2D remained normal as well as his 24-h urine calcium excretion. 5.4. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases [115](#B115-nutrients-12-02097), [116](#B116-nutrients-12-02097), [117](#B117-nutrients-12-02097), [118](#B118-nutrients-12-02097)]. This is because they are unable to efficiently form micelles and chylomicron to absorb vitamin D in their gastrointestinal tract [ [115](#B115-nutrients-12-02097), [116](#B116-nutrients-12-02097)]. Therefore, these patients should be screened for vitamin D deficiency and treated with a higher dose of vitamin D to achieve a normal serum 25(OH)D level of at least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) [ [11](#B11-nutrients-12-02097)]. Emerging evidence suggests that the relationship between vitamin D status and IBD could be bidirectional. Data from two prospective Nurses' Health Studies showed that nurses living in lower latitudes had a consistently lower risk of developing IBD than those in higher latitudes [ [119](#B119-nutrients-12-02097)]. These observations were supported by a prospective cohort study of 72,719 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study showing that the highest quartile of predicted serum levels of 25(OH)D was associated with 46% reduced risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and 35% reduced risk of ulcerative colitis (UC) [ [120](#B120-nutrients-12-02097)]. [121](#B121-nutrients-12-02097), [122](#B122-nutrients-12-02097)]. CD is thought to be mainly driven by a TH1 response, while UC is associated with a TH2 response [ [122](#B122-nutrients-12-02097), [123](#B123-nutrients-12-02097)]. TH17 cells are also involved in the inflammatory response in both CD and UC [ [122](#B122-nutrients-12-02097), [124](#B124-nutrients-12-02097)]. Multiple studies reported that 1,25(OH)2D3 not only modulates T cell activity by promoting Treg and inhibiting TH1 and TH17 responses, but also maintains integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier by enhancing the expression of epithelial membrane junction proteins and intracellular pathogen recognition proteins, and inducing the production of antibacterial substances such as angiogenin, cathelicidin, and defensin by the intestinal epithelial [127](#B127-nutrients-12-02097)]. Moreover, recent pilot clinical trial showed that giving 380,000 IU of orally administered 25(OH)D supplementation to patients with CD increased the abundance of potential beneficial bacterial strains. [ [128](#B128-nutrients-12-02097)]. Although this observation remains to be confirmed by a larger clinical trial, a RCT of healthy adults who were vitamin D deficient and received either 600, 4000, or 10,000 IUs daily for 6 months had a similar dose-dependent improvement in their gut microbiota towards genera associated with increased expansion of Treg and lower inflammatory burden [ [129](#B129-nutrients-12-02097)]. Thus, improvement in the vitamin D status of patients with IBD is warranted not only for modulating the immune response but also improving their gut microbiota. 5.5. Rheumatoid Arthritis [130](#B130-nutrients-12-02097), [131](#B131-nutrients-12-02097)]. Merlino et al. [ [130](#B130-nutrients-12-02097)] showed in a prospective cohort study that women with highest tertile of vitamin D intake had a lower risk for developing RA by 33% compared with the lowest tertile. Some studies also reported the association between low serum 25(OH)D levels and higher disease activity in RA patients [ [131](#B131-nutrients-12-02097), [132](#B132-nutrients-12-02097), [133](#B133-nutrients-12-02097)]. Although the association could simply be explained the fact that these patients tend to have limited physical outdoor activities and sunlight exposure, vitamin D and its metabolites are believed to have a therapeutic activity against RA based on the immunologic activities of 1,25(OH)2D that suppress TH1 and TH17 responses and enhance Treg activity [ [134](#B134-nutrients-12-02097)]. Overexpression of TH1 and TH17 as well as dysfunctional Treg play a crucial role in triggering chronic synovial inflammation and symmetrical polyarthritis seen in RA [ [135](#B135-nutrients-12-02097), [136](#B136-nutrients-12-02097), [137](#B137-nutrients-12-02097)]. [138](#B138-nutrients-12-02097)] demonstrated in a RCT that giving 500 IUs of vitamin D3 daily along with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and calcium to RA patients lead to a significantly higher pain relief than those receiving DMARDs and calcium alone. Another study by Li et al. [ [139](#B139-nutrients-12-02097)] that randomized RA patients to receive 22-oxa-1,25(OH)2D3 or 1,25(OH)2D3 or placebo observed significantly decreased swollen joints and improved Health Assessment Questionnaire Disease Activity Index scores in those receiving 22-oxa-1,25(OH)2D and those receiving 1,25(OH)2D compared with the placebo group. However, the doses of 1,25(OH)2D3 and 22-oxa-1,25(OH)2D3 used in the study were reported to be 1250 \u00b5g per week, which was about 1000 times higher than the therapeutic dose of these compounds and would likely cause toxicity, thus indicating that there might be some type of error, possibly a decimal point error [ [139](#B139-nutrients-12-02097)]. Other studies that used vitamin D2 [ [140](#B140-nutrients-12-02097)], vitamin D3 [ [141](#B141-nutrients-12-02097), [142](#B142-nutrients-12-02097)], or 1(OH)D3 [ [143](#B143-nutrients-12-02097)] in the treatment arm failed to demonstrate the efficacy of the intervention. 5.6. Tuberculosis [13](#B13-nutrients-12-02097)]. Nowadays, tuberculosis continues to be a major public health problem that is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in many developing countries [ [144](#B144-nutrients-12-02097)]. Latent TB is the condition in which host immune response is able to form granuloma to engulf the mycobacterium in an attempt to control its proliferation. Once the granuloma fails to limit mycobacterial proliferation, patients become symptomatic and are diagnosed with active TB [ [145](#B145-nutrients-12-02097)]. Vitamin D plays an essential role in combating TB infection. Activated macrophages and monocytes in response to antigen exposure locally produce 1,25(OH)2D which then induces the production of cathelicidin, an antibacterial peptide responsible for killing infectious [1](#B1-nutrients-12-02097), [2](#B2-nutrients-12-02097), [5](#B5-nutrients-12-02097), [17](#B17-nutrients-12-02097)]. [146](#B146-nutrients-12-02097)]. A subsequent meta-analysis by the same group including data from seven studies showed significantly (48%) higher odds of developing TB in the vitamin D-deficient group [ [146](#B146-nutrients-12-02097)]. The association between vitamin D deficiency and TB is thought to be bidirectional [ [146](#B146-nutrients-12-02097), [147](#B147-nutrients-12-02097)]. In the presence of overt granulomatous inflammation, the increase in circulating 1,25(OH)2D produced by activated macrophages and monocytes results in up-regulation of the expression of CYP24A1 encoding the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase, which, in levels can be affected by anti-tuberculosis and concurrent medications such as antiretroviral drugs which are commonly used for treatment of comorbid HIV infection [ [2](#B2-nutrients-12-02097), [149](#B149-nutrients-12-02097)]. On the other hand, the association could be explained by the insufficient amount of 25(OH)D substrate required for the conversion into 1,25(OH)2D to stimulate granulomatous immune response against the invading organisms. [150](#B150-nutrients-12-02097)], culture conversion rate [ [151](#B151-nutrients-12-02097)], time to sputum culture conversion [ [152](#B152-nutrients-12-02097)], and improvement of clinical and radiographic findings [ [153](#B153-nutrients-12-02097)], while others did not [ [154](#B154-nutrients-12-02097), [155](#B155-nutrients-12-02097), [156](#B156-nutrients-12-02097), [157](#B157-nutrients-12-02097)]. 5.7. Sepsis and Critical Illness [158](#B158-nutrients-12-02097)]. Multiple observational studies reported the link between low level of serum 25(OH)D and the occurrence of sepsis, as well as increased morbidity, mortality, and prolonged length of stay in the ICU in septic and critically ill patients [ [159](#B159-nutrients-12-02097), [160](#B160-nutrients-12-02097)]. The relationship could be explained by the effects of 1,25(OH)2D which prevents overexpression of inflammatory cytokines and promotes anti-bacterial responses in innate immunity [ [1](#B1-nutrients-12-02097), [5](#B5-nutrients-12-02097), [161](#B161-nutrients-12-02097)]. In addition, vitamin D3 and its metabolites can exert non-genomic actions on endothelial cells to prevent vascular leakage, which theoretically could be life-saving in septic shock [ [37](#B37-nutrients-12-02097)]. It is also possible that low serum 25(OH)D levels in sepsis and critical illness could be caused by extravascular leakage of vitamin D-binding protein and increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase activity due to systemic inflammation [ [162](#B162-nutrients-12-02097), [163](#B163-nutrients-12-02097)]. [164](#B164-nutrients-12-02097), [165](#B165-nutrients-12-02097)]. Whereas, the same effect was not observed when giving intravenous 2 \u00b5g of 1,25(OH)2D3 to patients with severe sepsis or septic shock [ [166](#B166-nutrients-12-02097)]. A RCT gave enterally 540,000 IUs of vitamin D3 followed by monthly maintenance doses of 90,000 IU for 5 months to vitamin D-deficient, defined by serum 25(OH)D <20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), or placebo to 475 critically ill patients and observed a significant decrease in hospital mortality in a subgroup of 200 patients with severe vitamin D deficiency (serum In a post-hoc analysis after excluding patients who died or were discharged within 7 days after study inclusion, vitamin D supplementation was associated with a decrease in 28-day mortality in the remaining 410 patients (odds ratio 0.58; 95% CI: 0.35-0.97) [ [168](#B168-nutrients-12-02097)]. Another pilot study that gave a single dose of enteral 500,000 IUs or 250,000 IUs of vitamin D3 or placebo to 31 vitamin D-deficient mechanically ventilated ICU patients observed a decrease in hospital length of stay in the vitamin D groups compared to the placebo group [ [169](#B169-nutrients-12-02097)]. Nevertheless, in a larger clinical trial that gave a single dose of enteral 540,000 IUs of vitamin D3 or placebo to 1360 critically ill patients, the impact of vitamin D3 administration on mortality and other clinical outcomes was not observed [ [170](#B170-nutrients-12-02097)]. 5.8. Respiratory Viral Infection and COVID-19 [171](#B171-nutrients-12-02097)]. One of the proposed explanations is that the seasonal outbreak could be due to a seasonal variation in circulating levels of 25(OH)D which reaches the lowest levels in the winter [ [172](#B172-nutrients-12-02097)]. Several studies have supported this hypothesis as they reported the independent association between low level of serum 25(OH)D and incidence and severity of respiratory tract infection in children and adults [ [173](#B173-nutrients-12-02097), [174](#B174-nutrients-12-02097)]. A prospective cohort study in healthy adults living in New England showed a two-fold reduction in the risk of developing acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) in those with serum 25(OH)D levels of 38 ng/mL (95 nmol/L) or more [ [175](#B175-nutrients-12-02097)]. A case-control study in children aged less than 2 years reported that children requiring hospitalization for ARI had significantly 1.7-times higher odds of vitamin D deficiency as compared to those with mild ARI [ [174](#B174-nutrients-12-02097)]. This indicates the protective effects of sufficient vitamin D status against respiratory viral infection. Respiratory viruses enter the respiratory epithelium via the specific entry receptors where it causes cellular and tissue damages and triggers innate and adaptive immune responses, which then result in airway and systemic inflammation and, in severe cases, life-threatening sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome [ [176](#B176-nutrients-12-02097), [177](#B177-nutrients-12-02097)]. 1,25(OH)2D exerts anti-viral activities and modulates inflammatory response to viral infection by stimulating cathelicidin release, modulation of toll-like receptor expression and NK cells function, as well as suppressing overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines [ [178](#B178-nutrients-12-02097)]. A recent meta-analysis of 25 RCTs showed that supplementation of vitamin D2 or D3 can protect against the development of acute respiratory tract infection compared with placebo (odds ratio 0.88; 95% CI: and anti-viral effects, 1,25(OH)2D acts specifically as a modulator of the renin-angiotensin pathway and down-regulates the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression, which serves as the host cell receptor that mediates infection by SARS-CoV-2 [ [182](#B182-nutrients-12-02097)]. It is therefore proposed that supplementation of vitamin D can reduce the risk and severity of COVID-19 infection [ [183](#B183-nutrients-12-02097), [184](#B184-nutrients-12-02097)]. [185](#B185-nutrients-12-02097)]. Thus, patients presenting to the hospital with COVID-19 are likely to have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. It is therefore reasonable to institute as a standard of care to give at least one single dose of 50,000 of vitamin D to all COVID-19 patients as soon as possible after being hospitalized. For patients who are intubated and are being fed by a G-tube, they should be treated with a liquid form of vitamin D. Drisdol is a pediatric liquid vitamin D2 formulation that contains 8000 IUs per mL that can be given daily to these patients to treat vitamin D deficiency. 6. The Concept of Individual Responsiveness to Vitamin D [10](#B10-nutrients-12-02097)]. It has been shown that even 600 IUs of vitamin D daily can have a significant effect on gene expression in immune cells [ [186](#B186-nutrients-12-02097)]. [186](#B186-nutrients-12-02097), [187](#B187-nutrients-12-02097), [188](#B188-nutrients-12-02097)]. Carlberg et al. gave daily 3200 IUs of vitamin D3 to 71 prediabetic patients for 5 months and found robust changes in total gene expression in PBMCs only in about half of the subjects [ [187](#B187-nutrients-12-02097)]. In a more recent clinical trial by Shirvani et al. [ [186](#B186-nutrients-12-02097)], healthy adults who were vitamin D deficient and who received this same dose of vitamin D and raised their blood levels of 25(OH)D to the same degree showed marked differences in the level of expression of the same genes. This is dramatically illustrated in [Figure 5](#nutrients-12-02097-f005)which shows that 60% of the healthy vitamin D deficient adults who received 10,000 IUs daily for 6 months had a robust response in gene expression compared to the other 40% who had minimum to modest responses even though these subjects raised their blood levels of 25(OH)D in the same range of 60-90 ng/mL (150-225 nmol/L) [ [186](#B186-nutrients-12-02097)]. In addition, different patterns of serum metabolomic profile were also observed between the subjects with robust and minimum to modest responses in gene expression [ [186](#B186-nutrients-12-02097), [189](#B189-nutrients-12-02097)]. It is therefore possible that the effect of vitamin D supplementation on health outcomes at the populational level is diluted due to the possibility that some individuals might benefit from vitamin D differently from others. This may help explain the null results reported by some large RCTs aiming to investigate effects of vitamin D supplementation only tissues that express the megalin/cubilin complex such as the kidney are able to uptake DBP-bound-25(OH)D, while most tissues can utilize only the free level [ [197](#B197-nutrients-12-02097)]. Genetic polymorphisms in the vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) (GC) gene was shown to influence the ratio between circulating total and free 25(OH)D [ [197](#B197-nutrients-12-02097)]. Finally, it has been demonstrated that the variations of vitamin D responsive elements (VDRE) located in the promotor regions of VDR target genes could significantly affect the binding affinity to VDR-RXR complex, resulting in varying expression of the target gene in response to VDR signaling [ [112](#B112-nutrients-12-02097), [113](#B113-nutrients-12-02097), [198](#B198-nutrients-12-02097)]. Thus, it is possible that individuals carrying different polymorphisms of VDR or GC genes among others or VDRE in the target genes may have varying genomic responses to the comparable levels of total serum 25(OH)D and therefore might benefit from vitamin D differently. 7. Conclusions [4](#B4-nutrients-12-02097), [17](#B17-nutrients-12-02097), [18](#B18-nutrients-12-02097)]. Once a 1,25(OH)2D is produced, it acts in an autocrine and paracrine fashion to modulate the innate and adaptive immune systems. There is also some evidence that vitamin D itself may modulate immune function in a non-genomic manner by stabilizing endothelial membranes [ [36](#B36-nutrients-12-02097)]. Most of the evidence, to date, suggests that maintenance of a healthy vitamin D status is important for modulating the body's immune function. Low serum levels of 25(OH)D are associated with multiple immune-related diseases including autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases. There is less convincing evidence that vitamin D is an effective treatment strategy for autoimmune diseases and infectious diseases with a few exceptions documented in this review. Whether vitamin D therapy is effective as an adjunctive immunomodulatory agent for treatment of most diseases it is still controversial based on heterogeneous findings from the clinical trials. [12](#B12-nutrients-12-02097), [13](#B13-nutrients-12-02097)]. To maintain these blood levels, a person would require ingesting approximately 4000-6000 IUs daily. This would therefore maintain circulating levels of vitamin D in the range of 20-40 ng/mL (50-100 nmol/L). The observation that in vitro vitamin D3 was much more effective than either 25(OH)D3 or 1,25(OH)2D3 in stabilizing endothelial membranes thereby reducing inflammation may help explain the interesting clinical observations that extremely high doses of vitamin D have been effective in treating or at least reducing symptoms of some autoimmune disorders including psoriasis, vitiligo, and multiple sclerosis [ [37](#B37-nutrients-12-02097), [85](#B85-nutrients-12-02097)]. The with congenital autosomal recessive ichthyosis and epidermolytic ichthyosis had a dramatic improvement in their skin disease when treated with 60,000 IUs of vitamin D once a day for 10 days adds strength to the argument that vitamin D itself may have its own important role in the maintenance of good health [ [199](#B199-nutrients-12-02097)]. There are still open questions that need to be further investigated in order to take full advantage of the effect of vitamin D on the immune system for clinical practice. The bottom line is that there is no downside to increasing our intake of vitamin D to maintain serum 25(OH)D at at least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L), at 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L) to achieve optimal overall health benefits of vitamin D.
