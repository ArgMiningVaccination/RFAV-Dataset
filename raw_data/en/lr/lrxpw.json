We are a family of 6 and Suzanne picked us up at our resort for our private tour. We hiked to an amazing spot and were guided through a chakra mediation and awakening visualization. She then took us to another spot not frequented by tourists and filled us with a wealth of knowledge about the area and many other very interesting topics. She is a gifted soul with an authentic love of the land and an abundance of knowledge. We would highly recommend a tour with this company.

Me & my husband had an amazing spiritual tour experience with Kim. This was our first spiritual tour for 2. Kim arrived on time. She was very accommodating, knowledgable & applied some meditation, sound & energy healing. She considered our own pace as well as we had an opportunity to take in the beautiful & natural environment of the canyon. Would highly recommend to ask for Kim as your Spiritual Tour guide & Sedona Mystical Tours. Many thanks Kim.

Since we went in mid December, our original date was windy and chilly so she suggested either changing it if possible, or if not a different location than we had come up with. She took us to a few lovely sites that were off the beaten path. Our family members all had varying levels of skepticism and interests and she was able to work well with all of us. She gave us some background knowledge and lead us in a few meditations, one in particular I remembered as being especially powerful with the addition of sound bowls to enrich the experience. She had a beverage if we so desired, blankets, and pads to sit on if need be as well. It was a very memorable experience. (Our group was family with adult children--not young children or teens as the box below doesn't have the option of properly describing our group composition) Thank you for sharing your experience with Kim and the tour with Sedona Mystical Tours.
