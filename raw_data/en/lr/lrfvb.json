Zimmerman UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION Accreditation 7 The University of South Florida St. Petersburg and all colleges, departments and programs therein establish certain academic requirements that must be met before a degree is granted. These requirements concern such things as cu r- ricula and cou rses, majors and minors, and academic residence. Advisors, directors, department chairs, and deans are available to help the student understand and arrange to meet these requirements, but the student is responsible for fulfilling them. At the end of a stud ent's course of study, if requirements for graduation have not been satisfied, the degree will not be granted. For this reason, it is important for all students to acquaint themselves with all regulations and to remain currently informed throughout their c ollege careers and to be responsible for completing requirements. Courses, programs, and requirements described in the catalog may be suspended, deleted, restricted, supplemented, or changed in any other manner at any time at the sole discretion of the Uni versity and the USF Board of Trustees. What is accreditation? Accreditation is intended to assure stakeholders, students and the general public of the quality and integrity of higher education institutions and programs. Through a continuous improvement pro cess, accreditation also assures that the programs at the institutions are constantly advancing. These outcomes are achieved through rigorous internal and external review processes during which the institution is evaluated against a common set of standards . SACSCOC The University of South Florida St. Petersburg is regionally accredited for the excellence of its programs, faculty, and services to students by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award degrees at the baccalaureate and master's levels. Inquiries to the Commission should relate only to the accreditation status of the institution and not to general admission information. The Commission is to be contacted only if there is evidence that appears to support an institution's significant non -compliance with a requirement or standard. Contact the Commission on Colleges at: 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033 -4097 or call 404 -679-4500 for questions about the accreditation of the University of South Florid a. AACSB The College of Business is accredited by AACSB International - The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business in both business and accounting. AACSB International is the premier accrediting agency for bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs in business administration and accounting, and as such is the most widely -recognized and sought -after endorsement of business schools. Less than one -third of U.S. business school programs and only 15 percent of business school programs worl dwide meet the rigorous standards for AACSB accreditation. NCATE The College of Education is nationally accredited by National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), the national accrediting body for schools, colleges, and departments of e ducation authorized by the U.S. Department of Education. NCATE determines which schools, colleges, and departments of education meet rigorous national standards for preparing teachers and other school specialists for the classroom. ACEJMC The Department of Journalism and Media Studies (JMS) at USF St. Petersburg is one of 114 journalism programs n a- tionally accredited by the Accrediting Council for Education in Journalism and Mass Communications. ACEJMC is the national accrediting body for professional progr ams in journalism and mass communications. JMS, founded in 1991, was first accredited in both its undergraduate and graduate programs in 2004. Re -accreditation of both programs became official May 30, 2010 and will be in effect for seven years. About 25 pe rcent of all journalism and mass communication programs in the United States are fully accredited. A far smaller percentage of programs are accredited at both u n- dergraduate and master's levels.

To be considered for admission, freshman applicants must submit a USFSP Application for Admission, a non -refundable application fee of $30, an official high school transcript, official GED scores if applicable, SAT or ACT scores. Although USF St. Petersburg has minimum freshman admission requirements, meeting these minimum standards does not guarantee admiss ion.

These freshman applic ants are considered for admission by committee on the basis of other appropriate evidence of ability to do successful academic work at USF St. Petersburg.

In recalculating a GPA, USF St. Petersburg assigns additional weights to grades earned in Honors, Advanced International Certificate of Education, Advanced Placement, dual e n- rollment and International Baccalaureate courses. The University requires a diploma from a regionally accredited high school or a state -approved Genera l Education Development (GED) diploma. Students admitted under the Early Admission Programs are exempted from this r e- quirement.

Applicants with fewer than 60 transferable semester credits are considered lower -level transfers; upper -level transfers are those with 60 or more transferable semester credits (see below). Regardless of category, grade point averages (GPA) for purpose of admission will be computed based only on grades earned in courses that are acceptable for transfer credit and as calculated by USF St. Petersburg. 20Admissions and Related Matters USF St. Petersburg accepts transfer credits, without a course by course evaluation of the prior coursewor k, only from institutions that are accredited by one of the regional accrediting agencies/commissions recognized by USF St. P e- tersburg at the time the credits are earned. (See \"Evaluation of Transfer Credit\"). Courses approved for transfer by the Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS) from non -regionally accredited institutions may be considered for transfer credit. Credits earned at an institution that is currently in \"candidacy\" status will not be considered for transfer credit until such time as the aw arding institution receives full accreditation. For an applicant applying from a non -regionally accredited school, the admissions decision will be based on prior work at a regionally accredited institution or on the transferable work completed at a non -regionally accredited institution as approved by SCNS. If all post -secondary work is from a non -regionally accredited school, not including SCNS approved coursework, the evaluation will be based on the high school record and test scores and the applicant will be regarded as a freshman for purposes of admission. USF St. Petersburg reserves the right to evaluate specific courses and deny transfer credit. USF St. Petersburg does not award transfer credit that is determined to be occupational or vocational in nat ure except that work specifically a p- proved as part of the Bachelor of Science in Applied Science program or approved by the academic department of the student's major.

Students Entering the Florida College System Planning to Finish their Degrees at USF St. Petersburg High school graduates planning to start their college education at a Florida commu nity/state college should confer with the community/state college counselor and ask that their academic program be planned with the assistance of the USF St. Petersburg Undergraduate Catalog. This catalog explicitly describes the undergraduate program requ irements and Florida's common prerequisites that should be followed to ensure maximum ease of transfer into the students' u p- per-level programs on a par with their native USF St. Petersburg counterparts. Students Entering the Florida Community College System and Planning to Finish their Degrees in the State University System An articulation agreement, in effect since April 13, 1971, and later adopted by the Florida Legislature in statute form as Florida la w, governs an effective and orderly transfer of Florida community/state college students into the State University System (SUS). The agreement defines and establishes the Associate in Arts degree from a Florida public community/state college as the basis f or all articulation rights. Among these guarantees, the following are central to the transfer process: 1.A.A. graduates will be granted admission to a university within the SUS but not necessarily to the university or program of choice. 2.A.A. graduates wi ll have the same opportunity to enroll in a university limited access program as the native un i- versity student. 3.Upon transferring to a public university in the Florida SUS, A.A. graduates will be awarded at least 60 credit hours towards the baccalaureate degree, exclusive of occupational courses and basic required physical education courses. 4.Credits that are part of the A.A. degree earned through articulated acceleration mechanisms, such as Advanced International Certificate of Education, Advanced Place ment, dual enrollment, International Baccalaureate, early admission and credit by exam will be transferable to the state university. Such credit needs to be received directly from the credit -granting agency. 5.As participants in the Statewide Course Number ing System, receiving institutions must accept all courses taken at the transfer institution if the courses at each institution have the same prefix and the same last three digits of the course number. 22Admissions and Related Matters 6.The university catalog in effect the year the A.A. d egree student first enrolled at the community/state college will remain in effect for the student's entire program, provided the student maintains continuous enrollment as defined in that catalog. 7.Once a student has completed the general education core a nd this fact is noted on the transcript, regardless of whether or not an A.A. degree is awarded, no other state university or community college to which the student may transfer can require additional courses to the general education core. Included in thes e transfer guarantees is the right of appeal. Students may appeal to the university and to the Statewide Articulation Coordinating Committee Evaluation of Transfer Credit 1. The receipt and evaluation of transfer credit is the responsibility of the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions will evaluate the acceptability of total credits transferable to the University. The college of the studen t's major will assign equivalent courses in determining which courses are applicable toward a specific degree at the University. In some instances, exact course equivalents will also be determined by other colleges that offer the same or similar courses as part of their programs of study. Transfer students should be prepared with personal copies of their transcripts of all past course work to discuss advisement and placement with the appropriate academic advisor and should contact the college of their major soon after registration so that an official evaluation may be completed. 2. USF St. Petersburg reserves the right to deny credit for specific courses. USF St. Petersburg does not award transfer credit from institutions that it determines to be occupational or vocational in nature except for work that is sp e- cifically approved as part of the Bachelor of Science in Applied Science program or approved by the academic d e- partment of the student's major. 3. A course -by-course transfer credit evaluation will be done f or all out -of-state and private in -state A.A. degree holders. Effective Fall Quarter 1976, all courses from a Florida community or state college/university bearing the same State Common Course prefix and last three numbers as a USF St. Petersburg course ar e automatically tran s- ferred Transfer students may not be required to repeat these courses unless a college age -of-record policy is i n- volved. That same automatic transferability of credits applies to courses completed at non -regionally accredited instituti ons that have been specifically approved by the SCNS. Excluded are graduate courses, studio courses in art, internships, practica, and performing arts courses. 4. All undergraduate degree programs at USF St. Petersburg require a minimum of 48 hours of upper -level. This policy does not affect approved articulated programs based on the A.S. degree. For information regarding specific arti c- ulated A.S. degree programs, consult the USF St. Petersburg Office of Undergraduate Admissions. 5. Credit will not be awarded for GED tests. 6. Military service school courses will be evaluated with reference to the recommendation of the American Council of Education when official credentials have been presented. Such recommendation, however, is not binding upon the University. 7. For ROTC and military science courses taken after Fall Quarter 1975, the maximum credit will vary with each college. A student must confer with a college advisor to determine the acceptability for his/her major. ROTC and military science taken prior to Fal l 1975 are not acceptable for transfer credit. 8. A maximum of 45 semester hours of College Level Examination Program (subject and general examinations) credits can be accepted for transfer credit. 9. A maximum of 30 semester hours of extension, correspondence, and military service education credits can be applied toward a degree. 10. Grades earned in transferred courses are not computed in the student's USF St. Petersburg GPA except for the purposes of admission to limited access programs, the awarding of honors at graduation, and class ranking of ba c- calaureate students. 11. International credentials must be evaluated by an independent evaluation service with associated costs to be paid by the student. A list of independent evaluation services is available at http://www. usfsp.edu/admissions/ForeignTranscript.htm. 12. A continuously enrolled USF St. Petersburg degree -seeking student must obtain prior written approval from the college of the student's major in order for courses taken at other regionally -accredited institutions to be applied to the USF St. Petersburg degree program. *Accrediting Agencies/Commissions: New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Commission on Institutions of Higher Learning Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, Commissio n on Higher Education North Central Association of Colleges and Schools; Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Colleges Admissions and Related Matters 23 Western Association of Schools and Colleges, Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Accrediting Commi s- sion for Junior Colleges.

A list of approved independent evaluatio n services is available at http://www.usfsp.edu/admissions/ForeignTranscript.htm An international applicant (non -resident alien) must meet all admission requirements for the appropriate applicant category (freshman, undergraduate transfer, graduate). Other minimum requirements are as follows: 1. An international applicant whose native language is not English must present a minimum score of 213 (compu t- er-based test), 550 (paper -based test), or 79 (internet -based test) on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or 6.5 on the I -ELTS.

International applicants must be in good standing, having a 2.0 GPA as calculated by USF St. Pet ersburg at the last institution attended. 3. International applicants must submit the USF St. Petersburg Financial Statement substantiating availability of financial resources sufficient to cover all educational, maintenance, and personal expenses while atten ding USF St. Petersburg, without financial assistance from the University. 4. International applicants seeking admission to limited access undergraduate degree programs must also meet all requirements specified by the program. Transient Applicants An undergraduate transient student is one who comes to the University from another regionally accredited institution and wishes to take courses at USF St. Petersburg for one term only before returning to the parent i nstitution. Transient students may enroll at USF St. Petersburg as non -degree -seeking students. Transient students who wish to take USF St. Petersburg courses MUST HAVE PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL from their college academic advisor to receive credit for course s taken. The Transient Student/Cross Enrollment form should be used for this purpose. Non-Degree -Seeking Student Non-degree -seeking student enrollment is on a space -available basis and has been esta blished for those individuals who, while not desirous of earning a degree, would like to enroll in all levels of university courses. Teachers needing to take courses for certification purposes, high school students (with the permission of their respective guidance counselor), individuals desirous of taking courses for self -enrichment, and senior citizens are examples of those eligible to utilize this enrollment method. Former USF system undergraduate degree -seeking students may only enroll as non-degree -seeking students if they have completed their previous degree program or earned an equivalent degree at another institution. Should the latter be the case, an official transcript (reflecting the degree) from that institution must be sent to the Office of Admi ssions prior to registration. Individuals enrolling as non -degree -seeking students who plan to make formal application to the University may not apply more than 14 semester hours toward an undergraduate degree. Applicants denied admission to USF St. Peters burg as degree -seeking undergraduates may not enroll as non-degree -seeking students. Performance in courses taken in this category will not qualify an applicant for admission as a degree -seeking student. A non -degree -seeking student who has been dismissed from any USF system institution is not eligible for admission to USF St. Petersburg as a degree -seeking student at the undergraduate level. If extenuating circumstances contributed to the academic dismissal and the student meets other admissions requiremen ts, a request for waiver of this rule may be submitted to the Faculty Committee on Student Admissions. This rule does not apply to a student who has earned a degree from a regionally accredited institution subsequent to academic dismissal. Non-degree -seeki ng students are subject to the same academic policies as undergraduate degree -seeking students and must adhere to deadline dates published in the University Schedule of Classes. Non -degree -seeking students are not 24Admissions and Related Matters eligible to receive University honors or p articipate in the USF St. Petersburg/Florida Public Community College cross-registration program. Non-degree -seeking students also are not eligible to receive financial aid. Non -degree -seeking students are subject to the academic probation and dismissal po licy listed in this catalog. Potential non -degree -seeking students should also refer to the section of the catalog of the college(s) offering the course(s) of interest to them to determine whether any special college requirements exist that must be met pri or to enrolling. NOTE: Prior to registering for classes, all students born after 1956 are required to present documentation of proof of immunity to MEASLES (Rubeola) and RUBELLA (German Measles). It is further required that all students must present proof of immunity to Hepatitis B and Meningitis or decline immunization by signature. Students living in USF St. P e- tersburg Housing must be vaccinated against meningitis (no declination is permitted) . (See Immunization Policy on page 35.) Readmission (Former Students Returning) A former student returning (FSR) is any degree -seeking undergraduate student who has not earned his/her degree, has not been enrolled at USFSP in any of the last three terms, and wishes to re -enroll in the University. Former students returning must be readmitted to the University. In order to be considered for readmission, a former student should file a new application for admission with the Office of Undergraduate Admi ssions by the deadline indicated on the web site for the term of requested re -entry. A new application fee is required. Former College of Education majors must contact the College of Education Academic Advisor for additional readmission requirements. The r esidency affidavit must be completed and residency status will be r e- assessed. To be readmitted, a student must meet the following requirements: Have a USF St. Petersburg GPA of at least 2.0. FSRs with a USF St. Petersburg GPA below 2.0 may only return und er the terms and requirements of Academic Renewal I or Academic Renewal II.

If previously enrolled at USF St. Petersburg and academically dismissed at the end of the last term of enrollment, a student must file a petition with the Academic Regulations Committee for Academic Renewal I or II in conjunction with the application for re admission. Students who have attended one or more institutions since their last enrollment must request official transcripts of all work attempted at the other institution(s) be sent to the USF St. Petersburg's Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Acceptab ility of transfer credits toward completion of USF St. Petersburg degree programs will be determined by the college of the student's major. FSRs who have been readmitted are not required to participate in an orientation program. Students must meet with their academic advisor for course selection. Transient students and non -degree -seeking students are not considered FSRs. These students who wish to enter as degree -seeking students must file an application with the Office of Admissions and Outreach prior to t he deadline listed in the Academic Calendar for the requested term of entry. An application for admission must be submitted by all FSRs who have not been admitted to and enrolled in a USF St. Petersburg degree program within the last three terms. Former or continuing USF degree -seeking students must file another application for admission and pay the non-refundable $30 application fee when applying for a second degree program, another level of study or rea d- mission (see Readmission). A student may not work on a second undergraduate degree if he/she has been accepted into a graduate program.

Internal processes (such as auditions, portfolio reviews, and placement tests) utilized in the various departments for the sole purpose of determining a student's most appropriate area, level, or section placement in a program of study are not to be construed as examining mechanisms for the granting of credit. USF St. Petersburg Cross Enrollment - Transient Enrollment Cross Enrollment is approved only when coursework, critical to tracking for graduation, is not available at USFSP. Students submit for cross enrollment approval through Florida Virtual Campus at http://www.flvc.org. Students should consult with their aca demic advisor regarding residency requirements prior to requesting cross enrollment. Transient study is typically approved in the summer semester when students leave the USFSP service area but wish to continue in coursework toward their degree requirement s at another regionally accredited institution. One semester must be completed at USFSP prior to becoming a transient student. If the student wishes to take classes at a Florida public university, state, or community college, approval can be obtained thr ough Florida Virtual Campus at http://www.flvc.org. If the student does not plan to attend a Florida public university, state, or community college, the student should seek assistance with approval by scheduling an appointment with his/her academic adviso r. St u- dents should consult with their academic advisor regarding residency requirements prior to requesting transient e n- rollment. Please note: Cross enrollment and transient enrollment can affect eligibility for financial aid. Students seeking cross en rollment or transient enrollment are strongly encouraged to consult with the Office of Financial Aid regarding the potential impact. 26Admissions and Related Matters Please note: Credits hours taken under cross enrollment or transient enrollment will apply toward graduation only if prior approval was received from the student's USF St. Petersburg advisor.

Constitution; Fla. Board of Governors Regulations 7.003, 7.008, 7.015; Florida Residency For Tuition Purposes This notic e summarizes the provisions of Florida Statutes and University Policy/ Procedure concerning Florida residency for tuition purposes. In determining residency classification, students fall into one of two categories. They are either (1) independent st u- dents (students not claimed on parent's or legal guardian's federal income tax statement or whose parents do not provide 50% or more of their support) or (2) dependent students (students younger than 24 who are claimed as d e- pendents by parent or legal guardian o n federal income tax statement or whose parents provide 50% or more of their support). The law basically requires that a U.S. citizen/permanent resident alien/independent student or a dependent student's parent/legal guardian has established and maintained a LEGAL Florida residence for at least twelve (12) months before the first day of classes of the term for which Florida residency status is sought. The student who comes to Florida to enroll full -time in a Florida higher education institution as an out of state resident and continuously enrolls in a Florida institution will not normally meet the Florida residency requirement for in -state tuition regardless of the length of time enrolled. USF St. Petersburg is required to obtain documentation of 12 -months l egal residence before a student is classified as a Florida resident for tuition purposes. A student is required to request Florida residency in writing and submit supporting documents no later than the last day of classes prior to final examinations of the first semester attended for which classification is sought. The following is acceptable, non -conclusive evidence of the establishment of a legal residence in Florida. Two doc u- ments must be dated/issued at least 12 months before the first day of classes of the term for which Florida residency is sought. 1. Proof of purchase of permanent home in Florida. 2. Declaration of Domicile. 3. Florida's driver's license. 4. Florida voter's registration. 5. Florida vehicle registration. 6. Florida vehicle title. 7. Professional/occupational license in Florida. Admissions and Related Matt ers29 8. Florida incorporation or other evidence of legal residence in Florida. 9. Full-time, non -temporary employment in Florida. PLEASE NOTE: Tax returns and school/college records are NOT evidence of establishing a leg al Florida residence. Students who are dependent on out -of-state parents or who come to Florida for educational purposes are generally ineligible for reclassification to Florida status. In rare cases, the law allows some students (e.g., military, public sc hool teachers, etc.) who do not meet the basic requirements to be classified as Florida residents for tuition purposes. For more information about exceptional categories, contact the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Fees The levels of the Activity and Service Fee, the Health Fee, and the Athletic Fee are determined on each campus by a student fee committee appointed by the President of the University and the Student Government President. The committee includes USF St. P etersburg faculty and students with the majority of the committee being students. The fees may be reviewed on a yearly basis. The following fee schedule applies to all USF St. Petersburg students. Registration fees are assessed in accordance with Universit y Board of Trustees rules. All fees are subject to change without prior notice. The University will make every effort to advertise any such changes if they occur. 1.

To find out the amount of the total tuition due (the amount will not reflect any payments made on the account), students can bring a photo ID to the Office of the Registrar, located in the lobby of Bayboro Hall, and request a Registration Confirmation which will reflect total tuition and fe es. The student is responsible for paying fees in full by the appropriate due date stated in the particular term's Schedule of Classes. Failure to do so may result in cancellation of the student's registration. Fees paid by mail must be postmarked by the p ost office, not office metered, on or before the fifth day of the term. Checks are payable to University of South Florida (USF). To avoid a $100.00 late payment fee, in addition to a $100 late registration fee, all tuition fees must be paid or postmarked b y the U.S. Post Office, not office metered, by the fifth day of the term. The University cannot be responsible for lost or misdirected U.S. Postal Service mail. A student whose registration has been cancelled may request registration reinstatement through the fourth week of class for the academic term. Upon approval for r e- instatement, all fees and other debts owed to the University must be paid in full by cash, check, Mastercard, Discover, money order, or cashier's check before reinstatement will be effect ed. a.

Students can also find specific information for each student type (First Time in College, Transfer Student, Continuing Student, and Graduate Student) in the tabs at the to p of the page. For more detailed information about an individual student account, we encourage students to become very familiar with the \"Financial Aid\" tab in OASIS, our online student information system. Through OASIS, students can also view the status of their financi al aid, see any needed documents to complete their financial aid file, and see any awards offered. Prior to any payment of financial aid funds, students will need to complete the online Terms and Conditions annually. Keep in mind that most types of financi al aid require a minimum of half -time enrollment to disburse (6 Undergraduate Credit Hours for Undergraduate Students, and 5 Graduate Credit Hours for Graduate Students). Throughout the year, University Scholarships & Financial aid Services (USF System), a nd USF St. Petersburg Office of Financial Aid & Scholarships (Campus specific) communicates important information regarding financial aid via the official USF email address located under the \"Personal\" tab in OASIS. Therefore, it is extremely important tha t students ensure that they are reading these emails on a regular basis. APPLY : The first step in obtaining financial aid is filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at http://www.fafsa.gov . Be sure to list school code #009016 or #001 537, to ensure USFSP receives an electronic copy of your information. Students, and for dependent students, their parents as well, will need to apply for a Federal Pin number at http://www.pin.ed.gov , then complete and submit the FAFSA online at http://ww w.fafsa.gov PRIORITY FILING DATE by MARCH 1st EVERY YEAR : Since many programs are funded on a limited basis, it is an a d- vantage to apply early. Meeting the priority date allows a student the best opportunity to be considered for the maximum amounts and types of aid possible, since many programs are funded on a limited basis. Complete the FAFSA annually between January 1st and March 1st for the following academic year. Scholarships are another financial aid option for incoming students. See the \"Scholars hips\" section below. DEFERMENTS : Tuition, Housing and Meal Plan Deferments are automatically posted for qualified financial aid appl i- cations. Please note that tuition deferments, housing deferments and meal plan deferments all have different qual i- ficatio ns. A tuition deferment will not automatically qualify the student for a deferment of housing charges or meal plan charges. Be sure to check the \"My Requirements, Bookstore Authorizations, and Deferments \" link in the Financial Aid tab of OASIS PRIOR TO the start of classes (each term) to see if which deferments have been posted and to see the expiration date(s) for those deferment(s). Tuition deferments are provided to Degree -seeking, Financial Aid students enrolled at least half -time. A tuition d e- ferment p revents cancelation of registration for non -payment of fees and temporarily prevents assessment of the late payment fee. Financial aid is disbursed after drop/add, and applied against charges on the student account. If a refund results, a check or e -deposit is issued for any remaining leftover funds. Avoid paying a late payment fee by paying any remaining balance before the deferment deadline. Since tuition deferments prevent cancelation for non -payment, a student must officially withdraw from all classes by the end of drop/add week to be relieved of liability to pay and to ensure that tuition is not later paid by disbursed financial aid. Housing Deferments and Meal Plan Deferments are provided to students who qualify for Tuition Deferments, and who have accepted a specific amount of financial aid to ensure housing and/or meal plan contracts will be covered by incoming financial aid. Contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships each year for the amounts of accepted financial aid required to qualif y. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS for FINANCIAL AID STUDENTS : Federal regulations require all schools partic i- pating in Title IV federal financial aid programs to have a Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policy that confirms to the two requirements: Qua litative and Quantitative detailed on the financial aid web page: http://usfweb2.usf.edu/finaid/other/satisfactory_progress.aspx . These requirements apply to all students as one determinant of eligibility for financial aid. A student's satisfactory academi c progress is based on their entire academic record, at all schools attended, regardless of whether the student received financial aid. SAP is calculated each semester after grades have been posted to academic history by the re g- istrar. One week after the last day of final exams is a good time to check your status. If your SAP status is ineligible, you will not qualify for a tuition deferment and must pay by the payment deadline (end of drop/add, which is the fifth day of classes) or your registration will be canceled. FINANCIAL AID AND SCHOLARSHIPS Scholarships 33 WITHDRAWAL and FINANCIAL AID: If you withdraw from USFSP, either officially or unofficially, before the end of a semester, you may be required to repay all or a portion of the aid you received. For detailed information on the Federal Return of Title IV Funds requirement, go to http://usfweb2.usf.edu/finaid/withdraw.aspx Scholarships are administered by a number of different offices within the Unive rsity. Links to all scholarships can be found on the USF St. Petersburg Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships web page: http://www.usfsp.edu/finaid/ Select the tab at the top of the page that describes your student type, then scroll down to \"Scholarshi ps\". Admissions Scholarships Every First Time in College or Transfer Student who applies for admission to the University of South Florida St. P e- tersburg is automatically considered for admissions scholarships; no separate application is necessary. Financi al Aid Scholarships The USF St. Petersburg Office of Financial Aid also administers a variety of scholarships based on Academic Merit and Financial Need. The USF St. Petersburg Privately Funded Scholarship Application and deadlines, are available on our we b page at the beginning of each October. Departmental Scholarships and USF System Scholarships Also posted on the USFSP office of Financial Aid and Scholarships is the USF Searchable Scholarship database contains many scholarships across the USF system. A link to this database as well as the link to USF Foundation Scholarships can be found on the web page. USF St. Petersburg is approved for the education of veterans, eligible dependents, m embers of the selected reserve, and active -duty personnel who are eligible for benefits under public laws now in effect. All degree programs currently offered at USF St. Petersburg are approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Apply Students who may be eligible for benefits are urged to contact the Veteran Services Office, which is co -located within the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships in BAY 105. Once admitted, a student can complete the process to request Veterans Educational Benefits throu gh our online Clockworks system. The link is available on our Veterans Services web page: http://www.usfsp.edu/veterans To be eligible for full -time VA benefits at USF St. Petersburg, undergraduate students must enroll for 12 or more s e- mester hours, and graduate students must enroll for 9 or more semester hours each normal academic term. Additional information for obtaining education benefits can be found at http://www.usfsp.edu/finaid/veterans/education -benefits/ Out-of-State Waiver Honorably discharged veterans of the United States Armed Forces, United States Reserve Forces, or the National Guard who physically reside with in the state of Florida while enrolled at any USF campus can receive the C.W. Bill Young Tuition Waiver Program (Chapter 1009.26, Section 36, Subsection (12)(a) Florida Statutes) to waive the out -of-state fee portion of their tuition. Visit our USF System webpage for more information: http://www.usf.edu/student -affairs/veterans/programs/out -of-state-tuition -waiver.aspx Tuition Deferment The tuition deferment program for Veterans is set up through USF and the VA. Due to VA payments being delayed at times, a tuition deferment gives the student and the VA an extra 60 days past the start of the semester to pay for a student's tuition and fees. As long as the Clockwork Education Benefit Request is submitted by 4:50 pm on the last day of add/drop week (the first week of classes), a veteran or dependent of a veteran student will receive a tuition d e- ferment. SCHOLARSHIPS VETERANS SERVICES 34Academic Policies and Procedures The Office of Recor ds & Registration maintains the official academic records for all students and course registrations for currently enrolled students. Students are encouraged to contact the Office of Records & Registration about general questions concerning academic policie s and procedures of their current registration or academic record. Note: Each student must be aware of the University's academic policies and procedures insofar as they affect him/her. Academic Regulations and Information Semester System USF St. Petersburg operates on a semester system. Semesters begin in August and January with Summer Sessions b e- ginning in May and June. See Academic Calendar for appropriate dates. Academic Load The maximum load of an undergraduate student is 18 hours (Fall & Spring semesters) and 14 hours (Summer Term) unless approval is received from the dean or an authorized repres entative of the student's college. Students classified as Undecided must receive approval from the freshman/sophomore advisors in the Advising Center. In the Fall or Spring Semester 12 hours is the minimum load for a student to be considered as full -time. Full-time Undergraduate Student Definition - Summer Term Sessions \"A\" & \"B\" (6 weeks) For: Academic purposes - 6 hours or more each session For: Financial aid - Students must enroll for 12 hours (undergraduate) in any combination of Sessions \"A,\" \"B\", and \"C.\" Session \"C\" (10 weeks) For: Academic purposes - 9 hours or more For: Financial aid - Students must enroll for 12 hours (undergraduate) in any combination of Sessions \"A,\" \"B\", and \"C.\" Students receiving Veterans Administration benefits should confirm their Summer Term enrollment with the Veterans Coordinator in the Office of Financial Aid. Undergraduates may not enroll in 6000 -level cour ses or higher without approval of the college/department in which the course is offered. Availability of Courses USF St. Petersburg does not commit itself to offer all the courses, programs, and majors listed in this catalog unless there is sufficient demand to justify them. Some courses, for example, may be offered only in alternate semesters or years, or even less frequently if there is little demand. Excess Credit Hour Surcharge (USF Regulation 4.0102) In 2009, the Florida Legislature implemented Section 1009.286, Florida Statutes to encourage students to complete their baccalaureate degree as quickly and efficiently as possible. It established what is commonly referred to as an \"Excess Credit Hour Surcharge.\" The provisions of this section became effective for students who entered a Florida community college or a Florida state university for t he first time in the 2009 -2010 academic year and thereafter. The bill requires universities to add a surcharge to each credit hour taken in excess of the total hours calculated, based on a percentage defined in law. See the following table: Students en tering as FTIC SUS (First time in college State University System of Florida) or FTIC FCS (First time in college Florida College System) Fees to be Charged Prior to Fall 2009 NONE Fall 2009 -Summer 2011 50% for credits above 120% of total program hours Fall 2011 -Summer 2012 100% for credits above 115% of total program hours Fall 2012 and thereafter 100% for credits above 110% of total program hours ACADEMIC POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Academic Policies and Procedures 35 The surcharge is assessed only on the tuition portion of the semester hour cost, not on the fees. The number of total program hours required for the baccalaureate degree will be identified by the student's declared major. This is ty p- ically 120 semester hours, although, some programs have been approved to require more than 120 semester hours. Note: No in stitution may waive the excess hours surcharge as the language of the statute is mandatory. Transfer of Credit to USF St. Petersburg USF St. Petersburg will accept credits only from those institutions accredited by one of the accrediting age n- cies/commissions recognized by USF St. Petersburg. However, USF St. Petersburg reserves the right to deny credit for specific courses. The receipt and evaluation of total transfer credit are the responsibility of the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. The college of the student's major will determine which courses are applicable toward a specific degree and will assign equivalent courses (see Evalua tion of Transfer of Credit under Admissions and Related Matters). USF St. Petersburg subscribes fully to all of the provisions of the statewide Articulation Agreement (Rule 6A -10.024) and strongly recommends that students complete the Associate in Arts cer tificate before transferring. Special details for students who do not plan to complete the associate's certificate requirements are available from the Office of Records & Registration. Also, all transfer students should refer to other entries about undergr aduate transfers in the Admissions section of this catalog. Former Student Returning The Office of Admissions will evaluate the acceptability of transfer of credits taken at regionally -accredited insti tutions since last enrolled at a USF system institution. The college of the student's major will determine which courses are applicable for his/her major. In some instances, exact course equivalents will also be determined by other colleges that offer the same or similar course(s) as a part of their programs of study. Continuously Enrolled Degree -Seeking Student The Office of Admissions will determine the acceptability of transfer cr edits for continuing, degree -seeking students who take courses at regionally accredited institutions. However, PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL MUST BE OBTAINED from the student's academic advisor if these credits are to be applicable to the USF St. Petersburg degre e program. A prope r- ly-executed Transient Student form or Cross Enrollment form should be used for this purpose. Registration for Admitted Degree -Seeking Students Continuing deg ree-seeking students register by appointment for their next semester's courses during the preceding term, either by internet or in person.. Appointment times and instructions for all registration periods may be viewed on the USF system's OASIS on -line sche dule of classes for the appropriate semester. Prior to initial registration, all newly admitted undergraduate students are required to participate in an orientation and an academic advising session. All readmitted former undergraduate students returning ar e required to schedule an appointment with their academic advisor prior to registration for classes.Newly admitted students receive orientation information by calling (727) 873 -4181, advising information by calling (727) 873 -4511, or by visiting the advisi ng website at www.usfsp.edu/advising and registration information by calling (727) 873 -4645. Registered students may make schedule adjustments in the regular registration period during the preceding term or in the drop/add period during the first week of c lasses. (Deadline information is available in the Academic Calendar.) Degree -seeking students who do not register by the last business day prior to the first day of classes may late -register the first week of classes. A $100.00 late registration fee is cha rged during this week. (See the section on fees for additional information and the appropriate term's Schedule of Classes for dates.) To avoid cancellation of registration, fees are due and payable for all registered courses of record on the fifth day of c lasses (end of drop/add period). (See Academic Calendar for dates.) NOTE: A Mandatory Medical History Form is required for all students (regardless of age). According to Florida A d- ministrative Code Rule 6C -6.001(4), \"Each student accepted for admission sha ll, prior to registration submit on a form, provided by the institution, a medical history signed by the student.\" Immunization Policy (Policy Number 33 -002) 1. Introduction The University of South Florida St. Petersburg requires the following immunizations for registration and specific immunization in order to be eligible for on -campus housing. 2. Statement of Policy a. ALL STUDENTS MUST HAVE: MEASLES - proof of immunity i f born after 12/31/1956 RUBELLA - proof of immunity if born after 12/31/1956 36Academic Policies and Procedures HEPATITIS B - proof of immunity or signed waiver declining the vaccine MENINGITIS - proof of immunity or signed waiver declining the vaccine except as listed below b. IN ADDITION, STUDENTS ELECTING TO LIVE IN ON -CAMPUS HOUSING MUST HAVE: MENINGITIS - Medical documentation of immunization with Meningitis vaccine at age 16 or later. Declining by waiver of this vaccine is not acceptable for students in on -campus housi ng. No student will be assigned housing without proof of vaccine. c. MEDICAL HISTORY FORM (required for all students, regardless of age) All students must complete the USF Mandatory Immunization Health History Form http://www.shs.usf.edu/userfiles/files/M edical%20History%20Immunization%20Compliance.pdf d. PROOF OF IMMUNIZATION Proof of immunization that will be accepted for each disease is as follows: 1. MEASLES a. Medical documentation of immunization with TWO (2) doses of live measles virus vaccine on or after the first birthday and administered at least 28 days apart. Persons vaccinated with killed or an unknown vaccine prior to 1968 must be revaccinated. Persons born before 1957 may be considered to have had a natural infection and, therefore, do not need measles vaccine. The documented date of immunization for measles should indicate the day, month, and year. However, only month and year will suffice if the month and year indicate that the immunization was given at least 13 months after the month of birth OR b. Copy of laboratory serologic [IgG] evidence of measles immunity (lgG rubeloa titer) OR c. A written, dated statement signed by a physician on his or her stationery, that specifies the date seen, and states that the person has had an illness c haracterized by a generalized rash lasting three (3) or more days, a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit or greater, a cough, and conjunctivitis, and, in the physician's opinion, is diagnosed to have had the 10 day measles (rubeola). 2. RUBELLA a. Medical do cumentation of immunization with live rubella virus vaccine on or after the first birthday. The documented date of immunization for rubella should indicate the day, month, and year. However, only month and year will suffice if the month and year indicate t hat the immunization was given at least 13 months after the month of birth OR b. Copy of laboratory serologic evidence of rubella immunity (lgG rubella titer). 3. HEPATITIS B a. Medical documentation of immunization with 3 doses of Hepatitis B vaccine O R b.

In the event of a disease outbreak, student exempted from immunization requirements may be requested by the University, at the direction of the public health officials, to show titer proof of immunity, become immu nized, or remain off campus for the duration of the outbreak. All requests for exemptions will be reviewed to ensure consistency in application. f. CONSEQUENCES Students who fail to comply with the requirements as stated above will be blocked from registr ation and/or on-campus housing assignment. In specific circumstances, a temporary override may be granted, however, vaccination requirements must be completed before any further registration in subsequent terms will be permitted and current registration ma y be suspended if any deficiency in immunization status is identified. SUS Health Insurance Requirement for International Students The State University System of Florida requires that all international students have medical insurance in order to register for classes at USF. Academic Advising for Undergraduate S tudents USF St. Petersburg seeks to guide all students in selecting programs and courses best suited to their personal abilities, educational interests, and career objectives. Students who have been admitted to the University should meet regularly, Academic Policies and Procedures 37 by appo intment, with their Academic Adviser in the Academic Advising Center located in Davis Hall 134. This Center also serves as an initial point of contact for non -admitted, prospective, and/or non -degree seeking students who need i n- formation about the Universi ty's academic structure. All students are encouraged to establish an advising relationship with the Academic Advising Center and periodically visit their advisors to keep abreast of any policy, procedural, or curriculum changes that may affect them. In fac t, some colleges require advisor approval of student programs each semester. It is important for students to keep in mind that, although the University provides advising services to assist students with academic planning, it is each student's r e- sponsibilit y to see that all graduation requirements are met. Initial Advising and Registration It is necessary that all students meet with their academic advisors prior to first -class registration. The purpose of this initial contact is to provide the student with a thorough understanding of all outstanding degree requirements. Add i- tionally, the student should confirm that the advising unit has all necessary records to assure the student's proper progr ess toward education goals. Transfer students should bring an unofficial or student copy of their transcript(s) to this advising session. Declaration of Major Some first -year students enter the university undecided about their career plans and intended majors. Many of the more than 23 undergraduate majors at USF St. Petersburg allow students considerable options in their early course choices. Conversely, many other majors, and often the most popular majors, require completion of particular courses within the first two years. In fields, such as education, business, and graphic design, students must satisfy state mandated course prerequisites and complete specific general education courses during the first two years to be admitted to those major as juniors and to allow graduation on a timely basis. It clearly is advantageous for students to make early decisions about their majors to be on track and to remain on -track toward their degrees and to graduate in a ti mely manner. Students are urged to declare a major upon entry to the university. If they are unable to formally choose or declare a major or a pre -major they should follow the multi -semester inquiry -based (for undecided) curricula that best matches their i nterests. All students must be officially declared in a major or a pre -major before they complete 36 credits. Beginning Fall S e- mester 2005, Continuing students who will have completed 36 or more credits will not be allowed to register for further credit co ursework at the university until they have declared a major or pre -major. Transfer students must declare their majors upon entry to the university. Many resources are made available by the university to assist students in making career decisions and choosing their majors. Information about these resources is readily available fr om academic advisors. Advising for Limited Access Programs Students are cautioned that admission to the University does not imply admission to all the programs and courses offered by the in dividual colleges; this is especially true with respect to colleges with programs designated as limited -access. Colleges such as Business, Education, Mass Communications -Journalism and Media Studies, and the Program in Graphic Design have been designated a s limited -access and require completion of certain prerequisites before a student may declare a major. It is important that students check the college sections of the catalog for advising and admission requirements. Students planning to enter a limited -access program should be aware that their admission by the college may be denied or delayed and should be prepared with alternative plans of action. Course Attendance at First Class Meetin g This policy was implemented so that USF St. Petersburg may effectively utilize classroom space and to insure that all students have maximum opportunity to enroll in classes where demand exceeds availability of seats. Students are required to attend the f irst class meeting of undergraduate courses for which they registered. Names of students who register prior to the first day of the term are shown on the instructor's first class roll in Canvas for each course section. The first day class roll is used by instructors to drop students who do not attend the first day of class. In accordance with USF System policy (10 -006), instructors are required to take attendance on the first day of class and to drop students who do not attend the first day of class. Stud ents having extenuating circumstances beyond their control who are unable to attend the first class meeting must notify the instructor or the department prior to the first class meeting to request waiver of the first class attendance requirement. Distanc e learning students must log on to their course(s) during the first five (5) weekdays from the calendar start date of their online course(s). Students who are unable to log on due to circumstances beyond their control must notify the instructor(s) prior t o the calendar start date of the course to request waiver of the first day class attendance r e- quirement. Instructors may i nitiate course deletions (drops) after the add/drop period if the instructor discovers that the student has not attended the first or any subsequent class meeting. When dropped for non -attendance, the student may be removed from the class roll and will not earn any grade or credit for the course. 38Academic Policies and Procedures Although instructors are authorized to initiate this first -day drop, students are fundame ntally responsible for knowing their registration status. To avoid fee liability and academic penalty, the student is responsible for insuring that he/she has dropped or been dropped from all undesired courses by the end of the 5th day of classes. This policy is not applicable to courses in the following categories: Educational Outreach, Open University (TV), FEEDS Program, Community Experiential Learning (CEL), Cooperative Education Training, and courses that do not have reg u- larly scheduled meeting days /times (such as, directed reading or study, individual research, thesis, dissertation, i n- ternship, practicums, etc.). Students are responsible for dropping undesired courses in these categories by the 5th day of classes to avoid fee liability and academic penalty. Please note that the Registrar's Office does not add students to any courses. Students are required to add their courses via Oasis during the add/drop period. General Attendance Only officially re gistered students or students approved to audit a class are entitled to attend class. Students are r e- sponsible for being aware of all instructor -based and University issued attendance policies and the requirements of the registrar for enrollment, drop/add and fee liability. Students are responsible for completing the academic requirements of each class as defined by the instructor and as set forth in any class syllabus. An instructor may make attendance mandatory and may impose penalties, including failing a class, for excessive absences. It is university policy that student absences will be excused for military duty, jury duty, and religious days (as set forth in University policy 10 -045). E x- cused absences for other documented reasons may be allowed at the discretion of the instructor. Though excused, the student is responsible for completing all academic work, examinations, assignments and labs in a timely fashion. Procedures for Excused Absences and Make -up Work Students are expected to notify their instructors at the beginning of each academic term if they intend to be absent from a class or announced examination for the approved reason as noted above in accordance with this policy. In the event that a student is absent for one of these noted reasons on a day when the instructor collects work for purposes of grading (homework, quiz, etc.), the student shall be give n a reasonable opportunity to make up such work or shall not have that work averaged into the student's grade, at the discretion of the instructor. If excused for an absence, the student is responsible for completing all academic work, examinations, assign ments, and labs within a period of time and in a manner deemed appropriate by the instructor. The manner for accommodating excused absences appropriately is in the hands of the instructor, but a student who is absent for an excused reason should not be at a disadvantage when compared to other students. The approved reasons for excused absences apply even if a student in a course has the option of dropping an assignment grade (e.g., dropping the lowest quiz score). Excused absences for other reasons may be a llowed or declined entirely at the discretion of the instructor. Even if individual absences are excused, excessive absences may threaten a student's satisfactory completion of a course. Absences may count from the first class meeting, including for studen ts who hope to add the class after the first day. Jury Duty The University respects the need for all citizens to serve on a jury when called to duty. If a student serves as a juror, class absences will be considered excused when the student provides advance notice to the instructor, the instructor acknowledges the request, and the student provides written verification of jury selection and proof of service. It is important to note that excused absence only applies to physical presence, and not to the academic work missed. A student, though excused, is responsible for all academic work, examinations, assignments and labs if applicable. These issues are unique to University students and clearly may present undue hardship for a student to serve while enrolled in an active course of study. Any potential student juror may notify the court of conflicts or undue hardship and request an excuse from service. The individual student must make the decision as to whether jury servic e will present an undue hardship and then take the affirmative action to request to be excused from service and may need to provide a written explanation to the court. If a student does not request to be excused and is selected to serve, the student may mi ss a prolonged period of time resulting in the inability to complete the academic requirements of classes. Documented Medical Attention for Illness Students are excused for absences from documented illnesses that require medical attention. While students should not attend class with infectious conditions, even if medical attention is not sought, the decision to excuse absences from undocumented illnes ses is at the discretion of the individual instructor. Consideration should also be given to students whose dependent children experience serious illness. Extended illnesses may interfere with the satisfactory completion of courses, and in such cases a stu dent should drop the course by the posted \"drop without academic penalty\" deadline via OASIS. After the drop deadline, students may submit an Academic Regulations Committee (ARC) petition with proper Academic Policies and Procedures 39 documentation to drop a course or withdraw for medical r easons. Students may find additional information through their college ARC representative. Early Notification of Instructor Requirement for Unive rsity Sponsored Activities The University recognizes the importance of participation in University -sponsored activities such as music performances, athletic competition, and debate. It also recognizes that such participation may result in conflicts with sc heduled class times. It is the responsibility of participating students to provide a full list of anticipated conflicting days to instructo rs by the end of the first week of the term, and directors and advisors of University activity programs have an oblig ation to assist students with this task. Students are responsible for identifying potential absences specific to a particular class; a general schedule for a team or ensemble does not satisfy this requirement. Students should provide instructors with adden da and changes to scheduled conflicts (e.g., end -of-season tournaments, newly scheduled events, or rescheduled events) as soon as they are available. Directors and advisors of University activity programs should consult with pa r- ticipating students prior to registration to help them choose courses that do not have excessive anticipated conflicts Religious Days The university has an official Attendance Policy for the Observance of Religious Days (University policy 10-045) which provides that all students, faculty, and staff at the University have a right to expect that the University will reasonably accommodate their religious observances, practices and beliefs. Students are expected to attend classes and take exami nations as determined by the University. The University will, at the beginning of each academic term, provide written notice of the class schedule and formal examination periods. The university, through its faculty, will make every attempt to schedule requ ired classes and examinations in view of cu s- tomarily observed religious holidays of those religious groups or communities comprising the University's constituency. No student shall be compelled to attend class or sit for an examination at a day or time pro hibited by his or her religious belief. Students are expected to notify their instructors at the beginning of each academic term or as provided in the course syllabus if they intend to be absent for a class or announced examination, in accordance with this policy. Students absent for religious reasons will be given reasonable opportunities to make up any work missed in the event that a student is absent for religious reasons on a day when the instructor collects work for purposes of grading (homework, pop quiz, etc), the student shall be given a reasonable opportunity to make up such work or shall not have that work a v- eraged into the student's grade at the discretion of the instructor. Any student who believes that he or she has been treated unfairly with re gard to the above may seek review of a complaint through established University Academic Grievance Procedures (found in the Graduate and Undergraduate Catalogs) and those provided by the University's Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity. Schedule Changes PLEASE NOTE: Class days, times and room assignments are subject to change as late as the first day of classes. For updates, please check OASIS at http://www.usfsp.edu/portals/students.htm Click on \"Schedul e of Classes.\" Course Adds After a student has completed his/her registration on the date assigned, he/she may add courses on a space -available basis until the add deadline specified in the Academic Calendar. See the appropriate semester's University Sched ule of Classes for detailed instructions and dates. Course Drops A student may drop a course(s) during the drop/add period (first five days of classes) and no entry of the course(s) will appear on any permanent academic records. No tuition or fees will be assessed for course(s) dropped within that period. A student may withdraw from a course(s) between the second and tenth week of the semester (except for Summer sessions - see the Summer Schedule of Classes for dates). However, tuition and fees will be asse ssed for any course(s) withdrawn by the student after the first week. The student's academic record will reflect a \"W\" grade for any course(s) withdrawals between the second and tenth week of the semester. Under specific conditions, refund of tuition and f ees may be requested in writing from the Office of Purchasing and Financial Services. See \"Refund of Fees\" under Financial Information for complete details. Effective Fall 2011, all undergraduate students will be limited to a total of five course withdrawa ls while enrolled as a degree -seeking or non -degree seeking undergraduate student at USF. The five course withdrawals will be limited to three course withdrawals for students with less than or equal to 60 semester credit hours, and two course withdrawals for students with more than 60 semester credit hours. Only in extenuating circumstances will approval be granted for more than five course withdrawals. Appeals for additional course withdrawals due to extenuating circumstances must be submitted to the Acade mic Regulations Committee. Auditing Privileges and Fees A student who wishes to sit in on a class to review the course material may do so; however, the student is not allowed to take exams, earn grades, or receive credit. The student's status for that clas s is an audit and his/her presence in the classroom is as a listener. A student must register to audit courses during the late registration period. (No audit regi s- 40Academic Policies and Procedures trations are processed during the regular registration periods.) Fees for audit are the same as for full enrollment for credit except out -of-state tuition is not charged. See University Schedule of Classes for detailed instructions and dates. Cancelation Before First Class Day Students may cancel their registration by notifying the Office of Recor ds and Registration in writing prior to the first day of classes. If fees have already been paid, the student may request a full refund of fees from the Cashier's Office. Withdrawal A student may withdraw from the University without academic penalty during the first ten weeks of any term (except for Summer Sessions). He/she must submit a completed Withdrawal Form to the Office of Records and Registration. No entry is made on the academic record for withdrawals submitted during the first week of the term. Al l subsequent withdrawals (through the tenth week of classes in the Fall and Spring Semesters) are posted to the academic record with \"W\" grades assigned to the courses. Withdrawal deadlines for the Summer sessions are listed in the Academic Calendar and ar e published in the Schedule of Classes for the Summer Term. Students who withdraw may not continue to attend classes. Students who withdraw during the drop/add period as stated in the Academic Calendar may receive a full refund of fees. All refunds must be requested in writing from the Cashier's Office. No refund is allowed after this period except for specified reasons. See Refund of Fees under Financial Information for complete details. Repeat Course Surcharges Initiated by the Florida Legislature (H.B. 1545 of 1997) to reduce costs, all state universities must monitor unde r- graduate student progress and charge students the full cost of instruction for certain repeats of undergraduate courses. This policy became e ffective Fall 1997 and requires USF St. Petersburg to charge students a substantial per -credit -hour surcharge when they attempt a course three or more times at any USF system institution, unless the course is specifically designed to be repeated or is requ ired to be repeated by their major. Requirements to earn a passing or higher grade than previously earned in a course do not exempt the surcharge. Students will be required to pay the surcharge in addition to the appropriate in -state or out -of-state tuitio n rates. It is important to note that all attempts count, i n- cluding withdrawals after the first week of classes and courses with incomplete grades. The University may grant exceptions to this rule based on extenuating circumstances and financial hardship. However, the University may only approve one appeal per course. The exceptions included in the Statute are extenuating ci r- cumstances and financial hardship and are defined as follows: Extenuating circumstances are those circumstances determined by the Univ ersity to be exceptional and beyond the control of the student and may include but not be limited to serious illness, documented medical condition preventing completion; death of an immediate family member, involuntary call to active duty, university error , other emergency circumstances or extraordinary situations. The criteria used by the University for determining financial hardship should include, but not be limited to, qualification for federal need -based financial aid. Students with other documented fi nancial hardships may also be considered. The student must fill out a Fee Adjustment Request Form and indicate the request is for a waiver of the repeat course surcharge. He/she must also submit a statement that explains the request and provide all documen tation relating to it. The completed form with documentation should be submitted to the Office of Records & Registration for consideration. Transcript Information Transcripts of a student's USF St. Peter sburg academic record may be released only by authorization of the student online at http://usfonline.admin.usf.edu/ or in person by writing to the Office of the Registrar. By law, requests must include the student's identification number, the date and the student's signature or must be affected online via the student's 6 -digit self -assigned personal identification number (PIN), which is essentially the student's electronic si g- nature. In order for transcripts to be issued, the student must have no financial obligations to the University.

Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures The University is interested in each student making reasonable progress towards his/her educational goals and will aid each student through guidance and faculty advising. To make students aware of t heir academic progress, the University has enacted a system of grading and policies of Academic Probation and Academic Dismissal that indicates whether or not a student is showing sufficient progress toward meeting degree requirements. Notations of Grades, Academic Probation and Academic Dismissal are posted to the student's academic record. When a student is academically dismissed from the University and is ineligible to re -enroll, it may be in his/her best interest to re -evaluate his/her educational goals with an academic advisor. If the student's poor academic performance has resulted from extenuating circumstances or if after a period of time the student feels he/she has gained adequate maturity and motivation, he/she may petition the Academic Regulation s Committee for permission to re -enroll. See Academic Regulations Committee, for information on petitioning. Academic Dismissal may have additional implications for a student receiving financial aid. If required, a student may need to complete the Satisfac tory Progress for Financial Aid Recipients Petition. For more information, see http://usfweb2.usf.edu/finaid/other/satisfactory_progress.htm . Grading System Effective Fall Semester, 2000, USF St. Petersburg facu lty may use a plus/minus grading system to assign student grades. The use of the plus/minus grading system is at the discretion of the individual faculty member. A student's measure of academic achievement is recorded on the academic record based on the fo llowing grading system: Plus/Minus Grades B+ 3.33 B Good performance 3.00 B- C Average performance 2.00 C- 1.67 D+ D Poor performance 1.00 D- 0.67 F Failure 0.00 Other Grades E Course repeated, not included in GPA FF Failure/academic dishonesty I Incomplete IF Incomplete grade changed to Failure IU Incomplete grade changed to Unsatisfactory Records and Registration 47 M No grade submitted by instructor MF Missing grade changed to Failure MU Missing grade changed to Unsatisfactory N Audit S Satisfactory U Unsatisfactory W Withdrawal from course without penalty WC Withdrawal for extenuating circumstances Z Indicates continuing registration. Please note that the grade of C - will satisfy specified minimum requirements of the Gordon Rule courses and the common prerequisites unless otherwise specified in the Catalog. Grade Point Average The University uses the quality points listed above. The grade -point average (GPA) is computed by dividing the total number of quality points by the total hours attempted within the USF system. The total quality points are figured by multiplying the number of credits assigned to each course by the quality point value of the grade given. Credit hours for courses with grades of I, IU, M, MU, N, S, U, W, Z, and grades that are preceded by a \"E\" are subtracted from the total hours attempted before the GPA is calculated. Multiple attempts on courses designated as repeatable in the course catalog will provide for hours and quality points on each attempt to be appli ed to the student's grade point average. \"D\" and \"F\" grades established in USF system coursework not designated as repeatable for additional credit will be calculated into the student's GPA as many times as \"D's\" or \"F's\" are earned in the same course. If a student earns a grade of \"C -\" or higher in a course that may not be repeated for additional credit and earns a \"C -\" of higher on a subsequent enrollment the new grade is not computed into the student's GPA unless the student applies for and is eligible t o receive a grade forgiveness. \"I\" Grade Policy Incomplete (I) Definition: An Incomplete grade (\"I\") is exceptional and granted at the instructor's discretion only when students are unable to complete course requirements due to illness or other circumstances beyond their control. This applies to all gradable courses, including pass/fail (S/U). Students may only be eligible for an \"I\" when: A majority of the student 's work for a course is complete before the end of the semester (more than 50%). The work that has been completed is qualitatively satisfactory. The student requests consideration for an \"I\" grade as soon as possible but no later than the last day of fina ls week. The student must request consideration for an Incomplete grade and obtain an \"I\" Grade Contract from the instructor of record. Even though the student may meet the eligibility requirements for this grade, the course instructor retains the right t o make the final decision on granting a student's request for an Incomplete. The course instructor and student must complete and sign the \"I\" Grade Contract Form that describes the work to be completed, the date it is due, and the grade the student would earn factoring in a zero for all incomplete assig n- ments. The due date can be negotiated and extended by student/instructor as long as it does not exceed two semesters from the original date grades were due for that course for undergraduates and non -degre e-seeking students. The instructor must file a copy of the \"I\" Grade Contract in the department/college that offered the course and the Registrar's Office by the date grades are due. The instructor must not require students to either re -register for the course or audit the course in order to complete the \"I\" grade contract. Students may register to audit the course, with the instructor's approval, but cannot re -take the course for credit until the \"I\" grade is cleared. An \"I\" grade contract that is not co mpleted within the approved time frame (including summer semester) will revert to the original grade noted on the contract. \"I\" grades are not computed in the GPA, but the grade noted on the contract will be computed in the GPA, retroactive to the semeste r the course is taken, if the contract is not fulfilled by the specified date. \"M\" Grade Policy An \"M\" is automatically assigned as a default grade when the instructor does not submit a grade for a student. (U n- dergraduate rules also apply to non -degree -seeking students.) Unless a change of grade is submitted, the \"M\" grade will remain on the transcript and will not be computed in the student's GPA. S/U Grade System No-option Courses. Certain courses have been designated as S/U courses. The \"S\" and \"U\" grades are used to indicate the student's final grade. These S/U only courses are identified with (S/U only) after the course definition in this catalog. No grading syst em option is available to students or faculty in these courses. 48Records and Registration Option Courses. Any undergraduate course may be taken on an S/U basis by a student under the following conditions and restrictions: 1. Required courses in the major may not be taken on an S/U basis unless specifically designated 2. Courses supporting the student's major and state mandated common prerequisites may not be taken on an S/U basis. 3. Courses to satisfy 6A -10.30 (Gordon Rule) may no t be taken on an S/U basis. 4. Courses to satisfy USF St. Petersburg's B.A. foreign language requirement may not be taken on an S/U basis. 5. All elective courses for the major and all elective courses in the general education requirements, and all other free elective courses may be taken on an S/U basis except where: a. The certifying college restricts the number of courses that may be taken on an S/U basis in any one or all of the above areas or restricts the total number of S/U courses that c an be accepted for all of the above areas. b. The certifying college specifies that certain courses may not be taken on an S/U basis. c. The instructor of a course refuses to allow the course to be taken on an S/U basis. 6. Once of the Major Works and Major Issu es courses , if taken outside the student's major discipline(s) may be taken S/U credit with instructor consent. Mechanism for Assigning S/U Grades . The method by which a student receives an \"S\" or \"U\" grade in an option course will consist of the followin g: 1. A written agreement signed by both instructor and student shall be filed with the college offering the S/U course. . The college shall set the deadline (no later than the last day of classes for the term) for the student to decide if he/she wishes to take the course on an S/U basis. 2. The instructor shall assign final letter grades A, B, C, D, F, or I, but will transmit to the Registrar \"S\" or \"U\" consistent with the following: a. Letter grade, A, B, C, or C - shall be equivalent to a letter grade of \"S.\" b. Letter grades D or F shall be equivalent to a letter grade of \"U.\" \"S\" and \"U\" grades are not computed in the student's GPA. Grade Forgiveness Policy USF St. Petersburg's forgiveness policy permits an undergraduate to repeat a course and have the repeated grade computed in his/her GPA in place of the original grade, providing the repeat grade is posted as \"D -\" or higher (except ion - see Honors at Graduation)and is higher than the first grade. Normally, grade forgiveness may only be applied to a specific course that a student chooses to repeat. No course taken on the S/U grade basis may have the grade forgiveness applied. Under u nusual circumstances, a different but similar course may be used if the substitute course has been previously approved by the college dean and is on file in the Office of the Registrar. The grade forgiveness policy cannot apply to any course in which the g rade of \"FF\" has been recorded. Any undergraduate or non -degree -seeking student who wishes to implement grade forgiveness must: 1. Complete a \"Grade Forgiveness Request Form\" (available in the Office of the Registrar) for each course to be re- peated. 2. Adhere to the following conditions: a. A limitation of applying grade forgiveness to three USF system courses with no more than one repeat per course. b. With prior approval of the college dean, a course different from a course on the approved list may be substituted in the following cases: 1. The substitute course is a change in prefix, number, hours, or title, but not a substantive change in content from the original course. 2. The substitute course replaces a course no longer offered by the institution. c. The repeated course must be taken under the standard grading system (A -F) and the latest grade must be posted as \"D-\" or higher (grades of S/U are not permitted) and be higher than the first grade. d. All grades remain on the transcript. The original course grade will be annotated with \"E\" to indicate that the course has subsequently been repeated and the original grade is not computed in the GPA. e. Individual colleges may have furth er restrictions; therefore, the student should consult with his/her academic advisor. This policy is applicable to undergraduate and non -degree -seeking students only, and applies to 1000 -to-5000-level courses. Once students have been awarded a bachelor's d egree from USF St. Petersburg, they may not repeat a course and be forgiven the original grade, taken prior to graduation. The policy applies only to courses taken originally at any USF system and repeated at a USF system institution. Records and Registration 49 Good Standing USF St. Petersburg students will be considered in good standing if they are currently enrolled or eligible to return to USF St. Petersburg. Academic Record The student's aca demic record shall not be changed after the student has graduated. Academic Probation and Academic Dismissal for Undergraduate Students The first time an undergraduate student's USF grade point average (GPA) falls below a cumulative 2.00, the student will be placed on Academic Probation (AP). From the beginning of academic probation, the student must maintain at least a 2.00 GPA each term, and may not totally withdraw from any term without cause. Any student who withdraws from all classes after the fifth day of classes while on Academic Probation will be ac a- demically dismissed. Once on Academic Probation, academic advising prior to registra tion is mandatory until the student is removed from probationary status. The student may remain on Academic Probation indefinitely as long he/she maintains a GPA of 2.00 or greater each term. If at any time while on Academic Probation, the student's term G PA falls below a 2.00, the student will be academically dismissed from the University. Once academically dismissed, a student may only return to USFSP under the University's Academic Renewal Policies. If academically dismissed from USFSP, a student may not return to USFSP as a non -degree seeking student. The determination and notification of probationary status or academic dismissal will be made by the Registrar's Office on the student's academic record. A student who attends another college or university f ollowing academic dismissal will be classified as a transfer student and readmission will be based on the total record accumulated from all colleges and universities attended. If a student is academically dismissed or falls below a 2.0 0 GPA from USFSP and subsequently receives a BA/BS from another four -year institution, that student, when accepted to the University with the post -baccalaureate status, will have his/her academic record cleared. Academic Renewal USF St. Petersburg recognizes that not every student's academic record is flawless and that many times students get off to such a poor start that their future academic opportunities are limited. USF St. Petersburg can offer many of those students a second chance. The University's Academic Renewal policy allows students previously dismissed from the university, to renew their pursuit of baccalaureate degrees without the responsibility of having to overcome the entire burden of low grades a nd low grade - point-averages. To facilitate this opportunity, students who qualify for Academic Renewal may, with the approval of the Academic Regulations Committee, have portions of their academic record e x- cluded from calculation of their grade point aver ages (GPAs). The entire academic record, however, will continue to be reflected on their transcripts even though a selected portion will not be counted in their GPAs. Academic Renewal students are admitted with the same terms of academic probation and dism issal as other undergraduate students. Academic Renewal will only be applied to a student's academic record one time at USFSP. Academic Renewal I (ARI) - Students who have been academically dismissed or former students returning with a USF GPA below 2.00 m ay petition the Academic Regulations Committee to return to the University under AR -I if they have been away from the University for at least one academic semester A student will be considered for reinstatement to the University under Academic Renewal I if they complete all after completing all requirements for a Bachelor's degree, or an Associate of Arts degree or an Arts degree equivalent (including general education, and Gordon Rule requirements) at a two - or four -year college. Under the Academic Renewal I policy, students will return to the University with a 0.00 GPA and Academic Renewal I students will enter USF as juniors and their USF grade point average will be calculated from that point forward. While AR -I is best utilized by students who have earne d less than 60 credit hours, it is not restricted to those students. Students with more than 60 credit hours returning to the University under AR -I will likely incur excess hours and associated monetary penalty. In order to graduate following re -admission under AR -I, all degree requirements must be met, and a minimum of 30 credit hours must be taken in residence at USF. Students who are admitted under AR -I may be excluded from admission to limited access programs and will not be considered for University Ho nors at gra d- uation unless they meet the criteria using all grades earned. Academic Renewal II (ARII) - ARII is available to students who were academically dismissed and have 60 or more earned credits from USFSP or other institutions of higher education. T hese Students may be readmitted to the University under Academic Renewal II if they are able to provide convincing evidence indicating they are likely to be successful. Ge n- erally, such students will have been engaged in successful non -academic activities s uch as work or military service for at least one year or will have demonstrated recent academic success defined minimally as the completion of at least 12 semester hours with a GPA greater than or equal to 2.00, no grades below C, no course withdrawals, an d the CLAS requirement being met. In order to be considered for readmission under ARII, students must submit a request to the Academic Regulations Committee, who will, make a final decision regarding readmission. Following readmission under Academic Renewa l II, students will have their prior USF GPA set to 2.00. In order to graduate, students must have a cumulative GPA of 2.00 and at least 30 USFSP credit hours with grades of C or higher, including a minimum of 15 USF credits earned following readmission un der ARII. 50Records and Registration Students re -admitted under ARII may be excluded from admission to limited access programs. Further, students who exercise the Academic Renewal II policy will not be considered for University Honors at graduation unless they meet the criteria usin g all grades earned. College Policies for Academic Progress Colleges may determine and implement standards of academic progress for undergraduate students (majors in the college) in addit ion to those established by USF St. Petersburg. Students who do not meet the academic standards of progress set by their colleges will be placed on probation and may be disenrolled. The college dean is responsible for implementing standards of academic pro gress and for notifying students of their probationary or disenrollment status. Colleges may restrict the course selections and the numbers of hours a student may take that do not apply toward completion of degree requirements. Students who exceed this lim it may have part or all of their registration canceled. Colleges are responsible for publicizing and students are responsible for knowing their college's policies for academic progress. Class Standing A student' s class is determined by the number of credits he/she has earned without relation to his/her GPA. 0C Unclassified Non -degree -seeking students 1F Freshman 0 through 29 semester hours passed 2S Sophomore 30 through 59 semester hours passed 3J Junior 60 through 89 semester hours passed 4R Senior 90 or more semester hours passed; however, no baccalaureate degree earned here or elsewhere 5B Baccalaureate degree -holder working on a second undergraduate program or degree 6M Graduate student admitted to Master's Degree Program 6A Graduate student admitted to Specialist Degree Program 6C Graduate student Admitted to Candidacy 6D Graduate student admitted to a Doctoral Degree Program 7A-7D 1st-4th year professional program (M.D.) or post -doctoral status Change of Major All undergraduate students desiring to change their major should consult the Academic Advising Center. Administrative Holds A student may be placed on administrative hold by failure to meet obligations to the University. When a student is on administrative hold, he/she may not be allowed to register, receive a diploma, or receive a transcript. Settlement of financial accounts must be made at the University Cashier's Office. Each student placed on administrative hold should determine from the Office of the Registrar which office placed him/her in this status and clear the obligation with that respective office. Student Information Changes Notifications regarding changes of address, name, residency, and citizenship should be filed promptly with the Office of the Registrar. Midterm Grades (USF System Regulation 10 -504) It is the student's sole responsibility to be aware of their academic standing and grade status in all courses. In an a t- tempt to assist the student in evaluating his academic status mid -term, the University requires Instructors to submit midterm grades electronically for each student enrolled in 1000, 2000 and 3000* level courses. This is a courtesy to the student and failure of an instructor to post the mid -term grades will not be grounds for a student academic grievance nor will it be justification for a retroactive drop as the student is presumed to be aware of current academic status. Final Examinations Examinations in academic subjects are, for most courses, an integral part of the learning process and one part of a procedure for evaluating student performance and determining grades. USF St. Petersburg requires certain standards for the examination process in order to protect the academic integrity of courses and the best interests of both the student and the instructor. Testing in General: In each academic course, the student is expected to undergo a meaningful testing and evaluation that will reveal the student's intellectual growth in the subject matter covered or otherwise reflect the achievement of the course objectives. The instructor has the responsibility of maintaining a fair and impartial testing and examination procedure, has the right to define and structure the testing process, and shall not be restricted as to form, style or content of the examination. It is the policy of USF St. Petersburg that all students facing an examination (of any type) shall have equal advance notice Records and Registration 51 of the form and content of that examination. The University regards the routine use of all or part of the same formal examination for successive academic terms as unsound policy except when used with adequate safeguards such as a random selection of quest ions from a large pool. Comprehensive Final Examinations: The last 6 days of the Fall and Spring semesters shall be set aside for final exam i- nations, and any comprehensive final examination must be given during this designated period. If a segment examinat ion is given in lieu of a comprehensive examination, the segment examination must be given in the period designated during final examination week. The period of two hours shall be allotted for each final examination. If a student has a direct conflict of s cheduled examinations or has three or more examinations scheduled on the same day, the student may petition the appropriate instructor to reschedule one of the student's examinations. The final examination schedule shall be published in the same manner and place as the Schedule of Classes. Regional Chancellor's Scholar List Full-time USFSP undergraduate students who demonstrate superior academic achievement during one semester will be honored on a \"Regional Chancellor's Scholar List.\" To be eligible for the Regional Chancellor's Scholar List, a student must complete at least 12 USF credit hours of graded (A -F) courses, receive no incomplete grades during the semester and earn a 4.0 semester GPA Dean's List Full-time undergraduate students who demonstrate superior academic achievement during one semester will be honored on a \"Dean's List\". To be eligible for the Dean's List, a student must be in a 'pool ' (defined hereafter) and must complete 12 hours of graded (A -F) USF system courses with no incomplete grades during the semester. The Dean's List shall consist of the fewer of: 1) the upper 10% of the enrollment of the college or 2)students in the colleg e with a USF 3.5 GPA or above (ties at the 90th percentile will be included in the group). The dean of the college in which the student is majoring or the Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs for the undeclared students will recognize this academic honor. Students who believe they are eligible should contact their academic advisor. Academic Regulations Committee The USF St. Petersburg Academic Regulations Committee (ARC) is responsible for servin g as an undergraduate academic regulatory board for students who are designated as USF St. Petersburg students and wish to be exempted from an Undergraduate Academic Policy. The Committee is authorized to act both individually and collectively in respondi ng to student petitions. Since any student has the right to appeal academic decisions, there is also an Academic Appeal Board to hear and adjudicate appeals to ARC decisions. The ARC Appeal Board is the final point of petition for a student - there is no higher authority. Students should contact their Academic Advisor if considering an ARC Petition. Student Academic Grievance Procedures I. Introduction (Purpose and Intent) The purpose o f these procedures is to provide all undergraduate and graduate students taking courses within the University of South Florida system an opportunity for objective review of facts and events pertinent to the cause of the academic grievance. Such review will be accomplished in a collegial, non -judicial atmosphere rather than an adversarial one, and shall allow the parties involved to participate. All parties will be expected to act in a profe s- sional and civil manner. The procedures that follow are designed to ensure objective and fair treatment of both students and instructors. These guidelines are meant to govern all colleges, however, as individual USF institutions and the appropriate co l- leges may have different leve ls of authority or titles, each student must obtain the specific designations used by each entity for levels of authority and titles in this process. In the case of grade appeals, the University reserves the right to change a student's grade if it is deter mined at the conclusion of the grievance process that the grade given was incorrect. In such circumstances, the Dean or Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs may file an administrative grade change. The term \"incorrect\" means the assigned grade was based on something other than performance in the course, or that the assignment of the grade was not consistent with the criteria for awarding of grades as described in the course syllabus or other materials distributed to the student. In the case of all other aca demic grievances, the University reserves the right to determine the final outcome based on the procedures detailed herein. In the case of Academic Integrity (USF System Regulation 3.027) violations, these Student Academic Grievance Procedures apply and in clude an Academic Integrity Review Process at the College Level as described in section III below. II. Terms and Guidelines 52Records and Registration An \"academic grievance\" is a claim that a specific academic decision or action that affects that student's academic record or stat us has violated published policies and procedures, or has been applied to the grievant in a manner different from that used for other students. Grievances may relate to such decisions as the assignment of a grade seen by the student as incorrect or the dis missal or failure of a student for his or her action(s). Academic grievances will not deal with general student complaints. \"Instructor\" shall mean any classroom instructor, thesis/dissertation/directed study supervisor, committee member or chair, or couns elor/advisor who interacts with the student in an academic environment. \"Department Chair/Director\" shall mean the academic head of a college department or the director of a program \u2014or in all cases a \"Department's designee\" appointed to handle academic gri evances. \"Dean\" shall mean a College Dean or the equivalent as indicated \u2014or in all cases a \"Dean's designee\" appointed to handle academic grievances for the unit. \"Time\" shall mean \"academic time,\" that is, periods when University classes are in session. T he person vested with authority at the appropriate level may extend any of the time periods contained herein for good cause. Any e x- tensions must be communicated in writing to all parties. For the purposes of this policy, each step shall be afforded three ( 3) weeks as a standard time limit. When a department considers a grievance according to published d e- partmental procedures approved by the College Dean and Regional Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, as pert i- nent, the time line specified in this academic unit's procedures will govern the process and no additional notice of time extension is needed. \"Written communication\" shall mean communication by hard copy to the recipient's address of record. The \"burden of proof\" shall be upon the student such that t he student challenging the decision, action or grade assigned has the burden of supplying evidence that proves that the instructor's decision was incorrect, in all cases except alleged violations of academic integrity. In cases where the issue is academic integrity, the burden of proof shall be upon the instructor. In considering grievances, decisions will be based on the preponderance of the ev i- dence. Neither party shall be entitled to bring \"legal representation\" to any actual grievance proceeding as this is an internal review of an academic decision. As some Colleges may use different titles, the next level that applies to that College shall be substituted. III. Statement of Policy A. Resolution at the Department Level 1. The student shall first make a reasonable effort to resolve his or her grievance with the instructor co n- cerned, with the date of the incident triggering the start of the process (i.e. the issuance of a grade; the receipt of an assignment) and the instructor shall accommodate a reasonab le request to discuss and a t- tempt to resolve this issue. 2. If the situation cannot be resolved or the instructor is not available, the student shall file a notification letter within three weeks of the triggering incident to the department Chairperson/Di rector. This shall be a concise written statement of particulars and must include information pertaining to how, in the student's opinion, University policies or procedures were violated. The department Chairperson/Director shall pr o- vide a copy of this sta tement to the instructor. 3. The department Chairperson/Director shall discuss the statement jointly or individually with the student and the instructor to see if the grievance can be resolved. If the department maintains its own grievance procedure,* it should be applied at this point. If the grievance can be resolved, the Chairperson/Director shall provide a statement to that effect to the student and the instructor with a copy to the College Dean. *Departments may develop their own formal procedures for considering grievances. Such procedures must be consi d- ered and approved by the College Dean and the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, and published on the Depar t- ment's web site. When such procedu res exist, the Department's examination of the grievance will unfold as specified in the procedures. If the Departmental process upholds the student's grievance, the Department Chair will work with the College, the student and the instructor to remedy the situation. If the Department does not uphold the grievance, the Chair will report the fact to the Dean. The student may, in such cases, request the College Level review as outlined in these University procedures. 4. If the grievance cannot be resolved, th e department Chair/Director shall notify both the student and the instructor, informing the student of his/her right to file a written request within three weeks to advance the grievance to the College Level. The instructor may file a written response to t he grievance petition. Upon receipt of the student's request to move the process to the College Level and the instructor's r e- sponse to the grievance (if provided), the Chairperson/Director shall immediately notify the College Dean of the grievance, providi ng copies of the student's initiating grievance statement, any instructor's written response to the grievance, and the written request from the student to have the process advanced to the College Level (which may include additional responsive or final stat ements by the student). Should the student not file a written request to move the grievance to the College Level within the prescribed time, the grievance will end. Records and Registration 53 If the grievance concerns the Chairperson/Director or other officials of the department, t he student has a right to bypass the departmental process and proceed directly to the College Level. B. Resolution at the College Level 1. Upon receipt of the grievance, the College Dean shall either determine that the matter is not an academic grievance and dismiss it or within three weeks shall establish an Academic Grievance Committee. The membership of the Committee shall be constituted as follows: a. Three (3) faculty members and two (2) students (undergraduate or graduate as appropriate to the case ) shall be selected from the college by the Dean. b. Wherever practical, the Committee shall not include members of the faculty or students of the d e- partment directly involved with the grievance, or faculty or students of the student's major depar t- ment. T he student or faculty may address the committee. However, if requested by the committee; faculty or students from the department involved with the grievance or from the student's major department may provide expert or other relevant testimony in the procee dings. 2. The Committee will operate in the following manner: a. The Committee Chairperson will be appointed by the College Dean from among the three faculty members appointed to the Committee. b. The Committee Chairperson shall be responsible for sched uling meetings, overseeing the deliberations of the committee and ensuring that full and fair consideration is provided to all parties. The Committee Chairperson shall vote on committee decisions only when required to break a tie. c. In Committee reviews involving Academic Integrity, the following Academic Integrity Review Process shall be followed: 1. The Committee Chairperson shall notify the student and instructor of the date and time of the meeting. 2. The student and instructor may submit a list of questions to the Committee Chairperson to be answered by the student and instructor. If submitted, the questions will be disseminated by the Committee Chairperson and the Committee Chairperson will ensure that the questions are a n- swered in writing and subm itted for review by the Committee, student, and instructor before the initial meeting. 3. The student or instructor may request to attend a Committee meeting as designated by the Chairperson to present any final statement to the Committee and either may b e present during the other's final statement. Neither the student nor instructor may be present during the deliber a- tions. 4. The student or instructor may bring an advisor (not to act as legal counsel or to participate in the meetings) to the meeting. 5. Students shall be permitted to remain in the course or program during the Academic Integrity Review Process. However, if the student is in a clinical or internship setting, the student may be removed from such setting until the issue of Academic Integrity is resolved. In such cases, the program will attempt to identify an alternative educational option to the clinical or internship to enable the student to continue progressing in the program. d. All deliberations shall be in private and held confidential by all members of the Committee. The recommendation of the Committee shall be based on the factual evidence presented to it. e. Within three weeks of the Committee appointment, the Committee Chairperson shall deliver in writing to the student, instructor, department Chairperson/Director or Program Director, and College Dean a report of the findings and a recommended resolution. f. Within three weeks of receipt of the Committee recommendation, the College Dean shall provide a decision in writing to all par ties. g. The student or the instructor may appeal the decision of the College Dean to the University Level only if the decision of the College Dean is contrary to the recommendation of the Committee or if there is a procedural violation of these Student A cademic Grievance Procedures. Such an appeal must be made in writing to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs within three weeks of receipt of the decision from the College Dean. Otherwise, the College Dean's decision is final and not subject to further appeal within the University. C. Resolution at the University Level The Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs at USF St. Petersburg may delegate authority to a designated ac a- demic administrator at USF St. Petersburg to hear the appeal at the University le vel. 1. The student or the instructor may appeal at the University Level within three weeks of the receipt of a decision made at the College Level, when (1) the decision by a College Dean is contrary to the reco m- mendation of a college Grievance Committee, or (2) there is cause to think a procedural violation of these University Academic Grievance Procedures has been made. Within three weeks of receipt of the appeal to the decision, the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs in consultation with the Faculty S enate and the Student Senate, shall appoint an Appeals Committee consisting of three faculty members drawn from the 54Records and Registration University Undergraduate Council or Graduate Council (as appropriate), and two students, undergraduate or graduate (as appropriate). 2. Th e structure, functions and operating procedures of the Appeals Committee will be the same as those of the College Committee (i.e. chaired by one of the appointed faculty members appointed by the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs who will not vote except in the case of a tie, having no representation from either party's respective departments, developing a recommendation to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. 3. Within three weeks of the appointment, the Committee Chairperson shall deliver in writing to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs a report of the findings of the Committee and a recommended resolution. 4. Within three weeks of receipt of the Comm ittee recommendation, the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs shall provide a decision in writing to all parties. 5. If the Vice Chancellor's decision is that a grade change is merited, the Vice Chancellor shall initiate the grade change on the authorit y of the Provost and so inform all parties. In all academic grievance appeals, the Vice Chancellor's decision is final and not subject to further appeal within the University. These procedures shall take effect commencing (February 10, 2009) and shall supe rsede all other academic grievance procedures currently in effect. * Departments may develop their own formal procedures for considering grievances. Such procedures must be co n- sidered and approved by the College Dean and the Vice Chancellor for Academic Af fairs, and published on the D e- partment's web site. When such procedures exist, the Department's examination of the grievance will unfold as specified in the procedures. If the Departmental process upholds the student's grievance, the Department Chair will work with the College, the student and the instructor to remedy the situation. If the Department does not uphold the grievance, the Chair will report the fact to the Dean. The student may, in such cases, request the College Level review as outlined in thes e university procedures. Procedures for Alleged Academic Dishonesty or Disruption of Academic Process Alleged violations of academic integrity or all eged disruptions of academic process will be handled initially by the instructor, who will discuss the incident with the student. It must be noted that the Faculty Senate considers the tr a- ditional relationship between student and faculty member as the prim ary means of settling disputes that may arise. If the instructor observes the alleged dishonesty occurring during an examination, he/she should, with discretion, notify the student of the fact before the student leaves the examination. In all cases, the in structor must attempt to schedule a meeting with the student to discuss the alleged dishonesty or disruptions. After the discussion, if the student and instructor have reached a mutual agreement as to the solution, the instructor shall file a statement wit h the College Dean, responsible for the course outlining the facts of the incident and the agreed -upon solution signed by both the instructor and student. A copy of this statement shall be given to the student. If no solution is reached, the matter should be referred to the College Dean, for attempt at resolution. Integrity of Students 1. Fundamental principles: Academic integrity is the foundation of the University of South Florida system's (University/ USF) commitment to the academic honesty and personal integrity of its University community. Academic integrity is grounded in certain fundamental values, which include honesty, respect and fairness. Broadly defined, academic honesty is the co m- pletion of al l academic endeavors and claims of scholarly knowledge as representative of one's own efforts. Knowledge and maintenance of the academic standards of honesty and integrity as set forth by the University are the responsibility of the entire academic communi ty, including the instructional faculty, staff and students. 2. General Policies: The following policies and procedures apply to all students, instructional faculty and staff who participate in a d- ministration of academic classes, programs and research at the University of South Florida St. Petersburg. This regulation asserts fairness in that it requires notice to any student accused of a violation of academic integrity and provides a directive for discussion between the instructor and student to seek a fa ir and equitable resolution. If a fair resolution is not accomplished in this discussion, this regulation allows the student continued rights of due process under the academic grievance procedures based upon the preponderance of the evidence. The policies described below are the only policies and procedures that govern violations of academic integrity at the University and s u- persede any previous policies or regulations. 3. Violations of Academic Integrity: Undergraduate and Graduate Behaviors that violate academic integrity are listed below and are not intended to be all inclusive. (a) Cheating Definition: Cheating is using or attempting to use materials, information, notes, study aids, or other assistance in any type of examination or evaluation which have not been authorized by the instructor. Records and Registration 55 Clarification: 1. Students completing any type of examination or evaluation are prohibited from looking at or transmitting materials to an other student (including electronic reproductions and transmissions) and from using external aids of any sort (e.g. books, notes, calculators, photographic images or conversation with others) unless the instructor has indicated specifically in advance that this will be allowed. 2. Students may not take examinations or evaluations in the place of other persons. Students may not allow other persons to take examinations or evaluations in their places. 3. Students may not acquire unauthorized information abou t an examination or evaluation and may not use any such information improperly acquired by others. 4. Instructors, programs and departments may establish, with the approval of the colleges, additional rules for exam environments and behavior. Such rules m ust be announced in advance in a course syllabus or other a d- vance written notice to students. (b) Plagiarism Definition : Plagiarism is intentionally or carelessly presenting the work of another as one's own. It includes submitting an assignment purportin g to be the student's original work which has wholly or in part been created by another person. It also includes the presentation of the work, ideas, representations, or words of another person without customary and proper acknowledgement of sources. Stude nts must consult with their instructors for clarification in any situation in which the need for documentation is an issue, and will have plagiarized in any situation in which their work is not properly documented. Clarification: 1. Every direct quotation must be identified by quotation marks or appropriate indentation and must be properly acknowledged by parenthetical citation in the text or in a footnote or endnote. 2. When material from another source is paraphrased or summarize d in whole or in part in one's own words, that source must be acknowledged in a footnote or endnote, or by parenthetical citation in the text. 3. Information gained in reading or research that is not common professional knowledge must be acknowledged in a parenthetical citation in the text or in a footnote or endnote. 4. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, the use of papers, reports, projects, and other such materials prepared by someone else. (c) Fabrication, Forgery and Obstruction Definitio ns: Fabrication is the use of invented, counterfeited, altered or forged information in assignments of any type i n- cluding those activities done in conjunction with academic courses that require students to be involved in out-of-classroom experiences. Forgery is the imitating or counterfeiting of images, documents, signatures, and the like. Obstruction is any behavior that limits the academic opportunities of other students by improperly impeding their work or their access to educational resources. Clarification: 1. Fabricated or forged information may not be used in any laboratory experiment, report of research, or academic exercise. Invention for artistic purposes is legitimate under circumstances explicitly authorized by an i n- structor. 2. Studen ts may not furnish to instructors fabricated or forged explanations of absences or of other aspects of their performance and behavior. 3. Students may not furnish, or attempt to furnish, fabricated, forged or misleading information to University officials on University records, or on records of agencies in which students are fulfilling academic assignments. 4. Students may not steal, change, or destroy another student's work. Students may not impede the work of others by the theft, defacement, mutilation or obstruction of resources so as to deprive others of their use. 5.

Clarification: 1. Students may not normally submit any academic assig nment, work, or endeavor in more than one course for academic credit of any sort. This will apply to submissions of the same or substantially the same work in the same semester or in different semesters. 2. Students may not normally submit the same or substantially the same work in two different classes for academic credit even if the work is being graded on different bases in the separate courses (e.g. graded for research effort and content versus gramma r and spelling). 3. Students may resubmit a prior academic endeavor if there is substantial new work, research, or other appr o- priate additional effort. The student shall disclose the use of the prior work to the instructor and receive the instructor's per mission to use it PRIOR to the submission of the current endeavor. 4. Students may submit the same or substantially the same work in two or more courses with the prior written permission of all faculty involved. Instructors will specify the expected acade mic effort applicable to their courses and the overall endeavor shall reflect the same or additional academic effort as if separate assignments were submitted in each course. Failure by the student to obtain the written permission of each instructor shall be considered a multiple submission. (e) Complicity Definition: Complicity is assisting or attempting to assist another person in any act of academic dishonesty. Clarification : 1. Students may not allow other students to copy from their papers during an y type of examination. 2. Students may not assist other students in acts of academic dishonesty by providing material of any kind that one may have reason to believe will be misrepresented to an instructor or other University official. 3. Students may no t provide substantive information about test questions or the material to be tested before a scheduled examination unless they have been specifically authorized to do so by the course instructor. This does not apply to examinations that have been administe red and returned to students in previous semesters. (f) Misconduct in Research and Creative Endeavors Definition: Misconduct in research is serious deviation from the accepted professional practices within a discipline or from the policies of the Univers ity in carrying out, reporting, or exhibiting the results of research or in publishing, exhibiting, or performing creative endeavors. It includes the fabrication or falsification of data, plagiarism, and scientific or creative misrepresentation.

Clarification: Students may not violate state or federal laws concernin g the fair use of copies. (4) Violations and Sanctions for Undergraduate Students:1 Violations for undergraduate students at the University of South Florida St. Petersburg are classified into four levels according to the nature of the infraction. For each level of violation a corresponding set of sanctions is reco m- mended, however, specific academic programs may include additional and different sanctions. These sanctions are intended as general guidelines for the academic community with examples cited below for each level of violation. These examples are not to be considered all -inclusive. It is recommended that the instructor forward a concise written statement describing the academic dishonesty of an incident with its particulars to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs for violations in Levels Two through Four. These records will be ma intained until graduation or until they are of no further administrative value. This will enable better handling of multiple violations. (a) Level One Violations Level One violations may occur because of inexperience or lack of knowledge of principles of academic integrity on the part of persons committing the violation. These violations address incidents when intent is questionable and are likely to involve a smal l fraction of the total course work, are not extensive, and/or occur on a minor assignment. The following are examples: 1. Working with another student on a laboratory or other homework assignment when such work is prohibited. 2. Failure to footnote or giv e proper acknowledgment in an extremely limited section of an assignment. Recommended sanctions for Level One violations are listed below : Reduction or no credit given for the original assignment. An assigned paper or research project on a relevant topic . A make -up assignment at a more difficult level than the original assignment. Required attendance in a non -credit workshop or seminar on ethics or related subjects. (b) Level Two Violations Level Two violations are characterized by dishonesty of a more s erious character or that which affects a more si g- nificant aspect or portion of the course work. The following are examples: 1. Quoting directly or paraphrasing, to a moderate extent, without acknowledging the source. 2. Submitting the same work or major portions thereof to satisfy the requirements of more than one course without permission from the instructor. 3. Using data or interpretative material for a laboratory report without acknowledging the sources or the co l- laborators. All contributors to preparation of data and/or to writing the report must be named. 4. Receiving assistance from others, such as research, statistical, computer programming, or field data collection help that constitutes an essential element in the undertaking without acknowledging such assistance in a paper, examination or project. Recommended sanctions for Level Two violations are listed below : Failing grade for the assignment involved with the grade in the course determined in the normal manner. Failing grade for the course, which may be an \"F\" or \"FF\" on the internal transcript. (c) Level Three Violations Level Three violations are those that go beyond Level One or Two violations and that affect a major or essential portion of work done to meet course requirements, or involve premeditation, or are preceded by one or more vi o- lations at Levels One and/or Two. Examples include: 1. Copying on examinations. 2. Plagiarizing major portions of a written assignment. 3. Acting to facilitate copy ing during an exam. 58Records and Registration 4. Using prohibited materials, e.g. books, notes, or calculators during an examination. 5. Collaborating before an exam to develop methods of exchanging information and implementation thereof. 6. Altering examinations for the purposes of regrading. 7. Acquiring or distributing an examination from unauthorized sources prior to the examination. 8. Presenting the work of another as one's own. 9. Using purchased term paper or other materials. 10. Removing posted or reserved material, or preventing other students from having access to it. 11. Fabricating data by inventing or deliberately altering material (this includes citing \"sources\" that are not, in fact, sources. 12. Using unethical or improp er means of acquiring data. Recommended sanctions for Level Three violations are listed below : Failing grade for the course with a designation of \"FF\" on student's internal transcript. Possible suspension from the University for one semester. (d) Level Four Violations Level Four violations represent the most serious breaches of intellectual honesty. Examples of Level Four violations include: 1. All academic infractions committed after return from suspension for a previous academic honesty viol ation. 2. Infractions of academic honesty in ways similar to criminal activity (such as forging a grade form, stealing an examination from a professor or from a University office; buying an examination; or falsifying a transcript to secure entry into the U niversity or change the record of work done at the University) . 3. Having a substitute take an examination or taking an examination for someone else. 4. Fabrication of evidence, falsification of data, quoting directly or paraphrasing without acknowledgi ng the source, and/or presenting the ideas of another as one's own in a senior thesis, within a master's thesis or doctoral dissertation, in scholarly articles submitted to refereed journals, or in other work represented as one's own as a graduate student. 5. Sabotaging another student's work through actions designed to prevent the student from successfully co m- pleting an assignment. 6. Willful violation of a canon of the ethical code of the profession for which a student is preparing. Recommended sanctio ns for Level Four violations are listed below : The typical sanction for all Level Four violations is permanent academic dismissal from the University with the designation of \"Dismissed for Academic Dishonesty\" to be placed permanently on a student's extern al transcript. (5) Additional Undergraduate Guidelines for Academic Dishonesty: (a) Grade Assignment 1. An \"FF\" grade assigned to indicate academic dishonesty is reflected only on internal records and prevents the student from repeating the course using the Grade Forgiveness Policy. Students with any \"FF\" grade on record will not be eligible for honors at graduation. 2. If a student who has been accused of academic dishonesty drops the course, the student's registration in the course wil l be reinstated until the issue is resolved. 3. Any assigned grade may be changed to an \"FF\", \"F\", or other grade depending on the instructor's decision or the ultimate resolution of an academic grievance procedure. This includes any instance of academic dishonesty that is not detected by the instructor until after the student has dropped or completed the course. 4. Notification to the student of the \"FF\" grade and the option of appeal concerning the alleged academic di s- honesty shall be the responsibility of the instructor and/or department chair (See Student Academic Grievance Procedures). 5. Notice that a student has been dismissed for reasons of academic dishonesty will be reflected on the student's transcript with the formal notation: Dismissed for Ac ademic Dishonesty. 6. More serious violations of academic integrity may be referred to the Office of Students Rights and Respons i- bilities as a student conduct violation. (b) Multiple Violations: 1. For the first \"FF\" recorded in an undergraduate student 's USF academic record, the student will receive a letter from the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs informing him or her of being placed on \"Academic Dishonesty Warning\" for the remainder of enrollment at USF and of appeal rights for the \"FF\" grade. 2. For the second \"FF\" recorded, the undergraduate student will be suspended for one full semester and readmitted only after writing Records and Registration 59 a clear statement indicating remorse, understanding of the seriousness of the offense, and understanding of the importance of integrity in all areas, including academic work. A letter informing him or her of this action and appeal rights will be sent from the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. 3. For the third \"FF\" recorded, the undergraduate student will be permanently dismissed f rom the University for violations of academic integrity and with notice of that dismissal as a part of the formal record and transcript. 4. The maximum penalty for receipt of any \"FF\" grade may be permanent dismissal from the University for v i- olations of a cademic integrity and with a notice of that dismissal as a part of the student's formal record and transcript. (6) Violations and Sanctions for Graduate Students:2 The Graduate School holds academic integrity in the highest regard. Graduate students are r esponsible for being aware of and complying with University Regulations and Policies and must conduct themselves accordingly. Sanctions for Academic Dishonesty will depend on the seriousness of the offense and may range from the receipt of: An \"F\" or \"Zer o\" grade on the subject paper, lab report, etc. An \"F\" in the course or activity in which credit may be earned. An \"FF\" in the course (leading to expulsion from the University). Academic Dismissal for any violations of academic dishonesty policies or regulations. Possible revocation of the degree or Graduate Certificate following a thorough investigation. Graduate students who are assigned an \"FF\" grade will be academically dismi ssed from the University and will not be eligible to apply to any graduate program at USF. Procedures regarding Academic Dishonesty and Academic Dismissal may be found on the Graduate School website. (7) Additional Graduate Guidelines for Academic Dishones ty: 1. If a graduate student who has been accused of academic dishonesty drops the course, the student's registration in the course will be reinstated until the issue is resolved. 2. Any assigned grade may be changed to an \"FF\", \"F\", or other grade depen ding on the instructor's decision or the ultimate resolution of an academic grievance procedure. This includes any instance of academic dishonesty that is not detected until after the student has dropped or completed the course. 3. Notification to the gra duate student of the \"FF\" grade and the option of appeal concerning the alleged academic dishonesty and academic dismissal remains with the instructor and/or department chair (See Student Academic Grievance Procedures). 4. A graduate student who has been dismissed for reasons of academic dishonesty will have this reflected on the student's transcript with the formal notation: Dismissed for Academic Dishonesty. 5. More serious violations of academic integrity may be referred to the Office of Students Right s and Respons i- bilities as a student conduct violation. (8) Appeals: Undergraduate and Graduate Once the initial violation of the academic integrity regulation has been documented and fairly discussed by the student and the instructor, the student may appeal the instructor's decision that a violation has occurred. At that point the student will follow the procedures outlined in the University of South Florida's student Academic Grievanc e Procedure Policy. For academic integrity violations that are reviewed at the department and college levels, the respective committees will consider all evidence available to determine if the instructor's decision was correct. The student's ability to pro ceed within an academic program while an Academic Grievance is in process will be dete r- mined by the individual academic program chair/director. 1 These policies apply to Undergraduate Students, even if taking graduate coursework. Graduate students are students admitted to a graduate degree program or graduate certificate, and/or non -degree seeking students taking graduate coursework (such students should refer to Section IV Violations and Sanctions fo r Graduate Students) 2 These policies apply to Graduate Students (students admitted to a graduate degree program or graduate certificate, and/or non -degree seeking students taking graduate coursework). Undergraduate students should refer to Section III Violations and Sanctions for Undergraduate Students) Authority: Art. IX, Sec. 7, Fla. Constitution and Resolutions issued by the FL Board of Governors History -New 12 -11-08. Disruption of Academic P rocess (1) Disruptive students in the academic setting hinder the educational process. Although disruptive student conduct is already prohibited by the University of South Florida system (University/USF) Student Code of Conduct, the purpose of this regula tion is to clarify what constitutes disruptive behavior in the academic setting; what actions faculty and relevant academic officers may take in response to disruptive conduct; and the authority of the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (or desi gnated office handling conduct issues in Student Affairs) to initiate separate disciplinary proceedings against students for disruptive conduct. 60Records and Registration (2) Disruption of the academic process is defined as the act, words, or general conduct of a student in a clas sroom or other academic environment which in the reasonable estimation of the instructor: (a) Directs attention away from the academic matters at hand, such as noisy distractions, persistent, disrespectful or abusive interruption of lecture, exam, academi c discussion, or general University operations, or (b) Presents a danger to the health, safety or well -being of self or other persons. References to classroom or academic area include all academic settings (live or online, and including field exper i- ences ). References to Instructor include the course instructor, USF St. Petersburg faculty, administrators, and staff. Misconduct occurring in other campus areas on University premises or which adversely affects the University community and/or the pursuit of it s mission is already prohibited by the Student Code of Conduct and will be handled by those procedures. Academic discussion that includes disagreement with the course instructor during times when the instructor permits discussion is not in itself disruptiv e behavior and is not prohibited. Some disruptive students may have emotional or mental health disorders. Although such students may be considered disabled and are protected under the Rehabilitation Act/ADA, they are held to the same standards of conduct a s any student. The following applies to all campuses of the University of South Florida system; however, non -substantive procedural modifications to reflect the particular circumstances of each separately accredited USF System institution are permitted. In formation concerning these procedures is available through the Student Affairs Office. (3) Procedures for Handling Disruption of Academic Process. (a) General Guidelines for Instructor: 1. If a student is disruptive, the Instructor may ask the student to stop the disruptive behavior and/or warn the student that such disruptive behavior can result in academic and/or disciplinary action. Alleged disruptions of the academic process will be handled initially by the Instructor, who will discuss the incident wit h the student whenever possible. It must be noted that the Faculty Senate considers the traditional relationship between student and instructor as the primary means of settling disputes that may arise. 2. The Instructor is authorized to ask a student to leave the classroom or academic area and desist from the disruptive behavior if the Instructor deems it necessary. If the Instructor does this, s/he will send an Academic Disruption Incident Report withi n 48 hours simultaneously to: a. The department chair, b. The Assistant/Associate Dean of the College (as determined by the College), c. The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR) or the separately accredited institution's/regional campus' designated office in Student Affairs, and d. The student. If the situation is deemed an emergency or circumstances require more immediate action, the instructor should notify the appropriate law enforcement agency, OSRR and other authorities as soon as possible. Any filed Incident Report can, and should, be updated if new information pertinent to the situation is obtained. 3. An Instructor may also further exclude the student from the classroom or other academic area pending res o- lution of the matter. If the Instructor recommends exclusion (temporary or permanent) from the classroom pending resolution, the student must be informed of the exclusion before the next scheduled class (either by phone, email or in person). That notice must: a. Inform the stude nt of the exclusion, b. Inform the student of his/her right to request an expedited review of the exclusion within two days to the Chair of the Department. If such academic exclusion occurs, and if the student requests a review, the Chair of the Departme nt shall review the exclusion within two days of the date the student requests the review and decide if the student can return to the specific class and/or any academic setting. This decision may be appealed in writing by the student within two (2) days to the Dean of the college or the institutional designee (as appropriate) for review and decision within two days. Any decision rendered at that point must be in writing and will serve as the final and binding academic decision of the University. Each academ ic decision or sanction must be communicated to the Office of Students Rights and Responsibilities or the separately accredited institution's/regional campus' designated office as soon as possible. (b) Possible Academic Sanctions and Grading Guidelines: Authority of an Instructor and the appropriate Chair or Assistant/Associate Dean may result in any of the following sanctions: Warning to the student. Records and Registration 61 Voluntary withdrawal by the student from the class(es). Temporary exclusion and/or permanent dismissal from the instructor's classroom or academic area, program, or college, pending an expedited appeal. Academic sanction, including assignment of a final grade. -- If the final determination is a dismissal from c lass, the grade assigned for the class will depend on the student's status at the time of dismissal. If the student had a passing grade in the class at the time of dismissal, a grade of \"W\" will be assigned for the course. If the student had a failing grad e in the class at the time of dismissal, a grade of \"F\" will be assigned for the course. These grades will become a part of the student's permanent record. In addition, if the academic disruption results in dismissal from more than the classroom or academi c area of the incident, this grading policy may be applied in all classes affected. (c) Documentation and Academic Disruption Incident Report: Instructors should be aware that notes of the dates, times, witnesses and details of the incidents of disruption and the impact of the disruption on those present may be important in any future proceedings which may be ne c- essary. Referrals to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or designated office in Student Affairs r e- quire written documentation conta ining factual and descriptive information. The student is entitled to see this documentation. The Academic Disruption Incident Report must be submitted by hardcopy (not email) simultaneously within 48 hours to: 1. The department chair, 2. The Assistant/A ssociate Dean of the College (as determined by the College), 3. The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or the separately accredited institution's regional campus' designated office in Student Affairs, and 4. The student. The form can be downl oaded from the designated website in Student Affairs or completed by way of mem o- randum containing the following information: Date of report Student's name Student name Instructor's Instructor's -mail Title of course, course number and section Date/time/location of incident Detailed summary of the incident, including a description of the disruptive behavior Witnesses Action, if any, taken by the instructor (e.g., student warned, asked to leave the class , etc.) Recommended course of action and reasons for this recommendation Instructor's signature (d) Possible Disciplinary Sanctions for Conduct by the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities: Upon receipt of the Academic Disruption Inci dent Report or other academic referral for disruptive conduct, the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or designated office in Student Affairs may initiate the disciplinary process resulting in the imposition of any of the following sanctions in addition to any academic sanctions imposed (in section b): Educational sanctions to include but not limited to educational programs/classes and written assignment Disciplinary probation Provisional suspension Suspension Restriction from certain or all cla ss(es), program, college, residence hall, or any part or all of USF System institutions. Expulsion When an incident is being reviewed by OSRR or designated office in Student Affairs for possible disciplinary sanctions, current provisions affecting the stu dent's academic status (temporary or otherwise) will be comm u- 62Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures nicated by the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or designated office in Student Affairs to the I n- structor and appropriate academic administrators/instructors responsible for the stud ent's current academic standing as soon as possible, but within two weeks of the reported incident. Only final disciplinary sanctions that affect the academic status of the student will be communicated to the Instructor(s) and appropriate academic administ rators after the disciplinary process is complete.

The University is interested in each student making reasonable progress towards his/her educational goals and will aid each student through guidance and faculty advising. To make students aware of their academic progress, the University has enacted a system of grading and policies of Academic Probation and Academic Dismissal that indicates whether or not a student is showing s ufficient progress toward meeting degree requirements. Notations of Grades, Academic Probation and Academic Dismissal are posted to the student's academic record. When a student is academically dismissed from the University and is ineligible to re -enroll, it may be in his/her best interest to re -evaluate his/her educational goals with an academic advisor. If the student's poor academic performance has resulted from extenuating circumstances or if after a period of time the student feels he/she has gained ad equate maturity and motivation, he/she may petition the Academic Regulations Committee for permission to re -enroll. See Academic Regulations Committee, for information on petitioning. Academic Dismissal may have additional implications for a student receiv ing financial aid. If required, a student may need to complete the Satisfactory Progress for Financial Aid Recipients Petition. For more information, see http://usfweb2.usf.edu/finaid/other/satisfactory_progress.htm . Grading System Effective Fall Semester, 2000, USF St. Petersburg faculty may use a plus/minus grading system to assign student grades. The use of the plus/minus grading system is at the discretion of the individual faculty member. A student' s measure of academic achievement is recorded on the academic record based on the following grading system: Plus/Minus Grades A+ 4.00 A Excellent performance 4.00 B+ 3.33 B Good performance 3.00 B- C Average performance 2.00 C- 1.67 D+ D Poor performance 1.00 D- F Failure 0.00 GRADES , FINANCIAL AID REQUIREMENTS , AND REVIEW PROCEDURES Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures 63 Other Grades E Course repeated, not included in GPA FF Failure/academic dishonesty I Incomplete IF Incomplete grade changed to Failure IU Incomplete grade changed to Unsatisfactory M No grade submitted by instructor MF Missing grade changed to Failure MU Missing grade changed to Unsatisfactory N Audit S Satisfactory U Unsatisfactory W Withdrawal from course without penalty WC Withdrawal for extenuating circumstances Z Indicates continuing registration. Please note that the grade of C - will satisfy specified minimum requirements of the Gordon Rule courses and the common prerequisites unless otherwise specified in the Catalog. Grade Point Average The University uses the quality points listed above. The grade -point average (GPA) is computed by dividing the total number of quality points by the total hours attempted within the USF system. The total quality points are figured by multiplying the number of credits assigned to each course by the quality point value of the grade given. Credit hours for courses with grades of I, IU, M, MU, N, S, U, W, Z, and grades that are preceded by a \"E\" are subtracted from the total hours attempted before the GPA is ca lculated. Multiple attempts on courses designated as repeatable in the course catalog will provide for hours and quality points on each attempt to be applied to the student's grade point average. \"D\" and \"F\" grades established in USF system coursework not designated as repeatable for additional credit will be calculated into the student's GPA as many times as \"D's\" or \"F's\" are earned in the same course. If a student earns a grade of \"C -\" or higher in a course that may not be repeated for additional credit and earns a \"C -\" of higher on a subsequent enrollment the new grade is not computed into the student's GPA unless the student applies for and is eligible to receive a grade forgiveness. \"I\" Grade Policy Incomplete (I) Definition: An Incomplete grade (\"I\") is exceptional and granted at the instructor's discretion only when students are unable to complete course requirements due to illness or other circumstances beyond their control. This applies to all grada ble courses, including pass/fail (S/U). Students may only be eligible for an \"I\" when: A majority of the student's work for a course is complete before the end of the semester (more than 50%). The work that has been completed is qualitatively satisfactor y. The student requests consideration for an \"I\" grade as soon as possible but no later than the last day of finals week. The student must request consideration for an Incomplete grade and obtain an \"I\" Grade Contract from the instructor of record. Even t hough the student may meet the eligibility requirements for this grade, the course instructor retains the right to make the final decision on granting a student's request for an Incomplete. The course instructor and student must complete and sign the \"I\" Grade Contract Form that describes the work to be completed, the date it is due, and the grade the student would earn factoring in a zero for all incomplete assig n- ments. The due date can be negotiated and extended by student/instructor as long as it does not exceed two semesters from the original date grades were due for that course for undergraduates and non -degree -seeking students. The instructor must file a copy of the \"I\" Grade Contract in the department/college that offered the course and the Registr ar's Office by the date grades are due. The instructor must not require students to either re -register for the course or audit the course in order to complete the \"I\" grade contract. Students may register to audit the course, with the instructor's approv al, but cannot re -take the course for credit until the \"I\" grade is cleared. An \"I\" grade contract that is not completed within the approved time frame (including summer semester) will revert to the original grade noted on the contract. \"I\" grades are not computed in the GPA, but the grade noted on the contract will be computed in the GPA, retroactive to the semester the course is taken, if the contract is not fulfilled by the specified date. 64Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures \"M\" Grade Polic y An \"M\" is automatically assigned as a default grade when the instructor does not submit a grade for a student. (U n- dergraduate rules also apply to non -degree -seeking students.) Unless a change of grade is submitted, the \"M\" grade will remain on the transc ript and will not be computed in the student's GPA. S/U Grade System No-option Courses. Certain courses have been designated as S/U courses. The \"S\" and \"U\" grades are used to indicate the student' s final grade. These S/U only courses are identified with (S/U only) after the course definition in this catalog. No grading system option is available to students or faculty in these courses. Option Courses. Any undergraduate course may be taken on an S/U basis by a student under the following conditions and restrictions: 1. Required courses in the major may not be taken on an S/U basis unless specifically designated 2. Courses supporting the student's major and state mandated common prerequ isites may not be taken on an S/U basis. 3. Courses to satisfy 6A -10.30 (Gordon Rule) may not be taken on an S/U basis. 4. Courses to satisfy USF St. Petersburg's B.A. foreign language requirement may not be taken on an S/U basis. 5. All elective courses for the ma jor and all elective courses in the general education requirements, and all other free elective courses may be taken on an S/U basis except where: a. The certifying college restricts the number of courses that may be taken on an S/U basis in any one or all of the above areas or restricts the total number of S/U courses that can be accepted for all of the above areas. b. The certifying college specifies t hat certain courses may not be taken on an S/U basis. c. The instructor of a course refuses to allow the course to be taken on an S/U basis. 6. Once of the Major Works and Major Issues courses , if taken outside the student's major discipline(s) may be taken S/U credit with instructor consent. Mechanism for Assigning S/U Grades . The method by which a student receives an \"S\" or \"U\" grade in an option course will consist of the following: 1. A written agreement signed by both instructor and student shall be filed with the college offering the S/U course. . The college shall set the deadline (no later than the last day of classes for the term) for the student to decide if he/she wishes to take the course on an S/U basis. 2. The instructor shall assign final letter grades A, B, C, D, F, or I, but will transmit to the Registrar \"S\" or \"U\" consistent with the following: a. Letter grade, A, B, C, or C - shall be equivalent to a letter grade of \"S.\" b. Letter grades D or F shall be equivalent to a letter grade of \"U.\" \"S\" and \"U\" grades are not computed in the student's GPA. Grade Forgiveness Policy USF St. Petersburg's forgivene ss policy permits an undergraduate to repeat a course and have the repeated grade computed in his/her GPA in place of the original grade, providing the repeat grade is posted as \"D -\" or higher (exception - see Honors at Graduation)and is higher than the fi rst grade. Normally, grade forgiveness may only be applied to a specific course that a student chooses to repeat. No course taken on the S/U grade basis may have the grade forgiveness applied. Under unusual circumstances, a different but similar course may be used if the substitute course has been previously approved by the college dean and is on file in the Office of the Registrar. The grade forgiveness policy cannot apply to any course in which the grade of \"FF\" has been recorded. Any undergraduate or non -degree -seeking student who wishes to implement grade forgiveness must: 1. Complete a \"Grade Forgiveness Request Form\" (available in the Office of the Registrar) for each course to be r e- peated. 2. Adhere to the following conditions: a. A limitation of applying grade forgiveness to three USF system courses with no more than one repeat per course. b. With prior approval of the college dean, a course different from a course on the approved list may be substituted in the following cases: 1. The substitute course is a change in prefix, number, hours, or title, but not a substantive change in content from the original course. 2. The substitute course replaces a course no longer offered by the institution. c. The repeated course must be taken under the standard grading system (A -F) and the latest grade must be posted as \"D-\" or higher (grades o f S/U are not permitted) and be higher than the first grade. Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures 65 d. All grades remain on the transcript. The original course grade will be annotated with \"E\" to indicate that the course has subsequently been repeated and the original grade is not computed in the GPA. e. Individual colleges may have further restrictions; therefore, the student should consult with his/her academic advisor. This policy is applicable to undergraduate and non -degree -seeking students only, and applies to 1000 -to-5000-level courses. Once st udents have been awarded a bachelor's degree from USF St. Petersburg, they may not repeat a course and be forgiven the original grade, taken prior to graduation. The policy applies only to courses taken originally at any USF system and repeated at a USF sy stem institution. Good Standing USF St. Petersburg students will be considered in good standing if they are currently enrolled or eligible to return to USF St. Petersburg. Academic Record The student's academic record shall not be changed after the student has graduated. Academic P robation and Academic Dismissal for Undergraduate Students The first time an undergraduate student's USF grade point average (GPA) falls below a cumulative 2.00, the student will be placed on Academic Probation (AP). From the beginning of academic probatio n, the student must maintain at least a 2.00 GPA each term, and may not totally withdraw from any term without cause. Any student who withdraws from all classes after the fifth day of classes while on Academic Probation will be ac a- demically dismissed. Once on Academic Probation, academic advising prior to registration is mandatory until the student is removed from probationary status. The student may remain on Academic Probation indefinitely as long he/she maintains a GPA of 2.00 or greater each term. If at any time while on Academic Probation, the student's term GPA falls below a 2.00, the student will be academically dismissed from the University. Once academically dismissed, a student may only return to USFSP under the University's Academic Renewal Polici es. If academically dismissed from USFSP, a student may not return to USFSP as a non -degree seeking student. The determination and notification of probationary status or academic dismissal will be made by the Registrar's Office on the student's academic re cord. A student who attends another college or university following academic dismissal will be classified as a transfer student and readmission will be based on the total record accumulated from all colleges and universities attended. If a student is acade mically dismissed or falls below a 2.0 0 GPA from USFSP and subsequently receives a BA/BS from another four -year institution, that student, when accepted to the University with the post -baccalaureate status, will have his/her academic record cleared. Academic Renewal USF St. Petersburg recognizes that not every student's academic record is flawless and that many times students get off to such a poor start that their future academic opportunities are limited. USF St. Petersburg can offer many of those students a second chance. The University's Academic Renewal policy allows students previously dismissed from the university, to renew their pursuit of baccalaureate degrees without the responsibility of having to overcome the entire burden of low grades and low grade - point-averages. To facilitate this opportunity, students who qualify for Academic Renewal may, with the approval of the Academic Regulations Committee, have portions of their academic record e x- cluded from calculation of their grade point averages (GPAs). The entire academic record, however, will continue to be reflected on their transcripts even though a selected portion will not be counted in their GPAs. Academic Renewal students are admitted with th e same terms of academic probation and dismissal as other undergraduate students. Academic Renewal will only be applied to a student's academic record one time at USFSP. Academic Renewal I (ARI) - Students who have been academically dismissed or former stu dents returning with a USF GPA below 2.00 may petition the Academic Regulations Committee to return to the University under AR -I if they have been away from the University for at least one academic semester A student will be considered for reinstatement to the University under Academic Renewal I if they complete all after completing all requirements for a Bachelor's degree, or an Associate of Arts degree or an Arts degree equivalent (including general education, and Gordon Rule requirements) at a two - or four-year college. Under the Academic Renewal I policy, students will return to the University with a 0.00 GPA and Academic Renewal I students will enter USF as juniors and their USF grade point average will be calculated from that point forward. While AR -I is best utilized by students who have earned less than 60 credit hours, it is not restricted to those students. Students with more than 60 credit hours returning to the University under AR -I will likely incur excess hours and associated monetary penalty. I n order to graduate following re -admission under AR -I, all degree requirements must be met, and a minimum of 30 credit hours must be taken in residence at USF. Students who are admitted under AR -I may be excluded from admission to limited access programs a nd will not be considered for University Honors at gra d- uation unless they meet the criteria using all grades earned. 66Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures Academic Renewal II (ARII) - ARII is available to students who were academically dismissed and have 60 or more earned credits from USFSP o r other institutions of higher education. These Students may be readmitted to the University under Academic Renewal II if they are able to provide convincing evidence indicating they are likely to be successful. Ge n- erally, such students will have been enga ged in successful non -academic activities such as work or military service for at least one year or will have demonstrated recent academic success defined minimally as the completion of at least 12 semester hours with a GPA greater than or equal to 2.00, n o grades below C, no course withdrawals, and the CLAS requirement being met. In order to be considered for readmission under ARII, students must submit a request to the Academic Regulations Committee, who will, make a final decision regarding readmission. Following readmission under Academic Renewal II, students will have their prior USF GPA set to 2.00. In order to graduate, students must have a cumulative GPA of 2.00 and at least 30 USFSP credit hours with grades of C or higher, including a minimum of 15 USF credits earned following readmission under ARII. Students re -admitted under ARII may be excluded from admission to limited access programs. Further, students who exercise the Academic Renewal II policy will not be considered for University Honors at gr aduation unless they meet the criteria using all grades earned. College Policies for Academic Progress Colleges may determine and implement standards of academic progress for undergra duate students (majors in the college) in addition to those established by USF St. Petersburg. Students who do not meet the academic standards of progress set by their colleges will be placed on probation and may be disenrolled. The college dean is respons ible for implementing standards of academic progress and for notifying students of their probationary or disenrollment status. Colleges may restrict the course selections and the numbers of hours a student may take that do not apply toward completion of de gree requirements. Students who exceed this limit may have part or all of their registration canceled. Colleges are responsible for publicizing and students are responsible for knowing their college's policies for academic progress. Class Standing A student's class is determined by the number of credits he/she has earned without relation to his/her GPA. 0C Unclassified Non -degree -seeking students 1F Freshman 0 through 29 semester hours passed 2S Sophomore 30 through 59 semester hours passed 3J Junior 60 through 89 semester hours passed 4R Senior 90 or more semester hours passed; however, no baccalaureate degree earned here or elsewhere 5B Baccalaureate degree -holder working o n a second undergraduate program or degree 6M Graduate student admitted to Master's Degree Program 6A Graduate student admitted to Specialist Degree Program 6C Graduate student Admitted to Candidacy 6D Graduate student admitted to a Doctoral Degree Program 7A-7D 1st-4th year professional program (M.D.) or post -doctoral status Change of Major All undergraduate students desiring to change their major shou ld consult the Academic Advising Center. Administrative Holds A student may be placed on administrative hold by failure to meet obligations to the University. When a student is on administrative hold, he/she may not be allowed to register, receive a diploma, or receive a transcript. Settlement of financial accounts must be made at the University Cashier's Office. Each student placed on administrative hold should determine from the Office of the Registra r which office placed him/her in this status and clear the obligation with that respective office. Student Information Changes Notifications regarding changes of address, name, residency, and ci tizenship should be filed promptly with the Office of the Registrar. Midterm Grades (USF System Regulation 10 -504) It is the student' s sole responsibility to be aware of their academic standing and grade status in all courses. In an a t- tempt to assist the student in evaluating his academic status mid -term, the University requires Instructors to submit midterm grades electronically for ea ch student enrolled in 1000, 2000 and 3000* level courses. This is a courtesy to the student and failure of an instructor to post the mid -term grades will not be grounds for a student academic grievance nor will it be justification for a retroactive drop a s the student is presumed to be aware of current academic status. Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures 67 Final Examinations Examinations in academic subjects are, for most courses, an integral part of the learning process and one part of a procedure for evaluating student performance and determining grades. USF St. Petersburg requires certain standards for the examination proce ss in order to protect the academic integrity of courses and the best interests of both the student and the instructor. Testing in General: In each academic course, the student is expected to undergo a meaningful testing and evaluation that will reveal the student's intellectual growth in the subject matter covered or otherwise reflect the achievement of the course objectives. The instructor has the responsibility of maintaining a fair and impartial testing and examination procedure, has the right to define and structure the testing process, and shall not be restricted as to form, style or content of the examination. It is the policy of USF St. Petersburg that all students facing an examination (of any type) shall have equal advance notice of the form and co ntent of that examination. The University regards the routine use of all or part of the same formal examination for successive academic terms as unsound policy except when used with adequate safeguards such as a random selection of questions from a large p ool. Comprehensive Final Examinations: The last 6 days of the Fall and Spring semesters shall be set aside for final exam i- nations, and any comprehensive final examination must be given during this designated period. If a segment examination is given in lie u of a comprehensive examination, the segment examination must be given in the period designated during final examination week. The period of two hours shall be allotted for each final examination. If a student has a direct conflict of scheduled examinatio ns or has three or more examinations scheduled on the same day, the student may petition the appropriate instructor to reschedule one of the student's examinations. The final examination schedule shall be published in the same manner and place as the Sched ule of Classes. Regional Chancellor's Scholar List Full-time USFSP undergraduate students who demonstrate superior academic achievement during one semester will be honored on a \"Regional Chancellor's Scholar List.\" To be eligible for the Regional Chancellor's Scholar List, a student must complete at least 12 USF credit hours of graded (A -F) courses, receive no incomplete grades during the semester and earn a 4.0 semester GPA Dean's List Full-time undergraduate students who demonstrate superior academic achievement during one semester will be honored on a \"Dean's List\". To be eligible for the Dean's List, a student must be in a 'pool' (defined hereafter) and must complete 12 hours of graded (A -F) USF system courses with no incomplete grades during the semester. The Dean's List shall consist of the fewer of: 1) the upper 10% of the enrollment of the college or 2)students in the college with a US F 3.5 GPA or above (ties at the 90th percentile will be included in the group). The dean of the college in which the student is majoring or the Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs for the undeclared students will recognize this academic honor. Students w ho believe they are eligible should contact their academic advisor. Academic Regulations Committee The USF St. Petersburg Academic Regulations Committee (ARC) is responsible for serving as an undergraduate academic regulatory board for students who are designated as USF St. Petersburg students and wish to be exempted from an Undergraduate Academic Policy. The Committee is authorized to act both individually and collectively in responding to student petitions. Since any student has the right to appeal academic decisions, there is also an Academic Appeal Board to hear and adjudicate appeals to ARC decisions. The ARC Appeal Board is the final point of petition for a student - there is no higher authority. Students should contact their Academic Advisor if considering an ARC Petition. Student Academic Grievance Procedures I. Introduction (Purpose and Intent) The purpose of t hese procedures is to provide all undergraduate and graduate students taking courses within the University of South Florida system an opportunity for objective review of facts and events pertinent to the cause of the academic grievance. Such review will be accomplished in a collegial, non -judicial atmosphere rather than an adversarial one, and shall allow the parties involved to participate. All parties will be expected to act in a profe s- sional and civil manner. The procedures that follow are designed to ensure objective and fair treatment of both students and instructors. These guidelines are meant to govern all colleges, however, as individual USF institutions and the appropriate co l- leges may have different leve ls of authority or titles, each student must obtain the specific designations used by each entity for levels of authority and titles in this process. 68Grades, Financial Aid R equirements, and Review Procedures In the case of grade appeals, the University reserves the right to change a student's grade if it is deter mined at the conclusion of the grievance process that the grade given was incorrect. In such circumstances, the Dean or Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs may file an administrative grade change. The term \"incorrect\" means the assigned grade was based on something other than performance in the course, or that the assignment of the grade was not consistent with the criteria for awarding of grades as described in the course syllabus or other materials distributed to the student. In the case of all other aca demic grievances, the University reserves the right to determine the final outcome based on the procedures detailed herein. In the case of Academic Integrity (USF System Regulation 3.027) violations, these Student Academic Grievance Procedures apply and in clude an Academic Integrity Review Process at the College Level as described in section III below. II. Terms and Guidelines An \"academic grievance\" is a claim that a specific academic decision or action that affects that student's academic record or stat us has violated published policies and procedures, or has been applied to the grievant in a manner different from that used for other students. Grievances may relate to such decisions as the assignment of a grade seen by the student as incorrect or the dis missal or failure of a student for his or her action(s). Academic grievances will not deal with general student complaints. \"Instructor\" shall mean any classroom instructor, thesis/dissertation/directed study supervisor, committee member or chair, or couns elor/advisor who interacts with the student in an academic environment. \"Department Chair/Director\" shall mean the academic head of a college department or the director of a program \u2014or in all cases a \"Department's designee\" appointed to handle academic gri evances. \"Dean\" shall mean a College Dean or the equivalent as indicated \u2014or in all cases a \"Dean's designee\" appointed to handle academic grievances for the unit. \"Time\" shall mean \"academic time,\" that is, periods when University classes are in session. T he person vested with authority at the appropriate level may extend any of the time periods contained herein for good cause. Any e x- tensions must be communicated in writing to all parties. For the purposes of this policy, each step shall be afforded three ( 3) weeks as a standard time limit. When a department considers a grievance according to published d e- partmental procedures approved by the College Dean and Regional Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, as pert i- nent, the time line specified in this academic unit's procedures will govern the process and no additional notice of time extension is needed. \"Written communication\" shall mean communication by hard copy to the recipient's address of record. The \"burden of proof\" shall be upon the student such that t he student challenging the decision, action or grade assigned has the burden of supplying evidence that proves that the instructor's decision was incorrect, in all cases except alleged violations of academic integrity. In cases where the issue is academic integrity, the burden of proof shall be upon the instructor. In considering grievances, decisions will be based on the preponderance of the ev i- dence. Neither party shall be entitled to bring \"legal representation\" to any actual grievance proceeding as this is an internal review of an academic decision. As some Colleges may use different titles, the next level that applies to that College shall be substituted. III. Statement of Policy A. Resolution at the Department Level 1. The student shall first make a reasonable effort to resolve his or her grievance with the instructor co n- cerned, with the date of the incident triggering the start of the process (i.e. the issuance of a grade; the receipt of an assignment) and the instructor shall accommodate a reasonab le request to discuss and a t- tempt to resolve this issue. 2. If the situation cannot be resolved or the instructor is not available, the student shall file a notification letter within three weeks of the triggering incident to the department Chairperson/Di rector. This shall be a concise written statement of particulars and must include information pertaining to how, in the student's opinion, University policies or procedures were violated. The department Chairperson/Director shall pr o- vide a copy of this sta tement to the instructor. 3. The department Chairperson/Director shall discuss the statement jointly or individually with the student and the instructor to see if the grievance can be resolved. If the department maintains its own grievance procedure,* it should be applied at this point. If the grievance can be resolved, the Chairperson/Director shall provide a statement to that effect to the student and the instructor with a copy to the College Dean. *Departments may develop their own formal procedures for considering grievances. Such procedures must be consi d- ered and approved by the College Dean and the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, and published on the Depar t- ment's web site. When such procedu res exist, the Department's examination of the grievance will unfold as specified in the procedures. If the Departmental process upholds the student's grievance, the Department Chair will work with the College, the student and the instructor to remedy the situation. If the Department does not uphold the grievance, Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures 69 the Chair will report the fact to the Dean. The student may, in such cases, request the College Level review as outlined in these University procedures. 4. If the grievance cannot be resolved, th e department Chair/Director shall notify both the student and the instructor, informing the student of his/her right to file a written request within three weeks to advance the grievance to the College Level. The instructor may file a written response to t he grievance petition. Upon receipt of the student's request to move the process to the College Level and the instructor's r e- sponse to the grievance (if provided), the Chairperson/Director shall immediately notify the College Dean of the grievance, providi ng copies of the student's initiating grievance statement, any instructor's written response to the grievance, and the written request from the student to have the process advanced to the College Level (which may include additional responsive or final stat ements by the student). Should the student not file a written request to move the grievance to the College Level within the prescribed time, the grievance will end. If the grievance concerns the Chairperson/Director or other officials of the department, t he student has a right to bypass the departmental process and proceed directly to the College Level. B. Resolution at the College Level 1. Upon receipt of the grievance, the College Dean shall either determine that the matter is not an academic grievance and dismiss it or within three weeks shall establish an Academic Grievance Committee. The membership of the Committee shall be constituted as follows: a. Three (3) faculty members and two (2) students (undergraduate or graduate as appropriate to the case ) shall be selected from the college by the Dean. b. Wherever practical, the Committee shall not include members of the faculty or students of the d e- partment directly involved with the grievance, or faculty or students of the student's major depar t- ment. T he student or faculty may address the committee. However, if requested by the committee; faculty or students from the department involved with the grievance or from the student's major department may provide expert or other relevant testimony in the procee dings. 2. The Committee will operate in the following manner: a. The Committee Chairperson will be appointed by the College Dean from among the three faculty members appointed to the Committee. b. The Committee Chairperson shall be responsible for sched uling meetings, overseeing the deliberations of the committee and ensuring that full and fair consideration is provided to all parties. The Committee Chairperson shall vote on committee decisions only when required to break a tie. c. In Committee reviews involving Academic Integrity, the following Academic Integrity Review Process shall be followed: 1. The Committee Chairperson shall notify the student and instructor of the date and time of the meeting. 2. The student and instructor may submit a list of questions to the Committee Chairperson to be answered by the student and instructor. If submitted, the questions will be disseminated by the Committee Chairperson and the Committee Chairperson will ensure that the questions are a n- swered in writing and subm itted for review by the Committee, student, and instructor before the initial meeting. 3. The student or instructor may request to attend a Committee meeting as designated by the Chairperson to present any final statement to the Committee and either may b e present during the other's final statement. Neither the student nor instructor may be present during the deliber a- tions. 4. The student or instructor may bring an advisor (not to act as legal counsel or to participate in the meetings) to the meeting. 5. Students shall be permitted to remain in the course or program during the Academic Integrity Review Process. However, if the student is in a clinical or internship setting, the student may be removed from such setting until the issue of Academic Integrity is resolved. In such cases, the program will attempt to identify an alternative educational option to the clinical or internship to enable the student to continue progressing in the program. d. All deliberations shall be in private and held confidential by all members of the Committee. The recommendation of the Committee shall be based on the factual evidence presented to it. e. Within three weeks of the Committee appointment, the Committee Chairperson shall deliver in writing to the student, instructor, department Chairperson/Director or Program Director, and College Dean a report of the findings and a recommended resolution. f. Within three weeks of receipt of the Committee recommendation, the College Dean shall provide a decision in writing to all par ties. g. The student or the instructor may appeal the decision of the College Dean to the University Level only if the decision of the College Dean is contrary to the recommendation of the Committee or if there is a procedural violation of these Student A cademic Grievance Procedures. Such an appeal must be made in writing to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs within three weeks of receipt of the decision from 70Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures the College Dean. Otherwise, the College Dean's decision is final and not subject to further appeal within the University. C. Resolution at the University Level The Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs at USF St. Petersburg may delegate authority to a designated ac a- demic administrator at USF St. Petersburg to hear the appeal at the University le vel. 1. The student or the instructor may appeal at the University Level within three weeks of the receipt of a decision made at the College Level, when (1) the decision by a College Dean is contrary to the reco m- mendation of a college Grievance Committee, or (2) there is cause to think a procedural violation of these University Academic Grievance Procedures has been made. Within three weeks of receipt of the appeal to the decision, the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs in consultation with the Faculty Senate and the Student Senate, shall appoint an Appeals Committee consisting of three faculty members drawn from the University Undergraduate C ouncil or Graduate Council (as appropriate), and two students, undergraduate or graduate (as appropriate). 2. The structure, functions and operating procedures of the Appeals Committee will be the same as those of the College Committee (i.e. chaired by o ne of the appointed faculty members appointed by the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs who will not vote except in the case of a tie, having no representation from either party's respective departments, developing a recommendation to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. 3. Within three weeks of the appointment, the Committee Chairperson shall deliver in writing to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs a report of the findings of the Committee and a recommended resolution. 4. Within three weeks of receipt of the Committee recommendation, the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs shall provide a decision in writing to all parties. 5. If the Vice Chancellor's decision is that a grade change is merited, the Vice Chancellor sh all initiate the grade change on the authority of the Provost and so inform all parties. In all academic grievance appeals, the Vice Chancellor's decision is final and not subject to further appeal within the University. These procedures shall take effect commencing (February 10, 2009) and shall supersede all other academic grievance procedures currently in effect. * Departments may develop their own formal procedures for considering grievances. Such procedures must be co n- sidered and approved by the College Dean and the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, and published on the D e- partment's web site. When such procedures exist, the Department's examination of the grievance will unfold as specified in the procedures. If the Departmental process upholds the st udent's grievance, the Department Chair will work with the College, the student and the instructor to remedy the situation. If the Department does not uphold the grievance, the Chair will report the fact to the Dean. The student may, in such cases, request the College Level review as outlined in these university procedures. Procedures for Alleged Academic Dishonesty or Disruption of Academic Proces s Alleged violations of academic integrity or alleged disruptions of academic process will be handled initially by the instructor, who will discuss the incident with the student. It must be noted that the Faculty Senate considers the tr a- ditional relationsh ip between student and faculty member as the primary means of settling disputes that may arise. If the instructor observes the alleged dishonesty occurring during an examination, he/she should, with discretion, notify the student of the fact before the stu dent leaves the examination. In all cases, the instructor must attempt to schedule a meeting with the student to discuss the alleged dishonesty or disruptions. After the discussion, if the student and instructor have reached a mutual agreement as to the so lution, the instructor shall file a statement with the College Dean, responsible for the course outlining the facts of the incident and the agreed -upon solution signed by both the instructor and student. A copy of this statement shall be given to the stude nt. If no solution is reached, the matter should be referred to the College Dean, for attempt at resolution. Integrity of Students 1. Fundamental principles: Academic integrity is the foundation of the University of South Florida system's (University/USF) commitment to the academic honesty and personal integrity of its University community. Academic integrity is grounded in certain fundamental values, which include honesty, respect and fairness. Broa dly defined, academic honesty is the co m- pletion of all academic endeavors and claims of scholarly knowledge as representative of one's own efforts. Knowledge and maintenance of the academic standards of honesty and integrity as set forth by the University are the responsibility of the entire academic community, including the instructional faculty, staff and students. 2. General Policies: The following policies and procedures apply to all students, instructional faculty and staff who participate in a d- minis tration of academic classes, programs and research at the University of South Florida St. Petersburg. This regulation asserts fairness in that it requires notice to any student accused of a violation of academic integrity and Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures 71 provides a directive for discu ssion between the instructor and student to seek a fair and equitable resolution. If a fair resolution is not accomplished in this discussion, this regulation allows the student continued rights of due process under the academic grievance procedures based upon the preponderance of the evidence. The policies described below are the only policies and procedures that govern violations of academic integrity at the University and s u- persede any previous policies or regulations. 3. Violations of Academic Integrit y: Undergraduate and Graduate Behaviors that violate academic integrity are listed below and are not intended to be all inclusive. (a) Cheating Definition: Cheating is using or attempting to use materials, information, notes, study aids, or other assistance in any type of examination or evaluation which have not been authorized by the instructor. Clarification: 1. Students completing any type of examination or evaluation are prohibited from looking at or transmitting materials to an other student (including electronic reproductions and transmissions) and from using external aids of any sort (e.g. books, notes, calculators, photographic images or conversation with others) unless the instructor has indicated specifically in advance that this will be allowed. 2. Students may not take examinations or evaluations in the place of other persons. Students may not allow other persons to take examinations or evaluations in their places. 3. Students may not acquire unauthorized information abou t an examination or evaluation and may not use any such information improperly acquired by others. 4. Instructors, programs and departments may establish, with the approval of the colleges, additional rules for exam environments and behavior. Such rules m ust be announced in advance in a course syllabus or other a d- vance written notice to students. (b) Plagiarism Definition : Plagiarism is intentionally or carelessly presenting the work of another as one' s own. It includes submitting an assignment purporting to be the student's original work which has wholly or in part been created by another person. It also includes the presentation of the work, ideas, representations, or words of another person without customary and proper acknowledgement of sources. Students must consult with their instructors for clarification in any situation in which the need for documentation is an issue, and will have plagiarized in any situation in which their work is not properly documented. Clarification: 1. Every direct quotation must be identified by quotation marks or appropriate indentation and must be properly acknowledged by parenthetical citation in the text or in a footnote or endnote. 2. When material from another source is paraphrased or summarized in whole or in part in one's own words, that source must be acknowledged in a footnote or endnote, or by parenthetical citation in the text. 3. Information gained in reading or research that is not common professional knowledge must be acknowledged in a parenthetical citation in the text or in a footnote or endnote. 4. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, the use of papers, reports, projects, and other such materials prepared by someone else. (c) Fabrication, Forgery and Obstruction Definitions: Fabrication is the use of invented, counterfeited, altered or forged information in assignments of any type i n- cluding those activities done in conjunction with academic courses that requi re students to be involved in out-of-classroom experiences.

(d) Multiple Submissions Definition: Multiple submissions are the submissions of the same or substantially the same work for credit in two or more courses. Multiple submissions shall include the use of any prior academic effort previously submitted for ac a- demic credit at this or a different institution. Multiple submissions shall not include those situations where the prior written approval by the instructor in the current course is given to the student to use a prior academic work or endeavor. Clarification: 1. Students may not normally submit any academic assignment, work, or endeavor in more than one course for academic credit of any sort. This will apply to submissions of the same or substantially the same work in the same semester or in different semeste rs. 2. Students may not normally submit the same or substantially the same work in two different classes for academic credit even if the work is being graded on different bases in t he separate courses (e.g. graded for research effort and content versus grammar and spelling). 3. Students may resubmit a prior academic endeavor if there is substantial new work, research, or other appr o- priate additional effort. The student shall disclos e the use of the prior work to the instructor and receive the instructor's permission to use it PRIOR to the submission of the current endeavor. 4. Students may submit the same or substantially the same work in two or more courses with the prior written permission of all faculty involved. Instructors will specify the expected academic effort applicable to their courses and the overall endeavor shall reflect the same or additional academic effort as if separate assignments were submitted in each course. Fai lure by the student to obtain the written permission of each instructor shall be considered a multiple submission. (e) Complicity Definition: Complicity is assisting or attempting to assist another person in any act of academic dishonesty. Clarification : 1. Students may not allow other students to copy from their papers during any type of examination. 2. Students may not assist other students in acts of academic dishonesty by providing material of any kind that one may have reason to believe will be mis represented to an instructor or other University official. 3.

(4) Violations and Sanctions for Undergraduate Students:1 Violations for undergraduate students at the University of South Florida St. Petersburg are classified into four le vels according to the nature of the infraction. For each level of violation a corresponding set of sanctions is reco m- mended, however, specific academic programs may include additional and different sanctions. These sanctions are intended as general guideli nes for the academic community with examples cited below for each level of violation. These examples are not to be considered all -inclusive. It is recommended that the instructor forward a concise written statement describing the academic dishonesty of an incident with its particulars to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs for violations in Levels Two through Four. These records will be ma intained until graduation or until they are of no further administrative value. This will enable better handling of multiple violations. (a) Level One Violations Level One violations may occur because of inexperience or lack of knowledge of principles of a cademic integrity on the part of persons committing the violation. These violations address incidents when intent is questionable and are likely to involve a small fraction of the total course work, are not extensive, and/or occur on a minor assignment. Th e following are examples: 1. Working with another student on a laboratory or other homework assignment when such work is prohibited. 2. Failure to footnote or give proper acknowledgment in an extremely limited section of an assignment. Recommended sanctio ns for Level One violations are listed below : Reduction or no credit given for the original assignment. An assigned paper or research project on a relevant topic. A make -up assignment at a more difficult level than the original assignment. Required attend ance in a non -credit workshop or seminar on ethics or related subjects. (b) Level Two Violations Level Two violations are characterized by dishonesty of a more serious character or that which affects a more si g- nificant aspect or portion of the course work . The following are examples: 1. Quoting directly or paraphrasing, to a moderate extent, without acknowledging the source. 2. Submitting the same work or major portions thereof to satisfy the requirements of more than one course without permission from the instructor. 3. Using data or interpretative material for a laboratory report without acknowledging the sources or the co l- laborators. All contributors to preparation of data and/or to writing the report must be named. 4. Receiving assistance from others, such as research, statistical, computer programming, or field data collection help that constitutes an essential element in the undertaking without acknowledging such assistance in a paper, examination or project. Recommended sanctions for Level Two violations are listed below : 74Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures Failing grade for the assignment involved with the grade in the course determined in the normal manner. Failing grade for the course, which may be an \"F\" or \"FF\" on the internal transcript. (c) Level Three Violations Level Three violations are those that go beyond Level One or Two violations and that affect a major or essential portion of work done to meet course requirements, or involve premeditation, or are preceded by one or more vi o- lations at Levels One and/or Two. Examples include: 1. Copying on examinations. 2. Plagiarizing major portions of a written assignment. 3. Acting to facilitate copy ing during an exam. 4. Using prohibited materials, e.g. books, notes, or calculators during an examination. 5. Collaborating before an exam to develop methods of exchanging information and implementation thereof. 6. Altering examinations for the purposes of regrading. 7. Acquiring or distributing an examination from unauthorized sources prior to the examination. 8. Presenting the work of another as one's own. 9. Using purchased term paper or other materials. 10. Removing posted or reserved material, or preventing other students from having access to it. 11. Fabricating data by inventing or deliberately altering material (this includes citing \"sources\" that are not, in fact, sources. 12. Using unethical or improp er means of acquiring data. Recommended sanctions for Level Three violations are listed below : Failing grade for the course with a designation of \"FF\" on student's internal transcript. Possible suspension from the University for one semester. (d) Level Four Violations Level Four violations represent the most serious breaches of intellectual honesty. Examples of Level Four violations include: 1. All academic infractions committed after return from suspension for a previous academic honesty viol ation. 2. Infractions of academic honesty in ways similar to criminal activity (such as forging a grade form, stealing an examination from a professor or from a University office; buying an examination; or falsifying a transcript to secure entry into the U niversity or change the record of work done at the University) . 3. Having a substitute take an examination or taking an examination for someone else. 4. Fabrication of evidence, falsification of data, quoting directly or paraphrasing without acknowledgi ng the source, and/or presenting the ideas of another as one's own in a senior thesis, within a master's thesis or doctoral dissertation, in scholarly articles submitted to refereed journals, or in other work represented as one's own as a graduate student. 5. Sabotaging another student's work through actions designed to prevent the student from successfully co m- pleting an assignment. 6. Willful violation of a canon of the ethical code of the profession for which a student is preparing. Recommended sanctio ns for Level Four violations are listed below : The typical sanction for all Level Four violations is permanent academic dismissal from the University with the designation of \"Dismissed for Academic Dishonesty\" to be placed permanently on a student's extern al transcript. (5) Additional Undergraduate Guidelines for Academic Dishonesty: (a) Grade Assignment 1. An \"FF\" grade assigned to indicate academic dishonesty is reflected only on internal records and prevents the student from repeating the course using the Grade Forgiveness Policy. Students with any \"FF\" grade on record will not be eligible for honors at graduation. 2. If a student who has been accused of academic dishonesty drops the course, the student's registration in the course wil l be reinstated until the issue is resolved. 3. Any assigned grade may be changed to an \"FF\", \"F\", or other grade depending on the instructor's decision or the ultimate resolution of an academic grievance procedure. This includes any instance of academic dishonesty that is not detected by the instructor until after the student has dropped or completed the course. Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures 75 4. Notification to the student of the \"FF\" grade and the option of appeal concerning the alleged academic di s- honesty shall be the responsibility of the instructor and/or department chair (See Student Academic Grievance Procedures). 5. Notice that a student has been dismissed for reasons of academic dishonesty will be reflected on the student's transcript with the formal notation: Dismissed for Ac ademic Dishonesty. 6. More serious violations of academic integrity may be referred to the Office of Students Rights and Respons i- bilities as a student conduct violation. (b) Multiple Violations: 1. For the first \"FF\" recorded in an undergraduate student 's USF academic record, the student will receive a letter from the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs informing him or her of being placed on \"Academic Dishonesty Warning\" for the remainder of enrollment at USF and of appeal rights for the \"FF\" grade. 2. For the second \"FF\" recorded, the undergraduate student will be suspended for one full semester and readmitted only after writing a clear statement indicating remorse, understanding of the seriousness of the offense, and understanding of the importance of integrity in all areas, including academic work. A letter informing him or her of this action and appeal rights will be sent from the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. 3. For the third \"FF\" recorded, the undergraduate student will be permanently dismissed f rom the University for violations of academic integrity and with notice of that dismissal as a part of the formal record and transcript. 4. The maximum penalty for receipt of any \"FF\" grade may be permanent dismissal from the University for v i- olations of a cademic integrity and with a notice of that dismissal as a part of the student's formal record and transcript. (6) Violations and Sanctions for Graduate Students:2 The Graduate School holds academic integrity in the highest regard. Graduate students are r esponsible for being aware of and complying with University Regulations and Policies and must conduct themselves accordingly. Sanctions for Academic Dishonesty will depend on the seriousness of the offense and may range from the receipt of: An \"F\" or \"Zer o\" grade on the subject paper, lab report, etc. An \"F\" in the course or activity in which credit may be earned. An \"FF\" in the course (leading to expulsion from the University). Academic Dismissal for any violations of academic dishonesty policies or regulations. Possible revocation of the degree or Graduate Certificate following a thorough investigation. Graduate students who are assigned an \"FF\" grade will be academically dismi ssed from the University and will not be eligible to apply to any graduate program at USF. Procedures regarding Academic Dishonesty and Academic Dismissal may be found on the Graduate School website. (7) Additional Graduate Guidelines for Academic Dishones ty: 1. If a graduate student who has been accused of academic dishonesty drops the course, the student's registration in the course will be reinstated until the issue is resolved. 2. Any assigned grade may be changed to an \"FF\", \"F\", or other grade depen ding on the instructor's decision or the ultimate resolution of an academic grievance procedure. This includes any instance of academic dishonesty that is not detected until after the student has dropped or completed the course. 3. Notification to the gra duate student of the \"FF\" grade and the option of appeal concerning the alleged academic dishonesty and academic dismissal remains with the instructor and/or department chair (See Student Academic Grievance Procedures). 4. A graduate student who has been dismissed for reasons of academic dishonesty will have this reflected on the student's transcript with the formal notation: Dismissed for Academic Dishonesty. 5. More serious violations of academic integrity may be referred to the Office of Students Right s and Respons i- bilities as a student conduct violation. (8) Appeals: Undergraduate and Graduate Once the initial violation of the academic integrity regulation has been documented and fairly discussed by the student and the instructor, the student may appeal the instructor's decision that a violation has occurred. At that point the student will follow the procedures outlined in the University of South Florida's student Academic Grievanc e Procedure Policy. For academic integrity violations that are reviewed at the department and college levels, the respective committees will consider all evidence available to determine if the instructor's decision was correct. The student's ability to pro ceed within an academic program while an Academic Grievance is in process will be dete r- mined by the individual academic program chair/director. 1 These policies apply to Undergraduate Students, even if taking graduate coursework. Graduate students are students admitted to a graduate degree program or graduate certificate, and/or non -degree seeking students taking graduate coursework (such students should refer to Section IV Violations and Sanctions fo r Graduate Students) 76Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures 2 These policies apply to Graduate Students (students admitted to a graduate degree program or graduate certificate, and/or non -degree seeking students taking graduate coursework). Undergraduate students should refer to Section III Violations and Sanctions for Undergraduate Students) Authority: Art. IX, Sec. 7, Fla. Constitution and Resolutions issued by the FL Board of Governors History -New 12 -11-08. Disruption of Academ ic Process (1) Disruptive students in the academic setting hinder the educational process. Although disruptive student conduct is already prohibited by the University of South Florida system (University/USF) Student Code of Conduct, the purpose of this re gulation is to clarify what constitutes disruptive behavior in the academic setting; what actions faculty and relevant academic officers may take in response to disruptive conduct; and the authority of the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (or designated office handling conduct issues in Student Affairs) to initiate separate disciplinary proceedings against students for disruptive conduct. (2) Disruption of the academic process is defined as the act, words, or general conduct of a student in a classroom or other academic environment which in the reasonable estimation of the instructor: (a) Directs attention away from the academic matters at hand, such as noisy distractions, persistent, disrespectful or abusive interruption of lecture, exam, aca demic discussion, or general University operations, or (b) Presents a danger to the health, safety or well -being of self or other persons. References to classroom or academic area include all academic settings (live or online, and including field exper i- ences). References to Instructor include the course instructor, USF St. Petersburg faculty, administrators, and staff. Misconduct occurring in other campus areas on University premises or which adversely affects the University community and/or the pursuit o f its mission is already prohibited by the Student Code of Conduct and will be handled by those procedures. Academic discussion that includes disagreement with the course instructor during times when the instructor permits discussion is not in itself disru ptive behavior and is not prohibited. Some disruptive students may have emotional or mental health disorders. Although such students may be considered disabled and are protected under the Rehabilitation Act/ADA, they are held to the same standards of condu ct as any student. The following applies to all campuses of the University of South Florida system; however, non -substantive procedural modifications to reflect the particular circumstances of each separately accredited USF System institution are permitted . Information concerning these procedures is available through the Student Affairs Office. (3) Procedures for Handling Disruption of Academic Process. (a) General Guidelines for Instructor: 1. If a student is disruptive, the Instructor may ask the student to stop the disruptive behavior and/or warn the student that such disruptive behavior can result in academic and/or disciplinary action. Alleged disruptions of the academic process will be handled initially by the Instructor, who will discuss the incident with the student whenever possible. It must be noted that the Faculty Senate considers the traditional relationship between student and instructor as the primary means of settling disputes that may arise. 2. The Instructor is authorized to ask a student to leave the classroom or academic area and desist from the disruptive behavior if the Instructor deems it necessary. If the Instructor does this, s/he will send an Academic Disruption Incident Report withi n 48 hours simultaneously to: a. The department chair, b. The Assistant/Associate Dean of the College (as determined by the College), c. The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR) or the separately accredited institution's/regional campus' designated office in Student Affairs, and d. The student. If the situation is deemed an emergency or circumstances require more immediate action, the instructor should notify the appropriate law enforcement agency, OSRR and other authorities as soon as possible. Any filed Incident Report can, and should, be updated if new information pertinent to the situation is obtained. 3. An Instructor may also further exclude the student from the classroom or other academic area pending res o- lution of the matter. If the Instructor recommends exclusion (temporary or permanent) from the classroom pending resolution, the student must be informed of the exclusion before the next scheduled class (either by phone, email or in person). That notice must: a. Inform the stude nt of the exclusion, b. Inform the student of his/her right to request an expedited review of the exclusion within two days to the Chair of the Department. Grades , Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures 77 If such academic exclusion occurs, and if the student requests a review, the Chair of the Departme nt shall review the exclusion within two days of the date the student requests the review and decide if the student can return to the specific class and/or any academic setting. This decision may be appealed in writing by the student within two (2) days to the Dean of the college or the institutional designee (as appropriate) for review and decision within two days. Any decision rendered at that point must be in writing and will serve as the final and binding academic decision of the University. Each academ ic decision or sanction must be communicated to the Office of Students Rights and Responsibilities or the separately accredited institution's/regional campus' designated office as soon as possible. (b) Possible Academic Sanctions and Grading Guidelines: Authority of an Instructor and the appropriate Chair or Assistant/Associate Dean may result in any of the following sanctions: Warning to the student. Voluntary withdrawal by the student from the class(es). Temporary exclusion and/or permanent dismissal from the instructor's classroom or academic area, program, or college, pending an expedited appeal. Academic sanction, including assignment of a final grade. -- If the final determination is a dismissal from c lass, the grade assigned for the class will depend on the student's status at the time of dismissal. If the student had a passing grade in the class at the time of dismissal, a grade of \"W\" will be assigned for the course. If the student had a failing grad e in the class at the time of dismissal, a grade of \"F\" will be assigned for the course. These grades will become a part of the student's permanent record. In addition, if the academic disruption results in dismissal from more than the classroom or academi c area of the incident, this grading policy may be applied in all classes affected. (c) Documentation and Academic Disruption Incident Report: Instructors should be aware that notes of the dates, times, witnesses and details of the incidents of disruption and the impact of the disruption on those present may be important in any future proceedings which may be ne c- essary. Referrals to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or designated office in Student Affairs r e- quire written documentation conta ining factual and descriptive information. The student is entitled to see this documentation. The Academic Disruption Incident Report must be submitted by hardcopy (not email) simultaneously within 48 hours to: 1. The department chair, 2. The Assistant/A ssociate Dean of the College (as determined by the College), 3. The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or the separately accredited institution's regional campus' designated office in Student Affairs, and 4. The student. The form can be downl oaded from the designated website in Student Affairs or completed by way of mem o- randum containing the following information: Date of report Student's name Student name Instructor's Instructor's -mail Title of course, course number and section Date/time/location of incident Detailed summary of the incident, including a description of the disruptive behavior Witnesses Action, if any, taken by the instructor (e.g., student warned, asked to leave the class , etc.) Recommended course of action and reasons for this recommendation Instructor's signature (d) Possible Disciplinary Sanctions for Conduct by the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities: Upon receipt of the Academic Disruption Incident Report or other academic referral for disruptive conduct, the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or designated office in Student Affairs may initiate the disciplinary 78Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures process resulting in the impo sition of any of the following sanctions in addition to any academic sanctions imposed (in section b): Educational sanctions to include but not limited to educational programs/classes and written assignment Disciplinary probation Provisional suspension Suspension Restriction from certain or all class(es), program, college, residence hall, or any part or all of USF System institutions. Expulsion When an incident is being reviewed by OSRR or designated office in Student Affairs for possible disciplinary sanctions, current provisions affecting the student's academic status (temporary or otherwise) will be comm u- nicated by the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or designated office in Student Affairs to the I n- structor and appropriate academic adminis trators/instructors responsible for the student's current academic standing as soon as possible, but within two weeks of the reported incident. Only final disciplinary sanctions that affect the academic status of the student will be communicated to the Ins tructor(s) and appropriate academic administrators after the disciplinary process is complete.

Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures 79 Although post -secondary foreign language courses may not be required for all graduates, stud ents are encouraged to become competent in at least one foreign language. Foreign language study enriches the command of English, enlarges cultural perspective, and enhances learning skills. Liberal Arts General Education Course Requirements (36 Semester Hours) A. English Composition: B. This requirement consists of a minimum of six (6) semester h ours of approved course work in English Composition. Students may satisfy this requirement during the second semester freshman level of composition in the following ways: by earning a letter grade of \"C -\" or better at USF St. Petersburg or another institut ion or by receiving AP or IB English credit. C. Quantitative Methods: Competence in a minimum of six (6) semester hours of approved mathematics coursework (see the list below). These courses should include both a practical component -providing students with an appreciation of how course content relates to their everyday experiences, and an historical component -providing students with an understanding of the application of the material to other disciplines. To satisfy the Gordon Rule, students must earn a lett er grade of \"C -\" or better in each of these courses. Only the courses in the list below may be used to satisfy the General Education Quantitative Methods requirement. At least one course must have either an MAC or an MGF prefix. The other course may be any course in the list. D. Natural Sciences: Students should successfully complete a minimum of six (6) semester hours of approved coursework in the natural sciences. Students are encouraged to enroll in courses with a laboratory component. It is a goal that all students have at least one science course with a laboratory; however, facilities and personnel resources prohibit that requirement at this time. Courses may be interdisciplinary. The courses may deal with the content, theories, history, presu p- positions , and methods of the discipline. They will include demonstrations and address problems, ambiguities, and different perspectives in the discipline. They will also provide students with an appreciation of how the discipline fits within the natural sciences a nd relates to their own lives and the broader human experience. E. Social Sciences: Students must successfully complete a minimum of six (6) semester hours of approved coursework in the social sciences; the courses may be interdisciplinary and need not be sequential. Courses in the social sciences shall involve those disciplines considered to be social sciences in that they deal theoretically and empirically with individuals and their relationships to each other and to society. Courses must deal with the co ntent, theories, history, presuppos i- tions, and methods of the discipline. They should also address problems, ambiguities, and different perspectives in the discipline. These courses will provide students with an appreciation of how the discipline fits with in the social sciences and relates to their own lives and the broader human experience. F.

Liberal Arts Exit Requirements for Undergraduates in all Disciplines (9 Semester Hours) A student's liberal arts education will continue throughout the college years and not be limi ted to a relatively small number of required courses in the first two years of college. Exit requirements will provide students with an opportunity during their junior and senior years at USF St. Petersburg to integrate their knowledge within the context o f liberal arts. Courses that satisfy the exit requirements will, where appropriate, incorporate considerations of values and ethics; international and environmental perspectives; race and ethnicity; and gender. By their junior and senior years, students will have a foundation in liberal arts and be better able to reflect upon ethical issues in a constructive way. Students seeking second baccalaureate degrees (those coded as 5B) are exempt from the liberal arts exit requirements. Students will take at least one of the Liberal Arts Exit courses outside their disciplinary cluster(s). For purposes of this policy, the term \"discipline\" refers to the following fields: business, education, fine arts, letters, natural sciences, and social sciences (See list below of \"Outside the Disciplinary Cluster\" Liberal Arts Exit Courses). One of the Major Works and Major Issues courses, if taken outside the student's major disciplinary cluster(s), may be taken for S/U credit with the consent of the instructor. Only courses numb ered 3000 or above may be used to satisfy the exit requirements. Exit requirements must be completed with USF St. Petersburg courses. All exit requirement courses will be seminar -size courses in which enrollment will be targeted at approximately 20 to 25 students. These courses will be taught by regular faculty. Students majoring in the College of Education are permitted to graduate with only six credits of Liberal Arts Exit courses, all of which may be taken in the College. The distribution of those six credits varies by major. I. Major Works and Major Issues (6 credit hours require d): A portion of the exit requirements consists of a minimum of six (6) semester hours of approved coursework co n- cerning major works and major issues. Courses will focus on major issues, documents, or works, and will allow students to read primary texts. These courses may allow students to delve into topics on an interdisciplinary basis. Students will be encouraged to write enough to fulfill Gordon Rule requirements. One of the Major Works and Major Issues courses, if taken outside the student's major disc ipline(s), may be taken for S/U credit with the consent of the instructor. Major Works and Major Issues courses must offer the opportunity for integration of content. These courses will have a liberal arts content and, when appropriate, will contain in -depth discussions of values and ethics, international and environmental perspectives, race and ethnicity, and gender. Courses may be interdisciplinary and may be team taught. This will provide students with an opportunity to explore, in -depth and on an interd isciplinary basis, major topics that are important but outside of the major field of study. J. Literature and Writing (3 credit hours required): In addition, students will take three (3) semester hours of approved exit requirement coursework in literature and writing. These courses will allow students to read significant literature of the world and write at least 6,000 words. These courses also meet the Gordon Rule Communications requirement. The writing requirement may be satisfied with assig nments that include, for instance, revision and process writing. The course may be taken within the major if appropriate. The courses will focus on the dimensions of values and ethics, international and environmental perspectives, race and ethnicity, and g ender. All courses listed are certified as meeting the Exit requirement. Additional courses may have been certified since publication of this catalog.

Students with majors from one cluster, must take at least one certified Liberal Arts Exit course from any of the other clusters iden tified below. Disciplinary Cluster 1: Arts & Letters - Students with majors in these programs must take at least one certified Liberal Arts Exit course in Clusters 2 -6. Mass Communications with Journalism and Media Studies Concentration 84Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures English World Langu ages and Cultures Disciplinary Cluster 2: Natural Sciences - Students with majors in these programs must take at least one certified Liberal Arts Exit courses in Clusters 1 or 3 -6. Environmental Science and Policy Biology Health Sciences Disciplinary Clust er 3: Social Sciences - Students with majors in these programs must take at least one certified Liberal Arts Exit course in Clusters 1, 2or 4 -6.

Art-Graphic Design Disciplinary Cluster 6: Education Education -By app roved exception, students majoring in this program will take 6 hours of exit in the College of Education. Freshman English Requirement All first -time-in-college students are required to take Freshman English (a sequential two -semester course of study) in accordance with the following conditions: 1. First-time-enrolled students (a) who do not intend to take the CLEP Freshm an English Test or (b) who have been notified of failing CLEP prior to registration and who do not intend to attempt the exam a second time must take ENC 1101 and ENC 1102 sequentially. If a student fails the first course, he/she must repeat it before proc eeding to the next Freshman English course. Students should normally take these courses during their freshman year, but these courses are high demand and it is possible that registration space will not always be available. 2. First-time-enrolled students (a) who have not taken CLEP prior to their arrival on campus or (b) who have failed but wish to repeat the test should attempt CLEP during their first nine (9) weeks. During this semester, they should not enroll in ENC 1101 . If a student either fails or doesn 't attempt the CLEP examination during his/her first nine (9) weeks, the student normally should take ENC 1101 in the following semester. In this case, the student will normally complete the sequence by the first semester of his/her sophomore year. These p olicies do not apply to first -time-enrolled students who can meet the Freshman English requirement with credit transferred from another institution or those with appropriate AP or IB English credit. Credi t by Examination A student who feels he/she has already acquired the basic content of a course on his/her approved schedule should inquire about credit -by-examination. Some exams are offered through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP). Interested students should obtain additional information from their advisors or the USF System Office of Evaluation and Testing. Baccalaureate Degree - University Requirements 85 University minimum requirements for graduation consist of the following: earn a minimum of 120 semester hours with an overall 2.00 GPA, including a 2.00 GPA in all courses attempted at within the USF System; a transfer student must have a GPA of 2.0 or higher when combined with all work attempted at other institutions; satisfactorily complete writing and computation course requirements of 6A -10.030; earn a minimum of 48 semester hours of upper -level work (cour ses numbered 3000 and above); complete Liberal Arts requirements; complete the USF St. Petersburg residency requir e- ment; complete program requirements as determined by the department and/or college; and be recommended for graduation by the dean of the appr opriate college. The requirements must be met by every student upon whom a degree is conferred. The total number of semester hours needed to complete the baccalaureate degree depends upon the academic major field of study. No grades may be changed followin g graduation. In recognition that students seeking a second Bachelor's degree have completed a rigorous program of study at a r e- gionally accredited or comparable international institution, some graduation requirements are considered met by virtue of their previous degree. These include: Gordon Rule, Summer Enrollment, the Foreign Language Entrance Requirement, General Education and the Exit Requirements. Each degree program will determine degree applicability of transfer courses for the major. All students entering USF St. Petersburg with fewer than 60 semester hours of credit are required to earn at least 9 semester hours of credit prior to graduation by attendance during one or more summer semesters. Summer Enrollment Requirement All students entering the University with fewer than 60 semester hours of college level academic work are required to earn at least 9 semester hours during one or more Summer terms prior to graduation. Foreign Language Graduation Requirement for B.A. Students In addition to the foreign language entrance requirement all students applying for a Bachelor of Arts degree from USF St. Petersburg must demonstrate competency in a foreign language. To demonstrate this competency, students may take either two semesters of a beginning college -level foreign language or one semester of a higher -level course and earn a letter grade of \"C -\" (no \" S\" grades) or above in the appropriate level course or demonstrate equivalent competency by passing an examination. Languages offered at USF St. Petersburg include: Spanish French Sign Language Transfer credit for languages other than those listed above ma y be applied toward the B.A. foreign language r e- quirement. Please see your academic advisor for further information. American Sign Language Approval needed by the student's program/department major. The following programs accept Sign Language Comp e- tency for the exit requirement:, Anthropology, Criminology, Economics, History, Interdisciplinary Social Sciences, Mass Communications with Journalism and Media Studies Concentrations, Political Science, Psychol ogy . . Students taking the placement examination in French or Spanish should view the World Languages website at http://www.stpt.usf.edu/coas/languages/Placement_test.htm for test dates and times. Foreign Language Placement Students with two or more years of study in a foreign language in high school, or with postsecondary course(s) in foreign language, or with experiential learning of a foreign language may not enroll for credit in courses in that l anguage without first taking a placement examination administered by World Language Education. Should the placement e x- amination indicate that remedial work is required (1120 -1121), the student will be allowed to enroll with the unde r- standing that the grade eventually earned will be either an \"S\" or \"U.\" Under no circumstances will a student who places above the first year level or who passes a higher -level course be allowed to register for or receive credit for a lower -level course in that specific language . Students to whom this re g- ulation applies should inquire of the Department of World Languages for the placement examination. Academic Residency USF Regulation 3.007 BACCALAUREATE DEGREE - UNIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS 86Baccalaureate Degree - University Requirements Any credits transferred from a University of South Florida accredited institution must be processed as transfer credits from any regionally accredited institution. Candidates for graduation must have completed at least 30 hours of the last 60 hours of the ir undergraduate credits in courses offered by the USF System Institution (home institution) from which the degree is to be conferred. Individual colleges and programs may have more stringent requirements, approved by the university, such as the number of spe- cific courses in the major that must be completed at the institution from which a student may receive a degree. Ex- ceptions to the above rules may be made for students who are enrolled at other universities in USF approved exchanges, study abroad progr ams, co -op training programs or correspondence courses from the University of Florida. CLEP credit does not count toward academic residence. Beginning Fall semester 2012, students must successfully complete at least 50 percent of the required courses in the major in courses offered by the USF System Institution conferring the degree. In cases of hardship or lack of course availability, individual exceptions may be approved by the respective College Deans or designee to help ensure timely graduation.

Academic Minor In addition to major programs, some departments offer an academic minor that requires approximately one -half the upper -level credits required for a major. Students interested in a particular minor should obtain the specific r e- quirements from the appropriate department. The department may require the same admission or retention standards as required for the major. Baccalaureate Degree - University Requirements 87 Each academic minor conforms to the Universit y requirements: 1. A minimum of 8 semester hours of credit used to satisfy the requirements of a minor must be from USF St. Petersburg courses. 2. A student desiring a minor must have a major in a different program option. Some departments d o not apply courses toward both the major and the minor. See your academic advisor to confirm eligibility for course dual application. 3. USF St. Petersburg coursework for a minor must have a GPA of at least 2.0. 4. Only an undergraduate degree -seeking student a t USF St. Petersburg is eligible for a minor. 5. A minor can be applied for and received only in conjunction with applying for and receiving a baccalaureate degree except for students who have already received a baccalaureate degree from a USF System institut ion who may earn certification of a minor by taking additional undergraduate coursework at the University and applying for the ce r- tification.

Please check the university -wide catalog for specific details. Academic Learning Compacts In accordance with the Board of Governors Policy Guideline #PG 05.02.15 each baccalaureate program develops and implements \"Academic Learning Compacts.\" The Academic Learning Compacts include concise statem ents of what program graduates will know and be able to do (i.e. the expected core student learning outcomes). Each Academic Learning Compact includes the following components: Identifies the expected core student learning outcomes for program graduates i n the areas of: Content/discipline knowledge and skills. Communication skills. Critical thinking skills. The Academic Learning Compacts are posted on each program's USF St. Petersburg website and will be provided to students when they begin their degree programs and are advised in their declared majors. 88Baccalaureate Degree - University Requirements Student's Choice of Catalog In order to graduate from USF St. Petersburg, each degree -seeking student must meet all of the graduation requirements specified in the USF St. Petersburg catalog of his/her choice. A degree -seeking student may choose any USF St. P e- tersburg catalog published during his/her continuous enrollment. Students who have transferred from one Florida public institution to another a re affected by this policy: Graduation requirements in effect at the receiving SUS institution at the time a student enrolls at a Florida public institution of higher learning shall apply to that student in the same manner that graduation requirements appl y to its native students provided the student has had continuous enrollment as defined in the SUS institution's catalog. At USF St. Petersburg, continuous enrollment is defined as enrolling as a degree seeking student at least one term each twelve month pe riod. Therefore, students cannot choose a USF St. Petersburg catalog published prior to or during an academic year in which they did not maintain continuous enrollment. (Each catalog is considered to be published during the academic year printed on the tit le page.) If the student cannot meet all of the graduation requirements specified in the catalog of his/her choice due to university decisions and changes in policy matter, course offering, etc., appropriate substitutions will be determined by the dean of the college of the student's major. USF St. Petersburg's policies are subject to change and apply to all students regardless of their choice of catalog. If the student's graduation requirements are affected by changes in University policies, appropriate ar rangements will be made to preclude penalization of the student. Repeat Course Work The hours for a course that has been repeated may be counted only once toward the minimum 120 semester hours of credit (ear ned hours) required for graduation. All credit hours (except when grade forgiveness is applied) are calculated in the GPA (See Repeat Course Surcharges.) Undergraduate Degrees USF St. Petersburg awards th ree undergraduate degrees. They are the Bachelor of Sciences, the Bachelor of Arts, and the Bachelor of Fine Arts. Double Undergraduate Major Students may elect to graduate with two majors within the same undergraduate degree. In that event, they must apply independently to each department/college and be assigned an advisor for each discipline. The student must meet all requirements of each major separately, must be certified for graduation by both ma jors and meet all of the university requirements for the degree. The student will earn the appropriate bachelors degree with two majors indicated and receive one diploma. Second Undergraduate Major A student who wishes to work for a second undergraduate major, after receipt of a baccalaureate degree from USF St. Petersburg, must apply through the Office of Undergraduate Admissions to re -enroll and then meet the major r e- quirements as determined by the department/college. (Exceptions to this rule are students who had been previously accepted for a \"Double Undergraduate Major\" but graduated with only one major.) After acceptance by the appropriate college and proof of completion, the student's \"permanent academic record\" will be posted accordingly.* * Note that those students who complete the requirements for a second major must be aware that they will not receive a second degree nor will they receive a second diploma. Double Undergraduate Degree (USF St. Petersburg Students) A USF St. Petersburg student may earn more than one baccalaureate degree (i.e., B.A., B.F.A., B.S.) concurrently, if he/she meets the following re quirements: Earns a minimum of 150 credit hours, including a minimum of 60 hours in residence at USF St. Petersburg. Meets all major requirements for both disciplines and all university requirements for both degree programs. Meets all prerequisite and cou rse requirements in two different major fields. Second Undergraduate Degree (USF System Students) Students who wish to work for a second degree after receipt of a baccalaureate degree from a USF System institution, must apply through the Office of Undergraduate Admissions to re -enroll at USF St. Petersburg and then meet the major requirements as determ ined by the department/college as well as the university requirements for the degree. Upon completion and certification, the student will receive a second degree and a second diploma. Baccalaureate Degree - University Requirements 89 Post -Bac Degree (Transfer Students) A student who has previously earned a bachelor's degree from an accredited four -year institution (not within the USF System) and wishes to pursue further undergraduate work may apply for admission for the second degree. If acc epted, the student: Must earn a minimum of 30 additional credit hours at USF St. Petersburg. Meet all degree and College graduation requirements for the second degree program in the catalog under which he or she enters, or in a subsequent catalog. Meet al l prerequisite and course requirements in the major field(s) for the second degree. Application for Graduation In order to graduate, a student must submit an on -line application for the bachelor's degree or Associate in Arts ce r- tificate through the student's OASIS account. This application must be submitted in the term of expected graduation by the deadline noted in the academic calendar for the student to be assured of availability of academic regalia for pa r- ticipation in the graduation ceremony, certification of graduation by the end of the term, inclusion of name in the graduation Bulletin, and timely ordering of the diploma. Students w ho submit the application for graduation after the posted deadline but prior to the last day of classes for the academic term and who are determined to have met all graduation requirements in that semester may have their graduation posted that term. Studen ts must note that a late application may not be processed before the next term's registration period if they have not met all degree requir e- ments. Applications received after the last day of classes will result in the graduation being posted at the end of the following academic term. If a student applies for graduation and is not approved, a new application for degree must be submitted by the deadline in a new term. In order for the degree statement to appear on a student's academic record, the student must file the aforementioned application whether or not participation in the commencement ceremony is desired. Inquiries concerning approval or denial of graduation should be made to the Academic Advising Center, DAV 134. It is the student's responsibility to clear all \"I\" grades (incompletes) in courses required for graduation and to provide official transcripts of all transferred course work needed for graduation at least 3 weeks prior to the end of the term in which he/she expects to graduate. A student appl ying for a second undergraduate major must do so within the same deadline set for applying for a degree. A student applying for a minor must: 1. File a separate request for certification for the minor during the semester of graduation; 2. Apply for the minor on the \"Application for Degree,\" listing both the minor and the college responsible for the minor on the application; and 3. Have no \"I\" grade in required courses. Posth umous Degrees or Degrees in Memoriam The University may award a posthumous baccalaureate and master's degree to a student who was in good standing at the University at the time of his or her death and who had completed all substantive requirements for the degree. The University may also award baccalaureate and master's degrees in memoriam to a student who was in good standing at the University at the time of his or her death. To award a non -thesis degree, the student would need to have completed all courses required for the degree. Courses required for the degree, in which the student is enrolled at the time of his or her death, must have been completed to the satisfaction of the faculty so that passing grades might be posted. All other requirements (e.g., g rade point average, CLAST and other tests) must have been satisfied as well. To award a thesis degree, all courses must be completed as described above and the thesis must be sufficiently complete to the satisfaction of the faculty so that certification of completion may be posted to the student's record. Procedures for Award of Posthumous Degrees or Degrees in Memoriam The chairperson of a department, on his or her own initiative or upon the request of the family of the student, may recommend a posthumous degree, or a degree in memoriam, by forwarding the recommendation to the respective dean of the college. If approved by the Dean, the recommendation with suppor ting documentation will be forwarded to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs for approval. If the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs approves the reco m- mendation, the Office of the Registrar will be notified and the degree will be awarded at the next commencement ceremony or will be presented to the student's family in an appropriate setting. Diplomas for posthumous degrees will be identical to other degrees awarded in the same colleges and majors. Diplomas for Degrees in Memoriam will be prepared to r ead \"Bachelor of Arts in Memoriam, Bachelor of Science in Memoriam,\" Master of Arts in Memoriam,\" etc., depending upon the degree the student was pursuing at the time of his or her death. 90Baccalaureate Degree - University Requirements Undergraduate students who have not chosen a major at the time of de ath will be awarded the \"Bachelor of Arts in Memoriam.\" Honors at Graduation To be considered for honors at graduation, a baccalaureate candidate must have completed at least 40 credits of graded upper level work at a USF System Institution and have earned a grade point average of 3.50 or higher for all graded coursework attempted at a USF System Institution. For those students in programs requiring multiple clinical exper i- ences (such as Education), a baccalaureate candidate must have completed at least 30 hours of graded upper level coursework and have earned a grade point average of 3.5 or higher for all graded coursework attempted at a USF System Institution. In addition, to be eligible for honors, transfer students and USF St. Petersburg students who have postsecondary work elsewhere must have an overall GPA of 3.50 or higher cou nting all USF System courses as well as all transferable work attempted at other institutions. The forgiveness policy at USF or other institutions and plus/minus grades awarded at other institutions will not be applicable in computing the GPA for honors. I n addition, students with a record of academic dishonesty appearing on any transcripts will not be eligible for honors at graduation. Candidates with a USF System GPA of 3.50 or higher and an overall GPA of 3.50 but below 3.70 shall receive a diploma desig nation of cum laude (with honor). Candidates with a USF System GPA of 3.50 or higher and an overall GPA of 3.70 but below 3.90 shall receive a diploma designation of magna cum laude (with high honor). Candidates with a USF System GPA of 3.50 or higher and an overall GPA of 3.90 or above shall receive a diploma de s- ignation of summa cum laude (with highest honor). In addition, each dean has the option to select on the basis of exceptional achievement 1% o f the college's graduates or 1 student per semester for graduating with distinction . [For purposes of honors recognition at the commencement ceremony, students must have a 3.50 GPA before the term in which they plan to graduate to have honors recognized pu blicly at the commencement ceremony.] NOTE: The GPA is not rounded up when determining honors at graduation (e.g., 3.69 is not the same as 3.70). Commencement USF St. Petersburg schedules two Commencement Convocat ions for USF graduates each year (Spring and Fall). After students have applied for their degree, early in the semester in which they intend to graduate, they may register to participate in the ceremony online at http://usfweb2.usf.edu/commencement/registe r/ceremony_reg.asp This website will answer many of the questions with respect to graduate participation in the ceremony, including cap and gown ordering, honors and international sashes, graduate studies, career counseling, USF alumni association and deadlines. Please read this information carefully and completely. Commencement is an exciting time for all graduates and our goal is to make your graduation from USF St. Petersburg a wonderful memory. Associate in Arts Certificate Requirements Upon the student's successful completion of the minimum requirements for the Associate in Arts Certificate, the Un i- versity will present the student who has properly made application with an appropria te certificate. 1. To receive the Associate in Arts (AA), the student must complete 60 semester hours of university credit; at least 20 of the last 30 semester hours or a total of 36 credit hours must be completed at USF St. Petersburg; the minimum grade point average must b e 2.0 based on work attempted within the USF System; in addition, a transfer student must have a GPA of 2.0 or higher when combined with transfer work accepted and evaluated by the USF St. P e- tersburg Office of Admissions; satisfy rule 6A -10.030 (Gordon Rul e) and the General Education Requirements of USF St. Petersburg must be satisfied. Physical Education and military science credits do not count within the 60 semester hours toward the Associate in Arts Certificate. In addition, the student must fulfill th e writing and computation course requirements of 6A -10.030 prior to receiving the Associate in Arts Certificate. 2. Application Procedure for the Associate in Arts Certificate. The Application for an Associate in Arts Certificate can be obtained on -line thro ugh the student's OASIS account. The deadline to apply for a degree/certificate in each s e- mester is stated in the Academic Calendar in the catalog. 3. The Associate in Arts certificate must be awarded prior to the term that the student becomes eligible for th e baccalaureate degree. 4. Final processing for the Associate in Arts Certificate will be done after grades are processed at the end of the s e- mester for which the student applied. All work, including transfer work taken in that semester will be evaluated with respect to the requirements for the Associate in Arts Certificate. 5. Any incomplete grades shown on the permanent record of an Associate in Arts applicant at the time grades are processed will be treated as an F in the calculation of grade point average. Baccalaureate Degree - University Requirements 91 6. The General Education Requirements will be based on the approved University policy in effect in the catalog year the student chooses according to the University policy regarding the choice of catalog. The consideration of whether or not General Education R equirements are met will be made without consideration of the student's choice of major at the time he/she applies. 7. Residence credit will be broadly defined to include USF sponsored student exchange programs and the University of Florida Correspondence Div ision. University of Florida Correspondence Division credit will not be included in the student's USF St. Petersburg grade point average. When the grades from USF sponsored student exchange program institutions are included in the grade point average calcu lation, they will also be counted in the student's grade point average as work attempted at USF for the Associate in Arts Certificate. 8. An applicant who has not been enrolled within the USF System for three semesters may be contacted to ascertain whether or not that applicant meets the residency requirements. 9. In approving any application for the Associate in Arts Certificate, satisfactory/unsatisfactory grades will be accepted according to the approved University policy in effect during the terms of the stud ent's enrollment without regard for the student's declared major. Students must be aware that if they have taken any courses on a satisfact o- ry/unsatisfactory basis where such grades are not acceptable by the college of the major, the students may be requir ed to repeat particular courses for a traditional letter grade or take additional courses for a traditional letter grade to meet the college requirements. 10. All USF St. Petersburg colleges will accept the AA Certificate from any USF institution. That is, the student will be placed at least at the junior level and will be considered to have met the University's General Education Requir e- ments. The applicability of the courses taken by the student toward his/her major program will be determined by the college of the student's major. Similarly, any special requirements for a student's professional certification (e.g., Education) are not necessarily met by the Associate in Arts certificate, but could be included as part of the General Education Requirements. Thus, students should check with their colleges concerning meeting any special requir e- ments in an efficient manner. 11. The awarding of the Associate in Arts Certificate is posted on the permanent record but does not alter the calculation of the grade -point average; nor does it interrupt the accumulation of the student's record. 12. Students who follow a baccalaureate degree program as recommended by a college will not necessarily be eligible for the Associate in Arts certificate prior to the completion of 90 semester ho urs.

The bases of education are a capacit y for and an appreciation of social change within a context of prior human achievement. The faculty of the Arts and Sciences strive to instill in their students a history of human ideas, a sense of love for learning, and an understanding of the means that scholars have used in their search for beauty and order in the natural world. The education provided by the disciplines of the Arts and Sciences is the foundation upon which the lives and professions of our students are built, and the basis from which pers onal growth occurs. The College of Arts and Sciences takes as its goal a melding of the natural, humanistic frameworks and social philosophies into a comprehensive whole that e n- courages the development of new ideas and new approaches to the understanding o f our universe. Great universities provide direction for their communities and service for their needs. The faculty of the Arts and Sciences as well as the staff, who support and encourage their work, explore their scholarly interests within the home and c ommunity created by the academic society. It is the responsibility of scholars to share their discoveries for the betterment of society. Thus, the Arts and Sciences embrace disciplines that strive to make immediate use of knowledge in the service of social goals as well as disciplines whose discoveries contribute to the fund of basic information that is the stepping stone of applied knowledge.

The College of Arts and Sciences offers major fields of study as described in the following pages. Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) Anthropology (ANT) on page 107 Criminology (CCJ) English (ENG) English and American Literature (LIT) Professional and Technical Writing (CWT) Political Science (POL) History (HTY) on page 128 Interdisciplinary Social Sciences (ISS) Mass Communications with Journalism and Media Studies Concentration (COM) Psychology (PSY) Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) Art Studio -Graphic Design Concentration Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Environmental Science and Policy (ESP) on page 119 Health Science (HSP) on page 124 Anthropology (ANT) 45.0101 Anthropology is the global, comparative study of human biological variation and cultural systems over all periods, from the prehistoric to the present. The undergraduate program allows students to explore this subject through the disc i- pline's four main are as of research: Biological Anthropology; Archaeology; Cultural Anthropology; and Linguistics. Our perspectives are worldwide, but we also study nearby communities, in trying to understand patterns of human physical differences, language, religion, marriage customs, conflict resolution or the evolution of societies themselves. Students with an undergraduate degree often go on to graduate programs in Anthropology but also find employment in a wide variety of settings including: archeological contract companie s; conducting research on urban community development; studying immigrant populations and how best to serve the health, social and educational needs of our increasingly diverse society. Students may also concentrate their studies in anthropology by choosin g this as one of the two cognate disciplines required for Interdisciplinary Studies (ISS) Majors. This allows students to take introductory and advanced anthropology courses and combine them with a second cognate discipline and a specific set of ISS course s. Students majoring in other fields may find anthropology coursework an exciting and valuable supplement to their primary academic interest. A minor in anthropology has been developed with this purpose in mind. The minor program is structured to allow the student maximum flexibility in course selection within a broadly defined progression of a n- thropological interests. Thus, the student is able to tailor a minor in anthropology to best suit a special focus in the context of an overall curriculum. Further in formation about the major, new courses, and the Anthropology faculty can be found on the web at http://www1.usfsp.edu/coas/scl/anthro.htm Prerequisites (State Mandated Common Prerequisites) for Students transferring from a Community College : Stu- dents wishi ng to transfer to USF should complete the A.A. degree at the community college. Students should complete two lower level, 2000 or 3000 level introductory courses in Anthropology prior to entering the university. If not taken at the community college, they must be completed before the degree is granted. Some courses required for the major may also meet General Education Requirements thereby transferring maximum hours to the university. A grade of \"C\" is the minimum acceptable grade. If students transfer with fewer than 60 semester hours of acceptable credit, the students must meet the university's entering freshman requirements including ACT or SAT test scores, GPA, and course r e- quirements. The transfer student should also be aware of the immunization, foreig n language, and continuous e n- rollment policies of the university. 108College of Arts and Sciences Anthropology Major Requirements Required Core Courses ANT 2410 Cultural Anthropology 3 ANT 2511 Biological Anthropology 3 ANT 2511L Biological Anthropology Lab 1 ANT 3101 Archaeology 3 ANT 3610 Anthropological Linguistics 3 ANT 4034 Theories of Culture 3 Required Method Courses, 3 hours from one of the following: ANT 4495 Methods in Cultural Research 3 ANT 4114 Seminar in Archaeological Method & Theory 3 ANT 4442 Urban Life & Culture 3 Required Capstone Course, 3 hours from one of the following: ANT 4302 Gender in Cross -Cultural Perspectives 3 ANT 4312 North American Indians 3 ANT 4935 Rethinking Anthropology 3 Beyond the required prerequisites listed above, the major in Anthropology consists of a minimum of 37 credit hours.

The program concentrates on achieving balance in the above aspects of the system from the perspective of the criminal justice professional, the offender, and society. The program provides a solid background in the theory, issues and methodology comprising Criminology. The objective of the undergraduate program in Criminology is to develop a sound educational basis either for graduate work or for professional training in one or more of the specialized areas comprising the modern urban criminal justice system. Recommended Prerequisites (State Mandated Common Prerequisites) Students wishing to transfer to USF should complete the A.A. degree at the community college. Some courses required for the major may also meet General Education Requirements thereby transferring maximum hours to the university. If students transfer with fewer than 60 semester hours of acceptable credit, the students must meet the university's entering freshman requirements including ACT or SAT test scores, GPA, and course requirements. There are no State Mandated Common Prerequisites for this degree program. Transfer students should be aware that by university regulation they are obligated to establish academic residency by completing the equivalent of one academic year (30 semester hours) in \"on -campus\" courses. All undergraduate transfer students electing Criminology as their major will be required, moreover, to take a minimum of 30 credit hours in major coursework at the U niversity of South Florida. The transfer student should also be aware of the immunization, foreign language, and continuous enrollment policies of the university. Criminology Major Requirements A minimum of 36 semester hours is required of all undergraduate majors in Criminology including: 1. Each of the following core courses: (21 hours) CCJ 3024 Survey of Criminal Justice* 3 CJE 3444 Crime CCJ 3117 Theories of Criminal Behavior* 3 CJE 3656 Introduction of Crime Analysis 3 CCJ 3701 Research Methods I 3 CCJ 3718 Applied Statistics in Crime 3 CCJ 4934 Senior Seminar 3 2. 15 semester hours of electives within the major. CCJ 3621 Patterns of Criminal Behavior CCJ 4930 Critical Issues in Policing CJC 4166 Alternatives to Incarceration CCJ 4450 Criminal Justice 4934 Senior 4940 Internship for Criminal Justice Majors CJC 4010 American Correctional Systems CJE 3641 Introduction to Forensic Science CJE 4010 Juvenile Justice System CJE 4114 American Law Enforcement Systems CJL 3052 Introduction to Courts CJL 3110 Substantive Criminal Law CJL 4410 Criminal Rights and Procedures NOTE: No more than six (6) hours of CCJ 4900 , CCJ 4910 or any combination of the two will be accepted toward the minimum number of hours in the major. A student may take an unlimited amount of CCJ 4933 or 4934 as long as they vary in topics. These residence requirements are designed to ensure that transfer students who subsequently receive their bacc a- laureate degree from the University of South Florida with a major in Criminology will have b een exposed to the same body of knowledge in their major as those students who complete all or a major portion of their coursework at the University of South Florida. Any student who receives a grade of \"D\" or lower in more than one USF CCJ course will be automatically barred from continuing as a Criminology major. College of Arts and Sciences 115 English (ENG) 23.0101 The program in English provides two areas of specialization/concentrations (divided into two degree -options below): Literature and Cultural Studies (LCSP) The undergraduate program in Literature and Cultural Studies prepares students to be excellent com municators and researchers, whether they move forward into careers or into graduate and professional schools. The program highlights three areas of study - American, British, and World Literatures - focusing on specific kinds of skills: reading deeply and analytically, writing critically and creatively, thinking conceptually and contextually, and using multiple research tools from the archives to the Internet. Literature and Cultural Studies considers how language works in a variety of historical, rhetorica l, and artistic contexts. Students who graduate from this program are both well situated and expected to be excellent, multifaceted users of language in the global communities they inhabit. Writing Studies (WSSP) The undergraduate program in Writing Studie s prepares students to work as innovative professional communicators in a variety of fields -- from government to business to medicine. The program brings together professional and public discourse within specific rhetorical situations so that writers exp erience specific local, global, organizational, and civic dimensions. We research, develop, evaluate, and practice professional and public discourse. Students are encouraged to collaborate with schools, corporations, agencies, and community -based organizat ions to design, develop, use, and evaluate oral, written, and digital artifacts. The program is designed to empower individual communicators in the ethical and strategic use of language in a variety of public and professional communities. The program will produce graduates who can effectively compose using a variety of tools in order to communicate with their audiences.

College of Arts and Sciences 119 Environmental Science and Policy (EVR) 03.0104 The status of the earth's environment has been a major concern since the 1960s. Currently, it represents one of the most critical issues facing nearly all nations individually as well as the earth community as a whole. Increased popul a- tion, technology, globalization and diminishing natural resources all play an important role in the changing environment. As a consequence, governments at all levels are devoting resources to help understand the problems that we are facing and to aid in their mitigation. This includes everything from public education to cleaning up toxic waste sites. This interdisciplinary and integrated major seeks to advance student s' critical abilities to solve real -world enviro n- mental problems, manage social -natural systems in a sustainable manner, and affect decisions involving environmental policy, resource management, and biodiversity conservation. The curriculum comprises an i ntensive foundation in the environmental sciences, physical -chemical sciences, social sciences, and the humanities, as well as the integration of these areas to study a problem in hand. Upon completion of the required course work, students will develop app reci- ation and a holistic view of how scientific truth (date and analysis based results) and policy (interpretation of data and analysis in the political context) work together to affect our everyday life (as an individual and as a society). This major will uniquely link science, policy and sustainability in the context of society and give greater meaning and context to environmental science and STEM education. The actions of people as an individual and society as a whole are crucial for environmental well -being and long -term sustainability. This degree emphasizes the understanding of interrelationships between social phenomena and the natural (i.e., biological -physical -chemical) environment. It is i ntended to (1) increase student awareness of these i n- terconnections in their everyday lives; (2) introduce students to a variety of social science perspectives (including politics and policies) along with hard environmental science perspectives, that help students make sense of these connections; (3) identify the contributions of each of these perspectives to our understanding of environmental pro b- lems; (4) discuss how natural resource management and environmental policy reflect these perspectives; and (5) produce graduates who promote sustainability in all facets of human enterprise The environmental industry is a growing arena for employment for degree holders at all levels. Students completing the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Environmental Science and P olicy have found employment with government agencies (city, county, state, and federal), private industry, and non -profit organizations. Examples of careers include field scientist, research scientist, policy analyst, lobbyist, conservationist, and educato r. Some also go on to attend graduate or law school. The B.S. in Environmental Science and Policy was approved in 1995. This interdisciplinary program is housed in the College of Arts and Sciences. All students must complete the University's General Educat ion Requirements. All majors in the program must complete the required core courses and select among the elective courses from the lists below. Please note that the core and elective courses differ between the Science, Policy, and Sustainability concentra tions. Finally, all majors must complete an upper division seminar and an internship or project. Unless stated otherwise, a grade of \"C -\" is the minimum acceptable grade. Students wishing to transfer to USFSP should complete the A.A. degree at the commun ity college. Some courses r e- quired for the major may also meet General Education Requirements thereby transferring maximum hours to the un i- versity. If students transfer with fewer than 60 semester hours of acceptable credit, the students must meet the university's entering freshman requirements including ACT or SAT test scores, GPA, and course requirements. The transfer student should also be aware of the immunization, foreign language, and continuous enrollment policies of the university. Transfer stude nts are encouraged to complete the following required supporting major courses prior to entering the university. Unless stated otherwise, a grade of \"C -\" is the minimum acceptable grade.

(19 credit hrs. for degree core, 9 for concentrations, 3 for capstone and 6 for degree electives). Concentration offers to specializations in: i) Environment and Society ii) Geospatial Sciences . The degree core focuses on physical geography and environmental systems including the hydrosphere, atmosphere, geosphere, and biosphere. Particular emphasis is placed on the human modification of the natural environment and the global interconnections of the major earth systems. Electives for the degree program focuses on human geography (where the social and spatial effects of the growth of cities, including issues such as the conflicts, economic restructuring, the growth and decline of inner -cities, and urban racial and ethnic relations and disease are discussed) and physical geography (where land -use changes and impacts of urbanization on water resources qualities and quantities are discussed). Geospatial Science concentration focuses on the quantitativ e and analytical study of relationships of events and pr o- cesses in space and time. In recent years, powerful new technologies and techniques have emerged that greatly improve our ability to acquire, archive, analyze and communicate information regarding pe ople, places and other processes on or near the Earth's surface. These same technologies and analytical frameworks allow us to combine this information into multi -tiered databases describing complex and inter -related aspects of our physical and social worl d. Students will learn these technologies and analytical framework. Environment and Society concentration provides students with an in-depth understanding of the socio -cultural and political contexts in which specific environmental problems arise and are addressed. Popular conceptual frameworks in human -environment interaction, such as political ecology, sustainable development, and natural hazards, are applied to a range of environmental problems at the local, national and global scales. Minimum Requiremen ts for Major Students must earn a C - or better in all major course work. D and F grades earned in major course work will be used in calculating the major GPA, except where removed by grade forgiveness. Students must maintain a minimum 2.0 major GPA in order to graduate .

The degree is founded in science, humanities and business, and designed specifically to provide students with a broad -based education in preparation for a wide spectrum of health services occupations or post -baccalaureate study. This is not a technical degree, nor is it designed specifically to prepare students for entrance into medical school. The degree will, however, prepare students for competitive graduate programs (e.g. Public Health, Public Administration, MBA, Communication Sciences and Disorders, and Law School) or as a direct entry into a health -related career (e.g. sales, hospital admi n- istration, health & safety, compliance, marketing, research support, management, communications, fundraising/ d e- velopment). All students must complete the University's General Education Requirements and residency requirement that 30 o f the last 60 hours be taken at USFSP. All majors in the program must complete the required core courses and select among the elective courses from the lists below. Finally, all majors must complete an internship or project. Unless stated otherwise, a gra de of \"C -\" is the minimum acceptable grade. The USF College of Public Health accepts all students in good academic standing as determined by USF St. Petersburg Office of the Registrar. No additional restrictions will be placed on USFSP students who meet admissions criteria to the Home institution. This degree is open to FTIC and transfer students. Students wishing to transfer to USF should co m- plete the A.A. degree at the community college. Some courses required for the major may also meet General Educati on Requirements thereby transferring maximum hours to the university. If students transfer with fewer than 60 semester hours of acceptable credit, the students must meet the university's entering freshman requirements including ACT or SAT test scores, GPA, and course requirements. The transfer student should also be aware of the immunization, foreign language, and continuous enrollment policies of the university. Transfer students are encouraged to complete the following required supporting major courses pr ior to entering the university. Unless stated otherwise, a grade of \"C -\" is the minimum acceptable grade. Undergraduates seeking this degree must complete core/required major courses and upper division courses in two of the four Concentration areas: 1) Hea lthcare Administration from the COB; and/or 2) Health Science and Humanities from CAS; (3) Public Health and/or 4) Communication Sciences and Disorders from COE; and a required senior capstone course.

Our faculty seeks to inform and question, to provoke and to challenge our students to a higher level of understanding of the past. History at South Florida offers the student an opportunity to explore civilizations from around the globe and from the ancient through contemporary eras. We encourage our students to move beyond traditional memorization of material to a critical level of thinking, analysis, and synthesis. Accomplis hed history majors are attractive to all kinds of employers in any number of fields, as well as to graduate and professional schools. USF history alumni can be found in such diverse professions as law, medicine, business, government, foreign service, polit ics, and education. History Major Requirements A minimum of 36 semester hours is required for a major in history. A minimum grade of \"C\" or better must be attained in each course counted toward the 36 -hour requirement. However, grades of \"D\" or \"F\" in history coursework will be used in calculating the major GPA unless the course is retaken under the grade forgiveness policy. Prerequisites (State Mandated Common Prerequisites) Students wishing to transfer to USF should complete the A.A. degree at the community college. If students transfer with fewer tha n 60 semester hours of acceptable credit, they must met the university's entering freshman requirements including ACT or SAT test scores, GPA, and course requirements. The transfer student should be aware of the immu n- ization, foreign language, and continuo us enrollment policies of the university. Students at a community college planning to transfer to USF and major in history are encouraged to complete as many of the lower level requirements as possible at the community college level. Courses that fulfill t he General Educ a- tion/Gordon Rule requirement would be especially valuable. The minimum acceptable grade for courses being tran s- ferred for history department credit is a \"C.\" If these courses have not been completed satisfactorily upon enrolling at USF, the y must be taken before the degree is granted. Lower -level Course Requirements for the Major A minimum of 12 hours of 2000 level courses, or their equivalent, constitute the lower level requirements. Two of these courses must be sequential. Students may cho ose from introductory courses in Western Civilization, Ancient, Medieval, Modern European, or American history to fulfill this two -course sequence. The remaining hourly requirements may be filled by taking any of the other 2000 level history courses. Upper -level Course Requirements for the Major A minimum of 24 hours of course work from the 3000 -4000 level is required to fulfill the 36 -hour minimum requirement. Two of these courses, the Pro -Seminar and the Theory of History courses are required for all majo rs. These courses should not be taken during the same semester. The remaining 16 hours of credit may be chosen from the department offerings each semester. It is recommended that history majors take writing, speech, and library/internet research skills courses. Additional hours can be profitably drawn from the following disciplines: Africana Studies, American Studies, Anthropology, Classics, Economics, Geography, Government and International Affairs, Psychology, Philosophy, Religious Studies, Sociology, Wom en's Studies, Literature, the Humanities, and the Fine Arts. Majors intending to pursue graduate work should take a minimum of two years of classical or modern foreign language. Open University courses and exit courses titled \"Issues in History\" ( 3308 ) are not eligible for major field credit. College of Arts and Sciences 129 Interdisciplinary Social Sciences (ISS) 45.0101 The ISS program is intended to provide students with a broad grounding in the social sciences while creating opport u- nities to explore selected disciplines in more depth. The program emphasizes critical analysis of social issues, introduces students to a variety of paradigms and perspectives with which to fram e social problems, gives students the opportunity to explore the research process, exposes students to a variety of methodologies, and emphasizes effective writing. The program provides a measure of flexibility and allows students to design a rigorous cour se of study built around at least two disciplinary interests (concentrations). Students plan their program in ongoing consultation with the advisor who approves each individual curriculum contract. Specific requirements for a B.A. degree in Interdisciplina ry Social Sciences (ISS) are outlined below: Students wishing to transfer to USF should complete the A.A. degree at the community college. Some courses required for the major may also meet General Education Requirements thereby transferring maximum hours t o the university. If students transfer with fewer than 60 semester hours of acceptable credit, the students must meet the university's entering freshman requirements including ACT or SAT test scores, GPA, and course requirements. Please be aware of the imm unization, foreign language, and continuous enrollment policies of the university. There are no State Mandated Common Prerequisites for the ISS degree program. Some of the following courses if available, during the program of study at the community college , and when feasible in General Education/Gordon Rule courses, could count toward the ISS degree. A grade of \"C\" is the minimum acceptable grade. *AFA 2000 Introduction to the Black Experience 3 [In Africa and Its Diaspora] 3 AMH 2010 American History I 3 or AMH 2020 American History II 3 ANT 2000 Introduction to Anthropology 3 ECO 2013 Economic Principles (Macroeconomics) 3 ECO 2023 Economic Principles (Microeconomics) 3 GEA 2000 World Regional Geography 3 POS 2041 American National Government 3 or POS 2112 State and Local Government 3 SYG 2000 Introduction to Sociology 3 WST 3015 Introduction to Women's Studies 3 * Course pending approval Interdisciplinary Social Sciences Core Courses Two of these courses, the introductory course ( ISS 3010) and the senior seminar ( ISS 4935 ), introduce and employ the interdisciplinary social science perspective. These courses involve students in the study of socially constructed realities; the various concepts, theories and methods used in the social sciences and their application to contemporary issues and questions. In addition to the two core ISS courses, students must take a research methods course from t he approved list. ISS majors are highly recommended to take one of the following courses early in their careers: ISS 1102 Self and Society 3 ISS 1103 Nature and Culture 3 Coursework required for Interdisciplinary Social Sciences Majors 1.

College of Arts and Sciences 135 Mass Communications (COM) 09.0102 The Department of Journalism and Media Studies, accredited by the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications, offers courses designed to help media practitioners and citizens of the 2st Century effectively create and consume mas s communications across a variety of media platforms. The Department recognizes Journalism as the core function of Mass Communications, but approaches studies and skill -building within a 21st Century context. The program introduces students to the theorie s, principles, and problems of mass communications, emphasizing the concept of freedom of information as the cornerstone of constitutional democracy and preparing students for future leadership roles in media and mass communications. Graduates should under stand the structure and functions of mass media systems as well as the basic processes of mass communications. Majors produce visual and text -based stories for public consumption. While pursuing their studies, students are strongly encouraged to take adva ntage of internship and employment opportunities with professional media outlets. Journalism and Media Studies Concentration Requirements (JMS) To be admitted as a major in the Journalism and Media Studies concentration, students must have completed general education requirements or a minimum of 45 hours with a 2.75 overall Grade Point Average (GPA), including ENC 1101 and ENC 1102 with a grade of \"C\" or higher (n o C-) in each. All three courses in the Journalism and Media Studies pre -core curriculum ( MMC 2100 , MMC 3602 , and VIC 3001 ) must also be completed with a minimum grade of \"C\" before taking additional Journalism and Media Studies courses. Students failing t o achieve a minimum grade of \"C\" in MMC 2100, MMC 3602* and VIC 3001 will not be allowed to become majors in this concentration. Departmental courses that qualify as general education requirements may be counted both as general education courses and as de partmental requirements. While completing the pre -core curriculum course MMC 2100, students take an exam that tests basic skills and knowledge in grammar, style and usage. Students interested in becoming majors in the Journalism and Media Studies concent ration must pass that exam with the score of at least 70%. Transfer students must also take an entrance exam that proves proficiency in grammar, style and usage at the 70% or better level. The exam is given external to classwork for transfer applicants to the major. In addition to the nine hours of pre -core curriculum courses (MMC 2100, MMC 3602* and VIC 3001), the major requires 35 hours of required and selected courses for a total of no more than 44 hours in Journalism and Media Studies within the 124-hour degree requirement. Six hours in Journalism and Media Studies writing courses are a part of the graduation requirement. A 2.5 GPA in Journalism and Media Studies coursework is required for graduation. A grade of \"D\" or \"F\" will not be counted toward a J ournalism and Media Studies major. Journalism and Media Studies majors taking more than 44 hours of Journalism and Media Studies courses, regardless of the departments in which those courses are listed, must take those hours in addition to the 124 hours r equired for graduation. In particular, film, writing, photography and other communication courses offered in other departments may be counted as part of the 44 maximum number of credits to be taken in Journalism and Media Studies courses. Please seek advis ing before determining which courses count as \"outside of the department\" electives and which do not. Journalism and Media Studies majors are required to take a minimum of 80 hours in courses outside the Journalism and Media Studies areas, with no fewer t han 65 hours in the College of Arts and Sciences. For a student to graduate with a major in Journalism and Media Studies, at least twenty -two (22) hours of resident department courses on the USFSP campus are required. All material submitted by students a s assignments in writing, reporting, editing, photography and digital news gathering and production classes is subject to publication or broadcast. The department uses a variety of print and electronic media outlets. Sign Language may be used as an option by Journalism and Media Studies majors to fulfill the language requirement. Most Journalism and Media Studies courses have prerequisites as specified in the course description (these prerequisites are separate from the state -mandated common prerequisites for program admission). Refer to each prerequisite listed to determine progressive prerequisites for each course. Students also should note that Journalism and Media Studies major is a four -semester program. As courses are offered in a sequenced way over s emesters and academic years, it may be impossible to complete the major in fewer than four academic semesters, not including summer. Prerequisites (State Mandated Common Prerequisites) This is a limited access program. Students wishing to transfer to USF SP may complete the A.A. degree at the community college. Some courses required for the major may also meet general education requirements thereby allowing the transfer of a maximum number of hours to the university. If students transfer with fewer than 60 semester hours of acceptable credit, the students must meet the university's entering freshman requirements including ACT or SAT test scores, GPA, and course requirements. Transfer students should also be aware of the immunization, foreign language, and c ontinuous enrollment policies of the university. Students are encouraged to complete the following prerequisites, or major, support, or elective courses if available, during the program of study at the community college, and when feasible in General Educat ion/Gordon Rule courses. 136College of Arts and Sciences ENC 1101 ENC 1102 English Composition (minimum grade of \"C\") 6 MMC 2100 Writing for Mass Media 3 MMC 3602 Mass Communication and Society 3 VIC 3001 Introduction to Visual Communications 3 A maximum of nine semester hours in Journalism and Media Studies courses will be accepted as transfer credits toward a degree in Journalism and Media Studies.

Students in the program examine basic questions of political science, including how nations struggle over power and wealth, how political communities reconcile claims of liberty, authority, and justice, and how governments and socie ties produce the laws and policies that influence our lives. Students choose courses from the major subfields of American politics, international relations and comparative politics, political theory and public law. Students develop critical analytical ski lls that allow them to understand and to explain political problems and issues at the local, state, national, and international levels. The USFSP program is unique in its focus on human rights and civil rights across the curriculum, as well as its commitm ent to civic engagement and experiential learning. A degree in political science will prepare students for positions in public service and the private sector, for law school, and for graduate work in political science, international relations, public admi nistration, and related di s- ciplines. Political Science Major Requirements The Political Science major consists of 39 credit hours. Students must take 12 hours of required core courses in p olitical science, three hours of a required core course in economics, and 24 hours of elective courses.

Minor in Geospatial Sciences (GSSP) 00.0000 Geospatial Science is the quantitative and analytical study of relationships of events and processes in space and time. In recent years, powerful new technologies and techniques have emerged that greatly improve our ability to acquire, archive, analyze and communicate information regarding people, places and other processes on or near the Earth's surface. These same technologies and analytical frameworks allow us t o combine this information into multi -tiered databases describing complex and inter -related aspects of our physical and social world. Such databases can then be analyzed in novel ways that take the spatial nature of disparate phenomena and processes into a ccount. The insights produced by these analyses are revolutionizing many fields of science including environmental science, oceanography, geology, criminology, and anthropology. These analyses also facilitate decision making, government operations i n- cludin g emergency response and disaster recovery planning. It also helps market analysis for businesses. Through now-commonplace consumer products such as web -based mapping systems and Global Positing Systems (GPS) units integrated with cellular phones are direc tly impacting the everyday lives of ordinary individuals. The mission of the minor in the Geospatial Sciences program is to offer students with a broad understanding of the fundamental theories and concepts underlying spatial analysis, hands -on experience with contemporary Geospatial Science hardware and software, and experience with the application of geospatial analysis to contemporary problems in environmental management, urban planning, business management, disease and health management, crime analysis and other fields.

We strive for quality education, meaningful research, ethical a wareness, intellectual and cultural diversity, and practical service to the community with a focus on sustainability and innovation in a stimulating environment. Requirements for Admission to the Kate Tiedemann College of Business Admission to the Kate Tiedemann College of Business is based upon availability of faculty and space within each disc i- pline. The College is an upper -level, limited access college, w hich means that it has admission requirements in addition to those of the University in general. Students interested in pursuing a degree in the areas offered by the College of Business must complete the required prerequisites for entering the college in a ddition to other related criteria listed in 1-4 below. 1. Before declaring a major in the College, students must satisfy the following criteria: a. Minimum of 60 semester hours of college credit earned. b. Minimum of 2.5 cumulative grade point average on all college -level work and a minimum of 2.0 on all credit attempted at USF, including any prior to renewal. c.

Students working toward meeting the limited access criteria will be permitted to enroll in all foundation courses in Business (listed below) except GEB 4890 , provided they have completed 60 semester hours and have met course prerequisites. 3. A minimu m score of 550 on paper and pencil or 213 on computerized TOEFL is required, when applicable. 4.

KATE TIEDEMANN COLLEGE OF BUSINESS 154Kate Tiedemann College of Business Transfer Students Transfer credits will be accepted from accredited institutions; however, all hours earned ma y not be applied toward USF St. Petersburg business degree requirements. Individual courses will be evaluated by an academic advisor and appr o- priately credited toward requirements in the student's program at USF St. Petersburg. Florida public junior/commun ity college students enrolled in an Associate in Arts (AA) program should normally co m- plete the general education requirements and the State Mandated Common Prerequisites at the junior/community college. As a rule, AA students should avoid taking any busin ess courses at the junior/community college that are listed as 3000 and 4000 level courses at USF St. Petersburg. Normally, courses in finance, marketing, management, and a c- counting, as well as other business and economics courses, taken at the lower divis ion level that are offered as upper division courses at USF St. Petersburg will not be accepted for upper division credit in business or economics. Exceptions to this policy will be made only upon proper validation of such courses. Validation consists of w ritten examinations prepared and administered by the College of Business or by successfully completing specified advanced courses in the discipline. Students who earned an AS from a Florida public institution are not automatically admissible to the Univers i- ties. Students who earned an AS in Firefighting or Dental Hygienist, for example, are not admitted without additional credentials. The AS (in Florida) in Business Administration is an articulated program so those students are admiss i- ble. If the AS in not in Business, the student needs to contact Admissions to find out if the University will admit them, and if they are admissible, they will be referred to Business Advising. Florida public junior/community college students pursuing an Associate of Scien ce (AS) program in any other discipline should contact the USF St. Petersburg Office of Admissions, BAY 128, (727) 873 -4142 for information regarding course transferability and degree articulation.

Many marketing concepts are applicable to the operations of non -profit organizations such as governmental, educational, and health car e institutions, as well as charitable and political campaigns. Marketing operations provide the most visible links between the firm or institution and its many publics. Marketing deals with people who are constantly changing in their needs, wants, and desi res; and coupled with these changing tastes is a fiercely competitive environment sustained by all the resources of a rapidly evolving technology. These forces lead to much of the challenge and to much of the dynamic nature of marketing.

The curriculum is designed to develop students' leadership potential and improve s tudents' planning, organizational, and managerial skills. USF St. Petersburg has partnership agreements with Clearwater Christian College, Eckerd College and St P e- tersburg College. Army ROTC training is divided into two phases: the first two years constitu te the Basic Course; the last two the Advanced Course. The Department offers both a four - and a two -year program, each leading to a commission as a Second Lie u- tenant in the United States Army. The four -year program requires completion of the Basic Course, a five -week field training course, and the Advanced Course. Students with prior active military service or previous training at military schools may be exempt from some or all of the Basic Course. Students with questions concerning the various options should contact the Professor of Military Science for more information. Enrollment is open to qualified students at all levels, including graduate students. Offerings are published each semester. Army ROTC training provides scholarships, pay, free uniforms and textbooks. Scholarships are awarded on a competitive basis in all academic majors. The scholarship pays full tuition or room and board, books, lab and mandatory fees, and certain other academic expenses. All Advanced Course and scholarship students receive a monthly subsistence payment that ranges from $300.00 as a freshman to $500.00 as a senior. This is in addition to the pay of approximately $700.00 while attending the five -week field training course at the Leadership Development and Assessment Course at Fort Lewis, Washington. Additional skills training: Airborne School, Air Assault School, and the Northern Warfare School are available to both Basic and Advanced Course students during semester breaks. Additional skills training and internships are also a vailable during the academic and summer session year to include first aid, rappelling, orienteering, color guards, etc. Basic Course: The Basic Course consists of four semesters of classroom instruction of one and a half hour each week and a leadership lab . Students incur no military commitment by participating in the Basic Course. In lieu of attending the basic course classroom instruction, a student may attend the four -week Leadership Training Course at Fort Knox, Kentucky during the summer of the student 's sophomore year. Advanced Course: The Advanced Course consists of four semesters of classroom instruction of three hours each week, leadership lab, physical fitness and field training exercises, and a five -week training phase at Leadership Development and Assessment Course . The Advanced Course is designed to prepare the student who desires to be a Professional Army Officer for duty, either Active Army, Reserve or National Guard. Additional follow -on training is available to selected cadets at both US bas ed and overseas active Army units. Job Opportunities: The newly commissioned officer can be guaranteed Reserve or National Guard duty, or compete for an Active Duty commission. Prior to commissioning the student may request to serve in a number of career fields to include aviation, engineering, medical, law, law enforcement, logistics, and personnel administration. Requirements for an ROTC Commission: Students who desire to earn a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army must meet the following requirements: four semesters of the ROTC Advanced Course, successful completion of the Professional Military Education Courses (written communication skills, computer literacy, water survival and military history), attendance at Leadership Development and Assessment Course , maintain and graduate with a mi n- imum of a 2.0 GPA, successful completion of the Army Physical Fitness Test, compliance with the Army height and weight standards, and other requirements o f the United States Army. Military Science and Leadership Faculty at USF St. Petersburg Assistant Professors of Military Science: Eric Schulze; SFC Ronald Gordon; S FC Miguel Ramirez MILITARY SCIENCE AND LEADERSHIP - ARMY RESERVE OFFICERS TRAINING CORPS (ROTC) Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System 183 Courses in this catalog are identified by prefixes and numbers that were assigne d by Florida's Statewide Course Nu m- bering System (SCNS). This numbering system is used by all public postsecondary institutions in Florida and 28 parti c- ipating non -public institutions. The major purpose of this system is to facilitate the transfer of cours es between pa r- ticipating institutions. Students and administrators can use the online Statewide Course Numbering System to obtain course descriptions and specific information about course transfer between participating Florida institutions. This informatio n is at the SCNS website at http://scns.fldoe.org . Each participating institution controls the title, credit, and content of its own courses and recommends the first digit of the course number to indicate the level at which students normally take the course. Course prefixes and the last three digits of the course numbers are assigned by members of faculty discipline committees appointed for that purpose by the Florida Department of Education in Tallahassee. Individuals nominated to serve on these committees are selected to maintain a representative balance as to type of institution and discipline field or specialization. The course prefix and each digit in the course number have a meaning in the Statewide Co urse Numbering System (SCNS). The list of course prefixes and numbers, along with their generic titles, is referred to as the \"SCNS taxonomy.\" Descriptions of the content of courses are referred to as \"statewide course profiles.\" Example of Course Identifier Prefix Level Code (first digit) Century Digit (second digit) Decade Digit (third digit) Unit Digit (fourth digit) Lab Code ENC 1 1 0 1 English Composition Lower (Freshman) Level at this institution Freshman Composition Freshman Composition Skills Freshman Composition Skills I No laboratory component in this course General Rule for Course Equivalencies Equivalent courses at different institutions are identified by the same prefixes and same last three digits of the course number and are guaranteed to be transferable between participating institutions that offer the course, with a few exceptions. (Excepti ons are listed below.) For example, a freshman composition skills course is offered by 56 different postsecondary institutions. Each institution uses \"ENC_101\" to identify its freshman composition skills course. The level code is the first digit and repres ents the year in which students normally take the course at a specific institution. In the SCNS taxonomy, \"ENC\" means \"English Composition,\" the digit \"0\" represents \"Freshman Skil ls,\" and the unit digit \"1\" represents \"Freshman Composition Skills I.\" In the sciences and certain other areas, a \"C\" or \"L\" after the course number is known as a lab indicator. The \"C\" re p- resents a combined lecture and laboratory course that meets in the same place at the same time. The \"L\" represents a laboratory course or the laboratory part of a course, having the same prefix and course number without a lab indicator, which meets at a different time or place. Transfer of any successfully completed cour se from one participating institution to another is guaranteed in cases where the course to be transferred is equivalent to one offered by the receiving institution. Equivalencies are established by the same prefix and last three digits and comparable facu lty credentials at both institutions. For example, ENC 1101 is offered at a community college. The same course is offered at a state university as ENC 2101. A student who has su c- cessfully completed ENC 1101 at the community college is guaranteed to receive transfer credit for ENC 2101 at the state university if the student transfers. The student cannot be required to take ENC 2101 again since ENC 1101 is equivalent to ENC 2101. Transfer credit must be awarded for successfully completed equivalent courses an d used by the receiving institution to determine satisfaction of requirements by transfer students on the same basis as credit awarded to the native students. It is the prerogative of the receiving institution, however, to offer transfer credit for courses successfully completed that have not been designated as equivalent. NOTE : Credit generated at institutions on the quarter -term system may not transfer the equivalent number of credits to institutions on semester -term systems. For example, 4.0 quarter hour s often transfers as 2.67 semester hours. The Course Prefix The course prefix is a three -letter designator for a major division of an academic discipline, subject matter area, or sub-category of knowledge. Th e prefix is not intended to identify the department in which a course is offered. Rather, the content of a course determines the assigned prefix to identify the course. FLORIDA 'S STATEWIDE COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM 184Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System Authority for Acceptance of Equivalent Courses Section 1007.24(7), Florida Statutes, states: Any student who transfers among postsecondary institutions that are fully accredited by a regional or national a c- crediting agency recognized by the United States D epartment of Education and that participate in the statewide course numbering system shall be awarded credit by the receiving institution for courses satisfactorily completed by the student at the previous institutions. Credit shall be awarded if the cours es are judged by the appropriate statewide course numbering system faculty committees representing school districts, public postsecondary educational instit u- tions, and participating nonpublic postsecondary educational institutions to be academically equiva lent to courses offered at the receiving institution, including equivalency of faculty credentials, regardless of the public or nonpublic control of the previous institution. The Department of Education shall ensure that credits to be accepted by a receivi ng institution are generated in courses for which the faculty possess credentials that are comparable to those required by the accrediting association of the receiving institution. The award of credit may be limited to courses that are entered in the state wide course numbering system. Credits awarded pursuant to this subsection shall satisfy institutional r e- quirements on the same basis as credits awarded to native students. Excepti ons to the General Rule for Equivalency Since the initial implementation of the SCNS, specific disciplines or types of courses have been excepted from the guarantee of transfer for equivalent courses. These include varying topics courses that must be evalu ated individually, or applied courses in which the student must be evaluated for mastery of skill and technique. The following courses are exceptions to the general rule for course equivalencies and may not transfer. Transferability is at the discretion of the receiving institution. A. Courses not offered by the receiving institution. B. For courses at non -regionally accredited institutions, courses offered prior to the established transfer date of the course in question. C. Courses in the _90 0-999 series are not automatically transferable, and must be evaluated individually. These include such courses as Special Topics, Internships, Apprenticeships, Practica, Study Abroad, Thesis and Dissertations. D. College preparatory and vocational preparator y courses. E. Graduate courses. F. Internships, apprenticeships, practica, clinical experiences and study abroad courses with numbers other than those ranging from 900 -999. G. Applied courses in the performing arts (Art, Dance, Interior Design, Music, and Theatre) and skills courses in Criminal Justice (academy certificate courses) are not guaranteed as transferable. These courses need evidence of achievement (i.e., portfolio, audition, interview, etc.). Courses at Nonregionally Accredited Institutions The Statewide Course Numbering System makes available on its home page ( http://scns.fldoe.org ) a report entitled \"Courses at Nonregionally Accredited In stitutions\" that contains a comprehensive listing of all nonpublic institution courses in the SCNS inventory, as well as each course's transfer level and transfer effective date. This report is updated monthly.
