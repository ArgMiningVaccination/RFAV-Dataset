Since the first reports in the 1940s of fish vaccination for disease prevention [ [2](#B2-microorganisms-07-00569)], there have been many vaccines developed that significantly reduced the impact of bacterial and some viral diseases in fish [ [3](#B3-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Millions of fish are vaccinated annually, and in some areas of the world there has been a transition away from antibiotics and toward vaccination. For example, there has been a dramatic reduction in the use of antibiotics in Norwegian salmon farming since the introduction of vaccines [ [4](#B4-microorganisms-07-00569)], and vaccination has become the most cost-effective and sustainable method of controlling infectious fish diseases [ [5](#B5-microorganisms-07-00569)]. [6](#B6-microorganisms-07-00569), [7](#B7-microorganisms-07-00569)]. A historical review on fish vaccine research and the early pioneers in this field was published by Gudding and his colleagues [ [8](#B8-microorganisms-07-00569)]. The use of adjuvants and immunostimulants in fish vaccines, along with delivery methods, has been summarized by many researchers. Such work has focused on alternative methods (other than injection) for vaccine delivery, and the protective efficacies of traditional and promising new generation adjuvants [ [9](#B9-microorganisms-07-00569), [10](#B10-microorganisms-07-00569), [11](#B11-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Sommerset et al. described commercially available fish vaccines and how they perceived that the field would evolve over time [ [12](#B12-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Additional reviews have focused on current vaccine applications for large-scale fish farming operations, and future trends for inactivated, live-attenuated, and DNA vaccines [ [13](#B13-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Given the development of new technology and a lack of research reviews on advancements in fish vaccine technologies, there is a need for a comprehensive overview of where the field is currently. Up to now, over 26 licensed fish vaccines are commercially available worldwide for use in a variety of fish species ( [Table 1](#microorganisms-07-00569-t001)). Most of the vaccines have been approved for use by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for a variety of aquaculture species, and the majority of these vaccines utilize conventional production methods that start by culturing target pathogens [ [14](#B14-microorganisms-07-00569), [15](#B15-microorganisms-07-00569)]. This array of vaccines has successfully protected fish against a variety of serious fish diseases. [16](#B16-microorganisms-07-00569), [17](#B17-microorganisms-07-00569), [18](#B18-microorganisms-07-00569), [19](#B19-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Modern vaccine technology has targeted specific pathogen components, and vaccines developed using such approaches may include subunit or recombinant DNA vaccines that contain novel antigens produced using various expression systems [ [19](#B19-microorganisms-07-00569), [20](#B20-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Other technologies, such as RNA particle vaccines, have been developed globally and appear to induce greater levels of immunity than traditional vaccine technology [ [18](#B18-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Overall, such advances are promising; however, actual implementation had been somewhat limited for aquaculture due in part to the challenges of the aqueous environment and practical application of mass vaccination due to the nature of commercial fish farming [ [21](#B21-microorganisms-07-00569)]. In this review, we describe the use of conventional aquaculture vaccines and provide an overview of molecular approaches to vaccine development that are the most promising for new vaccines for use in aquaculture. 2. Conventional Fish Vaccines [26](#B26-microorganisms-07-00569)]. The majority of licensed vaccines presently used in aquaculture are produced using conventional methods and principles similar to those initially developed by Jenner and Pasteur centuries ago [ [27](#B27-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Early fish vaccines consisted of formalin-killed bacteria, with or without adjuvant [ [10](#B10-microorganisms-07-00569), [11](#B11-microorganisms-07-00569)]. These were delivered through immersion or injection routes and in turn induced some level of humoral immunity ( [Figure 1](#microorganisms-07-00569-f001)). In the 1990s, some modified live vaccines were developed and commercialized for use in aquaculture [ [28](#B28-microorganisms-07-00569)]. These vaccines have been successful and their implementation has resulted in increased production for commercial aquaculture along with reduced use of chemical therapeutics and feed delivered antibiotics [ [3](#B3-microorganisms-07-00569), [8](#B8-microorganisms-07-00569)]. 2.1. Inactivated/Killed Vaccine [29](#B29-microorganisms-07-00569)]. In contrast to live vaccines (discussed below) inactivated vaccines are more stable under field conditions and may be less expensive to produce [ [30](#B30-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Inactivated vaccines do not persist within the environment or in the vaccinated fish, so they are usually found to be safe, but may induce weaker or shorter-lived immunity when compared other vaccine types [ [31](#B31-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Weak immunogenicity of inactivated vaccines may be attributed to a poor activation of cellular immunity within the fish species and, therefore, can necessitate the use of adjuvants or multiple booster immunizations to induce protective immunity. Once administered, phagocytic antigen presenting cells (APCs) begin the process of removing activated immune cells and eliciting a humoral immune response with memory. Disadvantages for inactivated vaccines include the potential for immunosuppressive passenger antigens, toxic reactions caused by immune-enhancing adjuvants, reduced immunogenicity due to denaturation of proteins, and systemic reactions to certain adjuvants [ [32](#B32-microorganisms-07-00569)]. [3](#B3-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Following the success of this immersion vaccines for vibriosis (caused by Vibrio spp.) of trout and salmon were developed. The same principle for the inactivation of bacterial pathogens of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) was used to develop the early salmonid vaccines that were delivered by immersion [ [28](#B28-microorganisms-07-00569)]. These early immersion vaccines against A. salmonicida were not effective, as Bricknell et al. reported on the first injection-based bacterial vaccine in Atlantic salmon [ [33](#B33-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Currently, large-scale commercial aquaculture operations, especially those focused on high-value species such as Atlantic salmon, primarily utilize killed polyvalent injectable vaccines that contain adjuvant and multiple antigens to protect against different diseases [ [12](#B12-microorganisms-07-00569), [34](#B34-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Four of the eight licensed vaccines for fish in the US are killed vaccines ( [Table 1](#microorganisms-07-00569-t001)). These include: an A. for use in salmonids, an infectious salmon anemia (ISA) virus vaccine, and a Y. ruckeri bacterin for use in salmonids. Killed vaccines against and yellowtail Japan and Europe also exist [ [12](#B12-microorganisms-07-00569)]. There is also a killed vibriosis vaccine, combined with Photobacterium damselae (subsp. piscicida), available and used in European sea bass and sea bream culture ( [Table 1](#microorganisms-07-00569-t001)). So far, there is only one bacterin (ERM vaccine) commercially available as an oral vaccine. Autogenous vaccines are created from site-specific, isolated pathogens of interest and provide more flexibility in production regulation, and are implemented within a collaborative veterinary-client-patient-relationship [ [35](#B35-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Inactivated autogenous homologous vaccines, which are often killed bacterial strains, may provide producers with a cost-effective alternative to commercial vaccines, and these vaccines can be catered to specific pathogens that are problematic to a particular operation [ [6](#B6-microorganisms-07-00569), [14](#B14-microorganisms-07-00569)]. These vaccines may offer a responsive solution to emerging pathogens of interest, where commercial vaccines may not be applicable [ [35](#B35-microorganisms-07-00569)]. [36](#B36-microorganisms-07-00569)]. A formalin-inactivated Edwardsiella ictaluri vaccine previously used in aquaculture was shown to have a limited ability to enter the fish [ [37](#B37-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Some studies have shown that inactivated vaccines do not generate sufficient immunity for salmon pancreas disease virus (SPDV) or red sea bream iridovirus disease [ [38](#B38-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Additionally, it is difficult to obtain long-lasting immunity against salmon rickettsial syndrome (Piscirickettsia salmonis infection). Booster immunizations can enhance immunity and even oral boosters have been shown to strengthen the immune response to a specific pathogen; for example, this was demonstrated for Francisellosis (Franscisella spp), which is caused by infection with F. noatunensis [ [39](#B39-microorganisms-07-00569)]. 2.2. Live Vaccines [40](#B40-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Live vaccines tend to be more immunogenic than killed preparations due to their ability to proliferate or enter the host and stimulate greater cellular responses linked to both innate and adaptive immunity [ [41](#B41-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Such cell-mediated immune responses are considered to mimic a natural pathogen infection almost identically and, in turn, generate a strong antibody response. Since the pathogen enters and often replicates within the host, the animal can develop adequate cellular memory resulting in long-lasting immunity, which is clearly a major benefit in agricultural and aquaculture species [ [28](#B28-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Since live vaccines are usually quite effective and retain attributes of natural infection, the use of an accompanying adjuvant is not typically required to enhance efficacy. In terms of commercial applications for aquaculture, live vaccines have a greater potential to be administered via oral or immersion routes ( [Figure 1](#microorganisms-07-00569-f001)). Thus, the mode of administration is more dynamic than for inactivated vaccines that must utilize adjuvants [ [29](#B29-microorganisms-07-00569)]. [42](#B42-microorganisms-07-00569)]. The live Arthrobacter vaccine, named Renogen against BKD, has been licensed in Canada and Chile [ [28](#B28-microorganisms-07-00569)] and consists of non-pathogenic soil bacteria that provide cross-protection to the virulent Renibacterium salmoninarum. A live viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) vaccine is available in Germany [ [43](#B43-microorganisms-07-00569)], and a live viral vaccine against Koi herpesvirus (KHV) for carp is available for use in Israel [ [44](#B44-microorganisms-07-00569)]. [25](#B25-microorganisms-07-00569), [45](#B45-microorganisms-07-00569), [46](#B46-microorganisms-07-00569), [47](#B47-microorganisms-07-00569)]. This strategy is one of the most successful chemical mutagenesis strategies for Gram-negative bacteria. Norqvist et al. utilized this approach for attenuation of V. anguillarum for use with rainbow trout [ [48](#B48-microorganisms-07-00569)]. This approach has also been used to attenuate Flavobacterium psychrophilum, and has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in salmonids [ [49](#B49-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Over the past decade, this F. psychrophilum vaccine has been further investigated and enhanced following production under iron limited conditions (designated B.17:ILM), has been optimized under a range of conditions, and has been shown to provide robust cross-protection against a wide variety of global F. was also implemented for other fish pathogens that include A. hydrophila [ [56](#B56-microorganisms-07-00569)] and niloticus) or carp species [ [60](#B60-microorganisms-07-00569)], E. tarda in channel catfish and Japanese flounder [ [61](#B61-microorganisms-07-00569), [62](#B62-microorganisms-07-00569)], and V. anguillarum in Japanese flounder [ [63](#B63-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Other chemical agents, like acriflavine dye and novobiocin, were used to attenuate Streptococcus and A. hydrophila [ [64](#B64-microorganisms-07-00569), [65](#B65-microorganisms-07-00569)], but, to date, these vaccines have not been commercialized. [24](#B24-microorganisms-07-00569), [66](#B66-microorganisms-07-00569)]. This use of this antigenic cross-reactivity microbe as an antigen can be effective, and other strategies to attenuate fish pathogens have been explored. These include serial passages [ [67](#B67-microorganisms-07-00569)] and the use of phylogenetic relatedness and antigenic cross-reactivity microbes as an antigen [ [24](#B24-microorganisms-07-00569), [66](#B66-microorganisms-07-00569), [68](#B68-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Physical processes were also used to induce mutations. For example, Perelberg et al. mutated an attenuated KHV by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, which likely modified several additional viral genes, in an attempt to enhance attenuation and reduce the possibility of reversion back to a pathogenic phenotype [ [69](#B69-microorganisms-07-00569)]. [70](#B70-microorganisms-07-00569)]. By selecting (TK), or dUTPase genes, it was found that similar levels of specific serum antibodies to the parental wild-type virus were induced, and it was suggested that these may serve as suitable live vaccines where virulence factor production, such as polysaccharides, M-like proteins, and phosphoglucomutase, was eliminated [ [79](#B79-microorganisms-07-00569), [80](#B80-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Other examples where genetic manipulation has resulted in attenuation include mutant Francisella asiatica [ [81](#B81-microorganisms-07-00569)], and V. alginolyticus strains [ [83](#B83-microorganisms-07-00569)]. These have provided protection in fish and suggested further development for live vaccine technologies for aquaculture. 3. Alternative Vaccine Technology 3.1. Subunit Vaccines [84](#B84-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Subunit vaccines can be produced in a highly characterized state, and they target immune responses toward specific microbial determinants, enable the incorporation of unnatural components, and can be freeze-dried, allowing for non-refrigerated transport and storage [ [84](#B84-microorganisms-07-00569), [85](#B85-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Subunit vaccines have many desirable qualities, but in many cases, their ability to stimulate a potent immune response can be weaker than killed or live whole cell preparations. This is due to the limited number of components that are represented and capable of stimulating an immune system and the lack of replication or exposure to multiple antigens representing a whole cell vaccine. Some subunit vaccines rely on effective adjuvants to elicit the appropriate immunity, since the simplified (synthetic, recombinant, and/or highly purified) antigenic components of the vaccine mostly lack immunogenicity by themselves, and may require multiple booster immunizations to ensure long- term protective ni) [ [92](#B92-microorganisms-07-00569)], and salmonid alphavirus 3 recombinant proteins produced in a fish cell line [ [93](#B93-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Although substantial research has been conducted on subunit vaccines, they have not been widely developed or commercialized for use in aquaculture. This is likely due to the need for adjuvants to stimulate adequate protection against some pathogens of concern [ [9](#B9-microorganisms-07-00569), [85](#B85-microorganisms-07-00569), [94](#B94-microorganisms-07-00569), [95](#B95-microorganisms-07-00569), [96](#B96-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Further, with respect to production costs, recombinant vaccines may often be expensive to produce for fish species, animals that may be considered low-value in comparison to other agricultural production species [ [97](#B97-microorganisms-07-00569)]. This is due to additional protein processing methods that are required to ensure vaccine efficacy [ [97](#B97-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Despite these limitations, this strategy may still be important and has the potential to succeed for pathogens that are difficult to cultivate, such as the piscine myocarditis virus (causing cardiomyopathy syndrome in Atlantic salmon). [Figure 1](#microorganisms-07-00569-f001)), which are formed from the self-assembly of viral capsid proteins into particles that mimic the natural structure of the virus [ [98](#B98-microorganisms-07-00569)]. However, unlike the actual viral particles, VLPs lack genomic material, precluding any possibility of reversion mutations or pathogenic infection [ [99](#B99-microorganisms-07-00569)]. VLPs are unable to replicate in the recipient, but can potentiate both innate and adaptive immune responses through the recognition of repetitive subunits and by producing high cellular and humoral responses [ [100](#B100-microorganisms-07-00569)]. VLPs, both non-enveloped and enveloped, have been produced in bacteria, yeast, transgenic plants, insect, mammalian, and cell-free platforms. Additionally, vaccine antigens can be produced as genetic fusions or chemical conjugates to viral structural proteins, resulting in chimeric VLPs [ [101](#B101-microorganisms-07-00569)]. [102](#B102-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Recently, various VLP vaccine candidates for fish diseases have been developed. For example, nervous necrosis virus (NNV) VLP vaccines that utilized E. coli, yeast, baculovirus, and plant or cell-free self-assembled expression were produced. Those studies showed that VLPs with similar size and geometry to the native virus could elicit an antibody response in fish by injection [ [103](#B103-microorganisms-07-00569), [104](#B104-microorganisms-07-00569), [105](#B105-microorganisms-07-00569), [106](#B106-microorganisms-07-00569), [107](#B107-microorganisms-07-00569), [108](#B108-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Chien et al. and et al. developed oral VLP vaccines against grouper NNV [ [109](#B109-microorganisms-07-00569), [110](#B110-microorganisms-07-00569)]. demonstrated capsid VP2, expressed in yeast, self-assembles into subviral particles (SVPs) and the injection of the SVPs into rainbow trout elicits an immune response [ [111](#B111-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Guo et al. reported that two IHNV recombinant viruses displaying IPNV VP2 protein were generated using the RNA polymerase system against both IHNV and IPNV infection [ [112](#B112-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Based on these and other studies, VLPs have been shown to elicit strong immunogenicity and constitute a safe alternative to inactivated or attenuated vaccines. 3.2. Nucleic Acid Vaccines [113](#B113-microorganisms-07-00569)]. It has been suggested that these vaccines have the combined positive attributes of both live attenuated and subunit vaccines [ [113](#B113-microorganisms-07-00569), [114](#B114-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Nucleic acid vaccines consist of DNA or RNA encoding the antigen(s) of interest and are considered relatively simple to generate and safe to administer since they cannot revert to a pathogenic state [ [26](#B26-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Nucleotide-based vaccines have advantages over other vaccines that include production flexibility that is scalable and cost competitive, and the need for cold storage is eliminated. Newer RNA-based vaccines offer all the advantages of nucleotide-based approaches, including enhanced immunogenicity, and it has been suggested that this advanced technology may start a revolution in medicine. 3.2.1. DNA Vaccines [114](#B114-microorganisms-07-00569)]. DNA vaccines are able to strongly activate cellular and humoral immunity. The development of DNA vaccines can be rapid and relatively straightforward if a protective antigen is known. DNA vaccines are often more effective in protecting against viral infections, and have been especially efficient against fish rhabdoviruses, as they usually utilize the same cellular mechanics that a virus utilizes once they enter a host cell [ [115](#B115-microorganisms-07-00569)]. DNA vaccines also have been efficacious in the prevention of fish exposure to intracellular bacteria, like Mycobacterium marinum [ [116](#B116-microorganisms-07-00569), [117](#B117-microorganisms-07-00569)]. [114](#B114-microorganisms-07-00569)]. In the past decade, other experimental DNA vaccines have been developed against a variety of aquatic pathogens and for a wide array of fish species [ [118](#B118-microorganisms-07-00569)]. However, only a limited number of these have been commercialized and made available for the market. One is a DNA vaccine against IHNV, which was licensed and commercialized in Canada (Apex-IHN), and another is against pancreas disease virus in the European Union (salmonid alphavirus subtype 3 DNA vaccine) [Table 1](#microorganisms-07-00569-t001)). [114](#B114-microorganisms-07-00569), [115](#B115-microorganisms-07-00569), [119](#B119-microorganisms-07-00569)]. The route of administration for these vaccines is intramuscular (IM) injection in most fish species, as the genetic material must be relatively protected in order to gain entry into host cells [ [120](#B120-microorganisms-07-00569)]. After being injected with a DNA vaccine, fish demonstrate enhanced innate and adaptive immunity similar to mammalian species [ [115](#B115-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Additionally, DNA vaccines can usually be constructed to be multivalent, and provide protection or cross-protection by using gene coding for multiple antigens in the plasmid design [ [121](#B121-microorganisms-07-00569)]. DNA vaccines are considered safer than attenuated live vaccines as they only express the antigenic protein segments and not the entire organism, although the antigen interactions within the host are not well understood. As the antigen is produced inside of the organism via genetic expression from host cells, the duration of the immune response is in most cases long-lasting [ [122](#B122-microorganisms-07-00569)]. 3.2.2. RNA-Based Vaccines [110](#B110-microorganisms-07-00569)]. The RNA-based vaccines are developing rapidly and several have demonstrated encouraging results in both human and animals [ [123](#B123-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Using RNA in a vaccine has a number of advantages: it is safe because RNA is non-infectious and degraded by normal cellular processes, and there is no potential risk of infection or insertional mutagenesis. Furthermore, RNA is a potent stimulator of immunity [ [123](#B123-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Recent advances in RNA vaccine technology have been extensively reviewed in several publications [ [26](#B26-microorganisms-07-00569), [123](#B123-microorganisms-07-00569), [124](#B124-microorganisms-07-00569), [125](#B125-microorganisms-07-00569), [126](#B126-microorganisms-07-00569)], and thus, the successes and impact are briefly summarized in the context of their future promise for application in aquaculture. [127](#B127-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Alphaviruses belong to the family Togaviridae, which includes the Sindbis virus, Semliki Forest virus, and equine encephalitis viruses [ [128](#B128-microorganisms-07-00569), [129](#B129-microorganisms-07-00569)]. The alphavirus vector vaccine has a single RNA gene encoding RNA replication machinery, which is left intact, but the genes encoding the structural proteins are replaced with the antigen of interest. This antigen-encoding RNA replicon platform enables a large number of antigens from an extremely small dose of vaccine to be produced in vitro transcribed (IVT) from a DNA template [ [123](#B123-microorganisms-07-00569)]. The viral replication takes place in the cytoplasm of the host cell and, therefore, is independent of the host replication system, making replicase-based nucleic acid vaccines a very efficient and attractive delivery vehicle [ [124](#B124-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Previous research has demonstrated that alphaviral RNA vaccines are more efficient at stimulating antigen specific immune responses, particularly cellular responses, as compared with conventional plasmid DNA vaccines [ [130](#B130-microorganisms-07-00569)]. [131](#B131-microorganisms-07-00569)]. The RPs RNA vaccine that was approved by the United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) against influenza A virus in swine was produced using a unique SirraVaxSM RNA particle technology platform (Harris Vaccine Inc., now Merck Animal Health) [ [131](#B131-microorganisms-07-00569), [132](#B132-microorganisms-07-00569)]. In 2014, just four months after the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) broke out in the United States and affected about 50% of the swine population, Harris vaccines commercialized an RP vaccine that prevented this disease [ [133](#B133-microorganisms-07-00569)] The alphavirus RPs RNA vaccine has been developed and has been shown to provide protection against many pathogens in many different species [ [131](#B131-microorganisms-07-00569), [134](#B134-microorganisms-07-00569), [135](#B135-microorganisms-07-00569), [136](#B136-microorganisms-07-00569)]. These vaccines can induce robust and balanced immune responses and offer many other advantages associated with ideal vaccines. The alphavirus replicase functions in a broad range of host cells, like mammalian, avian, reptilian, amphibian, insect, and fish. Therefore, by replacing the genes for the structural proteins of the virus with a fish pathogen antigen of interest, the self-amplifying RNA vaccine could potentially protect against a number of important fish diseases. SPDV, a known salmonid alphavirus (SAV), was assigned to the family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus, and resembles the genome of mammalian alphaviruses. Kalsen et al. described the characterization of untranslated regions of the salmonid alphavirus 3 (SAV3) genome an SAV3 based replicon [ [137](#B137-microorganisms-07-00569)]. This replicon vaccine provides high protection against ISA by IM injection without adjuvant, but intraperitoneal (IP) administration of the same replicon vaccine did not induce protection [ [138](#B138-microorganisms-07-00569), [139](#B139-microorganisms-07-00569)]. Hence, the SAV-based replicon represents a vaccine candidate for aquaculture. 4. Conclusion Author Contributions Funding Conflicts of Interest References - Sneeringer, S.; Bowman, M.; Clancy, M.
