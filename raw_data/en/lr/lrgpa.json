There are so many beneficial crystals to choose from that can complement your yoga lifestyle. You might resonate with certain stones or be attracted to them based on your personal needs. You might be attracted to wearing [emerald](http://amzn.to/1SUYQ56) in the spring because of its connection to our [Third Chakra](http://youaligned.com/om/the-third-chakra-how-it-impacts-your-personal-power/) (the center of transformation and change). [Rose quartz](http://amzn.to/1s3pPSB) can encourage love, while [amethyst](http://amzn.to/1SUZ5xd) can take away anxiety. The fact is that the crystals pick you depending on your needs in a given moment. Healing crystals are also referred to as gemstones or chakra stones. Whatever healing gemstone you may turn to, it's important to know that every stone should be cleansed regularly. When Should You Cleanse Your Stones? Begin right after you buy or receive it. Then after that, if you wear a stone for healing purposes, it needs cleansing and \"recharging\" after each use. If worn as jewelry, you can opt to cleanse them daily or weekly, especially after they start looking dull. Crystals that are used to cleanse our environment (such as [selenite](http://amzn.to/1SUZiAr) in your home) should be cleansed monthly. Healing crystals, or gemstones, are part of a category called \"vibrational healing.\" They both absorb and give energy, so it's important to discard any built-up negativity. You can cleanse your stones based on their type and color. For example, for softer stones such as [malachite](http://amzn.to/1SUZy2u) or selenite, you can use sunlight or moonlight rather than water (so the water doesn't \"wash away\" any properties). Whichever method you choose, gemstone cleaning doesn't need to be a hassle. How to Cleanse Your Crystals - Here Are 7 of the Most Effective, Convenient Ways to Cleanse and Recharge Your Healing Crystals: 1. Natural Water Water neutralizes the negative energy stored in the stone and directs it back to the earth. Rinse and stimulate your stones with water by placing them under directly under natural rainfall for 4 to 5 minutes. If it's a dry season, you can also place your stones in a colander and run your stones under a faucet for about 10 minutes. Important to note: Water does have a physical force, so be sure to only clean hard stones such as amethyst, [turquoise](http://amzn.to/1Oig2MH), or quartz with this method. 2. Sunlight or Moonlight Sunlight and moonlight can charge and clean your gemstone. The sun will supply a newly harvested gemstone with yang solar energy that balances the stone's innate yin energy it received from the earth during its creation. For stones that are susceptible to discoloration under the strong sun (such as amethyst, rose quartz or [amber](http://amzn.to/1Oigdrn), you can opt to put them out at dawn for an hour. Important to note: Moonlight is a more delicate (and non color-altering) method that is especially effective with a full moon. Because the moon is at its brightest and full potential when full, it can increase the stone's vibrations. 3. Earth You can use the elements of the earth by burying your stones underground for a full day. Let the earth soak up all the unwanted energies contained within the stones so they are cleansed and refreshed. 4. Fire Power You can use fire or smoke to cleanse your stones by quickly burning your stones or smudging. Direct fire immediately burns away any negative energy and is done in a matter of seconds over a candle. Smudging can be done with [sage sticks](http://amzn.to/1SV03te), [palo santo](http://amzn.to/1WR9jQB), or commercial incense like [sandalwood](http://amzn.to/1s3r9Vq) or [cedar](http://amzn.to/1s3rbwG), which is known to remove negativity. Wave your stone over your smoke source for 20 to 30 seconds to cleanse it while simultaneously purifying your home. 5. Salt Water A salt water bath is one of the most common methods to clean your gemstones. Throughout history, salt has been used in all religions for rituals and as a vehicle to absorb unwanted energy. With this technique, soak your stones overnight in water with a pinch of sea salt. Ideally, if you have access to sea water, you can bring them back to nature and let them sit in the sea in a mesh bag. Make sure to give them a rinse in clear water after the salt bath to remove any residue. Important to note: It is not always advisable to use salt water to cleanse stones as the salt can damage certain delicate stones, such as [hematite](http://amzn.to/1s3rkA0) or [pyrite](http://amzn.to/1SV0oML). 6. Other Stones Certain crystals and clusters (like [quartz](http://amzn.to/1OigESl) or amethyst) have the ability to absorb and regenerate other stones. One of the most popular cleansing crystals that can purify gemstones of their negativity is selenite. To cleanse your stones, lay them on selenite for at least six hours (but the longer the better). Selenite and clear quartz clusters actually amplify the energy of your other stones. They have the ability to absorb, neutralize, and then recharge your stones with higher vibrations. 7. Meditation Yes, you can meditate your way to cleansed stones! There are ways to clean and meditate with your gemstones at the same time. You can balance your own energies during meditation by blowing balanced breath onto your jewels. It's important to state an intention so you can refuel your gemstone after you clean it. If you practice this form of crystal cleansing regularly, it will come naturally. And the calmness of your being will allow for true stone sterilization. Important to note: Do not do this in vain. Make sure you practice this with relaxed and true meditation. A double whammy is to do a meditation-cleanse during a full moon! The Takeaway on How to Cleanse Your Crystals Whether you are in the market for a new stone to add to your collection, or you just want to know how to maintain your existing stones, cleansing your stones regularly is important. The color, texture, and feeling of a stone plays a big role in reflecting a certain season, chakra, and - moreover - your own personality. As mentioned, our own personal vibrations are actually attracted to the stones we need to wear, so take care of your stones like you would yourself. Whatever stone strikes your fancy, just don't forget to start with a good crystal cleanse after "}
