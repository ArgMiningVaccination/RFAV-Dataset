Scripps gynecologists and cancer specialists are experts in detecting precancerous cells before they become cancer, and stopping cervical cancer in its earliest stages. For more advanced cases, our oncology specialists treat cervical cancer with advanced therapies designed to eliminate cancer and prevent recurrence, including minimally invasive surgery that uses small incisions, potentially resulting in shorter hospital stays and a faster recovery, and immunotherapy to harness the power of the body's own immune system. Our multidisciplinary, collaborative board of cancer specialists reviews every patient's care plan to ensure you receive the best possible care from diagnosis to recovery. About cervical cancer Cervical cancer is one of several types of [gynecologic cancers](/services/cancer-care/gynecologic-oncology-treatment), which also include [vaginal cancer](/services/cancer-care/vaginal-cancer-treatment) and [uterine cancer](/services/cancer-care/endometrial-cancer-treatment) (endometrial cancer). Cervical cancer starts in the cells lining the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. It has two parts, each with its own type of cells: - Endocervix is the part of the cervix closest to the uterus and is covered by glandular cells. - Exocervix is located next to the vagina and is covered by squamous cells. Most cervical cancers begin where these two cell types meet, called the transformation zone. As a woman ages, or if she gives birth, the exact location of the transformation zone can change. Most women who develop cervical cancer are between 20 and 50 years old. The disease used to be one of the leading causes of cancer death for American women, but the cervical cancer death rate has dropped by more than 50% over the past four decades. This is due mostly to preventive screening, which can detect precancerous changes that can be removed. Screening also can find cervical cancer at its earliest stages, when treatment can be highly successful. Precancerous cells According to the American Cancer Society, cervical cells do not suddenly become cancerous. Rather, normal cells slowly change and become precancerous. Left untreated, they may become cancer. These precancerous changes may be described as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) or dysplasia. Not all women who have precancerous changes in their cervical cells will develop cervical cancer. Most precancerous changes go away on their own over time. Still, some women with precancerous changes will develop cervical cancer. Usually, it takes several years for precancerous cervical cells to become cancer, but it can happen more quickly in some cases. Types of cervical cancer Cervical cancers can begin in different cell types. The most common types of cervical cancer are the following: Squamous cell carcinoma Up to 90% of cervical cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, which develop in the cells that line cervix. Adenocarcinoma About 10% to 20% of cervical cancers are adenocarcinomas, which develop in gland cells that produce cervical mucus. Mixed carcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma In some cases, cervical cancers have both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Other types of cancer found in the cervix are rare, such as neuroendocrine, melanoma, sarcoma and lymphoma. Cervical cancer causes, risks and family history Researchers don't know exactly what causes cervical cancer. Some viruses can cause the cells to grow out of control and become cancerous, but not every woman who's infected with these viruses develops cervical cancer. There are several known risk factors for cervical cancer. Keep in mind that many women with these risk factors never develop cervical cancer, and some women who do have the disease have no risk factors. Cervical cancer risk factors include: Human papillomavirus (HPV) HPV infection is the cause of almost all cases of cervical cancer, as well as many vaginal and [vulvar cancers](/services/cancer-care/vulvar-cancer-treatment), and is the greatest risk factor for cervical cancer. HPV may cause precancerous changes in the cells of the cervix. If not treated, these cells may become cancerous. For more on HPV, scroll down to the bottom of this section. Age Cervical cancer usually affects women ages 20 to 50, and the risk increases with age. It's found most often in women over the age of 40, but younger women often have precancerous cell changes that require treatment. Smoking Women who smoke have about twice the risk of developing cervical cancer as nonsmokers, especially in women with HPV. Sexual behavior Certain types of sexual activity may increase the risk of HPV infection, including having multiple sexual partners and having unprotected sex. Not having regular Pap tests The Pap test can detect changes in cervical cells before they become cancerous and can also detect cervical cancer at early, highly treatable stages. Women who do not have Pap tests on a regular basis as recommended by their physician have a higher risk of developing cervical cancer, because precancerous cell changes are not detected early and may become cancer. Chlamydia Infection with the sexually transmitted disease (STD) chlamydia may raise cervical cancer risk. Chlamydia is a bacterial infection that often has no symptoms, and women may not know they're infected unless their physician tests them. Exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) before birth The drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) was used between 1940 and 1971 to help prevent miscarriages. Women whose mothers were treated with DES during pregnancy have a high risk of vaginal and cervical cancers. Weakened immune system Women who have weakened immune systems due to HIV infection, drugs that suppress the body's immune system response (such as drugs taken for an autoimmune disease) or other reasons have an increased risk of cervical cancer. Long-term use of birth control pills Long-term use of oral contraceptives can increase risk, and risk increases the longer the pill is used. The risk decreases when pills are stopped, and reaches normal levels about 10 years after stopping. Multiple full-term pregnancies Women who have carried three or more pregnancies to term have a higher risk of cervical cancer. First full-term pregnancy before 17 Women who were younger than 17 years old when they had their first full-term pregnancy have almost twice the risk of cervical cancer as women who became pregnant at age 25 or later. Weight Excess weight can increase the risk of adenocarcinoma of the cervix. Diet Eating a diet low in fruits and vegetables may increase the risk. Family history Women whose mother or sister had cervical cancer have two to three times the normal risk for the disease. Researchers don't know if this is due to an inherited condition, or if family members are more likely to share the same non-genetic risk factors. If you have risk factors for cervical cancer and are concerned about your health, talk with your doctor. If you have family members who have had vulvar cancer, consider talking with one of our genetic counselors. More on human papillomavirus (HPV) HPV is a group of more than 150 related viruses that can infect cells lining the genitals, anus, mouth and throat. The virus is spread from one person to another during skin-to-skin contact, including sex. About two-thirds of all cervical cancers are caused by HPV 16 and 18. Up to 80% of men and women who have had sex have HPV. In 9 out of 10 cases, the body's immune system clears the virus on its own, and most women with HPV will not develop cervical cancer. But if the infection becomes chronic, the risk of cervical cancer increases. A vaccine series is available for HPV and is recommended for pre-teens between the ages of 11 and 12. In some cases, the vaccine may be recommended up to age 26. Cervical cancer prevention, screenings and early detection Cervical cancer screening has proven to detect the disease early. More than 90% of US women diagnosed and treated for stage IA cervical cancer survive five years or more. Types of preventive screenings for cervical cancer The two types of preventive screening for cervical cancer are the Pap test and HPV DNA test. Pap test The Pap test (also known as a Pap smear) can find abnormal cervical cells. It's a fast, painless test that involves gently scraping cells from the opening of the cervix. Cells are then examined under a microscope. Not only can the test identify cervical cancer at an early stage, it can detect changes in cells even before they become cancer. The Pap test is usually performed as part of an annual well-woman exam, and is fast and painless. HPV DNA test The HPV DNA test determines whether a woman is infected with the HPV virus, which is a major risk factor for cervical cancer. This test can be combined with the Pap test. When to get screened For women 30 and older, screening with both an HPV test and a Pap test at the same time is more likely to find abnormal cervical cell changes than either test performed alone, according to the National Cancer Institute. Be sure to discuss the best approach for your individual care with your doctor. How often you should get screened depends on three factors: - Your age - Whether you have had a hysterectomy - Whether you have an increased risk for cervical cancer Recommended screenings by age group The following screening recommendations apply to most women. If you've had a hysterectomy or have an increased risk of cervical cancer, your recommendations may differ (see below). - Age 21 to 29: Pap test every three years. - Age 30 to 64: Pap test and HPV test every five years, or Pap test every three years. - Age 65 or older: If you've had no unusual Pap or HPV test results in the past 10 years, you may not need additional exams. If you have been diagnosed with precancers, you should continue to be screened for at least 20 years after your initial diagnosis. Screening for women who have had a hysterectomy For women who have had a hysterectomy, but have not had cervical cancer or severe cervical dysplasia, screening recommendations depend on whether the cervix was removed during the hysterectomy. - If your hysterectomy included removal of the cervix, ask your doctor whether you should continue screening. - If your cervix was not removed, you should have a Pap test and HPV test every five years. Screening for women at increased risk Women at increased risk may need to start screening at an earlier age, get additional tests or be tested more often. You're at increased risk for cervical cancer if you have any of the following: - History of severe cervical dysplasia, which is a precancerous condition - Persistent HPV infection after age 30 - An immune system that doesn't function properly, such as after an organ transplant or if you take medication to suppress your immune system - History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - Diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure before birth If you may be at increased risk, talk with your doctor about your screening recommendations. Preventive factors Cervical cancer cannot be completely prevented, you can take some steps to help with cervical cancer prevention: - Have Pap tests and HPV tests as recommended - Ask your doctor about an HPV vaccine - Use condoms during sex to protect against STDs - Maintain a healthy weight - Avoid tobacco - Eat a diet high in fruits and vegetables - Discuss oral contraceptive use with your doctor Cervical cancer symptoms, diagnosis and stages Most women have no cervical cancer symptoms in the early stages of the disease, which is why screening is so important. As with most cancers, the earlier cervical cancer is found, the greater the likelihood of successful treatment. Learn more about symptoms, imaging and diagnostic testing, and the stages of cervical cancer below. Cervical cancer symptoms Symptoms of cervical cancer may include: - Vaginal discharge tinged with blood - Vaginal bleeding after sex - Vaginal bleeding after menopause or between menstrual periods - Excessively heavy or long periods - Pain during sex Keep in mind that you can have any of these symptoms and not have cervical cancer. Vaginal infections and hormonal changes can cause similar symptoms. But discuss any symptoms with your doctor to find potential problems. Diagnostic testing If you have an abnormal screening exam or potential symptoms, your doctor may recommend additional tests to confirm or rule out a cervical cancer diagnosis. Scripps cancer specialists diagnose and stage cervical cancer using advanced imaging and diagnostic techniques. Staging helps determine the best course of treatment. Cervical cancer diagnostic tests may include: Colposcopy During a colposcopy, the physician uses an instrument called a colposcope to examine the magnified surface of the cervix. The colposcope remains outside of the body. Hysteroscopy Hysteroscopy is the insertion of a small telescope into the cervix for a physician to view the uterus. Cervical biopsy During a biopsy, the doctor removes a tissue sample from the cervix to be examined under a microscope. There are several types of cervical biopsies, performed through the vagina: - Endocervical curettage (ECC) is when a tissue sample is scraped from an area just past the opening of the cervix using a curette (small, spoon-shaped instrument) or a thin, soft brush. - LEEP (loop electro-surgical excision procedure) is when a small wire heated with low-voltage, high-frequency radio waves is used to remove cells from the cervix. - Cone biopsy is when a cone-shaped sample of tissue is removed and examined for abnormal cells in the tissue beneath the surface. Cystoscopy or proctoscopy Cystoscopy or proctoscopy is the insertion of slender tubes with lights and/or lenses that allow doctors to see if cervical cancer has spread to nearby organs. Computed tomography (CT) scan A [CT scan](/services/imaging/computed-tomography) is an imaging test that captures images of the body from different angles. The images are combined to create detailed cross-sectional views of organs, bones and blood vessels. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [MRI](/services/imaging/mri) relies on a powerful magnet, radio waves and advanced digital technology to provide detailed images of organs, bone and soft tissue. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan A [PET scan](/services/imaging/pet) involves a type of radioactive sugar that existing cancer cells will quickly absorb so they can be identified under a special camera. It's combined with a CT scan to give physicians the ability to view a picture of potentially cancerous areas through the PET while also seeing more detailed images from a CT scan. Lymph node dissection Using minimally invasive surgical techniques, lymph nodes are removed to determine if cancer has spread. Cervical cancer stages Cervical cancer stages indicate how far cancer may have spread beyond the cervix and into other areas of the body. Staging cervical cancer helps doctors plan the best course of treatment. Stage 0 Abnormal cells are in the inner lining of the cervix and may become cancer. Stage 0 also is called carcinoma in situ. Stage I Stage I cervical cancer is in the cervix only. Stage I is divided into several substages based on how far the cancer has spread. - Stage IA is when a small amount of cancer is in the tissues of the cervix and is visible only with a microscope. - Stage IA1 is when cancer is not more than 3 mm deep and not more than 7 mm wide. - Stage IA2 is when the cancer is more than 3 but not more than 5 mm deep and not more than 7 mm wide. - Stage IB is when cancer is more than 5 mm deep or more than 7 mm wide, or it can be seen without a microscope. - Stage IB1 is when cancer can be seen without a microscope and is not larger than 4 cm. - Stage IB2 is when cancer can be seen without a microscope and is larger than 4 cm. Stage II Stage II cervical cancer has spread beyond the cervix, but not to the tissues that line the pelvic wall. Stage II is divided into two substages. - Stage IIA is when cancer has spread beyond the cervix to the upper two thirds of the vagina, but not to tissues around the uterus. - Stage IIB is when cancer has spread beyond the cervix to the upper two thirds of the vagina and to tissues around the uterus. Stage III Stage III cervical cancer is divided into two substages. - Stage IIIA is when cancer has spread to the lower third of the vagina but not to the pelvic wall. - Stage IIIB is when cancer has spread to the pelvic wall and/or the tumor has become large enough to block the ureters that connect the kidneys to the bladder, which can cause the kidneys to become enlarged or stop working. Cancer cells may also have spread to nearby lymph nodes. Stage IV Stage IV cervical cancer has spread to other organs or body parts. It's divided into two substages. - Stage IVA is when cancer has spread to the bladder or rectal wall and may have spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis. - Stage IVB is when cancer has spread beyond the pelvis and pelvic lymph nodes to other places in the body, such as the abdomen, liver, intestinal tract or lungs. Understanding your diagnosis A cervical cancer diagnosis can be upsetting. You may feel frightened, overwhelmed, anxious or sad \u2014 all of which are normal reactions. The more you learn about your diagnosis and next steps, the sooner you can make informed decisions about your treatment. Questions and considerations Here are some questions you may want to ask your doctor or health insurance provider regarding your cervical cancer diagnosis: - Should I get a second opinion? - How do I find a specialist? - What is my cancer treatment plan? - Will I have to miss work/school? - What are the side effects of cervical cancer treatment? - How successful is my treatment likely to be? - What costs will be covered by insurance? - Which costs will I be responsible for? Your [Scripps team](/services/cancer-care/why-scripps/cancer-team) is here to help you find the answers you need to take an active role in your care. In addition, there are a number of community resources that provide education, information and helpful resources \u2014 often at no cost.

Cervical cancer treatment options at Scripps MD Anderson Your [Scripps MD Anderson cancer care team](/services/cancer-care/why-scripps/cancer-team) will customize your treatment plan based on several factors, including: - The cancer stage - Whether cancer has spread - Whether you plan to become pregnant - Your age and overall health If you're diagnosed with cervical cancer during pregnancy, your treatment also will depend on how far along you are. If you're in your third trimester, or if your cancer is found at an early stage, your team may recommend delaying treatment until after your baby is born. Cervical cancer surgery Scripps physicians may use several surgical procedures to remove precancerous cells, or early-stage cervical cancers that have not spread. These include: - Cryosurgery (cryotherapy) is when an instrument is inserted through the vagina to allow the surgeon to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue. - Laser surgery is when the surgeon uses a laser beam to destroy abnormal cells. - LEEP (loop electro-surgical excision procedure) is when a small wire heated with low-voltage, high-frequency radio waves is used to remove cells from the cervix. - Cone biopsy, also called conization, can be performed for early-stage cervical cancers. For cervical cancer that has spread beyond the cervix, more extensive surgery may be needed. Surgical options may include: - Trachelectomy is when surgeons remove the cervix, upper part of the vagina and nearby lymph nodes. The uterus is not removed, which allows a woman to still become pregnant. - Hysterectomy is the removal of the uterus and possibly the cervix. Whenever possible, Scripps surgeons perform [hysterectomy using single-site robotic surgery](/services/surgery/minimally-invasive-robotic-surgery/robotic-gynecologic-surgery/robotic-hysterectomy), which requires just one small incision. If this isn't appropriate, our surgeons can perform the hysterectomy through an abdominal incision, through the vagina or through minimally invasive procedures, such as laparoscopic surgery or [robotic-assisted surgery](/services/surgery/minimally-invasive-robotic-surgery). - Lymph node dissection is when surgeons remove lymph nodes from the pelvic region and the area next to the heart's aorta to see if the cancer has spread. This can be performed through a minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery. - Pelvic exenteration is the most extensive surgical approach and is typically used for recurrent cervical cancer. It involves removal of the uterus, cervix, bladder, vagina, rectum and possibly part of the colon, based on how far the cancer has spread. With pelvic exenteration, the following organs may be involved: - If the bladder is removed, the surgeon may use a piece of intestine to form a new bladder, and urine may be drained through a catheter (tube) into a small plastic bag worn outside of the body. - If the rectum and part of the colon are removed, you may have an opening on the abdomen that allows solid waste (stool) to pass into a small bag worn on the outside of the body, called a colostomy. In some cases, the surgeon may be able to reconnect the colon, so no colostomy is needed. - If the vagina is removed, the surgeon may be able to make a new one from other tissue. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy may be used to treat cervical cancers that have spread beyond the cervix, or to shrink large tumors before surgery. Scripps radiation oncologists use advanced [radiation therapy](/services/cancer-care/radiation-therapy) techniques that precisely target tumors while minimizing radiation exposure to nearby healthy tissues and organs. - High-dose brachytherapy is internal radiation therapy in which radioactive material is inserted through the vagina and placed near the tumor for a few minutes at a time. Radioactive implants may be given alone or with a shortened course of external beam radiation therapy. - Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced form of radiation therapy that allows the radiation oncologist to specify the dose of radiation for the tumor while restricting the dose to surrounding healthy tissues. Chemotherapy [Chemotherapy](/services/cancer-care/chemotherapy) may be given as a primary treatment for metastatic cervical cancer (cancer that has spread) or for cervical cancer that returns. It also may be used combination with radiation therapy. Cervical cancer clinical trials Some cervical cancer treatment plans may involve clinical trials. Talk with your physician about whether a clinical trial is right for you. For a list of clinical trial that are currently enrolling patients, see our [current list of clinical trials](/research/active-studies).
