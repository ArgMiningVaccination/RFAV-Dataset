These PCCRP guidelines/protocols are chaired by Dr. Deed E. Harrison, ICA Representative from Nevada. The PCCRP has an executive panel of 4 chiropractic researchers including: Dr. Donald Harrison (ICA Board Member), Dr. Christopher Kent (WCA Board Member), Dr. Joseph Betz (ICA Representative from Idaho), and Dr. Paul Oakley (Ontario Chiropractic Assoc. Member) and a larger panel of 20 Chiropractic Clinical Experts, who all aided in the development, literature searches, writing, editing, and reviewing these new PCCRP X-ray Guidelines. If you are a licensed DC and you take x-rays for the analysis of spinal subluxation, then you need to take action and we need your assistance. The PCCRP X-ray guidelines were developed by Chiropractors and Chiropractic Organizations for Practicing Clinicians and their Patients. The PCCRP guidelines are in direct competition/opposition to current attempts to restrict Chiropractic Radiography to \"Red Flag Only\" conditions or diagnosis. Do you want to be outside the 'standard of care' for taking 'routine' x-rays for subluxation assessment and post-treatment radiographs? If not please review the PCCRP guidelines and COMPLETE THE SURVEY in the UPPER RIGHT HAND TAB ON THIS PAGE. The PCCRP guideline committee performed a comprehensive literature search (1963 references in total) and prepared the 350 page document. The PCCRP guidelines are the Evidence Based Support for subluxation analysis via x-ray as performed by a large percentage of practicing chiropractors. There are 2 Internal and 5 External Reviews that are being performed to improve the PCCRP guidelines. The purpose of placing the PCCRP draft on this web site is for profession-wide review (1 of the 5 External Reviews) and to seek comments to improve the PCCRP guidelines. We ask you, the reader, to provide your name and email as we do not wish to have non-DC reviewers and we will discount multiple surveys from the same source. We need ALL Chiropractic Clinicians to evaluate the PCCRP X-ray guidelines and complete the survey for us in THE UPPER RIGHT HAND TAB ON THIS PAGE. Without a large number of completed surveys from Practicing Chiropractors, these guidelines will not have great impact. The PCCRP committee did their part and now it's time for Practicing Chiropractors to assist by completing the SURVEY.
