VFC Vaccines California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 7 Vaccines Overview The VFC Program supplies all ACIP -recommended vaccines at no cost to enrolled public and private providers who serve VFC -eligible children from birth through 18 years of age. Providers are required to offer all age -appropriate vaccines \u2014including flu \u2014according to patient populations served. Available Vaccines & Schedules Table 1 lists the ACIP vaccine recommendations1 available through the VFC Program for children from birth through 18 years of age. For schedules, refer to ACIP's \"Birth -18 Years and \"VFC Vaccine Fact Sheets\"4 for one-page flyers about routine schedules, minimum intervals , approved age ranges, and more for each available vaccine. TABLE 1. ACIP -recommended vaccines for children from birth through 18 years of age Vaccine Description DTaP Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis DTaP -HepB -IPV* Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis , hepatitis B , and polio DTaP -IPV* Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and polio DTaP -IPV/Hib* Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, and Haemophilus influenzae type b HepA Hepatitis A HepB Hepatitis B Hib Haemophilus influenzae diphtheria Tdap Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis VAR Varicella (chickenpox) * Combination vaccines. In order to reduce the number of shots children must receive to stay current with ACIP -recommended immunizations, manufacturers combine two or more vaccines (that are available to be administered separately) into one shot. Refer to the \"Immunization Schedule with Combination Vaccines\"5 for more details. THE VFC PROGRAM 8 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Understanding ACIP Vaccine Recommendations In 2010, ACIP adopted a graded approach that classifies vaccine recommendations into two categories ,6 both of which are covered under the Vaccines for Children Program. Routine vaccine recommendations . This recommendation (formerly known as \"universal\") applies to all persons in an age- or risk-factor -based group .7 For example, t he meningococcal conjugate vaccine is routinely recommended for all preteens 11 through 12 years of age.8 All children in this population should be routinely vaccinated. VFC providers agree to order and administer all ACIP -recommended vaccines to VFC - eligible children . Routine vaccine recommendations are identified on ACIP schedules with the following keys: Non -routine vaccine recommendations . This recommendation (formerly known as \"permissive\")7 does not apply to everyone but instead identifies opportun ities for the clinic ian to discuss with the patient or parent/guardian whether a particular vaccine is appropriate based on risks, benefits, and the desire to be protected from a specific disease .8 For example, according to ACIP 's recommendation, people 16 through 23 years of age (preferred age of 16 through 18) \"may be given\" the vaccine against meningococcal serogroup B disease. MenB is classified as non-routine because there insufficient evidence to suggest that all children 16 through 18 be vaccinated, but there was enough evidence to suggest that adolescents and young adults be given the choice.8 VFC providers agree to e nsure that VFC -eligible children have access to non -routine, ACIP -recommended vaccines when indicated or when requested by patients . Non -routine vaccine recommendations are identified on the ACIP schedules with the following key: Introducing New Vaccines into the VFC Program New vaccines are incorporated into the national VFC Program only after careful review and consideration by ACI P, which reviews vaccine efficacy data and considers each vaccine's risks and benefits, the number of doses in a series, the recommended schedule, and contraindications. ACIP then votes whether or not to include each new vaccine. VFC resolutions. ACIP's o fficial decision regarding the incorporation of new vaccines in to the VFC Program is called a VFC resolution. VFC resolutions are available on CDC's \"VFC - ACIP Vaccine Reso lutions\" .9 Vaccine distribution. Once a VFC resolution is passed, CDC begins the process of making the vaccine available through the VFC Program. CDC negotiates prices for bulk vaccine purchase at the national level, vaccine supplies are assessed, and each state is typically allocated an initial supply during the vaccine's introductory period. Ordering guidelines are developed and Vaccine Information Statements (VIS s) are produced. The entire process might take several weeks to a few months. VFC Vaccines California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 9 Provider notifications. The California VFC Program communicates all new vaccine information to enrolled providers \u2014 including the dosing schedule, administration, billing, and ordering information \u2014through e -mailed VFC Program letters. Best Practices . Providers are strongly encouraged to discuss with staff all new products \u2014including formulations, schedules, vaccine administration, and storage \u2014prior to ordering the product and especially before using it on patients. Vaccine Availability California offers a choice of vaccine brands and presentations (e.g., single -dose vial s or manufacturer -filled , single -dose syringes) \u2014except for influenza vaccine . Availability might vary due to supply issues and timing of the introduction of new vaccines. The most current list of vacc ines and formulations are listed on the MyVFCvaccines.org online order form. Vaccine status updates are posted on EZIZ.org . Special Note: Influenza Vaccine The VFC Program requires providers to provide pediatric influenza vaccine s to their VFC - eligible patients during influenza season. Providers are responsible for formulating a vaccination plan to ensure children in their practice or clinic are protected. VFC providers do not have a choice of influenza vaccine brands and packaging. Instead, the VFC Program, in coordination with CDC, selects influenza products and formulations to meet the needs of VFC providers for each flu season . The VFC Program will issue special instructions regarding availability, brands, and ordering of influenza vaccines in advance of each flu season. VFC's \"Pediatric/Adult Influenza Vaccine\"10 provides guidance on schedules and available brands and presentations. (Refer to \"Ordering Flu Vaccines.\" ) The California Mercury -Free Vaccines Act The California Mercury -Free Vaccines Act of 2004 , Chapter 837, Statutes of 2004 (AB 2943, Pavley)11 prohibits administ ration of mercury -containing vaccines to pregnant women, or children younger than three years of age. Thimerosal , a chemical used to prevent contamination of multi -dose vials of vaccines, contains trace amounts of mercury. All routine childhood vaccines, including VFC -supplied vaccines, are available in formulations that meet the Mercury Free Act. All multi -dose via ls of influenza vaccine currently exceed the legal limit of mercury content and should not be used in these groups. VFC's p reservative -free influenza vaccine formulations should be used for administration to VFC -eligible children younger than 3 years of ag e and pregnant teens younger than 19 years of age. Refer to \"Thimerosal\"12 or \"Thimerosal and Vaccines\"13 for more information. Temporary exemptions. California Health and Safety Code Section 124172 subdivision (c) permits the Secretary of the Health and Human Services Agency to temporarily exempt the use of a vaccine from section 124172 under certain circumstances , such as severe delays or shortages of thimerosal -free influenza vaccines . In such events, CDPH will communicate with providers.

Click to Return Home Chapter One Program Requirements California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 11 Program Requirements Overview In exchange for federally funded vaccines, enrolled providers agree to partner with the VFC Program to ensure that federal and state requirements are met in order to protect the integrity of the program as well as the provider's vaccines and patients . Take the EZIZ training \"VFC Program Requirements\" lesson1 for an overview of the program. Program Requirements VFC P rogram requirements , which are explained throughout this manual , are summarized in \"Program Participation Requirements at a Glance\"2 and defined in the VFC \"Provider Agreement\"3 (federal agreement) and California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum.\"4 Table 2 highlights key compliance areas covered by these requirements documents . TABLE 2 . General description of provider requirements Requirement General Description Provider profile Estimate populations served annually (VFC and private ) Eligibility screening & documentation Conduct patient eligibility screening and documentation at every immunization visit ACIP -recommended vaccines Comply with ACIP recommendations and offer age -appropriate vaccinations according to population served Record retention Maintain all VFC -related documentation for three years No-cost vaccines Immunize all VFC -eligible children at no charge to the patient Vaccine administration fee Follow VFC requirements for administration fee caps or reimbursement rate s; don 't deny vaccines due to inability to pay VISs Distribute current Vaccine Information Statements before administering vaccines Vaccine management Store , manage, order, transfer, and return vaccines according to the California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum;\"4 complete VFC \"Vaccine Management Plan\" Word template5 Fraud & abuse Follow VFC Program requirements in a manner to avoid fraud & abuse Site visits Agree to scheduled compliance and unannounced storage & handling visits, and make changes per VFC findings Accountability Track and document vaccine usage; r eplace VFC vaccines deemed non -viable due to provider negligence on a dose -for- dose basis . Recertification Reaffirm annually that VFC Program requirements will be met, key practice information is up to date, and patient estimates are provided. Failure to recertify might result in temporary suspension of prov ider account and termination of agreement . Reviewing Immunization Records California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 11 Reviewing Immunization Records Overview Providers must use screening results to ensure that only VFC -eligible children receive VFC vaccines. To comply with VFC Program requirements and avoid missed immunization opportunities, providers must review immunization records at each immunization visit and ensure all VFC -eligible children receive all age-appropriate , ACIP - recommended immunization s. Ensuring that accurate immunization records are assessed is one essential strategy for raising immunization levels among the provider's patients. Immunization registries are excellent tools to assess immunization status and history . Target Audience Typically licensed providers, nurse practitioners, and other simil ar roles ; Immunization Champion Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Screen patients and document eligibility status at each immunization visit for VFC eligibility and administer VFC -purchased vaccine by such category only to children who are 18 years of age or younger who meet one or more of the VFC eligibility criteria ( VFC \"Provider Agreement \" #2). For the vaccines identified and agreed upon in the provider's VFC Provider Profile, c omply with immunization schedules , dosages and contraindications that are established by ACIP and included in the VFC program (P.A. #3). Discretion may be exercised if in the provider's medical judgment, and in accordance with accepted medical practice, the provider deems such compliance to be medically inappropriate for the child, or if the particular requirements contradict state law, including laws pertai ning to religious and other exemptions (P.A. #3). Never deny administration of a publicly purchased vaccine to an established patient because the child's parent/guardian/individual of record is unable to pay the administration fee (P .A. #7). Best Practices Consider using the AAP \"Refusal to Vaccinate\" form1 (or equivalent) to document provider's efforts to vaccinate despite patient/parent refusal . Consider using an immunization information system . They are directly related to increasing and maintaining vaccination rates2 and result in cost savings to practices performing administrative tasks .3 Strongly r ecommend to parents all vaccines currently du e. According to CDC, \"Parents of pediatric patients are likely to follow vaccine recommendations of the child's doctor, and even adults who were initially reluctant were likely to receive an influenza vaccination when the health -care provider's opinion of the vaccine was positive.\"2 For multi -dose series, encourage the parent/guardian or patient to make a follow -up appointment for the next dose before leaving. Ensure staff are familiar with ACIP recommendations ; print and display immunization schedules for staff and parents . Consider these CDC best practices : Reinforce the need to return for future doses.2 Recommend that families leave with the next appointment booked.2 Issue reminder calls that vaccines are soon due.2 PATIENT VACCINATIONS 12 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Procedure Incorporate these instructions into existing practice protocols to review immunization histories in compliance with VFC Program requirements and best practices for children who present for vaccin ation . TABLE 5 . Instructions for reviewing immunization recor ds Step Description 1. Review the child's permanent immunization record (electronic or paper) at every immunization visit for VFC -eligible children. No access to an immunization registry or EHR/EMR? Consider using CDPH \"Immunization Record and History\" form .4 2. Determine which vaccines are recommended by comparing the child's immunization record to ACIP's \"Birth -18 Years Recommended Immunization Schedule\" .5 A. Review the ACIP \"Catch -up Immunization Schedul e\"6 if the child is not up to date . 3. Recommend all ACIP -recommended, age-appropriate vaccines (unless provider feels vaccinations are medically inappropriate in accordance with accepted medical practice or as exempted by state law). A. Request that the parent complete the AAP \"Refusal to Vaccinate\" form1 (or equivalent) if appropriate. 4. Ensure that VFC -eligible children have access to non -routine, ACIP - recommended vaccines when indicated or when requested. A. Answer any questions to help the patient or parent/guardian determine whether a non -routine vaccine is appropriate based on risks, benefits, and the desire to be protected from a specific disease. 5. Reinforce the need to leave with the next immunization visit scheduled. A. Use written and verbal reinforcements, and tie the visit to some calendar event (e.g., the child's next birthday or some holiday). 6. Document a written medical order (electronic or paper) in the child's permanent medical record for the vaccinator. A. Indicate whether vaccines are to be administered from private or VFC stock.

Click to Return Home Chapter Two PATIENT VACCINATIONS 14 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Administering Vaccines Overview Providers must ensure eligibility status is clearly identified for staff administering vaccine s. Administering vaccines is more than simply the injection. It's a process that includes selecting the prescribed vaccines from the correct funding source based on the written order, preparing the vaccines , verifying the correct dose and vaccine for age, giving them to or injecting them into the patient, and documenting the doses administered in the child's permanent medical record. Target Audience Typically clinical staff ; Immunization Champion Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: I will screen patients and document eligibility status at each immunization encounter for VFC eligibility (i.e., fede rally or state vaccine -eligible) and administer VFC -purchased vaccine by such category only to children who are 18 years of age or younger who meet one or more of the following categories: Are an American Indian or Alaska Native; Are enrolled in Medicaid; Have no health insurance; Are underinsured (VFC \"Provider Agreement\" #2). Providers must maintain all records related to the VFC Program (including medical records that verify receipt of vaccine) fo r a minimum of three years and upon request make these records available for review ( P.A. #4). Distribute the current Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) each time a vaccine is administered and maintain records in accordance with the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), which includes reporting clinically significant adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) (P .A. #8). Administer all ACIP -recommended vaccines (including flu) in -house; do not refer patients to other facilities where they might be charged for vaccine administration (California VFC Program \"Provider A greement Addendum\" #14A) . non -routine , ACIP -recommended vaccines when indicated or when requested (P.A.A. #14B). Administer all VFC -supplied vaccines at the approved location for the VFC PIN; administration of doses outside the approved location (e.g., special event clinics, health fairs, special school clinics, or mass vaccination clinics) is not routinely allowed and requires prior approval from the VFC Program (P.A.A. #1 4C). Acknowledge and follow VFC Prog ram and manufacturer guidance, including revaccination, if non -viable vaccines have been administered to patients (P.A.A. #14D). Document all VFC vaccine doses administered -1053F) , an immunization registry, or equivalent electronic or paper form (P.A.A. #14E). Best Practices Ensure vaccinators are properly trained on preparing and administering vaccines to children in the correct anatomic site according to practice protocol. Use an immunization information system such as EMR/EHR system (or immunization registry ) that supports VFC Program documentation requirements to keep track of doses administered (private and publicly funded). Documentation for Minors Unaccompanied by Parent or Guardian Family planning and STD clinics confidentially administering VFC -supplied vaccines to unaccompanied minors must document vaccine administration in the patient's confidential medical record and on a VFC -supplied administration log. Due to the confidential nature of services provided, vaccine administration information cannot be entered into an immunization registry ; so, alternative documentation must be kept. Billing for Vaccine Administration California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 23 Billing Practices Staff must accurately bill based on the eligibility categories as listed in table 8. TABLE 8 . Billing by VFC e ligibility criteria Criterion Description Medicaid eligible (or enrolled) Cost of Vaccine : Do not bill - provided by VFC Admin Fee : Bill Medi -Cal\u2014not the patient . The difference between Medi -Cal's administration fee and the regional fee cannot be billed to patient . For pharmacies, ad ministration fees must be waived because Medi -Cal does not reimburse for pharmacies. American Indian (AI) or Alaskan Native (AN) Cost of Vaccine : Do not bill - provided by VFC Admin Fee : If billing, bill the patient up to but not exceeding the current maximum regional charge set for California by CMS . However, this fee must be waived if the parent or guardian is unable to pay the fee. Uninsured Cost of Vaccine: Do not bill - provided by VFC Admin Fee: If billing, bill the patient up to but not exceeding the current maximum regional charge set for California by CMS . However, this fee must be waived if the parent or guardian is unable to pay the fee. Never bill parents who are unable to pay the waived administration fees. Underinsured Cost of Vaccine : Do not bill - provided by VFC through FQHCs or RHCs ONLY Admin Fee : Medicaid -eligible ? Bill Medi -Cal; Private insurance ? Bill patient/insurance for cost of covered vaccine; otherwise, b ill the patient up to but not exceeding the current maximum regional charge set for California by CMS ; waive the fee if the parent /guardian is unable to pay the fee. Vaccine Administration Fees The p rovider's vaccine administration fee for non -Medi -Cal, VFC -eligible children must not exceed the state/territory vaccine administration fee cap established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS). For current fee caps, refer to http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR -2012 -11-06/pdf/2012 -26507.pdf .1 Providers will no longer be able to bill for the administration fee after the date of service. The provider must waive the administration fee if the patient or parent is unable to pay the fee when the service is received , and the provider cannot bill the patient/parent for any waived administration fees at a later time. Unpaid administration fees may not be sent to collections, and the provider may not refuse to vaccinate an eligible child whose parents have unpaid vaccine administration fees. Providers may still continue to bill for office visits as allowed under VFC policy, and unpaid bills related to office visit fees or other fees (e.g., labs) may be sent to collections . PATIENT VACCINATIONS 24 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Other Fees In addition to vaccine administration fees, providers may charge other visit -related fees such as office visit fees. These fees should be clearly identified in the bill and thoroughly explained to prevent any confusion, misunderstandings, or allegatio ns of abuse of publicly purchased vaccines. Fees for Combination Vaccines A combination vaccine, even if it contains several antigens, is considered one vaccine dose. The regional vaccine administration fee cap rates are established on a per -vaccine basis \u2014not a per -antigen or per -component basis . Billing with Medi - Cal as Secondary Insurance Insured children with Medi -Cal as a secondary insurance are VFC -eligible as long as they are enrolled in the state's Medi -Cal program. Billing might be done in either of two ways , as instructed by the provider or supervisor : 1. If vaccine was administered from private stock . Bill the patient's primary insurance for vaccine cost and administration. If the carrier denies payment, the provider may bill Medi -Cal for the administration fee and contact the VFC Call Center to request approval to repl ace private doses used with VFC -supplied vaccines. A copy of the carrier's denial m ust be submitted with the request. 2. If vaccine was administered from VFC doses . Bill Medi -Cal for the vaccine administration fee. There is no out -of-pocket expense for the parent or guardian with this option. Important. Providers are encouraged to choose fr om the vaccine inventory that is most cost -effective for the family and train their staff accordingly. Questions? For questions about billing for vaccine administration, contact Med -Cal directly.

Click to Return Home Chapter Vaccine Storage Unit Specifications California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 9 Vaccine Storage Unit Specifications Overview Vaccine storage units act as an insurance policy to protect patient s from administration of damaged vaccine s and protect practices and clinics from costly vaccine replacement due to negligent loss . Because providers might maintain an average vaccine inventory ranging from tens of thousands to more than $500,000 over the course of a year , investing in reliable storage units that meet VFC P rogram requirements will likely cost less than replacing spoiled vaccines. Target Audience Provider of Record and Designee, Vaccine Coordinator & Backup Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Never store vaccines in dormitory -style any time ( VFC \"Provider Agreement\" #9B ). Use only refrigerators or freezers that comply with VFC vacc ine storage unit requirements : Very high volume providers must use purpose -built (pharmacy -, biologic -, or laboratory -grade) refrigerators. Other providers may use refrigerators and freezers that are purpose -built (preferred) or commercial -grade (acceptable) . Household -grade , stand -alone units are discouraged. Purpose -built combination units, including auto -dispensing units without doors, are allowed (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreem ent Addendum\" #3A). Acknowledge that manual -defrost freezers are acceptable if the practice has access to an alternate storage unit when defrosting the freezer. The alternate storage unit must comply with VFC vaccine storage unit requirements and be monitored using a VFC -compliant digital data logger . Temporary storage of VFC - supplied vaccines in a cooler is unacceptable (P.A.A. #3B). Neve r use any of the following for vaccine storage: household -grade , combination refrigerator -freezers ; compact , household -grade , stand -alone refrigerators (with capacity 11 cubic feet or less) ; dormitory -style or bar -style combination refrigerator/freezers ; manual -defrost refrigerators ; convertible units ; cryogenic (ultra -low) freezers ; or any vaccine transport unit for routine storage (including coolers and battery -operated units) (P.A.A. #3 C). Purchase new refrigerators (purpose -built) or freezers (any grade) if existing storage units experience frequent temperature excursions jeopardizing vaccines , or malfunctioned resulting in spoiled vaccines (P.A.A. #3D). Best Practice s Use pharmacy -grade units for vaccine storage; they are purpose -built for the storage of biologics and maintain stable temperatures. Providers using pharmaceutical -grade vaccine storage units should consider purchasing a generat or to compensate for electrical -grid insufficiencies as the ir interior temperatures rise more quickly duri ng outages . Purchasing New Storage Units Providers must purchase a new vaccine refrigerator or freezer if vaccine storage units do not m eet VFC Program specifications , or the practice has had storage incidents resulting in spoiled vaccine s. Refurbished units. Purchasing refurbished storage units or those o utside the warranty is discouraged. These units might not be able to maintain stable temperatu res if not properly conditioned, which puts vaccines at risk. VACCINE MANAGEMENT 10 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Key Terms Refrigerators and freezers are available in different types (stand -alone and combination) and grades (pharmaceutical, commercial, and household). Stand -alone. These types are self -contained units designed as either refrigerator -only or freezer -only and ra nge in size from compact to very large pharmaceutical -grade units. FIGURE 3.3. Stand -alone refrigerators . FIGURE 3.4. Stand -alone upright and chest freezers . Combination. These types typically have a refrigerator and freezer with separate exterior doors , though Figure 3.6 depicts a combination unit without doors . FIGURE 3.5. Combination purpose -built storage unit. FIGURE 3. 6. Purpose -built, pharmaceutical -grade, auto - dispensing unit without doors. Purpose -built . These storage units are specifically designed to maintain consistent temperatures for storage of fragile vaccines or biologics. They are available as pharmacy -, biologic -, and laboratory -grades . (See Figure 3.6.) Commercial. These grades are intended to store food and beverages in commercial settings. They are often larger and more powerful than household units but are not designed to store biologics . They experience some temperature fluctuations. Household. These grades are intended for food storage \u2014typically in homes and offices. Vaccine Refrigerator Specifications Providers have agreed to comply with VFC Program vaccine refrigerator specifications. Vaccine refrigerators must meet these requirements: Maintain temperatures between 3 6.0\u00baF and 46.0\u00baF (between 2.0\u00baC and 8.0\u00baC); Have enough space to store all the practice's refrigerated vaccine inventory throughout the year \u2014including during flu and back -to-school seasons; Have enough space to store water bottles to stabilize tem peratures; Defrost automatically; Seal tightly and close properly; Be used primarily for vaccine storage. If necessary, medications or biologic s (not inoculated) may be stored on the shelves below vaccines. Vaccine Storage Unit Specifications California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 11 Vaccine Freezer Specifications Providers have agreed to comply with VFC Program vaccine freezer specifications. Vaccine freezers must meet these requirements: Maintain consistent temperatures between -58.0\u00b0F and +5.0\u00baF (between -50.0\u00b0C and -15.0\u00baC); Be a stand -alone unit; Have enough space to store all the practice's frozen vaccines along with sufficient frozen cold packs to stabilize temperatures; Defrost automatically (manual is acceptable if the practice has access to an alternate storage unit when defrosting the freezer; the alternate storage unit must be able to maintain recommen ded temperatures and be monitored using a VFC -compliant data logger; temporary storage of vaccines in a cooler is unacceptable); Seal tightly and close properly; Be used only for vaccine storage. Acceptable Vaccine Storage Units Refrigerators. Not all refrigerators are designed to maintain proper temperatures that protect vaccine viability. When evaluating existing or shopping for new vaccine refrigerators, refer to table 2 to determine required grade and type by practice volume. TABLE 2.

Any practice Vaccine Storage Unit Specifications California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 13 Unacceptable Vaccine Storage Units Refrigerators with cooling plates or coils are not allowed. T able 4 lists storage units that do not meet VFC Program requirements and may not be used to store VF C-supplied vaccines. TABLE 4. Unacceptable storage units Type Comments Compact household refrigerator (stand -alone) Small, under -the-counter, stand -alone refrigerators with a capacity of 11 cubic feet or less are not allowed. Household combination refrigerator/freezer Household combination units have one compressor with poor temperature control. They can pose a risk to refrigerated vaccines because cold air from the freezer is vented into the refrigerator and can freeze vaccines. The freezer portions of many combination units are not capable of maintaining the consistent temperature for frozen vaccines. Dormitory -style and bar-style combined refrigerator/freezers These units have a single exterior door and an evaporator plate/cooling coil, usually located in an icema ker/freezer compartment. These units pose a significant risk of freezing \u2014even when used for temporary storage. Manual -defrost refrigerators These models have a vertical cooling plate at the back of the refrigerator, which poses potential risk of significant temperature variation and freezing vaccines. Convertible units These units have an internal switch that converts an all - refrigerator unit to an all -freezer unit. Cryogenic freezers These units reach temperatures well below -58.0\u00b0F . Transport units Coolers and battery -operated units may not be used for routine vaccine storage. VACCINE MANAGEMENT 14 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Final Considerations before Purchasing Storage Units Before purchasing a storage unit, make sure it will fit in a space that meets VFC Program requirements and best practices. Vaccine storage units should be placed in rooms with good air circulation; away from public spaces, direct sunlight , and any heat sources; plugged directly into a nearby, dedicated wall outlet that does not have built -in GFI circuit switches and is not controlled by a light switch; and with at least 4 inches of space around the top, back , and sides. The unit to be purchased must have sufficient storage space to accommodate vaccine stock at the busiest time of year without overcrowding. If you are unclear about vaccine storage unit requirements, contact your VFC Field Representative prior to making a purchase. Click to Return Home Chapter Three Monitoring Storage Unit Temperatures California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 47 Repercussions of Improper Temperature Monitoring Vaccines not stored at recommended temperatures might be deemed non -viable and the provider held financially accountable for the spoiled vaccine s. Improper temperature monitoring includes not recording tem peratures, not taking appropriate actions for out - of-range temperatures, and not ensuring staff are adequately trained. Falsifying VFC temperature logs also constitutes improper temperature monitoring. Improper temperature monitoring might include but is not limited to the following consequences: Patients might receive non -viable v accine s and remain unprotected from vaccine - preventable diseases . Patients could need to be recalled and revaccinated, which can take a significant amount of clinic resources, m anpower, and time. Spoiled VFC vaccines and private vaccines could amount to an enormous monetary loss to both the p ractice and to the VFC Program. The provider might be held financially accountable for the spoiled vaccine s; doses lost must be compensated dose by d ose at the private sector cost.

Click to Return Home Chapter Three VACCINE MANAGEMENT 48 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Taking Action for Temperature Excursions Overview Staff must immediately prevent use of vaccines exposed to out -of-range temperatures and notify relevant staff . Any temperature excursion must be documented and reported to MyVFCvaccines . The information reported on storage and handling incidents is used to determine whether a vaccine is likely to be viable and can be administered to patients. Timely and accurate reporting of temperature excursions is essential to a successful determination of vaccine viability. Target Audience Typically Vaccine Coordinator and Backup, or staff designated in the provider's vaccine management plan with responsibilities for monitoring storage unit temperatures Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Take immediate action to prevent vaccine spoilage and correct any improper storage condition for all out -of-range storage unit temperatures (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #11A). Mark as \"Do exposed to out -of-range temperatures (P.A.A. #11B). Download and review temperature data files for every temperature excursion (P.A.A. #1 1C). Accurately document all o ut-of-range temperatures to SHOTS on MyVFCvaccines (P.A.A. #1 1D). Do not administer vaccines until vaccine viability has been determined by vaccine manufacturers (P.A.A. #11E). Transport vaccines in the event of extended power outages or unit malfunctions following the guidelines for proper refrigerated vaccine transport (IMM -983) and frozen vaccine transport (IMM (P.A.A. #1 1F). Reporting Excursions on MyVFCvaccines VFC Program's Storage and Handling Triage System (SHOTS) allows providers to document temperature excursions and details. If vaccine quarantine is needed, the system directs providers to the manufacturers who determine vaccine viability. Never discard vaccines until advised by the practice's VFC Field Representative or the VFC Call Center. In the event of an excursion, providers must provide incide nt details including length of temperature excursion, minimum and maximum temperatures, and possible cause. Manufacturers might request an inventory of the affected vaccines. SHOTS can be accessed at MyVFCvacc ines.org . (Refer to the \"Storage and Handling Triage System (SHOTS) \" job aid1 for details.) Taking Action for Temperature Excursions California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 49 Procedure Follow the step -by-step instructions to report temperature excursions in compliance with VFC Program requirements and best practices. Contact the vendor for questions about data logger use. TABLE 16. Instructions for reporting temperature excursions Step Description If an alarm went off : 1. Clear the MIN/MAX and any alarm symbol. Tip. This step ensures staff don't report the same excursion during the next recording; s kip this step if your device resets automatically. 2. Post the \"Do Not Use Vaccines\" sign to quarantine all vaccines. Tip. This step ensures vaccines are not administered until SHOTS or the vaccine manufacturer determines vaccines are okay to administer . 3. Alert your supervisor that vaccines might have been damaged by out -of-range temperatures and may not be used until the incident has been resolved. 4. Immediately report the temperature excursion to SHOTS at MyVFCvaccines.org and follow all instructions given. A. Download and save the temperature data file to the folder created for the device. (For example, Injection_Room_ FRIDGE \\ 2019 \\JAN.) (Refer to \"Configuring Data Loggers\" for guidance on setting up folders for data storage.) Tip. Specify a filename that includes VFC PIN, storage unit ID, and current date. For example: 012345_ FRIDGE _0116201 9. VACCINE MANAGEMENT 50 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition B. Look in the data file for any excursion details (alarm results that show temperatures outside the device's configured alarm limits). Tip. Refer to the device's product guide or video to learn how to identify temperatures outside the HI/LO alarm limits in the data file . (See image for sample \"A larm Report .\") C. Use the excursion details to r eport the excursion to SHOTS using the instructions provided . Important: If all excursions are not reported to SHOTS, vaccine manufacture rs can't accurately determine vaccine viability, and patients might be left unprotected against vaccine -preventable diseases. 5. After the incident has been reported to SHOTS, r ecord the assigned SHOTS ID in the appropriate column on the temperature log. 6. Return the data logger to its original location and ensure it's now recording storage unit temperatures. Tip. Some devices might need to be reconnected and restarted. Check device product guide for instructions. What to Do If Vaccines Are Damaged When temperature excursions are reported to SHOTS, staff must follow the instructions provided, which could direct staff to contact vaccine manufacturers . Manufacturers will determine if vaccines might have been damaged by out -of-range temperatures. If non -viable vaccines were administered to patients. Providers must follow VFC Program and manufacturer guidance . If any affected vaccines deemed non -viable (unable) were admini stered to patients, please note that the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that any vaccines given after exposure to inappropriate temperatures should generally be repeated. Please consult with the manufacturer of vaccines deemed non-viable for additional vaccine stability studies and other information to help determine provider revaccination plans. Taking Action for Temperature Excursions California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 51 Troubleshooting Most temperature excursions can be prevented. If the data logger indicates that the temperature is outside the recommended range, check the storage unit door, the power supply, the thermostat setting, and the data logger settings. These additional factors might lead to vaccine storage incidents: Inadequate staff training . Action : Review the EZIZ \"Monitoring Storage Unit Temperatures\" lesson2 to address training gaps . Opening storage unit door s frequently (e.g., during busy day s). Action : consider upgr ading to a pharmaceutical -grade unit, which recovers quickly from door openings . Not closing the storage unit door tightly . Action : Make sure door s are closed properly when not in use; check the integrity of door seals as part of routine maintenance. Unplu gging vaccine storage unit s. Action: N ever unplug vaccine storage unit s. Unplanned electrical outage . Action : Follow protocols in the practice's vaccine management plan. Planned electrical outage (e.g., to the room or building) . Action: E nsure the Vaccine Coordinator has been notified before turning off the power; follow the protocols in the practice's vaccine management plan. Taking inventory while storage unit door s remain open . Action : Keep door s shut as much as possible . Normal sto rage unit cycling . Action : Add water bottles (refrigerators) or cold packs (freezer s only ) to help buffer internal temperatures ; if that doesn't work, consider upgrading to a pharmaceutical -grade storage unit . Too much e mpty space in the storage unit . Acti on: Add s ufficient water bottles (refrigerators) or cold packs (freezers only ) to help buffer internal temperatures . Not monitoring storage unit temperatures at all . Action : Follow VFC Program requirements to monitor and document temperatures . Malfunctioning, old, and/or poor quality storage units . Action : Only use vaccine storage units that meet VFC Program requirements. (Refer to \" Vaccine Storage Unit Specifications .\") Turning off or ignoring alarm al erts . Action : Do not ignore alarm alerts. If temperature alarms go off repeatedly, do not disconnect the alarm until it has been confirmed as a false alarm. Unacceptable temperatures during transfers and transport . Action : Use VFC - compliant data logger d uring transport and follow VFC refrigerated3 or frozen vaccines4 transport job aids .

Click to Return Home Chapter Three VACCINE MANAGEMENT 52 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Conducting a Physical Vaccine Inventory Overview Physical vaccine i nventories help practices maintain sufficient doses to meet patient needs by estimating future doses needed for routine periods as well as back -to-school and flu seasons. As part of vaccine management, practices should order proper quantities and use vaccines to prevent expiration. An accurate understandin g of doses on hand helps to prevent over -ordering (doses might expire before use) or under -ordering ( could result in missed vaccination opportunities). Accurate on -hand inventory must be reported with each VFC vaccine order. Target Audience Typically Vaccine Coordinator and Backup Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Providers agree to replace vaccine purchased with federal funds (VFC, 317) that are deemed non -viable due to provider negligence on a dose -for-dose basis (VFC \"Provider Addendum\" #13). Conduct a physical vaccine inventory at least monthly , and before ordering vaccines , using the VFC \"Vaccine Physical Inventory Form\" (IMM -1052) or equivalent electronic or paper form (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #12A). Never borrow VFC -supplied vaccines to supplement private stock, or vice versa (P.A.A. #1 2B). For vaccines that will expire within 6 month s and cannot be used, notify the VFC Call Center prior to transferring to another VFC provider to prevent negligent provider loss (P.A.A. #1 2C). Remove spoiled, expired, and wasted vaccines from storage units after identification to prevent inadvertent use (P.A.A. #1 2D). Report all spoiled, expired, or wasted doses of VFC -supplied vaccines prior to submitting a new vaccine order (P.A.A. #1 2E). Monitor vaccine storage units regularly and purchase additional storage units if capacity cannot accommodate the in ventory in a manner consistent with VFC Program requirements (P.A.A. #1 2F). Rational Because VFC providers might maintain an average vaccine inventory ranging from tens of thousands to more than $500,000 over the course of a year , providers are required to report the number of VFC doses on hand (as well as doses administered) every time they place an order. This system of checks and balances helps practices account for their vaccines on a regular schedule and prevents inadvertent ov er-ordering or under - ordering. Best Practices Check vaccine expiration dates weekly and rotate stock to place vaccines that will expire soonest in front of those with later expiration dates. Create a calendar appointment or task reminder to conduct physical vaccine inventories monthly and before every routine VFC vaccine order. Be mindful that leaving storage unit doors open too long might expose vaccine s to out-of-range temperatures that can damage vaccines . VFC p roviders are strongly encouraged to enroll i n an immunization registry because registries efficiently track vaccine lot numbers and expiration dates, and they can id entify patients to recall in the event of revaccination.

The plan must be readily available in a location known t o staff and reviewed at least annually with all key practice staff. Target Audience Typically Vaccine Coordinator and Backup Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Providers agree to replace vaccine purchased with federal funds (VFC, 317) that are deemed non -viable due to provider negligence on a dose -for-dose basis (VFC \"Provider Agreement \" #13). Maintain a c urrent and completed vaccine management plan (IMM -1122) for routine and emergency situations that includes practice -specific , vaccine - management guidelines and protocols, names of staff with tempera ture monitoring responsibilities, and required EZIZ lesson completion dates for all key practice staff (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #1A ). Transport vaccines in the event of e xtended power outages or unit malfunctions following the guidelines for proper refrigerated vaccine transport (IMM -983) and frozen vaccine tra nsport (IMM -1130) (P.A.A. #1 1F). Rationale Because VFC provider s might maintain an average vaccine inventory ranging from tens of thousands to more than $500,000 over the course of a year , providers must be prepared to respond to emergencies to help ensure that vaccines remain viable and minimize provider liability due to negligence . Best Practices Most emergencies happen suddenly. Practices should be prepared for emergency transport of vaccine by always having the necessary supplies ready: hard -sided cooler frozen water bottles and cold packs digital data logger (or other c ontinuous temperature monitoring device ) bubble wrap Checklist: Before an Emergency Proper preparation for emergency situations is essential to protecting the viability of vaccines. The table below provides a checklist that must be completed to help ensure practices are ready for planned or unexpected situations that might impact vaccines . TABLE 2 2. Checklist of prepar ations before an emergency situation Step Description 1. Maintain current emergency contact information for key practice staff. 2. Maintain current contact information for alternate vaccine storage location(s), including the facility name, address, and telephone number. 3. Be familiar with backup power sources for commercial - and pharmacy -grade storage units. 4. Know the location of the backup d igital d ata logger used for vaccine transport. 5. Stock vaccine packing and transport supplies, including a hard -sided cooler, frozen gel packs, and bubble wrap. Responding to Vaccine -Related Emergencies California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 69 6. Keep copies of the VFC \"Refrigerated Vaccine Transport Log\" and \"Frozen Vaccine Transport Log\" and floor plans (when available) for easy access during a vaccine -relate d emergency. 7. Vaccine Transport Drill: Practice packing the transport cooler using packing supplies and materials that simulate vaccine boxes. Do NOT practice with actual vaccines. Procedure: During an Emergency Due to the risk to vaccines of improper packing and transporting, follow these step -by- step instructions during an emergency to determine whether vaccines should be transported or sheltered in place. TABLE 2 3. Instructions during vaccine -related emergencies Step Description 1. Do not open the storage unit (s). 2. Place a \"DO NOT OPEN\" sign on storage unit(s) and leave door(s) shut to conserve cold air mass. 3. Notify the emergency contacts identified on the vaccine management plan 's \"Worksheet for Emergency Vaccine Management .\" 4. Note the time the outage started and storage unit temperatures (CURRENT, MIN and MAX). 5. Assess the situation to determine the ca use of the power failure and estimate the time it will take to restore power. 6. Take appropriate action. In the event of appliance failure . Place vaccines in any VFC -approved backup storage unit with a VFC -compliant data logger, or transport vaccines to the designated alternate storage facility. (Refer to \"Transporting Vaccines\" for instructions.) For power outages after hours . Report any excursion to SHOTS the next morning and take appropriate action. (Refer to \"Taking action for Temperature Excursions.\") For planned outages expected to be short -term (approximately fewer than 4 hours) .* Monitor storage unit temperature and report any excursions once power has been restored. (Refer to \"Taking action for Temperature Excursions.\") For planned/unplanned outages expected to be longer than approximately 4 hours,* or for an y outage that extends beyond the current business day . Transport vaccines to the designated alternate storage facility. (Refer to \"Transporting Vaccines\" for instructions.) Important. If transport or relocation is not feasible (e.g., alternate location is not available or travel conditions are unsafe ), keep vaccine storage units closed and n otify the VFC Call Center as soon as possible. 7. Monitor vaccine storage unit temperatures until power is restored. 8. Once power has been restored, follow the steps in TABLE 2 4. * Note: Practices using purpose -built (pharmacy -, biologic -, and laboratory -grade) and commercial -grade storage units may need to transport vaccines to an alternate location sooner than 2 hours as temperatures in these units tend to increase faster during power failures if there is no backup power generator .

In 2018, CDC reported overall estimates of flu impact across age groups and risk groups since 2010. Deaths: between 12,000 and 56,000 annually1 Hospitalizations: 140,000 and 710,000 Illnesses: between 9.2 million and 35.6 million annually1 2017 -18 Flu Season This flu season was the first to be classified as high severity for all age groups, and was characterized by record -breaking illness levels, hospitalization rates, and pediatric deaths. Vaccination can offer substantial benefit s and reduce the likelihood of severe outcomes \u2014even when vaccine effectiveness is reduced. FIGURE 4.7. Hospitalization Rates in 2017 -18 Flu Season. How to Respond to Questions of Vaccine Effectiveness The flu vaccine reduces the likelihood of hospitalization and death, \u2014even during years when vaccine effectiveness is reduced. Because the flu virus is constantly mutating, the flu vaccine is constantly evolving as well to anticipate strains of flu that might be circulating during the upcoming flu season . Some seasons the flu vaccine is more effective than others. Tip. If patients have concerns about flu vaccination based on past experience, remind them that the flu vaccine is different each year, and the protection against the burden of disease (missed school or work, flu symptoms, risk of progression to pneumonia) is increased with vaccin ation \u2014even when vaccine effectiveness is reduced. High -Risk Group: Young Children CDC has released results of a study that found flu vac cination significantly reduced the risk of flu -related death for healthy children and those in high -risk groups. Healthy children: 65% reduction of death risk1 High-risk group: 51% reduction o f death risk1 Strongly Recommend Flu Vaccination Consider bundling flu with other routine vaccines. Patients are more apt to be vaccinated against flu if the health -care provider strongly recommends and offers the flu vaccine during the same office visit. By referring a patient outside the medical home, an immunization opportunity is lost, and VFC -eligible children might be charged for any administration fees \u2014if they get vaccinated at all. If Patients Refuse Vaccination Many patients do not understand that flu is a serious illness that can lead to death , particularly in young children . Practices can directly influence vaccination rates in their practices by preparing staff to address common concerns. Tips . If patients refuse vaccinat ion, ask questions to uncover any reasons behind patient concern. Provide answers and recommend vaccination again. If the patient still declines, share an information handout and follow up at their next visit. Preparing Practices to Fight Flu California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 21 Techniques to Improve Vaccination Rates Empo wer all staff to recommend flu vaccination Offer flu vaccination during routine visits Bundle flu with other routine vaccines Use standing orders Assess flu vaccination status at every visit from September through March Send e -mail or phone reminders to patients to make appointments before flu season and follow up as needed Sample Dialogue CDC suggests using their five -point approach (SHARE) to making a strong vaccine recommendation. SHARE the reasons for the flu vaccine. \"This vaccine can protect you a nd your family from getting the flu, which is a serious illness that can lead to hospitalization and even death, particularly in young children . By getting the shot today, you'll be protecting yourself and the people around you.\" HIGHLIGHT positive experie nces. \"The CDC recommends that everyone get a flu vaccine each year. I always get one so I don't pass along the flu along to my patients and family.\" ADDRESS patient questions. \"To answer your question, a flu shot cannot cause the flu. There can be some mi ld side effects, but it can't cause the flu.\" REMIND patients that the flu vaccine protects children and their loved ones. \"Flu activity is going to start to pick up, and CDC says to expect more cases in the coming months. That's why I want to make sure I help protect you and your loved ones.\" EXPLAIN the potential costs of flu . \"It's important to get vaccinated this season because flu vaccination can reduce the likelihood of hospitalization, flu illnesses, doctor visits, and miss ed work and school.\" Notes 1. \"Prepare Your Practice to Fight Flu,\" EZIZ.org, \"http://eziz.org/assets/docs/NCIRDFightFluSlideDeck.pdf .\" Additional resources: \"Make a Strong Flu Vaccine Recommendation ,\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/ vaccination/flu -vaccine - recommendation.htm . Click to Return Home Chapter Four VACCINE ORDERS 22 California VFC Program's POM, 2019 Edition Ordering Flu Vaccines Overview Providers do not order influenza vaccines the same way they ord er routine vaccines. Flu vaccines are allocated to en rolled providers by the VFC Pro gram in advance of the flu season. If additional doses are needed beyond the initial a llocation, providers may request additional doses during the supplemental flu ordering w indow. Target Audience Typically Vaccine Coordinator and Backup Program Requirement s Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: x For the vaccines identified and agreed upon in the provider's V FC Provider Profile, comply with immunization schedules, dosages and contra indications that are established by ACIP and included in the VFC program (P rovider Agreement #3). x Order vaccine approp riate inventories (VFC \"Provider Agreement\" #9A). x Order all ACIP- recommended vaccines (including flu) according to the provider population, category, order frequency, vaccine usage, and on- hand inventory (California VFC \"Provider Ag reement Addendum\" #7A). x Document all \"Daily Usage Log\" (IMM-1053), \"Flu Usage Log\" (IMM-1053F), an registry, or equivalent electronic or paper form (P.A.A. #14F). Rationale Unlike routine pediatric vaccine s, VFC books a set number of fl u doses in advance of the flu season. In order to ensure demand and full utilization of v accines, each provider is allocated doses. Doses must be confirmed by the announced deadl ine or vaccines are released into the general supply . Providers must accurately doc ument flu vaccine usage and account for any return unuse d, expired vaccines from the pr evious season before confirming the current season's allocation. Best Practices Prepare in advance to ensure you r allocations are accurately co nfirmed: x Review with staff the annual VFC Program influenza letter, whic h includes detailed information regarding this season's ACIP influenza vac cination recommendations, product dosage and administration, storage and handling guidelines, and other import ant information. The letter will be released once recommendations are published by CDC. x Ensure that key practice staff responsible for confirming flu allocations are aware of the announced timeline so that allocations are confirmed by the two- week review and confirmation deadline. x Consider your seasonal flu vaccine needs for your VFC-eligible patients; influenza vaccine is routine ly recommended for all VFC- eligible children 6 months through 18 years of age. And children under eight years of age might need two doses of flu vaccine to complete the series. x Ensure that key practice staff fill out the VFC \"Flu Usage Log\"1 (or an immunization registry or EHR/EMR system) to track flu doses adm inistered; vaccines used and on-hand inventory must be accounted for durin g supplemental flu vaccine ordering. Initial Allocations The VFC Program allocates provider doses at the beginning of th e flu season based on x the available vaccine supply (including specific products) pre- booked for distribution to California VFC Program providers, www.EZIZ.org 1 IMM-1242 (12/18) I, on behalf of myself and any and all practitioners associated with this medical office, group practice, Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), health department, community/migrant/rural clinic, hospital, or other entity of which I am the physician -in-chief, medical director or equivalent, agree to comply with all VFC Program requirements listed below. 1.

Conduct regular vaccine transport drills to maintain competency and readiness for emergen cies. H. Immediately report to the VFC Program any changes in key practice staff who have immunization -related responsibilities ; a change in the Provider or Record or Designee requires a signed \"Key Practice Staff Change Request Form \" (IMM -1166 ). 3. Vaccine Storage Units A. Use only refrigerators or freezers that comply with VFC vaccine storage unit requirements : Very h igh volume providers must use purpose -built (pharmacy -, biologic -, or laboratory -grade ) refrigerators . Other providers may use refrigerators and freezers that are purpose -built (preferred ) or commercial -grade (acceptable) . Household - grade , stand -alone units are discouraged . Purpose -built comb ination units , including auto -dispensing units without doors, are allowed . B. Acknowledge that m anual -defrost freezers are acceptable if the practice has access to an alternate storage unit when defrosting the freezer. The alternate storage unit must comply with VFC vaccine storage unit requirements www.EZIZ.org 2 IMM-1242 (12/18) and be monitored using a VFC-compliant digital data logger . Temporary storage of VFC-supplied vaccines in a cooler is unacceptable. C. Never use any of the following for routine vaccine storage: household -grade , combination refrigerator -freezers ; compact , household -grade , stand -alone refrigerators (with capacity 11 cubic feet or less) ; dormitory -style or bar-style combin ation refrigerator/freezers ; manual -defrost refrigerators ; convertible units ; cryogenic (ultra - low) freezers ; or any vaccine transport unit (including coolers and battery -operated units) .
