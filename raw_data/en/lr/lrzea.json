A properly aligned spine can help ease many different physical conditions including, but not limited to, muscle strains, pain in the neck or back, and even headaches or migraines. Chiropractors use a strategic and effective approach in repositioning a misaligned spine back to its correct shape in order to achieve lasting results. How Can Chiropractic Care Help You? Most people are under the impression that chiropractic care is only for back pain. This is a common misconception as issues such as carpal tunnel, work injuries, auto injuries and many others can be treated through a chiropractic-based approach. The History of Chiropractic Care Daniel David Palmer developed the methods of the modern day chiropractic field. The first ever chiropractic patient was a janitor who was partially deaf. Palmer completed a simple spinal adjustment and the janitor claimed his hearing was improved due to the treatment. Palmer went on to open the first school for chiropractic within the next two years. Since 1895, chiropractic care has become one of the most effective non-invasive treatment options for patients living with a wide variety of issues. Spinal adjustments have been used to help people of all ages overcome the discomfort in their lives and allow them to get back to doing the activities they enjoy. What Kind of Training Does a Bentonville Chiropractor Have? In order to become a chiropractor, one must complete a minimum of four years at an accredited chiropractic institution. Before being able to attend chiropractic school, it is required to have an undergraduate degree in a basic science or a number of years of experience in a different but relevant health profession. Students working through the program to become chiropractors must log at least 4,200 hours in the classroom and also must, at minimum, undergo 1,000 hours of supervised training in a clinic. These supervised hours are used to teach how to diagnose specific conditions and what treatment techniques to use in order to bring the body back to its full potential. Our team at Natural State Chiropractic - Bentonville is dedicated to helping you reach optimal health and we look forward to meeting with you in order to design a personalized plan that meets your needs.
