We appreciate the opportunity to assist you in your journey for improving and maintaining good health. We provide a personalized, holistic approach that develops a plan to meet your individual goals and needs. The initial consultation is our opportunity to get to know you and assess your health concerns. During the first visit we will discuss your health history, address chief complaints, perform a form of kinesiology, mini-iridology and run several biofeedback scans dependent upon your chief complaints. Other testing may be needed such as urinalysis, saliva, hair or food allergy testing. These will be discussed, if applicable, at your First Time Evaluation. "}
