Often, they look more like candy, or they come in a vessel overpopulated with clutter and information. Inspired by the growing popularity of natural products around the home, Hilma co-founders Hilary Quartner, Lily Galef, and Nina Mullen set out to create remedies that are backed by science and hold to their clean label standards. Hilma describes its products as being in a new category, \"Clinical Herbal,\" meaning they make supplements with natural ingredients whose efficacy is backed by research and transparent results. Agency [Little Troop](http://littletroop.com/) was brought in to provide full-service design, and they brought much-needed clarity and a human element to the brand's visual identity. Little Troop came to name the brand Hilma with help from agency Human NYC, naming the remedy upstart after the artist [Hilma af Klint](https://www.guggenheim.org/blogs/checklist/who-was-hilma-af-klint-at-the-guggenheim-paintings-by-an-artist-ahead-of-her-time) who was known for her abstract work. You can see Hilma's influence in their logo and visual palette; the organic blues, greens, yellows, and neutrals get accompanied by a Swiss typeface influence along with 60s pharmaceutical aesthetics. The blend of organic and clinical elements conveys Hilma's roots in both natural ingredients and science-based legitimacy. The Swiss Design communicates credibility and confidence, while the colors bring warmth, trustworthiness, and approachability to the brand. The use of a Helvetica-style typeface makes the copy on the packaging appear crisp and legible, further demonstrating Hilma's commitment to making products consumers can understand without having to break out a magnifying glass. While Hilma strives to use packaging that is recycled and/or recyclable, the company also offers customers a more eco-friendly [shipment](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_Sjmk-g4o1/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), which omits marketing materials, the bottle pouch, and ships in 100% recycled low-acid paper. Hilma's mission is to clean up the medicine cabinet by creating remedies void of fillers, synthetic ingredients, or bright colors. The clean and inspired branding helps to highlight the purity of ingredients while also making the labels highly legible, actually encouraging consumers to know what's in a pill or gelcap, and perhaps just as importantly, what's not.
