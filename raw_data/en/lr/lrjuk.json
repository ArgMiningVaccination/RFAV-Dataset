Each session is unique, but many people claim to have had extraordinary experiences. The Crystal Beds are usually relaxing and comfortable. Crystal Beds are safe, non-invasive, and have no contraindications. Crystal Bed sessions are compatible with all complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, osteopathy, Reiki, Naturopathy, homeopathy, kinesiology, as well as any form of allopathic medicine. However, please note that this is not a medical treatment and should not replace any medications or treatments prescribed by a medical doctor. Our Crystal Bed healing room sessions are by appointment while observing all of the extra sanitizing and social distancing guidelines established for safety during this current health crisis. Sessions are held in our Healing Room, located in the Yurt\u2014round building. Pricing: $25 for 20-minutes, $50 for 40 minutes, or $75 for 60 minutes. If you miss your appointment, there are NO refunds for any reason. However, you can reschedule (if you call with more than 24 hours notice). Book your appointment now by calling our office at 928-282-7181. Our facilitator will have your room properly cleaned and set up for you when you arrive for your session. Payment is due when scheduling an appointment. The Crystal Bed has seven extremely clear, highly-polished quartz crystals that are suspended approximately 12 inches above you as you lie face-up on a massage table. Each crystal is aligned above one of the seven major chakras and has been cut to transmit a specific frequency. Colored lights, chosen to match the chakra healing colors, radiate light and energy through the crystals to each respective chakra. The lights shine on and off in certain rhythms, helping to cleanse, balance, energize, and align your energy\u2014thus restoring balance to the physical and etheric bodies. As these subtle energies are brought into balance, the body's own natural healing mechanisms are better able to function as they were designed to do. Crystal Bed sessions can help cleanse, balance, open, and recharge the body's energy, creating deep relaxation. You will lie face-up on a massage table and be made comfortable with pillows, a soft eye cover, and (if you prefer) a blanket. Seven clear quartz crystals suspended above your body will emit healing color, light, and crystal frequencies that can positively influence the body, its tissues, cells, organs, skin, mind, and spirit to stimulate a uniquely deep experience. You will not be touched or massaged during your session. Soft music is usually played and essential oils may be used to enhance your session. Many people feel refreshed, relaxed, and/or energized after a session, but others find themselves in an altered state (e.g. light-headed or spacy). Some have no overt experience at all. But you will have a few minutes after your session to integrate and return fully to your body. You are responsible for your after-session care and safety, so be sure to let your facilitator know what you need (e.g. water, time to get grounded, assistance walking, etc.). And if you feel you cannot safely drive or otherwise get yourself home, ask a friend to pick you up or plan to stay on-site until you feel fully grounded and ready. When you get home, do your best to rest or take it easy for several hours (if possible) to fully absorb the experience. And most people find it wise to drink plenty of water during the rest period, as water is thought to help flush the body of toxins or waste products released during any form of a healing session. It also can be helpful to journal about your sensations and experiences, or about any guidance you may have received from the session. There is nothing special you need to do. However, for the best results, wear white (or light-colored) clothing (if possible\u2014but not mandatory), and maintain an attitude of openness and receptivity, with a clear mind. Then, set an intention or prayer of what you want healed, released, or assisted with. The number of sessions you have depends on you. If you feel your need is serious, then two to three sessions per week might be helpful; you can then reduce the frequency to once per week, and then to once per month. If you are having Crystal Bed healing for a spiritual reason, then just once per week might feel adequate. Some people prefer to come whenever they feel intuitively called to do so. And still others choose a sessions once per month as a \"tune-up.\" The Global Center for Christ Consciousness (formerly Unity of Sedona) is pleased to provide many ways for people to be a part of the continual development of our Spiritual Center. 100 Northview Road Sedona, AZ 86336 Phone: [ (928) 282-7181](tel:(928)282-7181) The Global Center for Christ Consciousness is a spiritual center for students and masters on the spiritual path.
