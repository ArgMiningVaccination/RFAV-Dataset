The good news is that it's easy and fun to make a quality product on your own using the miracle of nature - essential oils. When I started working with skincare formulas in 2003, one of the first products I was excited about making was an essential oil-based facial serum. My skin needs were changing, and a moisturizing oil made perfect sense for dry, maturing skin. I decided to work with four wonderful healthy aging essential oils I had discovered: Lavender, Frankincense, Rose Geranium, and Carrot Seed. The natural and highly effective nature of essential oils makes them perfect for skincare. When blended for their various properties and used with a carrier oil that matches your skin type, you can create a serum tailor-made for your skin. Essential oils are the essence of plants. Hidden away in many parts of the plant, like the flowers, seeds, and roots, they are very potent chemical compounds. They can give the plant its scent, protect it from harsh conditions, and help with pollination. The benefits of essential oils on humans are diverse and amazing. Lavender flower oil, for example, contains compounds that help soothe skin irritation and redness, while the scent reduces feelings of anxiety and stress. The beautiful Rose essential oil is hydrating to the skin and sometimes used to treat scarring, while the scent is known to help lift depression. There are many essential oils to choose from for specific skincare needs. I have used a myriad of different combinations but keep coming back to the tried and true blend from my very first serum. The four essential oils used are the workhorses of skincare for mature skin, as well as being wonderfully uplifting for mind, body, and spirit. Here's what you'll need: 1 oz. [amber dropper bottle](https://amzn.to/37Vc8JE). You can find those in pharmacies or online. As a base, you can use one of the oils below or a combination of several that meet your skin's needs: Let's start with a simple recipe: Place the essential oil drops in the amber dropper bottle then fill with Jojoba/carrier oil. It's that simple! Use this serum morning and evening as part of your regular skincare routine. Serums work best when applied after cleansing your face. You can [cleanse with Coconut Oil](http://blog.dancingdingo.com/2015/10/take-new-look-at-coconut-oil.html) or a mixture of oils for enhanced hydration or use your regular facial cleanser. Essential oils will not interfere in any way with your normal skincare products. Keep in mind that the serum is concentrated. Use only a pea-sized amount, work it into your fingertips, and apply evenly over the face without tugging or pulling. If your skin feels tacky, reduce the amount on the next application. Your skin should feel soft, not oily. Follow with your regular moisturizer if you like. Making your own facial serum is fun and rewarding!
