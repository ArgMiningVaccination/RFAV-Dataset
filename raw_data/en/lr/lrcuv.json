Aligning with New York State Prevention Agenda and New York City public health priorities, the Community Service Plan focuses on Preventing Chronic Disease s by reduci ng risk factors for obesity and reducing tobacco use , and on Promoting Healthy Women, Infants and Children through parenting , early childhood , and teen pregnancy prevention programs . Through its Community Service Plan, NYUHC brings to bear a wide range of expertise: in obesity prevention, health literacy, parenting, family and community engagement, smoking cessation, prevention science, and population health. The programs and priorities remain consistent with both NYUHC's an d the former Lutheran Medical Center's prior years' Community Service Plans, but under the 2017 -2019 Plan, existing programs have been extended and new ones added, and its geographic scope now spans th e Lower East Side/Chinatown and Sunset Park . Although these communities are not geographically contiguous, they share important similarities, including the diversity of their populations (large Chinese American and Hispanic communities) and pockets of poverty amidst gentrification . The 2017 -2019 Community Service Plan is designed to create inter -disciplinary and inter- institutional synergies across programs , and to build on the strength of our community partnerships. The programs span multiple sectors: Community -based early childhood education settings and schools ParentCorps, an evidence -based family -centered early childhood intervention to improve child health, behavior and learning, is being implemented in collaboration with University Settlement Society of New York and with the Earth School, a public elementary school in Manhattan Community District 3 ( CD 3 ), and will expand to other public schools, including a school in the NYU Lutheran service area . State Prevention A genda Priority: Prevent Chronic Disease s; Promot e Healthy Women, Infants and Children NYU Hospitals Center (\"NYUHC\" or the \"Hospitals Center\") is a tertiary care teaching hospital with campuses located in Manhattan and Brooklyn and is the principal teaching hospital of New York University School of Medicine (\"NYUSM\"). Following the January 1, 2016 merger of NYU Lutheran Medical Center into NYUHC, NYUHC's operations now include three inpatient facilities and over t hirty off- campus hospital extension clinics in Manhattan and Brooklyn. In addition, the Sunset Park Health Council, Inc., a federally qualified health center network , is an NYUHC affiliate, operating nine primary care sites in Brooklyn and over forty schoo l- and shelter -based extension clinics under the name of NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers. NYUHC and NYUSM operate as an integrated academic medical center known as NYU Langone Medical Center. 1 Primary care Healthy Families Program /Programa de Familias Saludables , an intervention to address obesity for pre -adolescent children using a shared medical appointment model with one-on- one medical evaluation and group education and activities for the entire family , will be expanded and implemented in four NYU Lutheran Family Health Center s sites. State Prevention Agenda Priority: Prevent Chronic Disease s Greenlight, a program to improve health literacy and foster healthful behavior, is being adapted and implemented in partnership with the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center to lower rates of childhood obesity in the Chinese American community and will be extended to the NYU Lutheran Family Health Center s Brook lyn-Chinese site in Sunset Park. State Prevention Agenda Priority: Prevent Chronic Disease s Two Generations, a new program that seeks to reduce the negative health impact of perinatal depression and adverse childhood events on maternal and child physical and mental health , is being piloted in CD 3 in partnership with Gouverneur Health and in Sunset Park with NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers. State Prevention Agenda Priority: Promo te Healthy Wom en, Infants and Children Housing The Health +Housing Project , a Community Health Worker program to address social, environmental, behavioral, and structural determinants of health , is being implemented initially in two low -income buildings in CD 3 in partnership with Henry Street Settlement, the NYU Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy, the New York City Housing Authority, the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development, Hester Street Collaborative, the Chinatown Y MCA , the Two Bridges Neighborhood Council, and with additional support from the Robin Hood Foundation. State Prevention Agenda Priority: Prevent Chronic Disease s Community Tobacco Free Community, a community navigator program to facilitate access to smoking cessation treatment and reduce children's exposure to secondhand smoke, is being adapted and implemented in CD 3 in partnership with Asian Americans for Equality and will expand to serve residents of Sunset Park. State Prevention Agenda Priority: Prevent Chronic Disease s Project SAFE, a peer education program employing an evidence -based youth development approach to prevent teen pregnancy and HIV/AIDS, is being expanded in Sunset Park and other Brooklyn communities. State Prevention Agenda Priority: Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children REACH FAR, a program designed to prevent cardiovascular disease by increasing access to healthy foods and providing culturally tailored health coaching, is being launched initially in two mosque s in CD 3 and then will be expanded to two mosques in Sunset Park. State Prevention Agenda Priority: Preven t Chronic Disease s 2 Community H ealth N eeds A ssessment I. Hospitals C enter 's Mission St atement NYU Langone Me dical C enter , a world -class, p atient -centered, integrated ac ademic medical center, is one of the n ation's premier centers f or excellence in c linical care, b iomedical research, and medical education. Located i n the City of New York, NYU Langone i s composed of five hospitals - Tisch Hospital, its acute care i npatient facility; Rusk Institute for Rehabilitation Medicine, the world's first university-a ffiliated facility devoted entirely to patient rehabilitation; the Hospital for Joint Diseases, an inpatient hospital dedicated to orthopaedics and rheumatology; NYU Lutheran Medical Center , a full -service, 450-b ed teaching and community hospital located in Brooklyn; and Hassenfeld Children's Hospital, a comprehensive pediatric hospital supporting a full array of chi ldren's health services across the Medical Center. These hospitals operate as a singled licensed hospital facility: N YU Hospitals Center. An integral component of N YU Langone is th e NYU S chool o f Medicine , which s ince 1 841 h as trained thousands of p hysicians a nd scientists w ho h ave h elped t o shape the c ourse o f medical history, and t he Laura a nd Isaac P erlmutter Cancer Center , a National Cancer Institute - designated cancer c enter. Th e Medical C enter's tr ifold mission t o serve, teach, an d discover is ac hieved 365 days a year t hrough the seamless i ntegration of a culture devoted t o excellence in p atient care, education, a nd research. For information ab out the NYUHC financial assistance p rogram g o -oriented research and front -line partnerships, the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone Medical Center is bridging the worlds of medical care and public health to improve peoples' lives and the health of populations in New York City and around the globe. As part of carrying out this mission, the Department helped shape NYUHC's 2013 -2016 Community Health Needs Assessme nt (CHNA) and has overseen the implementation of the Community Service Plan (CSP) . NYU Lutheran's 2013- 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment was conducted by NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers (NYU LFHC) . With roots stretching back to 1967, NYU LFHC remains dedicated to its core principle: the innovative delivery of quality, culturally competent health care and human services to underserved people in diverse Brooklyn communities. Now, joined together , we have undertaken the 2017- 2019 Community Healt h Needs Assessment and developed the Community Service Plan. The new CSP is designed to create synergies across programs and to take advantage of the combined expertise of our larger institution, the strong foundation of work under both of our previous Plans, and the strength s of our community partnerships. With the recent merger of NYU Langone and NYU Lutheran, the expanded healthcare delivery system will provide better care to more New Yorkers in more locations than ever before. N YU Lutheran's Mission: NYU Lutheran exists to serve its neighbors. Luthera n serves a rich diversity of people through an entire continuum of community -based health and education services. NYU Lutheran is dedicated to caring for whole persons throughout whole communities. As a stabilizing foundation for these communities, Lutheran is committed to meeting our neighbors' changing physical, emotional, spiritual, intellectual and social needs. 3 Through the Community Health Needs Assessment and partnerships embedded in the Community Service Plan, we aim to create a platform for evidence -based health promotion and disease prevention at the nei ghborhood level with a focus on issues of high priority to the public's health. II. Definition and Brief Description of Communit ies Served As a major academic medical center, NYUHC serves a broad community of diverse populations with a wide range of health care needs. Its primary service area includes 45 zip codes in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens; its secondary service area extends into Stat en Island, Long Island, Westchester, and New Jersey. NYUHC's 2015 discharge data depicts a broad geographic area from which the hospitals draw patients . To understand the needs of our primary service areas, we reviewed all of the Community Health Profiles for New York City provided by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, as well as other health and demographic data (see Appendix A ). Based on that review, the 2017- 2019 Community Service Plan focuses on the communities served through NYU Langone and NYU Lutheran's previous Plans: the Lower East Side and Chinatown in Manha ttan, and Sunset Park in Brooklyn. In addition, in Year 1 of the Plan we will assess health priorities and needs in Red Hook, Brooklyn - an under -resourced and medically underserved community . These communities were selected based on the need for service as evidenced by social determinants, health disparities, risk factors, and utilization data. The Lower East Side and Chinatown To increase our impact and create opportunities for synergy across programs, starting with the 2013- 2016 CHNA, NYUHC focused on the closest area of greatest need: the Lower East Side and Chinatown (Manhattan CD 3) , a community with concentrated pockets of poverty and a high percentage of Latinos and Asians - groups that experience disparities in many health outcomes. Secondary data analysis : Although lower Manhattan as a whole has relatively low (18%) poverty rates, 28% of residents in the Lower East Side/Chinatown live below the Federal Poverty Level. Forty - seven percent of the residents of the Lower East Side/Chinatown receive income support. Within CD 3, there are areas of 4 concentrated poverty and d isparities in income are stark, with 29% of residents making less than $19,000 annually, and approximately 18% having incomes of $110,000 o r more. Nearly 27% of all public housing units in Manhattan are located in Community District 3 (about 8% of the total for NYC) , yet the community continues to gentrify, making it increasingly unaffordable to low -income residents. A historic stop for immigrants in the 19 th and early 20th centuries, immigrants still comprise 3 6% of CD 3's population. Of the 163,000 residents in Manhattan CD 3 , 33% are Asian and 25% are Latino. Census t racts in which Latinos and Asians live are more likely to be poor and to have residents with limited English proficiency . Overall, 37% of the population in CD 3 have limited English proficien cy. Among the Chinese language speakers, 77% speak English \"less than very well\" compared with 60% for Chinese language speaker s in Manhattan as a whole. In its most recent Need Statement, the Community Board has highlighted this issue, particularly for seniors (who comprise almost 15% of the population). 5 To understand more about community need and to help policymakers, providers and community groups access data, target resources, tailor interventions and evaluate impact, with additional support from the NY Community Trust, we are developing an iAtlas - a sect or bridging map that will use a wide array of secondary data to illuminate variations in health determinants and health outcomes, starting in Manhattan CD 3 and then expanding to Sunset Park and eventually develop ing into a citywide resource. A list of data sources accessed is set forth in Appendix A . Primary data collection and analysis : In conjunction with our development of the iAtlas , we held three focus groups with a total of 20 community leaders . Participants noted that because of the diversity of CD 3, Community District level data mask large pockets of vulnerability associated with poverty and with racial and ethnic disparities in health. The focus group participants identified a wide range of health concerns including smoking; mental health and addiction; and access to healthy, affordable food. More broadly, there was a strong consensus in all three groups that health was affected by the stress of poverty; the challenges of finding stable, affordable and well- maintain ed housing; language barriers; and issues with the built environment (food access, places for physical activity, traffic safety). Seniors, immigrants, people with mental illness and low -income children were identified as particularly vulnerable population s. As part of our Health+Housing Project , a Community Health Worker program described below, we held community workshops in two low -income buildings on the Lower East Side. Simultaneous Spanish and Cantonese translation was provided for the 45 adult residents who attended. Participants were asked about factors that affect people's health and then to map health determinants in the neighborhood. Issues identified include: social isolation for non -English speakers; prevention and management of obesity and cardiovascular disease, 6 including education about and access to healthy, affordable food; management of dementia and access to mental health services; exposure to second hand smoke; asthma ; traffic safety; and pest control (inside and outside of build ings). As part of that needs assessment, we also surveyed the adult residents of those buildings. Our findings from the survey are summarized in the description of the Health+Housing Project below. Sunset Park NYU Lutheran initiated the development of its Community Service Plan by reviewing existing federal, State, City, and hospital data and comparing neighborhoods that comprise the NYU Lutheran Medical Center primary service area : the four contiguous neighborhoods of Sunset Park, Bay Ridge, Borough Park, and Bensonhurst. Based on our assessment of the social determinants of health and other risk factors, health disparities, and data on health care utilization, we have focused our efforts o n Sunset Park, including Northern Bay Ridge (zip codes 11220 and 11232). Secondary data analysis : Sunset Park is defined as zip codes 11220 and 11232 and is located in the geographic boundaries of Brooklyn Community District 7 in Southwest Brooklyn, New York. A mixed residential, industrial, and commercial area located on Brooklyn's waterfront, its population is 151,077 people. More than o ne-quarter of its residents (26%) are under the age of 20. For nearly 200 years, Sunset Park has served as a first destination for immigrants - today, 48% of residents are foreign born. Two crowded and vibrant commercial corridors of shops, restaurants, and small businesses serve the large Latino (42%) and Asian (32%) communities. With a network of community - and faith -based organizations and local industries that provide entry level service and factory jobs, t he neighborhood has supported and provided a foothold for many new immigrants . 7 Like Manhattan's CD 3, Sunset Park is a community that grapples with high levels of poverty, low education al attainment, and health disparities. Twenty -nine percent of residents live below the Federal Poverty level compared to 21 % of families in New York City as a whole . Poverty is particularly acute among families with children - 33% of families with children under 18 live below the poverty level. The median household income is $ 42,630. Levels of educational attainment fall below Brooklyn and New York City as a whole. Forty -one percent of residents lack a high school credential from the U.S. or their home country - 24% have less than a 9 th grade education . English language proficiency is a major barrier for Sunset Park residents : 75% of residents speak a primary language other than English at home . Forty -eight percent of residents have limited English proficiency. In addition, Sunset Park has the second oldest housing stock in New York City and residents often have no choice but to rent units in poor condition. One-third of residents live in severely rent -burdened households. Sunset Park ranks 3rd in the City for severe overcrowding (9%). Primary data collection and analysis: For the 2013 -2016 Community Service Plan, NYU Lutheran undertook a comprehensive community engagement effort to ensure that the needs assessment included authentic community voice. This framework informed the planning and development of the current CSP. In addition, in the fall of 2014, the New York Academy of Medicine conducted a Br ooklyn -wide community needs assessment (CNA) on behalf of NYU Lutheran and other hospital systems as part of New York 8 State's Medicaid Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) program . The data collected through that process have helped inform the Community Health Needs Assessment and the 2017 -2019 Community Service Plan. The CNA included a survey, interviews, and focus groups , reaching a wide range of residents and community leaders. Participants were recruited through community -based partne rs, as well as canvassing in targeted neighborhoods. The survey questions focused on individual and community -wide health concerns, health care utilization, barriers to care, and use of community and other services. Thirty -five community and issue area ex perts were interviewed and 24 focus groups were conducted. Given the high percentage of Sunset Park residents who are Latino or Chinese American , the CNA took a deeper look at health status , behaviors, and knowledge and barriers to care within those communities. Latino residents , like many other populations across the City, reported concerns about the prevalence of obesity (including among children), diabetes, and depression. Residents reported concerted efforts to eat a healthy diet and to engage in physical activity \u2014for themselves and for their children. However, lack of time, budget constraints, as well as ingrained habits, serve as barriers to healthy choices. Lack of insurance was more common in the Latino community than among other groups, a nd resulted in high out -of-pocket costs, lower use of primary care and preventive services, and use of emergency care for non -urgent problems . The CNA found that smoking is a major concern, with higher rates in the Chinese American community, resulting i n high rates of asthma, lung cancer, and other respiratory problems. Cultural beliefs - including stigma and preference for traditional Chinese medicine - and lack of knowledge about preventive services and access to health information affected utilization of health care services within the Chinese American community, particularly among older adults and recent immigrants. Prior needs assessments have consistently identified access to affordable, quality early childcare as an ongoing need for th e Sunset Park community. In response, in 2013, NYU Lutheran established the Parent -Child Home Program, an evidence -based early literacy program for isolated and high -risk families. For the current CHNA , we collaborat ed with an NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public Service Capstone Team to conduct an in-depth needs assessment , which included a research review; a parent survey in English, Spanish, and Chinese administered at two Sunset Park locations; and six expert interviews. The assessment highlighted potential partnerships that would facilitate the expansion of early childhood services . To assure that the views of community youth were reflected in the Community Service Plan , teen peer educators in collaboration with youth service staff , developed a Teen Sexual Healthcare Access S urvey , which was administered though street outreach to 275 youth ages 13-19 to learn more about perceived barriers to accessing sexual health services. The survey asked respondents about their personal access to sexual health services and their thoughts on 9 what makes a teen health clinic appealing and accessible to young people . Data from the surveys indicated a need for effective outreach: 60% of respon dents could not identify a sexual health clinic in their neighborhood that they felt safe visiting , and 49% had never visited a clinic for sexual health services . A list of data sources accessed is set forth in Appendix A . Red Hook In Year 1 of the 2017 -2019 Community Service Plan, we will conduct a C ommunity Health Needs Assessment and collaboratively develop a plan to prioritize and address pressing health concerns and issues in Red Hook, Brooklyn. This assessment is particularly important because readily available data for Red Hook - such as the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Community District Profile - includes more affluent neighboring communities , thereby masking pockets of poverty and need. We anticipate presenting a community overview in the 2017 CSP progress report. III. Public Participation Public participation in assessing community need and setting priorities has been a continuous process over the past three years. We have engaged a range of stakeholders - with a particular focus on medically underserved residents - to assess community needs; set priorities; develop, design, and implement programs; and share and celebrate progress and result s. We employ diverse, oft en multi -pronged, strategies and rely on our extensive network of community partners and advisory boards and committees to provide ongoing outreach and program development. NYU Lutheran's advisory structure includes the Sunset Park Health Council as the community governing board; culturally -specific advisory groups; and program -specific councils, including the Teen Health Council. The NYUHC CSP Coordinating Council, describe d below, meets quarterly with a large group community organizations , local leaders, policymakers , and partners. In addition, o ver the past year , we have consulted on multiple occasions with numerous public health experts in the City and State Health Departments , the City and State Office of Mental Health, the City Department of Education, and other agencies and organizations with expertise on the needs of low -income populations and children , including community leaders , resident associations, community -based organizations , advocacy groups, and members of Community Board s. A list of people and organizations consulted is attached as Appendix B . We have solicited written comments from the public on our previous CHNA and implementation plans both through our website and at public meetings. Although no written comments were received, comments and discussion followed public presentation s at community meetings. Public notification about the assessment and plan development and implementation was provided through meeting s with the Human S ervices, Health, Disability, & S eniors/Youth & Education Committee of Manhattan Community Board 3 and with the Health, Seniors & Disabilities Subcommittee of Manhattan Community Board 6 , which covers the area in which Tisch Hospital , the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, and the Hospital for Joint Diseases are located . NYU Lutheran obtained input and notified the public through the advisory structure 10 describe d above, as well as through Brooklyn Community Board 7 and our extensive network of community partners. Through these mee tings and interviews, as well as through an extensive review of secondary sources of data ( see Appendix A), we have compiled and updated our profile of the health needs and strengths of the Lower East Side/Chinatown and Sunset Park . This analysis has, in turn, informed the priorities and partnerships that comprise our Community Service Plan. IV. A ssessment and Selection of Public Health Priorities Aligning with the New York State Prevention Agenda and New York City public health priorities, the Co mmunity Service Plan focuses on Preventing Chronic Diseases by reducing risk factors for obesity and reducing tobacco use, and on Promoting Healthy Women, Infants and Children through parenting, early childhood and teen pregnancy prevention programs . As described below, these are key c oncerns in our communities and the evidence -based programs we are adapting and implementing to address these issues allow us to bring to bear the substantial scientific and clinical expertise of NYUHC and NYU LFHC in obesity prevention, health literacy, parenting, family engagement, smoking cessation, prevention science, implementation science, community -based participatory research, and population health. A. Priority Area: P reventing Chronic D isease Preventing and addressing obesity Although recent New York City FitnessGram data (provided by the NYC Department of Education and used with permission from NYU's Institute for Education and Social Policy ) show an encouraging decrease in the prevalence of obesity among elementary school children in NYC, obesity continues to be epidemic: more than half of adult New Yorkers are overweight (34%) or obese (22%). Obesity begins early in life. Two out of every five NYC elementary school ch ildren are overweight or obese, putting these children at immediate risk for hyp ertension, elevated lipid levels and diabetes - referred to as \"adult onset\" prior to the obesity epidemic. These r isks escalate as obese children become adults , when they als o become a t risk for heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and cancer. Disadvantaged urban communities are disproportionately affected by obesity, in part due to lack of neighborhood resources, such as the availab ility of health y food and safe places for physical activity . In New York City, as in the rest of the country, there are clear income and racial disparities with regard to obesity . The lowest- income New Yorkers have a rate of obesity 45% higher than that of the highest earners. Adult Latino and African American New Yorkers are more than 1.5 times more likely to be obese than Whites. Latino residents of Brooklyn have the highest rate of obesity in the borough (36.3 %). Obesity rates among NYC's children also vary dramatically. For example, as o f 2013, the obesity rate among Latino children in the City's public schools is 71% higher than that of White children. An estimated 19% of Sunset Park children between the ages of 5 and 14 are obese. In 2014, NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers Women and Children Health Center served 935 children aged 10 -11 years with a BMI > 95th percentile, 190 (20%) of whom were Hispanic. 11 Although the rates of overweight and obesity are lower among most Asian American group s, given emerging evidence that Asian populations are more vulnerable to insulin resistance at lower weights , preventing obesity is a high priority . A study by researchers at the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center found that 24.6% of the children in the pediatric practice (drawn largely from the Chinatown area) were overweight or obese. Among U.S. born boys ages 6-12, the combined prevalence of o verweight and obesity was 40%. Although the prevalence of obesity in CD 3 (14%) and Sunset Park (19%) is lower than the City overall (25% ), low -income children in both communities remain vulnerable , and preventing obesity is a concern among community re sidents and leaders. Obesity and the need for physical activity were ranked among the top five health priorities by participants in the Chinatown Community Consultation held in December 2015 by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). Similarly, Sunset Park residents ranked obesity and the consumption of sugary drinks among the top five concerns in the Sunset Park DOHMH Community Consultation in December 2015. Sunset Park residents report among the lowest levels of physical activity in New York City (81.2% of adults report not engaging in any sports or recreational activities that raised their breathing rate in the past 7 days, and 33% report not getting any physical activity other than what is required for work in the past 30 days). For Sunset Park and the Lower East Side/Chinatown, obesity prevention beginning in early childhood is important as a way to affect the health trajectory typically seen for immigrants, where each subsequent generation is at increased risk of obesity and the development of diabetes. There is substantial evidence that the roots of obesity are established in early childhood and that effe ctive obesity prevention efforts need to target families and children early in life. Children who are already overweight by ages 3 to 7 are at much greater risk of becoming overweight adults. Moreover , young children are able to self- regulate eating in response to feelings of hunger and fullness, but by age 5, they become increasingly influenced by negative environmental factors. Finally , health behaviors ( such as eating habits and physical activity patterns) that contribute to obesity become established in early childhood and hard to change thereafter. These developmental patterns make early childhood a critical time for obesity prevention. The pre -teen years are also a critical moment for stabilizing and reducing obese children's weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) scores. This period marks a time when children are beginning to develop better abstract reasoning ability, are better able to consider the consequences of their actions, have more control over what they eat and how they spend their time, and begin making their own decisions. Overweight adolescents with metabolic syndrome have a sevenfold greater risk for developing diabetes and twice the risk for developing NYC DOHMH Take Care New York 2020 Community Meetings Top Five Health Concerns LOWER EAST SIDE/ CHINATOWN SUNSET PARK Obesity Obesity Smoking Smoking Physical Activity Sugary Drinks High Blood Pressure High School Graduation Air Quality Unmet Medical Need 12 cardiovascular dise ase. The cluster of metabolic syndrome risk factors is generally silent and remains undetected until medical testing or presentation of overt disease. Adolescents are low users of preventive health care services and are unlikely to come to medical attent ion until symptomatic, by which time their health problems are more difficult to reverse. Multidisciplinary programs that include nutrition education, behavior modification, and promotion of physical activity have been shown to be the most effective in ad dressing the needs of children who are already struggling with overweight or obesity. Parents play a critical role in the prevention of obesity among children. However, there are substantial challenges to engaging low-income families, who are often at greatest risk, in obesity prevention efforts - including difficulties in reaching out to populations that may have low levels of education and health literacy, who may face competing priorities and other stressors, or who may not have access to healthy foo ds and safe play spaces . Research also highlights the importance of alignment with the local context and family's cultural beliefs and practices to increase family engagement and increase initiation of healthy behaviors in the home. Successful efforts to engage parents and other key family members in obesity prevention need to address these challenges. Reducing t obacco use Reducing tobacco use is a key public health priority for New York City and New York State. Despite the existence of effective tobacco dependence treatments, cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S., responsible for over 4 00,000 premature deaths annually and 8.6 million people living with a seriou s smoking -related illness, including many forms of cancer, heart disease, stroke, and lung diseases. According to the National Cancer Institute, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women in the United States, and approxim ately 90% of lung cancer deaths among men and 80% among women are due to smoking. Smoking also causes many other types of cancer, including cancers of the throat, mouth, nasal cavity, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, kidney, bladder, and cervix, and acute myeloid leukemia. In New York State , 25,500 people die each year from a smoking -related disease and 3 ,040 non - smokers die each year from exposure to others' smoking. Annual smoking -related health care costs and lost productivity in New York total $14.2 b illion and the annual health care expenditure in the State directly caused by tobacco use amounts to $8.17 billion. The economic burden extends to smokers , who are now paying over $11 per pack. Given that the smoking prevalence is highest among those wit h the lowest incomes, there is an even more compelling reason to implement strategies to ensure that smoking cessation resources reach this population. In response to the heavy toll of tobacco use, New York State and New York City have implemented aggressive tobacco control agendas. Included i n this comprehensive package of policies and programs are efforts to increase access to evidence -based treatment for smokers and a n emphasis on developing strategies to reduce the toll of secondhand smoke expo sure, particularly among children. A recent study underscores the urgent need to address smoking in housing in New York City . Even a mong children who did not live with someone who smoked in the home, cotinine levels ( a measure of exposure to secondhand s moke ) of children living in 13 apartments were 45% higher than among those living in detached houses. Living in multi -unit housing is placing many children at risk of secondhand smoke related health consequences. New York City has achieved remarkable reduc tions in smoking prevalence, from 21.5% in 2002 to 13.9% in 2014. But the rates of reduction across populations have been uneven and income - related and racial and ethnic disparities persist. Despite the high cost of cigarettes, the smoking prevalence among low -income New Yorkers is 16%. Of particular concern is the smoking rate among Asian men in NYC (21.3%), which, by contrast with other populations, is higher now than it was in 2002. Asian smokers are more likely to be heavy smo kers than other racial and ethnic groups. Asian men have the highest rates of heavy daily smoking in New York City (6.6% compared to 2.7% overall). Not surprisingly, although the data vary from year- to-year, overall, the rates of smoking in the Lower East Side/ Chinatown and Sunset Park , communities with large and relatively poor Asian population s, remain higher than in much of the rest of the City. In addition, Asian American non -smokers are less likely to prohibit smoking in the home than are other non-smokers. Thus, the rates of exposure to secondhand smoke among many families and children living in these communities are likely to be dangerously h igh. At recent Community Consultations sponsored by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, smoking ranked among the top five health concerns among community residents in both the Lower East Side/Chinatown and Sunset Park.

Of great concern, New York's key population indicators of maternal and child health have been stagnant or worsened during the last decade. Even for measures wit h improving trends, there are striking racial, ethnic and economic disparities. \" Similarly, the NYC DOHMH Take Care New York 2020 highlights the need to reduce rates of teen pregnancy, noting the higher rate among low -income Smoking rates - NYC, 2002 - 2014 Source: New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Community Health Survey 2002 -20014. Available at: https://a816 - healthpsi.nyc.gov/epiquery/ 14 populations . Sunset Park has the twelfth highest birth rate among the 59 community districts in the City, with 33.2 births per 1000 girls ages 15 -19 - over 40% higher than the City as a whole. Of particular concern for low-income populations is maternal/child exposure to adversity , which is increasingly recognized as a major public health issue . In New York State, 18% of children experience two or more adverse childhood events (ACE), defined as traumatic experiences occurring before the age of 18, such as poverty, parenta l mental illness, parental substance abuse, neglect or abuse, exposure to domestic violence, and other traumas . Poverty, which is the most common and pervasive ACE, disproportionately affects immigrant families, which comprise a large part of the Lower Ea st Side/Chinatown and Sunset Park communities. Maternal stressors during the prenatal period increase the risk of pre - and postnatal depression, the likelihood of pregnancy complications and adverse birth outcomes, and decreased responsiveness in the new born, lower initiation of breastfeedin g, over feeding, and increased emergency d epartment visits. Fetal exposure to maternal stress in pregnancy negatively affects a child's neuro -development and increases the likelihood of poor health outcomes, such as delays in communication, soci al-emotional competence, cognitive functioning, behavioral problems, and chronic conditions. These adverse early influences in turn set the stage for subsequent impaired scholastic achievement, conduct disorder, criminal justi ce system involvement, and a trajectory of disadvantage. In both Lower East Side /Chinatown and Sunset Park, the impact on families of the stress of poverty and poor quality or unstable housing - particularly amidst gentrification - is of grave concern in the community . Community residents and members of the Community Board s have highlighted the need to prevent and address mental health issues early. C. Community needs not addressed and why Across New York City and within our selected neighborhoods , there are, of course, many health needs that are beyond the scope of this plan. Indeed, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Take Care New York 2020 identifies twenty -three key indicators under four overarching themes . Selecting priority areas for NYUHC's Community Service Plan and using resources efficiently and effectively necessarily means concentrating on some specific challenges and affording less attention to others. For example, in meetings with members of Manhattan Community Board 3 and in the Community Board's District Needs Statement 2017 , the need for senior services, programs to prevent heavy and binge drinking, services for the growing LGBTQ population, and for culturally and linguistically competent mental heal th services, were all identified as pressing concerns . Similarly, in Sunset Park , asthma prevention and management , and adult weight management interventions have been identified as important needs and priorities . While some of these needs are being met by other NYUHC and NYU LFHC programs , others are being addressed by the many valuable community organizations and health care providers in the community. Over the duration of the CSP, we will coordinate our efforts with community organizations so that we continue to have a comprehensive and up -to-date understanding of community needs 15 and resources so that we can maximize our collective impact to improve the community's health . D. Information gaps that limit NYUHC's ability to assess the community's health needs As noted above, although the New York City DOHMH provides a wide array of data about the health of the City and its neighborhoods, the diversity of the Lower East Side/Chinatown and Sunset Park - econ omicall y and in terms of race and ethnicity - necessitates a more granular, on-the-ground approach to understanding community needs and assets. Our engagement with community partners and meetings with community residents and organizations have greatly enhanced our understanding of the community's needs and priorities . As described below, t his process will continue throughout the next three years of the Community Service Plan . In addition, our iAtlas , which will use secondary data to illuminate variations in health determinants and health outcomes , will help fill some of the gaps in our understanding of health status and need in these neighborhoods. E. Existing facilities and resources To develop an inventory of existing facilities and resources, we reviewed listings of Selected Facilities and Program Sites prepared by the NYC Department of City Planning as part of the Community District Profile for Manhattan CD 3 and Brooklyn CD 7. The NYC Department of City Planning NYC CityMap portal ( http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/community/community - portal.page ) was used to visually catalog assets and resources - such a s schools, day care centers, senior centers, and libraries. For program -specific needs, we have also relied on information provided on the Greater New York Hospital Association Health Information for Empowerment website ( http://www.hitesite.org/Default.aspx ), which provides information about free and low - cost health and social services by zip code. These sources are a useful guide and checklist. In addition, we continually deepen our understanding of community assets through interviews and meetings with community leaders and from ongoing partnerships , some of which span decades . These relationships give us a deep understanding of the history and resources of the communities. The Lower East Side and Chinatown, home to waves of immigrant s over several generations, have many strong and enduring community organizations that provide a wide array of services, including education, housing, health and wellness, and advocacy . Some of these organization s, including University Settlement Society and Henry Street Settlement, grew out of the social reform movements of the 1800s . Others, including Asian Americans for Equality and the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center , began as grassroots groups of volun teers in the mid -1970s and have since grown into treasured multiservice agencies. CD 3 also has many valued health care providers, including the William F. Ryan -NENA Community Health Center, the Betances Health Center, and Gouverneur Health , among others. Many smaller grassroots groups continue to serve th is neighborhood and will continue to be invaluable partners in our prevention initiatives. The Community Board is active and engaged in a wide range of health and wellness issues. W e have met with many organizations and individuals as part of the 16 Community Health Needs Assessment and we will continue this outreach over the course of the Plan. NYU Lutheran has a long history of strong collaborative relationships with community partners to create integrated service delivery systems that empower individuals and families and provide them with the skills they need to improve their health and effect change within the community. Many of these organizations, like NYU Lutheran , developed from faith -based organizations . The Center for Family Life and Goo d Shepherd Services are multi -service, child -welfare organizations with deep roots in southwest Brooklyn. Turning Point was established as a faith -based outreach ministry focused on substance abuse and now has evolved into a comprehensive multi- service organization focused on special populations, including youth and homeless New Yorkers. Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Cor poration works in partnership with the local Community Board to drive the economic empowerment of Sunset Park's waterfront industry . Workforce development providers such as Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow and Brookly n Workforce Innovations focus on bu ilding the work readiness and skills of local residents. NYU Lutheran plays a unique role in the community as both a major health care and human service s provider. The Department of Community Based Programs provides community engagement, family strengthening and educational programming to address social determinates of residents' health. Services include adult education , family literacy , youth development , workforce dev elopment, case management and supportive services , early childhood services, services for older adults , and community service opportunities. Community Service Plan/Implementation Strategy Building on the clinical and scientific expertise and capabilities of the Medical Center and NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers, NYUHC's three- year Community Service Plan takes a family - centered, multi -sector and holistic approach to improving health in Manhattan's Lower East Side and Chinatown ( Manhattan Com munity District 3), and the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn. New York State and City public health priorities: Aligning with New York State Prevention Agenda and New York City public health priorities, the Community Service Plan focuses on Prevent ing Chronic Disease s by reducing risk factors for obesity and reducing tobacco use , and on Promoting Healthy Women, Infants and Children through parenting and early childhood programs and teen pregnancy prevention. Addressing health disparities: Each of the programs we are implementing addresses a health disparity: the higher risk for obesity among Latino and other immigrant and low-income populations; high rates of smoking among Asian American men; high rates of teen pregnancy and risk for sexually transmitted disease among low -income youth; and increased risk of maternal depression and child development problems among families who experience the stresses of poverty. The programs and priorities of the 2017 -2019 CSP remain consistent with both NYUHC's and the former Lutheran Medical Center's prior years' Community Service Plans, but existing programs have been expanded and new ones added, and the geographic scope of the programs has been 17 expanded. Although the Lower East Side/Chinatown and Sunset Park are not geographically contiguous, they share important similarities, including the diversity of their populations (large Chinese American and Hispanic communities) and pockets of poverty amidst gentrification . Spannin g both neighborhoods, the 2017 -2019 Community Service Plan is designed to create inter -disciplinary and inter- institutional synergies, and to build on the strength of our community partnerships. Although the programs described below target specific risk factors that that align with City and State Health Department priorities, we also recognize the importance of understanding and addressing context : in the words of the State Prevention Agenda, \"the impact of social, economic, environmental, biological, behavioral and psychological factors on individuals and families throughout their lives.\" For this reason, all of the Community Service Plan programs take a holistic approach. For example, our programs that address obesity do so in the context of child and family mental health and self -efficacy ; our housing- based health initiative connects residents to a wide range of s ocial, medical and mental health service s; our smoking cessation program reaches smokers and their families by providing other community -based services; and our pregnancy prevention program focuses on educating and empowering teens . The programs span mult iple sectors: Community -based early childhood education settings and schools ParentCorps, an evidence -based family -centered early childhood intervention to improve child health, behavior and learning, is being implemented in collaboration with University Settlement Society of New York and with the Earth School, a public elementary school in Manhattan Community District 3 (CD 3 ), and will expand to other public schools, including a school in the NYU Lutheran service area. State Prevention Agenda Priority: Prevent Chronic Disease s; Promo te Healthy Women, Infants and Children Primary care Healthy Families Program /Programa de Familias Saludables , an intervention to address obesity for pre -adolescent children using a shared medical appointment model with one-on- one medical evaluation and group education and activities for the entire family , will be expanded and implemented in four NYU Lutheran Family Health Center s sites. State Prevention Agenda Priority: Prevent Chronic Disease s Greenlight, a program to improve health literacy and foster healthful behavior, is being adapted and implemented in partnership with the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center to lower rates of childhood obesity in the Chinese American community and will be 18 extended to the NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers Brooklyn -Chinese site in Sunset Park. State Prevention Agenda Priority: Prevent Chronic Disease s Two Generations, a new program that seeks to reduce the negative health impact of perinatal depression and adverse childhood events on maternal and child physical and mental health , is being piloted in CD 3 in partnership with Gouverneur Health and in Sunset Park with NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers. State Prevention Agenda Priority: Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children Housing The Health+Housing Project, a Community Health Worker program to address social, environmental, behavioral, and structural determinants of health , is being implemented initially in two low -income buildings in CD 3 in partnership with Henry Street Settlement, the NYU Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy, the New York City Housing Authority, the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development, Hester Street Collaborative, the Chinatown Y MCA , the Two Brid ges Neighborhood Council, and with additional support from the Robin Hood Foundation. State Prevention Agenda Priority: Prevent Chronic Disease s Community Tobacco Free Community, a community navigator program to facilitate access to smoking cessation treatment and reduce children's exposure to secondhand smoke, is being adapted and implemented in CD 3 in partnership with Asian Americans for Equality and will expand to serve residents of Sunset Park. State Prevention Agenda Priority: Prevent Chronic Disease s Project SAFE, a peer education program employing an evidence -based youth development approach to prevent teen pregnancy and HIV/AIDS, is being expanded in Sunset Park and other Brooklyn communities. State Prevention Agenda Priority: Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children REACH FAR, a program designed to prevent cardiovascular disease by increasing access to healthy foods and providing culturally tailored health coaching , is being launched initially in two mosque s in CD 3 and then will be expanded to two mosques in Sunset Park. State Prevention Agenda Priority: Preven t Chronic Disease s In the sections that follow, we briefly describe our programs , our progress to date , and our goals under the 2017 -2019 Plan . See Appendix C for a table that summarizes project components. 19 Our Programs Sector: community -based early childhood education settings and schools ParentCorps: Preventing Chronic Disease ; Promoting Healthy Women, Infants and Children ParentCorps is an evidence -based program developed by NYU Langone Medical Center's Center for Early Childhood Health and Development (CEHD), which is designed to buffer the adverse effects of poverty and related stressors on early child development by enga ging and supporting both parents and teachers at children's transition to school. A family -centered intervention, ParentCorps promotes foundational skills in pre -kindergarten and improves achievement test scores and behavioral and physical health in elem entary school. ParentCorps works by strengthening family engagement and helping parents and teachers provide high -quality environments. ParentCorps builds adults' capacity to use evidence - based practices to create safe, nurturing and predictable environm ents in which children thrive. ParentCorps: Promotes foundational skills for students as they make the critical transition to school. Engages diverse parents as partners and creates networks of knowledgeable, empowered and capable parents throughout the school community. Builds on the strengths of culturally -diverse students and families and includes tailored proactive strategies to address the needs of students with challenging behavior. Incorporates \"best practices\" from mental health, education and professional learning to provide supportive, safe and inspiring spaces for educators and parents to work together on their shared goal of helping young children to succeed. Supports sustaina ble changes in the early childhood workforce to strengthen program quality, ensure that P re-K and related services are culturally relevant, and promote racial equity and equal opportunities for every student to succeed. Two federally -funded, randomized controlled trials with more than 1,200 poor, minority NYC children have found that ParentCorps results in more supportive and nurturing home and early childhood classroom environments, higher kindergarten achievement scores (reading, writing, and math) and, among the highest -risk children, lower rates of obesity and mental health problems. A benefit -cost analysis 20 indicates that ParentCorps has the potential to yield cost savings of more than $2,500 per student . In sum, ParentCorps impact on school readiness, achievement, mental health and physical health suggests the potential to improve on current efforts to reduce the achievement gap and health disparities for NYC's children. Progress and Impact During the f irst three years of the Community Service Plan, CEHD partnered with University Settlement Society, a large social service agency with three early childhood sites (including one in CD3); and with the Earth School, an elementary school located on East 6 th Street (CD3). University Settlement Society In partnership with University Settlement Society, in the first two years of the Community Service Plan, ParentCorps provided p rofessional development to 56 University Settlement staff, including a four -day series called ParentCorps FUNdamentals. In addition, 21 teachers, teaching assistants and school aides received training and coaching on implementation of the ParentCorps Program for Students (\"Friends School\") in Pre -K classrooms and six social workers, family service workers and school aides received training and coaching on the ParentCorps Parenting Program. Building on this foundation, in 2014 -2015, all Pre -K classrooms implemented the Friends School curriculum, providing the 14-session intervention to 147 children. In addition, University Settlement mental health professionals and support staff implemented six 14 -session series of the Parenting Program reaching 116 families. The Parenting Program series was implemented in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese. Teachers and mental health professionals received weekly coaching by ParentCorps throughout the year to ensure high levels of fidelity. University Settlement Society University Settlement is one of New York's most dynamic social service institutions with deep roots on the Lower East Side. Each year University Settlement's diverse programs help over 30,000 low-income and at -risk people build better lives for themselves and their families. With an impressive legacy as the first settlement house in the United States, University Settlement has been an incubator for progressive ideas for over 1 25 years, offering pioneering programs in early childhood education, literacy, mental health, arts education, and adolescent development that set the standard. From its earliest days, University Settlement has invested in a robust range of early childhood services, including education, mental health care, early intervention, childcare and arts and recreation. Today, University Settlement's early childhood program s directly support nearly 1,600 New York City children each year. 21 Parents and caregivers were asked to complete brief questionnaires after each session. More than 90% reported that they felt welcomed and respected, supported and valued by program facilitators. Nearly all parents stated that they were able to und erstand the material presented and were ready to try the strategies at home. Importantly, the vast majority of parents indicated that they felt more confident in their ability to support their children's develop ment. The Earth School Beginning in 2013, mental health professionals and other staff from the Earth School (PS 364) received professional development so that they could offer the Parenting Program to families of Pre -K students. During the 2014 -15 school year, the Earth School s uccessfully implemented a 14-session cycle of the Parenting Program to 21 families. Leaders and staff from University Settlement and the Earth School are committed to providing evidence -based ParentCorps programs to the children and families served thro ughout their early education programs. By providing ParentCorps as an enhancement to high -quality early childhood education, children are much more likely to develop the foundational self -regulation and social- emotional skills necessary for school success and healthy development. Plans Over the next three years, ParentCorps will fully support high -quality implementation and continuous quality improvement within all three University Settlement sites (Lower East Side, Manhattan; East New York, Brooklyn ; and Park Slope, Brooklyn) and the Ea rth School (CD3). This includes providing ParentCorps Fundamentals, training, ParentCorps 101 and coaching to program staff who have not been previously exposed. In addition, we will bring ParentCorps to at least two new public schools with Pre -K program s in CD 3 and/or in the NYU Lutheran catchment area. In total, we expect to reach over 1200 children and 660 families. Here's what parents said about ParentCorps programs: \"Today's group was very enlightening and helpful. The support offered was amazing. The concerns expressed by other parents were similar to my concerns.\" \"As a grandparent, I was happy that I was able to be here for my daughter. Being a support system, I learn a lot from other parents.\" \"I was able to express my views on discipline and learn new strategies.\" \"I am confident that I can hear about some great parenting techniques to teach my child.\" \"From all the parents I learned that children have different responses to different st rategies. I will try to find one that fits mine.\" The Earth School In 1992, teachers in Manhattan's East Village founded the Earth School to create a peaceful, nurturing place to stimulate learning in all realms of child development intellectual, social, emotional and physical. Today it is a thriving community of over 300 children in pre -kindergarten through grade 5 with a teaching staff dedicated to the founding values of hands -on exploration, an arts -rich curriculum, responsible stewardship of the Earth's resources, harmonious resolution of conflict, and parent - teacher partnership. Earth School children come from diverse cultural, ethnic and economic backgrounds. Most classrooms combine two grades so that older students can thrive as guides and mentors while younger o nes gain confidence in being part of a caring community of learners. 22 Healthy Families/ Familias Saludables participants on a local supermarket trip. Nutritionist, Juan Batista (RD, CDN), is highlighting ways to achieve the principles of 5 -2-1-0 and portion size (using My Plate guides, as seen in one mother's hands) within the local and Hispanic cultural contexts. Sector: primary care Healthy Families Program/ Programa de Familias Saludables : Preventing Chronic Disease Stemming from the 2013 CHNA, the NYU LFHC Department of Community Based Programs convened a design team to develop a pediatric obesity program to address the high rates of obesit y among children in Sunset Park, supplement ing the care and referrals routinely provided by pediatric primary care providers . An estimated 19% of Sunset Park residents between the ages of 5 and 14 are obese , increasing their risk for diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer and asthma. Sunset Park also has a high concentration of children living in poverty and a large Hispanic population (42%), who are particularly vulnerable to obesity. The program design team - consisting of a medical doctor, nutritionists, community planners, and social workers - used the National Initiative for Children's Healthcare Quality 2007 child and obesity prevention recommendations as a guideline for the intervention and adopted concepts from evidence -based, multi -component programs and curricula including Media Smart Youth; We Can! Energize Our Families; Nutrition to Grow On; and Eat Healthy, Be Active. Community members representing the targeted audience also participated in the design and implementation plans. In 2015, NYU LFHC piloted the Healthy Families Program /Programa de Familias Saludables , a 12 -session multi - disciplinary program for 10- to 11 -year- old obese Hispanic children and their parent(s). Parents are included as participants since evidence shows that programs that engage family members have greater success in stabilizing or reducing children's BMI . The intervention focuses on this age group because it is the time when children become more independent from thei r parents and are able to evaluate and alter their dietary habits and attitudes. The program is designed to: Stabilize BMI and BMI z -scores; Improve the following behaviors based on 5 -2-1-0, a nationally recognized childhood obesity prevention program: 23 Consumption of fruit and vegetables (5 or more fruits and vegetables per day ); Daily screen time (2 hours or less of recreational screen time p er day) ; Physical activity (1 hour or more of daily physical activity) ; Sugar -sweetened beverages (0 sugary drinks). The cu rriculum is culturally relevant to the local Hispanic population and sessions are conducted in English and Spanish. Each session consists of: Customized n utrition education focusing on the 5 - 2-1-0 model facilitated by a nutritionist ; Separate support groups for parents and children that address questions, help them adopt strategies for setting limits and promoting healthy behaviors, and build peer support ; Physical fitness focused on low- or no cost activities that can be done at home or through local community resources . These sessions are led by NYU Lutheran rehabilitation staff together with l ocal partners, which have provided pro bono programming such as martial arts and dance. A primary care physician consults on participants' health and makes re ferrals to social supports and specialists as needed. Progress and Impact We began recruitment for the program in fall 2014, and a pilot cycle was launched in early 2015. The target program size is 12 children (and one parent or caregiver). Twenty children were recruited for the pilot, nine enrolled and six completed nine or more sessions. Measurements at the end of the 12 -week intervention and at the three- month, post -program follow - up indicated stabilization of BMI percentiles . Self-repo rts indicated behavior change in target areas. Children reported increased intake of fruits (affirmed by parent reports), and, according to parents, children's exercise regimens also increased. Data from follow -up measurements at 6 and 12 months post -intervention are being analyzed to determine the program's longer -term impact on weight and BMI. During the second half of 2015 , we used process and outcome data as a guide to make further adaptions to the program. Adjustments included extending the age ran ge to include nine -year olds; implementing electronic pediatrician referrals to the program; refining program elements to encourage changes in screen time and beverage consumption; and adding a nutritionist home -visit to reinforce and individualize healthy shopping and cooking practices. Local Partners Providing Pro Bono Services Sunset Park Martial Arts, Inc. Sunset Park Martial Arts is a family -oriented school workin g to keep youth off the streets while teaching them respect, humility, discipline, responsibility, self -defense, and most of all, a way to a healthier lifestyle. Kar -Do-Jitsu -Ryu (KDJR) - the mixed martial art form practiced at Sunset Park Martial Arts - was founded by John F. Manniel III out of a deep commitment to the neighborhood's young people. Young Dancers in Repertory Young Dancers In Repertory (YDR), a community -based nonprofit arts organization, has provided professional dance training to the Brooklyn community for more than 30 years. YDR fosters growth and communication through creative educational arts programming and performances for youth and the general public. Brooklyn Health Brooklyn Health and Performance has been providing research- based, best practice fitness training and coaching to Sunset Park and surrounding neighborhoods since 2015. The team provides customized fitness services to ensure individuals, sports teams, and corporate groups have the tools to reach their goals. 24 Healthy Families/ Familias Saludables participants (children, parents, and siblings) doing yoga, one of a variety of family -friendly physical activities participants engage in during the program. In fall 2015, NYU Langone Department of Population Health Center for Healthcare Innovation and Delivery Science (CHIDS) awarded a grant to support the implementation and study of the Healthy Families Program. Three cycles will be completed by September 20 16 and we are anticipating the results in fall 2016. The team has presented at the Community Health Centers Association of New York State Annual Conference, National Hispanic Medical Association Annual Conference, and the NYU Lutheran Annual Research Fair, where the program was recognized as one of the \"Projects of Distinction ,\" as demonstrated by exceptional impact, quality, and congruence with Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) Social Statement, \"Caring for Health: Our Shared Endeavor.\" Plans During the 2017 -2019 Community Service Plan, we plan to implement the program in school - based health centers and expand from one site to four sites, with two cycles per year at each site. School -based health centers offer medical and mental health service s on-site at local schools and offer a unique opportunity to base the program directly where children spend their day. We will continue to use process and outcome data gathered during and after the program to monitor our progress and inform program design and implementation. Greenlight : Preventing Chronic Disease Taking advantage of the frequency of primary care pediatric visits in the early years of life, during the 201 4-2016 CSP , the Department of Pediatrics at NYUHC , in partnership with the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center (CBWCHC) , adapted an evidence -based program that teaches families about healthy eating and activity in order to prevent early childhood obesity in the Chinese American community. The Greenlight program, which was developed as part of an NIH -funded grant in settings that serve predominan tly low -income black and The Charles B. Wang Community Health Center For more than 40 years, the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center has been a leader in providing high quality, affordable, and culturally competent primary care and support services to medically underserved Asian Americans and other disadvantaged populations in the New York metropolitan area. The Pediatric Clinic at the CBWCHC Chinatown site serves close to 8,500 patients, through over 30,000 visits annually to their primary care and subspecialty clinics. 25 Hispanic families, trains pediatricians how to communicate with families using toolkits that contain culturally -tailored educational materials for people with low literacy. Approximately 90 million Americans \u2014or 45 percent of the population \u2014have basic or below basic literacy skills, and 110 million have basic or below basic quantitative skills. Minority, immigrant families are at increased risk. Low health literacy and numeracy is associated with lower rates of breastfeeding, difficulty understanding food labels and portion sizes, and higher rates of obesity. Greenlight focuses on improving health literacy and fostering family engagement through three core components : Low literacy toolkits to support physician counseling around diet and activity -related behaviors at well- child visits starting at 2 months of age, which include booklets containing age-specific recommendations and 'tangible tools' to support evidence -based obesity prevention messages (e.g. portion size snack cups); Training of providers in health communication strategies (use of plain language, supplementing counseling with written information, along with teachback and goal setting); Waiting room program where health educators promote family engagement in care as they introduce and support Greenlight messages. Early intervention for Chinese American immigrants is critically important in preventing obesity and its health consequences later in life. A study several years ago by CBWCHC found that 25% of the children in the pediatric practice (drawn largely from th e Chinatown area) were overweight or obese. Among U.S. born boys ages 6 -12, the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity was 40%. This problem is magnified by the fact that Asian populations appear to be more vulnerable to the onset of Type II diabe tes at lower weights. For many immigrant groups, each subsequent generation is at increased risk for obesity and for the development of diabetes. By engaging families in the pediatric setting, Greenlight can prevent this health trajectory for the Chinese American population, which is among the fastest growing immigrant groups in NYC. Progress and Impact In adapting the Greenlight program for Chinese American immigrant families, the team strove to go beyond translating language and changing e thnicity in photographs. As one community member observed, \"Translation is necessary, complicated and insufficient.\" Greenlight materials reflect deeper cultural values, norms and lifestyle differences. (For specific examples, view the Greenlight team's poster, which they recently presented at National 26 Association of Community Health Centers annual conf erence, where it won 2nd prize: http://bit.ly/24wXUci ) The cultural adaptation process has been complex, and included outreach to over 160 parents. Three focus groups were conducted with parents (two in Mandarin and one in Cantonese), and two focus groups were conducted with 17 providers/health educators. In addition, providers (physicians, nurses, nutritionists) and health educators have given individual feedback on the materials throughout the translation and adapt ation process. The materials - some of which are shown here - reflect the judgment and care of many participants. Over the past year, we have rolled out a full set of Greenlight materials at CBWCHC (core and supplemental booklets translated into Tradi tional and Simplified Chinese, along with 'tangible' tools), trained pediatric providers, and begun to enroll families into the Greenlight program. To date, we have trained 19 providers (4 health educators, 11 pediatricians, 2 nurses, 2 nutritionists); co mpleted baseline surveys of 285 parent/child -dyads to assess baseline behaviors, attitudes, and practices, and child weight; and recruited 78 parent/child -dyads who will be followed as they receive the program from 2 months through 2 years of age. Based o n tracking data from CBWCHC's EMR system, after rollout of the Greenlight program, 193 sessions of provider counseling have involved provision of Greenlight messages, and 154 health education sessions have taken place. An additional 81 parents have receiv ed the waiting room program as part the piloting and development stage of the program. For many immigrant groups, each subsequent generation is at increased risk for obesity and for the development of diabetes. By engaging families in the pediatric setting, Greenlight can prevent this health trajectory for the Chinese American population, which is one of the fastest growing immigrant groups in NYC. Plans Over the next three years, we plan to continue to implement the Greenlight program at CBWCHC. We will examine the impact of the culturally adapted Greenlight program on parent/family knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to their child's diet and physical activity. We will also begin to explore strategies for expanding the program through: Dissemination of Greenlight materials to the CBWCHC Flushing site; 27 Expansion of the Greenlight program to NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers' Brooklyn Chinese site in Sunset Park, Brooklyn; Adaptation of Greenlight into an online web resource, with Gree nlight booklets available as digital flipbooks; Dissemination of the culturally adapted and translated Greenlight materials to other health facilities in the rest of NYC and across the country by making materials available for providers on -line, and leveraging existing relationships with groups like the Community Health Care Association of New York, Chinese American Medical Society (CAMS), Coalition of Asian -American Independent Practice Association (CAIPA)), the American Academy of Pediatrics and th e Academic Pediatric Association; and Adaptation of Greenlight to other settings, such as daycare centers and schools, including other partners in the Community Service Plan. Over the course of the next three years of the Community Service Plan, we expect Greenlight to reach over 1 ,500 children and families. Two Generations : Promoting Healthy Women, Infants and Children Two Generations, a new program that seeks to reduce the negative health impact of perinatal depression and adverse childhood events on maternal and child physical and mental health, is being launched in CD 3 in partnership with Gouverneur Health and in Sun set Park in the NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers. Children born into poverty are at risk for far- reaching negative physical and mental health effects, perpetuating cycles of disadvantage into adulthood. Maternal stressors during the prenatal period increase the risk of pre- and postnatal depression, the likelihood of pregnancy complications and adverse birth outcomes, and decreased responsiveness in the newborn, as well as reduced mother -child interactions, harsh discipline, lower initiation of breast feedin g, over feeding, and increased emergency d epartment visits. Fetal exposure to maternal stress in pregnancy negatively impacts a child's neuro -development and increases the likelihood of poor health outcomes, such as delays in communication, socioemo tional competence, cognitive functioning, behavioral problems, and chronic conditions. These adverse early influences in turn set the stage for subsequent impaired scholastic achievement, conduct disorder, criminal justice system involvement, and a trajec tory of disadvantage. In the first year of this Community Service Plan, we will lay the groundwork for implementing a cross -site intervention that would seamlessly implement effective tools to mitigate these life - long impacts in perinatal and pediatric care in the NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers and in partnership with NYC Health + Hospitals' Gouverneur Health. In this exploratory phase, we will develop and ref ine a program model that will integrate a comprehensive set of evidence -based 28 interventions that cross the birth -line and thus have the potential to simultaneously improve outcomes for two generations. These include: Healthy Steps, Starting Early (StEP), Reach Out Stay Strong Essentials (ROSE), STRONG Moms, and the Video Interaction Project. The goal is to develop a project model that will: Address maternal stressors, improve maternal mental health, and facilitate maternal engagement in positive interacti ons and behaviors with the child; Facilitate positive and responsive parent -child interactions to enhance the parent -child relationship and child outcomes, and simultaneously reduce stress and enhance coping for mothers with depressive symptoms; and Transform the coordination of care across the prenatal and pediatric settings through training and supporting staff in the delivery of continuous, comprehensive, and culturally effective care to increase family engagement, deliver more timely and effective screening and interventions, facilitate referral to behavioral care, and enhance maternal and child outcomes. Sector: housing Health+Housing Project : Preventing Chronic Disease Poor health is often concentrated within the same neighborhoods that face concentrated poverty and other social ills. People living in such neighborhoods have high levels of chronic disease, mental illness, and exposure to environmental risks such as injury and violence. Not surprisingly, they concomitantly have high use of costly health care services, including frequent emergency department visits and hospitalizations. With the growing gentrification of CD 3, people living in subsidized, low -income apartment buildings - who are more likely to have multiple health risks and needs - are in danger of becoming increasingly isolated. This is of great concern in the community. To address these needs, this year we launched a pilot Community Health Worker (CHW) program in two low-income buildings in partnership with Henry Street Settlement, the NYU Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy, the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), Hester Street Collaborative, the Chinatown Y MCA and with support from the Robin Hood Foundation. The program is place -base d (located in the two buildings); addresses Henry Street Settlement Founded in 1893 by Lillian Wald, Henry Street Settlement opens doors of opportunity to enrich lives and enhance human progress for Lower East Side residents and other New Yorkers through social services, arts, and health care programs. Each year, Henry Street Settlement serves 60,000 individuals throu gh social services, arts and health care programs. Through these programs, seniors received nutrition, case management and other vital services; youth received educational, recreational and employment services; members of our community received primary and mental health care, free legal and financial counseling and help accessing benefits including low -cost health insurance; homeless individuals and families received shelter and supportive services; the unemployed or underemployed were connected to jobs, an d thousands of individuals of all ages were provided access to the arts, including dance, music, theater and visual arts. 29 social, environmental, and structural determinants of health in addition to promoting healthy behaviors and effective use of the healthcare system; and is tailored to the specific needs of building residents. Progress Thus far, we have held four workshops to understand more about residents' needs and priorities , and community surveyors completed a total of 374 baseline surveys in the two buildings with adults 18 years and older, representing a participation rate of about 45%. Of the residents wh o completed a baseline survey, 73% expressed an interest in meeting with a CHW and participating in the program. Bilingual CHWs (Chinese/English and Spanish/English) have been hired and trained, and are now working in both buildings. They are using motiv ational interviewing techniques to guide residents through a goal -setting activity, and then together they develop an action plan for the resident to achieve those goals. CHWs provide coaching on health behaviors, help residents navigate environmental and structural issues in their apartments, and connect residents to health and social services. As part of an evaluation of the program, we plan to measure changes in residents' emergency department use, hospital days, insurance coverage, and overall physical and mental health. Summary of survey results: Among the 374 survey respondents, 50% expressed having one or more food security concerns, and nearly 40% described their general health as fair or poor. Building residents suffer from higher rates of c hronic disease than NYC adults overall: 33% have been diagnosed with hypertension, 16% with diabetes, and 21% with asthma; this compares to city-wide rates of 28%, 11%, and 11%, respectively. Surveyed residents are also more likely to be current smokers than New Yorkers overall (18%, compared with 14%). The vast majority of respondents have health insurance (95%) and have seen a doctor in the past 6 months (84%). Despite this, their use of emergency departments remains high, with nearly 35% of respondent s reporting that they had one or more visit to an emergency department in the past year. This supports a growing body of research indicating that social determinants of health are critical, and that The NYU Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy The Furman Center is a joint center of NYU's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and School of Law. Since its founding in 1995, the NYU Furman Center has become a leading academic resea rch center devoted to housing and land use policy. The mission of the Furman Center is to provide objective academic and empirical research on the legal and public policy issues involving neighborhood change, land use, housing, and mortgage finance in the United States; promote frank and productive discussions about those issues; and present essential data and analysis about the state of housing and neighborhoods in the nation's leading urban areas. 30 access to health insurance and regular medical care alon e are insufficient for producing optimal health, particularly in lower- income patients. Plans Over the 15-month intervention , we expect to provide services to 1 50-200 residents. The pilot stage of the Health+Housing Project will be completed by October 2017 and evaluation results will be available by early 2018. We will then explore replication of the model in Brooklyn and with our partners - DOHMH, NYCHA, HPD, the Archdiocese of New York and Wavecrest Management - all of whom are interested in the Health+Housing Project as a potentially replicable model for other low -income housing developments across the City. Sector: community Tobacco Free Community : Preventing Chronic Disease In partnership with Asian Americans for Equality (AAFE) and the Asian Smokers' Quitline , experts from the Section on Tobacco, Alcohol, and Drug Use in NYUHC's Department of Population Health are implementing a community navigator model, which mirrors the patient navigator model that has been well studied and implement ed by the American Cancer Society. This model provides lay workers or resident/ community volunteers the skills to educate and motivate people in the community to address modifiable health risks, like tobacco use, and link community members to evidence based smoking cessation resources. Despite the availability of safe and effective treatment for tobacco dependence, only a small proportion of smokers who try to quit each year use cessation therapies. This is particularly true among low -income adults and for non-English language speakers, contributing to growing disparities in smoking prevalence. The Community Service Plan navigator program is designed to address this gap. Progress and Impact Training: In our first year of the Community Service Plan, NYULMC experts on tobacco cessation provided comprehensive training to 14 staff from community based organizations and separately trained 11 members of the AAFE staff. Our approach is comprehensive, raisin g awareness about the often hidden threat of SHS in multiunit housing and ensuring that smokers have access to evidence -based treatment. Training focused on the use of Motivational Interviewing techniques to: (a) assess readiness to change smoking Asian Americans for Equality Since its founding in 1974, Asian Americans for Equality (AAFE) has evolved into a nationally recognized affordable housing developer and social service provider, serving New York City's one million Asian American residents. Services include community development and housing preservation, housing legal services, community education, citizenship preparation, and social services. AAFE has led campaigns to promote equal employment, affordable housing, fair housing, transportation equity, local economic deve lopment, community lending, civic participation, healthcare access, immigrant rights, and educational access. As a partner of the NYC Coalition for a Smoke -Free City, AAFE provide s culturally competent and linguistically accessible smoking prevention educ ation and smoking cessation to Asian American communities, and leads grassroots advocacy campaigns to build support for key initiatives such as smoke -free outdoor air and smoke -free housing. 31 behavio r; (b) employ strategies to increase motivation; (c) inform smokers about free evidence based smoking cessation resources (e.g., Medicaid covers cessation medication with a prescription and free counseling and nicotine replacement therapy available through the New York State and Asian Smokers' Quitline); and (d) for those ready to quit, link smokers to services including arranging doctor appointments and connecting smokers to the New York State or Asian Smokers Quitline. The program was extremely well -received, with all participants reporting significant increases in knowledge and confidence. Responding to requests from our partners and other community groups and agencies, we have continued to provide tobacco cessation trainings to our community partner s, including two separate trainings with staff members from AAFE (3) and health educators at CBWCHC (9). In 2016, we provided a lecture/training for 60 attendees at the annual Chinese American Medical Society (CAMS) meeting and we continue to provide trai ning for physician members of the Chinese American Independent Practice Association (CAIPA). Outreach: Since the inception of the Community Service Plan, building on AAFE's existing programs and relationships in the community, we have reached over 970 smokers, many of whom had never previously tried to quit or cut down. Of the 183 that completed the basel ine interview, 146 (80%) were given nicotine replacement therapy. Of the 126 smokers that were followed -up at two weeks, 105 (83%) reported using the nicotine replacement therapy, 78 (62%) reported cutting back on smoking, and 29 (23%) quit altogether. We are also tracking calls to the Asian Smokers Quitline, which provides smoking cessation counseling. Since implementation of outreach, 76 calls were completed. Sustainability: AAFE now screens for tobacco use on all of its intake forms (for housing, insurance, small business development) and provides information about smoking cessation at community meetings on a wide array of topics. This kind of institutional change in practice is an important element of community capacity building and a way to ensure s ustainability. In addition, growing out of this partnership, the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center was awarded a grant from the RCHN Community Health Foundation to address the high rates of smoking among Chinese American men. Activities include: Developing a bi -lingual smoking cessation coaching program; 32 Providing smoking cessation counseling and personalized follow -up to support changes in smoking behaviors; Developing communication strategies to deliver key anti- smoking messages through print, broadcast and digital media platforms (first press conference for Chinese language media held on November 18, 2015); Training and encouraging private practice physicians to adopt tobacco screening, counseling, and referral protocols; and Establishing multi- sector partnerships to deliver key messages and services. Through this new initiative, beginning in November 2015, Charles B. Wang Community Health Center internal medicine providers have referred 72 smokers, 60 of whom received counseling by a health educator; 40% (24/60) quit smoking for at least one day and 72 % (43/60) reduced their smoking. Plans Outreach: Over the next three years, in collaboration with AAFE, we plan to reach out to 2-5 community - based organizations annually, including senior centers and Family Associations. Our goal is to work with these organizations to raise awareness about the dangers of smoking and secondhand smoke, to provide smoking cessation counseling and referrals to cli ents and members, and to help Family Associations adopt smoke -free policies. We also plan to continue our community -based outreach to smokers with the goal of reaching at least 100 each year - continuing our work on the Lower East Side/Chinatown and expan ding into Sunset Park. Training: We also plan to offer additional training on tobacco cessation to the more than 2,000 members of the Chinese American Medical Society and the Chinese American Independent Practice Association. Our goal is to help raise their awareness of the importance of incorporating smoking cessation into everyday practice and of the resources that are available to help smokers quit. Policy: We plan to work with the New York City DOHMH and with New York City Housing Authority leadership to explore strategies to educate and engage the community about smoking cessation and the dangers of secondhand smoke in order to support the implementation of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development's landmark new policy on smoke free publ ic housing. Finally, to inform our strategies and to raise the visibility of the prevalence of smoking among Asian American men, we plan to conduct a cross sectional survey of 2 00 Asian Americans in Chinatown and Sunset Park to: 33 Assess knowledge, attitude s and beliefs about smoking and the dangers of secondhand smoke among Asian Americans living in Chinatown and Sunset Park; Explore the cigarette purchasing patterns among Asian American smokers; and Assess exposure to tobacco and counter tobacco media mess aging. Project SAFE : Promoting Healthy Women, Infants and Children There are substantial disparities in teen birth rates by ethnicity and poverty in New York City. Sunset Park has the 12 th highest teen birth rate in NYC (33.2 births per 1,000 girls age s 15-19, compared to 24.0 in Brooklyn, and 23. 6 citywide). Findings from our Teen Sexual Healthcare Access Survey indicate that t he primary teen pregnancy risk factors for Sunset Park are poverty and low educational attainment , high rates of intimate part ner violence, large numbers of disconnected youth, adolescents having limited knowledge of family planning and discomfort speaking to partners and adults , and fears about breach of confidentiality. Project SAFE prevents unintended pregnancy and the spread of STDs and HIV/AIDS through evidence -based interventions within a youth development framework that builds upon the existing strengths of young people. Project SAFE has been providing teen leadership , culturally appropriate sexual health information and services , and HIV peer education programming at the Project Reach Youth (PRY) site in Brooklyn since 1989. The program provides youth ages 14 to 19 with the support and the opportunities to avoid risky behaviors and to develop to their full potential and become agents of change in their communities. The program model includes evidence -based sexual health workshops, peer -led health education groups and community events, and sexual health services designed to meet the unique needs of adolescents . Progress and Impact Multi -Session Workshop Series : Project SAFE works with partners to provide pregnancy prevention workshops to youth in underserved communities in Brooklyn. The program utilizes two, six -session evidence -based sexual health curricula - Be Proud! Be Responsible (BPBR) and Here's what teens sa id about Project SAFE programs: \"Being in SAFE is like a family. We learn, we play, we help each other, we help others, and it's just an amazing atmosphere.\" \"I had stay[ed] in Project SAFE this long because it had provide[d] a sense of home. In PRY [Project Reach Youth] I had been able to be myself and not be judged.\" \"It is fun but at the same time it is an educational place where we learn to stay safe. Also the environment is very welcoming and you know everyone here.\" 34 4Me! (part of the Teen Health Project evidence- based intervention) . Topics covered include pregnancy and STD/HIV prevention, as well as confidence, pride, and respect -building activities. From 2014 to the present, Project SAFE facilitated 58 cycles of BPBR and 53 cycles of the 4Me! curricula, reaching a total of 2,857 youth in high schools, community -based organizations, and high school equivalency programs. Post -workshop evaluations reveal an increase in self- reported awareness and knowledge, a nd positive intended behaviors: 84% of workshop participants reported that they are more likely to either wait to have sex, or use condoms; 89% know more about how to protect themselves from pregna ncy and STIs; 75% said that they feel more comfortable talking to a partner about safer sex; 78% know where they can get tested for STIs because of the workshop series. Peer Education Groups: Youth who complete the workshop series transition into the Project SAFE Teen Health Council, an introductory peer health education group. In the Teen Health Council, peer educators learn the basics of workshop facilitation, community event planning, and o utreach strategies, while engaging in activities that focus on com munity and group connectedness. After completing the semester -long Teen Health Council, teens can then transition into one of the advanced peer education groups. Facilitated by an adult pr oject facilitator and a peer leader, the group s offer a variety of ways for youth to have a positive impact in their community. The current groups are: Theater : Peer educators create and perform pieces that explore issues of safer sex, gender, culture, identity, and HIV/AIDS prevention using movement, poetry, and drama ; The Lab : Peer educators use social media , such as Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, and YouTube , to reach high -risk youth and provide sexual health education ; Dance : The dance group trains participants in various dance styles and prepares them to develop performances that celebrate wellness and healthy relationships ; Ambassadors : Youth are trained to facilitate sexual health workshops for their peers at schools and community events. Participants have statistically significant increases in: frequency of condom use; HIV knowledge; knowledge of HIV status; and knowledge of STD status. In addition, participants demonstrate increases in school connectedness and self -efficacy, which have been shown to be protective factors against HIV. Community Events and Single -Session Workshops : Throughout the year, peer educators and Project SAFE staff work collaboratively to produce a series of community events to promote teen sexual health. The events typically include performances from the arts-based groups and an open mic session in which guests and community members can perform. Most of these community events also offer on -site HIV testing and promote teen health services available through P roject SAFE and other community organizations. From 2014 to the present, Project SAFE hosted or performed at 26 community events reaching 1,829 youth, of whom 237 received HIV testing. The events received overwhelmingly positive feedback and young people reported Awards Project SAFE social media peer educators recently were honored for winning the 2016 \"Echo your Healthy Choice\" award for a video they created about healthy teen relationships. The award was presented to the group at this year's NYC Teen Dating Violence Awareness Walk. 35 increase d knowledge about healthy relationships (61%); feeling more comfortable encouraging others to get tested for HIV (57%); and feeling more comfortable using a condom (60%). Project SAFE also offers single -session sexual health workshops facilitated by trained p eer educators with program staff. We have reached 921 young people through 41 single -session sexual health workshops from 2014 to the present. Project SAFE works with community partners such as Turning Point to reach at -risk youth and young adults. As a result of the workshops, most participants know more about how to prevent HIV and are more likely to practice safer sex or abstain from sex (91% and 76%% respectively , as self- reported on a post -workshop survey). Teen Health Clinic: Project SAFE partnered with NYU LFHC primary care services to establish the Teen Health Clinic, designing systems to be as teen -friendly as possible and providing young people with a heal th care experience tailored to their needs. The Project SAFE Teen Health Clinic offers youth a non -judgmental, personal approach to sexual health, with a teens -only waiting room and a staff, including Project SAFE staff and peer educators, who are trained to use an empowering, strength s-based approach. The clinic addresses the barriers youth experience in accessing sexual health services such as stigmatization, fear of parental disapproval, and lack of access to confidential health coverage. The clinic offers a full range of sexual health counseling and clinical services. Plans Over the next two years, Project SAFE plans to broaden the reach of our evidence -based workshop series and serve an additional 200 students annually by working with high schools connected to NYU LFHC sc hool -based health center sites. The program also plans to more explicitly incorporate reproductive justice, which addresses the complete physical, mental, spiritual, political, social, and economic well- being of women and girls based on the full achievement and protection of women's human rights . Project SAFE has been working with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to train staff to facilitate reproductive justice -focused community gatherings for youth. These sessions will gather information about how young people view the link between reproductive rights and social justice . Building on these efforts, Project SAFE plans to establish a new peer education group focusing on reproductive justice. It will be designed to provide youth with skills and resources to enhance their leadership abilities and to support them in embodying their role as social change agents. In this group, youth will select a reproductive justice issue that is important to them and, with the guidance of the facilitator, initiate a project (such as a workshop, social media campaign, or public demonstration) to address the issue. 36 REACH FAR: Preventing Chronic Disease Building on the important role that faith -based organizations can play in affecting the health of immigrants and racial and ethnic minority populations, the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health for Asia n AmeRicans ( REACH FAR) program will partner with mosques on the Lower East Side and in Sunset Park to improve blood pressure control and promote healthy eating using a three -pronged approach: (1) nutritional strategies, including education and changes to communal foo d practices; (2) blood pressure control training and monitoring; and (3) culturally tailored communications and education. Progress and Impact With support from the Centers for Disease Control, REACH FAR has worked with community partners (United Sikhs, DREAM Coalition, Korean Community Services, and Kalusugan Coalition) and 12 faith -based organizations to increase access to healthy food and beverage options and deliver culturally and linguistically appropriate health coaching for management and preventi on of high blood pressure in Asian American communities. As part of this effort, REACH FAR has adapted Keep on Track, an evidence -based train -the-trainer program developed by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene , to screen, monitor, and provide counseling to people with high blood pressure. Keep on Track has been implemented in 120 faith -based and community -based settings across New York City, but previously had not been adapted for or implemented in Asian American communities. REACH FAR activ ities are supported by a comprehensive social marketing campaign to raise awareness of hypertension prevention and treatment and to promote hypertension screening events at faith - based and other organizations. REACH FAR has also culturally adapted and disseminated materials on hypertension and nutrition created by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Centers for Disease Control Million Hearts initiative and distributed 37 these materials in a variety of community venues such as he alth care settings, grocery stores, restaurants, and faith -based and community -based organizations. Plans Building on these efforts and the materials and strategies that have been developed, in Year 1 REACH FAR will work with the two mosques in the Lower East Side: Assafa Islamic Center and Madina Masjid. Assafa has a total of 1500 congregants and average weekly attendance at Friday Jummah prayers of 250 congregants. Madina Masjid has a congregation s ize of 2000 and average weekly attendance at Friday Jummah prayers of 400 congregants. In Years 2 and 3, we plan to extend the rea ch of the program by engaging a two additional mosques serving the South Asian and Middle Eastern community in the Sunset Par k area. Working with mosque leadership, we will identify a health champion or committee, administer a baseline survey and organizational assessment and then collaboratively develop a plan to: (1) introduce policies and practices regarding serving healthy foods during communal meals or enhancing existing menus to incorporate healthy meal options (e.g., lower fat dairy products, serving brown rice); (2) implement a volunteer -led blood pressure screening program (using the Keep on Track model); and (3) suppo rt program efforts with a communication strategy to inform community members about program activities and to increase awareness of the risk of cardiovascular disease. All program elements will be monitored to track progress, fidelity and satisfaction, as well as behavior change. Other Apart from the programs outlined above, which are supported directly by NYUHC as part of the Community Service Plan, NYUHC has numerous community programs that address unmet community need. See Appendix D. Dissemination The Community Health Needs Assessment and Community Service Plan, together with our Progress Report s, are conspicuously posted on the NYUHC internal and external websites with instructions for downloading and in a format that , when accessed, downloaded, vi ewed, and printed in hard copy, exactly reproduces the image the individual seeking access to these materials is not required to create an account or provide any personally identifiable information. Hard copies of the Community Health Needs Assessment, Community Service Plan and Progress Report s are available without charge to anyone upon request and are regularly distributed to Community Board members , policym akers, local health centers, community based organizations, community members , and other interested stakeholders. Through our outreach and engagement activities, we continually seek to keep the community informed about our activities and to get feedback and input. This year we also sent out an electronic newsletter to nearly 400 people, including policymakers, partners, community groups and colleagues (see: http://eepurl.com/bDaEgv ). 38 The Executive Summary of our Community Health Needs Assessment and Community Service Plan shares our analysis and conclusions in a more accessible format f or a broader constituency. This document , which is written at an 8th grade literacy level, has been translated into Arabic, Chinese, and Spanish. In addition, information about the Community Service Plan has been presented at conferences (the Population Health Summit of 2015, the Community Health Association of NY State Statewide Conference 2015), and the National Hispanic Medical Association Annual Conference and in presentations to Primary Care Residents, medical students and undergraduate students. We plan to conduct similar internal and external presentations for the 2017 -2019 Community Service Plan. Community Engagement An overarching goal of the Community Service Plan is to help improve the health of the populations of the Lower East Side/Chinatown and Sunset Park . We have continued to engage our partners and the broader community through a variety of mechanisms with the objective of creating an infrastructure for the ongoing exchange of informati on and ideas and a platform for continued cross -sector work at the neighborhood level to address high priority public health issues. Early in the first year of the NYU Langone Medical Center Community Service Plan , we created a Coordinating Council compos ed of NYU faculty and staff and leadership and staff of our community partners. The Coordinating Council has met every three months to coordinate the various projects and ensur e that they are meeting milestones, maximizing their impact, and working across institutions and sectors. As we have identified shared challenges and opportunities, we have invited expert consultants - from across New York University as well as other institutions - to discuss issues of behavior change, cross cultural communication, community -based participatory approaches to program development and evaluation, and motivational interviewing. In addition to its regular meetings, in the first year, the Coordinating Council also sponsored a community forum on the changing demographics of CD 3 , with presentations by Joseph Salvo, PhD, and Peter Lobo, PhD, Director and Deputy Director respectively of the Demography Division of the NYC Office of City Planning. This event was attended by over 50 people, including staff and leadership from all of our partner organizations, the District Manager and staff of Manhattan Community Board 3, and central Medical Center administrators. We also periodically invite outside speakers to the meetings of the Coordinating Council. In 2015 -2016, we heard presentations from representatives from the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs Direct Access Program and from a collective impact program in Astoria and Long Island City, Zone 126. Members of the Coordinating Council also attend presentations of interest at the Medical Center. Over a dozen leaders and staff from our community partners attended the Department of Population Health's inaugural Health and... conference, which brought together leading investigators, policymakers, practitioners, and community le aders to better leverage the intersection between Health and... its many determinants . 39 Over the course of our Plan, our relationships with our partners, as well as with other groups in the community, have grown. For example, the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center has repeatedly welcomed a group of medical students, and is working with other NYU HC faculty on a variety of initiatives. We partnered with Asian Americans for Equality and CBWCHC to develop a grant proposal that was funded by the RCHN Commu nity Health Foundation to support and expand their tobacco -related work. And we work with other organizations, including the Two Bridges Neighborhood Council, in their efforts to increase access to healthy food and to support physical activity on the Lowe r East we continue to meet with advocates, service providers, and co mmunity groups, including committees of Manhattan Community Board 3 as well as Manhattan Community Board 6 to provide regular updates and opportunities for input. NYU Lutheran has historically embraced collaboration as the foundation of successful service development and implementation, actively seeking community involvement in its programs as part of its management philosophy. Supporting the Community Service Plan over the past three years, these relationships have provided ongoing opportunities f or interaction, including the joint development of programming. Our commitment to pediatric obesity focused on, but was not limited to, the development and implementation of the Healthy Families program. Working in collaboration with a network of early childhood centers and family child care providers, NYU LFHC secured a grant from the Aetna Foundation to focus on obesity prevention in the youngest ages, providing parent education and staff development for teachers and kitchen staff. Of particular note is our long history and strong relationships with schools. Our collaborative programming has included the development and operation of an extensive network of over 30 school -based health centers, participation in the City and State's Community Schools in itiatives, and extensive youth development programming in elementary and high schools. Capitalizing on these relationships, we plan to increase the reach of the Healthy Families program by expanding to additional sites through school -based health centers and after- school programs. School -based and high school equivalency programs also serve as expansion opportunities for Project SAFE, the peer education program selected as a new priority focus for 2017 -2019. While not a focus of our CSP in the prior three years, adolescent -focused prevention services have been expanded through funding from the New York City Department of Youth and Community Development. We have also successfully expanded opportunities available to participating youth in partnership with the Pinkerton Foundation, which enabled us to offer college access services as part of our overall youth development strategy. Anticipated Impact and Performance Measures The Coordinating Council, currently composed of the community par tners and NYUHC program leaders, will expand to include colleagues from NYU Lutheran and partners from Sunset Park. The Council will continue to oversee program implementation , work collaboratively to find 40 points of synergy across programs and neighborhoo ds, and assess progress and make mid - course corrections. In addition, each program collects data about levels of participation , participant satisfaction , and impact on health and well -being. This is done through attenda nce records, surveys, and other for ms of data collection. Attached as Appendix E is a table summarizing preliminary goals and performance measures, together with sources of data to be used to measure outcomes. 41 Appendix A Data Sources Consulted Au, L., Kwong , K., Chou , J.C., Tso A ., Wong , M. 2009.

A family -centered intervention, ParentCorps promotes foundational skills in pre -kindergarten and improves achievement test scores and behavioral and physical health in eleme ntary school. ParentCorps works by strengthening family engagement and helping parents and teachers provide high- quality environments. ParentCorps builds adults' capacity to use evidence- based practices to create safe, nurturing and predictable environme nts in which children thrive. ParentCorps' approach includes the following elements considered essential for achieving positive impact. ParentCorps: Promotes foundational skills for students as they make the critical transition to school. Engages diver se parents as partners and creates networks of knowledgeable, empowered and capable parents throughout the school community. Builds on the strengths of culturally -diverse students and families and includes tailored proactive strategies to address the needs of students with challenging behavior. Incorporates \"best practices\" from mental health, education and professional learning to provide supportive, safe and inspiring spaces for educators and parents to work together on their shared goal of helping young children to succeed. Supports sustainable changes in the early childhood workforce to strengthen program quality, ensure that pre -k and related services are culturally relevant, and promote racial equity and equal opportunities for every student to succeed. Evidence base Two federally -funded, randomized controlled trials with more than 1,200 poor, minority NYC children have found that ParentCorps results in more supportive and nurturing home and early childhood classroom environments, higher kindergarten achievement te st scores (reading, writing and math) and, among the highest -risk children, lower rates of obesity and mental health problems. A benefit -cost analysis indicates that ParentCorps has the potential to yield cost savings of more than $2,500 per student .

Program addresses needs of low income populatio ns, particularly Latino and Asian American families Greenlight Goal Prevent Chronic Disease by lowering rates of childhood obesity in the Chinese American community Outcome o bjectives Intermediate Improved parent/family knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to their child's diet and physical activity Increased parent/family engagement in children's health Increased parent confidence / empowerment Increased staff knowledge and awareness Improved provider engagement and satisfaction Greater provider use of recommended health communication strategies Long -Term Healthier eating behaviors / practices for children/ families Increased physical activity / decreased sedentary time for children Reduced media exposure Exploratory goal: 20% re lative reduction in rate of obesity from ~25% to ~20% among 3 -5 year olds Overview Taking advantage of the frequency of primary care pediatric visits in the early years of life, the Department of Pediatrics a t NYUHC, in partnership with the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center, has adapted an evidence -based program that teaches families about healthy eating and activity in order to prevent early childhood obesity in the Chinese American community. The Greenlight program, which was developed as part of a n NIH -funded grant in settings that serve predominantly low -income black and Hispanic families, trains pediatricians how to communicate with families using toolkits that contain culturally -tailored educational materials for people with low literacy. Greenlight focuses on improving health literacy and fostering family engagement through three core components: Low literacy toolkits to support physician counseling around diet and activity- related behaviors at well -child visits starting at 2 months of age, which include booklets containing age -specific recommendations and 'tangible tools' to support evidence -based obesity prevention messages (e.g. portion size snack cups); Training of providers in health communication strategies (use of plain language, supplementing counseling with written inform ation, along with teachback and goal setting); Waiting room program where health educators promote family engagement in care as t hey introduce and support Greenlight messages ; New initiative to enhance reach of Greenlight through technology enhancements . Evidence base From a preliminary analyses of the NIH study, at 4 months, children whose parents received the GREENLIGHT intervention were m ore likely to be breastfeeding (49 vs 38%, p=0.05), less likely to drink juice (5 vs 8%, p=0.02), less likely to receive cereal in the bottle (21 vs 30%, p=0.001), and had less television exposure (p=0.004). Intervention parents were also less likely to make a child finish a bottle (p=0. 004), prop a bottle for feeding (p=0.014), or feed to stop crying (p=0.014). Similar results were seen at 6 -months. The results suggest the intervention positively impacts parent behaviors related to infant feeding and screen time. Future result s will examine the impact of the intervention on these outcomes and weight status through 2 years. [Citations available.] Where intervention will take place Charles B. Wang Community Health Center and the NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers Brooklyn -Chinese site in Sunset Park. Greenlight Process m easures Process measures are gathered for each of the three years, including the following for each year: Provide Greenlight materials to CBWCHC families at well -child visits (2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15- 18m check -ups) o Core booklets o Supp. booklets o Tangible tools (e.g. portion size snack cups) Continue to provide Greenlight materia ls to cohort of enrolled families o Continue assessments at 6, 12 months Conduct training with ~20 current providers (physicians, nursing staff, nutritionists, health educators) on Greenlight pro gram / health literacy (HL) -informed counseling Program re aches 80% of 0 -2 year old children seen at CBWCHC, representing ~450 participants 1000+ booklets Greenlight waiting room program delivered to 50% of eligible children 300 families reached Peer training of new staff Digital Greenlight flipbooks available on line for staff to send to parents and for parents to email share with family members Use of Greenlight booklets tracked via web tools Explore promotion of Greenlight materials via social media networks Partner role Charles B.

Project addresses need of low -income Chinese American families Healthy Families Program/ Programa Familias Saludables Goal Prevent Chronic Disease by reducing obesity in children Outcome o bjectives Intermediate Increase knowledge and awareness of nutrition, physical activity, and o ther healthy lifestyle concepts Improve compliance with 5 -2-1-0 daily guidelines - increase fruit and vegetable consumption (to 5 or more); decreased screen time (to 2 hours or less of recreational screen time); increase activity (to 1 or more hours per day); decrease sugar sweetened beverage consumption (to 0 per day, more water) Stabilize or reduce BMI scores Long -Term Reduce the percentage of children and adolescents who are obese Overview NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers' Healthy Families Program combines preventive programming with research -based interventions designed to equip children to develop healthier behaviors and attitudes around healthy living. The 12-session, multi -disciplinary program for 9- to 11- year -old Hi spanic children with high body- mass index (BMI) scores aims to stabilize or slowly decrease weight (1 pound per month) and BMI scores. We focus on children aged 9 -11, as this is a time when children begin to become independent from their parents and are ab le to evaluate and alter their dietary habits and attitudes. The curriculum is culturally relevant to the local Hispanic population and sessions are conducted in English and Spanish. Eac h session consists of: Nutrition education facilitated by a nutritio nist focusing on the 5 -2-1-0 model in the local and cultural contexts of the participating Healthy Families Program/ Programa Familias Saludables families. Separate support groups for parents and children that address questions, help them adopt strategies for setting limits and pr omoting healthy behaviors, and build peer support. Physical fitness focused on low - or no cost activities that can be done at home or through local community resources, are led by a NYU Lutheran rehabilitation staff, and local businesses (pro -bono), such as martial arts and dance. A p rimary care physician consults on participants' health and makes referrals to social supports and specialists as needed. Evidence base The National Initiative for Children's Healthcare Quality 2007 child and obesity prevention and treatment recommendations were used as a guidelin e. Concepts from the following evidence- based, multi -component programs and curricula were used : Media Smart Youth; We Can! Energize Our Families ; Nutrition to Grow On; and, Eat Healthy, Be Active. New York State Department of Health's Prevention Agenda recommends that parents and caregivers work together to prevent child hood obesity by providing healthy meals and snacks, promoting physical activity, and discussing nutrition that will promote healthy eating behavior. Multi -disciplinary programs that include behavioral counseling, promotion of physical activity, parent training, and dietary counseling provide the most effective treatment for obesity in children and adolescents. Programs that include family members have significant effects on stabilizing or reducing percentage BMI -for-age. Principles from the Shared Medical Appointment (SMA) framework were used to inform the program. SMAs are often multi -disciplinary and family based, include group sessions as well as individual contact with a physician, and often lead to greater patient satisfaction and compliance, and better outcomes. SMAs can be cos t-effective, help patients get answers to questions they would not other ask, create a sense of empowerment, and provide community support. [Citations available.] Where intervention will take place The program currently takes place in Sunset Park, Brooklyn at NYU Lutheran facilities. We plan to expand the program to include school -based health centers and expand from one site to four sites, with two cycles per year at each site. School -based health centers offer medical and mental health services on -site at local schools and offer a unique opportunity to base the program directly where children spend their day. Process m easures Conduct a total of 2 cycles in four sites per year Reach 80 children and families per year Retain 75% of enrolled families for 9 or more sessions Partner Role The program partners with organizations and businesses to support participant recruitment and program implementation (fitness instructors, participant incentives, field trips; etc.). Several partners include: Center for Family Life Sunset Park Martial Arts Young Dancers in Repertory Brooklyn Health Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield Partner r esources Staff time to support recruitment and program implementation. Food and/or material donations for recruitment, program implementation and participant incentives. By w hen Intermediate outcome measures are projected to be achieved by the end of each program cycle Sustained BMI score stabilization or decrease is projected for 1 -year post -program Long -term goal is pro jected to be achieved in/by 2022 Process measures are projected in/by 2019 Will a ction address d isparity ? Yes. The Healthy Families Program/ Programa Familias Saludables addresses racial and income disparities with regard to obesity. There are Healthy Families Program/ Programa Familias Saludables disparities in obesity rates by ethnicity and poverty in New York City. Hispanic and African American residents are disproportionately represented . Two Generations Goal Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children , through a program that seeks to reduce the negative health impact of perinatal depression and adverse childhood events on maternal and child physical and mental health Outcome o bjectives Develop a project model that will: Address maternal stressors, improve maternal mental health, and facilit ate maternal engagement in positive interactions and behaviors with the child; Facilitate positive and responsive parent -child interactions to enhance the parent -child relationship and child outcomes, and simultaneously reduce stress and enhance coping fo r mothers with depressive symptoms; and Transform the coordination of care across the prenatal and pediatric settings through training and supporting staff in the de livery of continuous, comprehensive, and culturally effective care to increase family engagement, deliver more timely and effective screening and interventions, facilitate referral to behavioral care, and enhance maternal and child outcomes. Overview Maternal stressors during the prenatal period increase the risk of pre - and postnatal depression, the likelihood of pregnancy complications and adverse birth outcomes, and decreased responsiveness in the newborn, as well as reduced mother -child interaction s, harsh discipline, lower initiation of breastfeeding, over feeding, and increased Emergency Department visits. Fetal exposure to maternal stres s in pregnancy negatively impacts a child's neuro -development and increases the likelihood of poor health outc omes, such as delays in communication, socioemotional competence, cognitive functioning, behavioral problems, and chronic conditions. These adverse early influence s in turn set the stage for subsequent impaired scholastic achievement, conduct disorder, cr iminal justice system involvement, and a trajectory of disadvantage. In the first year of this Community Service Plan, we will lay the groundwork for implementing a cross -site intervention that would comprehensively implement effective tools to mitigate th ese life -long impacts in perinatal and pediatric care in the NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers and in partnership with NYC Health + Hospitals' Gouverneur Health. In this exploratory phase, we will develo p and refine a program model that will integrate a comprehensive set of evidence- based interventions that cross the birth- line and thus have the potential to simultaneously improve outcomes for two generations. Evidence base The initiative seeks to integrate several evidenced -based programs into a single , comprehensive program: Healthy Steps Starting Early (StEP) Reach Out Stay Strong Essentials (ROSE) STRONG Moms Video Interaction Project [Citation s for evidence base of program components are available.] Where intervention will take place NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers and in partnership with NYC Health + Hospitals' Gouverneur Health Process m easures Model development; additional funding support (pending) Partner r ole Gouverneur Health and NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers are playing key roles i n program development and will design and implement the model.

Housing + Health Goal Prevent Chronic D isease by addressing social determinants of health in affordable housing Outcome o bjectives Intermediate Lifestyle changes (diet/exercise) Increased use of tobacco cessation resources Resolution of apartment/ structural issues Improved coordination of health care and social service s Resident satisfaction with and acceptance of CHW program Increased resident engagement in improving health status and overall well being Improved management of chronic illnesses Reduced utilization of emergency departments Reduced inpatient hospital stays Long -Term Reduced utilization of emergency departments Reduced inpatient hospital stays Improved self- reported health status Improved management of chronic illnesses Improved healthful behaviors Increased self- efficacy Decrease in smoking prevalenc e Reduced costs Overview The Health+Housing Project, a Community Health Worker program to address social, environmental, behavioral, and structural de terminants of health, is being implemented initially in two low -income buildings in CD 3 in partnership w ith Henry Street Settlement, the NYU Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy, the New York City Housing Authority, the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development, Hester Street Collaborative, the Chinatown Y, the Two Bridges Neighborhood Council, and with support from the Robin Hood Foundation. Evidence base Poor health is often concentrated within the same neighborhoods that face concentrated poverty and other social ills. People living in such neighborhoods have high levels of chronic disease, mental illness, and exposure to environmental risks such as injury and violence. Not surprisingly, they concomitantly have high use of costly health care services, including frequent emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Studies have found that CHW interventions can result in improved health outcomes. Published reports suggest that CHW interventions that address multilevel structural and environmental determinants of health, in addition to traditional \"health care\" factors, may be par ticularly effective. As recently noted, there is growing interest in CHW interventions that address upstream factors of health, and current policies and programs in the U.S. are poised to further increase this trend.

This model provides lay workers or resident/ community volunteers the skills to educate and motivate people in the community to address modifiable health risks, like tobacco use, and link community members to evidence based smoking cessation resources. Despite the availab ility of safe and effective treatment for tobacco dependence, only a small proportion of smokers who try to quit each year use cessation therapies. This is particularly true among low -income adults and for non- English language speakers, contributing to gro wing disparities in smoking prevalence. The Community Service Plan navigator program is designed to address this gap. Program also includes a growing group of health care centers and individual providers. Evidence base The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends quitline interventions, particularly proactive quitlines (i.e. those that offer follow -Tobacco Free Community up counseling calls), based on strong evidence of effectiveness in increasing tobacco cessation among clients int erested in quitting. Evidence was considered strong based on findings from 60 trials of proactive telephone counseling when provided alone or in combinatio n with additional interventions.

The progr am empowers an inclusive network of individuals and communities to increase teens' access to culturally -appropriate sexual health information and services. Project SAFE has been providing teen leadership and HIV peer education programming since 1989 at the Project Reach Youth (PRY) site in Brooklyn. Project SAFE trains youth ages 14 - 19 to provide life -saving information to their peers through workshops, performances, and community outreach. Project SAFE provides young people with the support and the oppo rtunities they need to not only avoid risky behaviors, but to develop to their full potential and become agents of change in their communities. The program includes : Multi -session e viden ce-base d sexual health workshop series Peer-led health education groups Community events and single -session workshops Sexual health services designed to meet the unique needs of adolescents prov ided at our Teen Health Clinics. Evidence base 4Me! (part of t he Teen Health Project ) curriculum: culturally appropriate and has been shown to postpone sexual activity and increase condom usage. The Be Proud! Be Responsible! (BPBR) curriculum : aligned with community needs, has been found to be effective with a similar population to our target population, and has a format that is a good fit for both the population and our settings, particularly out of school groups.
