Practice Gap Because hepatitis A, B, and C viruses are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality, clinicians must learn to recognize, treat andprevent infections caused by these viruses. Objectives After completing this article, readers should be able to: 1. Describe the epidemiology of hepatitis A, B, and C virus infections. 2. Recognize the clinical features of hepatitis A infection. 3. Appropriately administer vaccines for the prevention of hepatitis A and B infection. 4. Recognize the various antiviral regimens used for the treatment of hepatitis B and C liver disease. 5. Order the most appropriate tests for the diagnosis of hepatitis virus infections. INTRODUCTION During the past 30 years, the understanding of hepatitis viruses has greatly ex- panded. Knowledge of hepatitis has progressed from merely describing the various clinical syndromes to a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of disease caused by these viruses and the development of chronic infection that eventually leads to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Expanded understand- ing also has led to the development of effective vaccines against hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) and antiviral therapies against hepatitis C virus (HCV). The introduction of routine vaccination against HAV and HBV startingin early childhood in the United States has resulted in a substantial decrease in both of these infections in children and the subsequent complications of HBV- related chronic liver disease. Effective screening of mothers during pregnancy and the administration of HBV vaccine soon after birth, along with administra- tion of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) to infants born to women who have HBV infection, has led to near eradication of perinatally acquired HBV disease in the United States and other countries with effective screening programs. The introduction and routine administration of HAV vaccine in the United States in the 1990s led to near complete elimination of HAV outbreaks among children.AUTHOR DISCLOSURE Drs Christenson and Manaloor have disclosed no nancial relationships relevant to this article.

Newer agents are moreeffective, especially against most genotypes, and cures are frequently observed. In the following review, we summa- rize the clinical manifestations of these viral infections, the various diagnostic assays that clinicians must know how to order and interpret, therapeutic regimens for HBV and HCV infection, and the various measures used to prevent disease. Table 1 provides a quick review of the important clinical aspects for each virus. HEPATITIS A Epidemiology HAV is a Hepatovirus within the Picornaviridae family. It is a nonenveloped, single-stranded RNA virus. HAV is trans- mitted via the fecal-oral route. Person-to-person transmis- sion is observed in most cases, but transmission through the consumption of contaminated food or water and eventransfusions has been documented. Following ingestion, the virus replicates within the gastrointestinal tract, gainingentry into the liver via the portal venous system. Although the virus appears to be noncytopathic to hepatocytes, in flam- mation ensues, although chronic liver disease does not oc- cur. Following the incubation period, a large amount of virus is shed in the stool. The burden of disease throughout the world is greatly influenced by the availability of safe drinking water and uncontaminated food. This i s, in large part, dependent on the quality of the sanitary infrastructure. As a result, resource-poor countries and regions often have a higher burden of infection. The improvement of infrastructure andimplementation of vaccine programs are 2 key factors that have substantially reduced the burden of HAV infection in many countries. In 2005, the World Health Organization estimated that 126 million cases of HAV infection occurred worldwide, resulting in the death of 35,245 persons. (1) Most infections occur in the community, but hospital-acquired TABLE 1.

Vol. 37 No. 10 OCTOBER 2016 427 by guest on March 5, 2019 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from cases of HAV infection have been reported. In many in- stances, infected infants may remain asymptomatic ormildly ill but spread the virus to adults who are known to become much sicker. (2)(3) Outbreaks of HAV infection have been reported in child care centers (4) as well as nursery and primary schools. (5) Food-borne outbreaks of HAV infection were often seen in the United States before implementation of the vaccination program that initially was administered in regions with high disease burden and now is part of the routine childhood immunization schedule. (6)(7) Before the widespread use of HAV vaccination, a dis- proportionate number of cases occurred among Native American populations. The rate of infection in this groupwas at least 20 times higher than that in the non-Hispanic white population. At that time, 11 western states were respon- sible for more than 50% of the cases reported in the United States. Currently, the incidence of HAV infection in the United States is at its lowest. Popula tion-based surveillance col- lected between 2005 and 2007 estimated an annual inci-dence rate of 1.3 cases per 100,000 population (range, 0.7-2.3). (8) Before implementation of vaccination programs, the rate of infection was 14 per 100,000 population. More than 90% ofaffected persons resided in urban areas. Although nearly 50% of all cases occurred in persons ages 15 to 39 years, w20% of c a s e sw e r ea m o n gt h o s ey o u n g e rt h a na g e1 5y e a r s .I n c r e a s e ddisease susceptibility has now shifted to older age groups in whom morbidity and mortality rates are greater. (8) Travel remains a key risk factor for the acquisition of HAV infection. International travel was found to be a risk factor in 45% of reported cases. Contact with a case was a risk factor in w15% of cases. Of interest, 24% of reported cases had been in contact with a traveler but had not travelledthemselves. To minimize this source, vaccination of susceptibleindividuals prior to travel is imperative. (9) Although there is a single HAV serotype, various geno- types and subgenotypes have been identi ed. Subtyping has been found to be useful in outbreak investigations be-cause various HAV genotypes circulate throughout the world. Genotype 1A is responsible for most infections within the United States and mo st of Latin America, whereas 1B is almost exclusively observed in Brazil. Clinical Features HAV infection is a self-limited infection of the liver. Theaverage incubation period is w30 days (range, 15-50 days). Most infections in children ( >70%) are asymptomatic or of mild severity. Asymptomatic infection was observed in 13.6% of children, and subclinical disease was observed in 18.6% of children. Approximately 15% of children with HAV infection have atypical manifestations of the disease.Fever, abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite, and jaundice are common features in the symptomatic child. Symptomatic HAV infection is rarely observed among infants and children younger than age 6 years, with fewer than 10% having jaundice. (10) In those younger than age 3 years, anicteric infection is 17 times more common than icteric infection. In a cohort of 118 children whose mean age was 8.6 years, jaundice was observed in only 48.3%. (11) Cholestasis, acute liver failure, relapsing hepatitis, ascites, and hematologic problems (autoimmune hemolytic ane- mia, anemia, and pure red cell de- scribed. In addition, pleural and pericardial effusion, acute kidney injury (AKI), pancreatitis, and acute reactivearthritis are reported in children and adults. (12) Approxi- mately 80% of adults infected with HAV may develop se- vere hepatitis. (12) HAV does not usually cause chronic disease. However, some children with protracted jaundice have liver histology suggestive of chronic liver disease. (13) Fulminant hepatitis is rare, with a reported incidence of less than 1%. In a study from Pakistan, 56% of children with fulminant hepatic failure had HAV infection compared with 18% who hadHBV infection. (14) Young age, encephalopathy, severe co- agulopathy, and low transaminases are markers of severe disease and poor outcomes. In a study of patients with HAV infection, w8% developed concomitant AKI. (15) In another study, 7% of patients had AKI. (16) Fulminant hepatitis,leukocytosis, and elevated C-reactive protein were indepen- dent markers for risk. A fatal case of encephalitis has been described in an 11-year-old girl presenting with seizures, coma, and anicteric hepatitis. (15)(17) Diagnostic Testing Detection of HAV-speci c antibodies (anti-HAV immuno- globulin [Ig]G and IgM) is the most common method fordiagnosing HAV infections (Table 2). Anti-HAV IgM anti- bodies appear within 5 to 10 days after symptom onset and may persist for up to 4 months. Anti-HAV IgG titers tend to rise later but persist for a longer duration. Most patients with HAV infections develop anti-HAV IgM antibodies at the end of the incubation period ( w4 weeks) and with the onset of symptoms. However, w11% of patients in 1 study had a negative IgM at the time of presentation. Although HAV IgM is the diagnostic test for acute HAV infection,clinicians must keep in mind potential negative results when evaluating children in the early phases of the disease. (19) Treatment There is no available antiviral treatment for HAV. Manage-ment is largely supportive. 428 Pediatrics in Review by guest on March 5, 2019 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from Prevention HAV vaccine is routinely administered to children in the United States as a 2-dose series starting at age 1 year (Table 3). HAV vaccine is also recommended for all susceptibletravelers to countries that have a high prevalence of HAV infection. (20) Some adolescents may require pretravel vac- cination if they have not been vaccinated against HAV. In spite of this recommendation and because of lack of awareness among some older travelers, HAV vaccine is often not received before travel to high-risk areas. Sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia have high endemicity levels and almost no susceptible adolescents and adults because most infections occur early in life. (21) Vaccination rates in adolescents remain low because catch-up vaccination has not been completely implemented. HAV vaccination programs in Native American commu- nities in the United States led to a 20-fold decrease in the number of HAV cases. (22) In Israel, a substantial effect of vaccination was observed in children younger than age 5 years, with a reduction from 239.4 cases per 100,000 in TABLE 2.

(23) HAV infection may lead to decompensation in individuals affected by HBV- or HCV-related liver disease, sometimes resulting in death. (24) HAV vaccine is recommended for all individu- als with chronic liver disease. With the introduction of this vaccine, HAV-related mortality rates in persons with chronic liver disease have decreased dramatically. (20)Individuals at an increased risk of HAV infection in- clude contacts of international ad optees. (25)(26) Nontraveling contacts at home should be vaccinated before the arrival of the adopted child. Even when asymptomatic, infected in- fants and young children can be contagious and transmit virus to susceptible adults.

(29) One percent of children were found to have acute infection (positive IgM). Children born in Africa had the highest prevalence of infection (72%) and children adopted from the Asia/Paci c Rim had the lowest preva- lence (17%). In a systematic review of published studies,the protective effects of HAV vaccine was observed for up to 15 years after vaccination, (30) and a more recent analysis demonstrated a high level of seroprotection for at least 20 to 30 years. (31) Although vaccines are highly effective in preventing HAV infection, the most recent National Immu- nization Survey in 2013 demonstrated that only w50% of children ages 19 to 35 months have received 2 doses of HAV vaccine. (32) Immunocompromised persons should also receive HAV vaccination. Approximately 75% subsequently develop anti- bodies, but the robustness of this response is in fluenced by the degree and type of immunosuppression. Tumor necro-sis factor- ablocker recipients appear to respond better than other individuals, with 92% developing good serologic response. Only 69% of persons receiving regimens con-sisting of methotrexate and az athioprine with or without corticosteroids responded to the vaccine. (33) Because of the variability of immune responses, obtaining an anti- body titer after completion of the vaccine series appears reasonable. Before the licensing of HAV vaccines, protection for sus- ceptible individuals (pre- and postexposure) was achieved through intramuscular administration of human immune globulin (Table 4). Unfortunately, protection was short-lived and only partially protective in some individuals.Travelers expecting prolonged stays in high-risk regionsor individuals expecting prolonged or frequent exposures require readministration every 3 to 5 months. Studies have demonstrated that HAV is immunogenic in infants younger than age 1 year who are born to seronegative mothers. (34)(35)(36) Maternal antibodies appear to blunt the immune response to the vaccine. Although still greater than concentrations considered to be protective, postvaccina- tion antibody values in infants born to seropositive mothers were lower than those in infants born to seronegative moth- ers. (37) HAV vaccine has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children youngerthan age 1 year. Unimmunized and susceptible individuals exposed to HAV and at risk for infection bene tf r o m postexposure HAV vaccination or immune globulin. (38)However, nding immune globulin in the United States has become dif cult. HEPATITIS B Epidemiology HBV is a pro-oncogenic, noncytotoxic, enveloped circular DNA hepadnavirus infrequently responsible for chronic infection in developed countries. (39) The prevalence of chronic HBV infection has decreased in several regions of the world, especially in central sub-Saharan Africa, tropical and central Latin America, southeast Africa, and central Europe. (40) The routine use of HBV vaccination at birth and in early childhood in Native American communities resulted in a substantial decrease in acute symptomatic TABLE 4.

Vol. 37 No. 10 OCTOBER 2016 431 by guest on March 5, 2019 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from HBV infections from 200 per 100,000 persons in 1981 to less than 5 per 100,000 in 1996. (22) Among those withchronic hepatitis B disease (CHB) in developed countries, as many as 2% were infected as a consequence of being unimmunized and via a behavioral exposure outside of the pediatric age range. Globally, more than 350 million people are infected with HBV, the vast majority of whom acquired the infection in the perinatal period and during early childhood. Mother-to-child transmission is responsible for at least one-third of all CHB disease worldwide. (41) The risk of perinatal infection is greatest (90%) when a mother be- comes acutely infected during the third trimester anddemonstrates antigenemia with both HBV surface anti- gen (HBsAg) and HBV envelope antigen (HBeAg), with HBeAg being a marker for higher infectivity. Approximately 65% of children born to HBeAg-positive mothers develop chronic infection compared to only w28% of those born to HBeAg-negative mothers. (42) Not surprisingly, the riskof infection is related to the magnitude of endemicity. In addition, not surprisingly, mothers with high HBV DNA values and who deliver vaginally are more likely to in-fect their infants at birth. (43) Progress to CHB is related to the timing of acute infection, with the greatest risk (90%) conferred on those infected before their rst birthdays. The risk of CHB declines substantially with age, peaking at 50%of those infected between ages 1 and 5 years and 1 in 10 of those infected thereafter. According to a recent study, peri- natally acquired HBV infection was documented in 1% of infants for whom HBsAg test results were available. Nearly 95% of these infants had received HBV vaccine and HBIG within 12 hours of birth. (44) Younger maternal age, HBeAg positivity, high maternal viral load ( 2,000 IU/mL), and infant receipt of fewer than 3 HBV vaccines were associated with increased risk of infection. Children infected perinatally are infectious for years, but despite often profound vire- mia, they do not exhibit clinical disease, having only mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase values and living as immune-tolerant patients as they transition to states of immune-active/clearance or inactive carrier. Persons who are HBsAg-positive are at risk of HBV reactivation if they receive any type of immunosuppressive therapy. Forty per-cent of persons receiving immunosuppressive therapy reactivate HBV, with liver failure developing in 13% and a case-fatality of 16%. (45) Clinical Features Acute HBV infections can be asymptomatic or symptom-atic. Older children, adolescents, and adults are more likely to have symptomatic disease, with 30% to 50% of childrenolder than age 5 years exhibiting symptoms. Nonspeci c symptoms such as nausea, malaise, fever, and fatigue may be present. Acute disease, characterized by jaundice, decreased appetite, and emesis, presents after viremia and HBsAg antigenemia have peaked. Fulminant hepatitis can also be observed. Extrahepatic manifestations of thrombocytopenia, glomerulonephritis, and Gianotti-Crosti syndrome, may be present with acute infection. Some 95% of mother-to-child transmissions occur during the intrapartum period, with the remainder occur- ring in utero. Most infected infants lack symptoms. Between 15% and 40% of children who have CHB infection developcirrhosis and/or hepatic carcinoma, and 25% of those chil- dren die from these complications. (41) Viral replication, inflammation, regeneration, and brosis associated with cirrhosis are virologic and histopathologic features of chronicinfection. Although the precise mechanism by which HBV causes hepatocellular carcinoma is not completely known, a direct oncogenic effect by the virus is suspected. (46) Diagnostic Testing The interpretation of diagnostic tests for HBV infection canbe challenging. The usual diagno stic serology should include IgG antibody against hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAb), IgM antibody against hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb), and HBsAg. Based on these results, clinicians can determine if the child is immune to HBV, has active HBV infection, is in the \"window period\" for HBV infection, or is immune following vaccination (Table 2, Figs 1 and 2). The \"window period \"is dened as the time from the onset of infection to the development of serologic evidence of infection. Thediagnosis of HBV infection is made by serum detection ofHBsAg. Antigenemia persists in carriers, but integrated viral genome can reactivate in certain circumstances. Hepatitis B surface antibodies result from infection and vaccination, but hepatitis B core IgG antibody can only result from infection and not vaccination because the vaccine lacks the core anti- gen. (47) Among those who clear the infection, HBsAg is no longer detectable after 6 months. It is important to remember that vaccination may lead to the detection of antigenemia. (48)(49)(50) The antibody against HBsAg is neutralizing and confers lifelong immunity. The pres- ence of IgG antibodies agains t hepatitis B core antigen is indicative of a current or past infection. Vaccination does not lead to a positive HBcAb. Treatment Acute infections can be managed supportively. Treatment ofCHB is reserved for the subset of patients in immune-active 432 Pediatrics in Review by guest on March 5, 2019 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from states. Antiviral therapy is not indicated for the person in the immune-tolerant or inactive phase of the disease. (51) Ther- apy is complicated by the potential for resistance. Therefore, combination therapy should be used. Patients with CHB may develop cirrhosis and a minority may develop cancer. Consequently, these patients should undergo annual ultra- sonography and a-fetoprotein screening to monitor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therapy is rarely indicated during childhood, but there is contro- versy about such treatment. (52) Only an estimated 3% to 5% of chronic carriers develop cirrhosis and 0.01% to 0.03%develop HCC before adulthood. (such as tenofovir, lamivudine, entecavir, and telbivudine) have been used in persons who meet criteria for initiation of therapy. (53) Chronically infected children who acquired their infection perinatally rarely (10%) clear HBV infection with interferon- a. Newer therapies using drugs derived from human immunode ciency virus (HIV) care, such as lamivudine, emtricitabine, tenofovir, and adefovir,some of which are administered in combination, are used in treatment of CHB. Infected patients should be screened for coinfection with HCV and hepatitis D virus as well as HIV. Figure 2.

(54) Prevention Screening all pregnant women at the rst prenatal visit captures nearly all infected mothers. However, supplemen-tal testing during the third trimester or at the time of delivery is warranted in some women. This is especially important if mothers report additional risk factors, such as injection drug use, having been incarcerated, being a house- hold or sexual contact of a person known to have HBV infection, being from a country with greater than 2% ende- micity, or having parents from a country with greater than8% endemicity. Neonates born to HbsAg-positive mothers should be given both passive and active immunization within 12 hours of birth using HBIG and HBV vaccine (Tables 3 and 4). This combination mitigates against ver- tical transmission for 85% to 95% of infants who are appro- priately treated. (55) The course of routine active vaccination against HBV is not altered among these newborns, who should receive 3 doses by age 6 months, with the second dose provided at age 2 months. All other newborns should receive the rst dose of the HBV vaccine series before hospital discharge. Screening of exposed infants is best undertaken after age 18 months, once maternal antibodies and immunoglobulin have cleared. (56) Although virus is detectable in the milk of lactating moth- ers, breastfeeding is not contraindicated as long as the child has received appropriate prophylaxis. All children, but especially those with CHB, should be vaccinated against HAV (Table 3). HEPATITIS C Epidemiology Like HBV, HCV is enveloped, pro-oncogenic, and noncyto- toxic and is most commonly transmitted via exposure to contaminated blood. As a flavivirus, HCV has a genome composed of a single-stranded positive-sense RNA mole-cule. HCV has 6 distinct genotypes, and mutations generate quasispecies, both of which in fluence overall response to specic therapy as well as the patient' s clinical presentation. Genotype 3 infection is most likely to progress to brosis. Unlike HBV, mother-to-child transmission of HCV is extremely uncommon, approaching 5% among the singly infected and reaching w10% among mothers coinfected with HIV. In developed countries, 1% to 2% of mothers areinfected with HCV. Globally, however, some 150 million individuals are infected. Among those infected perina- tally with HCV, nearly 80% progress to chronic infection,although most are asymptomatic. (39) For patients infected with either HBV or HCV, progression to liver disease isgreatly accelerated by the consumption of alcohol. Accord- ingly, abstinence is most appropriate. Risk factors for acquiring these viruses are similar. Speci cally, patients requiring hemodialysis, those who have received a tattoofrom an unregulated venue, those who have received an intravenous blood product before July 1992, recreational intravenous and/or nasal drug users, and men who have sex with men are at increased risk for acquiring HCV (Table 1). Diagnostic Testing The detection of anti-HCV IgG antibodies is the primary diagnostic method for acute and past HCV infection (Table 2). As for many other infections that can be potentially acquired during pregnancy, the presence of IgG antibodies in young infants born to mothers known to have HCV isnot diagnostic because of the presence of transplacentally acquired antibodies. In HCV-exposed infants, clinicians must wait at least until age 18 months before the assay can be useful as a diagnostic test. In young infants in whom it is important to determine the presence of infection, a nucleic acid ampli cation test (NAAT) such as polymerase chain reaction assay is necessary. No antiviral therapy is indicated pending con rmation of infection. Rapid diagnostic antibody tests are highly accurate, with high sensitivity and speci city. (57)(58) Although newer anti- body detection assays have greater sensitivity and speci city, a large number of HCV-infected persons may experience a win- dow period in which antibody assay results may be false- negative. Within 3 months of exposure, most infected persons have a positive antibody test. NA AT is used to detect the presence of viremia, to help predict clinical outcomes and need forantiviral therapy, and to determine response to therapy. Infants born to mothers with HCV infection should be evaluated at age 18 months via both antibody and RNA screening. RNA screening could be undertaken as early asage 2 months, but some who have positive results still clear the infection spontaneously. As with HBV, those infected with HCV in whom therapy is deferred should receive annual serial screening with a-fetoprotein and ultrasonog- raphy to monitor progression of brosis and development of HCC. Patients who have HCV infection must have immu- nity against HAV and HBV con rmed and should receive active immunization if not previously vaccinated (Table 3). Treatment The development of effective antiviral regimens for the treatment of chronic HCV infection (CHC) has been a 434 Pediatrics in Review by guest on March 5, 2019 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from major advance in the elds of hepatology and infectious diseases. Although data on their use in young children are limited, ongoing studies in adolescents and young adults should yield information on which regimens are safer and more effective for use in children with CHC. Perhaps in the near future, therapy can be initiated earlier in the infection before advanced liver disease develops. Historically, use of pegylated interferon- aand ribavirin therapy was limited both by sustained virologic response and adverse effectprole. (56) This combination was only w50% effective in children and adolescents with HCV genotype 1 infection,the most common genotype in the United States. The regimen was more effective in persons with genotype 2and 3 infections. However, treatment was usually initiated once the person had developed advanced disease. Adverse effects with interferon were not uncommon. Infl uenzalike symptoms, leukopenia, and anemia could limit completionof antivirals (DAAs), such telaprevir, dasabuvir, are in combination. DAAs target viral protease, polymerase, and NS5A protein necessary for replication and assembly of new viruses. Instudies performed in adults, cure was achieved in nearly all patients, whether they had treatment-na\u00efve or refractory CHC, in as few as 12 weeks of therapy based on genotype distinctions. (59) Cure rates of greater than 90% can now be achieved with interferon-free combinations. Various com- binations are undergoing clinical trials in children ages 3 to 17 years. The combination of ombitasvir, paritaprevir/ ritonavir, and ribavirin is undergoing trials against genotype 4 HCV, while this combination plus dasabuvir is being studied against genotype 1 disease. (56) Infection is more dif cult to manage among those co- infected with different HCV genotypes or with HBV or HIV.Therapy should be directed by hepatology and infectious diseases specialists because patients should be considered for ongoing trials of these newer agents given the adult outcomes to date. New antiviral treatments for HCV con- sisting of protease inhibitors, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin have demonstrated increased quality-adjusted life-years and re- duced deaths in adults. Although cost-effectiveness per per- son treated is noticeable, the demand for these newertherapies may pose a major nancial burden to the health care system as these agents become available. (60) The availability of safe, effective, and less expensive an- tiviral regimens has the potential to reduce the incidence,morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures associ- ated with HCV. Such availability also may serve to trigger routine prenatal screening to identify infected mothers and potentially lead to early treatment of mother and infant toprevent CHC. (56) In addition, these agents could be used following an occupational exposure as a strategy to preventinfection. Prevention Recognition and prompt treatment of infected individuals(especially mothers) can prevent the transmission of HCV to young infants. Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advocated screening all individuals born between 1945 and 1965, regardless of the absence of risk factors. (61) Patients with ongoing risk should be screened annually with an antibody test (anti-HCV) and if positive, with con rmatory testing with a quantitative RNA viral load. When HCV is detected, genotype screening is important because therapy can be optimized, if indicated. At this time there is no vaccine against HCV. Furthermore, because perinatal interventions such as elective cesarean section or abstaining from breastfeeding do not appear to diminish vertical transmission and because vertical transmission is most likely to occur in the presence of maternal viremia, infection appears to occur in utero. Nevertheless, mothers should be advised to forgo breastfeeding if their nipples are cracked or bleeding. (59) OTHER HEPATITIS VIRUSES HAV, HBV, and HCV have been recognized as pathogens ofgreat importance in the United States and throughout the world. In recent years, other viruses have gained recognition as causes of acute hepatitis and jaundice. Without going into great detail, hepatitis E and D viruses deserve special mention. Hepatitis E virus (HEV), transmitted by the fecal-oral route, is recognized as a major cause of morbidity andmortality, especially in pregnant women and immunocom- promised hosts. In some regions of the world, HEV may the most common cause of acute hepatitis. (62) HEV is a small, nonenveloped RNA virus within the newly formed Herpes- viridae family. Four genotypes have been identi ed, and genotypes 1 and 2 have been associated with epidemichepatitis outbreaks after contact with contaminated water. Genotypes 3 and 4 are mostly zoonotic and emerge after contact with domestic and wild pigs. Humans are usually infected after close contact with swine. Infections with HEVare still uncommon in the United States. However, travel to endemic areas poses a risk for acquisition. (63) Clinical features of the disease are similar to those of HAV infection. Chronic infection is usually not the norm in the previ- ously healthy person, but severe disease and death is well described in infected pregnant women and older adults. Vol. 37 No. 10 OCTOBER 2016 435 by guest on March 5, 2019 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from Chronic disease has been described in immunocompro- mised individuals. Antiviral therapy consisting of pegylatedinterferon- aand ribavirin or ribavirin monotherapy has been used to treat persons with chronic infection. (64)(65)The precise ef cacy of this regimen is still unknown, with most of the data resulting from case reports and smallstudies. An effective HEV vaccine has been produced in China. (66) Hepatitis D virus (HDV) causes infection in persons infected with HBV. HDV requires HBV for replication and cannot produce infection in its absence. HDV is dis- tributed worldwide. It can infect the person acutely as a coinfection with acute HBV or in someone who has achronic HBV infection. The clinical presentation of infec- tion resembles that of HBV, but it may contribute to a more severe presentation aggravat ed by fulminant hepatitis. Transmission is similar to that for HBV, with most infec-tions resulting from exposure to contaminated body fluids such as blood or blood products, through intravenous druguse, or via sexual contact. The prevention of HBV through vaccination prevents HDV infection.References and CME quiz for this article are at http://pedsinre-view.aappublications.org/content/37/10/426. Summary On the basis of strong epidemiologic evidence, hepatitis viruses are responsible for signi cant morbidity and mortality in young infants and children throughout the world. (1)(22)(33) On the basis of research evidence, hepatitis A and B vaccines are effective in preventing disease. Furthermore, data strongly demonstrate that hepatitis A and B vaccines are safe in younginfants and children. (23)(24)(26)(34) On the basis of strong evidence, pregnant mothers should be screened and concomitant active and passive immunization against hepatitis B should be provided to newborns as a strategyto prevent chronic hepatitis B in children. (44)(47) On the basis of new research, the use of antiviral agents is bene cial in the treatment of and potential clearance of chronic infections caused by hepatitis B and C viruses.
