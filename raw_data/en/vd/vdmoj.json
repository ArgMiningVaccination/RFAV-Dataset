About two years ago I decided to dedicate my life to improving the way digestive health conditions are diagnosed, monitored, and treated. Today I'm joined by a group of patients, doctors, and researchers dedicated to the goal of saving humanity from the inside out. As a passionate intestinal health researcher, I'm here to share knowledge on gastrointestinal physiology, the brain-gut axis, digital health, artificial intelligence for medicine, [Injoy](https://www.injoy.bio) (my startup), and more. I can't wait to answer your questions and address many of the inquiries I've received chatting with you all across different subreddits! Proof: EDIT: WOW this was incredible. Really did not expect this to blow up the way it did. Thank you to everyone for taking the time to ask us such excellent questions. I might just need to make a habit out of this. See you all next time :) Feel free to send me a message on [Injoy](https://www.injoy.bio/)'s "}
