Math Biosci ; 360: 108981, covidwho-2245587 ABSTRACTThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on [health systems]and economies across the globe. Implementing [public health] [measures]in tandem with effective [vaccination] [strategies]have been instrumental in curtailing the burden of the [pandemic]. With the three [vaccines]authorized for use in the U.S. having varying efficacies and waning effects against major COVID-19 [strains], [understanding]the impact of these [vaccines]on COVID-19 [incidence]and fatalities is critical. Here, we formulate and use [mathematical models]to assess the impact of [vaccine]type, [vaccination]and booster uptake, and waning of natural and [vaccine]-induced [immunity]on the [incidence]and fatalities of COVID-19 and to predict [future] [trends]of the [disease]in the U.S. when existing control [measures]are reinforced or relaxed. The results show a 5-fold reduction in the control [reproduction]number during the initial [vaccination]period and a 1.8-fold (2-fold) reduction in the control [reproduction]number during the initial first booster (second booster) uptake period, compared to the respective previous periods. Due to waning of [vaccine]-induced [immunity], vaccinating up to 96% of the U.S. [population]might be required to attain [herd immunity], if booster uptake is low. Additionally, vaccinating and boosting more people from the onset of [vaccination]and booster uptake, especially with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna [vaccines](which confer superior [protection]than the Johnson & Johnson [vaccine]) would have led to a significant reduction in COVID-19 cases and deaths in the U.S. Furthermore, adopting [natural immunity]-boosting [measures]is important in fighting COVID-19 and [transmission]rate reduction [measures]such as [mask]-use are critical in combating COVID-19. The emergence of a more transmissible COVID-19 variant, or early [relaxation]of existing control [measures]can [lead]to a more devastating [wave], especially if [transmission]rate reduction [measures]and [vaccination]are relaxed simultaneously, while chances of containing the [pandemic]are enhanced if both [vaccination]and [transmission]rate reduction [measures]are reinforced simultaneously. We conclude that maintaining or improving existing control [measures], and boosting with [mRNA vaccines]are critical in curtailing the burden of "}
