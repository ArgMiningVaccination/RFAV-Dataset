Sensory input (or percept) is defined as that which we join with concepts, gained through thinking intuition, in order for full cognition to arise. How is it possible to perceive a thought before thinking? Detlef Hardorp explores this mystery, including a fascinating description of the one instance in which we gain concepts directly from other human beings without needing intuitions to facilitate the acquisition of these concepts. His extended essay offers a significant contribution to the study of the senses and will be of special interest to high school teachers working with the higher, cognitive senses. A trio of articles explores issues related to health and wellbeing. Philip Incao contemplates the role of warmth in allowing the human being\u00d5s spiritual essence to take hold of healing processes. He describes a historical progression that has led to a significant decrease in \u00d2warm\u00d3 (fever-inducing, acute, usually infectious) diseases and childhood mortality, but that, having swung the pendulum too far in the other direction, has led to the rise of \u00d2cold\u00d3 (and chronic) conditions such as ADD and asthma. One is left with renewed appreciation for the crucial importance of warmth not only as a physical process but as a pedagogical and social principle as well. Sue Gerhardt writes about brain development during infancy. The studies she describes show from a scientific perspective what good parents and care givers have long sensed: Calm and loving care is not just a \u00d2nice\u00d3 but a critically important factor for the development of the neurological networks that shape behavior later in life. She adds scientific rigor to the importance of the \u00d2only real healing force.\u00d3 Christof Wiechert describes what research has identified as five key areas in the development of resilience in children. It is clear that Waldorf education has been doing much to support resilience, and the research supports essential aspects of Steiner\u00d5s approach. Though many teachers may be doing the right thing as a matter of course, the more fully conscious we are of the consequences of our work, the more likely we are to do it with conviction and joy. There is a short article by Sebastian Suggate, who has done empirical research in New Zealand concerning the difference (or none thereof) in reading competence among children who began reading instruction before age 7 or after. He describes conclusive evidence that there is absolutely no measurable difference in ability by age 12. This is the kind of scientific research that can help allay the fears of parents in Waldorf schools that their children are \u00d2falling behind.\u00d3 Michaela Glckler, a frequent and much- appreciated contributor to the Research Bulletin, offers a meditation on the structure and purpose of the Medical Section. As few can, she illuminates the profound spiritual archetypes underlying the structure of the organization she has been leading for the past two decades. Anyone involved in the governance of an anthroposophical institution is warmly encouraged to read this piece. A short description of work with the circle-and-point meditation, written by Rudiger Grimm, a long-time remedial teacher, concludes Dr. Glckler\u00d5s article. Arthur Zajonc is another of the Research Bulletin's stalwarts. In an article reprinted from his most recent book, The Heart of Higher Education: A Call to Renewal, he offers a comprehensive, integrated, and holistic approach to adult education.

Dorit Winter writes a review of The Age of Wonder by Richard Holmes. With her customary precision and insight, she describes an author who, through impeccable research, arrives at profound experiences of his own consciousness, as well as the consciousness of his subjects. As would befit an educator of teachers, Dorit also offers practical application of the material from the book for different grade levels.

This collection will be of special interest to researchers and other individuals seeking to gain access and download books for research and study. Through the generosity of the Waldorf Curriculum Fund we have, since November 2010, produced 23 additional electronic books. T ogether with the 30 e-Books already produced, this represents a significant treasure trove of research material available at our Online Waldorf Library (OWL), www.waldorflibrary.org. This web-based resource is accessible free of charge, and we encourage you to visit it frequently. Our online librarian\u00d5s regular report of activities appears separately towards the end of this issue. As Co-Directors we have continued to meet, correspond, and collaborate with the leadership of the Pdagogische Forschungsstelle in Stuttgart and the Alanus University in Alfter, outside of Bonn, Germany, as well as research colleagues in Australia and New Zealand. Due to financial constraints we are unable to expand these efforts into a larger scale. In collaboration with our colleagues at the Pdagogische Forschungsstelle in Kassel, Germany, the Research Institute has produced a book Topics in Mathematics for the Waldorf High School: 11th Grade. The English-language edition of this book is available via AWSNA Publications at www. whywaldorfworks.org. This year\u00d5s course on \u00d2T eaching Sensible Science\u00d3 got off to a roaring start at the Chicago Waldorf School with 27 participants\u00d1the largest group thus far. See Lylli Anthon\u00d5s report in this Research Bulletin for more details. For more information on this popular course, which over the years has been offered in Waldorf schools across the U.S., please contact Michael D\u00d5Aleo at spalight@ verizon.net. We are grateful to the Leadership T eam at AWSNA and to the Waldorf Educational Foundation for sponsoring this program, which allows class teachers to deepen their understanding and practice of phenomenological observation in the context of the Waldorf science curriculum in grades 6\u00d08. Work is progressing on the sexual education curriculum and book for grades 4\u00d012 under the guidance of Douglas Gerwin, Director of the Center for Anthroposophy and Co-Director of the Research Institute. Translation of a recently published collection of essays on this subject from German to English has been completed, and several Waldorf high school teachers, as well as professional counselors in this field, are collaborating with Douglas to formulate guidelines for an English- language curriculum to address not only physical and psychological but also the spiritual dimensions of this subject. On behalf of the Research Institute and the readers of the Research Bulletin, we would like to express our gratitude to Stephen Sagarin, editor of our twice-yearly journal who relinquished his position at the Bulletin last summer after five years of dedicated service in order to give his full attention\u00d1apart from his duties as chair of the Great Barrington Waldorf High School\u00d1to the deadline of his forthcoming book for SteinerBooks on Waldorf education. We had a good deal of joy working together with Stephen. His wry humor and provocative thinking\u00d1along with fluent style and chiseled editorial pen\u00d1brought added clarity and freshness to the Bulletin. We wish him well WReport from the Co-Directors6 From the Co-Directors Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1and treasure his lasting colleagueship. Stephen has agreed to remain as Research Fellow and occasional contributor of articles to the Bulletin. With this edition we are delighted to introduce Elan Leibner as our new editor. For many years a class teacher at the Waldorf School of Princeton, New Jersey, Elan recently spent a year leading the \u00d2education course\u00d3 at Emerson College in Forest Row, Great Britain. At present he is an active member of the Pedagogical Section Council and serves as teacher educator and consultant to Waldorf schools across North America. Elan, who hails from Israel, is a world traveler who prepared portions of this issue of the Bulletin in cafes as distant from each other as Seattle in the Pacific Northwest and T uscany in Northern Italy.

David Mitchell Douglas Gerwin Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1T ending the Flame: The Link Between Education and Medicine in Childhood Philip Incao The Tragedy of Hospitalism I once had a medical consultation with an eight- year-old Waldorf student who had been adopted by her American mother from a Romanian orphanage. The mother recounted to me the intensely moving story of their first encounter. She entered a room full of children and her eyes rested on a tiny waif in a crib who looked to be about eight months old, with no teeth and as yet unable to stand or talk. Their eyes met, the child laughed, and in that moment the mother knew that \u00d2this was my child.\u00d3 Then to her shock she learned that the child was over two years old! \u00d2I just took her home and loved her,\u00d3 she told me, \u00d2and all her teeth started coming in and she began standing, walking, and talking!\u00d3 What an amazing demonstration of the power of human caring, of human warmth, and of the human spirit itself, I thought at the time. I\u00d5ve since learned more fully that this was by no means an isolated example. In the early 1900s, children in American orphanages and hospitals died at a staggering rate of a mysterious condition that came to be called hospitalism: \u00d2a listless wasting away despite adequate food, a weakening of muscles, loss of reflexes, and greatly increased risk of gastrointestinal and lung infections. For older children, it might take days or weeks for hospitalism to set in, but if they left the hospital they improved drastically within days.\u00d3 1 The experts of the day could not understand why these children were dying in great numbers, but exposure to hospital germs was the prime suspect. So children were further isolated from human contact and kept alone in disinfected hospital cubicles designed to be a barrier to germs \u00d0\u00d0and their death rate grew still higher. Hospitalism lay at the intersection of two ideas popular at the time: a worship of sterile, aseptic conditions at all costs and a belief among the pediatric establishment that touching, holding, and nurturing infants was sentimental maternal foolishness. 2 The lethal agent in hospitalism was no germ, but simply the fact that, in addition to being isolated and treated coolly by the hospital staff, children were allowed parental visits for only People are social creatures; just try to remember we need human contact and warmth more than any thing. \u00d0 Colorado eighth-grader Kelly Ash, reflecting on the Columbine tragedy. Education is to light a fire, not to fill a bucket. \u00d0 Heraclitus A social issue is essentially an educational issue and this in turn is essentially a medical issue, but only if medicine is fertilized with spiritual knowledge. \u00d0 Rudolf Steiner Fever is the purifying flame which renews the body. \u00d0 Hippocrates8 Tending the Flame Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1two or three hours per week. It wasn\u00d5t until 1942 that emotional deprivation and loneliness were acknowledged to be the true causes of hospitalism. Isn\u00d5t it interesting (and tragic) how an idea that seems self-evident today\u00d1that infants and children need warm and loving human contact in order to survive, grow, and develop properly\u00d1took so long to be understood and accepted? But that is the usual way human knowledge advances. As Schopenhauer observed, \u00d2All truth goes through three stages. First it is ridiculed. Then it is violently opposed. Finally, it is accepted as self-evident.\u00d3 A Search for Solid Ground The forgotten shameful story of hospitalism still has important lessons to teach. In the early 1900s it was an article of faith among physicians that human consciousness and human emotions could have no influence whatsoever on the inner workings of the human physical body. How could they? They are only subjective and non-material. They exist only in the mind, quite apart from our physical body. Or so we imagined. It is reassuring to find solid ground in our scientific seeking to understand the human being, and for the past 300 to 500 years that solid ground has been the human physical body. Medicine still operates on the assumption that the inner workings of the body are pretty much the same in everyone. When these workings run smoothly we have health, and when they malfunction we have illness. Medicine is based on this assumption and so is popular thinking about health. Illness is a problem of bodily malfunction on the physical level, end of story. In this respect, things haven\u00d5t changed much since the days of hospitalism. Perhaps we no longer consider children\u00d5s need for human warmth and loving human contact to be sentimental foolishness, but we are still a long way from understanding the inner needs of children. Mainstream medicine and education are still based on the unproven and unjustifiable assumption, really a bias, that human feelings have little or nothing to do with the health of the physical body. The Canary in the Coal Mine Like the canary in the coal mine, today\u00d5s child is in distress. A look at the statistics confirms this. The crudest measure of children\u00d5s health is their death rate from all causes. In the 1950s American children had one of the lowest death rates in the world. According to UNICEF statistics for 2006, there are now thirty-eight nations where children under five years old have a lower death rate than the rate recorded in the U.S. This under-five death rate, which UNICEF names on their website \u00d2a critical indicator of the well-being of children,\u00d3 shows that, compared with children in other developed nations, the well-being of U.S. children has been declining since the 1960s. Now children under five years old in all of Western Europe, as well as in Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Croatia, and Cuba, have lower death rates than do U.S. children. What are American children dying from? In 1900 most of the deaths in our children were due to inflammatory conditions such as pneumonia, diarrhea, TB, measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, and scarlet fever. Deaths from acute inflammatory contagious conditions declined in the 20th century with improvements in the standard of living, sanitation, and literacy in the U.S. and other developed nations. 3,4,5 By the early 1950s most of the acute inflammatory conditions listed above were less common and far less serious in American children. Sulfa drugs, as well as vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough, had been developed before World War II and were now starting to be put into more widespread use along with the new The question at the core of this article is, \u00d2What is health, and why has it changed so dramatically in our children in the last hundred years?\u00d3 Philip Incao 9 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1wonder drug, penicillin. Polio, the dreaded scourge of the 1940s and 1950s, fairly soon fell into decline with the advent of the Salk and then later the Sabin polio vaccines. The 1950s, the Eisenhower years, were a time of post-war optimism and prosperity, and also for American children a time of relative good health. We had reached a balance point: The old acute scourges of pneumonia, typhoid, diphtheria, etc., had largely retreated and the new chronic scourges of allergies, asthma, diabetes, and cancer were still relatively rare in children. Practically unknown in those early post-war years were the now common conditions of autism, learning disabilities, hyperactivity, and attention- deficit disorder. Also largely unknown was the modern tragedy of homicide, suicide, and drug use among children. A Great Shift in Health There has been a dramatic shift in all modern industrialized nations: Children no longer die from acute inflammations as much as they suffer from a variety of chronic conditions affecting their immune system (allergies, asthma, diabetes), their neurological system (autism, learning and developmental disabilities), and their behavioral and emotional stability (depression, suicide, violence, and drug use). It is reasonable to assume there is a spectrum of causes that contributes to these conditions, in specific and non-specific ways, some acknowledged and many as yet unknown or unacknowledged. One of the acknowledged non-specific causes which contributes to stress and distress in today\u00d5s children is the decline of stability in the American family. According to a 1994 Carnegie report on U.S. children, the percent of children under the age of three living with one parent increased almost fourfold from 1960 to 1990, from 7% to 27%. There are also a number of possible specific causes just now being debated across the country, including vaccine reactions as a cause of diabetes, autism, and asthma; excessive antibiotic use as a cause of allergies and asthma; excessive T.V . and computer use as a cause of behavioral dysfunction in young children; and exposure to fluoride in water and to mercury and aluminum in vaccines as possible causes of neurological dysfunction. My purpose in this article is not to debate specific causes, as valid as that debate may be, but to point to the overall trend and to characterize it in such a way as to shed light on the problems children are experiencing today. I\u00d5ve already sketched the overall trend in the U.S. and other developed nations since 1900, but a summary is needed: 1. Children are dying at a lower rate than ever before. 2. Illness and death from acute contagious inflammatory diseases occur at a lower rate in children than ever before. This fact alone is responsible for #1 above. 3. Children have more chronic conditions and more disabling conditions than ever before. The Medical Tribune of August 13, 1998, reported a study that estimated 18% of U.S. children suffered a chronic health or behavioral problem which qualified them for special services supported by public programs. 6 That\u00d5s almost one in five children. The July 5, 2002, edition of the Washington Post reported: \u00d2One of every dozen U.S. children and teenagers [ages 5-20]\u00d15.2 million\u00d1has a physical or mental disability, according to new figures from the 2000 census that reflect sharp growth in the nation\u00d5s young handicapped population over the past decade\u00d1[in which] special-education enrollment rose twice as fast as overall school enrollment.\u00d3 4. While certain social conditions like poverty, hygiene, and sanitation have improved, others like family stability, child abuse, violence, and drug use have worsened. 7 A survey by the Public Health Policy Advisory Board found that of all children between the ages of one and nineteen who died in 1995, 41% died from accidents or unintentional injuries, many of them 10 Tending the Flame Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1alcohol or drug related, a shocking 14% died from homicide, 7% from suicide, 7% from cancer, 5% from birth defects, and 1% from infections. 8 Although the overall death rate of children has declined very dramatically in all developed nations since 1900, it bears repeating that U.S. children under five years old are still dying at a higher rate today than children in thirty-eight other countries, probably largely due to the worsening social conditions mentioned under #4 above. In 1995, homicides in the U.S. were the fourth leading cause of death in children one to nine years old, the third leading cause in children ten to fourteen years old, and the second leading cause in adolescents fifteen to nineteen years old. 9 In a report entitled \u00d2A Call to Action,\u00d3 the blue ribbon Public Health Policy Advisory Board concluded: \u00d2The most important threats to American children today lurk in the changing psychosocial fabric of American society and in behavioral and cultural changes not readily amenable to definition by the biomedical models that empowered public health earlier in this century.\u00d3 10 A New Paradigm Needed The message is clear: A new way of thinking and new models are needed, not just for social problems but for education, health, and medicine as well. In a prophetic lecture entitled \u00d2Health Care as a Social Issue\u00d3 given in 1920 and cited at the beginning of this article, Rudolf Steiner speaks to this need. Steiner\u00d5s mission was to bring much-needed healing into human culture and social life. Essential to his mission was the renewal of contemporary medical science and education through the application of a new model of human biology and human psychology. Steiner\u00d5s model\u00d1simple in outline (though complex in the details)\u00d1represented a renewal of ancient Western and Eastern wisdom, viz. the human being is composed of four concrete realities: spirit, consciousness (soul), life, and body. Only the last, the physical body, is concrete in the material sense, that is, perceptible to our senses and to our scientific instruments. The other three elements of the human being\u00d0\u00d0spirit, soul, and life\u00d0\u00d0are wholly invisible and non-material, but without them the wonderful human physical body would be nothing but a cold, lifeless corpse prone to deterioration and decay. Thus, spirit, soul, and life are not abstract or vague, but are concrete realities graspable by the human mind and having definite functions and observable effects in the human physical body. As soon as one begins to study the human being in light of this fourfold model of spirit, soul, life, and body, some helpful answers to very basic questions start to emerge. The question at the core of this article is, \u00d2What is health, and why has it changed so dramatically in our children in the last hundred years?\u00d3 Based on Steiner\u00d5s fourfold model, we could answer this question as follows: Health is the harmonious balance in the rhythmical workings of spirit, soul, life, and body in us, a household in which our spirit should rule, and not another member of our being. Again, this is a simple answer in outline, but very complex in the concrete details. As to the important question, what is healthy development through childhood, we would answer: It is the free and full unfolding of a child\u00d5s individual spirit in the course of time so that this active spirit is unhindered in growing to its full expression and full potential within the child\u00d5s soul, life, and body. When a child\u00d5s spirit waxes strong and becomes Isn\u00d5t it interesting (and tragic) how an idea that seems self-evident today\u00d1that infants and children need warm and loving human contact in order to survive, grow, and develop properly\u00d1took so long to be understood and accepted? Philip Incao 11 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1the master in its own house, then balance, harmony, and health are the results, both in soul and in body. But our spirit is accompanied by a co-worker\u00d1the human soul\u00d1as unpredictable as the wind! Spirit and soul are linked in their activity like fire and air. When spirit rules, our inner flame burns steadily and quietly, suffusing our mind and our actions with its warmth and light. When soul rules, we are prone to mood swings: from a mighty wind which fans an inferno to a stifling calm which causes the inner flame of our spirit to choke and sputter. Fire and Ice, Blood and Nerve These polar opposite forces in the human being were called Yin and Y ang in Ancient Chinese wisdom, and Love and Hate in the Ancient Greek philosophy of Empedocles. Steiner called them Sympathy and Antipathy, perceiving them, as the ancients did, as the bipolar primal energy working in the universe and expressing itself in forces of nature like heat and cold, or positive and negative electricity, but also expressing itself in the human being as the primal warm, effusive, expansive energy of our blood and the primal cool, focusing and condensing energy of our nerves, brain, and sense organs. Robert Frost\u00d5s little gem of a poem \u00d2Fire and Ice\u00d3 offers a succinct poetic picture of these twin primal forces. Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice.From what I\u00d5ve tasted of desireI hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hateT o say that for destruction iceIs also greatAnd would suffice.It is the mastery and discernment of our spirit, working in every system and function of our physical body, which keeps harmony in its household between these mighty opposing powers, our inner Fire and our inner Ice, and our spirit transforms and heals their tendency to destructive excess. The unique composition of Yin/Y ang (or Ice/ Fire) imbalances that a child has in body and soul by inheritance or destiny will determine the particular illnesses to which that child will be susceptible. Illness too has a bipolar nature: On the hot side are the acute contagious inflammatory illnesses and on the cold side the chronic degenerative or sclerotic illnesses. These are the twin dangers we must navigate on our life\u00d5s journey, as between Scylla and Charybdis, between Fire and Ice. A Great Reversal Throughout recorded history the fiery acute inflammatory illnesses have always predominated as the chief causes of death because the human constitution always tended to the warm side, thus making us susceptible to inflammations. But in the brief course of the past 100 years, the illness pattern of all previous recorded history has suddenly reversed itself, as we\u00d5ve seen. Now, in all developed nations, the cold illnesses prevail: cancer, heart disease, and stroke in adults; asthma, allergies, cancer, neurological and emotional dysfunction in our children. What is the deeper meaning of this sudden and profound reversal? From 1900 to the 1950s the health and survival of children improved because the cooling and focusing effect of modern industrial and intellectual civilization made them less susceptible to the acute contagious hot inflammations which up until that time had claimed children\u00d5s lives. After a brief period of healthy Based on Steiner\u00d5s fourfold model, we could answer this question as follows: health is the harmonious balance in the rhythmical workings of spirit, soul, life, and body in us, a household in which our spirit should rule, and not another member of 12 Tending the Flame Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1balance during the 1950s, children\u00d5s health has worsened since 1960, due to the further intensification of the same cooling and condensing forces which improved their health from 1900 to 1950. We were on the right track, but we overreached the healthy balance point, and the pendulum has rapidly swung to the opposite side. Through the effects on our children of our modern materialistic and technological culture, especially modern education and medicine, we have brought about a constitutional change in children that has made them more resistant to the life-threatening acute inflammations of the past, but also more vulnerable to the modern life-burdening chronic conditions at the opposite end of the illness spectrum. Children are indeed the canaries in the coal mine. In their distress they are crying out to us to wake up to the health-weakening and spirit- dampening aspects of modern life so that we will understand how to protect and nurture the delicate growth and unfolding of their individual spirits. This spiritual unfolding is nothing less than a child\u00d5s entire developmental process. What we call brain development, neurological maturation, and the like are the all-important physical effects resulting from a healthy and balanced spiritual development. Human Warmth In the forgotten story of hospitalism, we have seen the devastating effects on children\u00d5s development that emotional deprivation, a lack of human warmth, can have. But what is human warmth? Is it the 104\u00fb Fahrenheit body temperature in our child which frightens us, or is it the caring interest shown to us by a friend which consoles us, or is it the steady burn of enthusiasm which energizes us to carry through an important project? It doesn\u00d5t take a lot of imagination to see that all three are human warmth. Warmth is the bridge between mind and body, the unique element interconnecting body, soul, and spirit in us. Like water for fishes, warmth for humans is the indispensable all-pervading medium both within us and among us that supports and nourishes our humanity at every level of its existence. Through warmth we connect. We connect to our family, our friends, our teachers, our co-workers, to all humanity, to animals, to plants\u00d1in short to the entire universe and all that inhabits it. A growing child must find its inner ground, its center of warmth, and from this solid ground seek to connect to other sources of warmth, in an ever-widening circle around itself, from immediate family all the way to God. But today\u00d5s child understandably has great difficulty finding its connection to the world when that world is portrayed by modern science and education as ultimately an arrangement of atoms and molecules devoid of any higher meaning or purpose, and hence devoid of any human or spiritual warmth. Standing on Solid Ground This failure to connect, which causes so much dysfunction and quiet despair in our children and all too often horrible violence, stems ultimately from the fact that our culture and our society are missing the boat. The solid ground referred to earlier, which we all need and seek, is not the cells and molecules of our physical body; it is our human warmth. T echnology has enhanced many aspects of our lives, but no technology, whether in the form of video screen or loudspeaker, drug or vaccination, can be a source of human warmth. That is why our children are growing inwardly colder.A growing child must find its inner ground, its center of warmth, and from this solid ground seek to connect to other sources of warmth, in an ever-widening circle around itself, from immediate family all the way to God. Running Head 13 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 to permeate our inner density, opacity, and coldness with the spirit\u00d5s healing warmth and light. When this attempt is overzealous and threatens our life or functional capacity, we can be very grateful that modern medicine has empowered us with the tools and techniques to suppress and control inflammation. But we must use that power with discretion. T o suppress all inflammation indiscriminately, out of fear and misunderstanding, with antibiotics, vaccinations, and anti-inflammatory drugs contributes enormously to just this condition of spirit-rejecting density of body and soul described in this article. Health, after all, is a state of balance, and we must learn to avoid overreaching that balance with our fear-based and overzealous efforts to conquer illness. To Heal, Not Suppress The surging consumer interest in Waldorf education and in complementary- alternative medicine in our country is a sign that our paradigm in education and in medicine is shifting. Still, what is urgently needed is a widespread awareness of the critical difference between healing an illness and suppressing it. Healing empowers our spirit; suppression cools the spirit\u00d5s activity in the body. Repeated suppression may hinder the capacity of our human spirit to express itself in us and may transform our acute illnesses into chronic ones. The spirit renews as well as destroys, and now that we have the power in our technology to block even the spirit\u00d5s power, we must acquire the discernment to use that power wisely, or else cause our children and ourselves great suffering.Physicians can learn marvelous truths from patients, if we have the ears to hear them. Just recently a mother reported to me that her weary, uncomfortable eight-year-old child said to her around 2 a.m. during his third night of fever, \u00d2Mom, you know what I need? I need some new ground to stand on.\u00d3 If modern education and medicine are to strengthen our essential humanity, they must learn that this solid ground derives from the human spirit, not from the human body. As the ancients knew, the human spirit manifests in warmth, in fire: the fire of love, the fire of enthusiasm, and, in the physical body, that most misunderstood and most feared of all fires\u00d1the fire of fever. The Renewing Flame Fever remodels and renews the physical body, making it a truer and more responsive instrument of the spirit. How often have mothers told me of the developmental leap in emotional and neurological maturity their child has taken after working through a fever that was not suppressed with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. And conversely, how often have I seen children, whose inflammations were repeatedly suppressed with these drugs, lose their spark and stagnate in their development. One of the most effective ways to reverse the increasing cooling and densification of our children\u00d5s souls and bodies, and of our own, is to recognize the healing, enlightening, spirit-permeating power of feverish inflammatory illness. Seen truly, inflammation is never the real illness; it is the attempt of our immune system Healing ourselves, our children, and the Earth is one and the same task. T o accomplish this will require a revolution in all aspects of modern science, especially so in agriculture, medicine, psychology, education, and parenting. It will require great discernment, courage, and good will. It will require of us nothing less than a practical, down-to-earth embodying of the spirit\u00d5s Philip Incao 1314 Running Head Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 Healing ourselves, our children, and the Earth is one and the same task.

A lot of the behavior that worries us in later childhood, such as aggression, hyperactivity, obesity, depression, and poor school performance, has already been shaped by children\u00d5s experiences in babyhood. For those of you who have not studied the scientific literature, this might seem a bit far-fetched. I was rather amazed at just how significant babyhood is when I first undertook the research for my book Why Love Matters. But over and over again, as people look into it, they discover that this really is the case. Just to take one recent example, the World Health Organisation recently published a report from their Commission on the social determinants of health which stated: \u00d2Research now shows that many challenges in adult society\u00d1mental health problems, obesity/stunting, heart disease, criminality, competence in literacy and numeracy\u00d1have their roots in early childhood.\u00d3 They went on to say: \u00d2Economists now assert on the basis of the available evidence that investment in early childhood is the most powerful investment a country can make, with returns over the life course many times the amount of the original investment.\u00d3 The Over-Riding Importance of Early Conditions The strange fact is that very often the early conditions of our lives have a profound impact on the whole of our development. Let me start by describing how this works with regard to the body and physical health, which might seem more obvious because we can see that nutrition affects the body. The body grows or it does not. It develops healthy organs or it does not. And, actually, the early development of the body\u00d5s organs and other systems are affected by the nutrition available at that time. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that birth weight and early nutrition have a big influence on later health such as susceptibility to heart disease, obesity, and T ype 2 diabetes. Much of the early research was done by David Barker from Southampton University. He explains the process in terms of the fetus or baby adapting to the conditions in which it finds itself. If those conditions are of under-nourishment, the growing body has to adapt the way it handles sugar and fat, or the way the heart manages blood pressure. These adaptations, as he put it, \u00d2tend to have permanent effects on the body\u00d5s structure and functioning\u00d1a phenomenon referred to as \u00d4programming \u00d5.\u00d3 The poorly nourished babies have also been found by other researchers to have higher cortisol levels throughout adult life, suggesting that their stress response had been programmed in the womb or in infancy (Seckl & Meaney 2004). As Barker explains, these early adaptations allow the fetus and the baby to survive the immediate dangers of their situation, but have long term consequences\u00d1often at the price of a shortened lifespan. The links between infancy and later health and longevity are already being taken seriously by the European Union (EU). For some years the European Union has been funding an Early Nutrition Programming Project based in Munich (coordinated by Professor Koletzko of the Children\u00d5s Hospital, University of Munich, Germany), which has been looking at these links. Other major organizations recognize the links too. The World Health Organisation recommends at least six months of breastfeeding to protect the development of a child\u00d5s immune system. TResearch Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1But my focus is on emotional health, and in particular how the brain systems that manage our emotional responses are just as much shaped by early events. They too are \u00d2programmed\u00d3 in a very similar way. Not by food input\u00d1although that plays its part in nurturing our biochemical systems\u00d1but by the way that a baby adapts to the relationship environment and structures his brain accordingly, in order to survive in the situation in which he finds himself. Just as the baby\u00d5s body adapts to a shortage of nutrition, so the brain adapts to inadequate emotional input. The Human Brain The human brain is unique. It shares many of the same features as animals\u00d5 brains, but it is a kind of extended version. It starts off with a basic reptilian brain based around the brain stem\u00d1this is what supports the basic life functions, and this is the first part of our brain to develop, too. Then, as with other mammals, it adds various new capacities (based in the center of the brain) including nurturing abilities. But what really makes humans human is basically the massive post-natal development of the outer layers of the brain, the cerebral cortex. One of the first parts of this layer to develop is the pre-frontal section, which grows extremely rapidly in the first year or two of life. It is an area which is not fully formed at birth but which connects up in response to social stimulation in infancy. Brain development, or learning, is actually the process of creating, strengthening, and discarding connections among the neurons. These connections are called synapses. There are not many at birth but they sprout rapidly in the first year of life and eventually form neural pathways that connect the different parts of the brain and organize its functions. The pre-frontal cortex is the area of the brain I am most concerned with. It is what I call the social brain, which is a shorthand way of referring to a range of areas in and around the pre-frontal cortex. We know from scientific research that this social brain area is activated when we are involved in controlling our emotions, paying close attention to other people and their social signals, thinking about feelings, and having empathy for others. It is the area of the brain that extends out of the more basic instinctive ways of behaving\u00d1such as fight or flight reactions\u00d1which are based in the amygdala and hypothalamus. The social brain\u00d5s job is basically to organize and supervise those more basic responses. But this human emotional control center does not develop automatically. The social brain develops in response to the social experiences that a baby actually has. Neural pathways get laid down as a result of actual experiences, so, for example, the baby needs someone to give her an experience of emotions being managed helpfully before she can learn to do these things for herself and manage her own feelings well. Basically, babies learn how to do things through their experiences with other people, not through words or instructions. They learn how to cope with stress by having an experience of someone being with them and helping them to cope. But they need to have these experiences consistently, over and over again, to lay down the pathways, during the first and second years of life. As I mentioned earlier, the first year of life is about making connections in the brain. But during the second and third years of childhood that huge tangled mass of connections starts to get \u00d2pruned,\u00d3 on a \u00d2use it or lose it\u00d3 basis. Basically, we keep the pathways that are most used and most useful in our particular social environment\u00d1and lose those pathways that have not been used that much. In other words, if as babies and young children we 16 Why Love Matters: How Affection Shapes a Baby's Brain Basically, babies learn how to do things through their experiences with other people, not through words or instructions.Sue Gerhardt 17 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1live with angry, aggressive people, we will keep pathways that help us to be alert to anger and aggression, and if we live with people who are attentive to other people, we will keep the pathways that help us to be attentive. Biochemical Systems\u2014the Stress Response and the Soothing System Some of the first pathways to be established in babyhood are the biochemical ones. These biochemical pathways, which I think of as a sort of liquid \u00d2grease,\u00d3 assisting the flow of information around the brain, help the baby to react to his environment quickly and appropriately. In particular, I want to mention two biochemical systems that are really important for emotional well-being\u00d1I refer to them as the stress response and the soothing system. The stress response is a very important biochemical system which develops in infancy. It releases the hormone cortisol to generate extra short-term energy to cope with stresses and dangers of all kinds. Once the objective has been achieved, and safety and social equilibrium are restored, the cortisol is dispersed. But in early babyhood, the stress response is not yet fully functional; babies are very vulnerable and easily stressed\u00d1particularly by situations that feel unsafe, such as being separated from their mother or a familiar person, or being physically hurt. Babies cannot protect themselves from stress or danger nor can they calm themselves down. They are dependent on an adult to protect and calm them, to quickly disperse their cortisol for them and to help them get back to a stable state. If the adults taking care of them do not manage their states for them, they can become flooded with cortisol without having any way of getting rid of it. Even in toddlerhood, they are still vulnerable, and need to feel that their world is safe and predictable, and that they can rely on others for help when they need it. If babies or toddlers end up being flooded with cortisol on a chronic basis, because the adults looking after them do not respond quickly, do not resolve problems for them, or are, in fact, perhaps emotionally frightening themselves, the stress system will adapt to that particular human environment, and the baby may develop an unusual cortisol response\u00d1high or low baseline levels of cortisol\u00d1which can have some very negative effects on him/her. Let me give you a glimpse of how this might be passed on from parent to child in practice. I had a client who was a violent offender. He had just come out of prison and was building a relationship with his son, wanting desperately to be a good father. However, the way he interacted with his baby son\u00d1unpredictably shouting at the baby or laughing at the baby\u00d5s distress\u00d1was frightening to the baby. If this had continued, the father would have passed on to his son a feeling of not being safe, having to be vigilant and alert to others\u00d5 aggression. When experiences like this go on day after day, they can have lasting effects on the child\u00d5s biochemical systems. A child who experiences rough treatment, humiliation, aggression, shouting, and so on, has to adapt psychologically. But this is also happening at a biological level. It is thought that high levels of the stress hormone cortisol are eventually down-regulated and children like this end up with a low baseline cortisol level which has been found to be associated with later aggressive behavior. 1 Most people probably develop a healthy stress response if they have a normal childhood. This gives them a good chance of being able to bounce back after difficulties. It means that they have built resilience to stress. Even though they might be temporarily overwhelmed and start to forget things or lose the ability to pay attention, if they have established a healthy stress response in infancy, they are likely to be able to get back to normal quickly. It takes quite a lot of stress over a very long period to create any permanent damage in a basically resilient adult (although it can happen). However, when babies are chronically stressed, this can create permanent damage to their systems so that they grow into adults who are not able to 18 Why Love Matters: How Affection Shapes a Baby's Brain Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1recover quickly from stressful events. They become more vulnerable and sensitive to stress as adults and may seek help in regulating themselves through drugs and alcohol. When adults like my client ignore their children\u00d5s feelings, laugh at them or punish them, the children basically are not going to be learning how to manage feelings or to regulate their feelings. Another aspect of too much cortisol early on is that it can have a knock-on effect on other biochemical systems\u00d1such as the soothing system which is based on the neurotransmitter serotonin. When this system is not in good shape, the baby can grow up finding it difficult to stay calm under stress and may become prone to impulsive outbursts and aggression. Low serotonin levels are part of the picture of mood and anxiety disorders, sleep disturbance, and aggression on into adulthood. I think of these biochemical imbalances as a bit like a physical handicap, a vulnerability which is not necessarily immediately visible, but which can play itself out in later life, even after decades. High levels of cortisol are connected to physical health problems too; in particular research is now demonstrating links with later obesity and heart disease. 2 Prefrontal Development T oo much cortisol early on\u00d1especially during the first three years when the daily pattern of cortisol is established\u00d1can even affect brain structure. In particular, it can damage those areas of the brain that are developing rapidly in the early years because it can be toxic to the development of neural connections just at the time when the connections are being made and the pathways established. Children who are traumatized early on often have reduced brain volumes in a number of areas, especially the prefrontal cortex: Literally, they have smaller brains. In other words, the volume of a child\u00d5s brain can be shaped by experience; scientific research has shown that a child who is severely neglected physically as well as emotionally can have a dramatically reduced brain size. 3Neglect or stress can seriously affect the social brain, as well as other areas such as the amygdala, the cingulate, and the hippocampus, which are all important for emotional life. The crucial age for prefrontal emotional development is the period from the second part of the first year through toddlerhood, when the medial prefrontal cortex is developing most rapidly and is most susceptible to influence. It becomes functional at around 18 months to two years, by which time the child has become a self\u00d1that is, she can recognize herself in the mirror and has acquired the basic capacities for self-awareness and self-control. The Importance of Positive Experiences It is just as important to make sure that babies receive positive experiences as it is that they avoid negative ones. The whole process of developing a social brain and developing a strong sense of self is based on the quality of social attention the baby receives. The more pleasurable social experiences the baby has, the more this part of the brain connects. The less attention a baby receives, the less this part of the brain connects. In the worst cases, for instance some of the most abused Romanian orphans, this area of the brain was virtually a black hole, according to one researcher, Harry Chugani. Basically, humans have to pass on a social brain. It does not develop automatically, but only as the result of an adult\u00d5s investing attention in the baby. Babies learn to notice their own feelings when they receive a lot of responses to their feelings from the adults looking after them. Then, in turn, once they have that self-awareness, they can use it to become aware of other people\u00d5s feelings and to have empathy for others. It is the same with self-control. The social brain has the potential to influence and control our impulsive reactions arising via the amygdala, reactions such as wanting to hit someone when we are angry with him. However, these inhibitory brain pathways are only laid down if the toddler has the experience of adults making firm but kind demands on him to restrain his inappropriate behaviors, and (W)hen babies are chronically stressed, this can create permanent damageto their systems and they grow into adults who are not able to recover quickly Sue Gerhardt 19 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1doing so consistently, over and over again. These capacities are also established very early on indeed. A researcher in the U.S.A., Grazyna Kochanska, has shown that self-control measured at 22 months predicts its presence at ages three and four, and another researcher showed that early self-control is linked to later empathy at age eight (Guthrie 1997). It is a central aspect of social behavior. In fact, it is not only important for managing behavior, but interesting recent research by Clancy Blair (at Pennsylvania State University) is suggesting that it is this same self-control and self-regulation which underpins academic ability, over and above the child\u00d5s intelligence. These learned social and emotional abilities make it possible later on in school for children to pay attention to teachers and to learn in other ways. Basically, the brain is built up through actual experiences. What you put in is more or less what you get out. If we want to produce children who are calm, resilient, capable of empathy and foresight, we need to help parents pass on these qualities by providing a lot of support for early parenting, by which I mean helping parents who are not confident in their parenting, for instance my client. We also need to make it possible for parents to spend a lot of time with their babies and small children, paying lots of attention to their feelings and helping them to manage their behavior. Poor Early Care Leads to Problems I cannot include here everything that I talk about more fully in Why Love Matters. But I am not just talking about providing the optimum conditions for children\u00d5s brain development. I also see early development as the key to preventing future social problems. Often, I feel that there is a lack of awareness about the early roots of problems. For example, I recently read a piece suggesting that bullying at school led to later mental health problems\u00d1low self-esteem, depression, and anti-social behavior. Y et the writer assumed that these problems had all started in school with the bullying. He did not seem to be asking why particular children are bullied or how this might be the effect of patterns of behavior established much earlier in life. Actually, bullies rarely target children who have high self-esteem and confidence. They are more likely to target those who already show anxiety and vulnerability. I would like to briefly outline a few of the ways in which poor early development can play out in later life: For example, babies who live with a depressed mother are at risk of growing up to be depressed themselves; they may develop a hypersensitive stress response and a less active left brain. This is not true of those whose mothers are depressed when their children are older. Mental health problems such as personality disorders are, in many ways, a manifestation of inadequate early emotional care: people who have not been taught how to manage feelings well or to think about them, who have extreme emotional reactions and who often display a lack of empathy for others. A similar story lies behind anti-social behavior. Children whose parents express hostility, who fail to model how to resolve conflicts or how to maintain self-control often become the offenders of tomorrow. A lack of a warm bond at the age of two tends to predict later anti-social problems (Belsky 1998), whilst, as I have said, a lack of self-control at age two tends to predict it at subsequent ages (Kochanska). Without a warm attentive early relationship, the prefrontal brain is less likely to develop well.20 Why Love Matters: How Affection Shapes a Baby's Brain Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1Endnotes 1.

After the Vietnam War, accounts came in from various sides of soldiers who were able to reenter everyday civilian life only with great effort. People in Europe are also worried about the NATO soldiers\u00d5 ability to deal with trauma after they have been deployed on peace-keeping missions abroad. The question is, how does an individual cope with traumatic or otherwise shattering events in his or her life? This question is just as valid for children as for adults. Research into these questions is essentially the study of resilience: overcoming, processing \u00d2insurmountable\u00d3 experiences, drawing upon the soul\u00d5s (mental) power of resistance (resilire = to spring back, to rebound). This research arose after World War II when people were faced with the fact that there were those who inwardly overcame their experiences of war or prison and were able to resume a \u00d2normal\u00d3 life once their soul wounds had healed. However, at the same time, there were those who never really overcame these experiences and kept suffering from the trauma of war. The question arose: On what does this ability to inwardly overcome experiences depend? What makes one child strong in taking life\u00d5s knocks, what makes another child react so much more sensitively? From regions where people have been hit by great natural disasters\u00d0\u00d0by contrast with war zones\u00d0\u00d0we hear relatively little about the lasting trauma they endured and how inwardly they have, or have not, come to terms with them. Research into resilience has arrived at several conclusions that have considerable significance for educators in particular. The first issue is whether the soul\u00d5s power of resistance may be explained by heredity. If the parents have inner strength, is it passed on to their offspring? According to numerous studies this is not the case. Resilience is not inherited. However, resilience is definitely connected with experiences during the early years of childhood. One researcher thinks it is a matter of the first four or five years while another thinks the whole time of childhood is significant, that is, until the tenth year. Leaving aside these different viewpoints of timing, there is agreement that the soul\u00d5s power of resistance, or resilience, is nurtured and developed if children have had the following five experiences: 1. A Reliable, Stable Relationship with One Person This person does not necessarily need to be the mother, but it is necessary for it to be a single person in the beginning. Later on this person may be joined by others. Neurologists also point out that at the start of life there must be only one person to relate to. Later on a second, followed by a third or fourth person may be added to the child\u00d5s circle of relationships\u00d1just not in the beginning. 2. An Authoritative Upbringing This means that the child requires the fundamental experience that others (involved in its upbringing) decide for him/her and that he/she is completely relieved of the need to make decisions. Simply from the experience that others make the D22 Research into Resilience Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1right decisions the child gains a sense of security in life\u00d1in other words, trust. This experience cannot be overestimated. Inwardly the child knows, \u00d2T o begin with, others decide what is good or bad for me, what is right and wrong, healthy and unhealthy.\u00d3 A deep sense of security arises from the feeling: \u00d2I can leave it up to the world to take over; I can rely upon my surroundings in all circumstances.\u00d3 3. Learning through Example This has two aspects. On one hand, a moral quality makes a deep impression: What children experience through the behavior of those around them should be completely compatible with what is demanded of them. If children are forbidden to watch television and the people they relate to watch unlimited amounts of television, the children\u00d5s understanding of their surroundings as a totality cracks open. One can add many other examples. On the other hand, there is something else at stake too. When the Canadian psychologist Albert Bandura discovered the so-called mirror neurons and their activity in the human brain, the interesting question arose whether, generally speaking, children learn primarily with their intellect or from imitation, from \u00d2doing it like this.\u00d3 Bandura argued vehemently that the young child learns from imitating, not through cognition, something he documents impressively through the process of learning to speak. T o date, in the practice of teaching, the idea that children up to the age of ten learn in a more carefree way through imitation than through ceaselessly drumming things into their heads is scarcely to be found. Through the process of learning arithmetic, for example, by developing habits rather than exercising the intellect, the child develops self-confidence as he/she learns \u00d2externally.\u00d3 He/she feels affirmed through the certainty of habit. The research described here\u00d1which is derived not from an anthroposophical-anthropological milieu, but from conventional experiment\u00d1endorses the statement by Rudolf Steiner that from around the twelfth year intellectual or cognitive learning takes on more and more significance. Only with Steiner this change in approach to learning is called \u00d2becoming capable of forming judgments.\u00d3 In other words, the learning process is increasingly guided and determined by the child\u00d5s own powers of discrimination, no longer by habit. 4. A Qualitative Approach to Time What is the difference between the morning and the evening for our feeling about life? What is the difference between autumn and spring, summer and winter for our feeling about life? Within a Christian context, how does the Easter festival differ from Christmas? Or within an Islamic context, how, for example, does the sugar festival differ from the beginning of Ramadan? How does the child experience the ordering of time, how do we help it to experience the ordering of time? Here is one quite simple example: When I was still quite young, people in Holland celebrated the Queen\u00d5s birthday at the end of spring. This was the season when we used to visit the annual fair and to celebrate the day we would be given cotton candy on a wooden stick. In our minds as children, this cotton candy developed into the quintessence of the celebration of the Queen\u00d5s birthday. Many biographies describe rituals linked to the seasons. There is also the simple fact of going to bed. Is it a random activity because we are tired, or is there a small ritual belonging to this moment (when we take our leave of the day) that is entirely different from waking up in the morning? We can see from the way time is treated in Waldorf kindergartens and schools that these festivals are not celebrated merely for their own sake, but rather out of some developmental insight. Whoever wants to give shape to his or her life, whoever refuses simply to be \u00d2lived\u00d3 by events, has to shape time. 5. A Surplus of Positive School Experiences This basis for resilience scarcely requires an Christof Wiechert 23 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1explanation. Nonetheless, it ought to be pointed out that still today insufficient attention is paid to the lingering effects of negative experiences suffered during the early years of schooling. Many educational traumas can accompany an individual life-long, wounds of which the school (or the teachers) are often not aware. In other words, whatever basis is laid down for the mood of soul at school plays a key role in the lives of children well into their adult years; it is an important reason for schools and teachers to ask themselves how the pupils are faring. This is by no means to deny that school is a place where pupils need to go through crises. What is at stake is the overcoming of difficulties and whether pupils feel sufficiently accepted by their teachers. We will have no difficulty, after reading the above account, in recognizing the basic requirements of education; they need to be based on helping the child develop resilience. We are dealing here with only one aspect, however, of resilience. Another aspect concerns the so-called education arising from the experience of emergencies. How do we help children who have survived natural disasters or war disasters? Nowadays, we know that what enables children to work through trauma more than anything else is art or artistic activity. The hygienic effect of artistic practice has been documented in many places and confirms the healing power that can come from art. Art needs to become a fully integrated element of every form of educ ation.

T o my delight, both Dr. Elizabeth Schaughency and Associate Professor Elaine Reese agreed. The research initially began with three ages of children (in their first, third, and fifth years of school), in three state, and in three Rudolf Steiner schools in the South Island, New Zealand. After months of working with children in both types of schools, I was frequently struck by the way in which the young five- and six-year-old state school children could work their way through texts, usually quite fluently, whereas the Rudolf Steiner school pupils showed very little interest in doing so. I often wondered how such an initial gap in reading could ever be closed. After the beginning phases of visiting schools and working with the children and teachers, we had collected enough data for reliable preliminary analyses (this particular study was conducted over two full school years, thus the complete findings were some time away). At that early stage in the project, it was still possible to observe that the reading achievement of the Rudolf Steiner school pupils, on average, seemed to \u00d2take off\u00d3 somewhere between grades III and V . I began to second-guess the patterns emerging from the results. Was the sample of Rudolf Steiner school pupils going to be large enough to trust the findings? Or was perhaps one of the classes in the study a \u00d2freak\u00d3 class (e.g., particularly intelligent), skewing the data? A second study was conceived to firm up the available evidence. This second study focused on a new sample of 11- and 12-year-old Y ear 7 state school students and grade VI pupils from around New Zealand. The results from this project corroborated those of the earlier study still underway\u00d1the state and Steiner school pupils were again reading at a similar level. By the end of our research project, we had extensive data from around 400 pupils and, after taking account of differences in children\u00d5s school and home environments, as well as developmental differences such as language ability, the data robustly suggested that by around age ten, there was no difference in reading achievement between children who had been given early instruction in reading and those who had not. In order to augment the findings with supporting evidence from other sources, I began to search for published data from well-known international studies (e.g., PISA). T o my surprise, such rich data sets had only beenquantitatively analyzed and published once before (and in a methodologically problematic manner at that) with respect to looking for an effect of early reading instruction. After I had taken account of differences in countries\u00d5 economic, educational, and social development, the analyses found no advantage, by age 15, attributable to beginning formal schooling before age seven. It was particularly pleasing for me that people involved in early childhood education\u00d1according to responses I have received\u00d1have taken these findings, by and large, as a relief. Many have felt frustrated by societal pressure to teach young A Reading Research Supports the Waldorf Approach26 Reading Research Supports the Waldorf Approach Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1children to read. It is perhaps also fair to mention that national literacy-based standards in education for young children would appear to be empirically questionable as well in the light of this research. Finally, a clear benefit exists for Waldorf education; now empirical data exist supporting the Waldorf approach to reading. The entire experience has bolstered my conviction that\u00d1as Rudolf Steiner repeatedly asserted\u00d1with care and rigor, many of the assertions of Spiritual Science can be tested with conventional scientific methodology.References Suggate, S.

And that is through current thinking by a human being. \u00d0 Dietrich Rapp 1 How Does Reality Arise? Reality is supposed to exist somewhere beyond the realm of human cognition. We are said to take cognizance of this reality through sense perception only. Our cognition is said merely to mirror this sense world. In modern times, the tendency has developed to view cognition in this way. How do human cognition and reality relate for Rudolf Steiner? Of what significance is this for us today? In his foundational works, Rudolf Steiner intensively pursued the question of how reality arises in the process of cognition. Rather than devising erudite academic theories, he breached a willed pathway into thinking, from which he sensitively observed the activity of cognition, exploring the role of thinking in the process of cognition through introspective (soul) observation. He describes the process of acquiring concepts through intuitive thinking in his Philosophy of Freedom from increasingly comprehensive vantage points, only to concede one exception on the next to last page of the last chapter in which we \u00d2bring concepts over into our own spirit in a pure form,\u00d3 unmixed with conceptual content won through intuition. Before taking a closer look at this exception, we should turn our attention to the regular process of cognition. How does the human being apprehend the world? What role does perception play therein? What role mental representation and what role conceptual thinking? How does reality arise? Based on introspective (soul) observation, Steiner describes the relationship between cognition and reality in a remark of 1924 to an early epistemological work from the year 1886 as follows: Within the inner life of the soul, a content arises which craves external perception as the hungry organism craves food; and in the external world there is a perceptual content which does not bear its essential being in itself but manifests this only when it is united with the soul content through the process of cognition. Thus the process of cognition becomes part of the formation of the reality of the world. The human being participates in the formation of this world-reality through the act of cognition. If a plant-root is unthinkable without the fulfillment of its predisposition in the fruit, so likewise not only the human being but the world itself remains unfinished without the act of cognition. In the act of cognition, the human being does not create something just for himself, but he creatively participates together with the world in making reality manifest. What shows in the human being is ideal appearance; what shows in the perceptible world is sense appearance; only the cognizant inter-working of both brings reality into being. 2Thinking and the Sense of Thinking: How We Perceive Thoughts28 Thinking and the Sense of Thinking: How We Perceive Thoughts Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 There is no reality to be found through cognition \u00d2because it must first be created as reality through cognition.\u00d3 This realization remained pivotal for Steiner throughout his life. What Is Sense Perception? What Is Mental Representation? Now the human being is met by the world of \u00d2sense manifestation\u00d3 fractured into different fields of sense perceptions. The human soul constantly permeates these sense perceptions with concepts, arising from the soul as \u00d2manifestation of the idea.\u00d3 In accord with these concepts, the human being, exercising judgment, brings the different percepts together. Only thus does one-ness come about in our experience of the world. Shortly before the first Waldorf school opened in 1919, Steiner remarked to the future teachers: And now you can understand exercising judgment as a living process in your own body, which comes about through the fact that the senses confront you with the world analyzed into fragments. The world confronts you with twelve different fragments in what you experience, and through exercising judgment, you bring the elements together, because what is apart does not want to remain apart. 3 The human being thus constantly merges sense perceptions into mental representations, which are then experienced as coherent objects in the world. Forming these mental representations requires an activity of the will. This becomes particularly evident when we picture space forms, as the following figure can exemplify: This can be seen as a three-dimensional cube. Suddenly, however, it can turn into a different cube! If we are attentive to the moment when the switch takes place, we notice that it is we who, by the power of our will, engrave the three-dimensionality into the two-dimensional picture. Clearly outlined objects as well as black lines against a white background prompt us to follow the contours with our eyes. Each movement we do, including the movement of our eyes, is perceived through our sense of movement. Due to their spherical shape, the eyes are very special limbs: they move independently of the force of gravity. Now all movements performed by our limbs are acts of will; however, only the movements of the eyes are acts of will performed in a weightless realm. And it is exactly the perception of these acts of will that is most likely to animate us to develop the activity of the will in the weightless realm of mental representations. The sense perception of the two-dimensional picture can prompt us to will the three-dimensional representation of the cube. If people\u00d5s experiences were restricted to the sense world, a cube drawn on a sheet of paper would never be seen. That we can see it nonetheless is due to the fact that people divide the world into space-filling objects by forming mental representations and experiencing these self-formed Detlef Hardorp 29 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1mental representations in the world. These mental representations are mistaken for sense perception only to the extent that our own thinking and representing activities are not sufficiently observed. When merging the different elements of sense perception into mental representations, the human being is active beyond this realm of sense perception. And here, in this realm of actively formed mental representations that reach beyond sense perception, concepts can emanate; they are \u00d2abstracted\u00d3 out of the mental representations. 4 Such concepts may well be tied to the sense world. That does not mean, however, that the concepts themselves are content of a sense perception. They simply are formed in accord with sense perception. Where Do Thoughts Come From? In 1909, Rudolf Steiner for the first time sketched the foundations of a comprehensive overview of the fields of sense perception to members of what was then the Theosophical Society. The title of the lectures 5 was simply \u00d2Anthroposophy,\u00d3 that is to say, anthroposophy as the link between anthropology and theosophy, as described at the beginning of the first lecture. Steiner then proceeded to describe the ten basic senses of the human being, the last of which he called the sense of concept or the sense of mental representation (later he also called it the sense of thinking or sense of thought). This sense does not empower us to perceive our own thoughts but the thoughts expressed by our fellow human beings. Could it be possible nonetheless that this sense allows us to perceive other thoughts beyond the thoughts expressed by other people? Could it be that we grasp the concepts of outer world objects through a sense of concept as Steiner understood this sense? What first weighs against this idea is that then the anthroposophical approach to sense perception would diametrically oppose the epistemological foundations of anthroposophy itself: Concepts arise from within the soul, whereas all sense manifestation streams in from the outside, engaging the soul. In his Philosophy of Freedom of 1894, Rudolf Steiner calls the arising of concepts within the soul \u00d2intuition.\u00d3 There, the sense of concept is not mentioned. Did Steiner discover the sense of concept later on, with the consequence that his earlier, radical epistemological approach grew more moderate by allowing some concepts of outer world objects to be perceived nonetheless by the senses? Under which circumstances is a thought a perception of the concept or thought sense? Under which circumstances does it originate in one\u00d5s own thinking or memory? I\u00d5d like to focus on the questions I\u00d5ve just raised and, in particular, attempt to contribute toward the understanding of concept-, thinking-, and thought-sense. When Are Concepts not Acquired through Intuition? In the fourth of the five \u00d2Anthroposophy\u00d3 lectures about the senses, a few days after mentioning the sense of concept or thought for the first time, Rudolf Steiner spoke extensively about the relationship between the outer world and the thoughts by which people grasp the objects of the outer world conceptually. He started as follows:People would become increasingly isolated from one another in the sense world if the sense of concept or thought wouldn\u00d5t make it possible to reconnect thoughts directly, from one person to the other. A person who is not himself in the process of evolving 30 Running Head Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 The human being must indeed think within himself. Objects don\u00d5t think for us; they don\u00d5t show us the thoughts from without, but rather we must bring the thoughts toward the objects. That is the great secret, one is inclined to say, of the relation of human thought to the outer world. No thoughts approach the human being through sense organs. If the sense organs themselves have irregularities, sensory illusions can easily occur. Whereas in normal life, the senses do not err, the mind, which cannot put itself in relationship to objects, can err. It is the first member of the human being that can err, because its activity is dammed up within the brain and this activity cannot reach out. What follows from this? It follows that it is quite impossible for people to have thoughts about the outer world that are right if we do not have an inner disposition which allows right thoughts to arise within us. Never\u00d0\u00d0as can be seen from this\u00d0\u00d0could the outer world provide people with right thoughts if the right thoughts would not well up inside us. It can provide them with right sense perception. Y et sense perceptions cannot think. A thought, however, is prone to error, and the human being must have the inner strength for the veracity of the thought. 6 How far, then, is it justified to speak of a sense of thought or concept at all? Cognition occurs when the right concept arises within us and unites with the percept. There is only one exception to this, when concepts cannot arise within us: that is when we perceive our fellow human being, whose I, in its uniqueness, gives birth to freely begotten thoughts in the sense realm. I cannot grasp, in my own thinking, the germinating moment of these freely begotten thoughts of other people, because I am not you. I must silence my own thinking in order to sufficiently become you. T oward the end of the last chapter of his Philosophy of Freedom of 1894, Rudolf Steiner already described the necessity of the sense of concept for the emergence of freedom within humanity: Cognition consists in linking a concept with a percept through thinking. For all other objects, the observer must penetrate to the concept by means of his or her own intuition. Understanding a free individuality is exclusively a question of bringing over into our own spirit in a pure form (unmixed with our own conceptual content) those concepts by which the individuality determines itself. People who immediately mix their own concepts into any judgment of others can never attain understanding of an individuality. 7 In the sense world, it becomes possible to think freely begotten thoughts. This would split humanity; people would become increasingly isolated from one another in the sense world if the sense of concept or thought wouldn\u00d5t make it possible to reconnect thoughts directly, from one person to the other. What Is Perceived Via the Sense of Thought? We can best become aware of the necessity of the sense of thought when perceiving the freely begotten thoughts of the other human being, but of course this sense doesn\u00d5t perceive only those thoughts. Through the sense of thought (or sense of concept or mental representation or thinking), I can perceive, while listening without interference of my own concepts and my own judgment, how the other person forms thoughts into personal, individualized mental representations. Everybody\u00d5s thoughts are initially imbued with his or her own mental representations. Each thought has its own shading, its own nuance of feeling, its own degree of sparkling intensity, according to how its author 30 Thinking and the Sense of Thinking: How We Perceive Thoughts Running Head 31 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 mentally represents the thought. Now the more strength for the accuracy of thought is brought forth, the deeper thinking breaks through to the universality of concept. As we universalize the personal content of our thoughts, the universal strength of thought becomes individualized. The way in which thought content becomes universal increasingly bears the signature of the \u00d2I.\u00d3 In order to be able to perceive, in its immediacy, the way in which a thought is coined by a human being incarnated in the sense world\u00d0\u00d0be it the coining of everyday thoughts or the coining of nascent individualized free thought\u00d0\u00d0his fellow human being needs the sense of thinking, thought, or concept. This sense in fact allows people developing between birth and death to grow into the body of the social organism. It is not the concepts of the objects of the outer world that penetrate the human being through his sense of concept, but the concepts which live in the inner world of the other person that manifest themselves through this sense. Concepts are sense-perceptible only to the extent that other people bring them to manifestation. This is why children put their never-ending questions to everyone around them. The child himself must also meld sense perception with the corresponding concepts out of his own discerning thinking activity. The child doesn\u00d5t begin by bringing forth concepts out of his own thinking; he first develops his own thinking through the concepts taken in from the people around him. 8 It is an innate gift of the child to be able to take in concepts in their immediacy through the sense of concept. The young child cannot but immerse himself in his human surroundings with love and devotion. The stronger the personal discerning power of thinking develops, the more problematic it becomes for the sense of thinking. Personal thinking awakens one\u00d5s self to self-awareness; this self-awareness is at first egocentric. The thinking of the egocentric self, however, does not tolerate the selfless devotion that is prerequisite for the sense of thinking. Therefore this sense only functions when the egocentric self falls into deep sleep, thus not impairing perceptual ability. The only reason we don\u00d5t take notice of our thinking\u00d5s deep sleep is simply that our consciousness is completely filled with the other person's thoughts. While listening, my own thinking intermittently wakes up slightly from its immersion in the thoughts of the other in order to mentally incorporate the other being\u00d5s thoughts into my thought organism. T o the extent that the mind awakens, the perception of the sense of thinking recedes. These moments of \u00d2blackout\u00d3 regarding the thinking gestures of the other person, which are due to our own thinking activity, are sometimes experienced as gaps in consciousness during a conversation: You just manage to notice that the other has just said something, without, however, perceiving any of his thoughts (because you yourself were engaged in thinking). At best you bridge the gap by trying to bring the last spoken words to consciousness out of the lingering resonance of word-recollection, in order to quickly make sense of them out of your own thinking. What Occurs When Listening? Rudolf Steiner\u00d5s most precise description of how it is possible to \u00d2bring over\u00d3 concepts (unmixed with our own conceptual content) via the sense of concept is found in the first appendix to the second edition (1918) of his Philosophy of Freedom. During the act of perception through the sense of thinking, the other person\u00d5s thinking is momentarily taken over into my spirit as if it were my own. While perceiving another personality, I am compelled, as a thinking being, \u00d2to Devotion towards the other being is in particular nurtured by deliberately silencing one\u00d5s own thinking, no matter how wise it may be.Detlef Hardorp 3132 Running Head Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 extinguish my own thinking as long as I am under its influence, and to put its thinking in the place of mine. I then grasp its thinking in my thinking as an experience like my own. I have really perceived another person\u00d5s thinking.\u00d3 9 It is then primarily the individualized way of coining or forming of concepts by the other person that I experience. 10 Steiner continues: ...It is a process lying wholly within my consciousness and consisting in this, that the other person\u00d5s thinking takes the place of mine. Through the self-extinction of the [outer, bodily] sense appearance [of the other person], the separation between the two spheres of consciousness is actually eliminated. 11,12 This expresses itself in my consciousness through the fact that while experiencing the content of another person\u00d5s consciousness I experience my own consciousness as little as I experience it in dreamless sleep. Just as in dreamless sleep my waking consciousness is eliminated, so in my perceiving of the content of another person\u00d5s consciousness the content of my own is eliminated. The illusion that it is not so comes about only because in perceiving the other person, firstly, the extinction of the content of one\u00d5s own consciousness gives place not to unconsciousness, as it does in sleep, but to the content of the other person\u00d5s consciousness, and secondly, the alternations between extinguishing and lighting up again of my own self-consciousness follow too rapidly to be generally noticed. 13 Eight years earlier, Steiner had phrased it as follows in the fragment of his book Anthroposophy: \u00d2What we can experience within our own soul as a concept, we can also receive as revealed from an external being. ... With the concept that lives within another human being, we perceive what lives, soul-like, within ourselves.\u00d3 14 It lives soul-like within ourselves because the thinking of the other is of the same nature as our own thinking and because it is \u00d2brought over into our own spirit in a pure form\u00d3 in the moment of thought perception, \u00d2unmixed with our own conceptual content.\u00d3 15 The quality of social discourse now depends decisively on how a person \u00d2awakens\u00d3 from this \u00d2bringing over,\u00d3 this \u00d2deep-sleep\u00d3 listening activity. 16 Because the child acquires his self-consciousness through the development of his self-centered personality, the waking-up moment is connected with an aggressive self-assertion. When he slackens, the child again \u00d2falls asleep,\u00d3 as it were, into the thoughts of the other being. Insofar as a person does not take his social development consciously in hand, this will remain so into adulthood. Through self-observation in adulthood, however, we can become conscious of the inherent anti-social nature of this waking-up of our personality to its own thinking. If, out of this awareness, you dampen your own personality, a foggy state of mind ensues, excluding yourself from playing an active role in any social setting. At the threshold of awakening, one stands unavoidably between a deep sleep of devoted listening and the anti-social nature of thinking. How Does Listening Interact with Thinking? It can happen that when listening intently to another person, one experiences and fully understands the lively depiction of this other person\u00d5s thoughts in all their richness and depth. However, shortly thereafter one may remember the richness, the depth, the vitality of the lively depiction of the thoughts, but may find oneself hard put to reproduce their content. An autonomous understanding is something quite different from the immediacy of understanding while perceiving with the sense of thinking. During the latter, thoughts blossom between speaker and listener, momentarily living into the listener\u00d5s organism of concept, 17 still carried by the speaker\u00d5s power of thought: The other\u00d5s thinking is active instead of one\u00d5s own. Whether or not we are then able to reproduce the 32 Thinking and the Sense of Thinking: How We Perceive Thoughts Running Head 33 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 other\u00d5s thoughts out of our own power of thinking depends on our ability to think the thoughts independently. After abandoning oneself to the other person\u00d5s thinking for a while, the effect of the thought perception on your own life organism, this rooting of foreign thoughts in your organism of concept, can be felt increasingly as an intrusion, arousing one\u00d5s own thinking in defense. When consequently one expresses one\u00d5s own thinking activity through words or gestures, the whole process begins anew, now with reversed roles. This is how a rapid alternation between extinguishing and relighting of your own self-consciousness comes about. This alternation can come to life in a variety of ways, in particular by training my thinking, while awakening, to be less influenced by my personality. The more universal my thinking, the longer it can remain devoted to the foreign thought, out of which it then unfolds its own strength while awakening. Immediately, though, we are liable to revel in the strength of our own thinking, therefore unable to properly \u00d2fall asleep\u00d3 into the other thinking again. A proper rhythm must develop between one\u00d5s own thinking activity and devout, dedicated listening. When that happens, the conversation can rise into a shared realm of spiritual and soul intimacy. This kind of conversation nourishes souls. It constitutes the building material out of which social art arises. It is, however, possible that the development of our self-centered thinking (our intellectuality) weans us so radically from the surrounding world that we are no longer able to assimilate foreign thoughts through the sense of thought. It is not surprising that, in an age of \u00d2cool\u00d3 self-centeredness, the willingness to \u00d2fall asleep\u00d3 into the thoughts of another person, to think them as if they were our own, declines considerably. Here a certain unity with the surroundings still protects the child, as it can\u00d5t do otherwise than experience the thoughts around it most intently, long before it is able to think them independently. The adult, in particular after having undergone an intellectual training (and who has not in this day and age?), is in danger of shutting himself up in his own thoughts to the degree that his disposition as a truly social being wanes. He then constantly expresses his own thoughts; when he doesn\u00d5t express them, he thinks them. He is no longer capable of truly listening. When strengthening your own thinking, it is likewise necessary to strengthen the other pole: devotion toward what is not \u00d2I.\u00d3 Only then can the anti-social nature of exercising judgment be integrated into the social organism. Devotion towards the other being is in particular nurtured by deliberately silencing one\u00d5s own thinking, no matter how wise it may be; otherwise it is like light reflecting on the surface of water, impeding sight from penetrating into the water\u00d5s depths. We develop full individuality by lucidly and willfully strengthening our thinking. Consciously caring for developing devotion towards other people builds community. These two poles are interdependent: the deeper we penetrate one, the deeper we can enter into the other. Neglecting one weakens both: If we spin ourselves into the cocoon of self-referential thinking, the sense of thought becomes obscured and can no longer take in foreign thoughts. How Do We Perceive Concepts While Reading? Under which circumstances is a thought a perception of the concept (or thought) sense; under which circumstances does it originate in one\u00d5s own thinking or memory? This question was asked and dealt with in the first part of this essay regarding the nature of listening. Is reading different from listening in this regard? How do we perceive concepts while reading? We can speak of sense perception \u00d2whenever cognition comes about without involvement of reason, memory, and so forth.\u00d3 18 Rudolf Steiner proposes precisely this necessary condition to delineate sense perception when introducing the sense realm beyond the sense of hearing in the fragment of his book Anthroposophy.Detlef Hardorp 3334 Running Head Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 Now while reading, I am constantly dependent on my reasoning mind; without it, I would experience mere words and not understand the weaving of thoughts behind them. It is only through the power of my own thinking and mental representations that I can perceive thoughts when reading. T o be sure, I form these thoughts based on the sense perception of what is written; however this does not mean that the thoughts are contained, sense perceptibly, in what is written. When reading a book, I can work myself through to thoughts only by means of a lucid mind that is capable of thinking. Here the perception of thoughts is supersensible. Exactly the opposite is the case when perceiving via the sense of concept (or sense of thought or thinking): I can perceive nothing through this sense while my reasoning mind stays awake. In order to perceive the thoughts of my fellow human beings in their immediacy, my own reasoning mind must be willing to fall asleep, so that during the act of perception via this sense I can live devotedly within the thinking power of the other. Rudolf Steiner once characterized the field of perception of the sense of thinking as follows: ...When I perceive a word, I do not as intimately connect with the object or with the external being as when I perceive the thought through the word. At this stage, most people cease to make any distinctions. But there is a distinction between perceiving the word, the meaningful sound, and the veritable perception of the thought behind the word. You can also perceive a word, after all, when it has been separated from the thinker through a phonograph or even through writing. However, while in a living connection with the being who is forming the word, to transpose myself directly through the word into the thinking and mentally representing being, this requires a sense that goes deeper than the usual word sense, this requires the sense of thinking, as I would like to call it. And an even more intimate relation to the outer world than through the sense of thinking is given to us through that sense which enables us to feel with another being in such a way as to feel at one with this being, to sense it as one senses oneself. That is the sense of I: through the thinking, the living thinking which the other being turns towards me, I perceive the \u00d2I\u00d3 of this other being. 19 \u00d2Word\u00d3 and \u00d2thought\u00d3 should not be taken too literally. In the sense of Steiner, the realm of perception of the sense of tone 20 or word encompasses all of human body language, including all expressed gestures of the soul insofar as they are perceived in their immediacy. 21 Facial expressions of a human being also show the stirrings of the soul, including the person\u00d5s thinking, which can be perceived by the sense of thought accordingly; insofar as the \u00d2I\u00d3 comes to expression in the soul, it can be perceived by the sense of \u00d2I.\u00d3 Being together in silence with another human being can thus also provide a field of perception for these three upper senses. 22 The sense of concept enables one to \u00d2delve into another being ... through sensing what lives in that being as concept.\u00d3 23 When (sensorially) delving into another \u00d2I,\u00d3 first its stirrings of thoughts are perceived (as sense perception), before awakening, enriched, to one\u00d5s own thinking. While reading, the order is reversed: We must first awaken to our autonomous thinking before the thoughts of the other can be perceived (now super-sensibly!). When I read what has been written in a book, I face someone else\u00d5s thoughts in a similar way to the manner with which I face nature. I realize: Reading thus becomes the starting point of a conscious advance into the supersensible worlds 34 Thinking and the Sense of Thinking: How We Perceive Thoughts Running Head 35 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 Here beings acted creatively, but I myself face only the accomplished work. These condensed gestures allow me to surmise that this work arose out of life-imbued creativity. However, within the realm of sense perception, I can never reach the creative beings because they themselves are no longer present in the condensed gestures of the accomplished work that I behold. In the written text, the complete content is there; I must simply learn to read it. I can learn to read it only by exercising my thinking activity, so that it itself forms the language. While reading, I retrace the gestures inwardly and experience their movement. The willing activity of my thinking must make them flow so that my thinking can grasp the unifying impulse of the movement\u00d1the un-manifest thought. While reading, I am not on a par with a thinker. I am confronted with mere letters\u00d0\u00d0dead, petrified signs of former thinking activity; I break through to the thinking activity, which condensed itself into these letters and words, only when, out of my own willful thinking, I cause the words to flow again and thereby the thoughts to resound. \u00d2The reader comprehends because he himself fills the given text with meaning. ...And not only does thinking make connections, but a power which arguably gives thinking its impulse to do so: the imagination,\u00d3 writes Michael Bockemhl in his excellent essay \u00d2Reading and Comprehension.\u00d3 24 I understand what I read only to the extent of what I am able to grasp through my autonomous thinking . Apart from that, I can merely parrot words. Do I Read When Listening? Now I can also listen to someone present in an uncommitted fashion by \u00d2reading\u00d3 the words he utters as if they were written in a book, instead of paying attention to his thinking. Persons with a dysfunctional sense of thinking in fact cannot listen in any other way. They hear sequences of words that they then try to connect and to enliven into thoughts out of their own thinking activity. If I listen in this way while the other speaks, I will be able to understand him in a way, although he will never feel understood. The unifying meeting of beings (through the sense for the \u00d2I\u00d3 of the other), for which the percept of the sense of thinking becomes permeable and which resonates with each perception of the sense of thinking, is circumvented when \u00d2reading\u00d3 the words of a speaker, because the sense of thinking is bypassed altogether (which also disables the sense for the \u00d2I\u00d3 of the other). When listening in this way, people do not truly meet. A conversation of this sort is not \u00d2more invigorating than light.\u00d3 25 When listening to audio recorded or radio broadcast language, much more content of perception is given sensorially than while reading: The remote speaker who is transmitted via a loudspeaker conveys his intonation, his cadence of speech, etc., as carrier of a whole world of soul. 26 Through accentuation in the flow of speech, a particular understanding can be induced in the listener. A content so communicated is thus sensorially richer and easier to understand than when read. Precise soul observation will not, however, fail to notice that when listening to someone on the phone or to canned speech, the thoughts of the speaker are not perceived with the same immediacy as when people meet face to face, in spite of an empathy for the other \u00d2I\u00d3 that can still be conveyed purely on the level of phonetic tone. In fact you need to continuously follow the thoughts of the other inwardly in full waking consciousness. It is hardly possible to sensorially \u00d2fall asleep\u00d3 into the thoughts of the other while being spoken to on the phone or when listening to canned speech. A certain relationship of beings can nonetheless occur while telephoning. Sensorially, insofar as the The only source bringing forth thoughts that is also able to manifest its essence in the world of wrought work is the human being.Detlef Hardorp 3536 Running Head Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 \u00d2I\u00d3 of the listener perceives \u00d2a tone coming from the other I\u00d3 and empathetically \u00d2lives in that tone, and therefore in the other I\u00d3 (cf. the quote at the end of the last endnote). Furthermore, a relationship can also connect to an inner image if one carries an inner image of the other human being with whom the indirect communication is taking place. This relationship of beings is not sensorial, however. It arises by turning our attention inward. In case of sense perception through the sense of thinking and the sense of \u00d2I,\u00d3 our attention is outward bound. It is even easier to realize that, within the process of reading, an encounter of beings is not mediated by the human sensory organism, but by our own supersensible thinking and feeling. When reading, I can notice how the thought, which is petrified in the written text, quivers slightly when touched by the will-power of my thinking and so begins to delicately resound within my own thinking. It resounds to the degree that I form the thought anew. The wider my comprehension of the interconnections of inner threads that manifest through the text, the more my own thinking\u00d0\u00d0in the will-quality of the \u00d2I\u00d3\u00d0\u00d0becomes the bearer of the being who created the written work I behold. Reading thus becomes the starting point of a conscious advance into the supersensible worlds of the spirit. Thoughts in a book can, however, be set into such solid clusters of mental representations that they are no longer able to resound. The petrified thoughts have passed under the threshold of possible reanimation. They may never have been alive in the writer himself. In that case only dead mental representations, schematically combined, are rigidly strung together through associations of words. In both cases, my thinking cannot perceive any thoughts. Conclusion The only source bringing forth thoughts that is also able to manifest its essence in the world of wrought work 27 is the human being. Without human thinking as \u00d2the translator that interprets the gestures of experience,\u00d3 28 inorganic nature manifests none of the concepts by which it can be grasped; these concepts\u00d0\u00d0along with all meaning\u00d0\u00d0must arise from within the human being. Organic nature manifests its concepts to the degree that the human being ascends to supersensible perception of these concepts in an act of cognition wherein thinking not only acts as \u00d2translator [of] the gestures of experience\u00d3 but itself becomes experience. 29 The germinating moments of thinking experienced in this way are to be found only in the world of becoming, not in the world of finished form, towards which the human sense organization is directed. The source of perception from which our own thinking wells is intuition. This source is of a supersensible nature. The source of perception for the one and only life of concepts which can express its being in the world of otherwise finished form is the sense organ of the sense of concept or thinking which, directed towards the wrought world, is the source of perception for the germinating moments of thinking of another human being.

Kinesthetic ability gets \u00d2nourishment that pours forth from within\u00d3 through the sense of concept (cf. the lecture by Rudolf Steiner \u00d2Human Spirit and Animal Spirit\u00d3 of Nov.17, 1910). 9. Translation of this and the following quote by Michael Wilson. 10. A concept is individualized by the way it gets mentally represented. As already mentioned, when Rudolf Steiner spoke about the sense of thinking or concept the first time, he also called it sense of mental representation (Vorstellungssinn). Cf. lecture of October 26, 1909 in the \u00d2Anthroposophy\u00d3 lectures. 11. Michael Wilson here uses the word \u00d2overcome\u00d3 (Michael Lipson the word \u00d2suspend\u00d3 in his translation). We have translated the German aufgehoben as \u00d2eliminated.\u00d312. In the eighth lecture of The Study of Man on August 29, 1919, Rudolf Steiner describes the \u00d2vibration of the soul\u00d3 between \u00d2abandon to the other\u00d3 and \u00d2inner defense\u00d3 as basic gestures of the sense of \u00d2I\u00d3 and refers to his characterization of this sense in the new edition of his Philosophy of Freedom. In fact, there he mainly describes the \u00d2vibration of the soul\u00d3 as basic gesture of the sense of thinking. The sense of thinking and the sense of \u00d2I\u00d3 are obviously different aspects of one sense continuum with the same alternating basic gesture. It can be viewed as one sense realm, but also as two. The statement that \u00d2the separation between the two spheres of consciousness is actually eliminated\u00d3 clearly refers to the sense of \u00d2I,\u00d3 which borders on the sense of thinking and resonates within it. Insofar as thoughts are presently being begotten by a thinker, it is always possible to direct the attention more toward the begotten thoughts or toward the begetting thinker. There is thus a gradual transition from the sense of thinking to the sense of \u00d2I.\u00d3 The basic gesture of oscillation between sympathy and antipathy can have very different qualities, even up to the point that the realm of \u00d2I\u00d3 and the realm of the other amalgamate into a common realm, reaching beyond sympathy and antipathy. 13.

The paragraph has been largely retranslated by the author. 20. The German Laut is here translated by \u00d2tone\u00d3 (which should always be thought of as ensouled), and the German Ton by \u00d2sound,\u00d3 consistent with the English translation of Anthroposophy (A Fragment). 21.

The book was translated into English, but the English manuscript was never published. 22.

The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily, a fairy tale. 26. A listener reacts to the articulated structure of words with precisely synchronized movements that correspond to those of the speaker (this is called \u00d2entrainment\u00d3). This was studied by William S. Condon. \u00d2One of the most significant and unexpected results [for Condon as well] of this unique study of the relation between speech and movement was the realization that not only is there a continual and exact coordination of a speaker\u00d5s movements with his or her own speech, but that the listener moves in precise synchrony to the articulatory structure of the speaker\u00d5s speech almost as well as the speaker does.\u00d3 Furthermore, \u00d2no synchronization was found with non-speech sounds. It has also been shown that a two-day-old American infant was capable of entraining to Chinese speech while at the same time not showing a synchrony of movement with tapping sounds and disconnected vowel sounds. These results were also duplicated when tape recordings were used.\u00d3 This is how Peter Lutzker summarizes the experiments of William S. Condon and L.W. Sander, which were published in the magazine Science in 1974. Cf. Peter Lutzker: Der Sprachsinn. Sprachwahrnehmungen als Sinnesvorgang, 1996, S. 44.

A Fragment (p. 205 of the 1996 edition), Steiner delineates the perception of a sound of a lifeless object from an empathetic listening to a phonetic tone from a human being. After a longer exposition, he concludes \u00d2that in the case of human tone, the listener imparts his or her \u00d4I\u00d5 to the \u00d4I\u00d5 of another, while in the case of a sound of a lifeless object, the \u00d4I\u00d5 is imparted only to the sound itself.\u00d3 Prior to this passage, he had written about the mystery of empathy with the \u00d2I\u00d3 of another and described it as follows: \u00d2We sense our own \u00d4I\u00d5 in the \u00d4I\u00d5 of the other. If we then perceive a tone coming from the other \u00d4I,\u00d5 our own \u00d4I\u00d5 lives in that tone, and therefore in the other \u00d4I.\u00d5 \u00d3 27. Steiner, Rudolf.

Most schools incorporate studies into various meetings, and it is generally understood that the study is meant to be a tool for ongoing professional development to deepen the faculty\u00d5s understanding of anthroposophy, of the curriculum, and of children taken individually or as a class. When successful, the study portion of meetings is enlivening and satisfying. All too often, however, the study can fall short of its promised potential. The reading of texts, in particular, feels like a slog through molasses. The hours following the end of school are not ideal for a first encounter with demanding texts, and the discussions, if they happen at all, may not reach far beyond a surface understanding of the material. An unintended consequence of a poor study may be an aversion to the material among the faculty, particularly those who have not previously experienced a fulfilling study during the course of their teacher preparation. Over the past few years, I have had the good fortune to lead studies of basic pedagogical texts (such as Rudolf Steiner\u00d5s Study of Man) and some other anthroposophical literature in various settings. From the successes and failures of these studies, a basic approach has emerged, which I offer here in the spirit of research into effective practices. Study Sequence In the studies I have led with practicing or prospective teachers, we have taken up the text in a sequence of four phases: 1. Summary. Every participant reads (silently) through the text until a theme seems to have been presented more or less fully to the reader. This usually requires reading between one paragraph and two pages. The student (as the participating teacher will from now be designated) then writes a paraphrase of the content of the theme in his/her own words, condensing the text to about 10-20% of its original length. The best summaries are written as if the writer is the original speaker, and not in the third person (not \u00d2Steiner says\u00d3 but the content itself). When done well, this phase by itself is immensely helpful. Rather than \u00d2sleeping into\u00d3 the content, as so often happens when one reads a demanding text, one is forced to move back and forth between reading and thinking, and thinking and writing. This \u00d2breathing\u00d3 rhythm, in as much as it works through the rhythmic system, encourages comprehension to emerge. Further, the summary remains a reference resource for the student who prepared it. Since it is time-consuming, this phase may take a faculty or college several meetings to complete. However, once a section has been summarized, it will not take a student long to pick up the thread of thought when s/he returns to the text. Alternatively, the person leading the study may divide the text into sections (according to themes) ahead of time and assign each participant one section to summarize. In this approach, the group can have the whole lecture or text summarized quickly, but, of course, each person will have read and summarized only a section of the whole. A summary of the first five pages in Balance in T eaching , Lecture 1, is added at the end of this article as a sample. It is not practical to add the original text here, but it can be downloaded for free from the archive section of Steinerbooks.org.40 Outline of a Study Methodology Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #12. Movement of the Themes . Each student identifies (in writing, in the same notebook used for the summary) the main themes of the text s/he previously summarized. Each theme is identified in a few words, following the author\u00d5s sequence. The participants then share their sequences, making changes or additions to their own work if they so desire. It is not necessary for everyone to agree on what should be considered the movement of the themes, but others\u00d5 perspectives can be helpful. A variation on this phase, suggested to me by Douglas Gerwin, has each participant articulate one summary segment while linking his/her summary to the one offered previously by another participant. Now each student tries to \u00d2see\u00d3 the whole text (lecture or section of a book) as a movement of themes. By repeating the series of themes in one\u00d5s mind a few times, a sequence emerges that was previously only dimly sensed. By knowing where the text is \u00d2heading,\u00d3 the student can see connections and thereby learn not only from the details but also from the artistic construction of the text as an entirety. This phase brings the text into movement, giving the student a bird\u00d5s-eye view of the whole. It allows a new mobility to grow in the thinking of each participant. Parts of the text acquire a new significance through their connection with the totality, much as a second reading of a novel gives a context for individual events and personalities that one could have easily missed at the first reading. A conversation at this point is often brimming with new ideas and insights. This phase can also be repeated at the completion of the entire text, so that a similar large viewpoint can grow of how the whole text is, in a sense, one statement. 3. Artistic Transformation. Each student transforms one or all of the themes (depending on how the group wishes to proceed) into an artistic representation. This can be an image, a stanza of poetry, or a visual form (drawing/painting). Poetry and images work particularly well for meetings, since they do not require props or changes in the physical space, but any artistic \u00d2language\u00d3 is fine. (It is entirely conceivable that movement, music, or sculpture work equally well, but I have not experienced those and therefore do not include examples of them here.) This phase calls upon the student to give the ideas within the text a new vestment, incorporating his/her relationship with those ideas more clearly into the foreground. It is usually a lively and energizing step. If each student transforms all of the themes into artistic representations, s/he will have an artistic rendering of an entire lecture. If the group divides the lecture or text so that each student works with one theme, then the group as a whole will have that complete artistic rendering by the end of this process. Groups can be playful with this phase, experimenting with different approaches to keep the surprising and engaging explorations lively. 4. Question Leading to Contemplation. Each participant picks a theme that speaks particularly strongly to him/her, and tries to articulate a genuine question in relation to that theme. It is not easy to find true questions. Seemingly simple ones often work the best. One should avoid asking questions that are meant to set the stage for one\u00d5s knowledge to shine forth and seek instead for those questions that leave the group in an open, not-knowing state. If successful, this phase opens the door to new insights, gained through a period of quiet contemplation. Questions can be held inwardly, captured in a representative word or sound, and then eliminated altogether for short periods, leaving behind a receptive attentiveness as a vessel for new \u00d2drops of light.\u00d3 They can be shared, preferably in a quiet, contemplative mood. The actual contemplation can be undertaken in the group or left for each one to practice at home. If the group has a working relationship with contemplative periods during Running Head 41 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 meetings, then it can take up one theme and have everybody approach it contemplatively at the same time, or have a contemplative period during which each member engages with his/her individual question. As mentioned earlier, this methodology is offered in the spirit of research into effective practices. I welcome reflections or suggestions as to its efficacy. Summary Sample Balance in T eaching, Lecture 1 (pp. 1\u00d05) T eachers must have a deep feeling for the nature of the esoteric. Much of what will make an educator effective has to be guarded as a sacred possession within the circle of the faculty. [It is not to be discussed in public.] Education is concerned with cultivating the three soul forces of the next generation; those have to be prepared for accomplishing the tasks of the future. Humanity brought itself to its present (1920) state of misery because it has made itself dependent on the mode of thinking that originated in the West. Herbert Spencer is a representative of this mode, whose influence on education has led to the precise opposite of what education should entail.Spencer wants the instruction of children to be a preparation for future specialization (as a scientist, e.g.), but that is exactly the worst possible approach to education. Future specialization is in essence a question of talent, that is, of karma. The education of children should be geared towards the essential humanity of all children, not towards the karmic gifts of a few. In fact, a teacher would be educating better if s/he tried to make sure that a child WOULD NOT be able to specialize in a given field of instruction. When a specialized training is considered an appropriate preparation for teaching, then the teacher cuts a comic figure in front of the class. In fact, education should be its own specialty, and training in science is not a preparation for pedagogical work. The confusion between pedagogy and research originated in the universities and has made its way down through the high schools into the elementary schools. Reference Steiner, Rudolf.

If, on the contrary, we could have arranged our lessons so that our way of teaching about plants and animals would hinder the child in question from becoming a botanist or zoologist, then we would have acted more wisely than by following [the scientific] principle, for no one should become a botanist or zoologist through what he learns in grade-school; that he can become only through his special gifts, which are revealed by his choice of vocation and which would be sure to appear during his life if there is a true art of education. Through his gifts! That is, if he has the gifts necessary for a botanist, he can become a botanist; and if he has the gifts necessary for a zoologist, he can become a zoologist. That can only be the result of the gifts of the child in question, which is to say: predetermined karma. This must come about through recognizing that this child has the makings of a botanist and that another child has the makings of a zoologist. It must never be the result of making our grade-school lessons in any way a preparation for special scientific activity. \u00d0 Rudolf Steiner Balance in T eaching SteinerBooks, 2007Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1The Founding Intentions Spiritual Leadership, Current Work, and the Goals of the Medical Section TMichaela Gl \u00d6ckler he tasks of the School of Spiritual Science are rooted in what Rudolf Steiner perceived as a \u00d2spiritual influx\u00d3 into the rising tides of materialism during the last third of the nineteenth century: \u00d2A revelation of the spirit was opened up for mankind. Not from any arbitrary earthly consideration, but in obedience to a call resounding from the spiritual world; not from any arbitrary earthly consideration, but through a vision of the sublime pictures given out of the spiritual world as a modern revelation for the spiritual life of mankind\u00d1from this flowed the impulse for the anthroposophical movement. This anthroposophical movement is not an act of service to the earth. This anthroposophical movement in its totality and in all its details is a service to divine beings, a service to God. We create the right mood for it when we see it in all its wholeness as a service to God.\u00d3 1 These words state clearly that the founding of the Goetheanum as an independent school for anthroposophy was an initiative that Rudolf Steiner intended to facilitate practical divine service in daily life. Not only those who practice the vocation of priest, but every member of a profession can learn to feel responsible in his or her actions towards a real, divine-spiritual world. Spirituality is not just a matter for religion, but also for science, art, and for how people lead their daily lives. With such an endeavor, Steiner harkens back to the most ancient mystery traditions. The word mysterium, which can be translated as \u00d2secret,\u00d3 denotes the search for a spiritual path and a temple that remained secret until one had found what one sought or strove for. Steiner and his colleagues conceived of the Goetheanum as a place to facilitate such seeking and finding in contemporary times, so that each interested person could find an inner path of development fitting for his profession, fruits of work and study within the specialist Sections of the School would address contemporary issues and foster further cultural development of individuals, and support could be given to collegiate collaboration and community building. Steiner therefore outlines the following tasks of the School at the Goetheanum: \u00d2Since the School of Spiritual Science cannot be a college or university in the normal sense, it will not attempt to compete with these in any way or be a substitute for them. What one will be able to find at the Goetheanum, however, which is not to be found at ordinary universities, is esoteric deepening of knowledge. People will be able to receive there something that the soul seeks in its quest for knowledge. This quest for knowledge can be something universally human. The General Section will exist for those who have only the universally human need to find the paths of the soul towards the world of spirit. The other Sections will endeavor to indicate paths whereby those who wish to orient their lives in accord with a specific scientific, artistic or other vocation can do so. Thus every seeking human being will find at the \u00d4Goetheanum School\u00d5 what he wishes to strive for, depending on the particular circumstances of his life. In other words, the School does not aim to be a purely academic institution, but a purely human one; but at the same time it should be able to fully engage with the esoteric needs of the scientist and the artist.\u00d3 2Rudolf Steiner intended to facilitate practical divine service in daily life.44 The Founding Intentions Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1The Threshold to the Spiritual World Already in a public lecture given in Stuttgart on May 1, 1919,3 Rudolf Steiner states how necessary it is to come to recognize that the thresholds of birth and death are transitions leading into spiritual forms of human existence, to which earthly life is directly related. He describes how a person\u00d5s happiness in life and his capacity to withstand crises are dependent on the extent to which he can become aware of this fact. Those who live in an awareness that the spiritual world\u00d0\u00d0in the form of life after death and before birth\u00d0\u00d0actually exists develop different values and perspectives on earthly life. One learns to live daily life with more mindfulness in all of its details and to acknowledge responsibility for one\u00d5s own actions towards oneself and one\u00d5s guiding spirit. If we do not become aware of this fact, we lose insight into the meaning and purpose of life, as well as into the precious nature of every moment granted us to develop ourselves and our work for others. Cultivating \u00d2threshold consciousness\u00d3 on the other hand, in professional life and in social interaction, awakens each person\u00d5s experience of meaning and sense of responsibility for the developmental context in which he stands and gives life value and orientation. At the same time, much is also \u00d2unveiled\u00d3 in the sense of an \u00d2apocalypse,\u00d3 that is, as revelation. Consciously approaching the spiritual world gives life meaning but it is also a serious matter. It is simultaneously uncomfortable and beautiful, in the same way as are truth and self-knowledge. 4 In the esoteric tradition, the three decisive steps for preparing the conscious individual crossings of the threshold are called the trials by fire, water, and air. 5 Formerly, at the time of the ancient mysteries, these trials or tests could be undergone only in the form of initiation rituals in a temple. T oday, inner and outer circumstances of life require most of us to experience them. Life itself has become a mystery, the meaning and developmental opportunities of which have to be uncovered. The initiation experiences arising from these circumstances pertain to our life of cognition, feeling, and will.\u00a5 In the fire of honest self- and world- knowledge, the self-deception with which one unconsciously wants to protect oneself and others from uncomfortable truths is burned away (the fire trial). \u00a5 In the crisis of trust that very often follows a severe disappointment in oneself or another person, one can experience the quality of the trial by water, in which \u00d2nothing upholds you.\u00d3 In the face of the deep uncertainty associated with this\u00d0\u00d0the falling away of recognition, support, and encouragement from within and without\u00d0\u00d0one can develop further in a healthy way only by deriving one\u00d5s motives for action entirely out of the matter at hand. Personal sympathies can and must fall silent. The love for an action rooted solely in the matter at hand sustains us, even if we are otherwise floundering, without firm ground under our feet. \u00a5 The quality of the trial by air, in contrast, concerns a capacity that the modern human being especially needs if he or she wishes to act in a culturally creative and healing way. Here we must not only educate ourselves to be truthful to ourselves and others (the fire-trial process) and develop a capacity for human understanding or love (the water-trial process), but also, in particular, we need a capacity for moral intuition; 6 we need an ability to make the right decision in the specific situation at hand. For this, courage, tolerance, and unconditional love of freedom are needed. These three new ways of handling thinking, feeling, and will\u00d0\u00d0even if we initially practice them only in a tentative way\u00d0\u00d0make the dynamics of social interaction into a developmental space for all. They are also the capacities or attitudes towards life that connect the spiritual and sensory worlds, facilitating a conscious crossing of the threshold to the spiritual world. Running Head 45 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 Moral Techniques for Social Commitment and the Tasks of the Goetheanum In the face of the social deficiencies that so commonly arise today, it is important to detail the social skills that are required of us: 1. In the spiritual/cultural sphere, we need to develop individualism and personal commitment\u00d1what one might call spiritual entrepreneurship. 2. In the sphere of rights, we need clear structures for reaching agreements and opportunities to reflect on the forms of work in which we are embedded, so that we can optimize them for the benefit of all. 3. In the economic-social sphere, the prime need is for a culture of acknowledgement of what is done, of what each individual can contribute with his or her specific gifts and capacities. When these three primary needs of modern human beings are taken into account, we can meet what is \u00d2difficult\u00d3 in social life in a constructive way. The creative development of all can replace the chaotic drifting apart of individuals\u00d5 intentions. T o initiate a schooling oriented towards this, on December 27, 1923, during the Christmas Conference, Steiner outlined three possible forms of community building\u00d1two with a horizontal structure and one that vertically crosses and connects them. 7 The working forms characterized by horizontal lines are those of the General Anthroposophical Society and the School of Spiritual Science with its three classes (see sketch: I, II, III) of which Steiner himself was only able to establish the First Class in its first division. The \u00d2vertical\u00d3 community building in the Section context is rooted in an inner attitude to accomplish daily work out of spiritual responsibility. This requires the autonomy and fraternal stance that can be learned in the forms of work of the Anthroposophical Society and the School. In the statutes of the General Anthroposophical Society as conceived by Steiner, 8 the working forms of this Society are entirely founded on each individual\u00d5s initiative. Every member is accorded the autonomous right to join a working group or to form a group with others that has a local or thematic focus (GA 260, p. 43). In the School of Spiritual Science, on the other hand, there are no statutes describing the rights and duties of members. Steiner calls this the \u00d2soul of the Anthroposophical Society\u00d3 (GA 260, p. 161). T o become a member of the School, no admission test is required nor is any testimony of one\u00d5s capacity, such as is otherwise normally expected in order to enter a university. Nor is any member\u00d5s contribution stipulated, as is the case in the Anthroposophical Society. Three conditions of entry are given which one affirms\u00d0\u00d0both to oneself and to the School collegium (the group of Section leaders)\u00d0\u00d0that one will strive to fulfill as a binding commitment: \u00a5 T o pursue the anthroposophic path of development independently and with commitment. \u00a5 T o \u00d2stay connected\u00d3 with the other School members. \u00a5 T o be a representative of the anthroposophic cultural impulse \u00d2in all details of life.\u00d3 9 These three conditions give each individual a clear orientation and create the coherence necessary for forming working contexts, or \u00d2communities of free spirits.\u00d3 How Can a Christian Style of Leadership Succeed? On January 1, 1924, at the end of the Christmas Conference for the new spiritual foundation of the Anthroposophical Society and the School, Louis Werbeck expressed the thanks of the participants, calling Rudolf Steiner \u00d2you great, pure human brother\u00d3 and asking him for his \u00d2fatherly blessing\u00d3 for further work in the Anthroposophical Society.Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler 4546 The Founding Intentions Research Bulletin Spring 16 #1 Steiner replied as follows: \u00d2. . . My dear friends, what has taken place here is something, I know, that I was allowed to say, for it was spoken with full responsibility and in upward gaze to the spirit who is there and should be and will be, the spirit of the Goetheanum. In the name of this spirit I have allowed myself to speak things that could not have been uttered so forcefully if not uttered with upward gaze to the spirit of the Goetheanum. And so let me accept these thanks from you on behalf of the spirit of the Goetheanum, for whom we wish to exert ourselves, and strive and work in the world.\u00d3 10 This is at the same time clear acknowledgement of the \u00d2vertical succession\u00d3 in which Steiner included himself as the inaugurator of anthroposophy. As little as he himself wished to receive thanks from others for his work, but rather to pass this on to his source of inspiration, just as little did he value it when people cited his authority in terms of \u00d2horizontal succession.\u00d3 A \u00d2Christian style of leadership\u00d3 takes its lead from the Pauline attitude, \u00d2Not I but Christ in me\u00d3 (Letters of St. Paul). But this is an attitude of \u00d2vertical succession.\u00d3 Anthroposophy aims to be a path whereby the human being achieves independent spiritual knowledge and insight. In the field of science this is possible by spiritualizing thinking and developing it further meditatively. In the artistic sphere, we can do so by drawing on the artistic elements of composition, such as building materials, forms, colors, tones, words, and movements so that spiritual qualities can become manifest. 11 In practical life, on the other hand, as much of this spiritually grasped and longed-for spirit can be realized as individuals are each able to integrate it into their work and the way they live their lives. Of these three forms of manifestation of spiritual realities, art has advanced the furthest. It can fashion images and revelations of what is \u00d2perfect.\u00d3 It is hardly surprising, therefore, that Rudolf Steiner spoke often and in such a moving way about the nature of the Dornach building and its central sculpture, the \u00d2Representative of Humanity.\u00d3 Over nine meters high, the statue shows Christ striding between the powers that seek to divert human beings from their path: Lucifer as the radiant spirit of hubris, and Ahriman as the power-conscious spirit of conformity and de-individualization. Rudolf Steiner\u00d5s sketch explained at the Christmas Conference of 1923/24 to clarify the working forms of the Anthroposophical Society, School of Spiritual Science and the Sections Work of the Research Fellows 47 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 When construction of the first Goetheanum was starting, at the inauguration of the artist studio on June 17, 1914, Steiner said: \u00d2. . . but then, when all is ensouled by this spirit whom I wish to invoke with these words in this room this evening, when everything that rises above this hill through our work is filled with this spirit of love, which at the same time is also always the spirit of authentic art, then from this hill and what stands here there will radiate out into the world the spirit of peace, the spirit of harmony, the spirit of love.\u00d3 12 T o let this spirit inspire us in the realm of medicine and in the organs of the anthroposophic medical movement is the great ideal of anthroposophic medicine. Heart Function as a Guiding Image The guiding picture for the leadership culture of the Goetheanum, in particular for the Medical Section with its therapeutic task, is the heart function of the human being. Steiner confirms this task everywhere in his work, for instance when he says, \u00d2The inmost principle of anthroposophic endeavor is love for the human being.\u00d3 13 \u00d2We can only make what we say and hear into the proper point of departure for the development of the anthroposophic cause if our heart\u00d5s blood is capable of beating for it.\u00d3 14 And, at the end of the Christmas Conference, his words sound like a Whitsun blessing: \u00d2And so, my dear friends, bear your warm hearts, in which you have laid the foundation stone for the Anthroposophical Society, bear these warm hearts into the world for strong, potent and healing work.\u00d3 15 \u00d2And so the heartfelt ties which you can form with the Goetheanum will be something which, especially as physicians, can profoundly help you in the task you have really set yourselves.\u00d3 16 Steiner had a very clear perception of the connection between phenomena of social misery in his time\u00d0\u00d0poverty, the upsurge of racism, abuses of power, violence\u00d0\u00d0and an education that was remote from the spirit, making it inadequate for developing freedom and responsibility. He regarded the social question as a pedagogical one. When the first Waldorf school was founded in Stuttgart, he insisted that education must have a therapeutic orientation that would always serve individual development and focus on the child\u00d5s developing health. Thus the pedagogical question becomes a medical-therapeutic question. Ultimately, though, as Paracelsus saw it, the medical question is the question of the \u00d2only true medicine,\u00d3 love. The human heart perceives in a differentiated way\u00d0\u00d0physiologically, emotionally, and spiritually\u00d0\u00d0what is happening in the organs and systems of the whole organism. It is from the heart that the whole receives its impulses, and every single organ and function receive the heart\u00d5s blood as needed to meet their individual requirements. It is only in the heart that the particular potential, capacities, needs, and stresses of individual organs are reflected, along with the needs of the whole. In the way the heart functions\u00d0\u00d0its archetypal mediation between periphery and center and between the nerve-sense system and the metabolic-limb system\u00d0\u00d0the heart is a profound and archetypal image of a Christian social culture and quality of leadership. Counter-Images of a Humane Approach to Leadership The French revolutionary politician Robespierre stands as a historic example of thinking that, in pursuance of the ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity, lost touch with the heart. Where this occurs, guiding pictures and ideals turn into an ideology in which many become emotionally subordinate and dependent on one charismatic personality\u00d1in spiritual terms on inspirations emanating from Lucifer. Ahrimanic inspirations are at work where this ideological orientation Life itself [is] a mystery, the meaning and developmental opportunities of which [are] to be uncovered.Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler 4748 The Founding Intentions Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1is compounded by the enforcing of will and an external imposition of power and authority. As a result, various types of totalitarian systems and authoritarian styles of leadership arise that are characterized by the use of both ideological and material/practical compulsions as a means of power, including the use of financial shortages to achieve certain goals. Common to both luciferically and ahrimanically inspired social cultures is the greater or lesser restriction of individual freedom to think, hold opinions and act, along with heartless and inhumane elements in relations and agreements. We can protect ourselves against the fascination of Lucifer through love for the realities of life: \u00d2Those who take spiritual science seriously are not concerned with battling about different professions of belief but instead they wish to pursue serious work in all areas of practical life.\u00d3 17 We can protect ourselves against the dangers of Ahriman by respecting each person\u00d5s individual freedom: \u00d2The individual first had to separate from his associations and connections so that the social element could be realized out of the individual.\u00d3 18 Organizing one\u00d5s own modes and structures of work in as conscious and healing a way as possible for social interaction is therefore the core task of the Medical Section and the professional associations and institutions affiliated with it. The Working Principles Conceived by Rudolf Steiner and Their Guiding Image The principle of interlinked collaboration: How can the Anthroposophical Society, the School, the anthroposophic movement, and the public work together constructively? Steiner gave a guiding image for this in the blackboard sketch described above. He described as follows the working attitude necessary for realizing this guiding image: \u00d2It is very important that we acquire the outlook according to which we do not believe we have the right to give people anything other than what they demand, that we do not have a right to place ourselves above others to whom we wish to present or give something. We must rid ourselves of the habit of assuming a didactic or campaigning stance, so that we can really make insight and understanding the founding element of life in the Anthroposophical Society.\u00d3 19 Heart culture lives from insight into needs and necessities. It creates structures and institutions so as to serve these needs and necessities as best as possible. Thus Steiner allows the forms of collaboration he proposes to interpenetrate each other in his sketch of the social structure for the anthroposophical work. The vertical element stands at the center, however, as a fundamental orientation for each individual who feels an obligation towards one or several Section impulses in his work. This vertical element stands for the anthropos, the upright human being, whose insight gives him the strength to turn his heart forces right and left towards various work contexts of anthroposophic life, but also upward to inspiration from the spiritual world, and downward, by standing within the demands of life with all his personal, professional, and social human development. The principle of individuality: In the statutes and statute discussions of the Anthroposophical Society at the Christmas Conference of 1923/24, Rudolf Steiner presented the social structure of the School of Spiritual Science, Anthroposophical Society, and the anthroposophic medical movement in a differentiated way. The Anthroposophical Society is underpinned by a democratic-republican gesture: All members have the right to set themselves goals in a local area or sphere of activity, to found contexts of work and lay down the particular statutes for such an organization. These individual goals and statutes should not contradict those of the Anthroposophical Society. Here the full scope of the principle of individuality applies. Work of the Research Fellows 49 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1The principle of fraternity in spiritual community: The School of Spiritual Science is structured according to the principle of spiritual fraternity: The spiritual bond is formed by three conditions that regulate the various forms of collaboration. The principle of representation and service: The anthroposophic medical movement, like the other Sections, is conceived as a service-providing community. The School of Spiritual Science should focus on making the findings of anthroposophic spiritual research available for fraternal collaboration and community, for moral and religious life, and for artistic and cultural life in general. 20 Central to this is the Rosicrucian maxim: \u00d2An action performed from goodness of heart is one in which the person who performs it does not pursue his own interest but that of his fellow human beings. Such an action can be called morally good.\u00d3 21 \u00d2And at all times complete harmony must prevail between external life and initiation.\u00d3 22 \u00d2Instructions [of good spiritual teachers] lead either to good results or to nothing.\u00d3 23 \u00d2They are concerned with the development and liberation of all beings, both human and companions of human beings.\u00d3 24 The principle of flexible structures: The anthroposophic medical movement, for example, with all its different work contexts, has to adapt continually to growing demands. Where a hierarchy of capacities is needed, this will be set up. Where all are needed and should be involved, democratic arrangements will be made. Otherwise, tasks can be mandated for a defined period, new bodies created, and structures that are no longer needed can be dissolved according to need. All the modes of work developed or suggested by Rudolf Steiner were flexible answers to questions or needs of the time. This principle assures developmental openness, so as to counter stagnation in the social domain and chaotic phenomena of upheaval and dissolution.Meditations for Those Working in the Field of Curative Education and Social Therapy \u00d0 Rdiger Grimm The Curative Education Course contains a series of meditative exercises for deepening one\u00d5s own inner manner of working with questions and problems relating to curative education and the nature of the human being. The point-circle meditation, which stands at the center of these exercises, was first elaborated by Rudolf Steiner close to the end of the course, in lectures 10 and 11. 25 This exercise enables us to meditatively experience and discover the fundamental, polar relationships between the forces which form the human organization and which continually recur as a formative principle in the Curative Education Course. An instance of this can be seen in the polar images of compulsively reproducing the same repeated ideas, on the one hand, and the incapacity, on the other, to recall even the simplest daily experiences. Curative educational insight and deeds thus arise from a process of convergence between external observation, insight into the nature of the human being, the inner recreating and envisaging of constitutional processes, conscious work on the form of relationships, and the development of individual caretaking for people in need of special care. The inner activity involved in the point-circle meditation encompasses several elements by means of which polar experiences can be stimulated and deepened. Practicing it in the evening and morning means that it engages with differing states of consciousness. In the evening a contemplative awareness arises as we recall the past day and release ourselves from its events and experiences, which can now be formed into inner pictures in retrospective review. In the morning, on the other hand, we enter the individual space of our actions, which we are likely to picture in a goal-oriented way, and yet these actions may result and be co-determined by what comes to meet us. The polar situation in which we live can be experienced Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler 4950 Running Head Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 meditatively at the transitions between sleeping and waking. A second polar element is practiced through the form dynamic of point and circle, or through the inner exercise of centripetal and centrifugal movement. In our mind\u00d5s eye the point at the center of the circle expands towards its circumference, while at the same time the peripheral circle element concentrates towards the point center. The linked evocation of blue and yellow likewise accentuates the greatest possible contrast of color spaces\u00d1of space-creating-withdrawing impressions, on the one hand, and emerging-luminous ones, on the other. Two meditative phrases enable us to live into the depth of these processes: to experience the activity that gives rise to consciousness in the evening not just as a reflection of day consciousness but as the presence of a spiritual reality in which divine thoughts can fill human awareness: \u00d2In me is God.\u00d3 In the dawning consciousness of morning, on the other hand, we can experience how, in acting, our will activity touches and affects not only a world of objects but at the same time also a divinely created world in which we encounter each other with our individual destinies and dispositions: \u00d2I am in God.\u00d3 Inner flexibility can arise from ongoing practice of this meditation, harmonizing the transitions between states of consciousness in us: between waking thinking and sleeping will. As a \u00d2professional meditation\u00d3 it enables us to acquire experiences that are, ultimately, indispensable for work in curative education: a schooling of mindfulness, of devotion to the world of the senses and its often unexpected pointers to key opportunities for perceiving another being. It also creates a space for trusting in our own capacity to be able to act with full presence of mind in the moment and for trusting with courage in the hidden dimensions of our own being. 50 The Founding Intentions The point-circle meditation in the Curative Course\u00d1\u00d2In me is God, I am in God.\u00d3 Running Head 51 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 References 1.

Or the human mind? Or an ecosystem? Or for that matter, the educational project itself? We are well schooled in \u00d2seeing them\u00d5\u00d5 into parts\u00d1into brushstrokes, neurons, and molecules\u00d1or seeing the university apart into departments, disciplines, and specializations. What kind of attentiveness will enable us to see a true whole? What is the pedagogy for beholding interconnectedness as a primary reality and not a derived one? What are the implications of a deep experience of interconnection for knowing, teaching, learning, and life? What would be gained if, as the Dalai Lama says, we were to cultivate \u00d2a deep sense of caring for others, based on a profound sense of interconnection?\u00d5\u00d5 1 It is perhaps difficult to appreciate how extensive the changes would be if this integrative viewpoint were fully embraced in higher education. The conventional view that privileges a single reductive perspective is so pervasive that undoing its effects will be difficult, but if we were to succeed, then the fragmentation of our education and our lives would be healed. Simultaneous with our experience of self would be the powerful complementary experience of human interdependence, of what Desmond T utu calls ubuntu: \u00d2I exist because of you.\u00d5\u00d5 Emerging Wholes Since Galileo, science has had a bias towards simplification for the very sensible and practical reason that it was all it could handle. Nothing is wrong with this as long as the limitation of the method is not projected onto reality, limiting it. If all you have is a thermometer, then everything is a temperature. But we now know that analysis of climate, the human nervous system, economics, and ant colonies, to mention only four examples, resists such simplification. T o understand them with any subtlety requires that we embrace their inherent complexity and work with it. Until the last few decades, the exclusive method of studying complex systems was to break them down into fundamental parts and then to connect neighboring parts by means of simple forces. The forces between these distinct parts bind them into wholes. The whole is a mere amalgam of conjoined parts that has no ontological standing of its own. The solar system, in this view, comprises a star (the Sun), planets, asteroids, comets, and the like, all held together by the force of gravity acting between them. The atom likewise consists of a nucleus and surrounding electrons bound together by an electromagnetic force. This lens is then extended to chemistry, biology, and the human being. The parts are considered to be \u00d2real,\u00d5\u00d5 as are the forces that make connections between the parts, but the whole\u00d1be it a mineral substance, plant, animal, or human\u00d1is a kind of chimera. While such a view is useful in many instances, we now know it to be fundamentally mistaken. Two scientific developments\u00d1entanglement and emergence (as well as common sense)\u00d1have made this conception of the world obsolete. Context trumps consistency. The context in which we examine light fundamentally shapes the phenomenal manifestation, as well as our conception of light in that context.H54 Running Head Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 The first breakthrough came when physicists were able to attend to two things at once. This may sound simple, but to simultaneously measure the subtle properties of two or more quantum particles required a significant increase in resources and experimental sophistication. The simplest experiment of this type was first suggested in 1935 by Einstein, Rosen, and Podolsky, 2 but it had to wait until the 1980s for a definitive test. Light not only has the properties of intensity and color, but it can also have an internal orientation. If thought of as a wave, then the vibration can be up and down or side to side. These two different orientations of vibration are called polarizations. When physicists measured the correlations between the polarizations of photon pairs, the patterns in the data could not be explained by any classical conception of light. (The quantity measured is a complex correlation function for the probability of simultaneously detecting two photons at a particular polarization angle relative to one another.) The results were astounding, not because they required a new physical theory (quantum theory was adequate to the task), but because of their ontological implications. Here was a potent metaphysical experiment, and it demonstrated convincingly that the understanding we had of wholes as merely parts juxtaposed and bound together by forces was wrong. In a crucial manner, when two particles interact, they form an inseparable whole and the very attributes by which we would normally distinguish the one from the other become, as physicists term it, \u00d2entangled.\u00d5\u00d5 3 The two particles form a whole that is as real as the parts. Parts are no longer privileged. I think it symbolic that wholes showed themselves only when physicists learned to attend to two things at once. The old practice of attending first to one thing (planet or particle) and then to another fragmented the world into parts. We were unconsciously practicing a particular kind of attention. The universe was and is a whole, but the method by which we chose to observe the universe fragmented it, and we mistakenly assumed our method gave us a true reflection of reality. In the process of learning how to attend to the whole, we learned that the experimental context and our kind of attention are highly significant: They cannot be excluded as inconsequential. As we have seen already, our method of inquiry shapes, in part, only in the phenomena themselves, and it is these phenomena to which we have access. If we attend to separate parts, that is what we see. If we are interested in wholes and devise an experimental method suited to that interest, then wholes show themselves. This is no mere relativism or pure constructivism, but rather an example of the world\u00d5s richness that reveals itself in stages in response to us and our properly posed questions. The best known physics example of the relationship between question and phenomenon is wave-particle duality. If the question we pose is, \u00d2Where is the photon?\u00d5\u00d5 then light shows itself as a particle. If, however, we do not ask, \u00d2Where?\u00d5\u00d5 but allow for an ambiguous trajectory for light, then the resulting observed interference pattern can best be understood in terms of light as a wave. These contradictory manifestations of light\u00d1first particle and then wave\u00d1arise in response to the experimental arrangement, which itself is the embodiment of a question. Classically considered, wave and particle are mutually exclusive concepts, but in quantum mechanics each aspect arises within Scientists now recognize that the qualities that emerge in complex systems are often not able to be reduced to the parts that make up the system. Hydrogen and oxygen are the elemental gases that make up water, but the \u00d2wetness \u00d5\u00d5 of water is an \u00d2emergent property \u00d5\u00d5 of the system not reducible to hydrogen and oxygen.54 Attending to Interconnection: Living the Lesson Running Head 55 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 a distinct measurement context and so it is entirely appropriate to that specific context. Context trumps consistency. The context in which we examine light fundamentally shapes the phenomenal manifestation, as well as our conception of light in that context. The second scientific development that supports the overthrow of reductionism is emergence. If we turn in our imagination to walk along a lively forest stream, or if we listen to a Mozart aria we know well, it seems clear that our life is not made up of atoms and neurons but of a dense, rich array of meaningful experiences. What is the relation between the parts so often at the center of the scientists\u00d5 attention and the experience of wholes that occupy the rest of us? While the fact of quantum entanglement is a principled block to reductionism, a second scientific realization grants added weight to the status of wholes. Briefly put, scientists now recognize that the qualities that emerge in complex systems are often not able to be reduced to the parts that make up the system. Hydrogen and oxygen are the elemental gases that make up water, but the \u00d2wetness\u00d5\u00d5 of water is an \u00d2emergent property\u00d5\u00d5 of the system not reducible to hydrogen and oxygen. In a seminal paper aptly titled \u00d2More Is Different,\u00d5\u00d5 the Nobel physicist Philip Anderson stated, \u00d2At each level entirely new properties appear. ...Psychology is not applied biology, nor is biology applied chemistry. ...We can now see that the whole becomes not merely more, but very different from the sum of its parts.\u00d5\u00d5 4 Nobel physicist Robert Laughlin put it another way: \u00d2We live not at the end of discovery but at the end of Reductionism, a time in which the false ideology of human mastery of all things through microscopics is being swept away by events and reason.\u00d5\u00d5 5 Reductionism is, indeed, a false ideology. While we surely learn a great deal by attending to microscopic parts, we must be careful not to fall in love with the myopic view that mode of analysis offers. We must complement it with an equal attention to relationships and wholes. Only then will we truly behold the painting, appreciate the mind, and understand the complex reality that is the ecosystem. Only then can we arrive at a pedagogy that sees students as whole and complex beings and educates students with an eye to this reality. In summary, I have used science to expand our worldview beyond a reductive materialist ontology in two ways. 6 First, Einstein\u00d5s relativity and quantum mechanics both undermine objectification and support a relational view of reality in which phenomena are co-created by the observer and the world. Second, through entanglement and emergence, physics offers evidence for an ontological holism that grants wholes a standing long denied them. Parts are no longer privileged. These two realizations are essential to a proper philosophical infrastructure for higher education. Pedagogies of Experience and Interconnection Nearly every subject area in the academy has attempted to make itself over into a \u00d2science\u00d5\u00d5 by adopting its own version of the worldview and methods of the old physics of objectification and disconnection. Along the way, the education of the whole human being in community and the cultivation of his or her humanity seem to be increasingly forgotten for the sake of scientific simplification. If we take Laughlin and others seriously, then these fields need to reconceive themselves according to a postreductionist paradigm in which lived experience, connection, and complexity are given far more attention. Every field will also benefit from adopting ways of teaching and learning that are in closer alignment with the relational and integrative view of reality we now possess. In this regard, consider economics, health care, and medical education. Economics has long objectified the human being, reduced to an idealized homo economicus, a hypothetical rational actor who maximizes his or her utility function (which mathematically represents the preferences of the consumer). In Arthur Zajonc 5556 Running Head Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 addition, our relationships to fellow members of our community are reduced to the limited concept of the market. With these two abstractions of the human being and communal relations, economics performs its analysis. While a useful formal model, classical economic theory of this kind has come in for heavy criticism and much modification. As in physics, the simplifying assumptions of classical economics were made because economic theory could not handle the complexities of the real world. But are humans really rational economic actors? Economics experiments show we are not. Understanding this opens us to other important questions to consider, such as, Is market behavior the only or best way to gauge preferences, or might we allow for thoughtful, patient introspection concerning the root causes of suffering and happiness? Does the market really offer an accurate and comprehensive valuation of community, or might we allow for forms of fellowship that elude economic objectification? In economics as in other fields, the limitations of its methods are projected onto reality, truncating our image of self and community in ways that ultimately are not only wrong but pernicious. Real people and their lives disappear behind the equations, and the densely interconnected world in which we live is replaced by a more tractable limited system of competing individuals and corporations that produce and consume. Objectification and impersonal economic transactions come to not only dominate our models but also infect our views of each other and the natural world. The failure of traditional economics to account for what are called \u00d2externalities\u00d5\u00d5 is a symptom of its tragic neglect of the interconnectedness we have been considering. For example, the additional health and environmental costs caused by the pollution associated with production are \u00d2externalized,\u00d5\u00d5 which is to say they are not borne by manufacturers but by the populace and the environment. Impacts on the environment and community are obvious if one has a worldview that acknowledges the dense interconnections between human activity, environment, and health. Instead, classical economics neglects them. \u00d2Ecological economics\u00d5\u00d5 or \u00d2natural capitalism\u00d5\u00d5 is an emerging alternative to classical economics that explicitly rejects the way in which neoclassical theory treats externalities. 7 The critique goes deeper. In his book The Dismal Science, Harvard professor of economics Stephen Marglin characterizes economics as \u00d2hobbled by an ideology in which these tensions [between individual and whole, between self-interest and obligation to others, between material and spiritual health] are replaced by a set of pseudo-universals about human nature.\u00d5\u00d5 8 Doing so simplifies the modeling but at great cost. Marglin goes on to provide a foundational critique that reaches beyond the inclusion of externalities to the very ways in which community\u00d1necessary to a good life\u00d1is systematically undermined by markets that replace personal ties with impersonal market transactions. He shows that the effects of this process on well-being and the quality of life are large and negative. Further problems arise in economics because of its impoverished view of the human being. Two examples will help make clear what I mean. The first is the Ultimatum Game, which economic researchers are now using to explore the limits of the basic assumptions of neoclassical economics, those assumptions being that homo economicus always acts rationally and in his or her own self-interest. 9 In this model, emotions, altruism, fairness, community, and so on have no real place in the economic calculations. In In economics as in other fields, the limitations of its methods are projected onto reality, truncating our image of self and community in ways that ultimately are not only wrong but pernicious56 Attending to Interconnection: Living the Lesson Running Head 57 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 the Ultimatum Game I receive a day\u00d5s wages from someone with the condition that I give you some portion of what I received. If you keep the portion I give you, then the division of money between us is settled. If you do not keep the portion given, then both of us forfeit the money. According to standard economic calculations, since something is always better than nothing, you will keep whatever amount I give you, otherwise you (and I) lose the money. T aking whatever is given is the rational, self-interested thing to do. Experiments show, however, that in all cultures if the amount given is below about 25 percent, you will refuse the offer. Irrational factors or violations of self-interest are at play. 10 Why are we not surprised by the result? Because we too would reject a demeaning offer, no matter what the economists say. The second recognized failure of neo-economic theory is the \u00d2tragedy of the commons.\u00d5\u00d5 Our survival as a species depends fundamentally on such common resources as air that is suitable to breathe, water that can be drunk, fish in the sea, soil that will grow crops, and so on. But if fishermen, farmers, and other workers act rationally and purely in their self-interest, then the neoclassical economic calculation predicts the collapse of fish stocks, the disappearance of water, and so on. Without someone acting on behalf of everyone, without a selfless sense for the whole, the tragedy of the commons will take place. But societies do step back and regulate fishing, water rights, and air quality on behalf of the community and future generations. Such acts as these are not part of the traditional economic calculus. The significance of this failure was recently underscored by the Nobel Prize committee when they awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics to Elinor Ostrom for her work on the tragedy of the commons. With these and other groundbreaking economic studies in behavioral economics, wellness studies, and game theory, we are beginning to see the incursion of a more phenomenological and nonreductive approach to the understanding of people\u00d5s economic life. Through these approaches the actual economic behavior of human beings is studied instead of presumed or idealized behavior. These are complemented by psychological and neuroscientific studies, which are also opening new ways of thinking about economics. Enlarging our view of the human being and enriching our relations to the world we inhabit will change not only the content of our courses but our pedagogy as well. Three examples can stand for many. At the University of Southern Maine, professor of economics Vaishali Mamgain offers a course on neoclassical economics and happiness in which she not only reviews research on this topic but asks her students to work reflectively with questions such as these: What are the causes and conditions that make you happy? Who is it that is experiencing happiness? Are happiness and pleasure the same thing? Political philosopher David Kahane at the University of Alberta draws his students into the deep moral issues around allocation of resources by asking students to examine their own choices. With great sensitivity, he then invites them to view in a sustained way the image of an African mother burying her child who has died from an entirely preventable illness. Kahane notes that the cost of a latt\u008e is equal to rehydration therapy for five children. Both Mamgain and Kahane seek to join textbook material with the experiences and inner observations of their students. Students are explicitly asked to bring themselves into the material and to offer thoughtful comments based on introspection. Frank Maddox is an award-winning economics professor at Oxford College of Emory University who teaches in a similar way. He uses a variety of strategies to make vivid the realities of poverty and wealth, industrial and craft production, and consumption. For instance, after his students have studied standard economic theory in which consumers are modeled as maximizing utility, he Arthur Zajonc 5758 Running Head Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 gives them an unusual assignment. They are asked to go to a store like Wal-Mart\u00a8 or McDonald\u00d5s\u00a8 and note the expressions, actions, and so on of the people there. Students are to observe, without judgment, anything that will help them gauge the degree of consciousness shoppers give to what they are doing. Then Maddox asks the students to observe themselves in the same way, again without judgment. How attentive are they to what they are doing at any moment? What would it mean for us if we were more aware of our consumption? He calls it mindful consumption, and he asks what it might mean to replace maximizing utility with mindful consumption. At the end of the semester Maddox\u00d5s economics students all present their Interbeing Projects. Interbeing is a term taken from the Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh that emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things. Students select a consumer good or service and then research some aspect of its production, becoming more conscious of their connections and responsibilities to it. Maddox teaches economics not only with interconnectedness in mind but as an experience for his students. In the same vein, author Daniel Goleman in his book Ecological Intelligence makes a compelling case for the huge environmental and social benefits that would occur if we practiced mindful consumption, especially when the technologies become available to support us in this practice at the point of purchase. 11 For example, in an early version of such a technology, the foundation Nature & More rates hundreds of products and profiles producers and their social and environmental practices, all available on its website. As the second example of the benefits of the relational and integrative view of reality, consider health care and medical education. In the United States, our approach to medicine has increasingly become a reductive science married to a for-profit economic model that is fast approaching collapse. The questions of the quality of care for the whole person and the education of the whole physician seldom rise to the top of the agenda. Instead, cost analyses and technique pervade the system and threaten to overwhelm the idealistic motives that draw most medical and nursing students to the profession. At every step, caring for those who are ill and suffering is made increasingly difficult by a system at odds with itself. I hardly need describe the dangers of a truncated biomedical model that sees the human being purely as a collection of organs, blood levels, and test results. Good medical education and health care do not require such a view; in fact, it seems obvious that a fully integrative view is called for. For several years I taught an interdisciplinary course that studied, among other topics, the human body in art and science. We worked equally with the anatomical drawings of Leonardo da Vinci and the scientific study of the heart by Andreas Vesalius and William Harvey. The capstone experience was a trip to the anatomy lab of the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, which was run by the remarkable teacher and anatomist Sandy Marks. When Marks first began teaching, anatomy classes had historically been taught as a grisly, even macabre, boot-camp experience. Early on he noted that some of his best students were dropping out of medical school as a result. His own sensibilities, as well as conversations with students in his class, led him to a total overhaul of the gross anatomy class. Now the first day of class begins with readings and conversations about death. For many students the cadaver they will dissect is their first direct encounter with mortality. It often raises fears and memories of those they have lost. Marks makes time and space for these recollections and feelings. He then introduces the students to their \u00d2first patient.\u00d5\u00d5 No longer taken from the state\u00d5s unclaimed dead, each body has been donated to the medical school, some coming with personal letters or poems expressing the wishes of the deceased. He read one to us: \u00d2May that life force that ran in me shine forth once more and pass to you the knowledge and the power that help sustain the miracle of life.\u00d3 12 In this class, each medical student takes the body apart layer by layer, learning its 58 Attending to Interconnection: Living the Lesson Running Head 59 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 miracles, but now it is done with respect and ever mindful of the gift. At the conclusion of the class, relatives of the deceased are invited to a closing ceremony in the medical school courtyard at which the students express in words, music, and poetry their deep gratitude for the gift of the body they studied. Sandy Marks passed away in 2002. The last group of students he taught composed and read this poem at his memorial service: 13 I sat in tears and you told me about dying. I watched in horror as you took the death from another\u00d5s body. I lost myself on my way to your office, but when I got there, you had found me. Knowledge, you offered us. Humor, you provided for us. Humanity, you required of us. Stability, you granted us. Instant, unwavering stability. We watched, listened, spoke, heard, laughed, feared, cried, refused, overcame, denied, and responded. And with a wink and a nudge of your elbow, you calmed the eruption of emotional chaos. We learned. And with a wink and a nudge of your elbow, you made it clear why. \u00d0 Nicole LeBoeuf, UMMS Class of 2006 Our day at the anatomy lab recapitulated in miniature the medical school experience, from the meeting with death and dissection to the conversations about loss and love. It was an amazing and moving experience for our Amherst College students, one they never forgot. They experienced a profoundly ethical form of education in which knowing and caring were united. In pedagogies of experience and interconnections, we are often challenged by the worldview and values of those we meet. Those we meet can think, feel, and act so differently than we do. Such experiences awaken us to our own culture, mores, and behavior, and this is especially so when our engagement with other communities is in service to them. In response to a request from us, Alma Blount describes an educational program that connects communities and the classroom in important ways. Working with people who hold conflicting values in a democratic society brings the realities of leadership and politics to life. Service Opportunities in Leadership (SOL), sponsored by the Hart Leadership Program in the T erry Sanford Institute of Public Policy at Duke University, is an intensive yearlong program for undergraduates that combines academic study, service to communities, and critical reflection. In writing about the program, Blount asks her students rhetorically, What are the highest goals of this class? Informed by scholarship and the ideas of your classmates, you will arm yourself emotionally and intellectually to enter a new culture prepared to serve and to reflect critically on your experience there. We will ask you to think deeply about how to approach the inevitable value conflicts you will face as you cross the borders of new organizations and cultures. We will ask you to examine your own religious and cultural values and preconceptions. We will challenge you to explore how you can, over time, become a fully engaged citizen of your own society. Alma Blount\u00d5s effort is another example of how we can deepen learning in the classroom through experiences beyond its walls. The solitude of specialization often reflects a wider disconnection from others. Classroom culture reinforces that disconnection, not only between teacher and student but also between studentsArthur Zajonc 5960 Running Head Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 Interdisciplinarity and Intentional Teaching We can choose the way we teach. The teachers profiled in this chapter have each sought ways to give body and soul to the otherwise abstract concepts and depersonalized practices of their discipline. They have sought ways of inviting students to make use of their own experiences by pausing to quietly question, reflect, feel, and write. As the students go on to become engaged citizens, doctors, economists, and even consumers, that habit of pausing, reflecting, honoring, and acting morally will serve them and our society. Sandy Marks and his students reformed their anatomy lesson, making the laboratory at once an educational and a sacred space that welcomed all of who they were: body, mind, and spirit. Might we not do likewise? When we do, the ripples are likely to go far beyond our individual classrooms. Is it any accident that Jon Kabat-Zinn began his revolutionary work in mindfulness-based stress reduction down the hall from Sandy Marks? Every bold integrative initiative in higher education will find its echo because we are in the company of others who will respond in their own unique way to our honest efforts at cultivating humanity. In recent decades another way of striving to innovate in higher education has been through efforts at interdisciplinary teaching and research. Those involved have sought to bring disparate areas of learning together to illuminate each other, and much has been gained in the process. I have relished the many interdisciplinary courses I have taught over thirty years with colleagues from across the campus: Romanticism and the Enlightenment, The Imagined Landscape, Eros and Insight, to name a few. These courses brought me together with brilliant scholar-teachers from whom I learned and was enriched. In such classes students saw firsthand the ways in which every issue begs to be addressed from multiple directions. Few issues are adequately treated from a single disciplinary perspective, and the lively engagement of two or more colleagues who tackle an issue, text, or historical period demonstrates this truism again and again. While interdisciplinary teaching brings much to learning, it is not by itself necessarily truly integrative. Most often it is a case of simple juxtaposition. The scholars each bring their expertise and place their contribution beside that of their colleagues. The students are left with the difficult task of synthesizing the parts into a whole on their own. For these classes to be truly integrative, faculty need to exemplify integrative understanding through the ways in which they connect diverse fields into a comprehensive integrated whole. For example, Princeton psychologist Daniel Kahneman was awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics for his development of prospect theory, which concerns decision making in the face of risk. Kahneman made a seminal contribution to economic theory without ever taking a single course in the field of economics. He and his colleagues worked across disciplinary boundaries, bringing psychology and economics into a profoundly fruitful integration. Harvard Nobel economist Amartya Sen has reached out the other way to include a very wide range of non-economic factors into his economic analysis, including individual and societal values, human development, and the rights of individuals. Originality does not respect disciplinary divisions. Each semester students take courses across the curriculum, especially if they are in liberal arts colleges, that support a broadbased education. They should be encouraged to bring all of who At first, love seems to have little to do with knowledge and our understanding of how it works, but if we set aside romantic love for the moment, is it not true that we come to know best that which we love most?60 Attending to Interconnection: Living the Lesson Running Head 61 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 they are and what they know into each class. When in a literature class studying, for example, Keats\u00d5s conception of \u00d2negative capability\u00d5\u00d5 (\u00d2when man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason\u00d5\u00d5 14), students might well draw on understandings and experiences of this capacity from areas as diverse as psychology, religious studies, quantum logic, and Goedel\u00d5s incompleteness theorem. Poets are not the only ones who deal in uncertainties, mysteries, and doubts. With this simple realignment, we shift our focus from the technical understanding of a literary reference to students\u00d5 whole learning; we thereby become interested in students in their entirety not merely as budding literary scholars. Cross-disciplinary initiatives are needed if we are to prepare our students to meet the real problems our society faces. No one field has all the answers because real issues possess multiple dimensions. By welcoming the whole student into our classes, unfamiliar aspects of who they are and what they care about suddenly come into view. What are the heartfelt questions they struggle with? Are they too scared to acknowledge the hopes and aspirations they harbor for their lives and for this world? If they fail to voice them in the safety of a college classroom, will they ever dare to live their aspirations later? And what if we would reciprocate by revealing unfamiliar aspects of ourselves? T oo often we hide in our specializations when, in fact, our interests, experiences, hopes, and understandings are far broader than we let on. In brief, we should do far more to support both students and faculty who strive to combine depth of knowledge in a special area with breadth and integration. Working with such contradictory intellectual gestures may well be the hallmark of great innovation, and our pedagogies should strive to foster the capacity to sustain and use contradictions to their fullest. The solitude of specialization often reflects a wider disconnection from others. Classroom culture reinforces that disconnection, not only between teacher and student but also between students. Patricia Owen-Smith wondered why \u00d2life in the academy has been consistently alienating and lonely\u00d5\u00d5 for her. Gradually she came \u00d2to understand that the academic world of higher education has been structured in such a way so as to normalize and promote alienation. Under the guise of academic freedom and professional autonomy, we close our classroom and office doors physically and metaphorically.\u00d5\u00d5 Upon realizing this, Owen-Smith set about changing the culture of her classroom. In her case, she introduced a period of listening to music at the start of each class, with the encouragement to be still and to \u00d2go within.\u00d5\u00d5 She felt awkward at first, but slowly the students warmed to the innovation, bringing in their own music and appreciating the time of stillness and the journey within. In her description for us, Owen-Smith writes: As we neared the end of the semester the structure of the class had changed from a group of individuals reluctantly gathered together for study to a community of friends and partners who were creating a space of introspection, quiet, and respect for the process of study and the development of self. ...It has been a decade since this initial introduction of contemplative music and I cannot envision a classroom without music. Semester after semester, I watch with delight as we take a journey together, a journey whereby we hear our souls, breathe in silence, cherish stillness, and learn from one another in the most enduring ways. Our journey is a dance, a conversation, a celebration of the heart, and a sacred moment in the process we call \u00d2education.\u00d5\u00d5 With each additional view of a landscape, we enrich our appreciation of its character and beauty. With each added intimacy, we come to know a person better and more fully. No one view contains the whole truth, but by moving among and between Arthur Zajonc 6162 Running Head Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 a myriad of them we may gain an intimation of a truth which lies forever beyond our grasp. Such is the living work of integrative teaching and learning to which the university in its entirety should be dedicated. Such synthetic efforts need to be supported within our universities and colleges. Y et if they are truly integrative, they may well be contrary to the traditional departmental structure of the academy, whose power and reluctance to change we should not underestimate. Much would be gained by fostering a university culture that simultaneously values disciplinary specialization and truly integrative research and teaching. That is, while we rightly value the specialized knowledge of each separate discipline, we should give encouragement to scholars who step outside their specialization to integrate novel areas into their research and teaching. T o this end, we need to find ways to promote conversations around issues that draw together diverse voices, viewpoints, and competencies. We recognize that starting such conversations requires boldness. Enriching Epistemology, Fostering Imagination The wish to comprehend leads us to develop methods of inquiry directed toward reliable knowledge. If the methods we possess are fragmentary or partial, then our knowledge will be likewise. In this way we see that an expanded ontology requires an enriched epistemology. The richness of the world will not reveal itself by a single means of inquiry. Not only are many questions required, but they must be posed and explored in different ways, each one of which illuminates the world from another direction, inner as well as outer. Let us return to and dwell a little longer on the illusive human capacity of imagination so central to a vital and genuine university. Ralph Waldo Emerson described imagination as profoundly participatory: a knowing by becoming. \u00d2Imagination,\u00d5\u00d5 he wrote, \u00d2is a very high sort of seeing, which does not come by study, but by the intellect being where and what it sees.\u00d5\u00d5 15 The intellect of the inquiring individual shifts the locus of its activity from itself into the other. Through imagination, the mind finds a way of living for a time beyond itself, becoming \u00d2where and what it sees.\u00d5\u00d5 As Palmer has already mentioned, Evelyn Fox Keller characterized biologist Barbara McClintock\u00d5s method as \u00d2learning by identification\u00d5\u00d5 so that the object she was studying (maize) became a subject. 16 The epistemology of imagination rejects objectification and distancing and instead practices what we might term subjectification and intimacy. This is McClintock\u00d5s \u00d2intimacy that does not annihilate difference.\u00d5\u00d5 It is a patient, contemplative method that seeks \u00d2to hear what the material has to say to you,\u00d5\u00d5 and through which one achieves \u00d2a feeling for the organism.\u00d5\u00d5 In an address to young Harvard biology students, McClintock urged them to \u00d2take the time and look,\u00d5\u00d5 but as her biographer Keller rightly commented, today \u00d2the pace of research seems to preclude such a contemplative stance.\u00d5\u00d5 Y et it is precisely this contemplative stance that is essential to an integrative and imaginative education within our contemporary culture of teaching and learning. For these reasons I view the practice of contemplative inquiry as an essential modality of study complementary to the dominant analytic methods now practiced in every field. 17 I see contemplative inquiry as the expression of an epistemology of love that is the trueheart of Expanding our ontology and enriching our epistemologies in the ways I have indicated is, in my view, a requirement for any future philosophy of education that will give us the integrative education our students and our world sorely need.62 Attending to Interconnection: Living the Lesson Running Head 63 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 higher education. Epistemology means \u00d2theory of knowledge,\u00d5\u00d5 or how we know what we know. At first, love seems to have little to do with knowledge and our understanding of how it works, but if we set aside romantic love for the moment, is it not true that we come to know best that which we love most? T o make this method clearer, I will distinguish seven stages in the epistemology of love. The first stage is respect. We cannot take the ethical orientation of research for granted. We should consciously adopt a positive ethical orientation toward our object of study. What is the quality and character of our interest in what lies before us? Do we respect the integrity of the other, be it a poem, a plant, or a patient? In his Letters to a Young Poet, Rilke suggested that the highest we can offer another is to \u00d2stand guard over their solitude. 18 When we truly respect the integrity of the other, we \u00d2border and protect\u00d5\u00d5 them, Rilke suggested, even while we seek to know them more completely. The second stage is gentleness. In his own scientific investigations, the poet Goethe, like McClintock, sought to practice what he called a \u00d2gentle empiricism [zarte Empirie].\u00d5\u00d5 19 If we wish to approach the object of our attention without distorting it, then we must be gentle. By contrast, the empiricism of Francis Bacon spoke of extracting nature\u00d5s secrets under extreme conditions, of putting her to the rack. An epistemology of love rejects such methods. The third stage is intimacy. Conventional science distances itself from nature and, to use Erwin Schroedinger\u00d5s term, objectifies nature. 20 Under this view, science disengages itself from phenomena for the sake of objectivity. Contemplative inquiry, by contrast, approaches the phenomenon delicately and respectfully, but it does nonetheless seek to become intimate with that to which it attends. We can still retain clarity and balanced judgment close-up, if we remember to exercise restraint and gentleness. The new science makes clear the implications of such intimacy in its account of observation. The fourth stage is vulnerability. In order to know, we must open ourselves to the other. In order to move with and be influenced by the other, we must be confident enough to be vulnerable, secure enough to open ourselves to the being and becoming of the unknown. A dominating arrogance will not serve. We must learn to be comfortable with not knowing, with ambiguity and uncertainty. Only from what may appear to be weakness and ignorance can the new arise. The fifth stage is participation. Gentle and vulnerable intimacy leads to participation in the unfolding phenomenon before us. Outer characteristics invite us to go deeper. We move and feel with the natural phenomenon, text, painting, or person before us, living out of ourselves and into the other. Respectfully and delicately, we join with the other, while maintaining full awareness and clarity of mind. In other words, an epistemology of love is experientially centered in the other, not in ourselves, in Emerson\u00d5s language \u00d2the intellect being where and what it sees.\u00d5\u00d5 Our usual preoccupations, fears, and cravings work against authentic participation. The sixth stage is transformation. The last two characteristics, participation and vulnerability, lead to a patterning of ourselves on the other. What was outside us is now internalized. Inwardly we assume the shape, dynamic, and meaning of the contemplated object. We are, in a word, transformed by experience in accord with the object of contemplation. The individual is developed, or we could say is sculpted, through the above practices. The lineage of education as transformation dates back to at least as far as the Greeks. In his book What Is Ancient Philosophy? the French philosopher Pierre Hadot writes that for the Arthur Zajonc 6364 Running Head Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 ancient philosopher, \u00d2the goal was to develop a habitus, or new capacity to judge or criticize, and to transform\u00d1that is, to change people\u00d5s way of living and seeing the world.\u00d5\u00d5 21 Simplicius asked, \u00d2What place shall the philosopher occupy in the city? That of a sculptor of men.\u00d5\u00d5 Or as Merleau-Ponty has put it, we need to relearn how to see the world. 22 In an essay on science, Goethe gave voice to a potent pedagogical principle: \u00d2Every object well-contemplated opens a new organ of perception in us.\u00d5\u00d5 23 Echoing Goethe\u00d5s view while commenting on McClintock, Evelyn Fox Keller remarks that \u00d2a motivated observer develops faculties that a casual spectator may never be aware of.\u00d5\u00d5 24 The innate capacities for imaginative cognition that are everyone\u00d5s common inheritance are animated and developed through the patient practice of an epistemology of love. The seventh stage is imaginative insight. The ultimate result of contemplative engagement as outlined here is, as Goethe might have called it, organ formation, which leads in turn to imaginative insight born of an intimate participation in the course of things. In Buddhist epistemology this has been called \u00d2direct perception\u00d5\u00d5; among the Greeks it was called episteme and was contrasted to inferential reasoning. Knowing of this type is experienced as a kind of seeing, beholding, or direct apprehension, rather than as an intellectual reasoning to a logical conclusion. 25 It is the moment of creative insight which every scientist, scholar, and artist recognizes as the axis around which their work turns but which cannot be produced on demand. Simone Weil termed it \u00d2grace.\u00d5\u00d5 26 In his journal Emerson conjoins artistic and scientific creativity by the illuminating remark, \u00d2Never did any science originate, but by a poetic perception.\u00d5\u00d5 27 While insight is the guide of wise action, its accomplishment requires restraint. We must pause to reflect before speaking, quietly engage the issue inwardly before acting, open ourselves to not knowing before certainty arises, and so we live for a time in the question before the answer emerges. Only under such conditions can the imagination work; recall Keats\u00d5s negative capability. In East Coker T. S. Eliot describes the need for open awareness without expectation: \u00d2Or when under ether, the mind is conscious but conscious of nothing\u00d1/ I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope.\u00d5\u00d5 Poetry, indeed all art as well as all science, flows from such restraint. In a paper written during her first year at Amherst College, Annie Handler struggled to hold the tension between knowing and loving that resolves itself in an epistemology of love. Already at eighteen Annie longed to learn, longed to embrace equally both the sciences and the arts. In her final paper for the first-year seminar \u00d2Eros and Insight,\u00d3 she wrote: This true nourishment of the mind and body is often mistaken with a false nourishment of material objects; however, when looking at Marguerite Porete\u00d5s words \u00d2love Love and do as you will,\u00d5\u00d5 it is clear that the true nourishment of life and living is a love of knowledge\u00d1knowledge of the arts and sciences. No other nourishment is as capable of sustaining life as these two, for the fusion of knowledge and passion for the arts and sciences ultimately lead to a state of immortality, and as Diotima reveals [in Plato\u00d5s Symposium], reaching a state of immortality is a state for which all humans aspire. Annie has worked as an intern in the National Institutes of Health for the last four summers doing research on Parkinson\u00d5s disease and the brain. And yet she refuses to isolate the science she does from the art she loves. In a recent e-mail to me, she wrote, \u00d2 \u00d4Eros and Insight\u00d5 has given me the greatest gift any science researcher could ask for\u00d1the perspective that allows me to simultaneously see the art in nature and the possibilities for incorporating that art into the research of science.\u00d5\u00d5 64 Attending to Interconnection: Living the Lesson Running Head 65 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 So, we come full circle. What began in respectful wonder flows back as insightful and harmonious action in the world and human society. Modestly, we recognize that our knowledge is a reflection of our means of inquiry and the context of our question, and we realize that by attentively circling our subject we enrich our understanding. Traditionally distinct disciplines begin to interweave. Confronted by the problems of the environment, we weave together the insights of science, economics, politics, communication, and even the arts. Each contributes to the fullness of our understanding and the pragmatics of action. Expanding our ontology and enriching our epistemologies in the ways I have indicated is, in my view, a requirement for any future philosophy of education that will give us the integrative education our students and our world sorely need. Awakening Compassion As Parker Palmer rightly observed, the final crucial stone in the infrastructure of integrative education derives from the principle, \u00d2Every epistemology, or way of knowing, as implemented in a pedagogy, or way of teaching and learning, tends to become an ethic, or way of living.\u00d5\u00d5 We believe that ethical thinking and action are supported by integrative teaching and learning. Compassionate action is fostered in students when they learn not only with the intellect but also with the heart. As I have attempted to show, an epistemology of love bridges the divide between intellect and feelings, between objectivity and participation. Once knowing activates our feelings, we are moved to action. We move from being a bystander to being a neighbor or friend. Our intimate understanding of others and their needs prompts compassionate action. We find an instance of exactly this in the program initiated by Judy Goodell and Joan Avis from the University of San Francisco. They note that like so many other universities with noble mission statements, \u00d2the motto of USF is \u00d4educating hearts and minds to change the world.\u00d5 \u00d5\u00d5 Putting these fine words into action, Goodell, Avis, and their students started an educational initiative in the Mayan town of T ekit in the Yucatn which sought to support the education of Mayan youth through high school. As they describe it, The program was designed to meet the educational needs and development of the whole person. We believed from the outset that education of the mind, heart, and spirit must unfold concurrently for meaningful change to occur. Y et even we were amazed at what began to take shape as teachers and learners opened themselves to deep engagement in the circles of each other\u00d5s lives. Through their description of the project, one senses the pedagogical power that helping others brings with it. Words like meaning, values, and purpose lose their abstract philosophical ring when we are aiding others. The capacities we have cultivated are finally put to real, ethical use, and we are motivated to learn more and become more human for the sake of others. Such engagement is one of mutual benefit; an ethical action, rightly taken, invites a reciprocal generosity that can appear in unexpected ways. Integrative education embodies the principle of reciprocity. In the words of Goodell and Avis, Delivering an integrative educational program in a different culture requires a willingness to participate in community ritual events and story making; it is with curiosity, joy, and gratitude that we have done so. It is part of the rich legacy of our own learning. Integrative participatory education is reciprocal. When one heart, mind, and spirit connects to another, both become teacher and learner, and both are changed.

Arthur Zajonc is professor of physics at Amherst College, where he teaches physics and the history of science. His research interests include laser spectroscopy and atomic physics. He is the author of several books such as Catching the Light . For many years he chaired the Anthroposopical Society in North America.

Their biographies and their achievements are indistinguishable. Thus Holmes\u00d5s story provides a brilliantly detailed exposition of the final, dramatic, and inexorable moment before the modern mindset, epitomized by Darwin, took hold. Lastly, the story of the Age of Wonder allows the author, a prize-winning scholar of Romantic poetry, to explore the qualities, the nuanced implications of the imaginative leaps, the search for Imaginative Truth, which the early scientists attempted. Holmes\u00d5s own poetic sensibility, 2 so firmly rooted in scholarship, has led his inquiries into the sources of imagination, whether among the poets or among the scientists, to the edge of spiritual science. Holmes, who was born in 1945, wrote his first prize-winning biography, Shelley: The Pursuit, 3 in 1974. But then, tellingly, he wrote Footsteps, Adventures of a Romantic Biographer, in which he literally tracks a number of writers and poets across the landscapes of Europe and Great Britain. The name Holmes has attached to these physical methods\u00d1his attempts to go where his subjects have been and to do what they have done\u00d1is \u00d2footstepping!\u00d3 Holmes had tentatively begun footstepping in the late 1960s with inquiries into Stevenson, Mary Wollstonecraft and Chatterton. But it was in the writing of the Shelley biography that he adopted its principles in earnest and completely gave himself up to the book to the point of sleeping on an army camp bed \u00d2as if I were on a military campaign.\u00d3 4by Dorit Winter Richard Holmes has written a book that can serve Waldorf teachers as a model for scintillating biography. From it we can learn how to integrate the life of the character into the context of his time, how to find the telling detail, how to stitch the research into a seamless whole, and, perhaps most enviably, how to weave the lives of the characters into a fabric that gives rise to the signature pattern of an age. But then, Richard Holmes is a much-lauded biographer. He has taken biography and biographical research to a whole new level. For although his research is academically impeccable, what interests him as biographer is the possibility of making the life of the subject experiential for the reader. Holmes relies on word-picture and story, and he relishes the function of imagination in bringing his subjects to life. He would have made a terrific class teacher. So, for the Waldorf teacher, there is, first of all, the sheer exhilaration of marvelous story telling. There is also the story itself, which is the dawn of the era in which science and scientist were finally prized apart, surely a topic of compelling interest for any Waldorf teacher. It is the story of how the \u00d2scientific method,\u00d3 i.e. reproducible results under laboratory conditions, became the radically new yardstick. For the early \u00d2scientists\u00d3\u00d1the word first emerges on page 450 of the story 1\u00d1involvement, passion, conviction, enthusiasm, and their own personal discernment were still the measure by Review of The Age of Wonder by Richard Holmes68 Running Head Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 In Footsteps, Holmes writes a \u00d2biography of biography.\u00d3 He is already watching himself as he treks through the physical and emotional landscapes of his subject. This consciousness soul awareness reaches a high point in his masterful two-volume biography of Coleridge, 5 in which Holmes does justice to one of the most underrated thinkers of modern times. It is a brilliant, evocative and extremely perceptive and discerning book, much more than a biography. It is a treatise on a power of observation comparable to Leonardo\u00d5s. What Coleridge actually noticed was life itself, life as in life force. And Holmes, like Owen Barfield, 6 recognizes this singular contribution. Holmes is, clearly, conscious of consciousness. After reading these two volumes about Coleridge, I wrote a piece about Coleridge\u00d5s Imagination. Y es, with a capital \u00d2I\u00d3. 7 In that article I pointed out that Holmes is actually tracking the growth of Coleridge\u00d5s imagination into Imagination. And, while doing so, Holmes is watching his own consciousness as it accompanies the shift in Coleridge\u00d5s consciousness of consciousness. As the previously quoted review of Age of Wonder notes: Holmes has written about how \u00d2empathy is the most powerful, the most necessary, and the most deceptive of all biographical emotions.\u00d3 But for him, biography has always been a \u00d2personal adventure of exploration and pursuit,\u00d3 and it is in this spirit that he has entered the world of 18th-century science. 8 Indeed, it is the controversial \u00d2empathy\u00d3 which makes Holmes\u00d5s biographies such masterpieces of Waldorf presentation. Needless to say, Holmes has as many pages as he wants, and a main lesson, or even a sequence of them, is time-bound, so Holmes can afford as many details and as much narrative as he wishes, whereas the teacher needs to be more concise. Nevertheless, the choice of Holmes\u00d5s details is exemplary, his choice always in the service of the bigger picture, in this case, nothing less than the era in which science, as such, originated in the context of Romantic idealism. Again, it serves our purpose to quote Holmes: But the generation I\u00d5ve written about genuinely wanted to explain their ideas to a larger audience. They don\u00d5t just publish papers, they give interviews and they give lectures. They also mixed with artists and thinkers and they talked together and argued and got excited about things. In so doing they junked the notion of the two cultures, and the work of these scientists fitted in remarkably well with my previous work on Romanticism. 9 Because Holmes is so expertly rooted in the Romantic \u00d2artists and thinkers,\u00d3 he effortlessly embeds the rise of science in contemporary culture. Holmes is keen to show us the biographical (we might say \u00d2karmic\u00d3) connections between the great poets, whom he knows so well, and the early men and women of the new science. Thus, allusions to the Romantic poets abound. Here are a couple: Quoting Byron: The Night is also a religious concern; and even more so, when I viewed the Moon and Stars through Herschel\u00d5s telescope, and saw that they were worlds. 10 Or on Keats\u00d5 celebrated sonnet \u00d2On First Looking into Chapman\u00d5s Homer,\u00d3 in which the poet compares himself to the explorer, Cortez:Keats likens his own discovery of Homer\u00d5s poetry to the experience of the great astronomer and the great explorer finding new worlds. Physical vision \u00d1one might say scientific vision\u00d1brings about a metaphysical shift in the observer\u00d5s view of reality as a whole. The geography of the earth, or the structure of the solar system, are in an instant utterly changed, and forever. The explorer, the scientific observer, the literary reader, experience the Sublime: a moment of revelation into the idea of the unbounded, the infinite. 1168 Research Fellows Running Head 69 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 The subtitle of the book is How the Romantic Generation Discovered the Beauty and T error of Science. A list of chapter titles will provide the main cast of characters. Possible main lesson topics for which these chapters could provide lively details are suggested in parentheses. 1. Joseph Banks in Paradise (7th grade explorers; 8th grade geography) 2. Herschel on the Moon (6th grade astronomy, 7th grade exploration/astronomy, 7th grade physics, 8th grade industrial revolution/invention) 3. Balloonists in Heaven (6th, 7th, or 8th grade geography/cartography, 7th or 8th grade chemistry) 4. Herschel Among the Stars (see 2) (also: high school 12th grade: philosophy or Transcendentalism) 5. Mungo Park in Africa (8th grade geography/cartography) 6. Davy on the Gas (7th or 8th grade chemistry, 8th grade biography) 7. Dr. Frankenstein and the Soul (8th grade short story but more likely high school literature) 8. Davy and the Lamp (6th grade geology, 7th or 8th grade chemistry) 9. Sorcerer and Apprentice (high school history of science) 10. Young Scientists (high school history of science) The book in its entirety could profitably be taken up in high school, in the context of the study of biography as a literary form or as part of the Romantic Poetry block. It would make fine background reading for a study of the Transcendentalists. Chapters 8, 9, and 10 could inspire high school physics; chapters 6 and 8 would make fine background reading for high school chemistry, as would 9, which is principally about Faraday. Because the book goes into considerable detail about the construction and invention of apparati (William Herschel\u00d5s forty-foot reflector telescope and the \u00d2Davy Lamp\u00d3 stand out) as part of the achievement of the inventors, The Age of Wonder is a must have for any background reading to the history of science. There is so much excitement in these descriptions, any teacher would have to get enthused. Although their names don\u00d5t appear in the list of chapter titles, several women, in particular William Herschel\u00d5s younger sister Caroline, are finely portrayed. Holmes has a knack for bringing all the characters to life, but his \u00d2empathy\u00d3 for Caroline\u00d5s position provides us with a previously unsung heroine and a very dramatic story. Mary Shelley is also given her due as a writer of great prescience. Her Frankenstein is raised from clich\u008e to literary and contemporary cultural achievement. The book is written by a born writer, with a writer\u00d5s gift for framing the thought or the picture in captivating prose. Not for nothing has Holmes been recognized by many prestigious prizes. 12 But it is grounded in thorough scholarship, and the Cast List, Bibliography, and References at the end of the book are useful. It would be a grave act of omission on my part were I not to point out the obvious, namely, that The Age of Wonder is a cornucopia of stories tailor-made for the 7th grade main lesson on Wish, Wonder and Surprise. Or, as I point out in my \u00d2little green book,\u00d3 13 Wonder, Wish and Surprise, better called simply Language Arts or Creative Writing. Wonder, as the threshold between the subjective and the objective, is exactly what \u00d2The Art and Science of T eaching Composition\u00d3 is about. It brings many anthroposophical concepts to bear on that threshold between subjective and objective, where the 7th grader is so casually teetering. In his introduction, which begins with the magnetic words, \u00d2In my first chemistry class, at the age of fourteen, I successfully precipitated a single crystal of mineral salts,\u00d3 14 Holmes sums it all up: \u00d2Romanticism as a cultural force is generally regarded as intensely hostile to science, its ideal of subjectivity eternally opposed to that of scientific objectivity. But I do not believe this was always the case, or that the terms are so mutually exclusive. The notion of wonder seems to be something that once united them, and can still do so. In effect there Research Fellows 6970 Running Head Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 is Romantic science in the same sense that there is Romantic poetry, and often for the same enduring reasons.\u00d3 15 A couple of Holmes\u00d5 examples can illustrate that unity. The early astronauts [balloonists] suddenly saw the earth as a giant organism, mysteriously patterned and unfolding, like a living creature. (p.161) It [Herschel\u00d5s paper, \u00d4Astronomical Observations relating to the Construction of the Heavens\u00d5] presented the universe as a living, growing, organic entity, with all nebulae belonging to one enormous extended family! Above all, Herschel\u00d5s studies of nebulae and the general \u00d4construction of the Heavens\u00d5 demonstrated how Copernicus\u00d5 rejection of an earth-centred universe had long been superseded by contemporary science. Not only a sun-centred galaxy, but even a cosmos centred on the Milky Way itself, had to be rejected. This implies an enormous psychological, even spiritual shift in outlook. (p. 205) The final chapters of the book meticulously trace the evolution of consciousness of the premier scientist of his day, Humphrey Davy, who, after a brilliant career, ended his days in solitude and ill health. He kept journals. He wrote. And Holmes follows Davy\u00d5s mind as it begins to float out past the conventional barriers of sense-bound phenomena. This was the very threshold which Coleridge, as Holmes well knows, confronted, and so what Coleridge thought and what Humphrey thought are tracked in consort. Davy and Coleridge were friends (a story in itself, as Holmes makes clear). Davy was a poet as well as man of science; Coleridge, the great poet, felt himself to be, more and more, a man of science. Men of enormous intellect and highly individualistic modes of thought, they each found their way to a similar, and eventually disparaged, position in the great Vitalism debate which ushered in the starkly materialistic view of life in which we find ourselves today. \u00d2Was the eel nature\u00d5s voltaic battery, and did it hold a clue to Vitalism?\u00d1a question which would come to haunt Davy.\u00d3 (p.356) \u00d2Coleridge\u00d5s position remained that the \u00d4life principle\u00d5 certainly did exist, but had nothing to do with physiology.\u00d3 (p.322) It was not \u00d2mechanistic.\u00d3 Says Holmes of Coleridge: \u00d2He felt that the new poetry and the new science were so closely entwined that they must somehow merge!\u00d3 p.274) While of Davy Holmes reports: Davy also referred frequently in his later lectures to comparisons between the poetic and the scientific imagination. In 1807 he wrote in terms that would be echoed both by Coleridge and by Keats: \u00d2The perception of truth is almost as simple a feeling as the perception of beauty; and the genius of Newton, of Shakespeare, of Michael Angelo, and of Handel are not very remote in character from each other. Imagination, as well as the reason, is necessary to perfection in the philosophic mind. A rapidity of combination, a power of perceiving analogies and of comparing them by facts, is the creative source of discovery.\u00d3 (p.276) Isn\u00d5t this a fine rendering of two of the tenets of Waldorf pedagogy, namely, to perceive through analogy and to clothe science in beauty? Holmes, with his exquisite two-volume biography of Coleridge, his poetic sensibility, and his thrill at the rise of science through such men as Davy, a genius of early chemistry, appreciates the resonances, we might say, the karma between the two: Davy\u00d5s notebooks for this period also suggest a new pattern of philosophical speculation, almost approaching German Naturphilosophie. Some of his observations would have been recognized by Coleridge: 70 Research Fellows Running Head 71 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 \u00d2The aspirations for immortality are movements of the mind similar to those which a bird makes with its wings before they are furnished with feathers.\u00d3 (p.357) As I was reading the book, it seemed to me that there were many instances in which this understanding of the oneness of art and science was Holmes\u00d5s subtext, his message. What makes his message so remarkable is the scholarship by which he arrives at it. Like two of his subjects, Davy and Coleridge, Holmes himself is applying a quality of living thinking to his material. His scholarship is enlivened by Imagination, or something close to it, and that is what makes this book (like all of Holmes\u00d5s biographical studies) so potent. The early scientists, whose efforts pre-dated the term \u00d2scientist,\u00d3 still saw the universe as One. They still could relate to \u00d2The Cosmos as Artist.\u00d3 16 For them, \u00d2cosmos as artist\u00d3 meant \u00d2cosmos as scientist.\u00d3 This awareness still fueled the \u00d2great Vitalism debate\u00d3 with which the Age of Wonder ends.

For a week starting on February 18, the Chicago Waldorf School hosted the first of three one-week intensives to explore the richness of the Grades 6\u00d08 Waldorf science curriculum. This course also strives to give teachers a living relationship to the sciences, as its task in this present age of consciousness is to help individuals connect to the world. The February session\u00d0\u00d0the largest ever cycle of this course\u00d0\u00d0was filled to the brim with 27 earnest participants, mostly from the Midwestern states, but also from schools as far away as San Francisco, New York, and three in Canada. The members of the group were class teachers ranging from Grade 3 to Grade 8, several with many years of experience. Michael D\u00d5Aleo, an engineer and high school science teacher at the Waldorf School of Saratoga Springs, along with the Research Institute, organized this course with the help of the Chicago Waldorf School and a grant secured by AWSNA from the Waldorf Educational Foundation. Michael took the group through a process which, in the way it presents the sciences and awakens our senses, allows us to know the world directly through our own experience. Habitual thinking can hamper this wakefulness, partly because the Latinization of our language prompts its structure to do our thinking for us. Noun-like qualities have consequently adhered to activities such as visual, acoustic, thermal and other phenomena, removing the possibility of our building a relationship between ourselves and the world we live in. We need to recover a sense-based science that places us within our experiences and builds a connection between the outer world and ourselves. Becoming more conscious of our own process of perception reconnects us to our environment. If in our mind\u00d5s eye we track the child back to a time before its birth, we experience the child coming from wholeness and gradually awakening to its separateness from the surrounding world. The child slowly becomes aware \u00d2I am I.\u00d3 Being born into the world and becoming self-aware are necessary for the unfolding of what Rudolf Steiner called the consciousness soul. We become aware of the outer and the inner, object and subject\u00d1indeed, all aspects of the world that have become separated. Our task in this age is to make them whole again. This new way of thinking asks us to take the wakefulness we have in the outer world and bring it into ourselves, making our awakened being resonate with what is around us. At that moment we become one with the outer world\u00d1we resonate with it in the rhythmic part of our being. What happens within and without thus become resonating harmonics and we are now fully awake and conscious. We become objects to ourselves in the way Steiner described this process to workers at the Goetheanum in a lecture reprinted in Otto Palmer\u00d5s helpful guide, Rudolf Steiner on His Book The Philosophy of Freedom. The opportunity exists to be fully present in this world, and so doing we can overcome feelings of alienation and separateness. Instead we can reconnect with that same world of wholeness, a world of ideas from which we emerged at birth. In the words of the poet David Whyte, \u00d2Put down the weight of your aloneness and ease into the conversation.\u00d3 Report on Teaching Sensible Science Running Head 73 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 The lessons in the science classes are approached in this way: The whole is separated and then through the process described above made whole again. It is not the thoughts that are enlivened by these methods, but the activity of thinking itself. The development of demonstrations and experiments is like the development of new thinking\u00d1we take in an impression of the world, we still ourselves inwardly so that it can resonate as a feeling, and then we take the final step of finding a relationship to it or an affirmation of the whole that is truthful beyond our own selves. Michael led the course with the help of Gary Banks\u00d0\u00d0an engineer, class teacher and high school science teacher\u00d0\u00d0and Lylli Anthon, a long-time class teacher. Barbara Richardson, a seasoned eurythmist and coordinator of Foundation Studies at the Center for Anthroposophy, took us through exercises in eurythmy as a way of supporting our work and exploring the nature of experience and collaboration. Our mornings were filled with epistemological discussions facilitated by Michael, followed by eurythmy exercises with Barbara. In the afternoons with Gary and Lylli we explored the experiments that form the heart of the physics curriculum. Contributions to the chemistry curriculum were offered in several evening sessions with Gary. The first step in this approach to science is to facilitate the student\u00d5s connection to phenomena in the natural world, while holding back the idea or concept we intend the students to grasp. This experience leaves them with questions. We then provide the students with the opportunity to describe what they saw and then to find relationships among the phenomena that could be truthful for others, or relationships that are truthful beyond their own individual experiences. On our first morning together we were each asked to plunge our hand, up past our wrist, into a bag of ice cubes and then leave it there for two minutes. We later began to share the sensations we felt and any personal experiences we had as our hands remained in the ice. After much discussion we tried to describe the relationship of our hands to the icy medium which was common to all, relationships transcending our own personal ones. We were all able to experience that coldness invaded us as our warm hand became cooler. The changing sensation was the basis of the experience. We spoke at length about living in the sensation and avoiding words like \u00d2heat\u00d3 and \u00d2cold,\u00d3 nouns that speak of these sensations as things. We tried to live into the activity and sense it as a change and not as a \u00d2thing\u00d3 that had noun-like attributes. The beginning, middle, and end must all be related as elements of an entire movement. If the perception is preceded by the feeling or thinking, then the whole movement dissolves into disharmony. If the perception is not broad enough, then the feeling and thinking has no possibility of experiencing the fullness of this movement. (Michael D\u00d5Aleo) Thus we all strengthened our understanding of why in the science lessons we must strive not to be merely teaching a concept of the physical world to the students, but to aid them in discovering essential aspects of being human. We are helping the students connect to the world. We also spoke at length about how to present the lessons so the class is able to live into the experience of the phenomena. T o achieve this it is important for teachers to perform the experiment for themselves before doing it with their students. When it then comes to the lesson, the less said the better. No introduction of the phenomena should be given beyond creating the conditions for observation\u00d0\u00d0watching, listening, and inner stillness\u00d0\u00d0so that the students are able to figure out as much as possible for themselves. A teacher\u00d5s warm interest in the phenomena creates a further condition for mindful observation by the students. During the afternoons we had lots of practice in how to best review the experiments from the previous day. The nightly sleep is an important Reports from Current Projects of the Research Institute 7374 Running Head Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 element in the cycle of discovery, as is the verbal re-creation of what was done the day before. The review needs to be kept alive as a will activity, so that it becomes a dynamic social element for the class. Michael asked us to craft our lessons in such a way that the students develop inner relationships to the phenomena extending beyond the conditions we have described in each experiment. There was much discussion about the wording used to sum up the experiments, such as relationship, concept, or conclusion. It is our responsibility not to fix concepts, but to plant the seeds for the new thinking. After one very full week we adjourned\u00d1some to stay on for the AWSNA regional teachers conference in Chicago, with Michael as the keynote speaker, others to return home. All were left with a feeling of anticipation for our next session coming up in June\u00d0\u00d0a feeling, as David Whyte puts it, that \u00d2everything is waiting for you.\u00d3 74 Reports from Current Projects of the Research Institute Running Head 75 Research Bulletin Spring 2011 Volume 16 #1 by Marianne AlsopReport on the Online Waldorf Library The Online Waldorf Library continues to help facilitate research and answer questions on a wide variety of topics.

It receives support and guidance from the Pedagogical Section of the School of Spiritual Science and financial support through the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA), the Midwest Shared Gifting Group, the Waldorf Schools Fund, the Waldorf Curriculum Fund, and private donors through the Rudolf Steiner Foundation. The Research Institute was founded in 1996 in order to deepen and enhance the quality of Waldorf education, to engage in serious and sustained dialogue with the wider educational-cultural community, and to support research that would serve educators in all types of schools in their work with children and adolescents. The Research Institute has responded to the call for research as a top priority of the Waldorf school movement by becoming a supporting organization of AWSNA and by co- sponsoring research projects with the Association and with the Pedagogical Section. We support research projects that deal with essential contemporary educational issues such as the role of play in early childhood, attention-related disorders, trends in adolescent development and innovations in the high school curriculum, survey of Waldorf graduates, learning expectations and assessment, computers in education, the role of art in education, and new ways to identify and address different learning styles. The Research Institute has sponsored colloquia and conferences that have brought together educators, psychologists, doctors, and social scientists. We have published a Research Bulletin twice a year for the last decade, and we are developing and distributing educational resources to help teachers in all aspects of their work. We sponsor the Online Waldorf Library: www.waldorflibrary.org, whose mission is to make available contemporary writings on Waldorf education, and we host our own site: www.waldorfresearchinstitute.org, where up-to-date research is posted. The Research Institute is a 501(c) (3) tax-exempt organization and gratefully accepts donations.
