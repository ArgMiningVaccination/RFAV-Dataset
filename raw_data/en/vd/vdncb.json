Best interests and welfare of child - Court consideration - Factors. 1.For the purpose of parental rights and responsibilities, the best interests and welfare of the child is determined by the court's consideration and evaluation of all factors Page No. 1affecting the best interests and welfare of the child. These factors include all of the following when applicable: a.The love, affection, and other emotional ties existing between the parents and child and the ability of each parent to provide the child with nurture, love, affection, and guidance. b.The ability of each parent to assure that the child receives adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and a safe environment. c.The child's developmental needs and the ability of each parent to meet those needs, both in the present and in the future. d.The sufficiency and stability of each parent's home environment, the impact of extended family, the length of time the child has lived in each parent's home, and the desirability of maintaining continuity in the child's home and community. e.The willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the other parent and the child. f.The moral fitness of the parents, as that fitness impacts the child. g.The mental and physical health of the parents, as that health impacts the child. h.The home, school, and community records of the child and the potential effect of any change. i.If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that a child is of sufficient maturity to make a sound judgment, the court may give substantial weight to the preference of the mature child. The court also shall give due consideration to other factors that may have affected the child's preference, including whether the child's preference was based on undesirable or improper influences. j.Evidence of domestic violence. In determining parental rights and responsibilities, the court shall consider evidence of domestic violence. If the court finds credible evidence that domestic violence has occurred, and there exists one incident of domestic violence which resulted in serious bodily injury or involved the use of a dangerous weapon or there exists a pattern of domestic violence within a reasonable time proximate to the proceeding, this combination creates a rebuttable presumption that a parent who has perpetrated domestic violence may not be awarded residential responsibility for the child. This presumption may be overcome only by clear and convincing evidence that the best interests of the child require that parent have residential responsibility. The court shall cite specific findings of fact to show that the residential responsibility best protects the child and the parent or other family or household member who is the victim of domestic violence. If necessary to protect the welfare of the child, residential responsibility for a child may be awarded to a suitable third person, provided that the person would not allow access to a violent parent except as ordered by the court. If the court awards residential responsibility to a third person, the court shall give priority to the child's nearest suitable adult relative. The fact that the abused parent suffers from the effects of the abuse may not be grounds for denying that parent residential responsibility. As used in this subdivision, \"domestic violence\" means domestic violence as defined in section 14 -07.1-01. A court may consider, but is not bound by, a finding of domestic violence in another proceeding under chapter 14 -07.1. k.The interaction and inter-relationship, or the potential for interaction and inter- relationship, of the child with any person who resides in, is present, or frequents the household of a parent and who may significantly affect the child's best interests. The court shall consider that person's history of inflicting, or tendency to inflict, physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or the fear of physical harm, bodily injury, or assault, on other persons. l.The making of false allegations not made in good faith, by one parent against the other, of harm to a child. m.Any other factors considered by the court to be relevant to a particular parental rights and responsibilities dispute. Page No. 22.In a proceeding for parental rights and responsibilities of a child of a service member, a court may not consider a parent's past deployment or possible future deployment in itself in determining the best interests of the child but may consider any significant impact on the best interests of the child of the parent's past or possible future deployment. 3.In any proceeding under this chapter, the court, at any stage of the proceedings after final judgment, may make orders about what security is to be given for the care, custody, and support of the unmarried minor children of the marriage as from the circumstances of the parties and the nature of the case is equitable. 14-09-06.3. Parenting investigations and reports - Costs. 1.In contested proceedings dealing with parental rights and responsibilities the court, upon the request of either party, or, upon its own motion, may appoint a parenting investigator and order an investigation and report concerning parenting rights and responsibilities regarding the child. The supreme court shall adopt rules establishing the minimum qualifications of a parenting investigator and maintain and make available to the public a roster of individuals eligible to serve as a parenting investigator. The roster must include each individual's name, address, and telephone number. The parenting investigator appointed must be on the public roster of those eligible to serve as a parenting investigator . 2.The investigator may consult any person who may have information about the child and any potential arrangements for parenting rights and responsibilities, and upon order of the court may refer the child to any professional personnel for diagnosis. 3.The parenting investigator shall file the investigator's report with the court and serve the report on counsel and any party not represented by counsel at least thirty days before the hearing. The investigator shall make available to any such counsel or party the complete file of data and reports underlying the investigator's report and the names and addresses of all persons whom the investigator has consulted. A party may call the investigator and any person whom the investigator has consulted for cross-examination at the hearing. A party may not waive the party's right of cross-examination before the hearing. 4.If the parties are indigent , the court shall enter an order stating the expenses of any such investigation must be borne by the county where the child resided at the time the action was commenced or if a modification of parental rights and responsibilities, at the time the motion to modify is served. 5.Following the decision by the court regarding parenting rights and responsibilities, the parenting investigator must be discharged of the investigator's duties as investigator. 6.A parenting investigator appointed under this section who acts in good faith in making a report to the court is immune from any civil liability resulting from the report. For the purpose of determining good faith, the good faith of the parenting investigator is a disputable presumption. 14-09-06.4. Appointment of attorney guardian ad litem for child in proceedings involving parental rights and responsibilities - Immunity. 1.In any action for an annulment, divorce, legal separation, or other action affecting marriage, when either party has reason for special concern as to the future of the minor child, and in any action when the parenting rights and responsibilities concerning the child is contested, the court, upon motion of the court or by motion or agreement of the parties, may appoint an attorney guardian ad litem to represent the child concerning parenting rights and responsibilities. 2.If appointed, an attorney guardian ad litem shall serve as an advocate of the child's best interests. 3.The court may direct either or both parties to pay the attorney guardian ad litem fee established by the court.

The court may direct either or both parties to reimburse the county, in whole or in part, for such payment. 4.An attorney guardian ad litem appointed under this section who acts in good faith in making a report to the court is immune from any civil liability resulting from the report. For the purpose of determining good faith, the good faith of the attorney guardian ad litem is a disputable presumption. 14-09-06.5. Allegation of harm to child - Effect. If the court finds that an allegation of harm to a child by one parent against the other is false and not made in good faith, the court shall order the parent making the false allegation to pay court costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the other parent in responding to the allegation. 14-09-06.6.

The court shall set a date for an evidentiary hearing only if a prima facie case is established. 5.The court may not modify the primary residential responsibility within the two -year period following the date of entry of an order establishing primary residential responsibility unless the court finds the modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the child and: a.The persistent and willful denial or interference with parenting time; b.The child's present environment may endanger the child's physical or emotional health or impair the child's emotional development; or c.The residential responsibility for the child has changed to the other parent for longer than six months. 6.The court may modify the primary residential responsibility after the two -year period following the date of entry of an order establishing primary residential responsibility if the court finds: a.On the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior order or which were unknown to the court at the time of the prior order, a material change has occurred in the circumstances of the child or the parties; and b.The modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the child. 7.The court may modify a prior order concerning primary residential responsibility at any time if the court finds a stipulated agreement by the parties to modify the order is in the best interests of the child. Page No. 48.Upon a motion to modify primary residential responsibility under this section, the burden of proof is on the moving party. 14-09-07. Residence of child. 1.A parent with primary residential responsibility for a child may not change the primary residence of the child to another state except upon order of the court or with the consent of the other parent, if the other parent has been given parenting time by the decree. 2.A parent with equal residential responsibility for a child may not change the residence of the child to another state except with consent of the other parent or order of the court allowing the move and awarding that parent primary residential responsibility. 3.A court order is not required if the other parent: a.Has not exercised parenting time for a period of one year; or b.Has moved to another state and is more than fifty miles [80.47 kilometers] from the residence of the parent with primary residential responsibility. 14-09-08.

Unless dates for the commencement or termination of a child support obligation are specified by the court's order, a judgment or order requiring the payment of child support is effective as to the child in the month in which the order is signed and continues until the end of the month in which the support obligation terminates. 14-09-08.4. Periodic review of child support orders. 1.Each child support order being enforced by the child support agency must be reviewed by the child support agency no less frequently than thirty -six months after the Page No. 6establishment of the order or the most recent amendment or review of the order by the court or child support agency unless: a.In the case of an order with respect to which there is in effect an assignment under chapter 50-09, the child support agency has determined that a review is not in the best interests of the child and neither the obligor nor the obligee has requested review; b.In the case of any other order neither the obligor nor the obligee has requested review; or c.In the case of a review requested by the obligor, the obligor failed to provide information required under subsection 1 of section 14 -09-08.6 with the request for review. 2.Each child support order, in which there is in effect an assignment under chapter 50 -09 or with respect to which either the obligor or the obligee has requested review, must be reviewed by the child support agency if: a.More than twelve months have passed since the establishment of the order or the most recent amendment or review of that order by the court or child support agency, whichever is later; and b.The order provides for no child support and was based on a finding that the obligor has no ability to pay child support. 3.If, upon review, the child support agency determines that the order provides for child support payments in an amount that is inconsistent with the amount that would be required by the child support guidelines established under subsection 1 of section 14-09-09.7, the child support agency may seek an amendment of the order. If the order provides for child support payments in an amount less than eighty -five percent or more than one hundred fifteen percent of the amount that would be required by those guidelines, the child support agency shall seek an amendment of the order. 4.If a child support obligation sought to be amended was entered at least one year before the filing of a motion or petition for amendment, the court shall order the amendment of the child support obligation to conform the amount of child support payment to that required under the child support guidelines, whether or not the motion or petition for amendment arises out of a periodic review of a child support obligation, and whether or not a material change of circumstances has taken place, unless the presumption that the correct amount of child support would result from the application of the child support guidelines is rebutted. If a motion or petition for amendment is filed within one year of the entry of the obligation sought to be amended, the party seeking amendment must also show a material change of circumstances. 5.A determination that a child who is the subject of a child support order is eligible for benefits furnished under subsection 16 or 18 of section 50 -06-05.1 or chapter 50-09 or 50-24.1, or any substantially similar program operated by any state or tribal government, constitutes a material change of circumstances. The availability of health insurance at reasonable cost to a child who is the subject of a child support order constitutes a material change of circumstances. The need to provide for a child's health care needs, through health insurance or other means, constitutes a material change of circumstances. 14-09-08.5.

If the obligor contests that withholding, the court shall: a.Hold a hearing within ten working days after the date of the request; and b.Confirm the withholding in the absence of a finding: (1)Of a mistake of fact; or (2)That the obligee is required to provide health insurance coverage pursuant to section 14-09-08.10. 3.Unless otherwise provided by the child support agency in compliance with rules promulgated by the secretary of the United States department of health and human services, the withholding provided in subdivision e of subsection 1 has priority over Page No. 10any other legal process against the same income, except that withholding required by an order issued under section 14 -09-09.15 must be satisfied before any payment is made to the insurer. If the amount remaining is insufficient to pay the obligor's share of premiums for health insurance coverage, the obligor may authorize additional withholding to pay the obligor's share. If the obligor does not authorize additional withholding, and the health insurance coverage will lapse as a result, the employer must promptly inform the child support agency of the insufficiency. 4.An employer receiving a national medical support notice under this section is subject to the same duties and liabilities as an income payer under section 14 -09-09.3 unless the context indicates otherwise. 5.For purposes of this section: a.\"Employer\" means an entity or individual who would be determined to be an employer under section 3401(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended [26 U.S.C. 3401(d)], and includes any governmental entity and any labor organization; and b.\"Insurer\" has the meaning provided in section 26.1 -36.5-01. 14-09-08.12.

Any attempt to renounce, waive, assign, transfer, or disclaim such an interest is void if attempted after notice of the delinquency is furnished to the person administering the estate, trust, or similar device, and is otherwise voidable. 14-09-08.18. Health insurance reimbursements received by but not owed to obligor to be paid over - Finding of contempt - Treatment as delinquent child support. 1.A payment for services rendered by a medical provider to an obligor's dependent which is directed to the obligor in the form of reimbursements from health insurance must be paid to the medical provider, custodial parent, or child support agency when the reimbursement is not owed to the obligor. 2.Any child support order that requires an obligor to provide health insurance is deemed to include the requirements of this section.

L. 105-200; 112 Stat. 645] and regulations adopted thereunder; and Page No. 13e.\"Title IV-D\" has the meaning provided in section 50 -09-01. 14-09-08.21. Termination of parental rights - Duty of support.

When an obligee is required to provide health insurance coverage for a child as a beneficiary under section 14 -09-08.10, the order is being enforced under title IV-D, and the obligee's employer has been identified, the child support agency may use the national medical support notice to enforce the provision of health insurance coverage for the child.

Liability of stepparent for support. A stepparent is not bound to maintain the spouse's dependent children, as defined in section 50-09-01, unless the child is received into the stepparent's family. If the stepparent receives them into the family, the stepparent is liable, to the extent of the stepparent's ability, to support them during the marriage and so long thereafter as they remain in the stepparent's family. Such liability may be enforced against the stepparent by any person furnishing necessaries to such children. If an order issued under section 14 -09-08.10 requires an obligee to provide health insurance coverage, any coverage that is available to the stepparent for the obligee's dependent children is considered to be available to the obligee and is enforceable against the stepparent by a child support agency. If the children are received into the stepparent's family and supported by the stepparent, it is presumed that the stepparent does so as a parent, in which case the children are not liable to the stepparent for their support, nor the stepparent to them for their services. The legal obligation of a natural or adoptive parent to support that person's children is not affected by the liability imposed upon their stepparent by this section. 14-09-09.1.

If an income payer fails or refuses to withhold or deliver income for more than fourteen business days after the date an obligor is paid, the court shall award damages in an amount equal to two hundred dollars or actual damages caused by the violation, whichever is greater, in addition to the amount of income that should have been withheld or delivered, costs, interest, late fees, and reasonable attorney's fees. Any damages awarded under this subsection must be allocated by the court Page No. 14between each affected obligor and obligee, or made payable on behalf of an obligor to the state disbursement unit for distribution under section 14 -09-25. Each remedy authorized in this subsection is a remedial sanction as defined in section 27 -10-01.1. 3.Any employer who refuses to employ, dismisses, demotes, disciplines, or in any way penalizes an obligor on account of any proceeding to collect child support, on account of any order or orders entered by the court in such proceeding, on account of the employer's compliance with such order or orders, or on account of an income withholding order, is liable to the obligor for all damages, together with costs, interest thereon, and reasonable attorney's fees resulting from the employer's action. The employer may be required to make full restitution to the aggrieved obligor, including reinstatements and backpay. 4.An income payer may be enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction from continuing any action in violation of section 14 -09-09.16. 5.Any contempt proceeding against an income payer under this section must be commenced within one year after the income payer's act or failure to act upon which such proceeding is based. 6.Compliance by an income payer with an income withholding order operates as a discharge of the income payer's liability to the obligor as to that portion of the obligor's income so affected. 7.In considering an income withholding order issued by a court or administrative tribunal in a state other than the state of the obligor's principal place of employment, the income payer shall apply the law of the state of the obligor's principal place of employment in determining any withholding terms and conditions not specified in the income withholding order or in section 14 -12.2-33.1. 8.An employer who complies with an income withholding order that is regular on its face is not subject to civil liability to any individual or agency for conduct in compliance with the order. 9.An income payer who fails to withhold or deliver income for more than seven business days after the date one or more obligors are paid may be charged a late fee equal to twenty-five dollars per obligor for each additional business day the payment is delinquent or seventy -five dollars for each additional business day the payment is delinquent, whichever is greater. A late fee charged under this subsection is payable fifteen days after service on the employer, by first -class mail, of notice of the imposition of the late fee. Failure to pay a late fee under this subsection may be sanctioned as a contempt of court. Any late fee assessed by the child support agency under this subsection must be paid to the state disbursement unit for distribution under section 14-09-25 and any remaining balance must be paid to the obligor. If an income payer has failed to withhold or deliver income for more than one obligor, any late fees collected under this section must be divided equally among all affected obligors. 10.If an income payer makes an error in the remittal information the income payer provides to the state disbursement unit, the income payer has not complied with this section and is responsible for the error, but has a cause of action for reimbursement against any person that receives funds from the disbursement unit as a result of the error and refuses to return the funds upon request. 14-09-09.4. Child support - Order for wage assignment or to withhold and transmit earnings - Dissolution, revocation or modification. Repealed by S.L. 1987, ch. 183, \u00a7 16. 14-09-09.5. Child support - Judgment or order as lien on property - Duration - Effect. Repealed by S.L. 1981, ch. 172, \u00a7 1. 14-09-09.6. Voluntary income withholding for support - Limitations. An obligor may execute a document voluntarily authorizing income withholding from current or future income due the obligor from an income payer in an amount sufficient to meet any child Page No. 15support obligation imposed by a court or otherwise. An income withholding authorization made under this section is binding on the income payer one week after service upon the income payer by first-class mail, or in any other manner agreed to by the income payer, of a true copy of the executed income withholding authorization. The income payer shall deduct the sum or sums specified and pay them as specified by the income withholding authorization and any applicable imposition of a support obligation by a court. In addition, the income payer may deduct a fee of three dollars per month from the obligor's income to cover expenses involved in transmitting payment. Compliance by an income payer with an income withholding authorization issued under this section discharges the income payer's liability to the obligor for that portion of the obligor's income. The income payer may not use the income withholding authorization as a basis for any disciplinary action against the obligor. 14-09-09.7. Child support guidelines. 1.The department of health and human services shall establish child support guidelines to assist courts in determining the amount a parent should be expected to contribute toward the support of the child under this section. The guidelines must: a.Include consideration of gross income. For purposes of the guidelines, gross income does not include an employee benefit over which the employee does not have significant influence or control over the nature or amount unless: (1)That benefit may be liquidated; and (2)Liquidation of that benefit does not result in the employee incurring an income tax penalty. b.Authorize an expense deduction for determining net income. c.Designate other available resources to be considered. d.Specify the circumstances that should be considered in reducing support contributions on the basis of hardship. e.Include consideration of extended periods of time a minor child spends with the child's obligor parent. f.Authorize a rebuttal of the presumption provided in subsection 4 based on the proportionate net income of the obligor and the obligee when the net income of the obligee is at least three times higher than the net income of the obligor. g.Include consideration of an obligated party's responsibility for health insurance coverage or other medical support under section 14 -09-08.10. 2.The guidelines may not take into consideration cases of atypical overtime wages or nonrecurring bonuses over which the obligor does not have significant influence or control. 3.The department shall accept and compile pertinent and reliable information from any available source in order to establish the child support guidelines. Copies of the guidelines must be made available to courts, state's attorneys, and upon request, to any other state or county officer or agency engaged in the administration or enforcement of this chapter. 4.There is a rebuttable presumption that the amount of child support that would result from the application of the child support guidelines is the correct amount of child support. The presumption may be rebutted if a preponderance of the evidence in a contested matter establishes, applying criteria established by the child support agency which take into consideration the best interests of the child, that the child support amount established under the guidelines is not the correct amount of child support. A written finding or a specific finding on the record must be made if the court determines that the presumption has been rebutted. The finding must: a.State the child support amount determined through application of the guidelines; b.Identify the criteria that rebut the presumption of correctness of that amount; and c.State the child support amount determined after application of the criteria that rebut the presumption. 5.The department shall institute a new rulemaking proceeding under section 28 -32-02 relating to the child support guidelines to ensure that the application of the guidelines results in the determination of appropriate child support award amounts. The initial Page No. 16rulemaking proceeding must be commenced with a notice of proposed adoption, amendment, or repeal by August 1, 1998, and subsequent rulemaking proceedings must be so commenced at least once every four years thereafter. Before commencing any rulemaking proceeding under this section, the department shall convene a drafting advisory committee that includes two members of the legislative assembly appointed by the chairman of the legislative management. 6.The guidelines established under this section may include a separate amount of child support for the child's health insurance coverage, reimbursement for public health coverage provided under chapter 50 -29, and other medical support. 14-09-09.8.

An attorney so employed or contracted represents the interest of the people of the state of North Dakota in the enforcement of child support obligations. Nothing in this section may be construed to modify confidentiality required of the child support agency. Representation by the employed or contracted attorney may not be construed to create an attorney -client relationship between the attorney and any party or witness to the action, other than the people of the state of North Dakota, regardless of the name in which the action is brought. 14-09-09.28. Application to existing cases. Sections 14-09-09.26, 14-09-09.27, 14-12.2-19, and 14-12.2-20 apply to actions filed prior to July 7, 1991. 14-09-09.29.

Notwithstanding subsection 1, the court may issue a stay of any further accruals under a child support order if the court finds the stay would be in the best interests of the child. Avoidance of income withholding or the requirement to make any child support payment through the state disbursement unit is not a proper basis to stay a child support obligation under this subsection. A child support obligation that is stayed under this subsection may be reinstated on a prospective basis as provided under the terms of the stay or at any time by order of the court or upon affidavit of any party. The party filing the affidavit shall provide a copy of the affidavit to any other party to the action and to the state disbursement unit. 14-09-09.33.
