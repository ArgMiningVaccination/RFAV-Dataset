This mineral is particularly important for muscle function, nerves and the nervous system, for building normal teeth and bones as well as for the electrolyte balance within the body. Biogena 7-Salt Magnesium it? seven magnesium compounds. With this, Biogena product development has created a capsule with an ideal mixture of various soluble and magnesium-rich compounds. This provides a good magnesium supply - regardless of the pH-situation in the gastrointestinal tract. Magnesium is not just magnesium ... ... because the solubility of each magnesium compound changes in response to the naturally fluctuating pH-conditions of the intestinal tract. The background: So that the intestinal tract can take up magnesium into our bodies, elemental magnesium must first be released from it's salt compound. The efficiency of this process is primarily dependent on the existing pH-value. In a healthy stomach, all the soluble magnesium compounds are easily broken down in the strongly acidic environment. However, there is also an alkaline environment in later sections of the digestive tract. Here, the solubility of various magnesium compounds can be adversely affected. Many factors, such as the type and amount of nutrition, bacterial colonization of the intestine and individual parameters determine the pH value of the digestive tract. Therefore, a balanced mixture of magnesium salts with different solubility characteristics, is favorable. A further distinctive feature of the different magnesium compounds is their magnesium content. While magnesium oxide supplies a lot of magnesium, it is only easily soluble in an acidic pH. Magnesium citrate on the other hand contains only small amounts of magnesium but is readily available to the body at basic pH-values. 7-Salt Magnesium - To increase magnesium intake in case of magnesium losses e.g. during sport** - In case of increased magnesium requirement during growth and pregnancy** - Magnesium plays an important role in muscular activity - in both muscle contraction and relaxation - and in the electrolyte balance of the body** - Magnesium has important functions in the nervous system, supports the normal functioning of the psyche and helps reduce tiredness and fatigue** Warning: High doses of magnesium can lead to diarrhea. When taking higher amounts, it is recommended that these are distributed over the course of the day. Magnesium can disrupt the absorption of iron. An interval of 2-3 hours is recommended if an iron preparation is being taken concomitantly.
