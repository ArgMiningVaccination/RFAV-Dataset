GET YOUR APPLICATION IN FOR OCTOBER!The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 7 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 8 Vic Strecher, a behavioral scientist, is an energetic, trim, and youthful sixty-two year old. He teaches at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health and is Visiting Professor at the Peking University's School of Public Health. He has given hundreds of talks the world over. (He jokes that his frequent flyer miles are sky-high.) His TED Talks and recorded lectures, replete with PowerPoint presentations featuring trademark symbols from his graphic novel, On Purpose, have given him a YouTube presence and a popular culture crossover audience. He has long been admired for turning his research into practical applications and is the recipient of over a dozen prestigious awards. These include: the Secretary of Health and Human Services Award for Innovations in Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, the Delta Omega National Merit Award for Outstanding Achievement in Public Health, the Smithsonian's \"Laureate Medal\" in both 2001 and 2002, the C. Everett Koop National Health Award, the University of Michigan's \"Distinguished Innovator of the Year,\" and the U-M School of Public Health's \"Award for Translating Research into Practice.\" With the uniquely innovative spirit he brings to the field of public health, Strecher commands widespread admiration for his scholarship, and practical contributions to the area of public health. Strecher holds a Masters and Ph.D. in Health Behavior and Health Education from U-M's School of Public Health. Since 1995, when he completed his Ph.D., he has been on the U-M faculty at the School of Public Health. He has served as director of several research centers, including the Health Communications Research Library at the University of North Carolina's School of Public Health; the U-M's Health Communications Research (which he founded in 1996); and the Cancer Prevention and Control at U-M's Comprehensive Cancer Center. Currently, he is Director for Innovation and Social Entrepreneurship at U-M's School of Public Health. Strecher is a scholar committed to making his scientific approach accessible to the lay public. The protagonist of his graphic novel, On Purpose, beautifully illustrated by Kody Chamberlain, is a wise dung beetle named Winston. (Winston blogs on his own website: www.dungbeetle.org.) The graphic novel was followed by Strecher's more academic version of the book: Life on Purpose: How Living for What Matters Most Changes Everything . In both these books, Strecher begins each chapter with a quotation from a famous figure in history. (These quotations offer a glimpse at the breadth of Strecher's reading and his methodical approach to the things he does.) On Purpose has eight chapters. Prefaces are from Rumi, the 13 th Century Persian poet (\"The breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you. Don't go back to sleep.\"); Thomas Merton, a 20th century Trappist monk, poet, social activist, and student of comparative religion; Viktor Frankl; Saint Francis of Assisi (12 th century, \"Every life needs a purpose to which it can give the energies of its mind and the enthusiasm of its heart.\"); Elizabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross; William James; Rainer Maria Rilke; Basho (16 th century Japanese poet, \"A bee / staggers out / of the peony.\"). In the second book, Life on Purpose: How Living for What Matters Most Changes Everything, chapters are prefaced with quotations from Leo Tolstoy; you can't swear off drinking; it's easy. I've done it a thousand times.\" \u2014 for the chapter happy.\"); David Foster Wallace (\"'Learning how to think' really means learning how to exercise control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how to construct meaning from experience.\"); Seneca (\"The life we receive is not short, but we make it so, nor do we have any lack of it, but are wasteful of it.\"). In addition to the dung beetle, Strecher uses the metaphor of a frog in a pot of water, slowly boiling to death, to represent mankind's passivity in the fact of a daunting crisis. This image came to him in the wake of his daughter's death, at age nineteen, six years ago. It was a devastating blow. Strecher thought of himself as that frog. The frog doesn't recognize the danger, and before he knows it, he's dead. Strecher adds \u2014 in conversation and in his many talks \u2014 that if a live frog is put into boiling water, the frog jumps out. If, however, the frog is immersed in cold water and the water boiled slowly, the frog falls asleep and dies. For Strecher, this boiling frog is a metaphor for our lives. The image represents myriad problems \u2014 climate change and obesity, for example \u2014 and we do little or nothing about them. Typically, when people try to intervene, they use scare tactics to trigger behavior change. But scare tactics don't work. Subjects become defensive. So how is one to get that frog out of the water? Strecher is convinced that a sense of mission is key. Strecher says that when he suffered the death of someone dear to him, he lost his purpose. When he regained his sense of purpose, he felt revived. His goal now, he says, is to offer others a sense of mission. He cites Steve Jobs who, upon being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, said: \"Death is the single best invention in life. It's life's change agent.\" Strecher is a compassionate and conscientious teacher, a meticulous researcher, and an innovative entrepreneur. He is also caring, a description used by every person interviewed for this article. As an entrepreneur, Strecher's success is notable. His first coup, in 1998, was to found HealthMedia Inc. Based in Ann Arbor, the company was created to develop and disseminate tailored health interventions for health promotion, disease prevention, behavioral health, and disease management. The company's interventions benefited millions of users in North America, Europe, and Asia through health plans, employers, pharmaceutical companies and governments. Vic Strecher - A Public Health Scientist's Inquiries into Purpose By Rachel Urist Photos by Edda Pacifico \"I don't care about dying. I care about not living.\" \u2014 Professor, Visionary Businessman and Author Vic Strecher His TED Talks and recorded lectures, replete with PowerPoint presentations featuring trademark symbols from his graphic novel, On Purpose, have given him a YouTube presence and a popular culture crossover audience. \"Every life needs a purpose to which it can give the energies of its mind and the enthusiasm of its heart.\" -Saint Francis of AssisiThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 9 Strecher started the company (with Rick Snyder, Michigan's current governor), and sold it in 2008, to Johnson & Johnson. By then, the company had over 185 employees. According to Strecher, the company sold for about 175 million dollars. Today, Strecher and his wife, Jeri Rosenberg, live comfortably in the lovely Ives Woods neighborhood, in walking distance of U-M's central campus. They appreciate what they have, and they express that appreciation through philanthropy. Their generosity has benefited the University of Michigan Pediatric Cardiology Department at Mott Children's Hospital, the U-M Nursing School's Julia Strecher Scholarship Fund, the Steven Gradwohl Art of Primary Care Award, the Ann Arbor Community Foundation, SafeHouse, the Huron Valley Humane Society, and Project Grow. The couple is also involved in the local arts scene. Rosenberg, an artist, was a founding member of Wonderfool Productions, a nonprofit dedicated to encouraging public art education and presentation. She and her husband were among the founders of FestiFools and FoolMoon, annual events they continue to sustain. In 2013, the couple was presented with the Golden Paintbrush Award by the Ann Arbor Public Art Commission in recognition of the recipients' role in starting and sustaining two annual public art events, FestiFools and FoolMoon. In October 2015, the Neutral Zone celebrated Rosenberg and Strecher at its annual event honoring \"local community leaders and philanthropists for their interest in and support of the arts, both at the Neutral Zone and within the wider community.\" Strecher's current professional enterprise is JOOL Health. Its pet project is the \"JOOL App,\" a product designed to be individually tailored by and for each user. It already has over one thousand users and has helped substance abusers overcome drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and food addictions. It has also helped healthy people become healthier. The website explains that it offers: \"Purpose-driven health engagement \"Purpose-driven health engagement for individuals. Powerful analytics for organizations.\" -JOOL Health website \"What would Viktor Frankl have done now?\" Strecher's answer: \"He'd create an app to help you find your purpose.\" Similarly, he asked himself what Aristotle would do now. His best guess: \"He'd write a graphic novel!\" Strecher did both. Continued on page 10The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 10 for individuals. Powerful analytics for organizations.\" Effecting change with this app is completely private. It dispenses with embarrassing interpersonal interactions that might thwart one's desire to change. The challenge for the app user is twofold: 1. to launch oneself into the process; and 2. to persist. Once begun, the program can seem to propel itself. At JOOL Health, Strecher and his staff work not only to improve the app continually but also to create methods to assess its efficacy. David Rossiter, Chief Creative Officer of JOOL Health, notes that the app is currently available only through employers, health plans, and health systems. A consumer version of the tool may be made available in the future, both as app and in a web version. He also notes that the app is part of a larger platform that also offers, among other things, ways to participate in workshops and podcasts. Rossiter is an avid user of the app. He explained that it encourages people to reflect on their life in a manner that allows for a sharper, clearer discovery of personal purpose. It encourages users to monitor how well they're living in accordance with their stated purpose, and helps them develop the energy and willpower they need to effectively pursue it. It helps users improve the key health behaviors that support purposeful living in the areas that Strecher considers elemental: Sleep, Presence (mindfulness), Activity, Creativity, and Eating. (SPACE is the acronym Strecher has adopted.) Rossiter lists the benefits for people who use the app \u2014 even for a minute or two each. Users: Chart their SPACE, energy, willpower, alignment with their four-dimensional life purpose (personal, family, work, and community), along with two personal outcomes of their own choosing (e.g. migraines or kindness) Receive personalized tips on how to improve their health behaviors and outcomes Set and monitor progress towards personal behavioral targets Explore which personal and environmental factors have the most impact on them Receive personalized, accurate predictions for their levels of energy and willpower over the coming day, along with tips they can use to offset low predictions or capitalize on high ones Rossiter is enthusiastic about the tool. \"We're adding more features and functionality at a furious clip,\" he said. He remembers when the app was just \"a glimmer in Vic's eye.\" Rossiter mused over the work he's done with and for his current boss. We brought [the app] to its current state of maturity. It's the kind of tool it's best to spend time with. It has multiple layers of functionality that directly relate to understanding who you are, why you do what you do, how you can improve things in meaningful ways. It all starts on the premise that in our fragmented, modern life, it's easy to get separated from what's most important to you. We want people to consider what they care about most \u2014 their \"core values.\" But Rossiter is quick to point out that the app is not the only focus of the company. The core goal of the company is to help people find and succeed in their life purpose. They can use the app to achieve that. But we have other things: large-scale workshops, keynotes, videos, workbook [in progress \u2014 a companion piece to the app \u2014 and to Strecher's book], and JOOL vibe, a tool to look at the data of the population to see what's happening in the lives of the app users. Rossiter is enthusiastic about both the company and the app, which he uses daily. He said, \"I'm 64 with the energy level of my 25-year-old self. I ride my bike to work; I play guitar and sing in a musical band.\" (He has performed at Crazy Wisdom.) \"I'm a super user of the app.\" He also enthuses about his boss, who is \"an exemplar of what he's talking about: energy, will-power, stamina, purpose. He will go on the road, giving talks, sales presentations, for weeks on end, if that's what's on the schedule. He's inspiring. He takes time to get to know people.\" Danielle Butbul, one of JOOL Health's young interns, was also happy to talk about her boss. \"I really can't say enough good things about Vic \u2014 as an individual and as a co-worker,\" she said. Butbul appreciates the workspace that Strecher created. Rossiter adds: \"A lot of the joy comes from Vic. He's set up a beautiful environment, which is not typical for a start-up.\" My first meeting with Strecher took place last summer in his company's airy fourth floor suite in an industrial park on West William Street. Strecher works alongside his 14 full-time employees. In summer, there are, typically, three or four additional interns. Upon arrival, I was escorted to the kitchen \u2014 sleek and spare \u2014 and introduced to Strecher, who was seated at a counter along with six young staff members. Unaffected and unassuming, he introduced himself to me, then introduced me to the others in the room \u2014 an equal number of males and females. They were dressed casually. Each had a laptop open. Conversation flowed comfortably. After fifteen minutes, the two of us left for more private quarters; within the open and transparent spaces of JOOL Health, privacy is effected with glass walls. One staffer calls the place \"organic.\" Strecher took great pains to make his workplace match his purpose. Butbul said: Vic has put a lot of thought into designing a warm and comfortable workplace that stimulates creativity and positive energy, from the physical design of the office \u2014 which he completely renovated to be an open space office \u2014 to the furniture he chose: beautiful, comfortable, and practical, to the people who now work there \u2014 each genuinely kind, fun, and extremely impressive. Vic also made \u2014 Vic Strecher \u2014 Continued from page 9 His goal now, he says, is to offer others a sense of mission. ... Strecher uses the metaphor of a frog in a pot of water, slowly boiling to death, to represent mankind's passivity in the fact of a daunting crisis. It encourages users to monitor how well they're living in accordance with their stated purpose, and helps them develop the energy and willpower they need to effectively pursue it. \"Research shows that self-transcending values are more likely to create well-being and greater willpower to change behavior than what we might call 'self-enhancing values'\" -Winston the dung beetleThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 11 sure that there is a yoga room \u2014 we have yoga classes twice a week, a nap/meditation room, and a spacious kitchen. The space is designed to help us build creativity, activity, and presence into our day. Strecher's focus on caring is evident not only in the way he designed the workspace but in the way he relates to people around him. One staffer addressed this with the following: His deep consideration for the well-being of his co-workers is not only evident through his creation of a vibrant and comfortable workplace, but also through the way he addresses everyone in the company as being equally significant. He is also always asking how everyone is doing, and always available to answer questions and provide insight. Fun fact: this summer his desk was at the same table as all of the interns! His caring was clear to me even before I met him. Before writing this piece, I asked him whether he'd agree to be its subject. His response came with barely a moment's hesitation: \"Yes, I'll help you out.\" His response was about helping, not about being featured. While success is nothing new to Strecher, his career took a turn \u2014 and a new intensity \u2014 when his daughter died. It happened during a family vacation. Julia, an idealistic nursing student, died in her sleep. She had a history of heart disease, so her death was a shock but not a surprise. At six months, she contracted chicken pox. It affected her heart. Thereafter, the family's life was marked by frequent and harrowing hospital visits. Her first heart transplant occurred before her first birthday, her second when she was nine. There were touch-and-go moments. More than once, they thought they had lost her. On that fateful vacation, just hours before dying, she uttered words that remain indelibly etched in her father's memory: \"I'm so happy, I could die right now!\" In retrospect, those words convey a kind of reassurance, if not validation. Her parents had long struggled with how they might help their daughter have a life worth living. Her words seem to say that their efforts were not in vain. But Strecher was crushed. He began having visions of his daughter. She counseled him. She even chided him. As he kayaked into a sunrise, he saw her emerge from the sun, saying: \"You have to get over this, Dad. You have to change your life.\" From beyond the grave, Julia shepherded her father through the grieving process. He embarked on a reading binge that included the writings of great minds from ancient to current times: Aristotle, Socrates, Seneca, Nietzsche, Mozart, Shaw, Kierkegaard, Camus. Paralyzed by his loss, and in an effort to stay afloat, he devoured their words. That journey into these minds proved transformative. His response was visceral: \"As I was reading philosophers \u2014 over two thousand years old \u2014 I started feeling these were letters written for me.\" He decided that getting out of his own grief meant he should stop thinking about himself. He realized he was feeding off of this crisis, and it was all negative. He added: \"I needed to start thinking about other people, other things. Heal yourself by helping other people.\" He makes no secret that Julia's death triggered the work that drives him today. One might say he wears his heart on his sleeve to drive his point home. He decided that he would teach all his students \"as though they were Julia.\" His purpose statement is his mantra. \"My purpose is to help others create a purpose in their lives, to teach every student as if they were my own daughter, to be an engaged husband and father, and to enjoy love and beauty.\" He paused, then added: \"That's why I try hard to stay healthy. My hedonistic personal purpose is to enjoy love and beauty.\" The story of Julia's life and death figures large in each of the two recent books he wrote, yet there is nothing exhibitionistic about his display of grief. His experience, however painful, changed his life, and he uses it in the hopes that others will learn, too \u2014 without having to experience the painful loss that he suffered. The paternal, nurturing quality of Strecher's relationship with his students and co-workers is reflected in their descriptions of him. Andy Ying, a former student, rhapsodized about his teacher. Ying recalled that after each class, at least a dozen students lined up to speak to the professor, a situation Ying had never encountered before. After his first Strecher course, Ying summed up the experience by saying: \"Learning with Dr. Strecher is both purposeful and purpose-full.\" But Ying had experienced Strecher's outreach even before enrolling in his courses. During a personal crisis, Ying had approached another professor to discuss the advisability of proceeding with his long-held plan of attending medical school. Was medicine truly the right career path for him? That professor urged him to contact Strecher. Ying sent an email, and Strecher responded immediately. Ying looks back now and says: \"Most professors would have thought I was crazy. That he took time out of his busy schedule to meet with me struck a deep chord.\" Ying, who took his MCATs last summer, plans to use his medical training to enhance a career in patient care, public health, and entrepreneurship. Asked to talk about his experience as Strecher's student, Ying responded: Dr. Strecher presents the material in a transcendent way. He gives his own personal examples and invites students to do the same. Students would reveal personal stories and issues, relevant to material. He was a catalyst in helping students connect to the material. Strecher himself has no qualms about addressing the personal. Asked about the role of grief in his life, Strecher said: Grief doesn't go away. I don't want it to go away. It's a direct reflection of my love for [Julia]. I never want to forget her. This ache, this hole, should be there. The best metaphor I heard, for death of a loved one, is: if you're a tree on a mountainside, and a boulder rolls and hits the tree, the tree grows around the boulder; it doesn't go away. Asked how this experience of loss has affected his relationship with others who underwent such travails, Strecher responded: I always welcome conversations with people who've lost loved ones, but I don't feel I'm in a 'club.' Yes, we share something in loss, but I don't seek out others who've lost children. My daughter always said 'I just want to be normal.' She didn't want to go to camps for sick kids, special kids. She didn't want to give inspirational talks. That wasn't her identity. She wanted to give back. He added that he doesn't mind meeting with grieving parents, but he has no need to affiliate with these support groups. I asked about his core values, a term that figures large in his philosophy. He replied: I started thinking about what I cared about most personally. I started realizing: I love these students. I love teaching. I feel a tremendous sense of responsibility toward them. I wondered: how do I translate that into my life? My hedonistic personal purpose is to enjoy love and beauty. To me, even climbing a mountain smacks Vic has put a lot of thought into designing a warm and comfortable workplace that stimulates creativity and positive energy....

Why are they really doing this? They have families, children, but they put their lives at risk. People who perform such \"heroic\" feats \u2014 if they're doing it for something beyond themselves \u2014 then it's not heroic. It's narcissism. I asked him to name some of his \"core values.\" He said they're listed in the book. The books were checked out in the libraries, so I bought both books and found his list of \"core values\" \u2014 guiding principles that people must be able to identify in order to define and reach their goals. The list includes: achievement, community, creativity, enjoyment, expertise, independence, kindness, relationships, reputation, responsibility, security, self-control, spirituality, tradition, and vitality. He hastened to add that these principles are not carved in stone. People can and should remain flexible, even as they prioritize. Lists are malleable. The point is to achieve and maintain a sense of balance while pursuing and achieving one's goals. At the same time, one must learn to keep stress at bay. Hence the meditation. And yoga. In the course of Stretcher's mournful but productive year of binge reading, he developed a fascination with the lowly dung beetle as a symbolic representation of purposiveness. The dung beetle spends its life creating and then rolling balls of dung to their destinations. This insect navigates according to the stars \u2014 the only creature on earth that does so. Like the dung beetle, the Greek mythological figure, Sisyphus, was also destined to fulfill an endless and seemingly pointless task. Sisyphus was to push a rock to the top of a hill each day, only to see it roll back down. Note that the name \"Sisyphus,\" synonymous with scarab, is a genus of dung beetles of which there are more than 90 species. Upon closer examination of Sisyphus/scarab/dung beetle, Strecher discovered that the ancient Egyptians revered this insect. They named their god of renewal Khepri, which is the Egyptian name for dung beetle. In forming his dung ball, the scarab attracts a mate. She lays her eggs in the dung ball, then travels with her mate. Using the scarab as metaphor, the Egyptians saw Khepri as the god who pushes the sun up every morning, over the horizon, ensuring the renewal of day \u2014 the continuance of time. Albert Camus's use of the name Sisyphus was a way to recognize the value of all creatures and all positive endeavors. If one were to ask: Why do scarabs and Sisyphus persist in their respective tasks? Strecher might respond: that is the wrong question. Every living creature is destined to complete certain tasks. Our roles are assigned by time and circumstance. None of us can know in advance what our tasks in life will be. As we discover what life has assigned us, we must embrace and fulfill our roles with determination and dignity. Rather than think of Sisyphus' task as absurd, one must think of it as his purpose, nevermind that he'd need to repeat the task everlastingly. Camus ended his essay, The Myth of Sisyphus , with the words: \"One must imagine Sisyphus happy.\" Among the writers who made the greatest impact on Strecher during his mournful reading spree was Viktor Frankl (1905-1997), who viewed purpose as the kernel of hope, an essential ingredient of living. Frankl's most famous book, Man's Search for Meaning , was written after the author was liberated from Nazi concentration camps. A Viennese psychiatrist and neurologist, Frankl treated suicidal patients both before and after World War II. As a Jewish prisoner, he was a slave laborer in four different camps. In Auschwitz prisoners deliberately, and not infrequently, ran into the electric fence to kill themselves. One day, when he saw fellow prisoners about to take that route, he stopped them to ask why. They responded that they could expect nothing more from life. Frankl flipped their statement around and admonished: \"Do not ask what you expect from life; ask what life expects from you!\" Frankl understood that it is not suffering itself that causes despair. Rather, if you feel you have nothing to give and no one to love, you have nothing to live for! Frankl developed a new school of psychology called \"logotherapy,\" based on a philosophy that we are strongly motivated to live purposefully and meaningfully. Finding one's purpose is key. When we respond positively to life's challenges, we find meaning in life. By drawing on a person's strengths, logotherapy can bring about a profound shift in awareness. Since Frankl believed that a major cause of depression is self-absorption, he posited that patients can move from a victim mentality to an optimistic outlook. Frankl further posited that: Only to the extent that someone is living out this self-transcendence of human existence is he truly human or does he become his true self. He becomes so not by concerning himself with his self's actualization, but by forgetting himself and giving himself, overlooking himself and focusing outward. This notion of transcendence became central to Strecher's theories of how people can change and improve their lives. In an age of \"selfies\" that follows on the heels of the \"me generation,\" transcending oneself for the greater good proves far more gratifying than simply \"actualizing\" oneself in a personally ambitious, self-centered, and ultimately less satisfying way. Strecher draws on countless research studies that prove this. As Strecher contemplated the writers he read, he became intensely aware of the centrality of purpose in their philosophies \u2014 and in life. He calls Seneca \"an Ann Landers of ancient Rome,\" and cited a letter in which a woman, writing at her son's graveside, asked \"It doesn't matter how much wind is in your sails if you don't have a harbor.\" Strecher also cited Socrates' famous saying: \"The unexamined less well-known response: \"Yes, but the purposeless life isn't even worth examining.\" In their writings, both Frankl and Strecher quoted Nietzsche, who also weighed in on this point: \"He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.\" In Life on Purpose, Strecher discusses Aristotle's use of the word \"Eudaimonia\" to mean the true self. One's daimon is what's true and most divine inside us. The authentic self transcends one's ego-focused desires. Aristotle said that the self-transcending state of Eudaimonia contrasts with the self-enhancing \"hedonia\" (as in \"hedonism\"), which concerns the pursuit of (short-term) pleasure. Strecher, being the researcher he is, points out that recent studies have shown that people who score high on the eudaimonic (v. hedonic) scale are healthier. More specifically, they show \"less inflammatory gene expression.\" Strecher also points out, that according to the latest research, roughly half the disease and deaths in the U.S. are caused by lifestyle \u2014 in other words, by our behaviors. (He said this in his \"Vic Strecher TEDMED 2009\" talk, https://youtu.be/bxMGuGUROiA). Strecher had already intuited this phenomenon when he embarked on his most recent contribution to public health: the creation of the JOOL app. In approaching his self-appointed task of making his findings useful to the public, Strecher asked himself: \"What would Viktor Frankl have done now?\" Strecher's answer: \"He'd create an app to help you find your purpose.\" Similarly, he asked himself what Aristotle would do now. His best guess: \"He'd write a graphic novel!\" Strecher did both. \u2014 Vic Strecher \u2014 Continued from page 11 Using the scarab as metaphor, the Egyptians saw Khepri as the god who pushes the sun up every morning, over the horizon, ensuring the renewal of day \u2014 the continuance of time. As we discover what life has assigned us, we must embrace and fulfill our roles with determination and dignity. \"Do not ask what you expect from life; ask what life expects from imagine Sisyphus happy.\" Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 13 The breadth of Strecher's professional literacy shows itself in his frequent mention of researchers at work in his areas of interest. Among the many he cites is Elizabeth Blackburn (author of The Telomere Effect ), who won the 2009 Nobel Prize in medicine for discovering the role of telomeres at the end of our chromosomes. Telomeres, like the protective caps on shoelaces, keep our chromosomes from fraying. We're more likely to get sick when our telomeres shrink, which makes our chromosomes more susceptible to damage. An inability to cope with stress can shorten our telomeres. Scientists have discovered that telomerase, an enzyme that helps repair damaged chromosomes, may carry anti-aging properties. It may, in time, be used to fight cancer and improve the quality of other medical treatments. Strecher names dozens of other university researchers. They include Emily Falk; Jennifer Crocker; David Yeager; Frans de Waal \u2014 who concluded that it's \"nature, not just nurture, that promotes empathy and altruism\"; Adam Grant \u2014 who urges people to be \"helpful and altruistic\" while preserving their own goals (\"Don't be a chump!\"); Edith Chen and Greg Miller \u2014 whose \"shift-and-persist\" axiom emerges from their deduction: \"To adjust to life's stresses, making shifts in perception, when it's accompanied by a persistent pursuit of a goal, helps.\" Vic Strecher has no plans to slow down. If and when he is satisfied with the JOOL app, he will move on to future innovations. He remains helpmeet to his wife, who treasures his companionship. His elder daughter, a professional photographer, remains devoted to her dad and has made him a grandfather, a role he reveres. Strecher does not lack for purpose, and he continues to extol transcendence over self-enhancement. Winston, his alter ego, has much to say on this last point, the egotistical versus communal impulse: Research shows that self-transcending values are more likely to create well-being and greater willpower to change behavior than what we might call \"self-enhancing values\"; and that college graduates who placed importance upon close relationships, community involvement and personal growth were, two years later, more likely to have achieved these goals and to have greater well-being, whereas graduates who aspired more to money, fame, and appearance were, two years later, more likely to have achieved these goals but had greater ill-being. Strecher's drive to help others find purpose is, within his circles, legendary. Again, in Winston's words: People with a purpose appear to be more likely to avoid illnesses. In fact [researchers found], people with a low purpose in life were more than twice as likely to get Alzheimer's disease than people with high purpose in life. Having a purpose is associated with living longer! Having a purpose is associated with well-being: happiness, better sleep, even better sex! If Winston were real, he might be pleased to know that in today's world, the dung beetle is highly valued, especially among cattle-raising farmers in Australia who import the bugs to nourish their pastures. Flies, too, process dung, but flies carry disease. The dung beetles do the job with utmost efficiency and no collateral damage. ### \"To adjust to life's stresses, making shifts in perception, when it's accompanied by a persistent pursuit of a goal, helps.\" In a Fractured, Divisive World, the P oets of All the Nations Guide the Way Toward P eace The Parliament of Poets An Epic Poem By Frederick Glaysher \"A profound spiritual message for humanity .\" \u2014Alan Jacobs, Ramana Maharshi F oundation UK \"I am in awe of the brilliance of this book!

At first I thought \"Narratives of Pain\" was an indie-satirical play on words, or perhaps an improv comedy showcase with a dark twist. But after some online investigation, I learned that Narratives of Pain is \"a community storytelling experience aimed at individual and collective healing, as well as quality entertainment.\" Someone had chosen to not only dive into, but publicly address and provide a venue for, those human experiences which are sometimes shunned, derided, or otherwise only talked about behind closed doors? I needed to know more! I attended the winter showcase in 2015 and was moved by the diverse array of talent: poets, storytellers, songstresses, rappers, and other folks hollering, laughing, crying, whispering, and talking through some of the harder aspects of their humanity. What a gift it is to witness someone in their healing process and to feel moved by their courage and creativity to take the mic and share their story. Similar in feel to \"The Moth StorySLAM,\" what makes Narratives unique is that it is purposefully created and contained to be a healing venue. Their tagline is: \"Healing Through the Telling and Witnessing of Stories.\" After the event, I followed up over coffee with Zain Shamoon, the soft-spoken visionary behind Narratives of Pain, to learn more about his personal background and inspiration for creating Narratives, as well as future goals. Who are you, and how did Narratives of Pain get started? I am a family therapist and, at the time we started Narratives of Pain, I was also the Creative Director for the Institute of Muslim Mental Health. At our professional conference every year, most of the presentations were academic or professional in nature. But in 2015, my friend Hammad Ali and I decided to make something different together. \"I trust myself as an artist, and as a therapist \u2014 is there a way to put those worlds together?\" And so we put on a storytelling session. That first Narratives of Pain show was received really well. Approximately 100 people attended, and it was also promoted to the public. People said, \"Keep doing this,\" \"We need this.\" From the start, it was my intention to make the storytelling show a separate entity from the conference, so the conference was the unveiling.It was very important to us to strip down the show and make sure the storytellers didn't have to be artists. They could make the art for themselves and for their own catharsis \u2014 not for the audience, but for themselves. So there is no right or wrong or good or bad, and \"no shaming\" is our biggest rule. Our Narratives team is personally responsible for making sure that happens. We went on to produce more shows in other locations, such as Novi, Warren, Ann Arbor, and even at the Detroit Institute of Arts. As of January 2017, we have had eight shows and try to offer them every two or three months. We also continue to produce a show at the Muslim Mental Health Conference each year.Coffee with Zain Shamoon, Co-founder and Host of the \"Narratives of Pain\" Storytelling Showcase By Sara Vos Photographs by Joni Strickfaden Storytelling is practicing resiliency and forgiveness. Forgiveness is not a passive thing. Forgiveness is an active thing; you need to go to the site of the wounding and practice active spiritual forgiveness around that... Telling your story to an audience matters...because people deserve to feel that their pain is valid. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 15 How did you know how to do this? I had done a lot of performance art, including spoken word, hip-hop, and music production, and was inspired by Def Poetry Jam [a former HBO-TV show], The Moth storytelling show, the play \"Vagina Monologues,\" and even Alcoholics Anonymous\u2014 avenues where people can share and also get support. I've directed and performed in theatrical showcases. I used to put on a show called \"Tunnel of Oppression\" at MSU with actors that was more scripted, so I wanted to continue that, but in a new and more personal way. Sometimes, as artists and activists, we create the very things we wish we would've had in our own lives; we fill gaps. If you're comfortable sharing, why did you create Narratives of Pain, or what motivates you to keep it going? I have a lot of personal conviction for it. Sharing my own stories of alienation in writing and performance has been a healing outlet for me, so now I'm trying to give back to the community. I need to be part of healing spaces for my own emotional survival. It's been a journey to find a home with that. Narratives has felt the best so far. It's amazing why people gravitate towards the Narratives space. It's either people who've been waiting to tell their stories \u2014 and either they're finally ready to be honest with themselves about it, or to be honest with other people about it \u2014 or they're people who've been suffering here and there in different moments in their life, and they need spaces like these. Some wounds in life require looking at. Storytelling is practicing resiliency and forgiveness. Forgiveness is not a passive thing. Forgiveness is an active thing; you need to go to the site of the wounding and practice active spiritual forgiveness around that, or else it's just a mental game of \"pretend.\" You have to be willing to go through the process. Narratives of Pain can be part of that process for some people. Why does telling your story to an audience matter? Why not just journal, for example? Because people deserve to feel that their pain is valid. One of the most exhausting things in the world is experiencing observable, felt pain, and either you tell yourself (or the world tells you) it doesn't exist \u2014 or that it shouldn't exist, or that you created it. What does it mean THEN to radically say, \"Nope, that's my pain!,\" and have other people honor that? It takes courage to take care of yourself like that. What do the witnesses contribute to the space by being there? First: Validation \u2014 of each other, and the storytellers. Second: The opportunity to gain courage. Audience members can tell their own stories at the end, in the open mic portion, and they are the holders. It's the witnessing itself that allows the healing to happen for the storyteller. Do you have a vision for Narratives of Pain? Yes \u2014 maintaining what we're doing. In 2016, it became a nonprofit. We want to keep doing it. This thing does not go away. Healing is a journey. Healing is multifaceted. The show helps to alleviate pain, but it's also about refreshment. Confronting pain is basic-level healthcare. Wellness is about adding health. It's about bringing you back into balance. I think people deserve to feel healthy! How can people participate or be involved? Come witness. Story-tell. If you want to learn how to help people heal through reframing or telling their stories, talk to us. People can also help by being honest about what's hurting in their own lives. People who want to be featured storytellers in the first hour of the show can contact me through our Facebook page. Then the second half of the show is like an open mic, where people can sign up onsite to share their own stories after being inspired by the storytellers in the first half. I believe that people are the gatekeepers to their own experience \u2014 nobody else can be. Within that gate, there is pain \u2014 and they have to access it, and they have to let it out. I hope we can be a part of that for people who need it. We can create structure, allow stories, and help them find that conviction within themselves.

It's more about what men and boys are taught to value and aspire to,\" she said. In our culture, most men are taught that it's not okay to be soft, to be emotional or even spiritual. This idea is reinforced by everything from mass media to peer pressure: men are supposed to be strong, period. It's somewhat ironic, then, that yoga, which actually builds strength and stamina, tends to be avoided by men. So we must ask ourselves whether yoga classes that are primarily women are inadvertently perpetuating the idea that men don't have a place in them. Is that the message we want to send? As women who practice regularly, what can we do to make yoga studios more welcoming for men? Gotlib finds that the best way to get men on a yoga mat is via a male friend or someone they're dating. Even so, she has found that once you get them to a class, getting them to come back may be the hardest part. Making yoga seem welcoming is one thing, but making it enjoyable and worthwhile is another one entirely. This responsibility falls more to the teacher than the students. \"A man may feel more comfortable with a male teacher,\" speculated Ann Arbor yoga instructor Scott Carter, who can be found at A2 Yoga, Red Yoga, The YMCA, and ProFit. Carter has been teaching since 2005, and before that he was an athlete. Hockey, motocross, dirt biking, and other fast-paced sports were a part of his life, and that influences the way he teaches now. It could be why he has so many men attending his classes. \"The speech that I use is not full-on hippie,\" Carter said. \"The verbiage I use is what I would want to hear as an athlete that doesn't know much about yoga but wants to move my body.\" This is different than the approach I've seen from female teachers in all the classes I've personally been to. I can see where Carter's style would appeal to men, when athleticism is most likely what they're more familiar with. But Carter isn't convinced that his gender alone is enough to draw in more male students: \"I don't know that I offer something that is much different than a woman teacher; people say I hold the same energy.\" I am settling into my breath. I am on my mat, in a yoga class, lying down before it begins. Eyes closed, I hear the door open and several pairs of feet pad their way into the warm room. When I finally sit up and glance around, I see I am surrounded by women \u2014 where are all the men? In my experience, this isn't unusual. Most classes that I attend are almost all women, almost all the time. In a world where many forms of physical activity are dominated by men, why aren't there more men taking yoga classes? According to the 2016 Yoga in America Study by Yoga Journal and Yoga Alliance, 37 million Americans are actively practicing yoga (a practitioner is defined as someone who has practiced within the last six months). Of the 37 million practitioners, 72 percent are female. According to the American Osteopathic Association, yoga can increase flexibility, increase muscle tone and strength, improve respiration and athletic performance, and prevent injury. Yoga provides tangible benefits that should attract anyone interested in bettering themselves physically. So why is it that mostly women are reaping these benefits? I can speculate. For me, my yoga practice is personal and deeply feminine. While I'm on my mat, I feel that I'm embodying the characteristics I see my ideal woman self as having: strength, grace, awareness, patience, and self-love. Yoga for me is a time to dive deeply into myself and my strength, mentally and physically. It is a time to connect my body with my mind, and one of the only times out of the day when I can truly turn off my thoughts. My practice is raw, strong, beautiful, and something I constantly work at as a living thing in my life. I suspect many other female practitioners view yoga in similar ways. I spoke with Risa Gotlib, owner of Tiny Buddha Yoga, a newcomer to Ann Arbor's long-standing yoga scene but a positive space and my personal place of practice. Classes at Tiny Buddha are mostly women; the classes I attend typically have no more than four men, compared to about 20 or so women. Gotlib shared a thoughtful perspective on why men are more reluctant to tap into the benefits of yoga. \"I think it's more a conversation about how men are socialized The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 16 Y oga \u2014 Not for Women Only By Chelsea Hohn According to the 2016 Y oga in America Study, 37 million Americans are actively practicing yoga. Of the 37 million practitioners, 72 percent are female. In our culture, most men are taught that it's not okay to be soft, to be emotional or even spiritual: men are supposed to be strong, period. It's somewhat ironic, then, that yoga, which actually builds strength and stamina, tends to be avoided by men. Myths and Misconceptions Keep Many Men Away from Y oga Studios Photos courtesy of Yoga teacher Scott CarterThe physical strength of yoga brings some men into the practice, but what about the spiritual part of yoga, the \"hippie verbiage\" and all the benefits that can't be seen on a surface level? According to Harvard Medical School, yoga can cause one to develop a better body image through inner awareness; it can boost weight loss, lead to healthier eating habits, and provide cardiovascular benefits. However, this connection to \"inner awareness\" can seem off-putting to some people. Yoga began as meditation and was a key part of religious texts. Ancient yoga is flushed with religion and prayer \u2014 things modern men and women aren't as familiar with. When asked to sit silently, many of us struggle to turn our thoughts inward, and to turn the mind's volume down. Most of us are simply not used to slipping into quiet reflection or prayer to find a spiritual connection. Combine this lack of inner awareness with a completely new space dominated by the opposite sex, and it's easy to see why accessing yoga's spiritual dimensions might be especially difficult for men. This is unfortunate. For me, the spiritual element of yoga is cultivated inside and manifests in my life as patience, understanding, the ability to love others without judgment or competition, and to celebrate the successes of others without jealousy. I come to the practice because it releases the burrs of life that stick to the outside of my brain. When someone asks me why I do yoga, my answer is usually, \"It's cheaper than therapy, and just as good for my mind, and better for my body.\" Carter recognizes that everyone has this same mind-body-spirit connection, whether they're tapped into it or not, and he encourages them to develop it. He works closely with his students in each pose, making adjustments and cueing deep breaths. He asks his students to ask themselves if they need more or less in a given pose. That starts the conversation within the self, between mind and body, which opens a connection that is spiritual by nature. \"Once you start asking 'What are my needs?' it starts to create intimacy within the physical body,\" said Carter. He tries to remind his students of their power and their strength. Through this empowerment, he also teaches them to be okay with sensation, to be okay with themselves, and to be okay with forging a spiritual connection. This can ultimately lead to a student being okay as a man in a yoga studio full of women. Carter is confident that yoga has something to offer every student, regardless of gender and regardless of the level on which they approach it. \"At the end of the day, at least you are breathing and moving your body,\" said Carter of yoga practice. \"If you get something more \u2014 awesome.\" So what will it take to bring more men into the rewarding practice of yoga? First and foremost, it will take better awareness of the myths and misconceptions that overemphasize women's participation while overlooking men's. In other words, it takes ordinary men being open-minded enough to give yoga a chance. It takes men like Scott Carter, who lead classes in a supportive way that allows men to open up to their bodies and to their spirituality in a comfortable setting. It takes men like Tom Waters, who are comfortable enough with themselves to defy society's norms, to introduce other men to yoga, and to show that manhood and yoga can coexist. More than anything, it takes the women who make up the classes. If we're open, receptive, and supportive of men joining our community, men might be able to experience the benefits women have claimed \u2014 and we would all benefit from that. ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 17 I asked Carter why he thinks so many more women than men are drawn to yoga. He had a simple answer: \"I think the reason is because it's promoted as yoga is a women's thing.\" I think he's right. Take the popular magazine Yoga Journal \u2014 an overwhelming number of their covers feature women. Almost every yoga-centric clothing brand features a woman in their ads, and all of the marketing is directed to women. Companies like Lole, Beyond Yoga, and Athleta don't even offer men's clothing. Even Lululemon, Prana, and Onzie, companies that do offer men's yoga clothes, rarely feature a man in their ads. Carter continued, \"When you say yoga, the first thing in your mind is a woman that is soft and flexible \u2014 it's not masculine.\" Softness and flexibility aren't exactly priorities for most men, and in fact, women do have the upper hand in terms of flexibility. According to a study done by Katherine Whitcome of Harvard University, the female spine has evolved to accommodate pregnancy by being more flexible. In addition, most women have less muscle mass than men, making flexibility more accessible to women on average. So while men go to the gym and build muscles, women go to the yoga studio and build flexibility in a gentle, low-impact way. But despite this perception of gentleness, anyone who has taken a hot vinyasa class and left with legs made of Jell-o and a completely soaked shirt can attest that yoga isn't all soft. As Carter said, \"There is strength and there is power.\" Yoga can build strong beautiful bodies, confidence, and mental stability \u2014 qualities that compliment both genders. How do we \"sell\" yoga to men, then? Carter does it by framing it as injury protection, a supplement to rigorous physical activity and a way to ensure longevity. He has friends who are professional athletes that do yoga, and he finds that once other men catch wind of that, they realize yoga can be both athletic and beneficial. In actual practice, there is nothing that makes yoga an inherently \"male\" or \"female\" discipline. It wasn't until the Western world got a hold of yoga that it started to get handed over to women; yoga was actually developed by men. Some five thousand years ago in India, it began as various forms of meditation, and was written about in ancient scriptures by male Vedic priests. The body wasn't even a factor in yoga until two thousand years later; asanas (poses) and physicality were late to the yogic game. The yoga we practice now is primarily due to the efforts of well-known yogi B.K.S. Iyengar, who popularized it in the U.S. So let's turn the question. Why are there fewer women in a sport like football? Strength, bulk, speed, and power are important components of being a successful football player. These characteristics are typically more common in men. Is yoga less attractive to men because it's harder for them? Tom Waters, 32, started practicing yoga when he was 20 years old, and he said it was much harder than he had ever anticipated. Waters kept practicing because he wanted to take care of his body, and now his practice is helping to keep him in shape. He finds it calming, and he enjoys both the physical and mental aspects. \"It's a total reset,\" he explained. \"It's the easiest and most productive, healthy way to shed a bad day or week.\" For him, yoga is a way to release thoughts and emotions and get a new perspective on things, but he understands the stigmas that come with yoga for men and why others may be unsure about it. For instance, going into something new can be intimidating, especially as a man in an activity dominated by women. \"It's pretty exposing,\" Waters acknowledged. I agree with him: yoga can expose your weaknesses \u2014 to classmates and to yourself. \"The discipline in yoga and the postures require you to push through and not sacrifice your posture, which means the only lever you can release is your mental ability to deal with pain,\" Waters said. \"I think guys don't think about that.\" Waters also made a point about yoga classes that I was completely blind to. He is sensitive to the fact that he is in a room full of attractive, healthy women that often wear semi-exposing or tight clothing, and he doesn't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable. Take, for example, a full class doing a wide-leg forward-fold. If mats are parallel, your head comes into close quarters with another's behind, and it can be awkward. Waters' awareness comes from a place of wanting to make sure everyone feels comfortable, and hoping classmates understand he is there for himself, not for a look at anyone else. I asked yoga teacher Scott Carter why he thinks so many more women than men are drawn to yoga. He had a simple answer: \"I think the reason is because it's promoted as yoga is a women's thing.\" How do we \"sell\" yoga to men, then? Carter does it by framing it as injury protection, a supplement to rigorous physical activity and a way to ensure longevity. In actual practice, there is nothing that makes yoga an inherently \"male\" or \"female\" discipline. It wasn't until the Western world got a hold of yoga that it started to get handed over to women; yoga was actually developed by men. When someone asks me why I do yoga, my answer is usually, \"It's cheaper than therapy, and just as good for my mind, and better for my body.\" Deep for_li.cdicacioa11cl Sp1nwal lnc1m1y OSpring Center Evenings with Aaron channeled by Barbara Brodsky May 10 Local and Online Sunday Group Meditation Meditation: 5 pm-6 30 pm (5-6 meditation; 6-6 30 mindful sharing All are Welcome! -No experience necessary Evening Workshop Barbara Brodsky and Tavis Taylor, MD May 24 Local and Online Oakwood Silent Retreat Barbara Brodsky, John Orr and Aaron Oct. 23 -Oct. 29 Selma, IN Insight Meditation and Spiritual Inquiry Silent Retreats I Weekly Sittings I Classes I Workshops Beginning to Advanced Study I Offering local and online participation Yoga teacher Scott CarterIn this column, Crysta Coburn writes about crazywisdom-esque people and happenings around Ann Arbor.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 18 12Supporting Women's Health with Emily Buchler When I saw local jewelry artist Emily Buchler's new project, Lady Glitter Bits (\"Handmade Jewelry Celebrating the Divine Feminine), I knew I needed to hear her story. Emily is also the artist behind Woodland Caravan (\"Handcrafted Jewelry and Vintage Clothing\"). Being a lifetime fan of fantasy and all things magical, I was long ago drawn to Woodland Caravan's earthy, spiritual, and enchanting aesthetic. The Etsy shop, opened in 2011, currently features over 150 items ranging from Forest Spirit, Celtic, and Om earrings to Cat Fae, Pirate, and Enchanting Mermaid bookmarks to Romantic Vintage Art pendants and Faery Crystal necklaces. You will also find select vintage clothing pieces from the 1960s through 1990s. All reflect Emily's own colorful, Bohemian style. Her new Etsy shop and line of jewelry, Lady Glitter Bits, came about when Emily was feeling a slump in creativity for Woodland Caravan. \"[I'd] been kind of in a rut,\" she told me. Just playing around, she made a few of what would later be named Glitter Bits and \"it was really fun!\" The shop was launched to coincide with the epic Women's March on Washington in January of this year. The name \"Lady Glitter Bits,\" in case you haven't guessed, is a reference to women's outer genitalia (which sounds so boring when put that way). The whimsical yoni pendants are sculpted from polymer clay across a spectrum of jewel tones. They come in various, mostly innocuous, shapes and incorporate beads, buttons, and other cute little sundries, such as owls, cats, flowers, and stones. They bear names like \"Bohemian Faerie,\" Lady Emily, as she is named on Etsy, wanted to do something to draw attention to women's health. Thus, \"10 percent of your purchase will be donated to the wonderful Days for Girls foundation, which focuses on women's health and sustainability.\" She also enjoys the handmade aspect of all her products. \"It's cool because with the society we're in right now, you buy something and you're not super attached to it.... It falls apart really quick and you're like 'Eh, whatever,' and throw it out. But if you buy something that's handmade, someone's time was spent making it. It's more special somehow.\" Emily sells her wares both online via Etsy (\"There's not much overhead!\") and occasionally at local events and craft fairs, where she is often joined by her husband, Sheldon Buchler. Sheldon is a product photographer and graphic designer and does all of the photography for his wife's shops.

The universe reminded me of this when my husband came home one night after attending an event at Grove Studios in Ypsilanti \u2014 a new community practice space and studio for musicians \u2014 and handed me the card of Alexis Ford, an artist and organizer at Grove. You see, when I was a young teen, I wrote my first novel with a friend who had a friend who was a talented comic artist. On one visit, she asked her friend to draw character designs for our novel. That artist's name was \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 Alexis Ford. Alexis no longer makes comics, saying, \"They are exceedingly time consuming, and it's near impossible to become an artist who can pull in some income. Kudos to those who work in the format.\" She is still a fan of comics, though, especially those \"made for girls.\" \"Currently I'm collecting Paper Girls, Jem, and Power Rangers: Pink.\" After graduating high school, Alexis \"started doing gig posters instead of comics because it was an easy way to do illustrations, see [them] on display all over town, and get paid a little bit for it.\" She is currently finishing her B.S.A. in Drawing from Eastern Michigan University. Alexis also has a background in music and currently plays \"bass guitar and an odd electronic instrument called an Omnichord.\" She moved to Ypsilanti about 12 years ago, and her life was filled with music, \"living in a punk house where [they] held shows.\" She got involved at Grove Studios when founder Rick Coughlin contacted her about hosting pop-up performances and art galleries with her organization, the Music & Arts Guild. Rick opened Grove Studios last year, and while his primary focus is to provide studio space to musicians and bands, he approached Stefanie about hosting events and art galleries as a way to raise money to eventually purchase the property, which he is currently renting. Stefanie's organization, the Music & Arts Guild, has been in operation for three years as a nonprofit collective of musicians and artists. In addition to providing networking opportunities, the group also puts on workshops and music and art showcases. When Rick approached her about collaborating with Grove Studios, she didn't hesitate to say yes. \"The rest is an ongoing project!\" she said. She called Grove \"a big dream \u2014 but not an unrealistic one,\" further adding, \"The idea is to have quality musicians' work spaces in a brightly lit, easy-to-get-to location with 24/7 access and ample parking.... Six bands currently find their homes at the location at 1145 W. Michigan Avenue, and we have space to add more to that roster. The current building design and the partnership with the Music & Arts Guild allows us to be open every Friday for small performances and gallery shows.\" In March of this year, Grove Studios won the Pitch Ypsi competition and was awarded $5,000.Local artist Emily Buchler's new project is called \"Lady Glitter Bits.\" The CRYSTA GOES VISITING Alexis Ford is a musician, artist, and president of the Music & Arts Guild. Her latest collaboration is with Grove Studios, a community practice space for musicians in Ypsilanti. Her self-portrait is pictured above.

An Army of Peppers and Tomatoes with Stefanie Stauffer When I asked Stefanie Stauffer, of Nightshade Farm Industries (formerly known as Nightshade Army), what inspired her to start a farm-based business, she answered, \"It more found me.\" Stefanie has no formal training as a farmer, learning from her peers and other, more experienced farmers. She has volunteered with Growing Hope and Food Gatherers. But, she affirmed, \"It's a constant learning process.\" Nightshade Farm Industries is a small plot intensive, no spray vegetable farm known for heirloom tomatoes, peppers, and other nightshade family produce. 2017 is Stefanie's eighth season in business and ninth season growing. \"My first real food growing experience was just in 2009 at Frog Island Community Garden in [Ypsilanti].\" After former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm signed the Cottage Food bills into law in 2010 (the ceremony took place at Growing Hope), Stefanie began to use her \"excess garden stuff to make hot sauce\" \u2014 the best hot sauce, according to my friend's husband, who is known for his love of heat and has an impressive hot sauce collection. Under the Cottage Food Law, non-potentially hazardous foods that do not require time and/or temperature control for safety can be produced in a home kitchen for direct sale to customers at farmers' markets, farm markets, roadside stands or other direct markets. The name Nightshade Farm Industries comes from the plants that Stefanie specializes in \u2014 peppers and tomatoes, which are both in the nightshade plant family. This year, she has also added garlic to the roster, a key ingredient for her salsa. It is a seasonal fresh produce farm that \"celebrat[es] heirloom varieties.\" Stefanie is the grower as well as the maker of small batches of salsas, single varietal chili powders, garlic chili paste, hot sauces, and more. She has no staff. \"Products are available seasonally and while supplies last.\" Though they double the workload, the salsas, sauces, and other products are a perfect way to make use of \"produce that might not sell in traditional markets,\" so less food goes to waste. Stefanie is also the program manager at the Tilian Farm Development Center \u2014 protected farmland owned by Ann Arbor Township \u2014 where she also grows her produce. \"I'm growing on less than a third of an acre,\" Stefanie told me. In 2016 she had 550 tomato plants and 600 pepper plants, 400 hot and 200 sweet, and the harvesting season lasted from the middle of June to mid-November. This year, seedlings started March 1 in the hoop house (a simple kind of greenhouse). Stefanie is a familiar face at the Saturday Ypsilanti farmers' market in Depot Town and events like DIYpsi, which is where I first met her, introduced by Jen Gossett of Fairytale Baked Goods (whom I interviewed for Issue 63 of CW Journal ). You can also find Nightshade Farm products at the Argus Farm Stop in Ann Arbor and the Farmers Hand in Detroit. But for the fun and goofy products like hot pepper candies, you need to stop by DIYpsi.

Raised and educated in a Tibetan monastery, he was forced to flee for his life in 1959 as a result of the Chinese occupation, and fled to India. In the 1970s, his teachers, who were also teachers to His Holiness the Dalai Lama, directed Rimpoche to teach Western students of Tibetan Buddhism. Rimpoche was especially known for his familiarity with modern Western culture, making him a very effective teacher. His connection to Michigan began in late 1980, when he met a young woman, Aura Glaser (who had been raised and educated in this area), in Dharamsala in front of the Tibetan Library. Glaser provided an abbreviated recounting, in writing: \"As a result of my meeting Rimpoche, (my friend) Sandy Finkel was introduced to him in New Delhi a few weeks later, in January 1981. We studied intensively with Rimpoche in New Delhi and returned to the States, and to Ann Arbor, later in 1981. I opened Crazy Wisdom on the vernal equinox of 1982. Rimpoche was in India at the time and did not have a direct part in my opening or naming the bookstore... Sandy and I invited Rimpoche to the United States not long after our return but he was completing some projects and told us he wouldn't be able to come until 1984. We brought him to the States (we bought his airline ticket with money we didn't have), and directly to Ann Arbor, in September of 1984. It was then that we sponsored his first teachings here.\" Jewel Heart was founded in 1988.Gelek Rimpoche's collected works include over 32 transcripts of his teachings, numerous articles as well as the book, Good Life, Good Death (Riverhead Books 2001) and the Tara Box: Rituals for Protection and Healing from the Female Buddha (New World Library 2004). Rimpoche traveled widely throughout the United States, Europe, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore on the invitation of many Buddhist centers, universities, conferences, and retreat centers, sharing his understanding of Tibetan Buddhism and supporting Tibetan culture. His dear friend and student, Glenn Mullin, said that Rimpoche was so prolific and skilled in each of these activities that any one of them could have been the work of a whole lifetime. This ongoing column features upcoming events within Ann Arbor/Washtenaw County and surrounding areas' Body/ Mind/Spirit communities, new (during the past year or two) practitioners and holistic businesses, new books written by local/regional authors, new classes, as well as new offerings by established practitioners and holistic businesses. \"We are committed to following Gelek Rimpoche's wish to help others and will continue to make his life's work authentically accessible to those with interest at any level.\" - Kathy Laritz, Jewel Heart Program Director Gelek Rimpoche, founder of Ann Arbor's Jewel Heart Tibetan Buddhist Center, passed away on February 15, 2017 Jewel Heart will continue to offer retreats, workshops, events, and Sunday programs and meditations. There will be a retreat this summer, July 29 to August 5, called \"GPS For Your Spiritual Journey.\" Photo by Kathleen Foxworthy LaritzThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 21 Continued on page 22 New Offerings by Established Businesses and PractitionersWhile in the hospital the week before he passed away, Rimpoche directed his students to go forward with the scheduled week-long retreat that would have hosted him as the primary speaker. In addition, a special White Tara Initiation with Rimpoche was scheduled at the U-M Michigan Union the Saturday before he died. Wanting the program to continue, Rimpoche requested that two of his students lead the meditation while he remained in the hospital. In discussing Rimpoche's passing, Jewel Heart's program director, Kathy Laritz, explained that, after physical passing, Tibetan Buddhist lamas may stay in the body in deep meditation for a period of time. While Rimpoche was in this state, monks and other Rimpoches from Tibet and various locations quickly arrived at the hospital to manage arrangements and begin traditional prayers. [\"Rimpoche\" is an honorific title attributed to reincarnated lamas meaning Precious One.] When those who had returned home from the U-M White Tara retreat received word that he had died, many immediately flew back to Ann Arbor, some from as far away as the Netherlands and Singapore. Continuous prayers and ceremonies were given for several days both at the Jewel Heart Center and at the Nie funeral home, where his students (whom he always called his \"friends\") could be near him while he was in the meditative state. On Saturday, February 18, his body was cremated. Relics were collected from his body and brought back to the Jewel Heart Center for a Relic Blessing Ceremony that afternoon. \"Rimpoche has been preparing us for his death,\" said Laritz, \"and everyone joined together to carry out his wishes.\" Rimpoche's wishes, said Laritz, included carrying on the activities of Jewel Heart in his absence. \"You could say that Jewel Heart and Gelek Rimpoche are synonymous,\" she said. One aspect of Rimpoche's life work was guiding his students to become instructors themselves, and Jewel Heart will continue to invite the various teachers and guest speakers that Rimpoche has included in programs over the years. The Center has a vast archive of his teachings with audio/video recordings and both digital and paperback transcripts dating back over 30 years. Jewel Heart has chapters in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan; Chicago; Cleveland; Houston; Lincoln, Nebraska; New York; Pittsburgh and Philadelphia; Malaysia and the Netherlands. Jewel Heart will continue to offer retreats, workshops, events, and Sunday programs and meditations. There will be a retreat this summer, from July 29 to August 5, called \"GPS For Your Spiritual Journey.\" Laritz said, \"We are committed to following Gelek Rimpoche's wish to help others and will continue to make his life's work authentically accessible to those with interest at any level.\" Jewel Heart's website, www.jewelheart.org, has a page for remembrances of Gelek Rimpoche, as well as information about continuing offerings at the Center.

The space features bathrooms, a changing area, and over 6,500 square feet of dance floor. Peters said the space is about 15 times larger than the previous venue, and while he currently attracts a group of about 25 students weekly, he hopes to build up to 100 as the space will allow it. The arrangement is on a trial basis, but Peters said that it is working out well. Dance Meditation Technique is a meditation practice, a workout, and an unchoreographed dance in a non-judgmental setting. Sunday practice begins at 10:00 a.m. and ends around noon, though people often socialize afterward until as late as 1:30 p.m. Feed People, a healthy catering and nutrition business, has been providing brunch. Peters will also offer a three-and-a-half-day weekend immersion DMT teacher training June 22 through 25. The location is to be announced, but will most likely be in Grass Lake, Michigan. Students must register by May 11 so they can begin the prerequisite training, which is done by phone or Skype with Peters. Training is also provided after the immersion weekend for those who want to start teaching their own DMT classes. Peters said that this process can guide someone with no teaching experience to successfully teaching their own classes. Michael Peters can be reached at michael@dancemt.com or (248) 910-3351. His website is www.dancemt.com. Husband and wife team Dr. Cheryl Wong and Evan LeBow-Wolf opened Ann Arbor Community Acupuncture (AACA) in March of 2015. In February of this year, they completed the process to become a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, which had been a longtime goal of theirs. The clinic will now be known as the Ann Arbor Community Acupuncture Project. Wong and Lebow-Wolf follow a model that many clinics have adopted from the People's Organization of Community Acupuncture. This means that acupuncture is administered in a group setting, allowing the practitioners to work on more people and to make treatments very affordable. Treatments are provided on a sliding scale, increasing accessibility even more. Initial health intakes are done in private to protect confidentiality, but treatments are done mostly in the clinic's group treatment room, which contains eight recliners. Another room contains a massage table, where Wong and Lebow-Wolf can administer therapies such as cupping, or access a patient's back for acupuncture. Wong explained that most back problems can be addressed with acupuncture to the arms and legs, making the recliners a viable option for most treatments. She also said that acupuncture was recently recommended by the American College of Physicians as a first line treatment for back pain. Wong and Lebow-Wolf moved to Ann Arbor in 2014, returning to the state of Lebow-Wolf's childhood. The couple met in acupuncture school at Bastyr University in Seattle, Washington. Both practiced acupuncture in other locations prior to relocating. By converting to a nonprofit model, Wong and Lebow-Wolf hope to ensure that the clinic will always be a resource for the community. They are committed to keeping acupuncture accessible and the clinic sustainable. Three Detroit-based community acupuncture clinics have closed in the last three years, said Wong, and she and her husband are working to ensure this does not happen to their clinic. AACA holds quarterly open houses with free treatments for those interested in learning about acupuncture. The clinic, which gave over five thousand acupuncture treatments last year, is open five days per week. Dr. Wong is also a naturopathic doctor who offers nutrition and naturopathic treatments separately from the acupuncture clinic. Dr. Cheryl Wong and Evan Lebow-Wolf can be reached at (734) 780-7253 or info@annarborcommunityacupuncture.com. Their website is www.annarborcommunityacupuncture.com. The Ann Arbor Community Acupuncture clinic is located at 2500 Packard Street, Suite 100, Ann Arbor, MI 48104. Community Acupuncture Wong explained that most back problems can be addressed with acupuncture to the arms and legs. She also said that acupuncture was recently recommended by the American College of Physicians as a first line treatment for back pain. Upcoming Events Merri Walters and Robin Grosshuesch, married co-creators of Great Lakes Sacred Essences, will offer their first retreat on Mother's Day weekend, May 12 through 14. \"My purpose is to bring people to Lake Michigan to connect them with the sacred geography of the whole area,\" said Walters. As a holistic healer, she has been making flower essences for over 30 years and said, at 52, she is \"ready to transfer power to new generations and new people.\" The retreat is just a start, but Walters explained that she will also begin offering a mentorship program in the fall. The retreat will address her desire to teach, as well as meet the wishes of people across the country who have Merri Walters and Robin Grosshuesch The May retreat, titled \"Spirit of the Great Waters,\" will take place on the edge of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Activities will include studying the local plants and elemental presences, learning about flower essences for personal healing, meditation on the water, nature walks, and a land healing in the park. Merri Walters Continued from page 21The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 22 expressed interest in learning from her. She is still putting the program together, and said that it will likely consist of an online component along with a retreat for hands-on work. She will also be teaching in-person standalone classes locally. The May retreat, titled \"Spirit of the Great Waters,\" will take place on the edge of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. The location is important. \"We live in this great energetic basin,\" surrounded by a huge amount of the earth's fresh water, she said. Knowing how this influences us can help us know \"how we can stand stronger and make our prayers stronger and our intentions stronger.\" Participants will stay in houses from a turn-of-the-19 th-century logging town, now used as summer cottage rentals. The town is right next to Sleeping Bear Dunes National Park, where some teachings will take place. On the other side of the town is a nature conservancy. Activities will include studying the local plants and elemental presences, learning about flower essences for personal healing, meditation on the water, nature walks, and a land healing in the park. Walters said that when teaching to a group she leaves some flexibility in order to channel the right knowledge for the people in front of her. The retreat will start on Friday morning and end on Sunday afternoon. Food will be provided. To anyone considering the retreat or learning more about her healing work, Walters said \"this is a really important time we're living in. We need to stop just sitting around and meditating, and start doing things for the earth, and healing our broken relationship with nature which supports everything we are and do.\" More information about Great Lakes Sacred Essences, including online registration for the Spirit of the Great Waters Retreat, is at www.sacredessences.com.

The Interfaith Round Table of Washtenaw County will offer an interfaith music event on Sunday, May 21 at 4:00 p.m. at Genesis, the building shared by Temple Beth Emeth and St. Clare of Assisi Episcopal Church on Packard Road in Ann Arbor. The event is titled \"Voices of Children: Many Faiths, One Song\" and will feature four area children's choirs: the Hindu Chinmaya Mission, Temple Beth Emeth (a Reform Jewish congregation), St. Clare's Episcopal Church, and the First Unitarian Universalist Congregation. The Interfaith Round Table has operated in the community for the last 22 years. Its mission is to \"help create a culture of understanding and inclusion,\" said co-director George Lambrides. He explained that the organization is focused on religious inclusion, which he sees as a unique need since there are many organizations devoted to other types of inclusion around gender, race, sexual orientation, and other differences. In general, he said, \"the Buddhists don't know the Baptists, the Jews don't know the Hindus,\" and so on. Even in our current climate of unease and increased discrimination, particularly against Muslim and Jewish people, people are willing and able to spontaneously step up and give aid, Lambrides said. The recent fire at the Pittsfield Township mosque and Islamic school is a good example; within hours, community members donated more than the stated goal of $20,000 to the repair efforts. This is what he describes as an \"emergency room\" situation, whereas the Interfaith Round Table is more of a long-term \"rehab unit,\" providing opportunities for people of different faiths to get to know and support one another all of the time. The Round Table offers a changing variety of programs to support its mission, the most recent being its \"Places of Faith\" and \"Faces of Faith\" events. In Places of Faith, the Round Table invites members of the public to visit four different religious spaces for two hours on four consecutive Tuesday evenings. This gives people the opportunity to get to know people of a different religion, to visit them in their sacred space, experience their hospitality, and gain new understanding. Faces of Faith is a yearly event in which approximately six different religious leaders are invited to speak briefly on questions like \"what brings you joy about your religion,\" and \"what do you never want to hear again about your religion?\" Then, small groups converse and get to know more about the religions represented. The children's choir concert will be the first such event sponsored by the Round Table. The choirs will sing separately and together. Lambrides said he hopes to see between 200 and 300 people attending, and said it will be a fun and beautiful way to show support for diversity and inclusion. The concert is free, but there will be an opportunity to donate to the work of the Round Table. More information is available at www.irtwc.org. George Lambrides can be reached at gbrides@umich.edu or (734) 424-1535. Ypsilanti Reiki practitioner and teacher Andrew Anders will host Kathleen Prasad for a Reiki III and Animal Reiki teacher training course from May 5 through 7, at the Devoted Barn in Newport, Michigan. Kathleen Prasad is a Reiki practitioner, teacher, author, and Animal Reiki specialist. The course will consist of three full days, each made up of half lecture and half hands-on work with the animals of Devoted Barn, which include dogs, horses, barn cats, and pigs. Based in California, Kathleen Prasad is the founder of the Shelter Animal Reiki Association, an international nonprofit organization that works with caregivers, veterinarians and their staff, and volunteers to \"teach and promote Animal Reiki through mindful meditation practices.\" According to Prasad's website, \"Animal Reiki is a spiritual practice of compassion for all beings. In a nutshell, it means learning to meditate with your animals.\" Andrew Anders, founder of Michigan Reiki, explained that Animal Reiki uses a slightly different approach than human Reiki, as animals can't verbalize consent or explain what hurts. He explained that when Prasad works with a group of animals, she starts by sitting and \"emanating\" energy, which the animals react to in their own way. In addition to helping with issues of aggression, trust, eating and digestion, Reiki can simply provide animals with a sense of \"ease,\" which they often reflect back to the practitioner, making it somewhat of a \"trade effect.\" Animal Reiki can be especially helpful when practiced in shelters and rescues, like the Devoted Barn, where the animals are often in poor health and may have trouble trusting humans. The class is for Level II practitioners who want to learn how to teach Reiki and Animal Reiki, and for Level III practitioners and teachers who want to go more in-depth in their Animal Reiki skills and teaching. It will include initiation as a Reiki Master and Dr. Samm Pryce Ellen Porter Interfaith Round Table In the \"Places of Faith\" program, the Round Table invites members of the public to visit four different religious spaces for two hours.

Prasad and Anders both emphasize traditional Japanese techniques in their teaching and practices. As the founder of Michigan Reiki, Anders said his goals are to promote credible and practical standards of Reiki practice and to serve as a reliable resource for the health and wellness community of Michigan. He hopes this event will serve not only to teach practitioners, but also to \"establish credible Animal Reiki practices, representations, and resources in the Midwest.\" Andrew Anders can be reached by email at aanders@michiganreiki.org.

Dixie Highway, Newport, MI 48166. Energy healer and coach Tammy Braswell is now offering workshops in various topics related to expanding energetic awareness and consciousness. In the fall of 2016 she taught a continuing education course at the Wayne County Community College downriver campus called \"Understanding Your Energy for Health and Happiness.\" This inspired her to start offering more classes, in particular classes for women over 40, many of whom, she said, \"have been living their lives for everyone else first.\" Workshops are offered in a brand new classroom on the lower level of Braswell's private residence in downtown Wayne. The address and directions are sent upon registration. The classes are limited to 11 people to keep an intimate atmosphere with individual interaction. Workshops are held on Saturdays and weekdays at varying times to fit as many schedules as possible, and last from 90 minutes to 3 hours depending on the topic. Braswell records each session so that participants can go back and re-examine them at any time. She does encourage people to bring a notebook for journaling. Topics include \"Healing the Child You \u2014 Freeing Yourself from Past Pain, Hurt, and Fear\"; \"Loving Yourself for Who You Are \u2014 Love Your Body into Wholeness Through Your Connection and Word\"; \"Breaking the Chains that Bind You \u2014 Healing Emotional Wounds and Finding Freedom in Forgiveness\"; and \"Pre-Paving Your Tomorrow \u2014 Designing Your Future the Way You Want It To Be.\" Over 12 different topics are currently offered, and more will be added as Braswell creates them. Each workshop is designed to raise vibrations and empower participants to improve their ability to manifest their desires.

Lisa Gottlieb, MSW, SSW, is a Certified Trainer Candidate in Nonviolent Communication, set to complete her certification through the Center for Nonviolent Communication in June. She has been a social worker for over 20 years, and became interested in Nonviolent Communication in 2014. Finding a lack of practice groups and workshops in the Ann Arbor area, she made it her goal to form a local community around the practice of Nonviolent Communication (NVC).

The international nonprofit foundation he began \u2014 the Center for Nonviolent Communication \u2014 states \"NVC can be seen as both a spiritual practice that helps us see our common humanity, using our power in a way that honors everyone's needs, and a concrete set of skills which help us create life-serving families and communities.\" On June 2 and 3 at the Zion Lutheran Church in Ann Arbor, Gottlieb, along with NVC-Certified Trainers Jeff Brown (Columbus) and Francois Beausoleil (Quebec), will offer a day-and-a-half long workshop titled \"Speaking and Listening from the Heart: Introduction to Nonviolent Compassionate Communication.\" This standalone workshop can also serve as an introduction for those looking to enter Gottlieb's intensive nine-month NVC program consisting of four weekend workshops, teleconferences, coaching, and more.

Robin Robinson, owner and teacher at Robinsongs for Kids, is offering a new intergenerational class for young children and seniors, called Generations. Robinsongs is a music teaching program for kids, using the Music Together approach. Music Together is an international organization that trains music teachers to offer music programs for children ages five and under and their parents. Robinson has offered Music Together classes in Ann Arbor and Chelsea since 2008, when she moved back to Ann Arbor from New York City. She spent 22 years in New York as a performer after studying musical theater at the University of Michigan. Singing and playing music from a very young age helps children prepare for musical training as they get older, but it also brings families closer. Robinson explained, \"We are bringing back something essential that has been lost \u2014 intergenerational music-making.\" With the Generations class, which she began offering in the fall, families are able to interact with an additional generation \u2014 one which is too often not attended to in the busy-ness of young families working and raising children. Robinson calls the seniors \"grandfriends,\" as they are usually not relatives of the children but play a similar role to grandparents when they interact. \"This is not a performance that the seniors watch; they sing, move, and play instruments right along with us,\" she said. The children interact with the seniors in many ways that benefit both groups. Children will be given the task of handing out instruments to the seniors, who praise them and allow them to see \"how wonderful it feels to give.\" Robinson said she is constantly amazed by how even the most withdrawn seniors \"perk up\" and sing the songs they know from their own childhoods. The Generations class is offered at the Chelsea Retirement Community. About 15 seniors participate with the families who come in. Robinson said that the class is being offered in fall, winter, spring, with the possibility of summer sessions being added. More information is available on Robin Robinson's website, www.robinsongsforkids. com. She can be reached by phone at (734) 929-2133 or by email at director@robinsongsforkids.com. Paulette Grotrian will offer an 8-week course beginning in September on Mindful Self-Compassion. Grotrian is a Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) teacher, and a founding member of the Ann Arbor Center for Mindfulness. The Mindful Self-Compassion course was developed in 2013 by Kristen Neff and Christopher Germer at the University of California at San Diego Medical School. In 2015 they developed teacher training for those who wanted to teach the course. Grotrian completed teacher training with Neff and Germer in 2016, and this will be her second time teaching the course in this area \u2014 the pilot course was required for completion of her training. She became interested in MSC when she became aware, in teaching MBSR, that people were struggling with the compassion component of mindfulness \u2014 specifically compassion for the self. She read Neff and Germer's books: The Mindful Path to Self-Compassion: Freeing Yourself from Destructive Thoughts and Emotions by Germer, and Self-Compassion: The Proven Power of Being Kind to Yourself by Neff. When Grotrian discovered that Neff and Germer had developed a teacher training program, she decided to pursue it. She traveled to California, where Neff and Germer personally trained a group of about 30 people. Currently, said Grotrian, there are about 300 teachers who have completed this training in the United States. The MSC course consists of eight two-hour weekly classes and a half-day retreat. It includes guided meditations and teaches coping skills related to mindfulness and self-kindness, self-soothing, and emotional resilience. It will be held at the Center for Innovation and Education (formerly St. Joseph Hospital) in Saline. More information is at www.mindfulnesswithpaulette.weebly.com.

Bridging US 23 is a new initiative jointly sponsored by the Association for Youth Empowerment and the Dispute Resolution Center. It is modeled after a successful Detroit initiative: Bridging 8 Mile, which aims to bring different communities together to get to know each other and find common ground. Detroit is hugely divided by race and socioeconomic status. David Abramson, one of the creators of the Bridge programs, explained that when people don't know how to interact with one another, it's easy not to care about the problems the other group faces. When people begin to communicate in depth, compassion and action are born. Bridging US 23 Abramson feels that a great divide exists between Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti and the surrounding communities. He said that US 23, in addition to being a physical boundary between Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti, is a metaphor for the things that divide us: race, religion, political affiliation, socioeconomic status, and so on. David Abramson and Belinda DulinContinued from page 25The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 26 Abramson feels that a great divide exists between Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti and the surrounding communities. He said that US 23, in addition to being a physical boundary between Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti, is a metaphor for the things that divide us: race, religion, political affiliation, socioeconomic status, and so on. Belinda Dulin, Executive Director of the Dispute Resolution Center (DRC), said that a recent equity report found that life expectancy is lower by 10 years in Ypsilanti than in Ann Arbor. This is just one symptom of the separation of our communities that concerns her. The initiative's first public event is being held on April 7 at Washtenaw Community College for the entire day, with more events to be scheduled. Abramson said he hopes the event will draw people who work in local nonprofit agencies, as well as people who receive the services of those agencies, and members of the general public. The goal is to bring people together and find commonalities, he said. Facilitators will ask questions, make people laugh, and enable people to share more than they normally would, turning strangers into friends and allies. Dulin said it is important to come into this process without a list of assumed problems and solutions, and to first listen to people talk about what problems they actually experience and what they need. Sometimes, she said, \"all that's needed is a connection or someone who's interested.\" Much of the time, conflict arises when people do not feel heard, she said. Robert Cooper, President of the Association for Youth Empowerment (AYE) spoke of \"calling forth the beloved community,\" an expression used by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The event will also incorporate aspects of Nonviolent Communication and peacemaking. Abramson said that what comes of Bridging US 23 will ultimately be decided by the people who get involved, but he predicts that some of the program's effects may include expanded support for existing literacy, tutoring, and mentoring programs; networking, fellowship, and community nights; cross-cultural dialogue events; music and art festivals and events; ethnic pot luck dinners; entrepreneur round tables and resource sharing; and anything else people come up with that would be of value to people in the communities. He continued: We believe that there's no distance too far that can't be bridged. And the basic premise is that to the extent that we know each other, we can trust each other. To the extent that we trust each other, we can team together. To the extent that we team together we can make a difference. And that's what we're committed to: making that difference; of a world where people are treated with dignity, respect, justice and honor. We regret to report that David Abramson died unexpectedly on March 23. This interview was conducted prior to his passing. The Bridging US 23 project will move forward, and, at the time of publishing, the April 7 event at Washtenaw Community College will still happen.

Through the Institute, he focuses on helping professional and amateur musicians \"create healthy music practices leading to a lifetime of music making.\" As a professional church musician, Meyer-Kukan sings, and plays piano, organ, handbells, and percussion. Several years ago, he injured his shoulder, resulting in neuropathy in his hand that impeded his piano and organ playing. His doctor sent him to a specialist who recommended physical therapy. It helped somewhat, but he still had trouble playing. Seeking alternative treatments, he met Alice Greminger, a local music teacher and practitioner of the Alexander Technique \u2014 a system designed by F. M. Alexander for reducing harmful bodily tension in daily activities through body awareness and mindfulness. Meyer-Kukan found that the technique helped him return to his full abilities. He also developed an interest in anatomy, and at Greminger's suggestion, enrolled in the now closed Ann Arbor Institute of Massage Therapy (AAIMT). He said AAIMT gave him a thorough education in anatomy, and he became a licensed massage therapist. Meyer-Kukan now helps other musicians get and stay healthy through massage, which can help with repetitive strain issues, and through teaching what he calls \"healthy musician practices.\" He has helped a violinist who was no longer able to lift her arm high enough to play; pianists who have had to stop playing due to a breakdown in dexterity; and musicians who complained they were no longer able to play as they had before. His teaching incorporates aspects of the Alexander Technique and Body Mapping; anatomy education; posture correction; and examination of the musician's approach to his or her instrument and what is required of his or her body to play. He offers one-on-one instruction as well as classes and workshops. Meyer-Kukan also offers massage for non-musicians, including the Raindrop Technique, which incorporates aromatherapy with essential oils into the massage. In addition to massage therapy, he offers individual music lessons and lessons in healthy musician practices out of his home studio in Southeast Ann Arbor near Packard and Platt Roads. Rob Meyer-Kukan can be reached by email at info@healthymusicianinstitute.com or phone at (248) 962-5475.

Carla Samson, along with her fianc\u00e9 Scott Van Sice, opened Align Divine Yoga on Liberty Street in downtown Ann Arbor in December of 2016. The studio offers a mix of classes, workshops, and events combining \"yogic, shamanic and mystery traditions,\" explained Samson. During the last several years, Samson has traveled extensively throughout India, South and Central America, and Australia, learning about these traditions. She and Van Sice are former circus performers who used fire dancing and acrobatics in their shows. Samson said they both \"love creative movement and playfulness,\" and the studio's culture reflects this. She explained that her vision includes \"building a tribe or community, and moving toward the authentic divine,\" through \"diving deeper into human connection\" and \"finding new ways to enhance our health, wellness, self-care, creativity, and playfulness.\" Samson is a certified yoga instructor, holds a B.S. in Exercise Physiology and Holistic Health, and is now pursuing a master's degree in Spiritual Nutrition in preparation to become a nutrition counselor. Together she and the other instructors at the studio offer a variety of classes. These include, among others, \"Alchemy Vinyasa\" \u2014 a yoga flow incorporating shamanic techniques; \"Tantric Vinyasa\" \u2014 which combines traditional hatha yoga techniques with visualization, sacred sound, and other techniques focused on \"lighting the soul's inherent flame\"; and \"SoundBath Meditation\" \u2014 a sound mediation with quartz crystal song bowls. Align Divine also offers a weekly Ecstatic Dance class called Dance Tribe Fridays. Samson described this as \"a transformational experience, exploring freeform, creative conscious movement\" in a \"safe and sacred space.\" Monthly, the studio holds a Cacao Ceremony. Cacao is the raw form of chocolate. Its Latin name is 'cacao Theobroma,' which means \"the food of the gods.\" Samson explained that the cacao she uses is from Guatemala where it is traditionally grown and blessed. She mixes it into a sort-of \"hot chocolate,\" sweetening its bitter taste with superfoods like maple syrup. It is then used in a ritual to \"set intentions\" and \"lift our spirits, dance our hearts, and connect with our divine purpose on this planet.\" Align Divine Yoga is located at 201 East Liberty Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48103.

The firm deadline for submissions for the next issue (September through December 2017) is July 1, 2017.Grace Helms Kotre started her business, Power to Be, LLC, in mid-2016. She offers mindfulness instruction for children and families. Her background includes a bachelor's degree in child development from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a master's degree in social work from the University of Michigan. She began practicing mindfulness meditation in 2009 and received over a year of in-depth meditation training with Carol Blotter of Chelsea Meditation. She then completed a year-long Mindfulness Instructor certification program through Mindful Schools, a California-based organization which offers education programs for educators who want to teach mindfulness practices to children. She is a member of the Michigan Collaborative for Mindfulness in Education and has additional training in mindful parenting, nonviolent communication, intergroup dialogue, and racial justice. Helms Kotre has intentionally started her business slowly, as she has been staying home with her two young daughters, but found that it has taken off more quickly than she had planned. She started by volunteering her services at Peace Neighborhood Center in Ann Arbor and at her daughters' preschool. She then began offering classes through Ann Arbor Rec & Ed and in local schools and youth organizations. She also offers individual lessons for children and their parents, so that lessons can be reinforced and practiced at home. Helms Kotre explained that mindfulness benefits children by helping with stress, increasing capacity to pay attention at school and at home, and developing emotional self-regulation. She said that parents have reported their kids using their mindful breathing or emotional mindfulness to calm themselves down at home, and even explaining to the parents in stressful situations how they can calm themselves. Though she does work with some children with diagnoses, such as ADHD, she said the practices can help anyone. She simplifies the practices so children can understand and uses games and activities to reinforce the ideas. She always encourages the kids to practice at home and school, then share what they did at the next lesson. She explained that whether in a classroom or individual setting she prefers to do repeated lessons, so that the children and their families can really incorporate the mindfulness practices into their lives. She said that she works most with children ages three to five, though she does work with elementary, middle, and some high schoolers as well. She emphasized that even very young kids can grasp and use the skills. Grace Helms Kotre can be reached at gracekotre@mindfulpowertobe.com or (734) 255-0090.

It's a really exciting time in an industry that is still relatively new, and the awakening is amazing. Our patients bring stories back to us that affirm that what we're doing here is worthwhile, that the stress and the struggles are worthwhile, and it's an amazingly rewarding feeling for all of us.\" Dori is originally from Jackson, Michigan, but moved out West at about the age of 19 to explore what the world outside of Michigan held for her. She spent most of her time in Northern California and the mountains of Colorado. While in California, she learned about living and eating healthier. \"California is more advanced than Michigan when it comes to healthy food; even in the 90s they had juice bars everywhere and people were interested in knowing the ingredients in their food,\" she said. \"They weren't worried about the fat content, but wanted to know what the actual ingredients were.\" Dori realized that by eating a healthier diet and exercising regularly, her body responded in positive ways. She returned to Michigan in 1997, attended the Rudolf Steiner Teaching Institute, married, and began a family. Dori chose this path because Steiner's system values natural means to optimize and maintain physical and mental health and wellbeing. These were things she fully believed in and had already put to practice in her own life. After having her daughter, Dori taught in a Waldorf school for five years and The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 32 This is one of a series of articles we've been doing on local business owners and their relatively newer businesses. As the economy in Michigan has struggled over many years, there are still brave souls who have taken the leap of faith to open their own businesses here. What follows are personal profiles of two businesses that are thriving despite the odds. By Mary Stokley Photos by Susan Ayer In August 2015, Dori Edwards opened Bloom City Cannabis Club, her second dispensary venture, alongside her business partner, Allison Ireton. Both women came to Bloom via circuitous routes but ended up right here, where they're needed, and during an exciting time in the medical cannabis industry. With Allison managing the retail side of the business and Dori applying her skills to the growing side (she's affectionately known as 'Gangamama'), the two have turned what was once an old service garage into a thriving business committed to quality and customer service. The knowledgeable staff at Bloom City Club works together to provide the \"highest grade, pesticide free, craft/small batch, natural (organic) cannabis,\" grown only by selected providers who subscribe to the Blue Bud standard of growing. Any products sold in the dispensary are from \"like-minded vendors whose ideals reflect our values of serving people,\" according to Bloom's website. You'll feel welcome in the 5-star rated customer service environment designed with patients and people in mind. The staff understands cannabis laws can be confusing, so they've made Bloom a place where anyone can feel comfortable having questions answered. Bloom is not just a dispensary \u2014 it is also a place to be educated about the use and many medicinal purposes of cannabis. Dori, Allison, and their staff hold cannabis classes, covering subjects such as Cannabis & Pets, Concentrates, How to Make Your Own Bloom City Club \u2014 Downtown's Blooms, Buds, and Flowers Bloom City Club 423 Miller Ave., Ann Arbor, Michigan 48103(734) 585-0621www.bloomcityclub.comconnect@bloomcityclub.com\"It's a really exciting time in an industry that is still relatively new, and the awakening is amazing.

She and her husband started Like Water Drum and Dance Troupe and danced all over Michigan in different festivals. She even stopped teaching because the drum and dance troupe did so well. In 2008, when funding was pulled from the Arts and Humanities Council, the troupe lost all its contracts, and Dori and her husband decided to sell. Shortly thereafter, the pair separated, and her husband moved to Boston. Now a single mother during the time when Michigan first became legal for medical marijuana, Dori decided to open Treecity Health Collective, a medical marijuana dispensary, in 2010. Because she had never taken any pharmaceuticals or antibiotics and had been passionate about natural medicine, she decided it was time \"to put my philosophies behind my business and livelihood. I've also only ever immunized my children when we went to West Africa, and only the things that they absolutely needed. I feel it was an educated decision, not just a philosophical one. I've raised my kids with anthroposophical medicine because I'm very strong-minded about being able to make our own educated choices about what is important for our bodies and how we want to heal ourselves.\" Dori expressed her frustration with the medical establishment and how she feels we aren't taught about real health, but simply provided with band-aid solutions. \"So, when Michigan legalized medical marijuana, I took it upon myself to advocate for our civil right to have a choice for our own bodies,\" Dori said. Unfortunately, the timing was off, and she ended up selling the dispensary in 2013. At the time, she felt she would never return to the industry, but that changed when she met her business partner Allison a few years later.

After graduating college, she worked in Human Resources for Perdue Farms in Salisbury, Maryland. She then married and moved to Maine and worked as a technical writer in software for Paychex. When Allison was in her 30s, Paychex was bought out by another company, and her job was going to move to Rochester, New York. \"I didn't really like what I was doing well enough to move to New York, so I decided to go to law school instead. My mother always said that I was an argumentative child who liked to justify and rationalize things and that I should go to law school and make it official,\" she laughed. \"So, I did. I received a full ride scholarship to Ave Maria Law School and moved to Michigan in 2003.\" After graduating in 2006, she took a job with a law firm in downtown Detroit and learned that, oftentimes, laws are written without any practical understanding of how they will actually work in the real world and then need to be tweaked and fine-tuned. \"It's a way of getting a ball rolling on a given matter and then improving the law as it begins to be applied,\" Allison said. Eventually, Allison left her position to open her own practice in Ann Arbor. To market her practice, she got involved with Business Networking International (BNI), where she met Dori Edwards. She provided legal assistance and friendly support to Dori while she went through a divorce. \"I didn't know as much about cannabis as Dori did,\" Allison explained. \"All I knew was the criminal penalty for possession. I also knew that so many more bad things happen from alcohol and heroin abuse than from marijuana use.\" She was interested in doing something to change the laws and attitudes surrounding marijuana, especially in relation to its health benefits, so she and Dori collaborated to open Bloom City Club. Dori manages the growing side of the business, tending to the strains and ensuring they're raised 100 percent organically, while Allison manages the retail side of the business. They have also partnered with a business/sales coach who drives world-class customer service as a priority focus. Although a few men have joined the staff, Bloom is primarily operated by women. \"The women rock Bloom,\" Dori said. Their patients often come to Bloom in extreme amounts of pain and discomfort, so providing the best customer service and sharing the knowledge they have is of paramount importance. ### The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 34 Feature continued from page 33 The idea behind \"Leaps of Faith,\" as the title suggests, is to celebrate individuals who have taken a leap of faith in their lives by foregoing more mainstream employment avenues to dive into the one thing they are truly and absolutely passionate about. Sensei Thomas Wright certainly exemplifies this concept. Sensei Wright, who goes by Tom, opened Wright's Karate and Fitness in 2002. The studio began small, focusing solely on Tom's first love, teaching karate. Now, the studio has expanded both in size and offerings. In addition to karate classes, workshops, and private lessons, Tom also offers personal training, training for two or more, boot camps, self-defense seminars, corporate self-defense seminars, workshops and hands-on clinics, mixed martial arts (MMA) core training, and all around fun with fitness training. When the dojo first opened (dojo simply means room or hall where martial arts are practiced), it occupied a small but sufficient portion of the building where it's currently located, near Lillie Park in Pittsfield Township. Tom taught the art and history of Isshinryu karate to kids and students of all ages. \"I didn't begin training in karate until I was 22 years old,\" he explained. \"So, I know you can learn it at any age.\" Isshinryu karate focuses on \"One Heart Mind,\" Tom explained, which means body and mind working in tandem. \"My goal in training is to take students who are right handed, with the majority of strength and coordination [being] on their right side, and make them equally strong and coordinated on their left side, bringing them into balance, and making both mind and body strong.\" Tom has been in love with the practice and discipline of Isshinryu karate since the first day he began training. In 1982, he earned his first-degree black belt and began teaching other students under the tutelage of his Sensei (teacher). Tom currently holds an eighth-degree black belt and has instructed hundreds of students in the traditions, or Katas, and weaponry of Isshinryu over the last 35 years. Wright's Karate and Fitness \u2014 Fitness and Fun for All Wright's Karate and Fitness 4597 Platt Rd. Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104 (734) 678-1090 www.wrightskarate21.cominfo@wrightsfitness.com Sensei Tom Wright\"My goal in training is to take students who are right handed, with the majority of strength and coordination [being] on their right side, and make them equally strong and coordinated on their left side, bringing them into balance, and making both mind and body strong.\" - Sensei Thomas Wright Karate is not just about fighting, and Sensei Wright makes sure his students understand that one should engage in fighting only as a last resort, when all other options have been exhausted.According to Tom, more and more companies are willing to pay for their employees to exercise through corporate self-defense training and seminars or corporate fitness training programs, both of which he now offers either in the dojo or at a remote location. Self-defense training and seminars are good for all employees, but martial arts fitness programs can reap positive benefits for female employees especially, including a stronger sense of security, plus the strength and knowledge to diffuse potentially dangerous and threatening situations and the ability to protect themselves when a situation cannot be diffused. Going to the gym is a great way of getting exercise and helping your body to become a strong, well-oiled machine that moves with ease as it was intended to do, but doing the same thing every day can become monotonous, and, in addition, the body might reach a plateau with repetitive workouts. The diversity of classes at Wright's Karate and Fitness, and the mental and character-building components of a deep mind and body practice like Isshinryu karate, will continually engage you and your body in your exercise practice. \"Make me your co-pay, not your doctor,\" Tom likes to tell potential clients. He believes he can help his clients reach and exceed their personal goals, as well as decrease their need to visit the doctor. ###But karate is not just about fighting, and Sensei Wright makes sure his students understand that one should engage in fighting only as a last resort, when all other options have been exhausted. Other attributes students (and parents) should seek within the practice of Isshinryu karate, or any other martial art, include self-confidence, good citizenship, flexibility, physical strengthening, mental agility, and an increased sense of respect for self and others. While he's not a drill sergeant, Tom does command respect inside the dojo and fully expects his students to practice that same respect at home, as well as in their schools and communities. One of Tom's favorite karate precepts is, \"strike when the opportunity presents itself.\" \"It's good advice not only in karate, but in making good business, life, and personal decisions as well. It's advice I encourage my students to follow wholeheartedly,\" he said. In 2012, after 22 years of employment with Conway Freight Company, Tom seized the opportunity to step away from the freight business to focus full time on his dojo. He expanded the space and branched out into fitness training and other classes besides karate. He loves to teach karate but wanted to make sure his days were full. For him, it also \"took some time to really grasp the idea that people were willing to pay me to keep them in shape,\" he said. This sentiment comes from the heart of a man who truly loves what he does. Karate, training, and physical activity have been a part of Tom's life for so many years that they've become ingrained in his being. And, according to the testimonials of his clients, he is very good at it. According to Jon Kroll, a software engineer and student of Tom's, \"Tom has always made me feel like my fitness, my self-improvement was a personal mission of his... that is his excellence as a teacher.\" Tom also told me about an elderly couple who train with him regularly. The man told Tom that he decided he needed his help because he wanted to be \"living to die rather than just waiting to die.\" That's a pretty accurate assessment of the difference regular exercise can have on the body and mind of an individual. Exercise keeps your body moving more easily and gives you a good feeling about yourself and your overall condition, thanks to the endorphins that are released. So, it's easy to see how that change in mindset can be attained. Businesses and corporations are starting to see the value in exercise for their employees and some are even beginning to pay for their employees to participate in programs like Tom's corporate self-defense seminar. In a pamphlet he gave to me about the self-defense seminar, I read that \"for every $1 invested in health promotion, small businesses can save between $3 and $5 in health and safety costs, including medical expenses, absenteeism, and workplace accidents,\" according to the Small Business Wellness Initiative, a community collaborative project funded by the Department of Health and Human Services. The same Small Business Wellness Initiative also reported that other benefits small businesses could expect from healthier employees are increased productivity, enhanced social behavior, fewer sick days, better team players, and higher morale. Healthy employees help motivate the people around them, which can all help to reduce insurance premiums.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 35 Spiritual healings with Eve give strength and courage to succeed and be whole on every level.

Namaste, Katie... A good place to start with adding some extra length to the quadriceps is through a Low Lunge Pose, or Anjaneyasana. The added benefit of starting with Low Lunge is that it is a progressive posture that can be deepened as the muscles become more supple. One of the best resources for relaxing through the face and jaw is to allow space into the neck and release tension there. Once we know how to perform an asana safely , we should try to let go of what those around us are doing, and find the expression of the posture that suits our needs on that day . Photography by Hilary Nichols Namaste, Katie \u2014 I am getting back into gardening this spring and have noticed that after this long winter my quads are quite tight. I am struggling with crouching down to the flower beds, and this hasn't been an issue for me in the past. Though I've been going to yoga, I haven't found quite the right posture in my regular class. Any tips? Dan G., Ann ArborHi Dan,With quadriceps being one of the strongest muscle groups in the body, getting an adequate stretch for them in your usual yoga class may prove difficult, especially if you regularly strengthen and tone these muscles through your day-to-day activities. A good place to start with adding some extra length to the quadriceps is through a Low Lunge Pose, or Anjaneyasana. The added benefit of starting with Low Lunge is that it is a progressive posture that can be deepened as the muscles become suppler. To come into Low Lunge, start in Table Posture, then bring the right foot forward in between the hands, close to the right hand. Feel free to use blocks under the hands if it feels more comfortable. The left leg will be the focus of the release here. If the left leg (currently at a 90-degree angle) is feeling a release, allow yourself to stay here and breathe. If and when it feels right, you can inch the leg back, opening up release points not only in the quads, but in the hip flexors as well. As you are sliding your leg back, be sure you aren't resting your weight on the kneecap, but rather on either the tibia or the femur. Over time (and this can be years for some of us!) you may wish to raise the lower leg, and take the ankle with the right hand, adding to the opportunity for release (see photo below). If you are there now, feel free to give it a try. When you feel ready, move to the other side. Namaste, Katie \u2014During meetings, I have been routinely noticing that I am clenching my jaw and face. I have enjoyed the breathing exercises you have written about in past issues, but I find that once this tension has already settled in my body, I need something a bit more than the breath to release it. It would be nice to have a few postures I could do in my cubicle to release that held tension. Lisa S., Chelsea Dear Lisa, I hear you on this one! Breath exercises are fantastic releases and work in conjunction with so much of our asana work. That said, there are certainly times when we don't have the space or quiet to focus on the breath exclusively, and, as a result, we aren't able to let go of tension with the breath alone. One of the best resources for relaxing through the face and jaw is to allow space into the neck and release tension there. At Sun Moon Yoga (which is now closed), we called this particular release \"Ear to the Stars,\" though I am certain other yogis have different names for this particular sequence. Here is how it goes: On an inhale lengthen through the neck and allow the right ear to float up toward the sky. Here, it is important to keep our attention on lifting through the right ear, not on how far the left ear is moving down toward the left shoulder. This allows the scalene muscles (muscles along the side of the neck) to become long. When ready, move to the other side (see photo above). Next, on an inhale, lift through the crown of the head, lengthening through the neck, and allow the chin to make its way over toward the left shoulder. Some days, the chin may make it to hover over the left collar bone; other days, it may only make it half way. Breathe into this space, and perhaps, on the exhale, you'll find that the sternocleidomastoid opens up, or maybe not on this particular day. The sternocleidomastoid (a long muscle in the side of the neck that extends up from the thorax to the base of the skull behind the ear) is quite involved in holding tension in the neck area of the body. Once you have moved to the other side for a few breaths, you may want to try a flow from one side to the other: inhale to center; exhale and move the chin out toward one shoulder; inhale back to center; then exhale over the opposite shoulder. Be mindful to keep the shoulder blades relaxed, spine long. Namaste, Katie \u2014In my regular yoga class, some people use a strap in Seated Forward Fold, and others can hold onto their feet. I see some people not using any props and bending the legs, and others without props not touching the toes/feet. Help! I have no idea what to do! Ebony S., Ann ArborDear Ebony,Not to dodge your important question, but what do you want to do? You have tapped into one of the most beautiful aspects of the practice of yoga \u2014 it is your practice. First and foremost, you get to decide in each and every posture how it feels to you and what the posture will look like. An important element to practice each time we step on the mat is to do our very best to \"stay\" on our mat. Once we know how to perform an asana safely, we should try to let go of what those around us are doing, and find the expression of the posture that suits our needs on that day. Ebony, I am not saying this is easy \u2014 I still have to remind myself of this. For a more direct answer, there are a few variations you could try. Paschimottanasana, or Seated Forward Fold, has many opportunities for growth and exploration, as you mentioned in your question. In any yoga asana, we want to be mindful to not lock the joints, so wherever we are, we want to make sure we have softness in the knees. Perhaps start with legs long on the mat, length in the spine, and try walking the hands out. See where they end up. Perhaps they rest on the mat next to the legs, or on the thighs or shins. Noticing where you feel tension in the body is key to developing that opening and length in the body. Using props, as you mentioned, can be fantastic. One caution with using yoga straps is to make certain that we aren't yanking or tugging on the body. We simply use the strap as an extension of the arms. When we use straps, there is a strong temptation to want to force the opening to happen, rather than allowing the body to get there on its own. But, if you find that sweet spot of opening and length with the strap, please utilize the support. Katie Hoener is an RYT 500, receiving her 200 and 500 hour trainings.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 38 By Kirsten Mowrey I'm Kirsten Mowrey, the new columnist for Green Living. For many of us, \"green living\" is really a synonym for \"green shopping.\" How do I know what kind of light bulb to buy? How can I purchase less polluting foods, appliances, clothing, toys, cars, and phones? Paper or plastic? What businesses walk their environmental talk, and who is just green washing? Excellent questions all, but they arise from the framework of people as consumers, standing outside ecosystems and objectifying the planet. Part of my goal as the new columnist is to broaden the definition of green living. I want to explore being deep green, and propose we shift our orientation from separate to connected. Seeing ourselves as intrinsic to nature, living in reciprocity with our environment in ways attuned to that situation. Remember \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears?\" We are looking for \"just right\"; symmetry in our connections, place, rights, duties, giving, and receiving. Our Earth is unique in the universe. Our current paradigm, adopted in the early twentieth century, views any biological form not human as object, rationalizing the use and abuse of it. Even \"human \" has a very specific definition, separating skin colors, genders, and religions. In opposition, many religions hold that we are all connected and united. Recent decades of scientific data show collaborating and assisting strategies are preferred over competitive ones for meeting a species' needs. Mycelial networks connect trees in a forest, transporting nutrients where needed; herbivores graze particular plants to encourage birds that will eat their parasites. While I will focus on a local organization each issue, I will also reflect and suggest ways to experience this broader perspective. How can we, here amid the oak savannas of southeastern Michigan, plant ourselves in the wonders of our place in the Great Lakes? You can try exploring the beginnings of that paradigm shift now, in Buhr Park in Ann Arbor. If you enter off Packard Road and drive past Cobblestone Farm, past the ice arena, and continue up the curve of the gravel overflow parking lot, you will see a planting on the hill. Walk up the slight rise toward a wooden structure. Once you are in the circle, look around. You are standing in the middle of a food forest. A food forest is a concept from permaculture. Permaculture is the idea of \"permanent agriculture\" where there is continual food and bounty (permanent), with minimal human work and maintenance (agriculture). In many ways, it echoes the Potawatomi and Ojibway, living mostly off the local landscape with small cultivated areas, except that the entirety is planned and planted to create a deliberate forest. Rather than oak, maple, and beech, here you see peach, pear, cherry, and paw paw. Planted in \"guilds\" \u2014 a grouping of plants that work together \u2014 the forest takes time to establish but maintains itself over time. Guilds are created to mimic a native forest: understory and canopy plants, fast growers and slow, soil feeders, and fruit bearing. Buhr Park's food forest contains 25 fruit trees of the types mentioned, surrounded by 20 shrubs including currants, gooseberries, serviceberries, hazelnuts, and a raspberry patch. The creation of the forest is a story of giving \u2014 of generosity, sharing, and abundance over and over, expanding each time, to benefit the community. In 2010, the Ann Arbor Parks Department was redoing the sidewalk from Essex Road to Allen Elementary to make it American Disabilities Act compliant. In planning the excavation, they saw that the Wet Meadow Project had, as part of their zero runoff goal, proposed a third wet meadow in the area. AA Parks contacted them and asked if the Project wanted the area scooped out and offered to pay for the plants. Wet Meadow Project contact Jeannine Palms agreed. The sidewalk required a great deal of earth moving to construct correctly, and as a result, a large area south of the wet meadow boundary ended up with no grass. Palms asked the Department if they could have that area for a food forest, and they agreed. For the next year, the Wet Meadow Project did its best to hold off the grass while focusing on the newly planted third wet meadow. Three high school students developed a goal and plan for the forest area and Allen School Pride Team wrote a grant for the first fruit tree seedlings. In 2012, those plants were put in and tended through that summer and the next by Allen School and Green Camp students. Ann Arbor Learning Community and Summers-Knoll students have also assisted with maintenance, and Blossom Daycare and Forest School children visit the park all year. In February 2017, daycare children wove wreaths from pruned grapevines and decorated them with seed heads. Gift after gift after gift created the forest. Money was needed, yes, but what really mattered was human attention and time. All this, despite challenges: the schools that sent children have had curriculum changes so they no longer assist; Green Camp no longer exists; neighbors have taken tools; and last year the raccoons enjoyed all the peaches, picking them at perfect ripeness. Some children, not understanding where food comes from, pick unripe fruit to use as balls and discard when finished. In the future, Palms hopes for more community involvement. Yet, she says, \"With all this, our triumph is we've figured out ways to manage despite the challenges, and [I] see the fruits of it on lots of different levels.\" I'm writing this column in February, but you will be reading it in May, when the sun is out and we all burst outside after being captive indoors for months. Try wandering over to the food forest and see what's blooming. Maybe you will sit in the grape arbor and hear the birds looking for mates. Maybe you will pull a few weeds, or feel the soft soil underfoot while your kids dig in the dirt, or watch the wind blowing clouds high above. Maybe you will visit when there is fruit on the trees or some ready serviceberries to taste. Enjoyment of the food forest does not depend on money, position, or achievement. It invites: Will you step into relationship, join, and unite \u2014 let down the walls that separate and open to the abundance all around you?

The basic idea is to eliminate the concerning food from your diet, then reintroduce it to see if a reaction can be elicited. Although sometimes elimination is enough to clarify that a food was causing a problem, often a clear answer about a food's potential contribution to a health problem comes about only with reintroduction. Typically foods should be avoided for two to four weeks. When you reintroduce the food, I usually say \"reintroduce it with a passion,\" as long as anaphylaxis is not a concern. If you suspect that a food might cause swelling of your airway or respiratory distress, food reintroduction should not happen except in the presence of a health professional with the capacity to respond to anaphylaxis. Somewhere around the age of 12, I got a hold of some chocolate and conducted a reintroduction oral challenge. Fortunately, no anaphylaxis and no reaction. Either I had desensitized to chocolate with avoidance and time, or the original test gave false results. Children often outgrow their allergies. About a dozen foods frequently cause problems. These tend to be foods that we are regularly exposed to. At the top of the list are beef, dairy, and gluten. Soy, citrus, corn, peanuts, processed foods, and other animal foods are also common suspects. The question is not whether these foods are good or bad for us generally, but whether they are a problem for you in particular. The hard part of the test is not so much the elimination of foods; with a little coaching it's possible to manage for a few weeks without too much difficulty. After depriving yourself, reintroducing foods one at a time, allowing three days between each reintroduced food, is when it gets difficult. You may find yourself wanting to reintroduce everything at once. Reintroduction is the time when you get answers. If a symptom presents during the three days after starting a new food, that food may be a problem. When in doubt, you can conduct the experiment again. The point is to get information about how you respond to the foods you're testing. What you do with that information is a whole other issue, and a topic for another column.

Depending on a patient's needs he will: encourage lifestyle modification; provide emotional support; use mind-body therapies; engage energy healing; recommend herbs and nutritional supplements; and prescribe hormones and conventional medications.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 40 I learned about allergies at an early age. I had some respiratory symptoms that ultimately brought me to an allergy specialist who conducted skin tests and determined that I had a number of food allergies. From a child's perspective the most significant among these was chocolate. (Note the author's appeal for sympathy.) At times, skin tests and blood tests can prove useful in sorting out food reactions or suggesting possible problems, but the screenings that specific allergy or food sensitivity tests offer are incomplete. A food elimination and oral reintroduction challenge offers meaningful results and can help clarify whether a particular food is a problem for you. People with symptoms that don't suggest a specific diagnosis can often benefit from food elimination and reintroduction. First, a bit about food reactions.The term food allergy sometimes refers to a wide array of phenomena. Reviews of immune mediated food reactions have identified more than a dozen specific types of reactions. Of these, the most serious is anaphylaxis, which involves the closing of the airway that can lead to a trip to the emergency room or even death. I like the more restricted use of the term food allergy: reactions that are akin to anaphylaxis, or more technically Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated reactions. How prevalent are IgE food allergies? A reasonable contemporary estimation might be 5% of the adult population and 8% of children. We might call other food reactions sensitivities or intolerances. Food sensitivities tend to refer to reactions that are not caused by IgE antibodies, but are nonetheless driven by immune system reactions. An example of a food intolerance that is not caused by an immune system response is lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance is an inability to break down lactose, a sugar found in dairy products. As infants, our bodies make an enzyme that can break down lactose, but by adulthood as much as 25% of Americans no longer make this enzyme. The classic symptoms of lactose intolerance include abdominal cramping and diarrhea. The various types of food reactions, allergies, sensitivities, and intolerances, can trigger or contribute to a myriad of symptoms including but not limited to: digestive system issues such as constipation or diarrhea, excess gassiness, abdominal pain including classic gallstone symptoms, and feelings of bloating; rashes and skin complaints; joint pains; autoimmune conditions as diverse as thyroid disease and type I diabetes; respiratory symptoms including anaphylaxis, but also asthma; heart depression; ADHD; even schizophrenia.Elimination Diets \u2014 a Tool When Food is Causing ProblemsSustainable Health By Gaia Kile The question is not whether these foods are good or bad for us generally, but whether they are a problem for you in particular.

Ice Cream Alley Store Established in 2013, Go! Ice Cream is Ypsilanti's favorite go-to for artisan ice cream and vegan sorbets, made from organic, all-natural, and (when possible) local ingre - dients. Born on the back of a Workman tricycle, Go! Ice Cream has served its small batches of frozen treats at farmers' markets, local events like Ypsi's First Fridays and DIYpsi, and in neighborhoods, even delivering right to your door (per their website, \"$5 delivery fee to any address in Ann Arbor or Ypsilanti, FREE delivery for orders over $20\"). Pints are available for purchase from Ann Arbor's Argus Farm Stop and the Produce Station, as well as the Ypsilanti Food Coop. And now, after an exciting renovation process, Go! Ice Cream has its own Alley Store, complete with an old-fashioned soda fountain, located in downtown Ypsilanti near the corner of Michigan Avenue and North Washington Street. As of this writing, flavors include Br\u00fbl\u00e9ed Banana (made with real, organic bananas), Sweet Browned Butter (using Calder Dairy Farm Butter), Three-Bean Vanilla, Coffee and Cookies, and the popular dairy-free Chocolate Sorbet that promises \"maximum chocolate overload.\" In addition to handmade sodas and ice cream floats, the soda fountain at the Alley Store mixes up unique items like a Chocolate Egg Cream (an East Coast soda fountain favorite), and Pupsicles, which are \"beef-flavored ice cubes and a dental bone\" for canine customers. What I most appreciate about Go! Ice Cream is its unique flavors, sometimes tem - porarily available and based specific events or themes. At the yearly Festival of the Honey Bee in Ypsilanti, one of the Go! Ice Cream flavors of the evening included real honeycomb. DIYpsi's 2016 Winter Market had them teaming up with another local favorite, Fairytale Baked Goods (see article in CWJ issue 63), to create a Grinch sundae: ice cream topped with a green mint scone, fudge sauce, and two eyes made from sugar.One summer I was delighted by a s'mores sundae! The marshmallows were toasted right there at the cart with a cooking blow torch, served still warm and melting the ice cream just a touch. In fact, their unique sundaes have occasionally been the deciding factor for me heading out again after a long day at work. A limited-time-only ice cream sundae is not to be missed! Especially if it's from Go! Ice Cream. My tastebuds and I can't wait to see what they've got planned for this year. The Go!

Avalon Cafe and Kitchen Twenty years ago, in June of 1997, the delicious Avalon International Breads was born in Detroit, MI. In December of 2016, their first restaurant, Avalon Cafe and Kitchen, opened in downtown Ann Arbor at the corner of East Liberty Street and Fourth Avenue, in the original Pretzel Bell Building. When you enter, there are actually two parts to the business. To your right is the cof - fee bar, which has a casual seating area with an eclectic assortment of comfortable furniture. In addition to the usual coffee shop beverage offerings, there are pre-assembled sandwiches, salads, and yogurt cups. It's a convenient spot to stop in and grab, for example, a peppermint mocha and a strawberry fruit-on-the-bottom yogurt cup with granola (that tastes an awful lot like strawberry cheesecake - I recommend it) for a quick lunch-on-the-go. Or stay and hang out with friends in the lounge. Born on the back of a Workman tricycle, Go! Ice Cream has served its small batches of frozen treats at farmers markets, local events, and in neighborhoods, even delivering right to your door. What I most appreciate about Go! Ice Cream is its unique flavors. At the yearly Festival of the Honey Bee in Ypsilanti, one of the Go! Ice Cream flavors of the evening included real honeycomb. Go! Ice Cream: Sweet Browned Butter Ice Cream Sundae Avalon Cafe and Kitchen: Macchiato with Amazon Brownie and Whipped Cream The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 43 With Kouzina's casual, made-to-order counter service style, I can get my food with plenty of time to enjoy it before heading back to work. The food's authenticity is due to 75-year-old chef Panagiotis Laskaris, who worked at various restaurants in the Greektown area of Detroit during that neighborhood's heyday. There are actually two parts to the business. To your right is the coffee bar, which has a casual seating area... If you follow the ramp up to the left, though, you will find the caf\u00e9/restaurant. There is also a six-item kids menu and \"Fancy Toast\" items, taking full advantage of their bread-oriented heritage. The bread is made with 100% organic flour. If you follow the ramp up to the left, though, you will find the caf\u00e9/restaurant. I love the naked brick walls and old wood floors. Swaths of burlap are draped across the ceiling interspersed with evenly spaced star-shaped lamps. The atmosphere is casual, backyard elegant. Water is served in glass goblets, and the drink menu includes beer on tap (some are Avalon-exclusives, like the Jolly Pumpkin Ancient Egyptian Ale), wine, cocktails, a se-lection of teas, and specialty coffees. The dinner menu is divided into Start and Share (appetizers), Bun and Bread (burgers and sandwiches), Fork (entrees), Bowl (a salad and vegetable dishes), Sides, and Desserts. There is also a six-item kids menu and \"Fancy Toast\" items, taking full advantage of their bread-oriented heritage. The bread is made with 100% organic flour. Avalon also promises (per their web- site) \"organic ingredients when possible, local ingredients whenever feasible, and environmentally friendly practices at every opportunity.\" They are a \"right livelihood\" business, which means they are promoting positive social change with their busi - ness. The care and emphasis on quality shows in the food's freshness. The egg yolks are rich in color and flavor. The pickled vegetables are crisp, not mushy. And the cultured butter spread on a thick slice of grilled farm bread is simple and deeply satisfying. I could happily devour half a loaf while sipping on a salted caramel latte, but I really sank my teeth into the more substantial mushroom burger on a challah roll. I had assumed it would be a portobello mushroom top, but it was like a patty made of mushroom stuffing, reminding me fondly of Thanksgiving dinner. I look forward to trying what else the Kitchen comes up with, and with a motto like \"Eat Well. Do Good,\" Avalon is a company to keep your eyes on. Avalon Cafe and Kitchen is located at 120 East Liberty in Ann Arbor and online at avalonbreads.net. Their phone number is (734) 263-2996. Hours of operation are Monday through Thursday from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., Friday from 7 a.m. to 12 a.m., Saturday from 8 a.m. to 12 a.m., and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Kouzina Greek Street Food 332 South Main Street in downtown Ann Arbor, Michigan, the former location of Middle Kingdom restaurant, sat vacant for some time. Many watched with anxious eyes, wondering when - if! - anyone would move in. Then we watched, excited, as the building was gutted and transformed in June 2016 into Kouzina Greek Street Food, their second location (after downtown Royal Oak). So not only is our new neighbor a local, Michigan-based restaurant, but perfect for a quick, healthy lunch in busy downtown! As a downtown employee, I am always on the lookout for new places to procure my lunch. With Kouzina's casual, made-to-order counter service style, I can get my food with plenty of time to enjoy it before heading back to work. I can even order online and have it delivered if I'm really short on time, or just don't feel like walking that day (this is really handy in winter \u2014 sorry, delivery person!). Ordering is simple. First, you pick if you want a gyro in a pita, rice bowl (rice pilaf or brown rice), or Greek salad, regular or large size. Next, the meat choices are chicken, pork, and lamb (or all), or order it vegetarian if you prefer. Toppings are plentiful! There are onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, roasted red peppers, beets, and olives, just to name a few. Sauce choices include sweet tomato sauce, tzatziki (the classic yogurt-cucumber sauce), and zesty feta sauce. My favorite combi - nation is a rice pilaf bowl with chicken, tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, cucumbers, spinach, chickpeas, and feta cheese. My mouth is watering just thinking about it... Side options include homemade, hand-cut fries (rendered even tastier with feta crumbled on top), pita chips, rice pilaf, spinach pie, chicken lemon rice soup (a.k.a. avgolemono), vegetarian lentil soup, and more. If you've still got room, I suggest the baklava or bougatsa, a \"warm custard wrapped in filo dough, sprinkled with cinna - mon and powdered sugar,\" for dessert. For $12.75, I can get a healthy and filling lunch of my usual chicken rice bowl (regular size), a bowl of soup, and a bottle of Coke, and since that's over the $10 minimum requirement, I can also have it brought to me for free. (Yes, I said free delivery!) If you check Kouzina's website, you will also find their catering menu, which is more diverse than the restaurant menu, but still authentically Greek. They require 24-hour notice for catering orders. The food's authenticity is due to 75-year-old chef Panagiotis Laskaris, who worked at various restaurants in the Greektown area of Detroit during that neighborhood's heyday. He came out of a 10-year retirement to return to the kitchen with his son, owner Bobby Laskaris. Kouzina Greek Street Food has two locations: 121 North Main Street, Royal Oak, Michigan (phone: 248-629-6500) and 332 South Main Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan (phone: 734-997-5155). Both locations can be found online at gokouzina.com and are open daily from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Kouzina: Greek Gyro Bowl with Chicken and Fresh topping for made-to-order menuAvalon Cafe and Kitchen: Cafe baked goods wall By Angela Madaras Well-Fed on a Budget Part 2 of 2: a Sampling of Global Fare Temptation to order beyond ones means and \"pig out\" has become woven into our psyche with popular culture's special interest in all things food-centric.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 44 In the last issue of The Crazy Wisdom Journal , I wrote part one for this series, which focused on enjoying local American fare on a budget. I proved I could eat quality tasty food from local eateries, prepared by the hands of skilled chefs, all for a reasonable price. Good food can be easy on the wallet at every level of the dining experience when one exercises discipline and knows where to look. Temptation to order beyond ones means and \"pig out\" has become woven into our psyche with popular culture's special interest in all things food-centric. For proof of this, look no further than two of the United States' most popular mainstays: the all-you-can-eat buffet and the super-sized fast food meal. I respect these dining options but I've found I can satiate myself in higher-end restaurants by ordering with intention. In this concluding part of my budget dining series, I will introduce you to a variety of global fare from West Ann Arbor to downtown Ypsilanti, all of which boast quality, healthful products for any budget and any taste preference. MI COMPADRE is conveniently located on Packard Street, across from Morgan and York (reviewed in part one of this series) in Ann Arbor. This Mexican restaurant is family owned by cooks who have a unique way of preparing their ceviche and seafood soup. Both seafood dishes are tomato-onion based with a certain sweetness that tastes like a fusion of Central American and Thai. It's a great place to meet a crowd even though the dining area is not large. It is set up in a way tables can be easily moved around the brightly painted interior. They are usually playing lively music or a soccer game on television. Mi Compadre does not serve alcohol; however, they have traditional beverages worth trying like horchata, tamarindo, and liquor-free sangria. I highly recommend sharing the Ceviche de Shrimp and their homemade guacamole. Their tacos are very economical, flavorful, and traditional. By traditional , I mean the taco shells are soft. They will bring as many free chips as you want and two kinds of housemade salsas. I can eat lunch here for under ten bucks, and on some days tacos are two for three dollars. If you're a fan of this kind of Mexican food but can't make it to the restaurant, you'll be happy to know Mi Compadre also recently started to operate a food truck that moves about town. SEVA was a downtown Ann Arbor institution for vegetarians for many years. I found it to be my favorite restaurant in the mid to late 80's. It was the first restaurant where I dined by myself at age 19. I felt very grown-up and mature having a candlelight dinner all by myself. It was a rite of passage for this food lover. I eat at Seva more since they moved to the Westgate Shopping Center, off Jackson Avenue and S. Maple Road. I love the ambiance, although it can be very loud due to hard floors, wood furniture, high ceilings, and wide open space. That being said, the stained glass that once donned the original store's windows exist here in the new location. But the food is the main topic. For a budget meal, I love their salad menu with side items and add-ons from which to choose. I generally grab a salad with dressing/sauce and two sides (brown rice and steamed broccoli are my usual choices) for under ten bucks. For breakfast, I suggest the Eggs Veracruz. You cannot go wrong with their Mexican specials! Finally, for desert you also will be delighted with daily specials that would make any sweet tooth dance for joy. Whether vegan or vegetarian, you will find many satisfying and creative meal options at Seva.STAR'S CAF\u00c9 , also located in the Westgate Shopping Center, offers Middle Eastern favorites for an extremely reasonable price. They specialize in lunch and dinner but are open most mornings at 8:00 a.m. for coffee, pastries, and freshly made juices. Their sandwiches are satisfying enough by themselves for around six dollars, or make it a combo for a couple bucks more, which allows you to add a cup of soup or fries. The fries are crispy as all get out. They bring them piping hot in a large basket with plenty to share. Fresh juices are made-to-order depending on the season's availability. I crave the carrot-apple-celery juice combination with a little parsley, but you can create your own. I am also completely infatuated with their refreshing housemade Chicken Lemon-Rice Soup. This flavorful soup contains ample amounts of carrots, celery, and onions finely diced in a light, non-creamy chicken broth with rice, lemon juice, and black pepper undertones. For vegetarians, Star's Caf\u00e9 has many options, but the ones my friends seem to gravitate towards are the falafel or cauliflower sandwiches and the lentil soup. Of course, there's also the usual Middle Eastern fare of hummus, baba ghanoush, fattoush, tabbouli, and stuffed grape leaves, to name just a few. There is a new kind of Greek street food in Ann Arbor found within KOUZINA'S hip new Main Street eatery. Similar to Chipotle-style ordering, you walk up to a large counter with a glass half-wall protecting salad bar-style containers filled with freshly prepared vegetables, dips, sauces, and toppings for their homemade gyros. Beyond this, thick and long gyro meat slabs sizzle and slowly spin on large metal skewers over a low heat. A top hat of tomato and onion drizzle juices down onto the rotisserie as it roasts the tender, juicy, yet crisp, lamb-beef combo. There are two other meat options, chicken and pork, plus a veggie option. Onto a plate go your grilled pita, and then your protein of choice. Add from a wide variety of homemade condiments and fresh toppings to self-create your perfect gyro. If you prefer, Kouzina even make gluten-free pitas and offer a salad or rice bowl instead of a filled pita. Freshly cut fries jump out of the hopper plain or Greek-style with feta and oregano. Traditional Greek salad and lemon chicken rice soup are staples, as are the pastries and spinach pies. You can definitely fill your belly, with a little extra to take home, for ten bucks. Eat inside or out on a private patio. Or avoid eating \"out\" altogether by getting takeout or having them deliver. DALAT has been serving up homemade Vietnamese food to the lucky residents of downtown Ypsilanti for 25 years.

Lunchtime is not as busy as dinner, but service can still be a little slow. I prefer to order from the dinner menu as it is their most comprehensive of menu choices. The dish names are written in Vietnamese with English descriptions of just the ingredients and are somewhat vague. For example, I would like to know what type of sauce or flavor profile exists within the mix of ingredients. One of the most popular dishes is Pho Tai Nam, a traditional beef-based rice noodle soup with medium well-done beef brisket, cilantro, and scallions. It comes with a side of bean sprouts, lime wedges, and sliced jalape\u00f1os for seven dollars and fifty cents. However, through several flavorsome visits, I discovered that I prefer Ga Xao Sa Ot. Concocted with stir-fried chicken, lemongrass, chili sauce, and onion on a bed of chopped iceberg lettuce, it is served with steamed white rice. I also always get a large pot of hot green tea to share because they do not offer free refills on any of their beverages. WHITE LOTUS FARM'S CREAMERY AND BAKERY reside within a private Buddhist community and rich farmland. On the last Saturday of each summer month, the community members provide an open farm day with a farm stand selling their freshly baked breads, pastries, fresh craft goat cheese, hot coffee, a summer infused iced tea, handmade soaps, and organic produce. The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is at exactly 11:30 a.m. when a line begins to form for wood-fired pizza orders. It fills fast and is first come, first served until they run out. The humble artisan-farmers offer pizza by the slice or by the whole pie, and you can choose to eat on the grounds or take it home. I have dined al fresco on site, but my favorite experience was in ordering a whole pie to accessorize with a variety of additional edible treasures at home. The pizza du jour was cheese and heirloom red peppers sans sauce. That alone was fabulous, but as a cook I had to add some embellishments. Once home, I gathered arugula, my homemade vodka-tomato sauce, thin slices of prosciutto, and pickled asparagus with which to manifest the perfect balance. The saltiness of the brined asparagus in harmony with the sweetness of peppers and tomato pottage connected the earthy chewiness of the meat atop a slightly smoky thin crust and, with the nutty melted cheese, filled us to the core in a most profound way. At the end of the day, there are a plethora of choices all laid out on a platter from which to choose healthy, quality, crafted meals for under ten dollars. I challenge each of our readers to explore the culinary treats of greater Ann Arbor on their own and let me know what you find. I will post reasonable reviews on my blog: angelasguide.blogspot.com. The more we can share our experiences, the more attention gets placed on quality over quantity, and fiscal restraint can be happily attained within our little bubble of Southeast Michigan. Please note: before visiting these establishments, always check their hours on their website or by phone, as they may change seasonally.

We will still feel sluggish, bloated, irritable, and \"hangry\" ! Slow down and relax before eating \u2014 digestion works when we are in a parasympathetic/relaxed state. Taking a few relaxing breaths before eating can help a lot!by Karen Lang As a nutritional therapy practitioner, I have worked with many clients to improve their digestion with some very simple techniques. In this article, I will explain how digestion is supposed to work, what happens when things go wrong, and some key things we can do to improve our digestion. Digestion is key to our health. We may be eating the healthiest foods, but if we aren't digesting properly, we will not get the benefit. We will still feel sluggish, bloated, irritable, and \"hangry\"! The good thing is there are some simple things we can do to help our bodies digest! First let's look at how digestion is supposed to work. Proper Digestion Digestion is a north to south process. Digestion actually starts in the brain . The sight and smell of food triggers the salivary glands to begin producing saliva and the body gets ready to ingest the food. We need to be in a relaxed (parasympathetic) state to properly digest food. Once food is in our mouths , the teeth break down the food into smaller pieces; saliva moistens the food and starts the chemical breakdown of carbohydrates (using salivary amylase). The food (now called bolus), travels to the stomach down the esophagus through the cardiac sphincter. Gastric juices in the stomach continue to breakdown the bolus. Hydrochloric acid kills bad bacteria and microbes and breaks down the food further. Once the bolus is at the right acidic level (1.5-3.0 pH), it travels to the small intestine through the pyloric sphincter. The bolus is now called chyme. The small intestine is made up of three sections (Duodenum, Jejunum, Ilium). The chyme is released into the Duodenum. pancreas releases bicarbonate to neutralize the acidic chyme. Pancreatic enzymes are released to further digest the food. Bile is released by the gallbladder into the small intestine to emulsify fats and allow for absorption. Peristalsis moves the digested chyme into the Jejunum. Millions of tiny hair-like fingers (villi) absorb nutrients. Most nutrients are absorbed in the small intestine. The mass passes through the Ilium and then into the large intestine through the ileocecal valve. The large intestine is made up of the ascending, transverse, descending and sigmoid colon. It is populated with trillions of beneficial bacteria. The colon recycles and captures water and many remaining nutrients are converted to vitamins K, some B vitamins and butyric acid. Some of which are used to nourish the colon lining and the remains are excreted. Digestion Gone Wrong Brain : As mentioned above, we need to be in a relaxed/parasympathetic state for digestions to work properly. Eating on the run doesn't allow the body to properly digest food. The body is focused on other things instead of putting effort toward digesting and absorbing nutrients. This can cause digestive upset \u2014 gas, heartburn, and malabsorption of nutrients. Mouth : If we do not chew our food well, we will have large pieces of food to digest, which puts a huge strain on the digestive system. Also, if we do not coat the food in saliva, we will not have the enzymes that start the breakdown of the food (e.g., salivary amylase). Stomach: Hydrochloric acid is very important to the digestive process. It can be reduced due to stress, high sugar and processed food consumption, nutrient deficiencies, allergies, alcohol consumption, and age. Without the proper acidity, the chyme will not be released into the small intestine on a timely basis. It can ferment, putrefy, and become rancid. This can back up into the esophagus, resulting in heartburn. It can also feed the bad microbes in our gut and cause damage throughout the digestive tract. The food may sit in the stomach until we eat again, when it is pushed to the small intestine and can irritate the lining causing ulcers and worse. Taking antacids will relieve the symptoms, but actually make the problem worse. Small Intestine: If digestion up stream was not functioning optimally, it can cause many issues in the small intestine, such as ulcers, leaky gut, malabsorption of nutrients, autoimmune issues, and food allergies. Large Intestine/Colon : Any issues in the digestive process end up in the colon. Maldigested foods can clog the ileocecal valve and disrupt the healthy gut flora. This can lead to irritable bowel syndrome and other disorders of the colon. Five Simple Steps to Improve Digestion There is hope. Below are five things you can try to improve your digestion. 1. Slow down and relax before eating \u2014 digestion works when we are in a parasympathetic/relaxed state. Taking a few relaxing breaths before eating can help a lot. 2. Chew our food well \u2014 don't worry about counting, just chew until you can't recognize the consistency of the food. This helps by using both chemical (salivary amylase) and mechanical breakdown of food so that it is easy to digest. 3. Stay hydrated during the day, but don't drink too much while eating. Digestion takes a lot of water, but drinking too much while you are eating can lower the acidity level in your stomach and can slow digestion. Sip a lot of water during the day, but only a small amount around meals. 4. Reduce/Eliminate processed foods and added sugar. Eating processed foods and added sugars can upset the microbe balance in our guts and lead to dysbiosis (when bad microbes outnumber the good microbes). 5. Stop eating before we get full. Eating too much puts a huge strain on digestion. Stop eating when you feel comfortable, but not full. It takes about 20 minutes for our brains to realize we've had enough (the slower we eat, the better our brain can keep up with what is going on). Another thing that can help digestion is sipping water with apple cider vinegar added to your water and drink it either 15 minutes prior to eating or sip during your meal. To make, add 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar (the cloudy, unfiltered kind \u2014 e.g., Bragg) to \u00bc cup of water. Karen Lang is a nutritional therapy practitioner working in Ann Arbor. Nutritional therapy (NT) is a growing field based on the idea that most disease is a result of the foods we eat \u2014 either due to nutritional deficiencies, eating too much food, or eating the wrong foods. On the flip side, eating high-quality whole foods can help improve health. Karen can be contacted at healthybalnutrition@gmail.com. THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEMto Improve Digestion and 5 Ways TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE \u2014 FOOD AS MEDICINE Have you ever caught a cold, and then been practically force-fed chicken soup and made to rest by your grandmother? This is a common memory across many cultures. What did your grandmother know? Quite a lot according to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The ancient Chinese saw qualities in food that went beyond calorie, fat, carbohydrate, and protein content. They observed health benefits in a food's flavor, temperature, nature, and function. They found that combining foods according to these properties could have positive effects on our health. Yang Sheng, or life nourishing practices, are used not only to keep a person healthy but also to extend his or her life. The ancient Chinese truly viewed food as medicine! About 100 years ago, the common diet consisted of mostly grains and vegetables. Most people ate meat only once or twice a week. Because refrigeration wasn't widely available, people ate what was in season and what could be stored in a root cellar through pickling, fermenting, salting, and drying. Sugar was too expensive for most people to afford, except in small amounts from sources like honey and syrups. It was also known that affluent people who ate too richly and exercised too little were more prone to chronic health conditions than others who lived more modestly. Approximately 2000 years ago, the Chinese wrote the Huangdi Neijing (The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Chinese Medicine). The first chapter was about eating modestly and with the seasons. Food has two natures that should be taken into account: \"Wei,\" which nourishes and constructs substance in the body (think of a juicy steak), and \"Qi,\" which promotes function and imparts energy (rice is a good example). Wei foods are harder to digest, but they build the body up. Qi foods are easy to digest and usually go straight to energy. When a person is ill, he or she should eat easy-to-digest foods that are mostly Qi. Grandmother's chicken soup was mostly Qi (liquid, cooked veggies, rice or noodles) and slightly Wei. The words \"flavor\" and \"temperature\" have deeper meanings in TCM. There are six flavors, and each has a different action within the body. Acrid or spicy tastes function to disperse, invigorate, and promote circulation. Think of sweating out a cold using spicy chicken soup. The sour taste is used to absorb and consolidate fluids. Remember how your lips pucker and your mouth waters when you suck on a lemon? Sour-flavored foods are used to help stop abnormal sweating. Bitter tasting substances have the action of drying dampness and clearing internal heat. As an example, eating kale is used to eliminate edema. Salty foods help to soften and dissolve hardness in the body. Traditionally kelp was eaten to treat goiter. The sweet taste has the action of fortifying and harmonizing the body. This is why a person is drawn to sweet taste when he or she is experiencing low energy. The temperature of food is more than just its physical temperature \u2014 TCM also considers the nature of the food. Foods encourage a certain \"temperature\" in the body. I'm from Phoenix where it regularly reaches 115 degrees in the summer, and, on a summer day, nothing tasted better than a barley salad with cucumber dressing and fruit for dessert. That type of meal had a cool, fluid nourishing balance, which was perfect for the season. Most fruits have a cooling nature, while most meats have a warming nature. To balance the body, eat warming foods in the colder months and cooling foods in the warmer months. This is easy to do if you eat with the seasons. So, how can you use this information? At the heart of Chinese nutrition is the \"Qing Dan\" or \"clear bland\" diet, which is very similar to a hypoallergenic diet. It consists of mostly grains, vegetables, legumes, and some fruit. There is less emphasis on meats, oils, fermented, chilled, and uncooked foods. To deal with constitutional or acute issues, different types of foods are added to the base diet. If one is constitutionally cold, for instance, then more warming and spicy foods are added. If someone is robust and red in the face, then cooling and bland foods are emphasized. The winter is a time for quiet reflection, but, by the time spring and summer hit, people are ready to get out and move. It is very easy to get overheated when having fun on the first warm days of the season. Below is an example of a cooling soup that tastes great, is good for you, and will help to cool you off during the warmer months. Melon Soup 3 cups cubed watermelon1 medium-sized cucumber\u00bc cup cooked mung beans3 slices raw ginger\u00bc cup mintwater Place the ingredients in the refrigerator for about two hours. Then peel, halve, and take the seeds out of the cucumber. Blend the watermelon, cucumber, ginger and \u00bd of the mint in a blender. You might have to add a bit of water to get a smooth consistency. Pour into a bowl and add the mung beans. Chop the rest of the mint and garnish the soup. Enjoy! According to Chinese Medicine, watermelon has a nature and flavor that is sweet and cooling. Its functions are to moisten, clear heat, and to disperse swelling. Modern research has shown that watermelon is a diuretic and a great source of Lycopene, which may help lower blood pressure and be cardioprotective. Cucumbers are cooling in nature and may help to clear heat and protect against the irritability that comes from becoming overheated. Mung beans clear heat and toxins from the body. They function to help the skin stay clear. Since they are high in fiber and protein, they will give the soup some staying power. Mint is spicy and cooling in nature. It is thought to promote sweating, which in turn cools the body. It clears heat from the head and so can help with headaches, red eyes, and stress from being overheated. Ginger is warm and spicy. Chinese medicine is concerned with balance, and too many cold or cooling foods can unbalance the body, so ginger is added to the melon soup to aid in digestion. Its spicy nature can also help to promote sweating, which helps to cool you off. Bob Flaws has written two great books on this subject: The Tao of Healthy Eating and The Book of Jook. Both are available at Crazy Wisdom. Bart Vermilya, R.Ac., is a registered acupuncturist and holds a Masters in Oriental Medicine (MScOM) from the Phoenix Institute of Herbal Medicine and Acupuncture. He started practicing martial arts to deal with stress, and after three high level black belts, still likes to be a student as well as a teacher.

So why should you be eating it? According to many in the medical-nutritional field, liver is an excellent source of high quality protein; contains an abundance of vitamin A and several B vitamins; is an excellent source of folic acid and iron; is the number one food source of copper; and contains CoQ10, which is important for cardiovascular function. Chicken livers and beef livers are easy to come by at your local butcher shop, from a farmer, and a neighborhood meat processor. I call the processor who cuts up my half of a cow, which I buy from my farmer friend, and I tell him I want all the livers, hearts, and sweetbreads (thymus gland) that others do not want. I think it runs $2.00 per pound. When we raised chickens I had plenty and would make it a ritual that on the day we culled, I kept all livers for saut\u00e9ing with lots of onions and garlic for that night's meal. Chicken liver is sweet and hearty with lots of black pepper, garlic, thyme, a little cinnamon, a small amount of grated nutmeg, a tad salt, and lots of Worcestershire sauce. I mash it slightly so I can easily serve it over rice with the onions or spread it on toast points for an appetizer. In most German restaurants you will find a different version of chicken livers. They are rolled in flour and pan-fried. In the winter, I try to make liver pat\u00e9 at least a few times. It is a comforting and filling way to butter my toast or crackers. I love serving it for company with sweet spices because they cannot believe how good it tastes. It can be used to make a beef wellington instead of mushroom pat\u00e9. Try to get organic and grass fed. Liver is a cleansing organ so you want the animal to be healthy! I have compiled some organ meat recipes I prepared and liked. You may want to try them at a reputable restaurant first and experiment. Mexican restaurants usually have tripe soup which is intestine meat. They also make tongue, heart, liver, and sometimes sweetbreads. If it is on a taco, you can easily try one of each. Tripe soup is said to be a good treatment of hangovers. I have never tried it honestly, but it is a staple in Mexico that is served in the morning and all through the day. You might be able to find blood sausage if you live in a heavily German populated area like Detroit, and every store has liverwurst or Braunschweiger. My grandmother's favorite sandwich was Braunschweiger on white bread with mustard and a large slice of red onion. I love it to this day. Many Jewish delis serve chopped liver. My very favorite is Zingerman's Delicatessen in Ann Arbor, Michigan. They sometimes do not have it in the deli case, so just ask for it by the pound. It tastes amazing on a bagel with red onion and tomato. Try the following recipe for a Midwestern version of liver spread from The New Midwestern Table by Amy Thielen. It takes time and seems involved, but is well worth it.Homemade Braunschweiger 1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt, or more if needed 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper to taste 1 1/2 pounds fatty pork (either marbled pork butt or half pork butt, half fresh pork belly) 8 ounces slab bacon 8 ounces fresh pork liver 2 teaspoons canola oil 2 tablespoons salted butter plus more for the dish 1 large onion, diced 4 cloves garlic, sliced 6 tablespoons dry sherry 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon grated nutmeg 2 teaspoons dried marjoram 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice Pinch of cayenne pepper 1 cup shelled salted pistachios 1. Combine salt and pepper in a small dish. 2. Cut the pork and the slab bacon into 1-inch cubes and put them in a wide-bottomed 2-quart pot. (The pot should be large enough for the meat to fit almost in one layer, although a little double-up is okay.) 3. Add water to just cover and 1 teaspoon of the salt-and-pepper mixture, and bring to a simmer. 4. Cover, reduce the heat, and cook at a slow-bubbling simmer until the meat is very tender when poked with a fork, about 3 hours. 5. Uncover and drain, reserving 1/3 cup of the mixed juices and fat. Press plastic wrap on the surface of the meat and chill in the refrigerator. 6. Meanwhile, prepare the liver by rinsing the liver, blot it dry on paper towels, and cut it into 1-inch cubes. 7. Heat a two-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, and when it's hot, season the meat with a bit of the salt-and-pepper mixture. (I prefer to cook liver in cast iron, but any heavy-bottomed pan will work.) 8. Add the canola oil to the skillet and when the oil is hot, add the liver. 9. Sear the liver on all sides until browned then add 1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt, or more if needed, and 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, or more if needed. 10. Brown the liver for 5 minutes or so until the outside is brown, but inside remains pink. 11. Take out of pan and set aside in a large rimmed bowl. 12. Add to same pan 2 teaspoons canola oil 2 tablespoons salted butter, plus more for the casserole dish, 1 large onion, diced 4 cloves garlic, and sliced 6 tablespoons dry sherry. 13. Allow this to cook at medium heat for 20 minutes stirring occasionally. Then at very end, add 1 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1 teaspoon grated nutmeg, 2 teaspoons dried marjoram, 1 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice, and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Stir constantly for 5 minutes more and turn heat off. 14. Place all these ingredients on top of liver in the bowl and refrigerate until very cold. 15. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Fit a grinder with a fine blade (I use the grinder attachment for my stand mixer). Alternately, feed the chilled cooked meat and liver mixtures through the grinder. Then grind the entire mixture again, this time into the bowl of a stand mixer or a heavy mixing bowl. 16. Add the remaining salt-and-pepper mixture and the nutmeg, marjoram, allspice, and cayenne pepper. 17. Drizzle in half of the reserved rich cooking juices. 18. Whip with the paddle attachment (or a hand mixer) until these final seasonings have been completely incorporated. 19. Add the rest of the cooking juices and whip until fluffy. This Isn't Your Grandmother's Chopped Liver by Angela Madaras According to many in the medical-nutritional field, liver is an excellent source of high quality protein; contains an abundance of vitamin A and several B vitamins; is an excellent source of folic acid and iron; is the number one food source of copper; and contains CoQ10, which is important for cardiovascular function. Chicken liver is sweet and hearty with lots of black pepper, garlic, thyme, a little cinnamon, a small amount of grated nutmeg, a tad salt, and lots of Worcestershire sauce.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 49 20. Fry a small amount of the pat\u00e9 in a small pan to taste for seasoning, and add more salt and pepper if desired. 21. Scoop the mixture into a lightly buttered glass or metal 9 x 4-inch loaf pan. 22. Smooth the top and press the pistachios into the surface. 23. Set the loaf pan in a larger baking pan and pour hot water into it to reach halfway up the sides of the loaf. NOTE: This recipe stakes its success on the freshness of the liver, which tastes sweet when brand new, but grows slightly bitterer with each passing day. Serves 20. *** Another easy way to integrate organ meats into your family's diet without them even knowing is by making meatloaf or meat balls. Albondigas soup is a hearty Spanish and Mexican stew made with meatballs, rice, vegetables, and stock. Normally ground beef, or maybe ground lamb, would be the base for the balls. Some chefs prefer a mix of several kinds of ground meats (turkey, pork, beef, veal, lamb) with a little less fat than normal so it holds together in the soup. The following recipe is one I adapted from SimplyRecipes.com. I find this recipe to be easy and accessible. You can use frozen vegetables in the winter months and any ground meat you like, but don't forget we are sneaking in some organ meat. Let's try ground beef heart. Ask your butcher to procure a cow heart, clean it, and grind it with a mix of whatever meats you like or he recommends for the balls. You could use any organ you fancy. Albondigas Soup 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 large white sweet onion 3 large cloves minced garlic 3 quarts chicken stock or cut in half and use water for the other half 1/2 cup tomato sauce or chopped tomatoes 1/2 lb string beans cut into one inch pieces 2 large sliced carrots 1/3 cup raw white rice 1 pound ground meat (I would make more and freeze them. In this case double everything) 1/4 each chopped fresh parsley and mint leaves (always abundant in spring) 1 raw egg 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon black pepper Tad of cayenne 1 1/2 cup frozen or fresh peas 1 teaspoon dried oregano (try to find Mexican Oregano) Salt and pepper 1/2 cup fresh cilantro for garnish I added finely diced jalapenos mixed with finely diced red onion and tomato for additional garnish on the side for people to add their own. Put hot sauces out for those who like a lot of heat. Sour cream can be used to lower intensity. Also serve with tortilla chips, salsa, guacamole lime wedges, and sliced radish. *** Sweetbreads are from the thymus glands traditionally. I have heard some people use other glands, as well. They look like raw chicken nuggets, but have a smell all their own. Make this dish when you can have windows open and when only people who like this type of food will be coming over for dinner. I made this recipe, adapted from cookingchannel.com, one afternoon for the first time, but was surprised to find out midway through the recipe that I had an unexpected visitor. I was taking this dish to a birthday party, so I finished as fast as I could, placed it in a casserole dish, covered it with foil, then placed it in the fridge. I spent an hour airing out my house with fans, filters, and sprays to get the heavy metallic odor out of the house. In the end, the house smelled OK, but there was a little hint of it for a day or two. Everyone raved about how good it was, and, thankfully, no one mentioned the smell. Sweetbreads and Mushroom Pasta 2 ounces unsalted butter 1 ounce mushroom trimmings 6 cloves garlic 2 stalks celery 1 bay leaf (I used 2) 1 carrot, chopped (I used 2) 1 leek, chopped and cleaned in cold water 1 large onion, chopped 1-3 sprigs fresh thyme 1 quart dry white wine 8 cups stock or broth 1 pound fresh-brined sweetbreads or hearts cut into small chunks 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter Two cups of cleaned and sliced mushrooms (porcini, cremini, portabella, etc.) Egg Noodles (only use the best here) 1 small bag frozen peas 1 cup grated parmesan cheese 2 teaspoons salt and black pepper Juice of one lemon and zest of lemon 4-6 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto gently torn atop each serving 1/2 cup chopped parsley sprinkled on top of each serving 2 raw asparagus spears shaved on top of each serving 1. Wash off meat and place all sweetbreads in a brine of saltwater and a cup of white vinegar for at least 2 hours in the fridge. 2. Take each one out of brine with a slotted spoon and place in a colander that sits on a plate. 3. Pour out brine and wash the container well with soap and vinegar. The vinegar helps clear the odor as well as clean. 4. Pat the sweetbreads dry with paper towels and set aside. First you make a ragu with the mushrooms, leeks, herbs, vegetables, wine, and stock, then add sweetbreads after stock has cooked down and thickened. 1. For the ragu, you want to saut\u00e9 all the vegetables and herbs with butter until golden brown. 2. Add wine to deglaze pan and let it cool down a bit. Add to the broth or stock. 3. Poach the sweetbreads in the wine and broth at a boil for 10 minutes. 4. Take out sweetbreads and set aside while you strain the liquid form the ragu. 5. Discard ragu remnants but use the stock later when you bake the pasta. 6. In a large frying pan get butter melted add mushrooms, onions, and sweetbreads until golden brown. Stir constantly. 7. The water should be at boil for pasta. Add pasta and peas and boil for 2 minutes then strain. 8. Mix the pasta with the ragu-stock and the cheese. 9. Place in large casserole dish. Add lemon zest and juice of lemon. 10. Cover with parchment paper and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. If it seems dry, drizzle olive oil over the top, add some of the stock and more cheese. I like to use garnish with parsley, asparagus shavings, and prosciutto. If you want to be real fancy you can make gravy with the stock and a little butter, flour, and wine. Use the same spices and herbs for flavor profile. Serve with crusty bread. At the end of the day, one must decide for themselves if organ meat is going to make it to their table and belly. My hope when starting this article was to offer guidance, information, and, perhaps, inspiration for those who want to dabble in the culinary adventures of \"offal.\" After sharing the pat\u00e9 recipe with a good friend, who had been a long time vegetarian, she surprised me by asking if she could come to my kitchen and make liver pat\u00e9 together as a tutorial. That alone encouraged me to share my recipes here. I sincerely hope you are inspired to venture into new meaty territory as well.

Outdoor cats have an average life expectancy of only three years due to the hazards of predation, disease, and accidental death. Once confined indoors, your cat still retains its natural behaviors, such as scratching, chewing, and elimination, and has a need for environmental enrichment to provide an outlet for these behaviors. Dr. Tony Buffington, a professor emeritus at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine, spearheaded the Indoor Cat Initiative for environmental enrichment. (Further information can be found at indoorpet.osu.edu. He also offers a course on iTunes called U Course Cat Mastery.) Environmental enrichment has gained particular relevance now that animal welfare legislation mandates that owners are responsible for allowing an animal to continue normal behavior patterns as an indoor pet. Without environmental enrichment, a boring environment contributes to health and behavior problems for your cat, so it is an essential part of your responsibility for your cat's well-being and quality of life. The larger implication of environmental enrichment is that it cuts down on the number of cats surrendered to shelters because of behavioral problems and the possibility of euthanasia depending on the shelter. Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (FLUTD) and urine marking because of stress are primary reasons cats are surrendered to shelters. FLUTD is one of the health consequences indoor cats face without environmental enrichment, which is a connection that has been made for a long time, although the etiology is unknown. Practical enrichment strategies to prevent behavioral and associated health problems include your cat's: 1) physical environment or space; 2) nutritional needs for food and water; 3) social contact; 4) elimination and litterboxes; and 5) behavioral, involving play activities. Cats are sensory driven and need tension releases as they are not meant to be sedentary. By providing your cat energy outlets, your cat will have enough stimulation and not be driven to destructive behaviors out of boredom. Physical Environment Cats live in a vertical world and are territorial. They climb (as they do in the wild) for observation and safety. They like a predictable routine and need hiding and perch areas for security where they can feel safe from people and other animals in the house. You can provide a tall cat tree with curved perches that will not tip over. Cat window perches to observe animals outdoors and window bird feeders will keep your cat entertained. Create a tasteful cat super highway on your wall by purchasing premade curved shelves at a home improvement store,using furniture pieces for the on and off ramps. Jackson Galaxy, the Cat Behaviorist on Animal Planet, has written several illustrated books on Catification. You can also purchase connected tunnels for cats. In a multi-cat household, allow each cat enough social distance with adequate space for sleeping, eating, and lounging to prevent competition.Nutritional Enrichment Keep food bowls away from kitchen appliances, and in multi-cat households, do not share food bowls to avoid aggression. Separate bowls are best rather than divided bowls to prevent food spillage. Use a fountain water dispenser to supply fresh water. For dry food, use one of the food puzzle dispensers. For wet food, place small amounts in muffin tins to encourage slow eating, reduce vomiting, engage your cat's mind, and, to an extent, stimulate prey acquisition. Social ContactDespite the myth that cats are solitary creatures, they are social animals and need to spend time with you. Your cat will decide on the amount of time he/she wants to spend with you, and it's best to let your cat come to you. Some cats enjoy being petted and groomed while others prefer play. If you travel a lot, you might consider getting another cat to keep your original cat company. Cats usually view their home environment as a safe space. However, cats can perceive threats from dogs and humans, experience competition from other cats, and regard smaller animals within the home such as birds and fish, as prey. You need to be aware of what is active in your cat's world from your cat's point of view. Litter box issues can develop if an outdoor cat passing by the window is perceived as a threat by your indoor cat. EliminationLitter boxes should be placed in a safe, quiet area and kept clean. In multi-cat households, provide one for each cat. Unscented clumping litter works well. If a cat begins eliminating outside the litter box, this can be a sign of illness or territory issues. Your cat does not do this to be difficult, but is signaling something is wrong. A large plastic under bed box can accommodate larger cats and provide a sense of security. Behavioral EnrichmentEnvironmental enrichment allows cats to express their natural behaviors such as scratching, chewing, and playing by providing outlets for these behaviors. Scratching posts can be carpet, sisal, or wood, and placed near resting places or where your cat spends a great deal of time. Scratching posts can be seasoned with catnip. Chewing behavior can be directed to cat plants and grasses. Active play with your cat provides an outlet for predatory behaviors such as stalking, chasing, pouncing, and biting. If your cat is tired and thoroughly exercised, there is less chance for destructive behaviors. Cats enjoy playing with toys they can pick up, toss in the air, or pounce on. Use toys that keep distance from your body to avoid play-related aggression problems. Wand toys and battery operated toys should be rotated to maintain your cat's interest. You can reward with treats to replicate hunting prey during play sessions. Cat DVDs are also highly entertaining. Your cat may enjoy watching Animal Planet or Sesame Street while you are away. Environmental enrichment will ensure a healthy, joyful, and long relationship between you and your cat. Additionally, several health conditions such as FLUTD that may not have responded to traditional treatment in some cats, are relieved when environmental enrichment methods are instituted.

The Indoor Cat Initiative ~ Environmental Enrichment, or Looking at Life from your Cat's Point of View by Dr. Nancy Smaltz, DVM Nancy Smaltz, DVM Without environmental enrichment, a boring environment contributes to health and behavior problems for your cat, so it is an essential part of your responsibility for your cat's well-being and quality of life. Cats are sensory driven and need tension releases as they are not meant to be sedentary. By providing your cat energy outlets, your cat will have enough stimulation and not be driven to destructive behaviors out of boredom.In a multi-cat household, allow each cat enough social distance with adequate space for sleeping, eating, and lounging to prevent competition. Environmental enrichment allows cats to express their natural behaviors such as scratching, chewing, and playing by providing outlets for these behaviors.Use toys that keep distance from your body to avoid play-related aggression problems.

The Chronicle reported on the activities of local government. Launched in November 2014, the nonpartisan CivCity Initiative works to promote year-round civic responsibility and involvement by encouraging and educating citizens to participate in all aspects of governance. Joshua B. Kay: When did you come to Ann Arbor?Mary Morgan: In 1996, from Rochester, New York, where I was working for the Rochester Business Review. Kay: What brought you here? Morgan: I took a job with the Ann Arbor News. I was brought here to increase business coverage and cover the tech community, which did not previously have a reporter focused on it. I had a variety of positions there, including business editor, columnist, and, when I left in 2008, I was the opinion page editor. It was a great gig in many ways, but I wasn't happy with how the paper was going. At the time I was considering leaving, I thought there were important pieces of the community that weren't being covered or weren't being covered well, including many government entities. The News covered the city council and city government, and they covered to some extent the county board, but they didn't cover the library board and the DDA [Downtown Development Authority], entities that have significant authority, in some cases elected and in some cases appointed. [When we started the Chronicle ], I felt there was a lot that we could do well and comprehensively. Frankly, by that time, the technology barriers were low enough so that we didn't have to have a print publication. We didn't have the financial resources to publish in print, and with a couple of laptops and a domain name, it was conceivable to do.Kay: Do you have a sense of how many Chronicle readers you had? Morgan: We got 30,000-40,000 unique IPs [Internet protocol addresses] on a monthly basis. We didn't really track a lot of the metrics that other websites would track, so we didn't pay attention to page views or time on site, because we didn't want to sell the Chronicle to advertisers based on those metrics because we couldn't compete. But 30,000-40,000 unique IPs per month was pretty respectable. Kay: What was the Chronicle's business model? Morgan: We started off thinking it would be advertising only. We almost immediately started hearing from readers asking, \"Why can't we give you money as a subscription?\" They were getting something out of what we were doing, and they wanted to pay for it. So we set up a PayPal subscription option. Unless people opted out, we listed all of the subscribers, because we didn't want to get into the question of people wondering if we were backed by shadow individuals. By the end, it was 60 percent advertising and 40 percent subscriptions. With the Chronicle , we really were proud of what we were doing, and we did it for six years and it supported the two of us. We also paid all of our freelancers, and we're proud of that. We had an idea of what might need to be done to increase revenue. It involved creating a different kind of content or additional content that would drive site traffic to make a broader pool of advertisers willing to support us. But that's not the kind of publication that we wanted to run. Kay: Dave recently took a newspaper job with the Madison Daily Leader in South Dakota. How did that come about? Morgan: He really missed doing local journalism and came to the conclusion that it wasn't going to be possible to do that here in Ann Arbor. So he started applying for jobs in other parts of the country. All along, I've said I'm not just going to move wherever Dave found a job. I'm committed to CivCity, and it's not clear what I'd do in Madison, South Dakota. But there's a lot that's intriguing and really exciting about this for him. For one, we're definitely getting out of the Ann Arbor bubble, and given the political context in our nation, I think it's an interesting and important time to do something like that. I don't actually know what the community is like, Against Civic Apathy: Mary Morgan and the CivCity Initiative by Joshua B. KayPhotographs by Tobi Hollander Ann Arbor thinks of itself as this really great, \"we can do anything\" kind of place. I love this town, but I also recognize that there are a lot of things we could do but don't, and having a local newspaper that the community can be proud of is not happening. Continued on page 54When we closed the Chronicle, I started thinking about how the work of the Chronicle could be amplified in a different way. And I added the idea of an organization that would try to inspire and do outreach and try to provide educational opportunities, but not just in a traditional sense. CivCity intern Meghan Cuneo, left, with Mary Morgan at CivCity's Party at The Polls outside of the Slauson Middle School polling location on Election Day, Nov. 8, 2016The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 54 and that could shatter any assumptions I have, so that could be good, too, right? I'm certainly looking forward to hearing from him as he learns about the community there. But also it's an interesting move in terms of going to a small, family-owned, daily newspaper that is a viable enterprise and has been for well over a century. To put that in the context of our national media and what's happening in Ann Arbor, we can't sustain a daily paper. Ann Arbor thinks of itself as this really great, \"we can do anything\" kind of place. I love this town, but I also recognize that there are a lot of things we could do but don't, and having a local newspaper that the community can be proud of is not happening. Kay: Are there linkages between the missions of the Chronicle and CivCity? Morgan: I come from a place as a journalist of believing in openness and inclusiveness. When we did the Chronicle , we didn't have outreach and education as part of our mission, but we did believe that if people had more access to information, and if we pulled back the veil on how government operates, it would eliminate some barriers to participation. We found that a lot of people, even if they went to a meeting [of a governmental body], would have no idea what was happening or wouldn't understand the jargon. When we closed the Chronicle , I started thinking about how the work of the Chronicle could be amplified in a different way. And I added the idea of an organization that would try to inspire and do outreach and try to provide educational opportunities, but not just in a traditional sense of offering workshops or something. Instead, I really looked at education and motivation in a broad way. The idea is to saturate the community so that you're constantly bumping up against ways to make you think about what is happening and what the government is doing and providing ideas for how you can get involved, whether you're a kindergartner or a senior or anyone in between. So that's a pretty big idea. Geographically, we have a contained area to try to do that in. Some people ask, \"Why aren't you doing it in places like Ypsilanti or other parts of the country?\" We're trying to do a proof of concept [in Ann Arbor] with as many partnerships as we can create to have a high impact and start to change the culture and how people view their government. We want to break down that \"us versus them\" sense that \"those guys\" are making decisions and really help everyone understand instead that it's all of us. We are collectively either participating directly or electing our neighbors as representatives to act on our behalf, and that's a very interactive relationship. Kay: It sounds like after the Chronicle, you were reflecting on what you had accomplished and how you could grow certain elements of it. Morgan: Yes. I say this, though I have no data to back it up: let's just say there are a couple hundred people in town who understand in a deep way how government works, and they know most of the players in town, and they are the ones who have influence over public policy. So you have that small core. You see the same names come up over and over on boards and commissions, and in elected office and on campaign finance sheets. How do you make that a bigger core? I don't think we'll ever get everybody in the community intensely involved in that way, but surely there are a lot of bright people, people who are engaged in the world in other ways, oftentimes beyond the borders of our city. How do we get some of that attention diverted back into our own community? Over and over in elections, you have candidates who are unopposed. In this past election cycle, the mayor was unopposed. Several ward seats were unopposed. The county board is another example where the Ann Arbor representatives \u2014 there are three main districts \u2014 none of them had opponents in the primary and again in November. There are consequences to not having choices. We just don't have a very deep bench. People say, \"Well, we don't have very many Republicans here.\" Even if you accept that, there isn't very much competition at the primary level for Democrats, either. If you look at diversity on the city council, they tend to be pretty homogeneous as far as race and socioeconomic level, so that doesn't reflect all aspects of our community. I would love to have different voices and see a wider variety of representatives. And if you look at boards and commissions, they're not very diverse, either. How do we eliminate the barriers to participation, whether it's a lack of information or a lack of services like childcare for people when they need to go to [civic] meetings? Or is it just inspiring people to think about themselves in a different kind of role in the community? How do we, as a community, make those changes?Kay: CivCity's tagline is \"fighting civic apathy.\" Tell me about that. Morgan: What I hear regularly is \"I couldn't get in to participate because I didn't know the right people.\" Or there's this distaste for politics, and I think that reflects the national and state level. That's what the media focus on. That's where we get bombarded with the toxicity of political discourse. That gets translated to the local level even if people don't have any experience here. There's also competition for people's time. You have family responsibilities, entertainment options, professional constraints \u2014 you're competing for that. There's also a sense that Ann Arbor is doing okay, and it is okay. By many, many metrics it's a great place to live. People sort of have a sense of, \"Yeah, sure, somebody's taking care of that.\" Unless they have a perception that things are off the rails, they can let things coast. They don't need to know who's on the school board or even who's on the ballot. On the night before the election, maybe they'll call or email somebody they know and say, \"Who should I vote for for [University of Michigan] regent or whatever?\" It's good to know what issues are coming up so that if you want to weigh in, you can. Particularly in the kind of media landscape we have, I think a lot of people don't have that awareness of what decisions are in the pipeline now, so they don't know until the eleventh hour, when it's too late to weigh in, that this is something they can give feedback on. I'd like to increase that awareness, too. The barriers are time and attention, and it's a sense that if I do have time, do I really want to spend it thinking about city council or the library board or issues that are so beyond what I know at this point? We're trying to chip away at that by providing little ways to get a little bit of information over time so that you wake up one day and say, \"Oh yeah, I do know who my city council representative is, and this is going to be coming up on the agenda, and what do I think about that?\" And then have a conversation over dinner, or send an email about it. Kay: I saw on the CivCity website that you want to make participation fun. Morgan: I think you have to meet people where they are. You have to make it fun. You can inspire and make it fun while people learn, and then they will participate, even if it's just by having intelligent conversations about these issues. Kay: CivCity is nonpartisan. Is it progressive, in the sense that you're trying to advance a progressive agenda? Morgan: We are nonpartisan. \"Progressive\" carries with it a lot of baggage, I think, because it is associated with the Democratic party and liberal leanings. So I wouldn't Against Civic Apathy: Mary Morgan and the CivCity Initiative Continued from page 53 The idea is to saturate the community so that you're constantly bumping up against ways to make you think about what is happening and what the government is doing and providing ideas for how you can get involved. We want to break down that \"us versus them\" sense that \"those guys\" are making decisions and really help everyone understand instead that it's all of us.

How do we get some of that attention diverted back into our own community?use that word to describe our work at all. That said, social issues like poverty and other issues that governments and citizens can address to create a healthier community are definitely something we're interested in. Shouldn't we all be? Kay: So CivCity would provide information about candidates of any stripe?Morgan: Yes! I think our Ann Arbor Votes site did a way better job than any voter guide I saw at covering all of the candidates [in the last election]. I can't tell you how much time I put into finding information about them. My allegiance is to the voters, so I want to provide the spectrum of their options the best that I can. Kay: How are you getting the word out about CivCity? Morgan: That is a big challenge because we're on a shoestring budget. We use social media, and that reaches people to a certain extent. We have Facebook and Twitter accounts for both CivCity and Ann Arbor Votes, and I try to leverage my Facebook presence personally and try to publicize that way. Our general philosophy is to partner as much as possible, and part of how we spread the word in general about what we're doing is through partnerships. For example, I made posters about registering to vote with a link to AnnArborVotes.org. We're giving those to anyone who wants them, but we're also creating a distribution network. Food Gatherers gets a bunch to distribute to all of their food pantry partners, and the Ann Arbor Housing Authority posts them in their public housing complexes. Avalon Housing does that, too. Community centers get a bunch. We want to put them in libraries and in social service agencies like Ozone House. I would love to get a better network in places of worship, because I think those are important places for civics to have a presence, although there are widely varying degrees of acceptance. Some people say that goes against separation of church and state, and others are fine with it. We try to post in places around town that reach people in different demographics. It's about partnerships and networks that reach into places where people are for other reasons. I would love to partner with FestiFools and build a big \"citizen Ann Arbor\" puppet and have volunteers passing out information. So it can be fun and entertaining while getting in some information, and it is going out to where the people are. Kay: And what other projects are going right now or you're thinking about launching? Morgan: Ann Arbor Votes is a big deal. And this effort to increase the diversity of our boards and commissions, that's a pretty big thing that we're just in the initial stages of. I'd like to get an advisory group together to figure out what we can do realistically to start a news and information service, given our constraints. I've also asked one of our interns to push the city and county to see if we can create an election task force that would work collectively to publicize local elections. Another possibility, though I hesitate to mention it because it's just at the beginning stages... There's an organization in Seattle called Citizen University, and they've started doing something called Civic Saturdays. I love the idea of having a place and time people can get together and share information about what's coming up. I haven't made a lot of inroads into that yet. It would have to entail partnering with lots of organizations. I think it would be important not to just have it downtown but also at community centers and other places like library branches and maybe places of worship and community organizations or public housing sites in order to reach people who might not come downtown for something like this. Or coordinate it with things like food pantry pickups. Kay: It sounds like, at its core, there's a strong motivating belief that if you can reach people and invite them in, ultimately they're going to enjoy civic involvement.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 55 Morgan: Yes. The premise is that it's a good thing to be involved, and that people would, if given the right set of circumstances and opportunities, want to be involved. Not all at the same level, but we're living in a democracy, and I think the bigger goal is to heal our democracy and make it work. If you look at the national level and say, \"I wouldn't even know where to start,\" you might feel somewhat hopeless and small. So we can ask, \"What can I do where I am with what I have?\" I think that if everybody asks that question, they will find that it won't take forever and it's not hopeless. We do have problems, like poverty and economic disparity and homelessness. Why can't we fix those within our community? We should fix them nationally, but let's at least fix them where we live. We're not an advocacy group for ending those problems, but we are an advocacy group for giving people the tools and the interest, for trying to inspire them in whatever way they might want to participate, to then address those problems themselves. In our strategic plan for CivCity, we say that we're trying to increase civic access and participation, particularly for marginalized groups, low-income residents being among those. We're trying to expand access and bring a wider group of people to the table. Learn more at www.civcity.org or call (734) 645-5368.

He worked with a traveling nurse caring for people, particularly tuberculosis patients, in rural villages in the mountains. He stayed in Asia for two years after his Peace Corps stint, \"Wandering, vagabond style,\" adds Paul, picking up his story. \"I was almost all the time outdoors, even nighttime. I walked everywhere up in the mountains and along the coasts, all over India, Thailand, Burma, Philippines, Nepal. What Asia did for me was crystallize my spiritual pursuit, and crystallized my relationship to nature and food and how that could be a basic vehicle for service.\" Paul shifts the focus. \"Annie was born in 1956, and she likes to tell folks that she was conceived in Alaska, and that there were even some moose involved.\" (Delighted, prolonged laughter and we move on.) Growing up in New Jersey, Annie was the oldest of six children and, like Paul, she was her mother's main assistant, in her case helping to raise her younger siblings. Her father was a biology teacher in the local high school, and the family was politically very progressive, particularly around issues of race. In her teens Annie started working \"across the tracks\" at an after school program for African American kids. \"Our family encouraged us to not even think about color. We had three heroes that my parents taught us: Gandhi, Jesus Christ, and Martin Luther King. So we just followed those teachings, and when I worked there, it wasn't like, 'Here are these poor black children and me,' it was just, 'Here's some kids that need some help and want to have some fun.'\" Paul chimes in, \"I think that was a pretty amazing thing, that during that period, in the early 1970s, when people were trying to figure out how to dissolve the race barrier, you were just doing it. You were just living it naturally. Anyways, you got off to a good start.\" Annie teases Paul, \"You talked a lot more about me than I got to talk about you.\" Paul laughs, \"OK, let's move on to the next topic.\" They met at Ann Arbor's Wildflour Bakery in 1984 after Paul returned from his travels in Asia. Annie was working there, having moved from New Jersey earlier. \"We The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 56 The 2017 planting, growing, and harvesting season will be Annie Elder and Paul Bantle's last at the Community Farm of Ann Arbor. The two have been the head farmers tending the land and the animals there for more than 25 years. Even before they began working at the Farm, they were deeply entwined with the Ann Arbor community through their associations with the Wildflour Community Bakery, the Soy Plant, and Eden's Restaurant (all three were natural food establishments of the seventies and eighties). But early in 2018 the couple will be moving to California to start the next phase of their lives. Aptly enough, on the morning of November 8, 2016 \u2014 talk about big changes \u2014 Paul, Annie, and I sat in the greenhouse on the Farm and talked about how they came to be at the Farm, what it has been like to care for it for over a quarter century, who will take over, what will change once they leave, and what's in their future. Annie and Paul both have ruddy, weathered faces, attesting to their many years of outdoor work. Annie has long silver hair, while Paul sports a full beard and often wears a hat. I have known them for many years and have always found them to be exuberantly cheerful, welcoming, and enthusiastic. Their language is colorful, dramatic, vibrant, often almost poetic, and our conversation was frequently interrupted by joyous laughter. While we talked I found myself wishing I could supplement this article with a video of our conversation. They clearly respect and enjoy each other enormously, listening intently while the other one speaks, often chiming in with affectionate, generous praise or agreement. When I start by asking them to tell me about their childhood and families, Paul says, \" Why don't you kick it off, dear one?\" and Annie does \u2014 surprising me by beginning with Paul's story, rather than her own. \"Pauli was raised in Adrian, Michigan, and his family ran Lenawee Hills Greenhouse and Nursery.\" Born in 1955, Paul was the sixth of seven children. \"The seven children were always a hope, I think, to their parents to continue the business,\" continues Annie, \"And the seven children, as fast and far away as they could go, moved. So, none of them took over the business.\" Nevertheless, Paul was surrounded by plants and by growing things throughout his childhood. While he was still a young boy, his mother suffered a heart attack that weakened her, and Paul became her main support. \"It was a lovely thing,\" says Annie, \"I think mutually. She really enjoyed having Paul as her helper, and he learned very loving, tender, domestic things from her.\" The End of an Era in Ann Arbor's Organic Farming and Food Culture Ann Arbor's Most Beloved Countercultural Couple, Annie Elder and Paul Bantle, Prepare to Pass on Their Stewardship of The Community Farm Their language is colorful, dramatic, vibrant, often almost poetic, and our conversation was frequently interrupted by joyous laughter. \"I walked into the Bakery and this woman comes bounding up to the goodie case, with a gorgeous smile and just radiant! I bought a goodie and I thought, 'Wow, this woman is something else!'\" By Sandor SlomovitsPhotography by Fresh Coast PhotographyThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 57 actually were in Ann Arbor together before that because I was in school here from '73 to '78,\" says Paul. \"We could have been in Mr. Flood's Party at the same time!\" adds Annie dramatically, referencing a favorite 1970s downtown music bar and hangout. Paul goes on: I got back to this country, and the only thing I knew was I needed to go to the People's Food Co-op, because I knew there would be like-minded people there. And lo and behold there is the Bakery right next door to the Co-op. I walked into the Bakery and this woman comes bounding up to the goodie case, with a gorgeous smile and just radiant! I bought a goodie and I thought, 'Wow, this woman is something else!' This was fall, winter was coming, she had boots on, and I said to her, 'Winter is coming and I don't have the proper footwear. What would you recommend?' And she told me that I should get some Sorrels. And I said, 'OK' and that's what I went and bought, and indeed that was a very good choice. (Laughter.) Not to mention the goodie was pretty good too. (More laughter.) \"So Paul came into the Bakery and he would volunteer,\" continues Annie. \"Always on her shift,\" interrupts Paul, and Annie giggles. \"He was a wonderful, wonderful volunteer, always clear, always kind, very thorough, willing to do anything all the time, just the ideal worker. I just could feel there was something pretty special about that fellow. And the more I worked with him the more apparent that was.\" Paul gradually went from volunteering to working at the Bakery. \"He continued to just be amazing. He's very skilled at peacemaking, being very, very fair. Paul was always just this wise, kind person, helping work out all the conflicts that would come along, and celebrating. So, of course, he was the fond guy of many of the gals that worked in the Bakery.\" \"Oh really!\" asks Paul. says Annie emphatically.\"You didn't tell me back then!\"\"Well.\" (Laughter.)\"Could have changed the course of life,\" says Paul, laughing. \"No, I think it worked out good, didn't it?\" \"So in the end, we decided that we would come together,\" says Annie. \"Slowly we unveiled our fondness for each other.\"\"It was rough sometimes, too,\" says Paul.\"Yes,\" agrees Annie. \"The beginning was very rough.\"Paul explains: She was a single mother with Mahogany when I came onto the scene. As a young fellow travelling, I had daily rhythms, I always woke with the sun and went to bed with the sun, I was pretty regular that way. But to come into a home and learn from Annie how to be in a home and be with a child growing up was a wonderful undertaking. And she was much better equipped in that regard than I was. So I learned a lot. You've got one girl in the family, Mahogany, who is still very in love and attached to her father, and you've got this kind of interloper coming in. That takes a lot of years to settle into a loving family. It took five years of working together in a collective setting, the Bakery. It was a great training ground for a long-term relationship, for making a household. Finally, on a family camping trip in Washington State, they hiked up a mountain and found a hot spring. \"There's nobody around,\" says Annie, \"So, of course, without our clothes, we sat in the tub, talked about life and love and commitment, decided that we would be monogamous, and kind, and loving to each other, and serve our community together. That was the full moon of August 1989, and we consider that our wedding.\" \"That was essentially our vows,\" says Paul, \"That our relationship would be grounded in being of good service in our community. There were clearly other aspects to it that were very passionate and moving through all the years, but I think that's what we've returned to over and over again.\" Annie and Paul became farmers after Cindy Olivas, one of the bakers at Wildflour, along with her partner, Marcia Barton, helped found the Community Farm of Ann Arbor. Olivas and Barton had studied biodynamic farming in Kimberton, Pennsylvania, and brought Trauger Groh to Ann Arbor to talk about CSAs (Community Supported Agriculture). Groh, a German farmer steeped in the biodynamic agriculture ideas of Rudolf Steiner, helped bring those ideas and practices to the United States in the mid-1980s. Olivas and Barton began running the Community Farm in 1988, and in 1991 they asked Annie and Paul to take over for them. Annie and Paul had long been associated with Ken and Cathy King at Frog Holler Farm, Paul having worked there as early as 1978. \"They were like mentors to us,\" says Annie. In the spring of 1992 they became the head farmers at the Community Farm. \"In our 25 years on this farm, we've watched children be born, grow up on this food, and then come back as workers. We've been so intimate with so many people for so long.\" And now they are planning to move on. The whole time they have been farming, and even for several years before, they have been practicing a form of meditation called Passage Meditation. In 2018, they plan to move to Northern California, to Tomales. There, on the coast in Marin County, is a residential community of people \"Our family encouraged us to not even think about color. We had three heroes that my parents taught us: Gandhi, Jesus Christ, and Martin Luther King. \" -Annie Elder \"I got back to this country, and the only thing I knew was I needed to go to the People's Food Co-op, because I knew there would be like- minded people there. \" -Paul Bantle Continued on page 58 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 58 who have also been practicing Passage Meditation, and is where the organization's headquarters and retreat center are located. \"We both already have roles that are quite nice, and we can be occupied there on a full-time basis,\" says Paul. He has been leading meditation retreats throughout the country for years and will continue to do that there, while Annie will help with preparing food, taking care of some of the elders of the community, and gardening. But, Paul hastens to add, \"It's a garden, not a four acre farm.\" **** Annie: Something that I really aspire to do, in the words of Dick Siegel, [popular Ann Arbor songwriter] is to 'walk a little softer on this earth.' I feel we've done really good. We're conscious of our carbon footprint and we're trying to bring as much local agriculture to our area [as we can] and raise consciousness in that area, but I still think there's something more I can do. The changes that I feel we need to make, and I need to make, are changes in ourselves, in myself. And those are changes like becoming less self-oriented and really putting others first in all of my choices: not only people, but also the planet, in everything I do. Also, really slowing down. I don't drive a car but I can still slow down my mind. I think that's really important. [These are among some of the basic tenets of the Passage Meditation path that Annie and Paul practice.] I always hope that what I do can somehow inspire others to do. That's what I'm hoping for from me in this move. Paul: We're trying to find that next stage of inner growth. It's not that we couldn't find it here too. This is a beautiful context for that. The whole biodynamic agricultural stream is founded on spiritual discipline. Rudolf Steiner suggested to the farmers in his agricultural lectures that they become meditators, and so we were really fortunate to be able to meld this path with the biodynamic farming pursuit. But now we're at this threshold where I think if we kept going in the fashion that we've been going, we would be exploiting our bodies. We've already probably taken it over the edge on that (laughter), and it's our instrument for our spiritual development, and for our service. We have a lot of service left in us. And if we just use that body up without paying attention, it's not a smart way to go. This offers us another opportunity. But they're finding it difficult to find people to take over for them \u2014 for a variety of complex reasons. The Farm was only the eighth CSA in the U.S. and the first in Michigan, but the movement has grown tremendously since those early days in the mid-1980s. There are now thousands of CSAs throughout the country and they have morphed and changed in many ways over the years, but the Community Farm is still run in the original CSA form. The members own all the assets of the farm \u2014 the cow, the equipment, the land \u2014 and the farmers do not own anything. They have no personal equity in it. Paul: We're still out of that classical mold, and it's made it difficult in some ways for us to survive in the modern day context, because all these other CSAs offer a kind of convenience that makes them very attractive. We kind of have to hustle a lot, and educate, and show people why they would want to be a part of this. The other thing is, almost thirty years have passed since the founding of the Farm and we're confronting new issues, new obstacles. One of the things about the whole CSA movement in the beginning was that family farms were failing because the next generation didn't want to take it up. They were going to universities, to urban areas; CSAs were going to be the ready-made vehicles for handing it off. Well, here we are, we're aged farmers, now it's the test of the experiment. And I think there must be other farms in the country that are the same age group, that are confronting the same thing. One of the earlier issues was land tenure: how these farms were going to secure the land they were farming. Many of them had to address that, and many of them did it through land trusts, and many of them established non-profit educational arms, like we have. But now it's the people issue. What do you do with aging farmers, who can't crawl around on the ground as easily, but the pension outlook isn't like a corporate outlook.The End of an Era in Ann Arbor's Organic Farming and Food Culture Continued from page 57 \"So, of course, without our clothes, we sat in the tub, talked about life and love and commitment, decided that we would be monogamous, and kind, and loving to each other, and serve our community together. That was the full moon of August 1989, and we consider that our wedding. \" \"In our 25 years on this farm, we've watched children be born, grow up on this food, and then come back as workers. We've been so intimate with so many people for so long. \" -Annie Elder The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 59 Annie: Our situation is tricky because if we were traditional farmers and we owned our land and assets and we had children that didn't want to take it up, we'd sell those and that would be our pension. But we don't own the land, the equipment, we don't have a pension. Paul: We've got to find this new clan of farmers. We've got this organism that's been so driven by this centralized passion and work ethic. How are we going to find the right people, and find an economy that supports them, and keep the vitality of the organization going? Annie: That's our conundrum. We're looking for people to take our place but not to do what we do. And that's partly why we have to leave, because the farm has to also shift. What it has been doing for 28 years so beautifully doesn't really fit society right now. Society has changed in all this time. So the farm has to take on maybe a new look, make some changes. But we are old school, and the ideas that we keep thinking are sort of new really aren't; they're still that same form, so if we step out our hope is that new blood, new ideas, new youth will come in to take our place and that will keep the farm going. Paul: We keep knitting it together through our will forces, which are strong. The food's good, the way of life is good, and our passion is good. So we can keep figuring out ways to thread the economy together to support it and we're frugal in our own personal life, but that's not a construct that will carry the farm forward. It's too oriented around us at the center, pulling all those threads. And we're getting worn out doing that. It's not sustainable for us either. Annie: For me...you get to be outside, and smell the air, and watch the sun and the clouds. You get to watch the plants grow, you get to tend the animals, you get to see these children grow more healthy because they're eating this food. Wow! Anyone would want this job! [Her voice drops to a whisper.] We're not finding that. When we first started farming, we hired co-workers. Some were our age, but a lot of them were a little younger. Then, after a few years, as we were hiring the same age people, we realized, 'Wow, we're as old as their parents!' And now, in the last couple of years, we've realized we're as old as their grandparents! (Laughter.) It's so wild. Paul: The fun thing is we get along really well with them. It just feels like we're not that different. We know we're different from them, but we don't feel that different too. They keep us vibrant and vital. Their pay, relative to what other young people are making at entry-level jobs, they are not making money. So they come to it for the sake of what it is. They're passionate. But it's another level then to take on the totality of running it [the farm] and being with the animals day in and day out. We've heard this from many young people now; I think they've watched their parents and grandparents do what we've done, and they don't want to give their all to one thing. They want a more balanced lifestyle. They want to be able to have time to go to the lake and canoe and swim, explore friendships. I think there was a period, maybe in the '60s and '70s \u2014 and I'm guessing this \u2014 people got so passionate, almost driven, about the causes they were engaged in, that that's where they principally got nourished. My sense is this generation has watched that and they want to be nourished in lots of different ways. So it might take a combination of people to run it. I think it could take years for this transformation to get to a good solid position. **** Another of the issues facing the Community Farm's transition is its structure, where the farmers, members, and board of directors need to work together on decisions affecting the farm. Paul and Annie have decades of experience in leading and working in collective communities, first through their work at Wildflour Bakery and then in their years on the Farm, helping to lead in a manner that manages to include and involve everyone in a diverse group of people. They speculate that whoever takes over after them will need to be a leader who has, as Paul says, That ability to include all different kinds of people. This is why we thought that if a core group [of the members of the Farm] meets, and it's small \u2014 because many people have been with the Farm for twenty years or more, and they're not interested in coming to meetings any more so much \u2014 they won't be represented in that process necessarily very strongly, unless the people that are present there recognize there is all these different types of people, and figure out how to draw them out and really represent their perspectives in evolving the farm forward. That's a big thing. It's consensus-based, not simple majority rule. Some people have come from the inside out, they've worked with us and they've got all the other stuff going on, but then they get into these meetings and they go... \"Something that I really aspire to do, in the words of Dick Siegel, [popular Ann Arbor songwriter] is to 'walk a little softer on this earth.

Nope, you've got to check with the whole membership and they have to agree before you make that change. It's a hard thing for people.\" Paul: So even that may have to adjust itself somehow. Annie: The farm needs to shift to be sustainable. And if we're here, without meaning to, we could stop that shift. Paul: We occupy a lot of space. (Laughter.) It's hard for us not to. It's a great dance to learn to recede into the woodwork a bit to create the proper space and vacuum for others to enter into, but also to be present to support that process and use your intelligence that you've developed over time, because they're calling for that too. We're learning a lot about detachment in this process, but we also have a responsibility to the cow and the animals \u2014 they're living beings that are counting on us. We make sure they're taken care of. Annie: This farm uses biodynamic agriculture; it really tries to incorporate the spirit of the earth itself as our mother, and the spirit of the sky above, the cosmos and all those forces, all those influences. The people that dwell on the farm, the people that work it on the earth and the cosmos, it all comes together with love. Whatever comes into the future of the farm, love will be its center, like it has been for all these years. Paul: Down through the ages, brilliant beings that have come and gone, including Rudolf Steiner, they're all trying to help us see that there's an unseen world, they're helping us get a glimpse of an unseen world that they can see. This farm is predicated on that whole journey of seeing more and more of the unseen and developing a relationship to it and trusting it and listening to it. It's a living being, it's a spiritual entity now and radiates all around and threads into our community of creatures and plant life and people. It really is much more than its material incarnation, its physical body. And that's interesting at this time because the attachment part of me says, 'Don't let that go.' There's a part of me that just wants to hold on to this form and have it last forever. And then there's the detached part that I'm trying to learn about that says there's an impulse here that's way more vast than I know about, and it's love \u2014 it's what Annie said about love \u2014 and I don't get to say how that's going to take its new form. Annie: This community, the life that we overlap with here, has filled my being, my heart, and my soul. It's in my dreams, and to let it go is a lot like dying to me. We're so, so lucky because we have a spiritual practice. Thanks to our practice and to Paul, who's often been taken by this subject, I have been able to embrace death in a much easier way. With tears filling her eyes, Annie says, \"We'll miss this place.\" **** I checked in with Paul and Annie again in mid-February to ask how things were progressing with the transition. I had gone to a membership meeting in December and then also heard at several other meetings in the last few months that the Farm's membership had gotten clearer on the qualifications for Annie and Paul's replacement(s). Annie confirmed this, We've restarted the search and we've got a number of beautiful applicants. They're young, they're green, they're new at it, but they have enthusiasm and creativity, and I think what's going to happen is just what we need to have happen. The farm will turn over to a stream of young, vibrant health. We then continued to talk more about the unique qualities of the Farm.The End of an Era in Ann Arbor's Organic Farming and Food Culture Continued from page 59 \"That's our conundrum.

In the last few years, as we've been on the farm longer and longer, that's what we've recognized it to be. You know in the early 1900s, or maybe the late 1800s, there were a lot of farms that were essentially hospitals. They closed many of them down, they turned them into other things. People that were quite ill or mentally imbalanced, however one says that, would go to these farms that served as therapeutic centers. Then I don't know what happened, but they evolved away from that. I actually think that that's what's going on now, not just with our farm, but with farms all over this country and all over the world, at really healthy farms people are coming to get healed. I think in this age, where the world is in such a tumult, that at these farms people feel safe and secure, they quiet down. Many people over the years have come from other countries, and they're often very in touch in some way or another, they're brilliant beings in their own fields, and they come to our farm and they bless the farm with their presence. A healer from the Andes came, a plum farmer from France, and this whole contingent from China. This last year a Filipino woman that wants to start collective farms in the south of the Philippines, and a woman from India who is doing... Annie: Healing the earth from the Tsunami damage. She came. Paul: Every year these people come. And they're thrilled with the farm, but they're brilliant beings and there's something about their presence on the farm that takes it to a different place. It's that kind of exchange that's happened over all those years, I think, that's saturated the spirit of the farm. Annie: Education is an essential element of our farm and it starts with the members educating and sharing with each other, what to do with the vegetables, et cetera, so there's a lot of communication that goes on within our membership because they come to the farm to get vegetables. That's where our education starts. Paul: That's really probably our biggest offering in the community: on-farm experience for young people. I know that there are other farms that are oriented in that direction, but I think we've got a very well-developed program. I recalled that I had brought my daughter here for a whole weekend some years back when her whole class from the Steiner School spent the weekend camping on the farm, participating in the farm's activities. It was a wonderful experience, one we still talk about.The End of an Era in Ann Arbor's Organic Farming and Food Culture Continued from page 61 Annie: We have field trips that go from third grade up to U-M students that come out to the Farm. Our Farm doesn't have any secrets. We are totally legal, totally aboveboard, totally open to anybody. So if people come and inquire, we share with them, because we want people to do good on the earth. If we have something that could help them, we want to share it with them. So people have come, even from other countries to learn from our Farm. We welcome that. We love that. Competition is tricky but we don't let that rule us. Really what's important is that we look at the world all together. Paul: Over the years we've always shared our planting calendars, our planting rhythms, all our seeds, seed sources, our bookkeeping, all our books are totally open to whoever would like to look at them. We've shared how someone new to the world of CSAs could form and operate their own CSA. Annie: Sometimes when people ask, \"What is the most special thing we grow?\" We really do come back to love.I ask Paul and Annie if they grow love. \"We do, we really do,\" replies Annie as she giggles with delight. I suggest to Annie and Paul that that may be what is drawing all those people here, those who want to offer something, as well as those in need of healing, maybe even whether or not they know it. Building on this, Annie explains: The essence of biodynamic agriculture, which is the farming practice that we use, recognizes that the earth is a living, breathing being and that we need to be gentle to her and help heal her and give gratitude when she supplies us with this wonderful food. That's been an important part of our farming practice and I think people can feel that even without talking to us. Paul responds, \"Yes, it just goes around and around and around.\" (He chuckles with delight.)

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 63 We are a community of meditators. In the last Crazy Wisdom Community Journal there were listings for 25 different organizations offering meditation. Many more people practice as part of church, temple, or mosque prayer time. Some meditations are specific to cultural or religious traditions, while others do not require membership to participate. Mindfulness is now a trending topic, prompting articles, videos, social media threads, and books to be available. The Ann Arbor community has been at the forefront of embracing such trends for the past 45 years. To get some local history about the slow and steady rise in Ann Arbor's interest in meditation, as well as a sense of what it means to be a longtime meditator, I spoke with Elizabeth (Libby) Robinson, part of the Ann Arbor Center for Mindfulness. Libby, a retired researcher from the University of Michigan, has been living in Ann Arbor since 1970, leaving only to teach at Buffalo and Case Western in the early 1990's. After retirement, she and her husband moved from their longtime home on White Street to the West Park area. I was able to catch Libby for an interview at the new Westgate branch of the Ann Arbor District Library, where we conversed in the large exhibit room while visitors perused the art. Being in Place \u2014 A Panorama of Meditation in Ann Arbor as told by Libby Robinson Interview begins on page 64Interview by Kirsten Mowrey Photographs by Joni Strickfaden \"[Mindfulness is] more of a clearing out. I think it allows us to clear out the barriers to effective action, the barriers within ourselves.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 64 Kirsten Mowrey: Libby, thank you for speaking with me. How did you get started in mindfulness meditation? Libby Robinson: You're welcome. I was in my mid 30's and really wanted to learn meditation because I was pretty troubled emotionally and not in touch with what I really wanted to do and how I felt about things. I certainly had zip piece of mind, or very little. I tried to learn meditation through a book \u2014 that didn't work very well. I tried to learn it by hanging out with some of the groups in Ann Arbor that I knew about, but they were very guru focused. I just wasn't comfortable with a guru, the stories I heard about gurus; they felt very cultish to me. Kirsten Mowrey: So your mid-30's would have been the late 80's?Libby Robinson: No, late 70's (laughs). Kirsten Mowrey: When you say gurus, you mean like Ram Dass or Osho? Libby Robinson: Not Ram Dass, though his book was really helpful because that's where I found out there are lots of different kinds of meditation, not just one type. That was helpful for me \u2014 oooh there are lots of different ways of doing this. The Meditators Guidebook, I think is the name of it, I really recommend it ( Journey of Awakening: A Meditator's Guidebook, Bantam, 1981). My brother was at the Insight Meditation Society (IMS) in Barre, Massachusetts, at that time. He was there for a three-month retreat and after that he got hired as a staff member. I learned about IMS and a little bit about the kind of meditation they taught, the people, and the teachers \u2014 they were called teachers, they weren't the guru who must be obeyed at all costs or whatever, so I thought, OK, go check it out. So I signed up for a one-week silent retreat. KM: For your first one?LR: First one ever, right? Right, and it was scary and wonderful and I didn't like the teacher and I broke silence by calling my husband and having an argument with him. When I told my teacher, she wasn't supportive because I'd kind of created this situation myself. But I learned so much about my mind. About these \u2014 mental traps, cognitive traps, stories \u2014 that we get caught up in. And one of my big insights \u2014 that's why it's called insight \u2014 was how these emotional states will come and then they are gone and you can have a totally different mind state. Becoming aware of how temporary our mind states are, unless of course we hold onto them and define our inner selves by them. Ruth Denison \u2014 she was my first teacher, she's a real character. I got home and started meditating 45 minutes a day and went to another retreat a year later and have been going to retreats every year or two ever since. Insight Meditation is also called mindfulness or Vipassana and what I was learning was American Vipassana and that's what I've practiced ever since. Initially I couldn't find anybody in Ann Arbor who did it and I was just by myself. KM: So from nothing, then daily meditating for 45 minutes?LR: For about five years, pretty solidly. In 1984, I started the M.S.W. and Ph.D. program here at U-M. It was while I was working on my dissertation that my practice went through a hiatus, shall we say. It was hard, because I would, over the years, keep trying to connect with other people. I would find out there were groups of other people sitting in this tradition and this approach but they weren't open groups and they weren't taking in any new people. So I was still just sitting on my own. I'm sure that affected my practice. It would have helped to have been part of a group. KM: Local groups such as Deep Spring and Insight Meditation Ann Arbor, are those groups open? LR: Those groups are open now. We have a bunch of groups that are open; there are drop-ins all over the place now. KM: When did you start to see that changing in Ann Arbor? LR: Good question. Probably in the mid 80's, I think. I met Barbara Brodsky at a retreat. She and I and a couple other people started a group and then I dropped out, but that's the group that went on to become Deep Spring. When I got my Ph.D., I took a job on the faculty of SUNY Buffalo. I continued to meditate, continued to go to retreats. KM: So your practice became regular again?LR: Yes, a bump and then reestablish. There have been periods all along, these 37 years, of not doing much meditation, daily meditation, and then getting back into it, rededicating myself to it.Being in Place \u2014 A Panorama of Meditation in Ann Arbor as told by Libby Robinson Interview by Kirsten Mowrey Photographs by Joni Strickfaden \"I tried to learn it by hanging out with some of the groups in Ann Arbor that I knew about, but they were very guru focused.\" \"And one of my big insights [was]... Becoming aware of how temporary our mind states are, unless of course we hold onto them and define our inner selves by them.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 65 KM: 37 years is a long relationship! LR: That's true.KM: What has it taught you? Especially with coming and going.LR: Oh so much. The more you do it, not just the more insights you have, the more you can cultivate that sense of peacefulness and compassion. I really appreciate, over the years, how important cultivating compassion and non-judgment is, because I'm very hard on myself and very judgmental. That's a mental habit that had been established even before I got into meditation, and when those thoughts come up, I don't take them as seriously. I'm more likely to say, \"Oh, there's that thought again, that I'm not good enough, or that nobody likes me,\" or whatever, and knowing that it's not necessarily true and that if I wait, it will probably disappear. That persistent thought will disappear. KM: Arises, blossoms, and fades. LR: Right, right, not holding onto it and not allowing it to define who you are, who I am. \"Oh, there's that thought,\" and maybe it's not a thought about you, maybe it's a thought about other people. I like to tell the story in my classes, at my first retreat, I was standing behind somebody in line to get tea, and she was making her tea in front of me and she was doing it wrong (chuckles). And I was going through this whole thing in my head about how she was doing it wrong and she must not understand about tea and when the retreat was over I was going to tell her how to do her tea right. And I suddenly noticed \u2014 mindfulness is all about noticing \u2014 what I was doing and laughed at myself. I mean, I was embarrassed too, I think, but laughed at this ridiculous judgment that was going on in my head. A lot of it is letting go, letting go of judgment. KM: When did you make the transition to teaching?LR: In the early 2000s, I was working here at U-M in the Psychiatry Department as a research fellow and I'd gotten a National Institutes of Health grant. My research was about whether or not spiritual and religious change plays a role in people recovering from alcohol. That's what I was funded to investigate; it was just a longitudinal survey. John Greden, the head of the department, met with me and he thought I should do an intervention, a spiritual/religious intervention (as part of the study). I said \" Ack! Well, the only one I could think that I would be comfortable doing, because I'm definitely not into proselytizing \u2014 was teaching meditation.\" He said, \"Do you know about mindfulness based cognitive therapy and depression by Segal and Teasdale? Why don't you try that?\" The department paid for me to go off and I got trained in mindfulness based cognitive therapy, mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) and the teacher development intensive. In 2003, I started teaching. Initially it was a very casual thing. I started a class at Chelsea Arbor Treatment Center, which no longer exists, but which used to be an outpatient treatment center for people with addictions. I was a part-time clinician there and I taught it to some of the other folks I was working with. In 2007, I offered it to anybody in the department [of Psychiatry] and I taught it three times. Faculty, staff, fellows, anybody who worked there \u2014 and I offered the eight-week MBSR class. I learned a lot. I hope that everybody who took it got something out of it. I know that some of the people who took it went on and are part of the Ann Arbor Center for Mindfulness. I don't know that it was their first exposure. I'd keep trying to find other people who taught mindfulness [in the area]. KM: At this point Deep Spring existed? LR: Yes, Deep Spring existed at this point and I would go there sometimes on their Sunday morning sits. KM: You've been teaching now in a university setting and private setting.LR: And community. I started teaching in the community to anybody who wanted to in 2010. I rented space at the Lotus Center, they have a nice classroom space there, and I've been teaching three to six classes a year ever since. KM: As you've come into teaching in different communities, what do you value in a teacher? Ruth, your first teacher, you didn't like. LR: Well, that was my stuff.KM: Right, your first introduction. Maureen McMahon: Paulette, you have a long history of teaching Humanities at Washtenaw Community College (WCC) and you trained at U-Mass Medical School Integrative Medicine Center for Mindfulness. Now your teaching has shifted to meditation. How did you begin to learn meditation and what were some highlights of your training? What was it like? Paulette Grotrian: My first experience with meditation was in the 1990's with Transcendental Meditation. In early 2000, I met a teacher who taught Mindfulness, Martha Kimball, who is in Ann Arbor and is retired now. I studied with her for quite a few years. In 2010, she suggested I become a Mindfulness teacher. That took me by surprise, but she said, \"You get it. You have something to share.\" I began my mindfulness teacher training at Omega Institute, where Jon Kabat-Zinn, the founder of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), was my teacher; I went on to study in his program at University of Massachusetts Medical School, and after silent retreats at Spirit Rock in California, much coursework, and Intensives, I became a qualified MBSR teacher. I have been teaching in the Ann Arbor area ever since. For me, it has been a personally and professionally rewarding journey. MM: Is there an Ann Arbor Center for Mindfulness initiative you are most excited about? What is your current focus with teaching and facilitating Mindfulness? Who's attending? PG: A group of us started the Center for Mindfulness in 2015. We Mindfulness teachers and practitioners found strength in collaboration, that we can support each other, and that we have much more to offer the community as a resource. This year we added Teacher Support Meetings for those who use Mindfulness in their professions, and this has increased our personal and collective effectiveness. As for my current teaching, in 2016 I trained to be a Mindful Self- Compassion (MSC) teacher and will be teaching that course again in the fall in Saline, along with a MBSR course in Ann Arbor. This June, I'm excited to teach a five-day MBSR Intensive, June 21-25, 9:30-3:30 p.m. at the Naturopathic School of Healing Arts in Ann Arbor. This will be the first time the Intensive has been offered in the Ann Arbor area. It is designed for those who would find it hard to take the 8-week course. Also, it is ideal for teachers. Registration is open on my website. Additionally, I host a weekly drop-in meditation called Open Meditation Saline on Tuesday mornings. As for who attends, MBSR and MSC are really for everybody. Participants include those with health challenges; some dealing with loss and grief; folks dealing with anxiety or feeling overwhelmed, including university students; married couples interested in learning mindfulness together for a healthier relationship; and those newly retired. MM: What are some groups or partnerships you are excited about working with to teach MBSR? PG: One exciting development is at WCC, I taught an MBSR course to Campus Services in the Facilities Management Division and I've done some work with faculty through Professional Development. WCC Facilities Management leadership is strongly considering the training for their managers and eventually for the whole division. In short, there is a desire to build the principles of MBSR into the fabric of the workplace. MM: Sounds like it can change the place from the inside out. Thank you, Paulette.

Questions for Paulette Grotrian, Co-Founder of Ann Arbor Center for Mindfulness \"...what I was learning was American Vipassana and that's what I've practiced ever since. Initially I couldn't find anybody in Ann Arbor who did it and I was just by myself.\" \"The more you do it, not just the more insights you have, the more you can cultivate that sense of peacefulness and compassion.\" Continued on page 66The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 66 LR: I think a mindfulness teacher, first and foremost, has to have a strong personal mindfulness practice. A pretty solid experience with meditation using mindfulness approaches. For a while, not just six months or one class, and retreat experiences need to be part of that: going to week-long silent retreats really cracks that open and lets you see your own mind traps that you get into and softens them. Which is an essential part of what we are trying to convey to other people, and I think you need your own personal grounding in that. If you are teaching one of these mindfulness based interventions, you need to get trained in that, whether it's mindfulness based cognitive therapy of depression, or the granddaddy of them all, MBSR, or one of the newer ones that's out there now. Some of them have nice, well written up curriculums that you can find in books, but there's nothing like going to a training and getting to work with someone \u2014 advanced trainings too if you can. Susan Woods does a lot of trainings, [and] there's an open ended discussion at the end of a meditation about what people have experienced, what they noticed and how does that relate to their well-being. The training is really important and then teaching: How much teaching has this person done? Is this their first class? I'm so different from that first class I taught; I think back now on that and I go (makes a face) \"ewehh.\" You know, so, the more you teach, the more solid your understanding gets about how to convey this approach, which is so different from how we typically go in the world. Mindfulness isn't for everybody and every mindfulness teacher is going to be different and it's worth checking out \u2014 Is this somebody that I can learn from? Even my first teacher, whom I didn't like, I learned so much from her. And that is more important than I felt irritated with her and felt she put me down \u2014 that's my crap. I learned so much from her, so that's the question: What do you learn about your mind? Are you more liberated from your mental traps when you do these things, when you practice this way? When you learn from this teacher? When you read Jack Kornfield's books or Sharon Salzberg's books or listen to one of her recorded podcasts or guided meditations. That's not a bad place to start: listen to Jon Kabat-Zinn on the web or Jack Kornfield or Sharon Salzberg. They are wonderful teachers. That's your practice, for five minutes a day you listen to one of them. All my original teachers, my Vipassana teachers, are Buddhists. What they are teaching are the teachings of the Buddha: the dharma, the sangha. Whereas, these mindfulness based interventions are secular. There's actually this whole interesting conversation going on within the Buddhist community: Can you have Buddhism without Buddha? Secular Buddhism. There are some people in the Buddhist community who see the mindfulness movement as antithetical: \"They aren't teaching ethics, they aren't teaching compassion.\" I do, it's more subtle than \"thou shalt not\"; it's more what cultivates compassion and friendliness and how do we do that and strategies for doing that. To me, it's never been about beliefs, whether you are Vipassana or not, it's about the practice and you don't have to believe Buddha even existed, you don't have to believe in karma or reincarnation or any of that kind of stuff. It's not about beliefs; it's not about ritual. There are other branches of Buddhism that are much more focused around ritual and beliefs. But Mindfulness and Insight Meditation and Vipassana, they are all kissing cousins. KM: I'm curious about origins of the Ann Arbor Center for Mindfulness. LR: Initially we started out as a teacher support group. I was desperate to have some support for teaching from other people who were teaching. It was me, Lynn Sipher, and Julie Woodward got together once a month and talked about teaching. We started attracting people who were psychotherapists and then somebody had the bright idea, \"Well, let's have an event. Let's bring in...\" I forget. We started having these events, [and] organizing these events. We realized we needed to organize ourselves. Gradually, it got bigger. It kinda got too big. We're down to about ten people who are really committed to working on creating an organization that fosters mindfulness and fosters the cultivation of mindfulness. What the group is about now \u2014 besides getting ourselves organized \u2014 we still have a monthly teacher support group and we do presentations now, on the self, compassion, or mindful yoga. [We want to] broaden it out and invite people to join us. We're becoming a nonprofit, I think we'll be a membership based nonprofit, that provides quality teaching and mindfulness strategies, to the public, specific populations, the medical school, or a business if they want it. KM: How did you come to teach in Flint in February of 2016?LR: I was approached by somebody from U-M Flint who had gotten a grant and she heard from Jesse Jackson at Institute of Social Research that I taught mindfulness. The first people she'd approached didn't work out. I was happy to do it, to go up there and teach MBSR. The population that they were focusing on were people who had somebody in the family who was incarcerated. We taught two classes (MBSR class format is weekly for eight weeks). I brought in another teacher, which I'm really glad I did. Patrice (Trice) Berlinski, who lives in Fenton, she'd had some experience and most of her experience was teaching to kids. Which was really great, because some of the people brought their kids, their little kids. KM: The study was open to any family member?LR: It was supposed to be adults, but you know how it is, you might not have the funds or access to someone who can babysit the kids, so what are you going to do \u2014 make sure they don't get into trouble. It was kind of interesting, we had kids 8, 10, 12 [years old] who were in the group and Trice was great at using analogies and metaphors that helped them kind of grab \u2014 understand what we were talking about. KM: So you kept to the format, and still did the class as a big group?LR: In the second group, there were kids. [We had] two classes, one on Thursday nights and one on Tuesday nights. Ahh, it was intense. We were teaching this in the midst of the water crisis, and that was a dominant stressor for everybody. That was actually a bigger stressor in many ways than having a family member who was incarcerated. KM: Did people mention it as a stressor? LR: They always talked about it all the time, at many classes the issue of the water came up. LR: How did you & Trice address it, if you did?LR: We talked about it. It was part of what people were experiencing at that point. How do you \u2014 you know, mindfulness isn't just about putting up with stuff that is annoying or disheartening, or where you're being abused, it's also about, \"This is going on. This is not good for me. How can I strategize around how best to work with this?\" They were all very involved, in the public meetings, a really interesting bunch of people and doing what they could about it, using bottled water. I remember someone else in a class once asked me, \"OK, so we work with anger in this way?\" We're not trying to pretend the anger isn't there or that injustice isn't there, but more like, How can I best respond to this situation? And for some people, because of all the other things going on in their lives, they are doing the best they can to get one foot in front of the next and make sure there's clean water and food in the house and things like that. [Mindfulness is] more of a clearing out. I think it allows us to clear out the barriers to effective action, the barriers within ourselves. You know, if I am so angry that every time I see officials I blow up at them, that's not going to be as effective as if I can come up with a response that allows me to connect with them and [I'm] more likely to come up with a creative solution to the situation if I'm not caught in my own reactivity about something. KM: How was the class received by the participants?LR: It's like any class; it's a mixed bag. You know, some people got a lot out of it. This one woman was so proud \u2014 her blood pressure was dropping and it had been very high. Some people are like, \"What's this about?\" Everyone was very respectful and open, and it was obviously hard for people to [physically] get there. It's very different from a regular class because it's a research project; people were paid to be there. There was data collection on the first day and the last day people filled out questionnaires. Later, Trice and I, when we were talking about it, [realized] it would have been really helpful if one of us had been a person of color. I think that would have given some authenticity to it, for them. I think it was hard for people to see, \"Well, what does this have to do with my having a family member who is incarcerated?\" KM: Does the Flint experience relate to the Center of Mindfulness at all? LR: Not obviously, although I think broadening ourselves in terms of bringing in people of color and LGBT people. Making sure that we're not just a bunch of white middle class women, I think that's important and figuring out how to make that happen. KM: Who is your typical mindfulness student?LR: In Ann Arbor? KM: Or classes. \u2014 Libby Robinson \u2014 \"a lot of it is letting go, letting go of judgment.\"\"My research was about whether or not spiritual and religious change plays a role in people recovering from alcohol... and I got trained in mindfulness based cognitive therapy, mindfulness based stress reduction...\" \"In 2007, I offered it [Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction] to anybody in the department [of Psychiatry] and I taught it three times. Faculty, staff, fellows, anybody who worked there \u2014 and I offered the eight-week MBSR class...Continued from page 65The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 67 LR: I've had retired people in current classes. I've had graduate students. I've had people who are working, people who are disabled, people with lots of physical problems and physical pain. KM: Any people of color or LGBTQ people? LR: LGBTQ, yes, not that many people of color. KM: There was an article in the May/June 2016 Spirituality and Health magazine about meditation, suffering, communities of color, and meditation being more accessible. LR: Yeah, it does. People whose finances are stressed, whether black or white, are going to have a hard time coming up with four-hundred bucks for an eight-week class. They may not have health insurance that will cover it. KM: Is the financial the sole barrier?LR: No, I don't think that's the only barrier. I think another barrier is that it's a white people thing. I think another barrier is there's a lack of reaching out, of connecting with people of color on our parts. There's now a drop-in group in Ypsilanti, at the Michigan Avenue Library. It's still getting established; it's not well publicized. KM: Is that sponsored by the Ann Arbor Center for Mindfulness?LR: No, it's an offshoot of the Thursday night drop-in group that goes on at the Lotus Center. The Lotus Center Thursday night Ann Arbor open meditation is a drop-in group that is unrelated to Ann Arbor Center for Mindfulness. At this point in Ann Arbor it's the Wild Wild West. KM: There are many groups and you are with a couple of them. LR: Yes, there's Mindful Cities, which Lynne Sipher and others have started, where the focus is beyond mindfulness, social justice and other issues. KM: What do you think about apps that have you breathe?LR: Well, people may find those helpful. I've never tried them, so I really can't say. You know, it's all about \u2014 does it reduce suffering? Not like putting a band-aid on it, like having a drink or smoking some weed, but does it genuinely reduce suffering? Does it foster greater well-being and happiness? There's this emphasis on what is wholesome \u2014 the Buddhists would use the word skillful \u2014 what is a skillful response? If it works great, if it's a pain in the ass when it goes off, maybe you need a different strategy. Try something else. There's no hard and fast rule with this. A really busy working mother with three toddlers is going to have a hard time finding 15-20 minutes to meditate, so maybe just taking two minutes, after she drops off the kids for daycare, noticing the breath \u2014 not even manipulating the breath, not even going into the big deep breath, but just sitting there and noticing. Then putting the keys in the ignition and going on. Or spending time to really do one thing at a time for two minutes, those kind of informal kinds of mindfulness can be really helpful.

If we acknowledge that adults innately have intuitive abilities, then we must recognize that children also inherently have intuitive capabilities. Through their experiences, that intuition is either fostered or suppressed. It is common for highly intuitive children to sense events beyond the scope of their short life-experience. Some children may feel an overwhelming sense of anxiety or sadness when a catastrophe happens elsewhere in the world, without the child ever having knowledge of the event. Other children may be cognizant of events that happened long before their birth, without ever having learned that particular part of history. Additionally, children may even recall choosing their parents before they were born. Even highly recognized childhood staples such as \"imaginary\" friends indicate an underestimated and undervalued resource of intuitiveness among our youth. While it is perfectly common and acceptable for children to have imaginary friends, we must also look more deeply. A child may be spiritually gifted \u2014 communicating with a spirit guide, angel, or departed loved one \u2014 yet we may disregard their clairvoyance as \"imagination\" if we are not mindful. Children need to be able to trust themselves, know their strengths, and embrace their weaknesses, but this is only possible when parents show trust in their abilities. Encouraging them to follow their \"inner compass\" and listen to their gut is fundamental. Children's intuitive experiences should be respected as their truth and not discounted, distorted, or brushed off as imaginary or not \"real.\" If we support children's intuition, this highly developed inner compass will help steer them away from potential danger and around unnecessary problems throughout life. Anecdotes abound of individuals avoiding disasters due to a gut feeling, and there are just as many accounts of people ignoring their intuition, to their detriment. Intuition is a gift and should be treated as such. Within the metaphysical community, many people remember being an intuitive child, but their intuition was repressed by a society resistant to the unexplained. Some were repressed by religious organizations, others by their parents' beliefs. When these children approached their parents speaking of extrasensory phenomena, the parents often reacted with fear, judgment, or punishment. This parental reaction suppressed their children's natural connection to the \"World Beyond.\" The harmful effects of the pervasive sense of shame and \"wrongness\" that some of these intuitive children grew up with cannot be understated. Now, these children are adults and are trying to rediscover their gifts. Fortunately, we have the ability to further society's understanding and acceptance of intuition. We must commit to nurturing our children more wholly and openly than previous generations. Let's help our children not have to \"re-learn their gifts.\" Instead, let's help them embrace their intuition from the beginning. When we trust ourselves, are mindful, and listen to our inner compass, we live an authentic life. As spiritual actualization is a fundamental right of the intuitive child (and every person, for that matter), so is the experience of being around other authentic beings. Children need to see adults in their life live authentically, be mindful, and support those around them to do the same. As \"being present\" is the foundation of developing intuition, adults who are present themselves can have a more positive impact on their children's intuition. When we are present, we also notice more, and we are modeling both the path to engaging with our deepest selves and exploring our own innate intuition. This normalizing of authenticity and mindful presence is a protective agent against a society that puts enormous pressure on conformity, distraction, and external validation. In furthering the goal of fostering intuitive children, it is imperative that we support them in finding their passion and following it. If children are listening to their inner compass, their passion will lead them where they are supposed to go. If they are able to follow their passion from adolescence through adulthood, they can grow up knowing exactly who they are and what their life purpose is. This is a significant improvement to the current scenario where, as adults, we often hit a metaphorical wall in personal growth because we don't know who we truly are, nor how to trust ourselves and our intuition. Unfortunately, too many of us experience this barrier, and then realize late in our lives that we are not pursuing the passions that our spirits and hearts have been telling us to follow all along. If we want the world to reach toward a more enlightened place, we need to begin with the children. If children grow up in an enlightened, supportive, growth-centered, and affirming environment, they will not only be comfortable with themselves and have an appreciation of their intuitive gifts, they will also be uniquely prepared to show more tolerance and understanding of others. These children will be our leaders of tomorrow; let's help them be the best version of their selves. Christina DePugh is the Co-Owner of the Enlightened Soul Center in Ann Arbor and Co-Director of Intuitives Interactive's Holistic & Psychic Expo. She runs a monthly group for parents and kids ages 5-10 called the \"Intuitive and Sensitive Kids Gathering,\" which meets the fourth Monday of the month, 6:00-8:00 pm, for yoga and meditation; and once a month for a metaphysically minded activity.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 70 \"No matter what I do, you always find something wrong! I can't win!\" I can still hear my son hurtling this accusation my way when he was 12. He saw me as a constant nagger, always on him to do his homework or chores, turn off the computer, or get in the shower. Back then I worried that his lack of self-care and motivation surely foreshadowed a jobless, relationship-less existence with him living in my basement at 40. It was comments like the one above that helped me understand that while some of my guidance helped, the cost was a discouraged rather than energized child. If you've heard this comment from your child, you are not alone. The good news is that this observation is a gift. A hint from your child that you might not want to bank on that motivational speaking career. Of course, even if you already knew that, it doesn't tell you what to do instead. That's where Strength-Spotting comes in. Strength-Spotting is the practice of noticing and sharing examples of strengths (capabilities, talents, gifts, skills, abilities, assets) to give you perspective and a more balanced, hopeful, and whole picture of your child. It also allows you to slice larger skill sets into their component parts so that the effort doesn't seem as monumental and can help your child notice progress toward a goal, thus keeping motivation and engagement higher. What Parents Need to Master Strength-Spotting If Strength-Spotting sounds challenging, you're not alone. So before we discuss what you need to master this technique, let's spot one of your strengths to show some of its power. Just by reading this article your dedication to your parenting is shining through. And that is no small thing. Showing up and investing in finding ways to improve is essential to long-term success. Yes, more is needed, but engagement in learning\u2014whether it's you or your child\u2014is a crucial element. With that in mind, here's what you need to know to develop the skills of Strength-Spotting: Have Buy-in. It can seem counter-intuitive to focus on strengths when you feel a child has so far to go. The fear is often that pointing out a strength can demotivate a child from stepping up to the next challenge. And, this fear could have merit, but only if Strength-Spotting is what you mostly do. Noticing the positives is not meant to replace challenging your child to grow or holding them accountable. But helping your child see they are capable of improvement can give them more motivation to challenge themselves. Contain Your Fear, Impatience, or Discouragement. Especially when your child has really struggled, is discouraged and/or when their greatest strength seems to be in resistance to your guidance, parents can lose hope or grow impatient with their child's progress. On the other hand, a parent's own frustration or discouragement may be unintentionally contributing to this situation. Check if your expectations for how well and how quickly your child should progress are reasonable. Then, before trying to support your child, seek to rebuild your own hope and perspective. Some strategies for this include: Step back and take some time to observe your child from a more neutral place. Seeing your whole child, seeing them over time, seeing them outside of a particular problematic area. (Consider making a list to remind yourself of positive attributes and specific growth they have made.) Ask others to share the strengths they see in your child (relatives, teachers, coaches). Allow un-loaded consequences, such as having to do their chores before going out to play, to assist with teaching life lessons and help create motivation to learn. Tap others \u2014 family members/teachers/tutors/coaches \u2014 to directly support whatever skill you are trying to encourage. (Acknowledge possible burn-out.) Look beyond strength-attainment. Ask yourself: If my child never learned this life skill or task or any tangible life skills or tasks, would they be worthwhile anyway? (See \"A Gift From Alex\" in the sidebar.) Get coaching or support for your parenting. Just like children, parents do better with good support. Practice. Getting good at Strength-Spotting takes knowledge, time, and practice. The great news is that trying this technique can remind you of the parallel challenges that child may be facing and help you find some kindness and patience for both of you. The first strength to notice and note? Even trying something different is a strength! Techniques of Effective Strength-Spotting Before focusing on Strength-Spotting check the reasonableness of the expectation (think age, temperament, starting point, timeline for mastery). Then consider these techniques for mastering your use of Strength-Spotting: Watch the sarcasm, exaggerated surprise, or back-handed compliments at your child's improvement. Not: Wow! You actually got that one right! or It's about time! Try: I knew you would get it or Better now than never. (Because isn't it?) Avoid over-the-top praise or a shiny vision that doesn't jive with what your child believes and/or the evidence supports. (Oh, you're just the best artist I've ever seen.) Focus on effort or other attributes such as creativity, especially when there is improvement there. Wow, you did more than half of your homework without asking for help (or only a little help). Savor a success rather than immediately moving to the next challenge. Well, you learned your 5 times tables. Now you just have to learn your 6, 7, 8, and 9 times tables. Slice strengths thinner: Point out any and all strengths your child possesses that are building blocks of a bigger skill set. You've got A and you've got B. Now all you have to do is figure out C. Ask your child to lead the conversation. What strengths do they know they have already? What other strengths are needed? Where do they already possess some of these strengths? And if not in this area, maybe another? Notice how your comments land. If your child is rejecting your positive spin, stop pushing and check your delivery and timing. Give them a listening ear to acknowledge any fear or frustration. Let them grieve a disappointment rather than trying to quickly move past it. And if it's not going well, ask permission to offer a strength. (Can I tell you something good I see?) Follow up Strength-Spotting with reasonable challenges to continue progressing. Don't be afraid to point out positives and challenge them to grow. When challenging, remind them of the big-picture reasons for mastering skills and then focus on the next building block needed to continue progress. Where to Find Strengths to Spot Spot established strengths, small or emerging strengths, and strengths sandwiched between struggles. Look for improvements from previous attempts. (Compare them to themselves at an earlier time.) Point out glimpses of the person they are becoming. Notice strengths in values or foundational traits like honesty or personal accountability. (At least you...were honest.) Acknowledge any planning or improvements in organization, time Conscious Parenting By Annie Zirkel The Power of Strength-Spotting To Encourage Your Child \"No matter what I do, you always find something wrong!

Spot moments of grit, attention, resilience, creative work-arounds, or good humor. Note (though possibly share later) times when they have better stress-, anger-, or frustration-management. Spot strengths in any awareness of issues that might be getting in their way. Find examples of a strength needed in a current situation that you have seen in them under different circumstances. (You do know how to organize, like the way you've lined up all of your hats.) My youngest son is 20 now and a junior in college. He manages to take care of himself, learn and get good grades, keep himself clothed and fed, and is very driven to work when he is home. I believe Strength-Spotting was largely responsible for a more positive march toward adulthood. If I had known that the things I worried about when he was young would resolve themselves at this point, while I am sure I would have still pushed back then, it would have come more from confidence that he was up to the challenge. That said, I am glad I learned this approach \u2014 was taught it? \u2014 even if it took so long. Because, better late than never. Annie Zirkel, M.A. L.P .C., is a local parenting consultant. You can reach her at annie@ practicehow.com. Common Situations and Strength-Spotting Situation: Child is being flip, rude, challenging, disrespectful The Strength: It sounds like you are trying to be funny...You clearly want to stand up for yourself...You have strong opinions...You are learning how to use your power...You are trying to express your anger... Then the Challenge: But it feels more rude or hurtful on my side... Now can you say it in a more respectful way? Situation: Child is very discouraged and giving up The Empathy: Your brain/body is working really hard to figure this out/complete this goal...You've been trying to do something really challenging (outside your comfort zone)... The Strength: I am impressed with how you are still trying even a little!...I know you don't think you can do this, but I have seen you conquer similar challenges like when you learned how to ride your bike, etc. (give concrete examples).Then the Challenge: (For the child) Maybe your expectations are too high for how quickly you are going to get this. Maybe you are being too hard on your brain and need a break. (For you, the parent) Find and share your faith that you know your child will get this, or if they don't, will still be ok. Then helping them break the goal down into however small of a next step they need to progress. \u2014 Annie ZirkelSavor a success rather than immediately moving to the next challenge. Think Bigger! A Gift from Alex When thinking about strengths, think bigger than skill attainment. While my two younger sons are off using all of their strengths to explore the world, my oldest son Alex is severely disabled. As far as skills go, I am proud to note that at 25 he: can hold his own cup and drink from a straw; feed himself blended food; offer his arms through his shirt when being dressed; walk assisted by a gait-trainer up to 500 feet; sign for eat and drink; and is working on learning to choose activities based on photo choices. If strengths were only seen as skills, the list would stop there. In fact, one of my biggest challenges over the years has been not focusing so much on the much longer list of things he can't do. But strengths are more than just about doing things. Some of his other strengths include his ability to soothe the world with his amaz - ing and simple smile. His defiance at doing stuff just because others want him to. His insistence that he matters. His ability to forgive my imperfect support of him. His ability to remind the world of more able beings that heart matters. And that there is plenty for people to be grateful for about their own lives. When looking for strengths in your child (yourself and others), it can help to remember that people matter and are worthwhile even if they can't do all that much to prove it. \u2014 Annie Zirkel 2017 Summer Camps!

SafeUnsubscribe The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 72 Dancing for Birth \u2014 A Language of Movement for Pregnancy Pregnant moms dance to teach their bodies this language of movement so that when labor begins, they can use these movements to lessen pain, shorten labor, and increase satisfaction with their birth journey. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 73 Dancing for Birth is a group where we explore a language of movement for pregnancy, birth, and after birth. It was created by birth worker and dancer, Stephanie Larson. I have extensive experience in the birth community, although I am not a dancer. This keeps the classes informal and relaxed. In 2007, I became a Certified Professional Midwife. I have attended births in Michigan, Maine, Oregon, Texas, and Senegal, Africa. I am no longer a CPM but am very busy within the birthing community. As a birth and postpartum doula, I assist in home births with local midwives, and I teach childbirth education classes as well as the Dancing for Birth group. I have three children and live in Ann Arbor. When you experience this class, you will see it is deeply rooted in sacred sharing and wisdom exchange. As an \"instructor,\" I facilitate this by holding the space, but much of what is gained is through the essential connection that happens during class time, which is lacking in our society. We have become so separated from one another that we have lost this connection. Coming to circle with your sisters to share and learn is needed the most during the childbearing year. Many moms feel disconnected, alone, and afraid. Eighty percent of mothers experience some baby blues, while twenty percent will experience postpartum depression. Furthermore, we can be fairly certain that these numbers are lower than reality, as the stigma around mental health remains strong. The way to combat this is to participate in a loving community who will respect you and your choices as a mom (whatever they may be), and encourage self-love, acceptance, and growth. This is Dancing for Birth. Pregnant moms participate in the group dance to encourage positive positioning (helping the baby find its fit within the pelvis to promote easier labor) and for toning and strengthening to prepare for birth. They dance to teach their bodies this language of movement so that when labor begins, they can use these movements to lessen pain, shorten labor, and increase satisfaction with their birth journey. After birth, mom can dance with her baby to help to strengthen her core and pelvic muscles, as well as maintain flexibility during a strenuous time in her life. Dancing lasts about half of the 90-minute class, and is done in a circle. We focus on belly-dancing-type moves, but dabble in other types of dance as well. All moms learn from each other, gather birthing and parenting tips, and participate in rituals of growth. We explore topics from the birthing community and from abroad (with cultural reverence), such as \"Closing of the Bones,\" baby wearing, meditation, pelvic floor repair tips and maintenance, \"Spinning Babies\" exercises, Rebozo use for labor, and many others. I share my tried and true practitioner referrals for common issues relating to pregnancy and birth, and am available to answer questions or to help navigate through difficult emotional times, which often present themselves during the tumultuous life events of pregnancy, birth, and becoming a parent. Come join us! This is a group that will fill your cup for the week, leaving you connected, thankful, and supported. (Providers and doulas are welcome.) Whitney Kolongowski is a childbirth educator, birth doula, and Dancing for Birth certified instructor. She teaches at the Center for the Childbearing Year located in Ann Arbor.

Spiritual director Jonathan Ellis is a former co-owner of Crazy Wisdom and then continued to be a mentor and friend to the longtime current owners. He serves five dozen or so individuals each month from a variety of backgrounds, faiths, and professions who seek guidance on their own spiritual journey through life. He writes: \"If you do something over 10,000 times, you are ready to teach! I have had more than that number of sessions with folks, in person in Ann Arbor and by phone around the country, as an independent spiritual director for over 20 years now. \"I will turn age 70 soon and want to train new colleagues in the next few years. As a spiritual director, you are not someone who decides a direction for others. In sessions once a month, you help people sort through their ideas and feelings about the spiritual path of their own choosing. With your support, folks get to step back, see their life from a spiritual perspective, and focus their intention. \"I have so far mentored over a dozen people to become independent spiritual directors, all of whom had a background in a helping profession and a well developed spirituality of their own. Training now involves two individual sessions a month with me for a year, then working yourself under my guidance for a second year. \"In a common practice, I offer this independent spiritual director training on an open donation basis.

Jonathan Ellis \" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 80 A Simple Nature Walk Yields a World of Discovery By Steven Parrish Robber flies mimic the appearance of bumblebees \u2014 and they're known for capturing their prey on the wing. Here, a robber fly takes down a damselfly in distress. Spring heralds important pollinators, including bumblebees. Here, a bumblebee laps up bladdernut nectar.The natural world becomes more vibrant when you start to make sense of its mysteries. It's also nice to simply stay with the moment and appreciate the sense of wonder that nature inspires.See what genius and inspiration can come from taking time to observe nature's brilliant designs.\"Stop! Do you hear that? Shhh, listen . . .\" On a morning in early spring, I'm standing with a group of fifth graders near the edge of a wetland. A sound like a thumbnail going up and down a fine-tooth comb can be heard in the distance. \"Anyone have any ideas?\" I ask. \"A bird?\" says one. \"A chipmunk?\" asks another. I shake my head. \"What might be in the water at this time of year?\" I ask. \"Frogs!\" one answers. \"You got it, it's a western chorus frog.\" Michigan is home to 12 different species of frogs and toads. And just like with birds, you can identify the kind of frog or toad by knowing the specific call it gives. At this point, I usually give the group my best impersonation of a number of other species, such as a deep twangy \"gung...gung...gung,\" like the plucking of a loose banjo string, which signals the presence of a green frog. Or I'll whistle the long monotone trill of the American toad. The natural world becomes more vibrant when you start to make sense of its mysteries. It's also nice to simply stay with the moment and appreciate the sense of wonder that nature inspires. One Discovery Leads to Another What does it mean to take a walk in nature? As a natural areas specialist at Matthaei Botanical Gardens, I ask myself that question every time I take a walk in nature with one of my volunteer groups or kids-ed class. Sometimes I start with no agenda, just remaining open to walking and observing. When I combine my sense of wonder with my scientific understanding, and invite participants to become aware of their senses, our walk becomes an adventure where many discoveries and connections are made. Of course, it helps to select an interesting site for walking, somewhere along a creek, wetland, or woodland, but basically, if you can slow down, have an open mind, and be in the moment, it's amazing what you can behold. I love sharing with people this free-association in nature, where one discovery leads to another. Take, for example, the phenomenon of mimicry, where one animal is disguised to look like another animal. When one of our groups goes out on a walk, we might see something we think is a bumblebee ... until we take a closer look. It's remarkable to watch a robber fly, a bumblebee mimic, lie in waiting on a sun-dappled leaf in an oak-hickory forest, its head shifting quickly with every little movement, gauging whether an insect flying overhead is within striking range. I have observed robber flies do mid-air captures of beetles, moths, wasps, other robber flies, and even other aerial predators, including bright blue damselflies. It's no wonder this creature is considered the \"peregrine falcon of the insect world.\" Often along our walks, folks ask me a lot of questions. For example, if I point out the radial or zig-zag pattern of trails left by a bark beetle in a fallen elm or ash, someone will invariably ask, \"Why do the trails get bigger?\" I want people to look, observe, wonder, and see what kinds of ideas they can come up with. I give clues or answer a question with another question, and \u2014 eventually and collaboratively \u2014 we realize that an egg is laid under the bark, and a hungry young bark beetle larva matures. The larva begins to eat the bark, and as it eats, it gets bigger, thus producing a trail that increases in width. In late summer the jewelweed seeds mature and put on an exciting show. I like to find the seed pods that look like plump green bananas, ever so gently pull one from its translucent stem, hand it over to the first unsuspecting pair of eager hands, and have them give it a squeeze. POP! The seeds scatter in every direction; the seed-holder (victim) jumps and is left with several twisted green tendrils. This is a great time to discuss the magic of seed dispersal. There are many ways a plant disperses Nibble on a sassafras leaf stem for its root beer taste, or crush one of its leaves and be transported to memories of childhood when the smell of Froot Loops cereal wafted through the air.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 81 \"You eat more, you get bigger.\" Galleries left by bark beetles expand as the larvae consume the inner layer of a tree's bark. its seeds: via wind (think tufts of milkweed silk floating on a breeze, or maple-seed helicopters spiraling to earth); thanks to animals (squirrels burying nuts, or birds eating berries and distributing seeds); water (some seeds, such as the bladdernut, float); and the aforementioned jewelweed's explosive method of mechanical seed dispersal that scatters the seeds far and wide. The burdock plant, with its burs that attach to the fur of animals, was the inspiration for the invention of Velcro! See what genius and inspiration can come from taking time to observe nature's brilliant designs. Engage All the Senses For an optimal nature walk experience, I encourage participants to fully engage all the senses. Nibble on a sassafras leaf stem for its root beer taste, or crush one of its leaves and be transported to memories of childhood when the smell of Froot Loops cereal wafted through the air. Gently slap the smooth and solid trunk of a musclewood tree, or feel the invigorating (sometimes painful) zing of a run-in with wood nettle. Closely observe and consider whether your eyes (and mind) are jumping to conclusions. Is what you're seeing in fact a bumblebee? Is that sound actually coming from an insect or an amphibian? Next time you find yourself in a natural setting, try to clear away the usual sensory bombardment life throws your way and become open to the discoveries that await. In looking for connections in nature, you, too, will become more connected. Steven Parrish is a Natural Areas Specialist at Matthaei Botanical Gardens and Nichols Arboretum.

It is accepted by most Hindu scholars to be the foremost text expounding the nature of the true guru and the importance of having a guru on the spiritual path. The guru-disciple relationship is one of the most potent of all spiritual practices that promotes an authentic experience of the inner Self. History is full of examples of powerful spiritual teachers who have shared their wisdom through direct contact with sincere seekers. The Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta saint Umapati Shivacharya says, \"As people catch beasts and birds by presenting one of the same kind, so grace has taken the human form to catch men, or make them draw nigh without fear.\" The regular study of the Guru Gita provides a framework for understanding how the grace bestowing aspect of the Divine can manifest through human form for the benefit of all humankind. The full text of the Guru Gita, as we know it today, is made up of over 400 verses from the Upanishads, various Tantras, and an ancient text known as the Skanda Purana. It is believed to have been compiled between the 6th and 15th centuries and is ascribed to the sage Veda Vyasa. Over time various scholars and teachers have selected verses from the original text to make smaller versions for teaching and chanting purposes. The Guru Gita narrates a long dialog between Lord Shiva and his consort Parvathi, in which she asks him to teach her about the true nature of the guru, the secret of all secrets that frees one from the cycle of birth and death, and bestows worldly fulfillment as well as spiritual liberation. The Skanda Purana contains stories, teachings, and various devotional hymns that provide guidance on how to live a virtuous life. One of the narratives in this scripture tells the story of how the Guru Gita came into existence. Once, while Shiva was expounding the supreme truth to a group of sages, he appeared to be reverently prostrating before an unknown deity. Goddess Parvathi was surprised to see Shiva bowing to someone else and asked him, \"Brahma, Vishnu, and Indra are always offering their prostrations to you. You being the recipient of their prostrations, who could possibly be so exalted that you should prostrate yourself before them?\" Lord Shiva's response was simple and direct, \"It is to the supreme guru I bow.\" He goes on to say, \"The supreme guru is none other than one's own Self. This is the truth. It is the duty of all mankind to make every effort to realize this. This supreme truth will reveal itself to the one whose devotion to the true guru equals his devotion to God.\" Upon hearing Shiva's response, Parvathi said to him, \"For the sake of humanity please reveal the path by which devotees may come to know the true guru and the non-dual nature of Brahman.\" Responding to her request, Lord Shiva sang the Guru Gita to her and described the guru principle, the proper ways of worshiping the Guru, and the methods and benefits of studying the \"In chanting the mind becomes saturated with the mantras and automatically becomes one-pointed. The heart becomes fixed on its goal and tastes the joy which is the inner essence of the mantras. Dreariness is overcome, anxieties vanish and the smoldering coals of failure are extinguished. You are spontaneously absorbed in the love and the contentment inside, in the realization that the heart is the abode of deep peace from where love springs, where steadfastness lies and the image of God shines forth.\" \u2014 Swami Muktananda Locally, the practice of chanting the Guru Gita has a delightful history. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 87 Guru Gita. Locally, the practice of chanting the Guru Gita has a delightful history. Forty-five years ago, in January of 1972, the influential Indian meditation master, Swami Muktananda, began having his devotees chant the Guru Gita as a daily practice at his ashram in Ganeshpuri, India. In September of 1974, during his second world tour, Swami Muktananda came to Ann Arbor and inaugurated his first residential ashram outside of India; it was named Siddha Yoga Dham of Ann Arbor. It is now the Siddha Meditation Center of Ann Arbor, and the daily practice of chanting the Guru Gita continues there to this day. Recitation of the Guru Gita is also open to the public every Saturday at the Kashi Nivas Shiva Meditation Center in Ann Arbor. Many of the spiritual aspirants that chanted the Guru Gita with Swami Muktananda over 40 years ago are still chanting it in Ann Arbor today. The chanting and study of this sacred text has become assimilated into the spiritual practices of other popular yoga traditions such as Transcendental Meditation, Integral Yoga Institute, Yoga Life Society, and many others. It has now become a daily practice in temples, ashrams, yoga centers, and homes all over the world. Arguably, no one in centuries has been more influential than Swami Muktananda for introducing the sacred and profound teachings of the Guru Gita to spiritual seekers worldwide. Speaking on the benefits of chanting the Guru Gita and other sacred mantras, Swami Muktananda said, \"In chanting the mind becomes saturated with the mantras and automatically becomes one-pointed. The heart becomes fixed on its goal and tastes the joy which is the inner essence of the mantras. Dreariness is overcome, anxieties vanish and the smoldering coals of failure are extinguished. You are spontaneously absorbed in the love and the contentment inside, in the realization that the heart is the abode of deep peace from where love springs, where steadfastness lies and the image of God shines forth.\" There are two locations in the Ann Arbor area where the public is invited to participate in the sacred practice of chanting the Guru Gita. It is chanted every day at the Siddha Yoga Meditation Center, 3017 Miller Road, Ann Arbor, MI, (734) 726-0318, www.symcannarbor.org. It is also chanted every Saturday at the Kashi Nivas Shiva Meditation Center, 515 Manor Drive, Ann Arbor, MI, (734) 883-6947, http://kashinivas.org.

It is a privilege to help them pursue their goals particularly when they have the intention to also help others or the planet. When we want to help specific other people, the process is usually through a will or trust, or by designating a beneficiary for an investment. When we want to help the planet or the population as a whole, then we can have an effect by how and where we invest our money. Socially responsible investing (SRI) is the process of making investment decisions based on the investor's individual values regarding social issues such as politics, culture, finance, ethics, health, government policies, or the environment. Naturally, it can mean very different things to different people, but the intention is to seek financial growth and social wellbeing at the same time. One of the things that sets SRI apart from most investing strategies is that it intentionally involves an emotional component. Until recently, the average investor did not have the financial resources or the tools to investigate and evaluate each company in which he or she might want to invest. Because of our more advanced Internet technology, values-based investing is available to many more people. SRI is bigger than ever and more effective than ever. Until now the average person had not been able to achieve such a high degree of awareness about the world at large. Companies and whole industries are now more transparent, whether they want to be or not. Those seeking a more peaceful world are now able to avoid investing in arms and military industries if they wish. Those concerned with global relations are now able to determine more accurately what companies demonstrate quality governance and positive leadership. A person concerned about the stewardship of the environment may want his investment to reflect his concerns. Spiritually based values can be effectively expressed in the local and global marketplace and with little fanfare, if that is the desire. Even though the objective of investing is to improve your future financial position, it is becoming easier to manage investment goals and to make a positive impact on the world at the same time. Most of us, including myself, already make many purchases based at least partly on our values and sense of justice. When I purchase goods and services I may choose to buy local rather than from a huge corporation. Sometimes I notice there are ingredients in food I want to avoid. By choosing not to buy that product I send a small but noticeable message to the manufacturer and the industry as well. In the same way, by making conscious investment choices, we can encourage companies to make healthy decisions for their shareholders as well as the planet. According to the \"Conference on Sustainable, Responsible, and Impact Investing\" [www.SRIconference.com] the history of SRI can be traced back to ancient times when more advanced ethical thinking developed. Ancient religious leaders and philosophers began to encourage the populous to practice this new ethical enlightenment and extend it to investing in more ethical ways. As they encouraged a more just and sustainable society, the leaders even discouraged the procedure of charging interest when lending money. Imagine today's business world without the use of interest. In the mid-1600s, the Quakers brought to America the idea of \"values based investing.\" For example, they did not invest in anything related to slavery or war. In the 1700s, John Wesley, founder of the Methodist Church, believed making financial equality a routine part of the social fabric would lead to a more just and equitable society. Modern SRI began to develop in the 1960s in conjunction with other forms of social activism. Throughout the 80's and 90's, the amount of socially responsible investors grew drastically, in response to the major social and environmental issues of the time, such as Exxon Valdez, Chernobyl, and Apartheid. Now, in the age of the Internet, it is much easier for people to become aware of issues and then to research on their own how they can address them. Most investors will find that they enjoy the process of participating in this potentially rewarding form of investing. It can be factored into retirement planning or personal investing. Some people may have a special interest in SRI because of their circumstances or a meaningful event in their lives. For most investors, the intent is to influence companies to improve their stewardship of the company's money and other resources. I find SRI to be a small but sure way of putting my personal spirituality in motion. Like the world at large, the financial industry is becoming more complex. A financial professional with a special interest in SRI would be glad to help you choose the right investment and help you through this process. As for me, I believe in the law of gradual change. As long as it happens quickly of course. For today I will accept any movement in the right direction. So, in the end, the question may be, is it possible for an investor to attain their financial goals and still feel good about being engaged with the world in order to make it a better place? I sure hope the answer is yes, and maybe we can even have some fun while doing it. David L.

In the same way, when we choose to purchase a product that is produced locally, sold by local merchants, or is produced in an acceptable manner, we send a positive message of caring in action.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 97 Tarot and Divination Drop-In Tarot Readings with Gail Embery First and Third Fridays, 6:30-9:30 p.m.; First and Third Sundays, 3-6 p.m. at Crazy Wisdom Make enlightened life choices as Gail guides you through difficult times by skillfully consulting the Tarot to get answers for you and by accessing her psychic/medium abilities. $1.50 per minute.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2017 Page 100 By Holly Makimaa Almost 15 years ago, a friend asked me a question I frequently ask others now: \"Are you willing to risk finding out what your gifts are?\" The world could not be more ready for each of us to discover, cultivate, and use our gifts to help heal our society. Yet, how many times do we let fear get in the way of us stepping forward to listen to and act on our inner callings? At the time my friend challenged me to listen to my inner calling, I was contemplating teaching my first public series of writing for healing classes. Even though I had been sharing these tools informally for years, my doubts almost kept me from moving forward: Would the classes really help people? What if I didn't know enough? What if I failed in some way? Yet, my friend's loving words flipped fear on its head and helped me to get curious about the possibilities. Since that day, I have facilitated nearly 100 classes and workshops, sat with people at critical junctures in their lives, and seen miracles regularly occur as people listen deeply. It has been one of my life's greatest joys to watch people's lives transform through writing about and sharing their spiritual journeys in small classes, on retreats, and in private coaching sessions. I have witnessed individuals leave unfulfilling careers and start their own businesses or nonprofits based on their soul passions; I have seen students go back to school or begin additional training in their 70s; I have held space for men to find the courage to grieve the loss of children; I have energetically held men and women as they find forgiveness for the tragedies in their lives; I have watched people risk all to listen to their hearts' longings; and I have encouraged students to release the weight of stories they carried alone \u2014 only for them to recognize they are not alone. Along the way, I have learned more than I could have ever imagined I would need to know about holding sacred space, and I am still learning. I went back for additional training as a journaling facilitator, an interspiritual minister, a bioenergetics facilitator, and a spiritual coach during the 15 years since my friend's question. But, none of it could have happened without my saying yes to the initial calling. Of course, none of it would have happened either without my own spiritual coaches and writing peers holding me in a sacred space when I went through challenging times with illness, the death of loved ones, or other life changes. The dictionary defines a calling as \"a strong inner impulse toward a particular course of action especially when accompanied by conviction of divine influence.\" In a more long-term sense, calling refers to \"the vocation or profession in which one customarily engages.\" I like to define it more simply. I think what it takes to live our calling is the courage to be honest about what needs to be called forth at any given time. There's a thread line or calling we might follow our whole lives, like to be a healer, an artist, or a parent, and then there are the callings we find ourselves called to in any given season. For instance, after the death of a parent, some are called to be still and make sense of the mystery of life and death by going inward. Other seasons, for instance, are far busier, like when launching a project, raising young children, responding to a social movement, and so on. Urgency demands a more masculine output of energy. Times of reflection require a more feminine approach. Our world is learning how to balance these two approaches, and it is more important than ever that we honor both ways of being in the world as we live our callings. Listening to our callings and acting upon them is a refined skill. People who go into formal religious life spend a lot of time discerning their life direction. But the majority of people don't have a container or space to be able to honor and really listen to what is drawing them. I was raised in a religious tradition that had a forum for people to discern how to act on their spiritual inclinations. I found that extremely helpful and am passionate about making sure people of all faiths, spiritual backgrounds, and from all walks of life, including those with no official ties to a community, have such a space to explore their callings. I once heard a woman at a workshop say that something \"called her forth.\" I like that notion. What calls the real you forth? In the coaching sessions and groups I offer, I create a sacred container for people to listen deeply and voice what moves them. What moves people is often what lights them up inside or continues to knock at the door of their hearts. At this critical time on the planet, each of us is being invited to do our part. I believe that by each of us digging deeper into our truths, together we will live into the answers. We must forge the new way by listening deeply to our callings and inspiring those around us to follow suit. No longer is there a time when someone else will do the work for us. We are the ones who are called to co-create. Will you risk finding out what your gifts are this year? As an avid dancer, I am moved by the famous quote from choreographer Martha Graham. It applies every bit as much to dance as it does to life and to listening to our callings: There is a vitality, a life force, an energy, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of you in all of time, this expression is unique. And if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and it will be lost. The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is nor how valuable nor how it compares with other expressions. It is your business ... to keep the channel open ... Holly Makimaa facilitates classes, rituals, groups, and private spiritual coaching sessions to support people in healing and transformation. She holds the vision of all people creatively and joyfully activating their gifts within their communities. As an interfaith/interspiritual minister, she honors all spiritual paths as sacred.

She is the refractive clarity of revelation. iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii \"Goddess of wisdom, who appears as syllables. Words, sentences, and understanding,Goddess in whom all meaning inheresFrom beginningless time, grant me your grace. Goddess who purifies and enriches the soul, You who are the treasurer of intelligence, Please accept these words, my humble offering!\"\u2014 Sarasvati Rahasya Upaniad How does one begin to describe the essence of the Eternal Muse? From Calliope and her eight sister Muses in ancient Greece to the Green Fairy in bohemian 19th century Paris, the metaphorical concept of pure artistic enlightenment, exploration and inspiration is found throughout the ages of human history. One of the very oldest representations of this creative current is found in India: the Goddess Sarasvt. Sarasvt embodies Divine Inspiration, that which many an artist, whether they be a painter, poet, writer, musician or dancer, has chased to the end of sanity. Sarasvt is the avatar of inspiration who incites us to drop everything and dive deep into our creative impulses. Her name, in Sanskrit, is comprised of two words: \"saras,\" meaning \"essence\" or \"current,\" and \"vt,\" meaning \"possessed.\" Thereby, Sarasvt's name translates as \"possession of the Divine current or essence.\" A current (whether of water or electricity) is never itself; it is formless, taking its shape from what is around it. Moreover, the term \"essence\" evokes the idea of something that never changes, a core or fundamental truth. These two meanings for the same Sanskrit terms may seem paradoxical at first, but they take us into the true heart of this incredible Goddess. In the Tantric tradition, she is said to have a \"vajra kaya,\" a lightning or diamond body. Within this paradox of lightning (current) and a diamond (essence), we can delve further into the philosophical truths of Sarasvt. She provides the penetrative inspiration that literally hits like a thunderbolt (electrical current) when least expected, and like a hard prismatic diamond (essence) that is unchanging. She is the refractive clarity of revelation. Sarasvt is always portrayed dressed in a white sari, relatively unadorned, and seated on a lotus or swan. She has either two or four hands which are playing a vina (a stringed instrument), holding a book (the sacred text of the Vedas), a mala, and sometimes a barbed hook or spear. Her role as Goddess of the supreme Word, both divine and mundane, spoken and vibratory, is represented by the book she holds as well as the mala, which is used to count mantra during japa (recitation). Her aspect of Par Vch, or \"Supreme Word,\" is represented by the book of knowledge or the \"Vedas,\" the oldest layer of Sanskrit or Vedic literature, which encompasses liturgical material, poems, and hymns of the Vedic religion. Language and speech are considered the vehicle for the knowledge of spiritual liberation, as the sacred teachings of the Vedas were passed down orally for thousands of years. Her crystal mala represents her power to chant \"mantra,\" sacred sound or vibration, and her mastery of the Sanskrit alphabet. Mantra is believed to have the power to alter the nature of reality itself, as the Universe is nothing more than vibration, and thus reflects the creative power of Sarasvt. Her immense knowledge and wisdom is celebrated during the festival of Vasant Panchami in India, where educational institutions conduct special prayers to her, and new schools are often inaugurated during this auspicious day. As she plays the strings of the vina, an allegory for the human spinal column, she plays us into being on the fabric of consciousness. Sarasvt is Divine Consciousness descending into this reality as if in migration, embodied by the swan, a bird taking flight at the most optimal moment, in the moment, rather than by a predetermined schedule. As Sarasvt descends she is likened to the swan, or \"hamsa\" in Sanskrit, which is the onomatopoeia for the sound of the passage breath as we inhale and exhale. So too like the Moon, reflecting the light of the Sun, does Sarasvt reflect the process of consciousness as it moves from Source into Self. Her divine nature is pure \"ll,\" or play, serving as a perfect complement to \"karma\" (action). Every karma has a causality, an accountability, and a consequence, while ll has no purpose, goal or meaning unto itself. There is no point of play other than to play! Sarasvt is loosely associated with the god Brahma (the Creator), but she is not a wife or attached to any one god in a sensual way. She remains fully autonomous, abiding in her own nature like a current that will not be contained. Sarasvt is the intoxicating nature of Ananda (bliss), in which we experience the invariant presence of the Self, or the \"atman,\" as part of Consciousness. Within this ecstasy is a toxicity; for that is the price of wildness, as it would otherwise become domestic. She is anything but domestic. If this ecstasy was not at least somewhat toxic, we would stay in that state of bliss forever and therefore lose the play of consciousness. She invites us to the experience of \"abhisara,\" the peaks and troughs of life. We must experience both the highs and the lows, for without these polar experiences, neither would be possible. We are tasked to savor the experiences, both shadow and light; to ride the cyclical nature of embodied experience like the peaks and valleys of ocean waves, or the waxing and waning nature of the Moon. One of my teachers, Douglas Brooks, always reminds us that we are every character in the story or myth. The invitation that Sarasvt extends to us then, is one of reflection. We are entreated to see ourselves within the images of the Divine and then to recognize ourselves as the Divine's own reflection. Sarasvt represents our creative expression, the integrity and truthfulness in our speech, and the accumulated wisdom from our experiences of our life. Her autonomy reminds us that everything we need, we already possess, and when she invites us to stop and play for a moment, we are able to reconnect to the experience of inner bliss, spontaneity, and our very own wild, uninhibited nature.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal staff had remade my card so that it is clearer and easier to read, and more appealing and eye-catching, and best of all, they had done this for free. This is one of the ways that the customer service at Crazy Wisdom goes above and beyond other advertising venues. Kudos to Rory and the other staff!\" \u2014 Stephen Rassi, Chrysalis Facilitation and Counseling Services, LLC Advertise in The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal and reach over 25,000 loyal readers in southeastern Michigan interested in a healthy, holistic, and conscious lifestyle!Join our family of satisfied advertisers ...
