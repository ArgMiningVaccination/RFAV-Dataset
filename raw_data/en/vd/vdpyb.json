Renee' Gideon Office & Accounts Manager Central Regional Dental Testing Service, Inc. 1725 SW Gage WREB Announce Merg er Dear State Boards of Dentistry Members and Executive Directors, The Commission on Dental Competency Assessment and the Western Regional Examining Board, the two leading dental competency assessment organizations in the United States, are pleased to announce that the final steps to complete the previously announced merger have been completed. WREB's member states, represented by their members of the Dental Exam Review Board (DERB) and Hygiene Exam Review Board (HERB), met on July 21 and heard the details of the proposed merger. They voted unanimously to support the merger. The CDCA's General Assembly met on August 3 and also voted unanimously to approve the Plan of Merger along with linked Constitution and Bylaws changes that support the new org anization and fully incorporate WREB examiners. Effective immediately, the new organization will be known as CDCA -WREB. Together the agency will simplify the needs of boards, licensure candidates, and schools as we continue to serve the oral health professions. \"We come together with 100 years combined experience between the two organizations...when you look at the simplification for educators and consistency for the students, it's going to be a great marriage for the two organizations to come together,\" proclaimed CDCA Board of Directors Chairman, Dr. Harvey Weingarten. WREB President, Dr. Robert Lauf agreed, stating that, \"Portability is definitely the key to this union. We are very excited in providing a national examination for the dental and dental hygiene programs.\" Please click the video link to view the full comments from CDCA -WREB leadership.

Stephanie Beeler Multimedia, Communications and Strategic Projects Leader 443.270.3090 The CDCA is now CDCA -WREB Click cdcaexams .org or wreb.org to learn more FAQs: Please see the following, which offers detailed responses to questions we've previously received. We hope this is helpful to you, and we certainly look forward to seeing everyone this evening! Q: How will the influx of new members into the combined organization break down? Membership at a Glance: CDCA members already affiliated with WREB: 66 CDCA (existing total: 1052) Member Dentists 476 Member Hygienists 172 Consultant Dentists 242 Consultant Hygienists 162 Proposed additions: WREB (unique: 158) Member Dentists: 43 Member Hygienists: 24 Consultant Dentists: 46 Consultant Hygienists: 45 * Newly added WREB voting members would become approximately 10% of the voting membership. Q: Won't participation opportunities be lessened with an increase of examiners? This is not expected to be the case. While additional examiners will be a part of the combined organization, there will also be many additional exams to serve for both Dental and Dental Hygiene examinations. Sites that historicall y offered WREB examinations will transition to ADEX examination locations by 2023. Q: What examination will be delivered by CDCA -WREB? CDCA -WREB will offer both the WREB and ADEX examinations through 2022 to best facilitate the needs of candidates and schools. Following this transition year, CDCA -WREB will administer the ADEX examination for Dental and Dental Hygiene for 2023 and beyond. CDCA -WREB will also offer other non- ADEX assessment examinations that are currently offered by WREB and/or CDCA to best support state board needs. Q: How will states/licensure candidates/schools be impacted by this merger? We expect that this combination will simplify steps and processes for most states, schools and licensure candidates while also assisting in deve loping further consensus for a common licensure standard. Portability of the ADEX examinations is the highest compared to other licensure pathways. In fact, the ADEX dental exam is now accepted in every US jurisdiction that requires an independent 3rd party licensure exam. The CDCA -WREB staff teams in both the eastern and western offices look forward to coming together in a smooth transition as part of a shared mission in support of the oral health professions. Q: After the proposed combined transition Board of Directors sunsets in January of 2024, there will be 2 newly added members at large positions permanently added. Why are both new positions dentists? Both combining organization's Boards wanted to fit Board representation to best reflect the membership. At this time, member dentists/dental hygienists are approximately 76%/24% of voting members. With 7 Board members at large, 5 dentists (71%) and 2 dental hygienist (29%) generally reflects these percentages. Other elected board positions are undesignated and open to all. From: Beth Cole < bcole@wreb.org > Subject: Special Meeting of DERB and HERB Good Morning, Please mark your calendars to attend a Special Combined meeting of the WREB Dental Exam Review Board and the Hygiene Exam Review Board on Wednesday evening, July 21, 2021 at 6 pm PDT.

AN ACT Relating to health care interpreters; creating an emer- gency. Whereas current law contains a loophole for health care providers and interpretation service companies to justify working with untrained health care interpreters despite the availability of health care interpreters who are qualified or certified by the Oregon Health Authority; and Whereas current law does not hold accountable health care providers and interpretation service companies for failing to work with qualified or certified interpreters or for failing to work with best practices in providing health care interpretation services; and Whereas there is currently no complaint process for health care interpreters who experience wage or other labor violations; and Whereas there is a growing demand for health care interpreters in rural communities in this state, especially for interpreters capable of interpreting languages of limited diffusion in those areas; and Whereas health care interpreters suffer from the inequitable business practices of interpretation service companies; and Whereas due to the low payment rates and the rising cost of training and testing, current and potential health care interpreters are reluctant to invest in training, testing, qualification or certif- ication because of the low return on their investment; and Whereas there is a lack of uniformity statewide in the quality of health care interpretation services; and Whereas there is a lack of a uniform training curriculum statewide; now, therefore, Be It Enacted by the People of the State of Oregon: SECTION 1. Section 2 of this 2021 Act is added to and made a part of ORS 413.550 to 413.558. SECTION 2.

(2) The Legislative Assembly further finds that the lack of competent health care interpreters among health care providers impedes the free flow of communication between the health care pro- vider and patient, negatively impacting health outcomes and preventing clear and accurate communication and the development of empathy, confidence and mutual trust that is essential for an effective relationship between health care provider and patient. (3) It is the policy of the Legislative Assembly to require [the use of] working with certified health care interpreters or qualified health care interpreters [whenever possible] to ensure the ac- curate and adequate provision of health care to persons with limited English proficiency and to persons who communicate in [sign] signed language. (4) It is the policy of the Legislative Assembly that health care for persons with limited English proficiency be provided according to the guidelines established under the policy statement issued August 30, 2000, by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights, entitled, \"Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; Policy Guidance on the Prohibition Against Na- tional Origin Discrimination As It Affects Persons With Limited English Proficiency,\" and the 1978 Patient's Bill of Rights. SECTION 10. ORS 413.556 is amended to read: 413.556.

The training may be provided at no cost or, if not, must be affordable. (b) Maintain a record of all health care interpreters who have completed an approved training program. (c) Establish and maintain a central registry for all health care interpreters who are qualified or certified by the authority and establish a process for health care interpreters to biennially update their contact information and confirm their participation in the registry.

Surveys were sent at the beginning of both January and July 2021 to the following groups of stakeholders: Licensees, Workplace Monitors, Providers (GMC/PMCs and third-party evaluators), and Health Associations. An overview of the number of surveys sent, number of responses received, and the response rate by stakeholder group is displayed below: Table 1: Response Rate - Year 11 Licensees Workplace Monitors Providers (GMC/PMC/3rd Party Evaluators) Health Associations # Sent 354 327 48 16 # of Responses 55 20 12 3 Response Rate 15.5% 6.1% 25.0% 18.8% Response rates were low for licensees and workplace monitors. Although there are many ways to interpret this, it could be an indicator of the ongoing level of stress that health professionals (both the licensees and workplace monitors) are experiencing in the workplace. IBH will continue to be sensitive to this issue and will try to provide increased support and resources for licensees. In addition, HPSP Agreement Monitors will re-double their efforts to develop rapport with and be supportive of workplace monitors. Highlights Licensee responses were received from all four boards: o Just over 98% \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" that they understand the program's statutory monitoring requirements. o A strong majority feel that they are treated with dignity (76.4%) and respect (80%). o 78.6% feel that the program requirements are clearly explained. o 87.3% feel that HPSP provides a \"significant amount\" or between a \"significant amount\" and \"some\" structure. 89.1% of respondents feel this way about the program's accountability. o A minimum of 83% of respondents \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" that: questions/concerns are to within one business day; questions/concerns are addressed fully; information is communicated clearly and professionally; and the Agreement Monitor is knowledgeable about his/her case. o The portal was used by 80% of respondents and, of those, 73% find it \"useful\" it \"excellent.\" All GMC/PMC providers and evaluator respondents rated the program positively. o 100% of respondents felt that questions and concerns were responded to promptly and that information was communicated clearly and professionally. o 93% indicated that they had all necessary information was on hand when they met with the licensee. o All but one respondent provided an \"excellent\" or \"above average\" rating of their overall experience working with HPSP staff. The other respondent provided an \"average\" rating. Notably, 50% provided an excellent rating. Responses were received from Workplace Monitors for licensees from each board: o All but one workplace monitor respondent indicated that they are satisfied with IBH's support in his/her role as a workplace monitor. o IBH's ability to monitor licensees to ensure safety in the workplace is endorsed by 95% of monitors who provided a rating. o \"Excellent\" was the most frequent response to the items rating IBH's services, including response timeframe; knowledge of licensee when there is a concern in the workplace; ability to respond to questions regarding program administration; frequency of feedback; and overall services. o 95% rated their overall experience working with IBH as \"excellent,\" \"above average,\" or \"average.\" Attachment #7 July 2021 - Year 11 Annual Report 3 Representatives of three professional associations, representing licensees of the Medical Board, Nursing Board and Pharmacy Board, provided survey responses. o HPSP's services were rated as \"extremely valuable\" (1) or valuable (2) for membership. o \"Excellent\" and \"above average\" were the ratings of HPSP's timeliness of response, knowledge level of staff and HPSP's services overall. o Feedback from members was rated \"above average\" by those who provided a rating. o IBH worked diligently in the spring to hold conversations with the various professional associations. These efforts will continue. All responses will be reviewed by the PAC and an action plan will be put into place to provide for continued improvement. Attachment #7 July 2021 - Year 11 Annual Report 4 IBH Solutions Health Professionals' Services Program (HPSP) Satisfaction of LICENSEES Purpose The purpose of assessing participants (licensees) in the Health Professionals' Services Program (HPSP) is to obtain constructive feedback that can be used to improve and maintain the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of HPSP. In order to provide continuous quality services, IBH evaluates licensees' satisfaction with HPSP twice yearly. Feedback is obtained from licensees via a satisfaction survey that is mailed or emailed to each licensee. When mailed, licensees are given the option of completing the enclosed survey and mailing it back to IBH in the postage-paid envelope or completing the survey online through the included link. The survey is short and can be completed in 2-3 minutes. Feedback includes information about program administration, IBH customer service, communication, Agreement Monitors, the portal, and overall services. One method of determining the value of HPSP is through the Satisfaction Survey. One of the roles of the IBH Policy Advisory Committee (PAC) is quality management. Following review of the survey results, the PAC will identify opportunities for improvement and develop interventions if necessary. The PAC will continue to monitor performance at specified intervals following the implementation of the intervention(s). Data Results Response Rate Table 1: Response Rate This Period Year 11 Year 10 Year 9 Year 8 Year 7 # Sent 172 354 387 383 403 435 # of Responses 19 55 65 80 99 149 Response Rate 11.0% 15.5% 16.8% 20.1% 24.6% 34.3% The HPSP Licensee Satisfaction Survey was issued to all the licensees who had been enrolled for more than 4 months. This delay allows licensees to become established in the program before providing program feedback. The survey was emailed to 159 licensees and mailed to 13 this period, for a total of 172 surveys distributed. A total of 19 responses were received, representing a response rate of 11.0%. This is the lowest rate we have seen to-date and should be monitored carefully moving forward. For the year, a total of 354 surveys were distributed with 55 responses received, bringing the response rate to 15.5%, just over 1 percentage point lower than last year's rate. Results, then, should be considered with caution as it cannot be assumed that the results represent all participants. Attachment #7 July 2021 - Year 11 Annual Report 5 Respondents Question 1: Respondents are first asked the board by which they are licensed. Data is displayed in Table 2. For both the period and the year, roughly half the respondents were licensed by the Medical Board, one-quarter by the Board of Nursing, and 10% each by the Board of Dentistry and Board of Pharmacy. One individual chose not to list his/her licensing board. It is encouraging to see representation from all four boards. Data Table 2: Table 3 displays a response rate for each Board for the period (responses by board divided by number surveyed per board). These rates can be compared to the overall response rate for the period of 11.0% so that any skew in the data can be identified. In this case, responses are skewed slightly toward the Board of Dentistry and away from the Board of Nursing. This skew is minimal, however, representing a difference of 1 licensee. Data Table 3: Table 3: Response Rate by Board This Period Number Surveyed Number of Respondents Response Rate Medical Board 83 9 10.8% Board of Nursing 58 5 8.6% Board of Dentistry 12 2 16.7% Board of Pharmacy 19 2 10.5% Question 2: Continuing to learn about the response pool, the survey then asks if the respondent is currently participating in the toxicology program. Results for the period and the year show that 89% of respondents were testing. Licensees with mental health only diagnoses with no indication of a substance use disorder are not required to test unless required by their board or recommended by their independent third-party evaluator.

These statements include understanding the program's statutory requirements, the ability of the program to treat the licensee with dignity and with respect, and the program requirements being clearly explained. Although original response data is displayed in Tables 5a-c, the chart below combines the data for the year to provide additional insight into the response patterns: Strongly Agree or Agree Disagree or Strongly Disagree I understand the program's statutory monitoring requirements (regardless if I agree with it or not). 98.2% 1.8% The program treats me with dignity. 76.4% 23.7% The program treats me with respect. 80.0% 20.0% The program requirements are clearly explained. 78.2% 21.8% Importantly, just over 98% of respondents \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" that they understand the program's statutory monitoring requirements. The majority of respondents also feel that they are treated with dignity (76.4%) and respect (80%). Finally, over three-quarters of respondents (78.6%) feel that the program requirements are clearly explained. When compared with last year's data (Table 5c), the total percentage of \"strongly agree\" or \"agree\" responses is within a few percentage points on each item. Mode responses this year were \"strongly agree\" for the dignity item, split between \"strongly agree\" and \"agree\" for the respect item and \"agree\" for the other two.

The scale is \"0\" (none) to \"4\" (a significant amount) with \"2\" representing \"some.\" The mode response was a \"significant amount\" (4) for both items for the period and the year. This is consistent with responses the last few years. Looking at this year's data, the percentage of \"3\" and \"4\" responses was 87.3% for structure and 89.1% for accountability, both of which are an increase from last year.

Data tables 7a-c show the specific responses to each item and the mode responses. The chart below combines the \"strongly agree\" and \"agree\" responses as well as the \"strongly disagree\" or \"disagree\" responses for the year: The clear majority of respondents positively endorsed each item. That said, the percentage of \"strongly agree\" and \"agree\" responses is a few points lower than last year on all items. The mode for \"my Agreement Monitor is knowledgeable about my case\" was \"strongly agree,\" while it was \"agree\" for all other items this year. For the period, the mode response was \"strongly agree\" for all four items. Data Table 7a, b and c: The mode (most frequent) response is highlighted in red.

This year, 80% of respondents (44) indicated that they had used the portal, which is an increase from 75% who did so last year. Further, of those who use portal, approximately 73% find it \"useful\" or \"extremely useful.\" The mode is \"useful\" for both the period and the year, just like last year. Data Table 8: The mode (most frequent) response is highlighted in red. Table 8: If you used the HPSP Portal (hpspmonitoring.com) in the last six months, please rate its usefulness.

Actual Comments - This Period: **Note that comments are shown as the respondent typed or wrote them. Spelling, punctuation, and grammar have not been corrected. 1. It would not work at all once (see below). 2. Information about testing sites, especially weekend hours, is often incorrect and never seems to be updated. 3. The portal needs to continue to show after 5 pm if there is a test that day Attachment #7 July 2021 - Year 11 Annual Report 10 Overall Rating of Services Question #7 : Respondents are asked to rate the overall services. The mode response was \"excellent\" for both the period and the year. In total, 34.5% rated the program \"excellent\" while another 18.2% rated it \"above average.\" A total of 83.6% rated the program as \"average\" or better this year. That is an increase from last year's 78.4%. Data Table 9: The mode (most frequent) response is highlighted in red.

Names and locations have been removed for confidentiality purposes. 1. Great experience thus far. Thank you! 2. I feel the 5 year commitment is excessive 3. \"Average\" compared to what? I've had issues a few times with the app not working. Once, the app, portal, and automated phone would not let me check in and I was eventually sent to a person who seemed to not really understand that I was just trying to check in. Otherwise, I appreciate my agreement monitor's help with me starting a new job and making arrangements around it. My monitor ([Name]) is always helpful and is an asset to your program!!!!! 4. The Program and Agreement Monitors are attempting to monitor professionals that are under tremendous pressure in their careers and personal lives. They are oblivious to the demands of the professional and do not realize that it's impossible to abide by the Programs guidelines, nor do their employment monitors care about the guidelines. Working only 40 hrs a weeks is not sustainable in this professional nor is being able to leave to test. Attempting to even take a much deserved vacation proves to be more stressful in this program than it's worth. I'm jumping through the Programs hoops that are expensive but not even close to helpful. I expected support from the Program but instead it is just policing me and trying to catch me making a mistake. I've been a nurse for 13 years and in the program for 2 years, however I'm pursuing another career now. It's not worth the stress, pain and suffering - nursing shortages, the pandemic horrors, the abuse from patients and families, and all the demands of this Program. OSBN and HPSP do not care about nurses or other health care professionals, they just assume the worst in them. 5. My agreement monitor, [Name], is FANTASTIC!!! She is very knowledgable and helpful. Attachment #7 July 2021 - Year 11 Annual Report 116. IBH continues to be the biggest obstacle to my Recovery. IBH actively interferes with my ability to re-establish healthy habits both at work and at home. The understanding of my professional role and responsibilities is absolutely non-existent and no accommodations are made for supporting my career. Unless I am willing to discuss my history with whomever I am working with that day, I am forced to lie when I have to leave to test; aren't we supposed to be working on being honest? The attitude of IBH towards me is punitive despite almost 5 years of exemplary work. My Therapist, Physician and Workplace monitor are hassled and disrespected through no fault of their own; reports are lost or misplaced on a regular basis and documentation requests are not made in a timely manner and I am held responsible for IBH incompetence. Test sites when I travel are poorly prepared for me and require unreasonable amounts of time and effort (2.5 hours last time I tested on the road and the requirement that I twirl around naked in front of the observer since they didn't understand the procedure despite my giving them a copy in advance). The requirement to submit time and date stamped photos for a single Exemption Day to go hiking with my son was yet another example of IBH disrespect. IBH absolutely does NOT treat me with respect or dignity. Unfortunately for me, I have been monitored in other States and I have experienced Programs that care, support and are respectful. IBH is none of those things. Summary Analysis The response rate for this survey this year is 15.5%, the lowest to-date. The ongoing impact of the pandemic may be an issue, but this will need to be watched. Results should be considered with caution as it cannot be assumed that the results represent all program participants. Responses were received from all four boards, with roughly half the respondents licensed by the Medical Board, one-quarter by the Board of Nursing, and 10% each by the Board of Dentistry and Board of Pharmacy. This is fairly representative of the population that was surveyed with only a very slight skew toward the Board of Dentistry and away from the Board of Nursing. Importantly, just over 98% of respondents \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" that they understand the program's statutory monitoring requirements. The majority of respondents feel that they are treated with dignity (76.4%) and respect (80%). Finally, over three-quarters of respondents (78.6%) feel that the program requirements are clearly explained. The largest group of respondents endorsed that the program provides a \"significant amount\" of structure and accountability. Between 83% and 90% of all respondents \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" that their questions/concerns are responded to within one day; that their questions/concerns are addressed fully within the structure of the program; that information is communicated clearly and professionally and that their Agreement Monitor is knowledgeable about their case. Just over 80% (44) of respondents indicated that they had used the portal, which is an increase from 75% who did so last year. The largest group of respondents for both the period and the year rated portal as \"useful.\" Overall, 83.6% of respondents rated the program as \"excellent,\" \"above average\" or \"average\" this year. In fact, a rating of \"excellent\" was endorsed by 34.5% of respondents. All responses, including comments, will be reviewed closely by the PAC and addressed accordingly. Attachment #7 July 2021 - Year 11 Annual Report 12IBH Solutions Health Professionals' Services Program (HPSP) Satisfaction of WORKPLACE MONITORS Purpose The purpose of assessing the Workplace Monitors is to obtain constructive feedback that can be used to improve the services provided by HPSP. IBH strives to maintain the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of the program, and thus evaluates Workplace Monitors' satisfaction with HPSP twice yearly. Feedback is obtained from Workplace Monitor via a satisfaction survey that is emailed or mailed to Workplace Monitors who are asked to complete the survey online. The survey is short and can be completed in 2-3 minutes. Feedback includes information about timeliness of response, knowledge level of staff, the monthly safe practice form and an overall rating of IBH's support of the supervision of licensees. The survey also asks for any additional comments. One method of determining the value of HPSP is through the Satisfaction Survey. One role of the IBH Policy Advisory Committee (PAC) is that of quality management. Following review of the survey results, the PAC will identify opportunities for improvement and develop interventions if necessary. The PAC will continue to monitor performance at specified intervals following the implementation of the intervention(s). Data Results Response Rate Table 1: Response Rate This Period Year 11 Year 10 Year 9 Year 8 Year 7 # Sent 159 327 331 340 322 331 # Responses 5 20 60 42 46 62 Response Rate 3.1% 6.1% 18.1% 12.4% 14.3% 18.7% This period the Workplace Monitors' satisfaction survey had a response rate of only 3.1%, with 5 responses out of 159 surveys sent. This brings the response rate for the year down to 6.1% with 20 responses out of 327 sent. In prior years the rate has fluctuated from period to period, but this is more significant. Given the low response rate, results should not be considered representative of the population of workplace monitors. Report continues next page Attachment #7 July 2021 - Year 11 Annual Report 13Professional Licensing Board Question 1: Respondents are first asked which professional board licenses the employee they monitor. This period, three were licensed by the Medical Board, one by the Board of Nursing and one was not identified. For the year, the pattern more closely matches enrollment with 40% licensed by the Board of Nursing (8), 35% by the Medical Board (7), and 5% (1) each by the Boards of Pharmacy and Dentistry. There were also three not identified for the year. As a point of comparison, the percentage of participating licensees from each board is: Medical - 48%, Nursing - 34%, Dental - 7%, and Pharmacy - 11%.

How satisfied are you with our support?\" This year, all respondents except one were satisfied with IBH's support. In fact, 45% (9) were \"very satisfied,\" while the mode response was \"satisfied\" with 50%. The mode for the period, however, was \"very satisfied\" at 60% (3). Data Table 3: The mode (most frequent) response is in red: Table 3: Supervision Support This Period (n=5) Year 11 (n=20) Year 10 (n=60) # % # % # % Very Satisfied 3 60% 9 45% 37 61.7% Satisfied 2 40% 10 36.7% Unsatisfied 1 5% Very Unsatisfied 1 1.7% No Response Attachment #7 July 2021 - Year 11 Annual Report 14Workplace Safety Question 3: IBH's ability to monitor the licensee to ensure safety in the workplace is queried in the next item. This is one of HPSP's most vital functions so it is important to note that responses are primarily positive. In fact, for the period, 100% of respondents rated this \"excellent.\" For the year, the largest group of respondents (45% or 9) rated it \"excellent.\" This is followed by \"above average\" (30% or 6) and then \"average\" (15% or 3). If we remove the one individual who chose not to respond to this item, then we find that 18 out of 19, or 95%, of respondents rated IBH's as able to ensure safety in the workplace. Data Table 4: The mode (most frequent) response is highlighted in red: A follow-up question requests any suggested changes or recommendations. None were provided this period. Services Question 4: Respondents are asked to think about their recent contacts with IBH and rate the following: response timeframe, knowledge of licensee when there is a concern in the workplace; ability to respond to questions regarding program administration; and frequency of feedback from IBH. Finally, an overall rating is requested. The mode response to each item was \"excellent\" this year, just like last year. Responses were positive overall with no \"poor\" ratings. In fact, there was only one \"below average\" rating which was to the overall rating item; this rating was provided by the same respondent who indicated s/he was \"unsatisfied\" with IBH's support. Despite that, 80% of respondents rated the program \"above average\" or \"excellent\" this year. Data for this period, this year and the prior year follows on the next page.

The mode response was \"excellent\" at 80% of respondents for the period and 60% for the year. Looking at the year data, an additional 15% (3) rated the program \"above average.\" In total this year, 95% rated the program \"average\" or better. The \"poor\" response was from the same respondent who gave the other noted negative responses on prior questions.

Spelling, punctuation, and grammar have not been corrected. 1. I think the weekly email requirement is silly but its probably a statutory requirement. No complaints overall 2. RBH should notify monitee when medical director decides to increase testing frequency of monitee. RBH could improve upon their efforts at locating out of town test sites (so that monitee does not have to make phone calls on their own to locate test sites that are within a reasonable traveling distance). Summary Analysis The response rate for this survey was extremely low, both for the period (3.1%) and the year (6.1%.) As such, results should be interpreted carefully as they may not be representative of the entire population. That said, the breakdown by board of those who responded (40% Board of Nursing, 35% Medical Board, 5% Board of Pharmacy and 5% Board of Dentistry) is similar to the licensee make-up of the program. Further, results are similar to those received in past years. Notably, 95% of respondents this year indicated that they are satisfied with IBH's support of their role as workplace monitor. Equally important, 95% of respondents who provided a rating indicated that IBH is able to ensure safety in the workplace. The largest group of respondents rated IBH's response timeframe, knowledge of licensees, ability to respond to questions regarding program administration and frequency of feedback as \"excellent.\" HPSP's overall services were rated as \"excellent\" or \"above average\" by 80% of respondents this year. In total, 95% of respondents rated their overall experience working with IBH positively, with 60% rating it \"excellent.\" The PAC committee will review the survey data and the comments carefully. Attachment #7 July 2021 - Year 11 Annual Report 17IBH Solutions Health Professionals' Services Program (HPSP) Satisfaction of PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS Purpose The purpose of assessing representatives from the related professional associations is to obtain constructive feedback that can be used to improve and maintain the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of HPSP. In order to provide continuous quality services, IBH evaluates this stakeholder group's satisfaction with HPSP twice yearly. Feedback is obtained from Association representatives via a satisfaction survey that is emailed to representatives who are asked to complete the survey online. The survey is short and can be completed in 2-3 minutes. Feedback includes information about the timeliness of response, knowledge level of staff, ability to enroll licensees and an overall rating of IBH services. Also, the survey asks about the value of HPSP to their membership and asks for any additional comments. One method of determining the value of HPSP is through the Satisfaction Survey. One of the roles of the IBH Policy Advisory Committee (PAC) is that of quality management. Following review of the survey results, the PAC will identify opportunities for improvement and develop interventions if necessary. The PAC will continue to monitor performance at specified intervals following the implementation of the intervention(s). Data Results Response Rate Table 1: Response Rate This Period Year 11 Year 10 Year 9 Year 8 Year 7 # Sent 11 16 10 10 8 8 # Responses 3 3 0 2 1 1 Response Rate 27.3% 18.8% 0% 20.0% 12.5% 12.5% Eleven surveys were sent out this period to various contacts at related professional associations and three were returned, for a response rate of 27.3%. This brings the response rate for the year to 18.8%, representing three responses out of 16 surveys sent. IBH worked diligently in the spring to hold conversations with the various professional associations. These efforts will continue. A breakdown of the associations surveys this period and last period follows: This Period (July) Last Period (January) Oregon Dental Association ODA 2 1 Oregon Medical Association OMA 1 1 Oregon Pharmacy Association OPA 1 1 Oregon Nurses Association ONA 2 1 Oregon Pharmacists Recovery Network P.R.N. 1 Oregon Association of Nurse Anesthetists ORANA 1 Oregon Center for Nursing OCN 1 Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems OAHHS 2 Oregon Psychiatric Physician's Association OPPA 1 Attachment #7 July 2021 - Year 11 Annual Report 18 Associated Board Question 1: The first question asks the respondents which board the associations' members are licensed by. The three respondents indicated the following boards: Medical Board, Nursing Board and Pharmacy Board. Customer Service Question 2: Respondents are then asked to \"Please think about your recent contact with IBH and rate\" the 1) timeliness of HPSP's response, 2) the knowledge level of HPSP's staff and 3) HPSP's services overall. A scale of \"excellent\" to \"poor\" is provided. One respondent rated all three items as \"excellent\" and the second rated them all \"above average.\" The third respondent indicated that these items were \"not applicable\" meaning that s/he had not initiated a request to HPSP. Value to Members Question 3: Next, the question \"How valuable is the Health Professionals' Services Program to your membership?\" is asked. A four-point scale ranging from \"extremely valuable\" to \"extremely unvaluable\" is provided. Two respondents indicated that HPSP is \"valuable\" for members and one indicated it is \"extremely valuable.\" Question 4: The last survey question asks the respondent to rate the feedback received from membership regarding IBH on a five-point scale ranging from \"excellent\" to \"poor.\" Two respondents endorsed that feedback has been \"above average\" and the third selected \"not applicable\" meaning that s/he had not received any feedback. Respondents are then asked for any additional comments. One (1) was provided: 1. We are glad to keep in contact about ongoing development HPSP services in order to provide an accessible and safe space for licensees in need of such services. Summary Analysis Three responses from contacts at the various professional associations were received, one each from an association related to the Nursing, Medical and Pharmacy Board. Responses were positive, indicating that services were \"excellent\" (1) or \"above average\" (1). Further, responses indicated that HPSP is \"valuable\" (2) or \"extremely valuable\" (1) for members. Feedback from membership has been \"very good\" (2.) IBH's efforts this spring to communicate with the various professional associations is already proving fruitful. Additional conversations are planned for the upcoming months. Attachment #7 July 2021 - Year 11 Annual Report 19IBH Solutions Health Professionals' Services Program (HPSP) Satisfaction of PROVIDERS Purpose The purpose of assessing GMC/PMC providers and third-party evaluators is to solicit feedback that can be used to improve the services provided through HPSP. IBH strives to maintain the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of the program, and evaluates these providers' satisfaction with HPSP twice yearly. Feedback is obtained from these providers via a satisfaction survey that is emailed. The survey is short and can be completed in 2-3 minutes. Feedback includes information about IBH's communication, responsiveness of staff, overall rating of experience, and any additional comments. One method of determining the value of HPSP is through the Satisfaction Survey. One of the roles of the IBH Policy Advisory Committee (PAC) is that of quality management. Following review of the survey results, the PAC will identify opportunities for improvement and develop interventions if necessary. The PAC will continue to monitor performance at specified intervals following the implementation of the intervention(s). Data Results Response Rate Table 1: Response Rate This Period Year 11 Year 10 Year 9 Year 8 # Sent 22 48 51 52 52 # Responses 7 12 10 11 14 Response Rate 31.8% 25.0% 19.6% 21.2% 26.9% Surveys were sent to 9 GMC/PMC providers and 13 third-party evaluators by email this period, for a total of 22 surveys distributed. Seven responses were received for a rate of 31.8%. For the year, the response rate is 25%, representing 12 responses to the 48 surveys that were sent. These rates represent an increase from the prior two years. Role of Respondent The first question asks the respondents the capacity in which they provide services to HPSP licensees. This period, three respondents indicated they serve as an \"evaluator\" and three as a \"monitor\" (GMC/PMC). The final respondent indicated they serve as both. For the year, five identified as an \"evaluator,\" six as a \"monitor\" and one as both. Two also identified as a treatment provider/therapist. Report continues next page Attachment #7 July 2021 - Year 11 Annual Report 20 Customer Service and Communication Question 2: Survey respondents are asked to rate three different statements relating to communication between HPSP and the provider. Specifically, they were asked if questions and concerns were responded to promptly, information was communicated clearly and professionally, and if they had all the necessary information when they met with the licensee. For the period, the mode was \"agree\" for the first two statements and \"strongly agree\" for the third. Two respondents did not feel they had all the information needed when they met with the licensee, but otherwise each of the statements was universally positively endorsed. This was also true for the year: Responses were split evenly between \"strongly agree\" and \"agree\" for questions being answered promptly and information being communicated clearly and professionally. The mode for having all information needed when seeing the licensee was \"strongly agree\" for the year, although there were those two \"disagree\" responses mentioned earlier. Overall, responses were more positive this year than last year with a greater percentage of \"strongly agree\" responses to each of the three items.

Great program & staff! Summary Analysis The response rate was 31.8% for the period and 25% for the year. These rates represent an increase from the prior two years. There was a balanced set of responses each from evaluators and monitors both this period and year. Overall, responses were positive throughout the year and improved from last year. Responses were split evenly between \"strongly agree\" and \"agree\" for questions being answered promptly and information being communicated clearly and professionally. The mode for having all information needed when seeing the licensee was \"strongly agree.\" When rating their experience working with the IBH staff of HPSP, the mode response for the year was \"excellent\" with half (50% or six) of the responses. There was one \"average\" response for the year, but the remainder were \"above average.\" Six comments were received: Three were positive, one expressed a concern and two provided recommendations. The PAC will review all survey data and comments. Attachment #7 Health Professionals' Services Program Summary Annual Report Highlights of Year Eleven 7/1/20-6/30/ 21 The purpose of this report is to provide a summary of the highlights of the eleventh year of the Health Professionals' Services Program (HPSP) to the re presentatives of the participating health licensing boards . HPSP began provision of monitoring services to the Oregon Board of Dentistry, Oregon Board of Nursing, Oregon Medical Board, and the Oregon Board of Pharmacy on July 1, 2010 . The Oregon Health Au thority previously oversaw HPSP's provision of services to the boards . The following data tables were developed to give an overview of the HPSP program during the period from July 1, 20 20 through Jun e 30, 2021. Table 1: Enrollment Overview : Year 11 Enrollment Overview: Year 11 (7/1/20 - 6/30/21) Board of Dentistry Board of Nursing Board of Pharmacy Medical Board TOTAL Total Enrolled End of Year 10 (6/30/20) 12 74 20 100 206 Enrolled: Board Referral* 3 16 2 7 28 Enrolled: Self -Referral* 0 2 0 6 8 Successfully Completed 2 18 1 20 41 Terminations 1 12 2 6 21 Total Enrolled End of Year 1 1 (6/30/20) 12 62 19 87 180 Referred but Not Enrolled/Inquiry Only 0 1 0 3 4 *Referral Type at the time of enrollment Table 1 provides a summary of year eleven enrollment , beginning with the number of licensees enrolled at the end of year ten and reviewing the changes in enrollment during the year. I n particular, it displays : the number of licensees referred by the licensing board to the program, the number of se lf-referrals to the progr am, the number of licensees who suc cessfully completed the program , and the number of licensees who were terminated from the program by the licensing boards. T he total enrollees at the end of year eleven follows from this data. T able 1 also displays the number of licensees who did not yet enroll but were referred or self-initiated contact with the program prior to the end of the year . Table 2 provides the same information but for year ten enrollment (se e next page) . At the end o f year eleven , the program had 180 participants , a 12.6% decrease from the 206 participants at the beginning of the year. Total enrollment decreased because the number of completions (41) and terminations (21) when combined (62), was greater than the 36 ne w enrollees (28 board referrals plus 8 self -referrals). The total completions and terminations this year (6 2) is comparable to those last year ( 36+25 = 61), however the new referrals were far greater last year ( 47) than this year ( 36). The impact o f COVID should be considered when reflecting on this decrease. Although not solely responsible, the change in business practices for the year ce rtainly was felt. Meanwhile, we know that mental health across our nation suffered throughout the pandemic and substance use (and abuse) increased. To reflect this, we should expect a higher referral rate in the year ahead . Attachment #7 It is important to note that the number of completions is nearly double that of the number of terminations, underlining the success of the program . All four boards had licensees both successfully complet e and end the program as terminations. There were also new board r eferrals by all four boards, with self -referrals by the Board of Nursing ( 2) and Medical Board (6.) This volume of self -referrals is up 2 cases from the 6 self-referrals last year.

To date, 1 ,044 licensees have enrolled, and 531 of these have completed; an additional 180 are on track to complete for a total of 68%. The percentage successful ranges across the Boards from 59.4% (Boa rd of Nursing ), to 75% (Board of Dentistry and Board of Pharmacy) to 81% (Medical Board.) Unfortunately, 333 licensees have been terminated. These case s include situations where HPSP and the Boards acted to protect public safety. IBH would like to discuss adding peer support as an element for the Board of Nursing specifically. This is something that the Medical Board participants engage in a nd it has bee n empirically proven to increase success in monitoring programs. Attachment #7 Table 4: Video/ In-Person Contacts Video/ In-Person Contacts: Year 11 Board of Dentistry Board of Nursing Board of Pharmacy Medical Board TOTAL Number of Video/ In-Person Conta cts (including Intakes) 7 13 Number of Video/ In-Person Intakes 0 3 0 2 5 Total Enrolled During Year 11 3 18 2 13 36 Percent with Video/ In-Person HPSP met via video conference with a total o f 13 licensee s, five for intakes and the other eight for annual reviews . The Medical Board had seven licensees meet with their agreement monitor via video conference and the Board of Nursing had six. The video conference intakes account for ~14% of the intakes complet ed during year eleven ; up from 4% last year . IBH was pleased to begin offering the video conference option this year and will continue to do so even after COVID restrictions lift for those who cannot make it to our office . In fact, licensees are offere d an in -person or video option for annual reviews and intakes at this time. Please note that in some cases it is not appropriate or helpful, so it may not be universally offered.

Please note that a licensee must be enrolled in order to be considered terminated from the program , thus ca ses closed as a \"failure to enroll \" are not captured in table four . A total of 21 licens ees were terminated from the program in year eleven , compared to 25 last year. A total of six Medical Board licensees were terminated , all due to surrendered licenses . The Board of Nursing had 12 terminations : four due to surrendered licenses, five due to probation , two due to a revoked license and one due to an inactivated license . Two Board of Pharmacy licensee s were terminated this year , both due to a surrendered l icense. One licensee from the Board of Dentistr y is now deceased and is thus no longer able to participate in the program. Surrendering one's license was the most common reason for termination from the program in year eleven , as it was for most of the prior years of the program.

This includes those who were suspended as well as those who were not actually suspended but are formally not participating . Reasons for suspension were varied : For the Board of Nursing, one was suspended due to severe health issues and four were formally not participating (but not suspended ). The Medical Board had one licensee suspended due to financial non- compliance and one due to incarceration. Neither t he Board of Pharmacy nor the Board of Dentistry had any licensees suspended or formally not participating this year . By the close of the eleventh program year, there was on ly one licensee formally not participating (see Table 6 below. ) This licensee from the Medic al Board is suspended due to incarceration .

A break -down of these reports is then listed, showing the number of licensee s who received reports, the number with more than one report throughout the year , and the number with more than three reports throughout the year . Further, the number of licensees with a non -compliance report is reflected as a percentage of the average nu mber of licensees enrolled in the program. This figure was 28.5% for year eleven , meaning that just more than a quarter of licensees had a non -compliance report at some point during the year. This figure is down from 34.3% the prior year . This figure ranged from 41.2% (Board of Nursing) to 20.3% (Medical Board) . A total of 55 licensees had one or more non-complian ce report s this year, a decrease from 73 last year . A total of 167 non-compliance reports were submitted this year , also a decrease from the 227 last year. The Board of Nursing licensees had 105 reports this year ; 51 of these, though, were for four licensees. The Medical Board had 41 non-compliant reports this year, the Board of Pharmacy had 16 and the Board of Dentistry had five (5) . Thirteen licensees across all four boards had more than three non -compliant reports submitted , ranging from no (0) Board of Dentistry licensee s to eight ( 8) Board of Nursing licensees. The total number of non -compliance reports submitted as a percentage of the average number of enrolled licensees was 86.5% , a strong decrease from last year's 106.6%. It is important to remember that this decrease in non -comp liance occurred during a year characterized by the stress of managing the pandemic. While individual's daily live s were characterized by increased stress, loss of structure and significant change , enrolled licensees were able to continue in their sobriety due in part to the structure and accountability of HPSP.

Table 9 shows the number of self-referred licensees who were reported non -compliant and are thus now known to the board. This year, both the Medical Board and Board of Nursing had two self-referrals who switched to being board known . The Board of Dentistry and Board of Pharmacy did not h ave any; t his is expected given that they did not have any self -referrals participating at any point during year eleven .

It is not uncommon for a single non -compliance report to have multiple reasons for the non -compliance; all of these reasons are captured in the table . The most common reason for non -compliance was the licensee f ailing to test as scheduled . This was the ca se on 92 reports, down from 128 last year. Failure to test has been the most frequent reason for a non -compliance report for the past eight years. Missed IVR calls, positive toxicology tests , missed agreement m onitor check -ins and \"failure to participate: other\" were the next most common reasons . For the last three years these reasons have continued to be the most frequent in various orders . Note that \"missed IVR calls\" (or any missed check -in to the testing n otification system) is only reported in conjunction with another non -compliance instance, like a missed test. There are not any particularly notable differences between the boards. With the greater total number of reports, the Boa rd of Nursing does have m ore reasons for non -compliance than the other boards. Attachment #7Table 1 1: Non -Negative Toxicology Tests Non-Negative Toxicology Tests: Year 11 Board of Dentistry Board of Nursing Board of Pharmacy Medical Board TOTAL Invalid Tests 0 17 5 16 38 Positive Tests (non -negative results) 3 32 2 17 54 Total Non -Negative Tests (Positive + Invalid) 3 49 7 33 92 Positive Tests as a Percentage of Average # of Licensees Enrolled in Year 11 25.0% 47.1% 10.3% 18.2% 28.0% Number of Licensees with a Test 2 13 2 4 21 Number of Licensees with a Positive Test as a Percentage of Average # of Licensees Enrolled in Year 11 16.7% 19.1% 10.3% 4.3% 10.9% Table 11 shows the number of invalid and positive toxicology tests per board. These include urinalysis (UA), hair , and blood tests. The non -negative results include re -test results , but if the specimens were also either positive or invalid on the original toxicology screen , they were only counted once each. This year a total of 38 tests were invalid . IBH has continued to work closely with the forensic scientists and other experts at Medtox/Labcorp regarding the volume of invalid results across our customers. We are pleased to report that Medtox/Labcorp implemented a change to address this issue earlier this month and we are already seeing a decrease in the number of invalids. With this change in place , examples of problems moving forward that may cause an invalid test result include large amounts of particulates like blood in the sample, substituting another liquid fo r the urine sample , or adulterating the sample with some type of additive that interferes with the processing of the result . There were a total of 54 positive toxicology tests during year eleven , similar to 52 last year . Thirty -two of these were from the B oard of Nursing, 17 from the Medical Board , two from the Board of Pharmacy and three from the Board of Dentistry. Table 1 1 also reflects t he number of positive tests as a percentage of the average number of licensees enrolled in the program during year eleven . Overall the positive tests are 28% of the average number of enrolled licensees, a slight increase from last year's 24%. The boards ranged from a low of 10.3% (Board of Pharmacy) to a high of 47.1% (Board of Nursing ). This percentage (positive test s relative to average number of enrolled licensees) is impacted by the numb er of licensees with more than one positive test. Thus, Table 9 also include s the numb er of licensees with a positive test. This number is then reflected as a percentage of the av erage number of licensees enrolled in the program. Across the program, the percentage of licensees with a positive test is 10.9%, down from 13.6% last year and 15.6% two years ago. The Board of Nursing's percentage is 1 9.1% based on 1 3 licensees with posi tive tests. This is followed by the Board of Dentistry with 16 .7% (2 licensees), then the Board of Pharmacy with 10.3% (2 licensees) and finally the Medical Board with 4.3% (4 licensees) . Attachment #7Table 1 2: Drugs Resulting in Positive Tests Drugs Resulting in Po sitive Tests: Year 11 Board of Dentistry Board of Nursing Board of Pharmacy Medical Board TOTAL amphetamines / methamphetamines 1 1 5 7 cocaine metabolite 1 1 2 ethyl glucuronide (ETG) 15 1 9 9 2 3 10 15 opioids (narcotics/opiates) 3 3 TOTAL 3 32 2 17 54 Number of Licensees with a Positive Test 2 13 2 4 21 Table 12 shows the various drugs that resulted in a positive test result. This table only include s the drugs resulting in the positive test , excluding any substances excused by the MRO . As we have seen historically, the largest number of positive tests was for alcohol (ethyl glucuronide (ETG) ). This year positive ETG tests accounted for 33.3% of the positive te sts (18 positives ). Alcohol metabolites identified through a PEth (blood) test rather than a urine toxicology screen a lso a ccount ed for an additional 16.7% of the positive tests (9). Thus , half (50% or 27) of the positive tests were due to alcohol consum ption. The next most frequently found substance this year was marijuana metabolite with 27.8% of the positives (15 tests ). This category only accounted for 2.8% of the positive tests last year. That said, two licensees were responsible for 9 of the 15 positives for marijuana metabolite . Table 13: Missed Test Details - Breakdown by Reason Missed Test Breakdown by Reason: Year 11 Board of Dentistry Board of Nursing Board of Pharmacy Medical Board TOTAL No Call 1 68 14 11 94 No Show 0 26 1 4 31 Refused 0 1 0 1 2 TOTAL 1 95 15 16 127 Table 1 3 gives detail s on licensees who failed to take a scheduled toxicology test. No call refers to licensees who failed to check in to the daily testing notification system (IVR/portal/app) and did not test as scheduled . No Show refers to situations when the licensee did not go to the collection site to give a specim en but did check to see if a test was required through the daily testing notification system (IVR/portal/app) . Refused refers to li censees who went to the co llection site but did not provide an adequate specimen. This is considered a refusal to test which is treated like a positive test unless the licensee can provide a medical explanation from a physician, verifying that the licensee has a medical condition w hich prevents the licensee from providing an adequate sample . There were two \"refusals\" this year , one from the Board of Nursing and one from the Medical Board . There was a total of 127 missed tests this year compared to 139 last year . The majori ty (94) of misses were due to No Call while 31 were due to No Show. This means that more licensees missed a test after failing to check -in than did not test despite apparent knowledge of the requirement to do so. In total, n inety -five of the missed tests were missed by Board of Nursing licensees, 16 by Medical Board lic ensees, 16 by Board of Pharmacy licensees and 1 by the Board of Dentistry licensees. Although there were 127 missed tests, note that Attachment #7there are only 92 non-compliance reports related to missed t ests. In some cases, reports were not required because the license had already been terminated or suspended before the issue was confirmed and in other cases because the licensee was on \"periodic non -compliance reports\" and thus multiple missed tests were reported on one non -compliance report. Table 14: Missed Te st Details - By Licensees Missed Test Details: Year 11 Board of Dentistry Board of Nursing Board of Pharmacy Medical Board TOTAL Total Number of Missed Tests 1 95 15 16 127 Number of Licensees w ith a Missed Test 1 18 4 12 35 Licensees with a Missed Test as a Percentage of Average # of Licensees Enrolled in Year 11 8.3% 26.5% 20.5% 12.8% 18.1% Table 1 4 shows the total number of missed tests (also reported in Table 1 3) as compared to the number of unique licensees who missed a scheduled toxicology test. If these numbers were identical, it would mean that each licensee was only responsible for one missed test. The larger the difference in these numbers, the more times a single licensee is respon sible for multiple missed tests. This year, 35 licensees were responsible for the 127 missed tests, an average of approximately 3.5 missed tests per licensee. In fact , though f our (4) licensees were responsible for just over half of the missed tests. Table 1 4 also shows the number of missed tests as a percentage of the average number of licensees enr olled in year eleven . Across the boards , this p ercentage was 18.1%. The Board of Nursing was highest with 26.5%, meaning that about a quarter of licensees missed at l east one test. The Board of Pharmacy had 20.5% of licensees miss a test (1 in 5 licensees missed a test) , the Board of Dentistry had 8.3% (1 in 15 licensees) and the Medical Board had 12. 8% (1 in 8 licensees) .

This year, an average of 92.1% of the required reports were received with a total of 1,734 reports received and carefully reviewed for 183 licensees. HPSP will continue to employ the tools that are in place to carefully track and follow -up on these reports each month. Table 1 5 additionally d isplays the number and percentage of reports in which the workplace monitor noted concerns about the licensee in the workplace. There were only eight (8) such reports this year, with four each from licensees of the Board of Nursing and the Medical Board. The Boards of Dentistry and Pharmacy did not have any such reports this year. It is important to note that 100% of the reports with a concern no ted had an appropriate plan developed and put into place to address the concerns. Further display ed in Table 1 5 is the n umber of licensees with a report indicating concerns who also had a non -compliance report. In fact, two-thirds (4) of the ( 6) license es with a workplace concern noted did have a non -compliance report on record. Finally, Table 1 5 displays the number of licensees with a workplace safe practice report noting concerns and a non-compliance report as a percentage of the total number of licens ees with a non -compliance report. This figure was 10.5% for the Medical Board and 7.1% for the Board of Nursing. Again, these licensees with a non -compliance report displayed concerning behavior in the workplace . This emphasizes the importance , and effe ctiveness, of monitoring. Attachment #7What's Next? Year Twelve It is important to note that th e COVID -19 pandemic was in effect during the entirety of this reporting year , which presented unique challenges to the monitoring program and certainly healthcare in gene ral. We were pleased to see that the structure, support, and accountability of monitor ing allowed licensees to be as successful as in past years. However, we do anticipate that this coming year will be more difficult for licensees to navigate as the trauma response reaction will likely lead to increased need for support and resources. We also anticipate an increase in referrals across all boards as healthcare providers who have been s truggling with substance use and mental health symptoms during the pandemi c will be identifie d. Looking ahead to next year, the HPSP team will focus on: Continued relationship building with professional associations, including O regon Nurses Association (ONA) , Oregon Medical Association (OMA) , Oregon Association of Nurse tists (ORANA) , Oregon Podiatric Medicine Association (OPMA) , Oregon Dental Association (ODA), Oregon Pharmacy Association (OPA) and Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems (OAHHS) . Continue to offer and encourage in -person (when appropriate) and video contacts between Agreement Monitors and licensees . Continue to educate licensees, associations, and treatment providers about the licensee opportunities and advantages of self -referral . Meet with staff from each board to discuss board -specific issue s and initiatives, and how to work collaboratively to increase licensees' successful completion from HPSP . Kate Manelis, L MSW, HPSP Program Manager July 22, 202 1 Attachment #7 IBH Monitoring Health Professionals' Services Program (HPSP) Enrollment Survey Report July 20 20 Purpose In February of 2018, IBH Monitoring introduced a new survey that reviews the enrollment process. Enrollment Surveys are distributed in the fourth month after a licensee successfully enroll ed in the Health Professionals' Services Program (HPSP). HPSP recognizes the significant importance of the enrollment process. Licensees need to receive an extensive amount of information and to develop a clear understanding of the expectations placed on them while they are participating in HPSP . The better their understanding of the expectations and the systems available to support them, the more successful they will be. The purpose of the Enrollment Survey is to gather information about each licensee's experience s during enrollment in order to help IBH evaluate the effectiveness of, and the clarity of communications during , the enrollment process. Surveys are distributed via email. Li censees are asked to follow the included link to access and complete the survey. Requested feedback covers methods of communication used during enrollment, the quality (clarity, consistency and timeliness) of that communication, and staff's helpfulness. The quality of the relationship with their agreement monitor is also queried. If the licensee met with the ir agreement monitor in perso n for an intake, feedback is requested on the helpfulness of that encounter. At the conclusion of the survey, licensees are asked to provide any other feedback on the process. Response Rate Between July 20 20 and June 2021 (\"Program Year Eleven \"), the Enro llment Survey was distributed to 32 licensees who enrolled in the pr ogram between March 1, 2020 and February 28 , 2021. Note that responses are recorded based on when they are received rather than when the survey was sent. Eight (8) responses were received during the year, resulting in a 25.0% response rate. This i s within the range of the previous response rates. Table 1: Response Rate Program Year 11 Program Year 10 Program Year 9 # Sent 32 57 29 # Returned 8 18 8 Response Rate 25.0% 31.6% 27.6% Attachment #7 Data Results Mode responses (the most frequent response in each dataset ) are in red, excluding N/A responses. Not all items have a mode response. Note that comments are shown as the respondent typed or wrote them: Spelling, punctuation, and grammar have not been corrected. Communication The first three questions query the methods, quality, quantity , and timeliness of communication during the enrollment process. Question 1 - Methods of Communication Licensees are first asked to indicate which ways they receive d information about the program during the enrollment process . The number of methods a licensee can list is not limited. This year, the eight licensees listed a total of 12 methods. Phone calls (7 or 87.5%) and email (5 or 62.5%) were the communication methods listed . Although not listed in their responses, l icensees are all referred to our website to access guidelines and other information. When asked, licensees did not recommend any other methods of communicating information about the program during the enrollment p rocess Table 2: Methods of Communication Program Year 11 (n=12) Program Year 10 (n=18) # % # % In person 3 16.7% Website 6 33.3% Email 5 62.5% 14 77.8% Phone Call 7 87.5% 16 88.9% Mail 5 27.8% Report continues on the next page Attachment #7Question 2 - Quantity and Quality of Communication Licensees are next asked if they received all the necessary information to understand the program requirements and if it was clear, concise and consistent. A scale of \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagre e\" is used. This of responses were either \"strongly agree\" or \"agree\" to all four items. The mode response to the first item, having received all the information needed, was \"agree.\" The mode response to the other three items, that the infor mation was clear, concise and consistent, was \"strongly agree.\" Licensees are given the option to \"provide any recommendations related to providing information to new enrollees .\" Two comments were provided : 1. I was asking about specific situations relating to my very rural location and somewhat unique situation. I received some conflicting information but it was resolved soon after. I also like to ask a lot of questions so I do not break any of the rules. 2. I am a participant and concurrent enrollee in HPSP and 3 other start equivalents. HPSP was by far the most user friendly and humanistic. Data from this year is provided below, followe d by da ta from last year on the next page . Response trends were more positive this year than last, reflecting the efforts made by the IBH team to improve the enrollment experience. Table 3a: Quantity and Quality of Communication - Year 11 (n=8) Strongly Agree Agree Neither Agree Nor Disagree Disagree Strongly Disagree N/A or No Response # % # % # % # % # % # % I received all the information I need/needed about the program to understand the requirements. 3 37.5% 4 50.0% 1 12.5% The information I received was clear. 4 50.0% 3 37.5% 1 12.5% The information I received was concise. 4 50.0% 3 37.5% 1 12.5% The information I received was consistent. 4 50.0% 3 37.5% 1 12.5% Attachment #7 Table 3b: Quantity and Quality of Communication - Year 10 (n=18) Strongly Agree Agree Neither Agree Nor Disagree Disagree Strongly Disagree N/A or No Response # % # % # % # % # % # % I received all the information I need/needed about the program to understand the requirements. 2 11.1% 10 55.6% 4 22.2% 2 11.1% The information I received was clear. 4 22.2% 8 44.4% 4 22.2% 2 11.1% The information I received was concise. 3 16.7% 6 33.3% 3 16.7% 3 16.7% 3 16.7% The information I received was consistent. 3 16.7% 7 38.9% 3 16.7% 2 11.1% 3 16.7% Question 3 - Timeliness of Information As a final question regarding communication, l icensees are asked to rate the timeliness of the provision of the information during the enrollment process. All but one respondent ( 7 or 87.5%) felt that information was provided at just the right pace, while one (12.5%) felt that they needed more information sooner. No responses were provided to the question \" Please provide any recommendations related to providing information to new enrollees .\" Table 4: Timeliness of Information Year 11 (n=8) Year 10 (n=18) # % # % Too Fast to Process 1 5.6% Just Right 7 87.5% 12 66.7% Too Slow - I needed more information sooner 1 12.5% 5 27.8% Report continues on the next page Attachment #7IBH Staff Members The next three questions relate to the licensees ' interactions with IBH staff members. Question 4 - Helpfulness of Staff Licensees are asked how helpful staff members are and responses were all positive . All respondents rated their agreement monitor \"very good\" in terms of helpfulness . Over half (5 or 62.5%) also rated the administrative team \"very good\" while the others (3 or 37.5%) rated the team \"good.\" No additional comment s were provided .

Due to the COVID pandemic, no in -person intakes have been provided in the last 18 months. IBH began a pilot study offering a video conference intake meeting for licensees with their Agreement Monitor during the fall of 2020 . This became common practice by spring of 2021 . Thus, many of the licensees surveyed in this report did not have an option for a video -conference meeting or an in -person intake due to COVID. One l icensee indicated that they did have a video -conference meeting this year. This individual did not feel it changed their enrollment experience. Table 6: In -Person / Video Conference Meeting with Agreement Monitor Program Year 11 (n=1) Program Year 10 (n=3) # % # % It significantly improved my enrollment experience. 2 66.7% It partially improved my enrollment experience. 1 33.3% It did not change my enrollment experience. 1 100% It degraded my enrollment experience. It significantly degraded my enrollment experience. Question 6 - Relationship with Agreement Monitor The next item asks respondents to rate their agreement with the following statement \" I have developed a strong working relationship with my Agreement Monitor. \" Notably, 87.5% (7) of the respondents indicated that they \"strongly agree\" or \"agree\" with this statement . The other respondent (1 or 12.5%) selected the response \"neither agree nor disagree.\" Table 7: Strong Working Relationship with Agreement Monitor Program Year 11 (n=8) Program Year 10 (n=18) # % # % Strongly Agree 3 37.5% 6 33.3% Agree 4 50.0% 8 44.4% Neither Agree Nor Disagree 1 12.5% 4 22.2% Disagree Strongly Disagree One comment was provided: 1. She is a very caring and compassionate person, which has been very helpful in my recovery. Attachment #7Characteristics of Responde nt Pool Question 7: Board Licensing Respondent s Of the 32 enrollees who were sent survey s this year: 14 (43.8%) were licensed by the Board of Nursing ; 14 (43.8%) by the Oregon Medical Board ; 2 (6.3%) by the Board of Pharmacy ; and 2 (6.3%) by the Board of Dentistry . Of these 32 enrollees , the 8 respondents indicated that they were licensed by the Medical Board (4 or 50%), the Board of Nursing (3 or 37.%) and the Board of Dentistry (1 or 12.5%). We can calculate a response rate by board and compare it to the 25% response rate overall : The Board of Dentistry had a 50% response rate ( 1 responder out of 2 survey recipien t). The Medical Board's response rate was 28.6% (4 responders out of 14 survey recipients). The Board of Nursing's rate was 21.4% (3 responders out of 28 survey recipients). The Board of Pharmacy's rate was 0% (0 responders out of 2 survey recipient s). Question 8: Comments The final question asks respondents to \" provide any comments on the enrollment process (e.g. What was most helpful? What do you wish was done differently?) \" Two responses were received: 1. The kindness and compassion of everyone at HPSP has helped reduce my anxiety during an emotionally difficult time. Thank you all. 2. Having the scheduled phone interview with the agreement monitor was much preferred over a prolonged email exchange. Summary Surveys were sent to the thirty -two licensees who enrolled between March 1, 2020 and February 28, 20 21. Eight responses were received for a response rate of 25% . Respondents were licensed by the Board of Nursing, the Oregon Medical Board , and the Board of Dentistry . Licensees indicated learning about the program through both phone calls and email messages. All but one licensee (87.5%), \"agreed\" or \"strongly agreed\" that they received all needed information and that it was clear, concise and consistent. Further , 87.5 % felt that they received information at the right pace (neither too fast nor too slow.) All respondents rated their agreement monitor \"very good\" in terms of helpfulness. Over half (5 or 62.5%) also rated the administrative team \"very good\" while the o thers (3 or 37.5%) rated the team \"good.\" In addition , 87.5% (7) of the respondents indicated that they \"strongly agree\" or \"agree\" that they have developed a strong working relationship with their agreement monitor. Attachment #7One of the respondents reported a video c onference intake meeting with their Agreement Monitor but did not feel it changed the enrollment experience . A total of five comments were provided throughout the survey. Four were positive and 1 was neutral. The IBH PAC will review all of the survey data carefully, including each of the comments . After review, the IBH PAC will identify opportunities for improvement. Attachment #7 IBH Monitoring Health Professionals' Services Program (HPSP) Exit Interview Report Year 11: July 1, 20 20 - June 30, 20 21 Purpose Exit Interviews are conducted when a licensee successfully completes the Health Professionals' Services Program (HPSP). The purpose of the Exit Interview is to gather information about the licensee's experience as a participant and to help IBH M onitoring evaluate the importance and effectiveness of each aspect of the monitoring program. Exit Interviews are mailed to licensees giving them the option of completing the questions online or completing the enclosed Exit Interview and mailing it back to IBH Monit oring in the postage paid envelope. Requested feedback includes length of time in the program, their rating of the support systems that aided them in successful completion, their rating of their Agreement Monitor, Customer Service, and the Toxicology Progr am, and the value of the newsletter and website. The Exit Int erview also include s a series of outcome related items focusing on the workplace, personal life , and interpersonal relationships. An overall evaluation of the impact of participation in the prog ram is requested at the conclusion of the survey along with any comments. Response Rate The Exit Interview was distributed to 41 licensees who successfully completed the program between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 20 21. Note that responses are recorded based on when they are received rather than when the licensee completed. Thirteen (13) responses were received during the year, resul ting in a 31.7% response rate. This is very similar to last year's rate (31.4%) . Table 1: Response Rate Year 11 Year 10 Year 9 Year 8 Year 7 # Sent 41 35 41 46 42 # Returned 13 11 17 14 8 Response Rate 31.7% 31.4% 41.5% 30.4% 19.0% Attachment #7Data Results Mode responses (the most frequent response in each dataset ) are in red, excluding N/A responses. Not all items have a mode response. Note that comments are shown as the respondent typed or wrote them: Spelling, punctuation , and grammar have not been corrected. Characteristics of Responder Pool The first two questions give us a picture of the characteristics of the licensees who responded to the exit interview. Question 1 - Length of Time in Program Licensees are first ask ed to indicate how long they were enrolled in the program. Historically, responses have predominately been between three and five years. There was more variability this year with one-third (4 or 30.8%) of the answers being \"ap proximately 2 years\" and another 15.4% (2) being more than 5 years. Table 2: Length of Time in Program Year 11 (n=1 3) Year 10 (n=1 1) # % # % Approximately 2 years 4 30.8% 1 9.1% Approximately 3 years Approximately 4 years 5 38.5% 6 54.6% Approximately 5 years 2 15.4% 4 36.4% More than 5 years (but not career length) 2 15.4% Career Length Report continues on the next page Attachment #7 Question 2: Board Licensing Respondent Of the 41 successful completers this year who received surveys: 18 (43.9%) were licensed by the Board of Nursing, 20 (48.8%) by the Oregon Medical Board, two (4.9%) by the Board of Dentistry and one (2.4%) by the Board of Pharmacy. Of the thirteen submitted survey responses : Seven of the respondents were licensed by the Board of Nursing (53.9%), four by the Oregon Medical Board ( 30.8%), and two by the Board of Dentistry (2 or 15.4%). There were not any respondents from the Board of Pharmacy but since there was only one completer from this board , it is not surprising. This data is reflected in Table 3. Table 3: Board Licensing Respondent Year 11 (n=1 3) Year 10 (n=1 1) # % # % Oregon Medical Board 4 30.8% 3 27.3% Board of Nursing 7 53.9% 6 54.6% Board of Dentistry 2 15.4% Board of Pharmacy 2 18.2% From this, we can calculate a response rate for each board and compare it to the 31. 7% overall response rate . Note that the extreme response rates for the Board of Dentistry and Board of Pharmacy simply reflect the small size of the surveyed population . Medical Board - 20.0% (4 responders out of 20 completers.) Board of Nursing - 38.9% (7 responders out of 18 completers.) Board of Dentistry - 100% (2 responders out of 2 completer s.) Board of Pharmacy - 0% (0 responders out of 1 completer.) Program Ratings The remainder of the survey questions ask responders to rate various aspects of the program and their impact on their personal and work life. Report continues on the next page Attachment #7Question 3 - Support Systems Question three asks respondents to rate the support systems that aided in their successful completion of the program. As data is examined, it will be helpful to know that one respondent to this survey responded with the most negative response option provi ded to these items and those throughout the rest of the survey and also expressed his/her dissatisfaction in negative comments throughout the survey as well.

Combining the responses is helpful in further analysis (see chart below). Doing so we find that this year responses were more strongly weighted on the \"Extremely Useful\" and \"Useful\" side for all components except the GMC/PMC components which were split evenly (1 on each side). Useful Unuseful/Extremely Unuseful Agreement 61.6% 15.4% 3rd Party Evaluations 46.2% 7.7% Additional comments about the support systems that aided in your successful completion: 1. I don't know the answer to this but I would have not been able to complete the program without the emotional support of family and friends. With that being said, if I hadn't been able to take a loan out, I couldn't have afforded the program. I don't know what nurses do that have no financial backing or emotional. I would not have been able to complete program. I personal know people who turned in their Attachment #7license as they couldn't afford it. Like I said, I don't know the answer, I know nurses need help to get healthy and give their best to their patients, and I thank you for that. 2. Absolutely no support was received.

In all then, 84.6% of rating s for agreement monitors were better than \"average.\" The remaining ratings were \"average\" (2 or 15.4%) . The mode response was \"excellent\" just like last year. Attachment #7 Customer service received a similar number of positive responses with 84.7% of responses either \"excellent\" or \"above average. \" However, t he mode response was \"above average\" (7 or 53.9%) , like last year. There was one additional response of \"average\" (7.7%) and one of \"below average (7.7%). Toxicology was rated positively by 61.6% ( 8) of respondents. The mode response was \"above average\" with five responses ; this is an improvement from last year . This year, t here were also three \"average\" responses (23.1%) but there were two \"below average\" responses. Last year's data is displayed below.

Like last year, ratings continue to be spread broadly . The mode response for both this year, however, was \"valuable .\" Efforts to enrich the newsletter were begun in the last 6 months and plans are in place to begin enhanc ing the website in the next year.

Specifically, the item states: \"Now that you have completed monitoring , please indicate the extent to which you agree or disagree with the following statements about your professional life.\" Notably, 87% of respondents are \"more satisfied with work ,\" with a mode response of \"agree.\" The item, \"I feel less stressed or burned out at work\" has a mode of \"strongly agree\" (5 or 38.5%) and a total 61. 6% of respondents who \"agree\" or \"strongly agree.\" Another 61.6% believe their \"work feels more meaningful.\" All of the \"strongly disagree\" responses were made by one individu al who was negative in tone throughout the survey. Data is more positive this year than it was last year. (Table 7b.)

Like last year, the mode response was \"I feel I am much better off than prior to my participation in HPSP.\" In total, 84.7% of participants feel better off than prior to participation. The one individual who \"strongly disagreed\" in questions 6 and 7 also here indicated feeling \"worse off\" and provided the 4th comment as listed on the next page.

I feel I am much worse than prior to my participation in HPSP. 1 7.7% Attachment #7 Pleas e expand on your response: 1. Rehab was very beneficial and the weekly group call ins. The toxicology program because of the randomness caused significant strain to my work duties. Regular testing at a more frequent interval would have been much more therapeutic. The toxicology progra m actually lead me to cancel operations for patients on the day of operation or leave them npo, leave patients waiting in the clinic for an extra hour or be canceled. I was always a low risk for use. Some other way to incorporate sobriety compliance would have been vastly beneficial and the program as organized caused significant work stress. 2. The coping skills that I have developed has helped me to cope in my everyday life. 3. I am definitely healthier and due to counseling outside of hpsp, I have dealt with a trauma that likely started that downhill slide. And I couldn't have got back to my feet without hpsp. 4. I am out literally thousands of dollars. The last 4 years made me feel like a [xxxx ] convict on parole (minus the GPS locater on a he ankle). The added stress level every single day this \"program\" added to my life probably aged me by a decade or more. My livelihood was threatened by your organization on multiple occasions and I feared for my ability to earn a living on a daily basis. 5. It was rather long. I feel like I could've been through at the 3 year mark. 6. Given the success of HPSP in relation to maintaining sobriety, monitoring is a must for health care providers. Additional Comments At the conclusion of the survey, respondents are asked to share any additional comments. The following were shared this year: 1. This entire process has made me a better person. The balance I have in my life has provided me with the ability to move forward on the goals I have for my life and my family. 2. In no way do es this program serve the public. The handful of people that participate at any given time is basically meaningless compared to the thousands of health care workers licensed in the state of Oregon. If anyone really gave a [xxxxx] about keeping the public s afe there would be a random testing requirement for all healthcare workers as part of licensing requirement. The military does it and guess what it works. The right thing will never be done because of the financial burden that would be involved. Typical! Summary The response rate for this year was 31. 7%, representing 13 respondents out of 41 licensees who completed the program this year . Licensees were enrolled for anywhere from two to more than five years, although most common response was four years. Response rates based on number of surveys sent to licensees of each board were: 2 0% Medical Board ( 4 responses), 3 8.9% Board of Nursing ( 7 responses) and 100% Board of Dentistry (2 responses.) The Board of Phar macy did not have any licensees respond to this survey this year, but only one Pharmacist complete d and thus receive d a survey this program year. Licensees are asked to rate the usefulness of a variety of support systems that they experienced while participating in HPSP. Program components were all rated primarily positive, with the exception of GMC and PMC participation for which the small sample of respondents were split in opinion. The mode for \"Regular contacts with agreement monitor\" and \"participat ing in random toxicology\" were tied between \" extremely Attachment #7useful \" and \" useful .\" \"Useful\" was the mode for \"having a monitoring agreement and addendums ,\" \"submitting documentation for requirements ,\" and \"attending evaluations by third party assessors.\" Overall, 85% of respondents rated their agreement monitor and customer service \"excellent' or \"above average .\" The mode response for agreement monitors was \"excellent\" and for customer service was \"above average.\" Toxicology was rated average or better by 85% of respondents and had a mode response of \"above average.\" Both the newsletter and the website were rated \"valuable\" by the largest group of respondents. That said, efforts to enrich the newsletter were begun in the last 6 months and pla ns are in place to begin enhancing the website in the next year. Respondents overall felt that the program had a positive impact on their professional, personal and interpersonal lives. In fact, there were not any more than two \"negative\" responses to a ny item and most only had one such response all made by the same person . Notably, 87 % of respondents are \"more satisfied with work ,\" and 62% are \"less stressed or burned out at work\" and believe their \"work feels more meaningful.\" Further, 77% felt that they were \"better able to cope with life changes\" and \"better equipped to manage [their] own health.\" And finally, 69% felt they have a work balance,\" are engaged in [their] \"more satisfied with [their] personal relationships, are \"better equipped to manage problems at home\" and have improved self -esteem. The final question asks, \"All things considered, how would you describe the impact of your participation in HPSP?\" Like last year, the mode response was \"I fe el I am much better off than prior to my participation in HPSP.\" In total, 85% of licensees thought they were better off after participating in HPSP. Ten (10) substantive responses were received throughout the survey. The IBH Monitoring PAC will review th e survey data along with each of the comments carefully. The IBH Monitoring PAC will then identify opportunities for improvement and develop interventions if necessary.

In 2017, the Oregon Medical Board, Dental Board, Board of Nursing, and Board of Pharmacy (\"the Boards\") collectively executed a master service contract (MSA) with Integrated Behavioral Health Solutions, LLC (IBH), to provide the following services: License e monitoring, including licensee enrollment and case monitoring, workplace monitoring and reporting, and random toxicology testing. Outreach and training to licensees, third -party evaluators, consultants, treatment providers, and licensee supervisors. Qual ity assessment and performance improvement, including establishing formal policies and procedures, required minimum staffing levels, obtaining and reporting licensee and stakeholder input, and performance measurement. Periodic reporting on licensee enrollm ent, compliance, and other factors. The Boards compensate IBH for these services ; each Board pay s a proportional share based on a formula accounting for total licensees and those licensees enrolled in the program. The Boards contracted with Sjoberg Evashen k Consulting to conduct an audit as required by ORS 676.190 (8). The audit scope required a Performance Audit over the course of 6 months and concluded on January 15, 2021 . The following is a summary of the audit's findings, recommendations, and results. Key Audit Findings Amounts invoiced by IBH adhered to contract payment provisions. Monthly program f ees were correctly calculated based on the number of licensees and enrollees of each Board, and each Board was billed their proportional share of the monthly program fee. IBH employed sound controls over licensee monitoring, including administering the app ropriate number of toxicology tests, establishing a monitoring agreement with the licensee, ensuring routine communication between the monitor and licensee, and establishing protocols for agreement and workplace monitors. Attachment #8Page 2 of 2 IBH could not demonstrate that it provided all required educational materials and outreach presentations to licensees, third -party evaluators, consultants, treatment providers, and licensee supervisors (workplace monitors), and stakeholders. IBH met most Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Program requirements, but opportunities for improvement remain. This includes ensuring it adheres to contract provisions regarding the frequency of licensee surveys \u2014which conflicted with informal agreements \u2014and Agreement Monitoring staffing lev els. Between July 2017 and June 2020, IBH did not meet staffing requirements 17 percent of the time. IBH met many, but not all, MSA reporting requirements. Monthly reports did not always include adequate information regarding licensees in compliance with m onitoring agreements and geographical information. IBH did not regularly submit quarterly reports on outreach activities; bi-annual reports on licensee or stakeholder input were not always submitted timely; and IBH did not submit required annual financial reports. In some cases, this resulted from conflicts between existing contract requirements and informal agreements between IBH and the Boards. Opportunities exist to better clarify contract language and expectations, including ensuring the frequency of li censee survey reporting (along with exit interviews and stakeholder surveys) and reporting requirements to reflect actual practice and meet the needs of the Boards. Key Recommendations Evaluate contract provisions, where IBH non -compliance was noted in this report, to ensure the provisions reflects the Boards' expectations and desired practice, and monitor compliance accordingly. Ensure IBH provides all required educational materials and outreach efforts , includ ing creation of a formal training manual fo r potential workplace monitors. Ensure IBH provides adequate FTE levels for each year's pricing tier; consideration should be given to the inclusion of FTE levels in the required benchmark reporting and penalty structure. Ensure accuracy in reporting perfo rmance statistics; while only one reporting inaccuracy was identified, consistent methodologies for calculating success rates against performance benchmarks is essential for program monitoring. Results IBH met most contractual requirements, generally met required minimal success rate standards, and submitted to the Boards invoices and reports that were accurate and supported by substantiating documentation. However, this audit also revealed instances of minor miscalculations in reporting one (1) performan ce metric and several instances in which IBH did not meet certain contract provisions related to outreach and training, quality assurance program requirements, and reporting requirements. The Boards have met to discuss the audit recommendations and finding s. They are in the process of issuing an amendment to the contract with language to better align with the expectations of the program. All parties have agreed to restructure quarterly meetings to ensure requirements are being met.

Using instructions in the didactic portion of this program, the dentist will prepare or purchase 5-10 teeth on a typodont that meet qualifications for placing an ITR. ITR tooth acceptability can be found in Module 3: IT R Placement Criteria . Make sure to prep a mixture of Class I lesions on various surfaces as well as Class V lesions. This will allow the EPDH to practice placing ITRs on a variety of teeth. With guided assistance from the collaborating Dentist, the EPDH should place a minimum of five ITRs on the typodont. It is suggested that the EPDH place additional ITRs if they are able, in order to become familiar and comfortable with manipulating the material prior to performing this procedure on patients. ITR Evalu ation Using the form in Appendix A, the Dentist should evaluate each ITR based on the following three criteria. Each criterion is rated as acceptable or unacceptable: 1. Margins are sealed 2. Occlusion is in light contact or not in contact 3. Minimal excess material An ITR is considered acceptable if the material is not in hyper--- occlusion, if there are no marginal voids, and there is minimal excess material. The dentist will review the ITRs according to the checklist and protocols outlined in the didactic portion of the program, and evaluate the ITR placement based on the provided criteria. The dentist should document the evaluation of each ITR on the Evaluati on Form in Appendix A . The EPDH will bring the typodont with completed restorations and scoring sheet completed by the collaborating dentist to the in -person session for review. EPDH Interim Therapeutic Restorations Training Manual 3 In-person Training Day Purpose The in -person clinical portion of the pro gram will allow both the EPDH and dentist to receive additional instruction and practice what they learned with experienced ITR placement faculty and mentors.

Total Committed: $111,797.01 for first 18 m onths Background and History of the Project: Selected Passages from the DPP #200 Application Need for the Project: Numerous reports within the last ten years have addressed workforce shortages in the dental field, lack of access to oral health care a mong low -income, rural, and other disadvantaged population groups, and the resulting profound oral health disparities experienced by these groups. Recent reports document that very slow progress is being made in improving the access to oral health care for these population groups. The health transformation process underway in Oregon has recently expanded access to the Oregon Health Plan for around 250,000 additional members. However, since the workforce situation has not been addressed, the existing dental workforce is under additional pressure and overall, access to dental care may further deteriorate. According to an Oregon Healthcare Workforce Institute analysis, the number of dentists practicing in Oregon decreased by 8% from 2010 to 2012 which may indicate a continuous trend. The traditional dental care delivery model of stationary dental offices or community health centers with dental practitioners and auxiliaries needs to be expanded to test alternative and sustainable models. Studies in other states have shown that a remotely located dentist, working with an Expanded Practice Dentist Hygienist (EPDH), who is seeing a patient at a different location, can collaboratively deliver quality dental care. Led by an EPDH, Capitol Dental Care will implement telehealth -connected oral health teams to reach children who have not been receiving dental care on a regular basis and to provide community -based dental diagnostic, prevention and early intervention services, including ITR placement when indicated by the den tist. Description of patients: Demographic Data about Availability of Health Care Services Polk County continues to show an increase in diversity, especially within the Hispanic population. 11.2% of the population considers themselves Hispanic compare d to 10% in 2007. The Caucasian population has grown from 86% to 87.9% while the American Indian/Alaskan Native population has remained consistent at 1.9%. There were slight increases in the African American population from .4% to .5% and in the Asian/Paci fic Islander population from 1.6% to 1.9% in 2009. According to the 2005 -2009 US Census Bureau data, 11.4% of Polk County residents speak a language other than English in their home compared to 14% of Oregon residents and 19.6% of US residents. Oral Healt h needs assessment suggested that 34.3% of the Polk County residents had no dental visit in the last 12 months. Currently, only about 20% of Oregon dentists accept Oregon Health Plan (OHP) members. In Marion and Polk Counties, there are 122 OHP enrolled dentists. This is approximately 1 dentist for every 550 members of the Willamette Valley Community Health (WVCH) Coordinated Care Organization. Although this may be considered an acceptable ratio issues remain of provider timely availability, appointment tim ing, and insurance coverage; thus, there are still barriers for OHP members' access. Oregon 2012 Smile Survey: This statewide survey gauges the health of the Oregon dental system by looking at the oral health, access, and overall quality of dental care f or school children, aged 6 to 9. The survey examines the percentage of children who need urgent dental care, have any tooth decay, have rampant tooth decay (7 or more cavities), and have received dental sealants. The survey showed those with lower incomes, non-English speaking, and Hispanic background generally have worse dental health outcomes than those who have higher incomes, speak only English, and are white. Purpose of the Project: To train Expanded Practice Dental Hygienists (EPDHs) and demonstr ate that EPDHs can successfully place \"Interim Therapeutic Restorations\" (ITRs) when directed to do so by a collaborating dentist. The ITR is an interim restoration designed to stop the progression of dental caries until the patient can receive treatment f or that tooth by a dentist. Oregon is in the midst of a dental health care crisis with more than 91 areas in the state designated as dental care health professional shortage areas (Kaiser Family Foundation study, April 28, 2014). This level of \"deficiency \" translates to more than 61% of Oregon residents not having their dental care needs met. One county where the need is particularly great is Polk County, and it is within this county - and the Polk County School District that a collaborative consisting of OHSU School of Dentistry, University of the Pacific Center for Special Care, and Capitol Dental Care (CDC) will implement its pilot project to train Expanded Dental Hygienists to place interim therapeutic restorations (ITR) within the context of a teleheal th connected dental team. This OHSU project has been planned and developed in collaboration with the University of the Pacific, Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry (UoP) and Capitol Dental Care (CDC). Project Description: Under the dental pilot proj ect program [Capitol Dental Care] CDC will build upon existing community outreach programs in Polk County by adding the telehealth model to existing preventive services, which include assessment, radiographs, intra -oral photographs, cleanings, sealants, fl uorides, oral health instruction, and ITR if indicated. CDC's telehealth connected dental team of Expanded Practice Dental Hygienists, dental assistants, and supervising dentist, will visit three schools within the District, serving approximately 10 childr en per day~75 per month with a total expected population of 1200 -1500 measurable encounters over the life of the 15 -month project. Those children with advanced disease in need of additional care will be referred for care either through CDC's mobile van op eratory, or directed to a dental clinic for restorative care, as needed. This Dental Workforce Pilot Project (DWPP) will add one new duty to those currently permitted for Expanded Practice Dental Hygienists (EPDHs) that are part of a community -based teleh ealth connected team system of care already under way. The Oregon Health and Science University will train Expanded Practice Dental Hygienists (EPDH) to perform a new duty in community settings to improve the oral health of underserved populations and dem onstrate their ability to carry out this duty. Project Objectives: Short -Term Objectives: Train EPDHs and evaluate their competence to place ITRs. Long -Term Objectives: Through the performance of these duties to allow EPDHs working in community setti ngs with underserved populations to facilitate collaboration with a dentist and to develop an appropriate plan of care for the patient. The placement of ITRs when directed to do so by a collaborating dentist will allow EPDHs to stabilize patients' oral hea lth from further deterioration until they can be seen by a dentist in an appropriate setting. To facilitate the development of new models of care designed to improve the oral health status of underserved populations. Laws and Regulations Pertinent to th e Proposed Project: The Dental Practice Act governs the scope of practice for both dentists and dental hygienists operating in the state of Oregon. The key provisions can be found at Oregon Revised Statutes, Chapter 680 (680.010 - 680.210 and 680.990 (Den tal Hygienists). Currently, an Expanded Practice Dental Hygienist (EPDH) may only perform the placement and finishing of direct alloy and direct composite restorations after the supervising dentist has prepared the tooth (teeth) for restorations (ORS 818-035-0072). 818-035-0010 D efinitions All terms used in this Division shall have the meanings assigned under ORS 679.010 except that: (1) \"Limited Access Patient\" means a patient who is unable to receive regular dental hygiene treatment in a dental office.

When circum- stances do not permit traditional cavity preparation and/or placement of traditional dental restorations or when caries control is necessary prior to placement of definitive restora- tions, interim therapeutic restorations (ITR)1 may be beneficial and are best utilized as part of comprehensive care in the dental home.2,3 This policy will differentiate ITR from atraumatic/alternative restorative techniques (ART )4 and describe the circumstances for its use. Methods This policy was developed by the Council on Clinical Affairs and adopted in 2001. This document is a revision of the previous version, revised in 2013. This updated policy is based upon electronic database and hand searches of medical and dental literature using the terms: dental caries, cavity, pri- mary teeth, deciduous teeth, atraumatic therapeutic restoration, AND glass ionomer; fields: all; limits: within the last 10 years, humans, English, birth through age 18. Additionally, websites for the AAPD and the American Dental Association were reviewed. Expert and/or consensus opinion by experienced researchers and clinicians was also considered. Background ART has been endorsed by the World Health Organization as a means of restoring and preventing caries in populations with little access to traditional dental care.4-6 In many countries, practitioners provide treatment in non-traditional settings that restrict restorative care to placement of provisional restora- tions. Because circumstances do not allow for follow-up care, ART mistakenly has been interpreted as a definitive restoration. ITR utilizes similar techniques but has different therapeutic goals. Interim therapeutic restoration more accurately describes the procedure used in contemporary dental practice in the United States. ITR may be used to restor e, arrest or prevent the pro- gression of carious lesions in young patients, uncooperative patients, or patients with special health care needs or when traditional cavity preparation and/or placement of traditional dental restorations are not feasible and need to be postponed.7,8 Additionally, ITR may be used for step-wise excavation in children with multiple open carious lesions prior to definitive restoration of the teeth, in erupting molars when isolation conditions are not optimal for a definitive restoration, or for caries control in patients with active lesions prior to treatment performed under general anesthesia.9,10 The use of ITR has been shown to reduce the levels of cariogenic oral bacteria (e.g., Mutans streptococci, lactobacilli) in the oral cavity im- mediately following its placement.11-13 However, this level may return to pretreatment counts over a period of six months after ITR placement if no other treatment is provided.12 The ITR procedur e involves removal of caries using hand or rotary instruments with caution not to expose the pulp. Leakage of the restoration can be minimized with maximum caries removal from the periphery of the lesion. Following preparation, the tooth is restored with an adhesive restorative material such as glass ionomer or resin-modified glass ionomer cement. 14 ITR has the greatest success when applied to single surface or small two surface restorations.15,16 Inadequate cavity preparation with subsequent lack of retention and insufficient bulk can lead to failure. 16,17 Follow-up care with topical fluor- ides and oral hygiene instruction may improve the treatment outcome in high caries-risk dental populations, especially when glass ionomers (which have fluoride releasing and re- charging properties) are used. 18-20 Policy statement The AAPD recognizes ITR as a beneficial provisional technique in contemporary pediatric restorative dentistry. ITR may be used to restore and prevent the progression of dental caries in young patients, uncooperative patients, patients with spe- cial health care needs, and situations in which traditional cavity preparation and/or placement of traditional dental restorations are not feasible. ITR may be used for caries control in children with multiple carious lesions prior to definitive restoration of the teeth. ABBREVIATIONS AAPD: American Academy Pediatric Dentistry.

A dentist shall not supervise more than 5 dental hygienists who place interim ther apeutic restorations under telehealth supervision. A dentist who supervises a dental hygienist that provides interim therapeutic restorations under telehealth supervision must have a physical practice location in Colorado for purposes of patient referral f or follow - up care. A. Pursuant to section 12 -220-104(10), C.R.S., an \"interim therapeutic restoration \" or \"ITR\" means a direct provisional restoration placed to stabilize a tooth on a pediatric or non -pediatric patient until a licensed dentist can assess t he need for further definitive treatment and involves the: 1. Removal of soft material using hand instrumentation, without the use of rotary instrumentation; and the 2. Subsequent placement of the following restorative materials: a. Glass ionomer. B. In order to be eligible for a permit to place an ITR, a dental hygienist must: 1. Hold a license in good standing to practice dental hygiene in Colorado; 2. Complete a course developed at the post -secondary education level offered under the direct supervision o f a member of the faculty of a Colorado dental or dental hygiene school accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) or its successor agency that complies with the following uniform training standards: a.

See \"Descri ption of Trainee Evaluation Process\" in sections B, C, and D below . B. Description of Course Content a. Curriculum Description The curriculum described here is intended to enable allied dental personnel in the performance of one new duty: Place \"Interim Therapeutic Restorations\" (ITR) when directed to do so by a collaborating dentist. It should be noted that the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry Policy on Interim Therapeutic Restorations (ITR) describes the technique as follows: \"The ITR procedure involves removal of caries using hand or slow speed rotary instruments with caution not to expose the pulp.\" In this DWPP project we will instruct trainees to perform this procedure using hand instruments without the use of slow speed rotary instruments. All these licensed professionals already have training and experience and are allowed to take radiographs and photographs, chart intraoral conditions, perform intraoral procedures, and place dental sealants. Instruction for these duties will involve lecture, labo ratory and clinical instruction at Capitol Dental care. The training will incorporate the rationale a nd techniques necessary for the new duty. This will be followed by the utilization and monitoring phase for the duration of the project. C. A description of the methodology utilized in the didactic and clinical phases.

Description of Trainee Evaluation The course structure and trainee eva luation are based on the fact that all these licensed professionals already have training and experience and are allowed to take radiographs and photographs, chart intraoral conditions, perform intraoral procedures, and place dental sealants. Therefore the new duties are relatively minor extensions of the current scope of practice of these EPDHs. ITR placement: During the ITR training, trainees will practice placing 10 ITRs (a mixture of Class I, II, III and V restorations) on typodonts. The three inst ructors will provid e feedback and coaching to the trainees during the practical training experience. Trainees will then complete another 10 ITRs independently. The instructors will evaluate all 10 of the trainee's ITRs using an ITR Evaluation Score Sheet . The score sheet evaluates whether the margins were sealed, if the restoration is too high, and if the material was confined to the cavity. Each of these characteristics will be assessed as either acceptable or unacceptable. A trainee is certified as completing the training when he or she has independently completed at least 5 satisfactory ITRs in a row. Following the didactic and laboratory training program, trainees will place ITRs on patients in the clinic. Trainees will place 5 ITRs with instructor coaching and feedback. Trainees will then complete up to another 10 ITRs independently. The instructors will evaluate all of the trainee's ITRs using an ITR Evaluation Score Sheet. The score sheet evaluates whether the margins were sealed, if the resto ration is too high, and if the material was confined to the cavity. Each of these characteristics will be assessed as either acceptable or unacceptable. A trainee is certified as completing the training when he or she has independently completed at least 5 satisfactory ITRs in a row.

ITR Tracking and Follow -Up Evaluation and Tracking Follow -up Adverse Outcomes Protocols After completing didactic module s 2-6, EPDHs should complete the accompanied quizzes with a score of 75% or higher. EPDH Interim Therapeutic Restorations Training Manual 2 Independent Lab Work Following the instructions on ITR Placement Techniques , the EPDH should practice placing ITRs on 5 - 10 prepared teeth prior to attending the in- person training. The purpose of the independent pre -in-person session lab work is to familiarize the EPDH with characteristics and techniques for using glass -ionomer restorative materials. Placement Practice Each dyad ( EPDH and dentist) will be responsible for obtaining equipment for and completing assigned lab work prior to attending the in- person program sectio n (see Appendix B: Equipment List). Using instructions in the didactic portion of this program, the dentist will prepare or purchase 5-10 teeth on a typodont that meet qualifications for placing an ITR. ITR tooth acceptability can be found in Module 3: IT R Placement Criteria . Make sure to prep a mixture of Class I lesions on various surfaces as well as Class V lesions. This will allow the EPDH to practice placing ITRs on a variety of teeth. With guided assistance from the collaborating Dentist, the EPDH should place a minimum of five ITRs on the typodont. It is suggested that the EPDH place additional ITRs if they are able, in order to become familiar and comfortable with manipulating the material prior to performing this procedure on patients. ITR Evalu ation Using the form in Appendix A, the Dentist should evaluate each ITR based on the following three criteria. Each criterion is rated as acceptable or unacceptable: 1. Margins are sealed 2. Occlusion is in light contact or not in contact 3. Minimal excess material An ITR is considered acceptable if the material is not in hyper--- occlusion, if there are no marginal voids, and there is minimal excess material. The dentist will review the ITRs according to the checklist and protocols outlined in the didactic portion of the program, and evaluate the ITR placement based on the provided criteria. The dentist should document the evaluation of each ITR on the Evaluati on Form in Appendix A . The EPDH will bring the typodont with completed restorations and scoring sheet completed by the collaborating dentist to the in -person session for review.

Joint Commission on National Dental Examinations, American Dental Association. All rights reserved. Executive Summary Technical Report: Dental Licensure Objective Structured Clinical Examination The Technical Report for the Dental Licensure Objective Structured Clinical Examination (DLOSCE ) is the main source of validity evidence available to state licensing boards and other users of DLOSCE results. Validity is the most important consideration for any examination program. For the DLOSCE , validity refers to the degree to which logic and evidence support the use and interpretation of examination results for making pass/fail decisions affecting candidates for licensure to practice dentistry. The technical report contains both direct evidence and references to other documents and sources of info rmation that contribute to this body of validity evidence. The background and historical information in this report allow users to understand the development of this program. The content of the Technical Report is presented to address professional standards regarding the validity of credentialing examinations (American Educational Research Association (AERA), American Psychological Association (APA), and the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME), 2014). Some of the principal information pres ented in the Technical Report is summarized below. Purpose: The purpose of the DLOSCE program is to measure whether a candidate possesses the clinical judgment and skills required for the safe, independent practice of entry - level general dentistry. Conte nt: Content specifications for the DLOSCE are based on subject matter expert judgment, and validity studies involving practice analyses. Test constructors are responsible for recommending minor modifications during the interim period between practice analy ses. The American Dental Association's (ADA) Joint Commission on National Dental Examinations (JCNDE), with input from its Commit tee on Examination Development , approves all changes to the content specifications. Item and Examination Development: Test construction teams are responsible for the development of items and forms/editions of the DLOSCE using JCNDE guidelines for writing high- quality items. Standard Setting and Scoring: The DLOSCE standard is criterion -referenced (not norm -referenced) . This means examination results are determined by specific criteria and not by the process sometimes known as \"grading on a curve.\" A panel of expert educators and practitioners recommend the minimum passing score, which was ultimately established by the JCNDE. The DLOSCE standard is maintained across examination forms through the use of equating procedures designed to control for small differences in the difficulty of items from one examination form to another. The equating process places exam ination results on a common metric regardless of which particular examination form was administered. Administration: The JCNDE maintains a high level of security on all examination materials. Strict precautions in place at the Joint Commission's offices and testing c enters help ensure test content remains secure. The Joint Commission offers the DLOSCE via computer at Prometric professional level testing center s throughout the United States, and its territories . Once eligible, candidates can schedule an examination for any business day, conditional on testing center availability . In addition to the items above, this report provides information on the history of the examination program , reliability of results , and examination security, among other matters.

Introduction Purpose of the DLOSCE Technical Report High-stakes examination programs must be concerned with validity. Validity refers to the degree to which logic and evidence support the use and interpretation of examination results in accordance with the purpose of the examination (AERA, APA, & NCME, 2014). The Joint Commission has an obligation to inform dental boards and communities of interest concerning its efforts to provide the highest quality examination programs possible. Established professional standards provide useful guidance to improve the quality of examinations. Testing programs must adhere to these standards and provide evidence their policies and procedures conform to them to help ensure confidence in the examination program. The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing, most recently published by AERA, APA, and NCME in 2014, provide professional standards for testing organizations. Chapter 7 of the Standards describes the importance of documented validity evidence in technical reports so examination users can evaluate the validity of examination results they interpret and use. This technical report provides a comprehensive summary of DLOSCE validation efforts , as well as background information which allows the reader to understand the program's development to its present state. The Joint Commission endeavors to provide the highest quality examination programs possible. The Joint Commission on National Dental Examinations The Joint Commission is the agency that oversees DLOSCE examination design, administration, scoring, and reporting. The ADA's Department of Testing Services (DTS) provides operational and technical support for the corresponding outlined activities. The mission of the Joint Commission is as follows: Protecting public health through valid, reliable and fair assessments of knowledge, skills, and abilities to inform licensure and certification decisions that help ensure safe and effective patient care by qualified oral healthcare team members. The Rules of the JCN DE provide descriptions of Joint Commission membership and the standing committees that serve the Joint Commission. Each of the Joint Commission's standing committees is charged with making specific recommendations to the Joint Commission concerning areas of focal interest . The Committee on Administration focuses on operational matters, including security, and budgetary considerations. The Committee on Dental Hygiene focuses on the National Board Dental Hygiene Examination (NBDHE), including examination content and specifications, test construction procedures, scoring and reporting of scores, dissemination of information related to the examination process, validity, and matters affecting finance. The Committee on Examination Development focuses on the dental examination programs , including examination content and specifications, test construction procedures, scoring procedures, and reporting. It also concerns itself with the dissemination of information about examination procedures and validity. The Committee on Research and Development focuses on research and development activities (e.g., psychometric investigations) related to both the dental and dental hygiene examination programs. The Committee on Communications and Stakeholder Engagement plans communicati on activities in support of JCNDE Programs, to help ensure that JCNDE communications are strategic, informative, timely, relevant, and considerate of the needs of external stakeholders. 6 2. DLOSCE Overview The first and most fundamental step in the development of any examination program is to establish a purpose. The purpose of the DLOSCE program is to measure whether a candidate possesses the clinical judgment and skills required for the safe, independent practice of entry -level general dentistry. The intended examinee population for the DLOSCE consists of candidates who are seeking a license to practice general dentistry in any state, district or other jurisdiction of the United States. The intended interpretation of DLOSCE results concerns the candidate's ability to apply clinical judgment and skills in the provision of patient care. A passing score on the DLOSCE indicates that a candidate is able to apply the aforementioned judgment and skills at the level required for the safe, independent practice of entry -level general dentistry. DLOSCE results are used by dental boards in determining qualifications of dentists who seek licensure to practice in any state, district or other jurisdiction of the Unit ed States, which recognizes the DLOSCE . 3. Historical Perspective In 2016, the ADA's Council on Dental Education and Licensure (CDEL) requested that the ADA's Department of Testing Services develop a business plan for development and implementation of a Dental Licensure OSCE. CDEL reviewed the plan at their December 2016 meeting and recommended the ADA's Board of Trustees provide funding to develop the DLOSCE. In January 2017 a National Licensure Task Force, jointly sponsored by the ADA and ADEA, unanimo usly endorsed the development of the DLOS CE. During its February 2017 meeting, t he ADA Board of Trustees discuss ed the DLOSCE business plan written by DTS. At that time, t he Board of Trustees authorized the formation of a DLOSCE Steering Committee charged with developing and validating the DLOSCE. Dr. Gary L. Roberts, ADA President, appointed a set of highly qualified individuals to the Steering Committee based on criteria established by the Board of Trustees. The DLOSCE Steering Committee held its inaugural meeting in July 2017 at the ADA headquarters in Chicago. Throughout the development and validation process\u2014and particularly during its first meetings \u2014 the Committee devoted considerable time and energy to discussions concerning the establishment of the DLOSCE content domain, and in what form and by which methods DLOSCE content should be presented to candidates. Subsequent to thorough review, in March 2018, the DLOSCE Steering Committee determined that the DLOSCE should be a virtual (i.e., computer -based) examination that would not directly measure psychomotor skills . The Committee also approved preliminary content areas and test specifications for the DLOSCE . Detailed information concerning the factors considered are provided in Section 6, \" Content Basis for the Examination ,\" and in a published article entitled \" The Dental Licensure OSCE: A Modern Licensure Examination for Dentistry \" (Ziebert and Waldschmidt, 2020). At this time, the Committee also authorized the formation of a DLOSCE Working Committee composed of dental subject matter experts, to recommend structures for DLOSCE test construction teams, and to guide the development of DLOSCE content during test construction meetings. The first DLOSCE test construction meeting took place in November 2018 , and a large number of additional test construction meetings were held in the six month period that followed. In 2019, the DLOSCE Steering Co mmittee approved modifications to the initial test specifications, and determined that the examination would contain questions involving lifelike, three -dimensional 7 (3D) models that c ould be interacted with and manipulated (magnified, moved, and rotated) by the candidate. Development of the 3D models began shortly thereafter. In January 2020, the ADA Board of Trustees approved the JCNDE as the governing body for the DLOSCE Program - an action consistent with the wishes of both the DLOSCE Steering Commit tee and the JCNDE, as expressed through formal communications between the two groups beginning in 2018 and continuing through 2019. In February 2020, the JCNDE voted to accept governance responsibilities pertaining to the DLOSCE , and the DLOSCE Steering Committee became an ad hoc Committee of the JCNDE at that time. In February 2020, the DLOSCE Steering Committee and several DTS staff travelled to a Prometric testing center to review a n initial completed version of the DLOSCE. Subsequent to their review , the Steering Committee members expressed overwhelmingly positive feedback regarding the quality of the examination. In April 2020, the JCNDE announced that the DLOSCE w ould be made available for use by dental boards in the United States , beginning in June 2020. Shortly thereafter, the JCNDE published a summary of validity evidence supporting the intended use and interpretation of DLOSCE results , and conducted a series of webinars for dental board members, dental educators, and dental students. Dent al boards from a number of US states subsequently indicated they would accept DLOSCE results as either fully or partially fulfilling their c linical examination requirement . The DLOSCE was updated to incorporate minor changes recommended by the Committee in February, and then administered for the first time from June 15 through July 17, 2020. Results from the first administration were released to candidates, dental boards, and dental schools in August 2020. 4. Professional Test Standards Large testing or ganizations responsible for developing, administering, and scoring examinations need criteria, or standards upon which to judge their effectiveness. Three professional organizations - AERA, APA, and NCME - joined forces and resources to create the latest version of The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (AERA, APA, NCME, 2014). These standards provide useful information to guide testing organizations in the validation of their test score interpretations and uses. Throughout this technical report, validity evidence is identified and connected to testing standards. Many sections of this technical report correspond to chapters in the Standards (AERA, APA, NCME, 2014). 5. Overview of Validity Validity is defined in the Standards as \"the degre e to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores for purposed uses of tests\" (AERA, APA, & NCME, 2014, p. 11). Validation involves the investigative process of creating a validity argument and collecting evidence relevant to this argument, the examination purpose, and the intended interpretation of results. When acquired validity evidence reveals weaknesses or deficiencies, the testing organization is expected to take steps to address the deficiencies to strengthen the validity of the test. The intended interpretation of DLOSCE results concerns the candidate's ability to apply clinical judgment and skills in the provision of patient care. A passing score on the DLOSCE indicates that a candidate is able to do so at the level required for the safe, independent practice of entry - level general dentistry. DLOSCE results are used by dental boards in determining qualifications of dentists who seek licensure to practice in any state, district or other jurisdiction of the United 8 States, which recognizes the DLOSCE . This technical report presents validity evidence and additional references that support the intended interpretation and use of DLOSCE results. This report is organized to address major categories of validity evidence. Each section contains narrative and validity documentation. In some instances, data are provided, as appropriate. The report addresses the following important categories of validity evidence, presented w ith corresponding section numbers: 6. Content Basis for the Examination 7. Test Design and Development 8. Scoring and Equating Methods 9. Standard Setting 10. Reliability 11. Test Administration 12. Results Reporting 13. Convergent Validity Evidence 14. Test Security 15. Rights and Responsibilities of Test Takers 16. Candidate Performance The information provided in this technical report covers the entire span of DLOSCE development through September 2020, including DLOSCE administrations that occurred in the summer of 2020. Legal Issues All examination programs where results are used for high- stakes decisions run the risk of legal challenge based on validity. As a result, examination programs must be designed to withstand legal challenges. This technical report represents an effective way to present the examination validity argument and corresponding validity evidence. This document organizes, describes, and presents a large amount of validity evidence. In so doing, boards can have confidence that the Joint Commission has acted responsibl y in its duty to develop and administer an examination program capable of fulfilling its intended purpose. 6. Content Basis for the Examination Content -oriented validity evidence is a critical source of validity evidence supporting the interpretation and use of DLOSCE results. The Standards indicate that developers of licensure examinations should provide a thorough description of the examination's content domain, along with evidence that the domain reflects the requirements of the profession for which candidates are seeking licensure (AERA, APA, NCME, 2014, p. 178- 179). This chapter details the DLOSCE content domain and describes the theoretical rationale and empiri cal evidence that support it. In short, the content domain for the DLOSCE consists of the clinical tasks that a dentist performs while providing direct, chair -side treatment to patients. The content domain is formalized in the DLOSCE test specifications, which were established using the methods and procedures described below. 9 Establishing the DLOSCE Test Specifications In 2018, the DLOSCE Steering Committee convened a review panel of subject matter experts to recommend test specifica tions for the DLOSCE. The recommended test specifications would describe the topic areas the DLOSCE should cover and the percentage of test items that should be allocated to each topic area. The review panel consisted of 11 dental subject matter experts, including general dentists, and specialists with expertise in the following areas: Prosthodontics, periodontics, oral radiology, oral diagnosis, oral surgery, endodontics, behavioral science, orthodontics, pharmacology, and dental a nesthesia. The panel included three members of the DLOSCE Steering Committee as well as an individual who had served on the Committee for an Integrated Examination (CIE) (the committee that developed and validated the Joint Commission's Integrated National Board Dental Examination (INBDE)) . The panel met for 1\u00bd days at the ADA building in Chicago. As a first step, the panelists studied the results of a dental practi ce analysis survey conducted by the JCNDE in 2016 . The purpose of the practice analysis survey was to gat her feedback from a nationally representative sample of practicing dentists, concerning the importance of various tasks that general dentists perform. The first section of the survey gathered information about the dentist and their practice environment. The second section consisted of a list of 56 clinical content areas (see Appendix A) . In this section, responding dentists were asked to rate each clinical content area with respect to its importance to patient care, and its frequency of use in patient care. The levels of the rating scale were defined as follows: Importance to Patient care: 5. Extremely important 4. Very important 3. Important 2. Somewhat important 1. Not important Frequency of Use in Patient Care: 6. More than 5 times per day 5. 3-5 times per day 4. 1-2 times per day 3. 1-4 times per week 2. Less than once per week 1. Never The JCNDE distributed the practice analysis survey to a total of 34,441 dentists. Among those, 2,542 (7.4%) provided valid responses. The mean importance rating and mean frequency rating were calculated for each clinical content area. The mean importance ratings across clinical content areas ranged from 3.22 to 4.82. The mean frequency ratings ranged from 1.7 to 5.92. The multiplicative model ( Kane, Kingsbury, Colton, & Estes, 1989) was used to provide an overall index of importance for each clinical content area. The members of the DLOSCE test specifications review panel studied the 56 clinical content areas from the practice analysis survey, along with the mean importance rating and mean frequency rating for each area. The panel members then engaged in a group discussion through which they 1) established a preliminary list of topic areas that the DLOSCE should cover (e.g., endodontics, periodontics) , and 2) made a preliminary determination regarding the percentage of test items that should be allocated to each topic area. Once the panel had established the 10 preliminary percentages as a group, each panelist separately reviewed the percent ages, and suggested changes as needed. The recommended changes were then summarized across the panelists, and presented to the group for consideration. A key step in establishing the recommended DLOSCE test specifications involved articulating areas of commonality and important differences between the DLOSCE and the JCNDE's Integrated National Board Dental Examination (INBDE). As part of this discussion, the review panel established a preliminary scope and boundaries for skills it felt the DLOSCE should assess (i.e., the DLOSCE skill domain). A statement concerning this scope is provided below. The DLOSCE covers the clinical tasks that a dentist performs while providing direct, chair -side treatment to patients in a clinical environment. This includes addressing issues that arise during the performance of a dental procedure. To further clarify the DLOSCE content domain, the panelists scrutinized the 56 clinical content areas included on the Joint Commission's practice analysis survey, which were broken down into three component sections: 1) Diagnosis and Treatment Planning, 2) Oral Health Management, and 3) Practice and Profession. Panel members then selected the clinical content areas they believed fit within the description of the DLOSCE skill domain they established in the previous step. Each panelist did this separately. Then, the panel worked as a group in an attempt to reach a consensus for each clinical content area. Next, the panelists completed an exercise that required them to link the preli minary topic areas to the clinical content areas from the JCNDE practice analysis. As part of this exercise, panelists were asked to identify the topic areas that were related to each of the 56 clinical content areas . Results of the linking exercise demons trated a strong relationship between the preliminary topic areas and the tasks that entry level general dentists perform, as indicated by the 56 clinical content areas from the practice analysis. This provided support for the appropriateness and comprehensiveness of the DLOSCE topic areas identified by the panel. Just prior to the close of the meeting, panelists were given an opportunity to recommend changes to the percentages allocated to the established DLOSCE topic areas. Five of the eleven panelists recommended no changes to the percentages. No panelist recommended a change larger than two percent for any topic area. After discussing their individual recommendations as a group, the panel decided to retain the original percentages . The resulting topic areas and corresponding percentages represented the review panel's recommendation concerning preliminary test specifications for the DLOSCE. The DLOSCE Steering Committee reviewed and approved the review panel's recommendation in March 2018. This established the preliminary test specification for the DLOSCE. In 2019 the DLOSCE Steering Committee rev isited the preliminary DLOSCE test specifications and made modifications based on feedback from the DLOSCE Working Committee, DLOSCE test constructors and DTS staff. I n 2020, the JCNDE reviewed and approved the test specifications , which appear in Appendix B. Each DLOSCE form is built to meet the specifications , ensuring that candidates who attempt the DLOSCE encounter an examination that is comprehensive and parallel in its coverage of the content domain . The JCNDE conducts comprehensive practice analyses on a periodic basis, and will continue to use practice analysis results, in combination with subject matter expert judgments, to ensure that the DLOSCE test specifications reflect clinical dental practice. In the time period between practice analyses, DLOSCE t est constructors evaluate the specifications and - accompani ed by appropriate justification - recommend minor changes as needed, for consideration by the JCNDE. 11 DLOSCE Content and the Question of Psychomotor Skill Evaluation The preceding discussion focuses largely on the procedures used to determine the DLOSCE test specifications. An important question that has been present throughou t DLOSCE development involves whether to include or not include a psychomotor skill evaluation component within DLOSCE administrations. The DLOSCE Steering Committee specifically and carefully considered this important question. In so doing, the following factors were thoroughly discussed: research evidence as it pertains to current clinical licensure examinations, which include both patient -based and manikin components research from the National Dental Examining Board (NDEB) of Canada, which had for decades utilized an O bjective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) instead of a patient -based clinical examination the fidelity of existing manikin and dental simulation technology, as it relates to the day - to-day experience of practicing dentists ethical considerations pertaining to the use of patients in clinical examinations for licensure purposes the pre- eminent role of clinical judgment as it relates to the application of psychomotor skills the standards for dental education as promulgated by the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA), and the corresponding dental subject matter expert site visitors who scrutinize the quality of educational training provided at US dental schools the educational training provided by dental schools in accordance with CODA standards the evaluative tools and methods used by dental schools to understand whether a given student has demonstrated the necessary level of clinical judgment and skills the focal reasons for board disciplinary actions the applied experience of dental educators the need for comprehensive assessment of a candidate's clinical knowledge, skills, and abilities, a t the time of licensure the validity and reliability of available and proposed solutions, from a rigorous psychometric perspective and in accordance with professional standards and guidelines The DLOSCE Steering Committee fully acknowledged the critical importance of psychomotor skills in dental practice. Dentists rely heavily on psychomotor skills in treating their patients. Having noted this, the Committee was dismayed to see the dearth of research evidence supporting the validity of current clinical licensure examinations, whose focus primarily rested upon the measurement of these psychomotor skills (see, for example, Chambers, 2011; Formico la 1981; Ranney et al., 2004) . The Committee noted in particular a published editorial appearing in the Journal of Dental Education, offered by Dr. Steven Friedrichsen, Dean and Professor of the College of Dental Medicine of the Western University of Health Sciences. Consistent with the Committee's findings, Dr. Friedrichsen (2016) indicated the following: \"There is no peer -reviewed scientific evidence that correlates [clinical licensure examination] outcomes with other validated assessments of clinical competence ... the process yields no verifiable value in its ultimate objective of providing for the protection of the public.\" (p. 640) The Committee was acutely aware of the essential ity of validity , particularly in high- stakes 12 licensure testing in health care, where the public health is at risk. The following opening statements from the first chapter of the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (2014) were germane : \"Validity refers to the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores for proposed uses of tests. Validity is, therefore, the most fundamental consideration in developing tests and evaluating tests . ... Evidence of the validity of a given interpretation of test scores for a specified use is a necessary condition for the justifiable use of the test.\" (p. 11). In considering these matters, the Committee's review yielded the following core findings: peer-reviewed research evidence fails to provide adequate support for the use of patient -based and manikin- based clinical licensure examinations (Chambers, 2011; 1981; Ranney et al., 2004) ; these examinations unfortunately do not appear to protect the public. peer-reviewed research evidence has supported use of the NDEB Canada OSCE (see Gerrow et al. , 2003 ; Gerrow et al., 2006) ; additionally, Canada has relied on their OSCE and written examination for decades, without apparent issue. existing dental simulation technology was interesting but did not yet possess the level o f fidelity necessary to warrant application in licensure testing; this technology should continue to be monitored and considered in the future. current manikins also lacked reasonable fidelity from the Committee's perspective. Manikin utilization was regarded as perhaps useful in the early stages of dental education, but represented a step backward when used for licensure purposes. As one member of the DLOS CE Steering Committee noted \"drilling on plastic teeth just shows that an individual can drill on plastic teeth.\" in the past, there were varying points of view regarding the perceived rigor of the CODA accreditation process, and questions were present concerning the scope and rigor of school- based assessment procedures. However \u2014thanks to over 25 years of hard work and the adoption and evolution of competency -based education in accredited dental schools, as well as the identification of new, effective pathways for dental clinical assessment \u2014the situation has changed and strong accreditation standards are now in place and uniformly enforced throughout the US (American Dental Association, American Dental Education Association, American Student Dental Association, 2018) . consistent with CODA standards, dental students are currently evaluated on their psychomotor skills and performance on hundreds of occasions during their enrollment in dental programs accredited by CODA (American Dental Association, American Dental Education Association, American Student Dental Association, 2018) . This evaluation can take place using a variety of proven methods of skill evaluation and assessment, including patient -based, manikin- based, simulations, and OSCEs . current and former dental board members serving on the DLOSCE Steering Committee indicated that board disciplinary actions appear to predominantly focus upon issues involving mistakes arising from poor clinical judgment , substance abuse, and ethical failures, as opposed to deficiencies in psychomotor skills numerous dental educators have indicated to Committee members and staff that current clinical examinations appeared to be failing candidates arbitrarily: o the strongest students sometimes failed clinical licensure examinations while less skilled stu dents passed without issue 13 o virtually all students who failed a clinical licensure examination passed on their next attempt, in many cases without any remediation with respect to ethical issues, the Committee noted that the American Dental Association, Amer ican Dental Education Association, and American Student Dental Association had all adopted policies seeking to end the use of patients in dental clinical licensure examinations. These three associations in turn formed a joint Task Force on Assessment of Re adiness for Practice, and issued a report (Sept 2018) indicating the following: \"... the Task Force opposes single, encounter, procedure- based examinations on patients, which virtually all states currently use to fulfill the clinical examination requirement. This approach has been demonstrated to be subject to random error; does not have strong validity evidence; is not reflective of the broad set of skills and knowledge expected of a dentist; and poses ethical challenges for test - takers, dental schools, and the dental profession ... this single focus is typically in lieu of the patient's comprehensive and most severe or urgent needs, resulting in a standard of care that may well be below today's acceptable level ... the Task Force calls upon state dental boards to eliminate the single encounter, procedure- based patient exams, replacing these with clinical assessments that have stronger validity and reliability evidence.\" (p2) This task force set the stage for the Coalition for Modernizing Dental Licensure, which has moved forward to help achieve the desired changes. current clinical examinations are not adequately comprehensive, focusing only on a narrow set of procedures conducted on an extremely small number of patients (e.g., often just two or three) with an ex tremely limited sample of performance obtained. In light of these findings, the Steering Committee determined that the new examination should be computer -based and not directly measure psychomotor skills (i.e., due to the unfortunate deficiencies associat ed with current methods of psychomotor skill evaluation in dentistry ). Given the positive research findings associated with OSCEs, the Committee felt that a hybrid or \"virtual OSCE\" should be pursued, with lifelike 3D models to emulate the experience in the dental clinic. Utilization of 3D models in lieu of live patients could provide further benefits through increased standardization of the testing experience, improving the reliability and validity of the examination with respect to its intended purpose. Extended multiple choice questions to accompany these 3D models could reduce the impact of guessing and provide candidates with a simulated clinical situation possessing greater fidelity and requiring sound clinical judgment, to truly understand whether a candidate \"thinks like a doctor.\" In short, the Committee determined that the public would be far better served by a comprehensive examination focused upon clinical judgment. The quality of clinical judgments made by practicing dentists have a causal effec t on patient outcomes, and psychomotor behaviors themselves. The Steering Committee concluded that utilization of manikins and patient -based demonstrations of performance should be unnecessary given the questionable evidence that is present even after decades of use of these examinations by boards. 7. Test Design and Development Having established the content basis for the DLOSCE, the next considerations involved test design and development. The overall design of an examination is a crucial step in test development. The DLOSCE is designed with the full participation of content expert teams and supervised by staff specialists working in the Department of Testing Services test development 14 area. This process ensures that the expertise of highly qualified, licensed dentists is brought to bear during the examination design process. Joint Commission staff in the Department of Testing Services provide technical support and guidance to help ensure the desired technical qualities are achieved during the examination design phase. Examination Format The DLOSCE is a comprehensive examination consisting of 150 items. This includes 148 multiple choice items, and two prescription tasks. Pre-examination materials (e.g., the DLOSCE Candidate Guide) provide candidates with information concerning the format and scoring rules for each item type. Multiple choice items. Multiple choice items appearing on the DLOSCE represent clinical problems that the candidate must solve. Each multiple -choice item consists of a stem, wh ich poses a clinical problem, followed by a list of possible answers. The stem of an item is usually either a question or an incomplete statement. The two types of multiple choice items that appear on the DLOSCE are described below. Single correct answer (i.e. single select) . These multiple choice items consist of a stem, which poses a clinical problem, followed by a list of possible options. A candidate can only select one option , and only one of the possible options is correct. If the candidate selects the correct option , they earn full credit for the question; otherwise they earn no credit. One or more correct answers (i.e., multi- select) . These multiple choice items consist of a stem, which poses a clinical problem, followed by a list of possible options. One or more of the possible options is correct. To earn full credit , a candidate must select all of the correct options and avoid selecting any of the incorrect options . A candidate who selects an incorrect option automatically earns no credit for the item. A candidate can earn partial credit if they select one or more of the correct options and avoid selecting any of the incorrect options . When multiple correct options are present within an item, DLOSCE test constructors assign a point value to each correct option . Some options may also be designated as unscored. Candidates neither gain credit nor lose credit for selecting an unscored option. An option can be design ated as unscored, for example, if it cannot be judged definitively based on the informa tion presented in the item, or if subject matter experts disagree on whether or not it is correct. DLOSCE test constructors determine which options, if any, will be unscored. Prescription Tasks. As noted previously, the DLOSCE contains two prescription tasks. These tasks require a candidate to review a Patient Box and determine an appropriate prescription for the patient described therein. For each prescription task, a candidate must 1. review a Patient Box, which provides information about the patient for whom the prescription will be written; 2. select appropriate medication(s) from a list; 3. specify the strength of the tablet/capsule (e.g., 500 mg); 4. specify the total number of tablets/capsules that should be dispensed; 5. identify the number of tablets/capsules that should be taken per administration; 6. specify whether or not the patient should take a loading dose; and 15 7. identify the frequency of administration (e.g., once a day until finishe d, twice a day as needed) Prescription task responses are evaluated against a scoring key established by subject matter experts. Based on the combination of responses selected by the candidate, it is possible for the candidate to receive no credit, parti al credit, or full credit for each prescription task . Three -dimensional models. The DLOSCE contains items involving three- dimensional (3D) models that can be interacted with and manipulated (magnified, moved, and rotated) . The JCNDE has made an online tu torial available, so that candidates can practice interacting with a sample 3D model before they attempt the examination. A tutorial provided at the beginning of the examination instructs examinees on how to manipulate the model . Items involving 3D models include a help feature tha t displays similar instructions for the candidate to reference during the examination . Patient Box. Many DLOSCE items include a Patient Box. The Patient Box presents information available to the dentist at the time of the visit. The elements of the Patient Box are described below. There are a number of benefits associated with using the Patient Box format to present patient information. Specifically, the Patient Box : permits the candidate to focus on the concept tested, as opposed to question wording (thereby reducing construct -irrelevant variance), simplifies the item writing process for test constructors , allowing them to focus on concept s for evaluation, and presents concepts to be tested within the c ontext of an actual patient, thereby 16 increasing the correspondence between test content and the actual experiences of practicing entry -level dentists. In short, the Patient Box is intended to maximize construct -relevant variance and minimize construct- irrelevant variance. Candidates are instructed to always consider the Patient Box in their responses, and a tutorial provided at the beginning of the examination instructs examinees on how to appropriately interpret information provided in the Patient Box. Si milarly, pre-examination materials (e.g., the DLOSCE Candidate Guide) also includes information concerning the Patient Box. DLOSCE Test Constructors The Joint Commission relies on subject matter expert test constructors to develop and review DLOSCE items and examination forms . The role of test constructors is fundamental to the examination's validity argument . Test constructors are responsible for developing a clear, precise, and co mpre hensive set of items for each examination form; in accordance wi th established test specifications and utilizing rigorous procedures. Together these efforts providing content -related validity evidence in support of test usage . The Standards indicate that examination developers should describe the qualifications and cha racteristics of test constructors, and provide information about the training and materials test constructors receive (AERA, APA, NCME, 2014, p. 88). The section below presents this information, as it pertains to the DLOSCE . Test constructors meet in t eams to engage in test development activities. Test constructors use their subject -matter expertise\u2014including their experience and understanding of dental practice and familiarity with the curriculum in accredited dental schools \u2014to create, review , and finalize examination content. The following is a list of the responsibilities of every test constructor. Submit test development materials (e.g., images, items) , in compliance with JCNDE guidelines, within the designated time frame . The number of materials that test constructors are expected to submit varies according to the needs of the examination program. Attend each test construction meeting for the duration of the session. Construct examination forms according to JCNDE guidelines, test specifications, and content outlines , within the designated time frame. Construct additional items for JCNDE item banks as necessary. Assign ownership of all examination materials to the ADA and JCNDE, by agreeing to the terms of the copyright assignment. Inform the Joint Commission of changes in dental practice, dental procedures, and dental education curricula, suggest ing modifications to the test specifications as appropriate. Consider special issues and make recommendations at the request of the JCNDE. Safeguard the security and confidentiality of the examination by declining offers to assist with review courses and examination preparation materials while serving as a test constructor , and for at least one year following the final term of their appointment. Comply wit h the ADA's policy on professional conduct. This policy includes prohibitions against sexual harassment and other forms of unlawful conduct. The DLOSCE test specifications provide core information to new test constructors. New test constructors receive an orientation which provides information about the DLOSCE program, and the item development and review process. 17 Test Construction Teams . DLOSCE test constructors work in teams, referred to as Test Construction Teams (TCTs), to develop DLOSCE items . In 2018, the DLOSCE Steering Committee authorized the formation of a DLOSCE Working Committee, composed of dental subject matter experts, to recommend structures for DLOSCE TCTs, and to guide the development of DLOSCE content during test construction meetings. The Working Committee proposed structures for DLOSCE TCTs, based on the DLOSCE test specifications and the needs of the examination program, and the structures were accepted by the DLOSCE Steering Committee and implemented shortly thereafter. Most DLOSCE TCTs meet multiple times per year, with most meetings approximately 2\u00bd days in duration. TCT meeting s are typically facilitated by one or more members of the DLOSCE Working Committee , in collaboration with DTS staff facilitators . The main categories of DLOSCE TCTs are described in detail below. Additional teams may also be created on an ad hoc basis to meet the targeted needs of the examination program. Item Writing and Review Teams . Item Writing and Review team s typically consist of three to ten test constructors. Depending upon item development needs, multiple teams may be formed. Each team is responsible for developing items and reviewing newly written items to ensure content accuracy, currency, and validity, as well as adherence to the test specifications and item guidelines outlined by the Joint Commission. Item Writing and Review teams are typically organized according to the major areas of the DLOSCE test specifications (e.g., Oral Surgery, Periodontics) . In order to serve on an Item Writing and Review team, a test constructor must be currently licensed as a dentist in the United States , and a graduat e of an accredited advanced education program in th e specialty area for which they develop items. Clinical Relevance Review Teams. Each Clinical Relevance Review team consists of five to ten General Dentists . This team confirm the appropriateness of examination items in terms of their relevance to day -to-day clinical practice . The teams are also responsible for the final categorizati on of items , relative to the DLOSCE test specifications and in support of the general needs of the DLOSCE program. In order to serve on a Clinical Relevance Review Team, a test constructor must be a full-time or part -time practitioner or clinician/scientis t with at least five years of experience, who is in practice at least 20 hours per week (inclusive of clinical teaching) , and who is currently licensed as a dentist in the United States. Form Review Teams. Form Review teams provide a final review of DLOSC E items and images identified for placement on examination forms, with respect to clinical relevance and the activities of a practicing general dentist. They ensure that the content being tested is comprehensive , meets the test specifications, and that there is no unintended overlap among the items included on each form. Test Constructor Selection. On an annual basis t he Joint Commission advertises and promotes its need for test constructors. A letter explaining the online application materials and select ion criteria is emailed to dental schools, dental boards, constituent dental societies, and other institutions and individuals each year. All applications are processed by staff and presented to the Joint Commission's Committee on Examination Development , which is responsible for recommending individuals to serve in the DLOSCE Test Constructor Pool. On an annual basis t he Joint Commission's Committee on Examination Development approves and reapproves test constructors to serve in the DLOSCE Test Construct or Pool. An individual who has completed five years of service in the pool may be considered for re- approval as dictated by the needs of the examination program. DTS staff place approved test constructors 18 onto specific TCTs based on the expertise of the individual , the recommendations of the Committee on Examination Development at the time of the individual's selection, and the needs of the TCT and examination program. A team is formed for each specific meeting, and disbands at the end of that meeting. These teams are flexible and may or may not consist of the same test constructors each year. Teams may be rearranged as needed in the event that a given volunteer is not able to attend. If a volunteer is invited but is unable to attend, an alternate volunteer is identified and invited. Additionally, if a volunteer is invited to attend a meeting and does not respond in a timely manner, an alternative volunteer is identified and invited to attend the meeting. This process helps ensure teams have a sufficient numb er of volunteers with the required expertise, so that meeting goals can be accomplished efficiently and effectively. Item Validation The Standards indicate that examination developers should document the process used to develop, review, and evaluate items (AERA, APA, NCME, 2014, p. 87- 88). This section describes the item validation process that the JCNDE has implemented for the DLOSCE. Content accuracy review. During content accuracy review, test constructors review items for accuracy and currency. In some cases, this review is conducted by the members of the original Item Writing and Review team who developed the item. In other cases, the review is conducted by test constructors who are external to the original Item Writing and Review team. Item classification. Item classification review is performed to specify the areas of content expertise identified for the item. This review is similar to how a librarian classifies material into subject areas using a defined taxonomy. The classification review includes the review or specification of all metadata for the item. Editorial review. During editorial review, items are reviewed for grammar, style, formatting, and alignment with DTS item writing guidelines. Similarly, item stimulus materials are reviewed to ensure the information is of diagnostic quality and in accordance with modern dental practice. Legal/intellectual property (IP) review. Joint Commission staff seek counsel from the ADA Division of Legal Affairs concerning the articulation of guiding principles that might inform procedures and help avoid legal issues involving examination content. This includes, for example, issues arising around privacy and the use of intellectual property. Individuals who submit images and materials to the Joint Commission are responsible for verifying intellectual property rights. Clinical relevance review. The DLOSCE is designed for licensure purposes, to help state boards understand whether a candidate possesses the necessary clinical judgment to enter the profes sion and safely practice dentistry. The general dentist is thus of focal importa nce to the DLOSCE Program. During the clinical relevance review, corresponding review teams scrutinize items to help confirm item content is clinically relevant and applicable to the work of practicing dentists. This review helps reduce the likelihood of an examination form containing trivial and/or esoteric content. 19 Item performance review. Items that survive the reviews described above are eligible to be placed on examination forms . Once an item has been placed on a form, and once the form has been administered to a sufficient number of candidates, DTS calculates the following statistics for each item: 1) The mean score for the item; and 2) The item -total correlation, defined as the Pearson correlation between performance on the item and performance on the examination. The mean score for the item is an indicator of an item's difficulty, and the item -total correlation is an indicator of an item's ability to discriminate among candidates of different ability levels. Items that fail to discriminate among candidates of different ability levels are scrutinized by staff and then routed to appropriate test constructors for review. Items that do not perform appropriately are removed from scoring. Subsequent to administration, test constructors review examination content and relevant psychometric information and determine whether items can and should be revised . The revision process could, for example, involve rewording the stem or changing the distractors . If an item is revised, it is returned to the item bank where it becomes a candidate for placement on a future examination form. If test constructors determine that an item cannot be improved through revision, the item is des ignated as unusable. 8. Scoring and Equating Methods Scoring Approach There are two common approaches to scoring licensure examinations. Under the first approach, the pass/fail decision is based on a single score that is determined from the candidate's performance on the entire examination. Under the second approach, an examination is divided into separately scored sections, and the candidate must pass each section in order to pass the examination. The latter approach is often used when the topic areas on an examination are substantially distinct from one another and candidate competence on each topic area must be verified separately. When examination topic areas are highly correlated, on the other hand, the former approach is often used, because a single score based on all the test items will be more reliable than the scores determined for the individual topic areas. Analysis of data from administration of the DLOSCE strongly suggests that a candidate's DLOSCE result (i.e., pass or fail) should be based on a single score derived from the candidate's performance on the entire examination. Exploratory factor analysis of candidate scores on the nine DLOSCE topic areas suggests they are indicators of a common underlying ability that can be well represented with a single score; the ratio of the first to second eigenvalue from the factor analysis was 9.8, and a parallel analysis (Horn, 1965), scree test (Cattell, 1966), and the application of Kaiser's (1960) criterion all converged on the finding that a single underlying factor was present. Based on this, the JCNDE has adopted a scoring approach for the DLOSCE whereby a candidate's result is determined based on their overall performance on the examination. The section below describes how the overall score and corresponding pass/fail result is determined for each DLOSCE candidate. 20 Scoring Methods DLOSCE results are determined through a multi -step process. In the first step, non- performing items are identified and removed so that they do not count toward candidate scores . Non- performing DLOSCE items are identified based on two statistics: the mean score for the item, which is an indicator of an item's difficulty, and the item-total correlation, which is an indicator of the item's ability to discriminate among candidates of different ability levels. In the second step, a raw score is determined for each candidate. The raw score represents the total number of points the candidate earned on the examination, after removing the non- performing items. Each raw score is also expressed as a percent correct score, which is calculated as the raw score divided by the total number of points possible. As mentioned previously, the DLOSCE contains three types of items: 1) single-select items 2) multi -select items , and 3) prescription tasks. Candidates can earn a maximum of 1 point for each single - select and multi -select item , and a maximum of 4 points for each prescription task. Partial credit is po ssible for multi -select items and prescription tasks. When multiple forms of the DLOSCE are administered, percent correct scores are adjusted through a psychometric process known as equating, to statistically adjust for any differences in the difficulty of the examination forms (for details, see the section titled Equating Methods). The equating process helps ensure that all DLOSCE candidates are held to the same performance standard, regardless of which examination form they attempt . In the third step, each candidate's equated percent correct score is converted to a scale score. DLOSCE scale scores can range from 49 to 99 and are expressed as whole numbers (e.g., 49, 50, 51). A scale score of 75 represents the minimum level of clinical judgment and skills required for the safe, independent practice of entry -level general dentistry, as determined through standard setting activities (see Chapter 9). A candidate must earn a scale score of 75 or higher to pass the DLOSCE. Candidates who receive a scale score of 75 or higher receive a status of \"Pass,\" while candidates who receive a scale score below 75 receive a status of \"Fail.\" Equating Methods . Multiple forms of the DLOSCE are available for administration. The JCNDE takes care to ensure that all DLOSCE forms meet the DLOSCE test specifications and are as parallel as possible. However, because the forms contain different items, small form -to-form differences in difficulty are typically present. The JCNDE uses a process called equating to statistically adjust for these differences. The equating process helps ensure that all DLOSCE candidates are held to the same performance standard, regardless of w hich examination form they attempt. The Standards indicate that test developers should provide evidence supporting the claim that results from different forms of an examination may be used interchangeably (AERA, APA, NCME, 2014, p. 105). The discussion provided herein is intended to help provide that supporting evidence. The JCNDE uses a common- item nonequivalent groups design to equate DLOSCE scores . In the common -item nonequivalent groups design , there are two samples of candidates, each of which is administered a different form of the examination. There are also some items that are common to both examination forms. The common items comprise an anchor test which ultimately forms the basis for the score adjustments. Due to their importance, the anchor test items are carefully chosen based on the guidelines described in Kolen and Brennan (1995). According to these guidelines, the anchor test should meet the test specifications proportionally, and have a sufficient number of items (e.g., 20 percent of the len gth of a full examination form, or at least 30 items). 21 The Tucker linear method (Angoff, 1971) is used t o place scores from different DLOSCE forms on the same measurement scale. The Tucker linear equating method is intended for use when a common -item nonequivalent groups equating design is employed. Under the Tucker method, scores from Form X are placed on the Form Y scale using the following equation: = () ()[ ()]+(), 8.1 where is the Form X score expressed on the Form Y scale, and (), (),(), and () are the means and standard deviations of the scores on Forms X and Y for the combined population of candidates (i.e., the candidates who take Form X combined with the candidates who take Form Y) . Because the candidates who take Form X do not have scores on Form Y , and vice versa , the means and standard deviations in Equation 8.1 are estimated using information about candidate performance on the anchor test items (for the algebraic formulas used to estimate the parameters in Equation 8.1 , see Angoff, 1971 or Kolen, 1985). Quality Assurance. The Standards indicate that those responsible for scoring examinations should establish and document quality assurance measures (AERA, APA, NCME, 2014, p. 118). Accordingly, the JCNDE has established strict quality control measures to facilitate accurate scoring of the DLOSCE . At the close of each DLOSCE administration window, a roster of candidates scheduled to complete the DLOSCE is compared with the candidates appearing in result files, to ensur e no result files are missing. Examinations are independently scored by two separate DTS analysts, and the resulting scores are compared against one another to ensure they are identical before results are released to candidates. DTS staff maintain documentation related to the examination scoring process , and corresponding quality assurance procedures . 9. Standard Setting A critical step in the development of any licensure examination involves the establishment of the cut score that separates passing and failing candidates (AERA, APA, NCME, 2014, p. 100- 101). The Standards indicate that subject matter experts involved in setting cut scores should be qualified, and that the process for setting the cut score should be well described and documented (AERA, APA, NCME, 2014, p. 107- 108). The information provided below is presented in fulfilment of this requirement . Standard Setting Procedures In August 2020, the JCNDE convened a standard setting panel to recommend a performance standard (i.e., cut score) for the DLOSCE. The panel identified its recommend ed cut score using a modified version of the Bookmark standard setting method (Lewis, Mitzel, Mercado, & Schulz, 2012) . The modified method was inspired by Angoff's (1971) \"Yes/No\" method of cut score establishment (see Impara & Plake, 2006), and ha d been successfully implemented previously as reported by Buckendahl et al. (2 006). The standard setting activities involved the following steps: 1. A standard setting panel was convened. The panel was composed of seven members who were diverse with respect to practice experience, gender, areas of specialized knowledge, and geographic region. 22 2. The panel members received a thorough overview of the purpose and content of the DLOSCE . This included a descrip tion of the test specifications, test construction methods, and scoring methods . As a re ference, p anel members were also provided with information concerning recent failure rates for several existing dental licensure examinations . 3. Prior to the meeting, panel members completed an abbreviated version of the DLOSCE that was approximately representative of a full version of the DLOSCE with respect to content, difficulty level, timing, and item formats. During the meeting, panel members self-scored their abbreviated examinations and subsequently discussed the items as a group. 4. The panel members engaged in a c omplete and thorough discussion of the characteristics and skills of the \"just qualified\" (i.e., minimally competent) candidate, focusing on candidate skills in the specific topic areas covered on the DLOSCE. 5. Following the discussion phase, panel members were trained in the Bookmark standard setting method and given an opportunity to practice the method using provided practice materials. 6. Next, p anel members reviewed a large set of examination items that had been placed into an Ordered Item Booklet (OIB) assembled as follows: Each page of the OIB contained one item. The items included in the OIB spanned a representative range of difficulty levels. Items within the OIB were presented in ascending order of difficulty such that the item on the first page was the least difficult and the item on the last page was the most difficult. Single- select items appeared once within the OIB. The \"success criteri a\" for these items involved the candidate answering the question correctly, thereby earning the candidate full credit for the item . Each partial credit item represented in the OIB appeared twice within the booklet : 1) When an item involving partial credit appeared in the OIB for the first time, the difficulty value for that item was based on the proportion of candidates who earned at least partial credit for the item . 2) When an item involving partial credit appeared for the second time, the difficulty v alue for that item was based on the proportion who earned full credit for the item . Given the preceding\u2014 and for purposes of the OIB \u2014partial credit items therefore involved two separate \"success criteria \" levels (i.e., partial credit and full credit) . 7. After reviewing the OIB, each panel member was asked to independently \"bookmark\" the page number in the OIB of the last item for which a minimally competent candidate would have at least a 50 percent probability of meeting the aforementioned OIB item success criteria . The cut score associated with the bookmarked OIB page was then defined as the score earned by a hypothetical candidate who succeeded on all of the items up to and incl uding the marked page, and failed on all of the items thereafter. The median OIB page placement (across panelists) and corresponding cut score was used to represent the group's recommendation. 23 8. After making their judgments, panel members engaged in group discussion regarding their bookmark placements and the rationales for their judgments. During this phase panel members were provided with information about the bookmark placements of the other panel members, and the anticipated impact of using the cut score associated with the median bookmark placement (i.e., the percent of candidates who would fail under that cut score ). 9. Steps 7 and 8 as described above were repeated three times. After each replication , panel members were provided an opportunity to ask questions, request clarification, express any concerns, and engage in group discussion. Subsequently, each panel member was asked to provide a final recommended OIB page placement. The final recommended cut score for the examination was based on the median of the panelists' page placement s. 10. At the con clusion of t he activities , panel members were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their impressions of the process. Most panel members strongly agreed with the following statement : \"Overall, I support the final group- recommended cut score as fairly representing the appropriate performance standard for the DLOSCE. \" On a five -point rating scale, ranging from 1=Strongly Disagree to 5=Strongly Agree, the mean rating for this question was 4.14. The recommended performance standard resulting from the 2020 DLOSCE standard setting activities was accepted and implemented by the Joint Commission in August 2020. As a matter of practice, t he JCNDE revisit s performance standards periodically , conduct ing new standard setting activities as needed (e.g., if substantial changes are made to the DLOSCE test specifications , and as dental practice evolves in substantive ways ). 10. Reliability Score reliability is an important indicator of examination quality. Test developers strive to ensure test scores provide a stable and precise measurement of a candidate's knowledge, skills, and abilities. Despite efforts to eliminate possible sources of me asurement error, random factors can affect candidate performance and subsequent examination results. Reliability indices assess the degree to which random error affects scores. When scores on an examination demonstrate l ow reliability , they are strongly in fluenced by random sources of measurement error. Conversely, when scores on an examination demonstrate high reliability , they are less subject to random sources of error. The Standards highlight the importance of reporting the reliability of test -based decisions for high stakes licensing examinations (AERA, APA, NCME, 2014, p. 46- 47). A strategy that is commonly used to increase reliability is to lengthen examinations. Having uniformly high- quality items also contributes to reliability. Internal Consistency Reliability The Joint Commission uses the alpha reliability coefficient (Cronbach, 1951 ) as one index of score reliability for the DLOSCE . Coefficient alpha is an index of internal consistency reliability , and can range from zero to one, with higher values indicating higher reliability. Once an estimate of score reliability has been obtained, the standard error of measurement for the examination scores can be estimated as follows: =1 10.1 24 where s is the standard deviation of the scores, and rxx is the reliability estimate. Under the assumption that random errors are normally distributed, t est users can construct a 95 percent confidence interval around a candidate's score by adding and subtracting 1.96 standard errors of measurement from the score . Table 10.1 presents alpha reliability coefficients and standard errors of measurement for recent administrations of the DLOSCE. Table 10.1 Alpha Reliability and Standard Error of Measurement Year Candidates Alpha Reliability Standard Error of Measurement 2020 245 .75 - .83 3.10 - 3.41 Note. The values presented represent the range of estimates calculated across examination forms and/or test administration windows. Estimates are based on data from candidates who were attempting the DLOSCE for the first time. Classification Accuracy and Classification Consistency When scores on an examination are used as a basis for making pass/fail decisions, it is important for the test developer to demonstrate that the pass/fail decisions are reliable (AERA, APA, NCME, 2014, p. 46 -47). To evaluate reliability, t esting programs t ypically estimate classification accuracy and classification consistency. Classification accuracy is the probability that a candidate's pass/fail result on an examination reflects the decision that would be made had their true skill level been known. Class ification consistency is the probability that a candidate would receive the same pass/fail result on two hypothetical, successive administrations of an examination. The JCNDE estimates classification accuracy and consistency for the DLOSCE using a Classical Test Theory -based version of the method described in Rudner (2001), whereby a common standard error of measurement is used for each candidate (see Equation 10.1). Table 10. 2 presents estimates of classification accuracy and classification consi stency for recent administrations of the DLOSCE. Table 10.2 Classification Accuracy and Classification Consistency Year Candidates Classification Accuracy Classification Consistency 2020 245 .941 - .948 .916 - .921 Note. The values presented represent the range of estimates calculated across examination forms and/or test administration windows. Estimates are based on data from candidates who were attempting the DLOSCE for the first time. 11. Test Administration The DLOSCE is administered during fix ed administration windows throughout the year . Prometric administers the examination at its Professional Level Testing Centers located throughout the United States and its territories. Once eligible, candidates can schedule an examination for any business day within the administration window , conditional on testing center availability. The administration schedule for the DLOSCE is provided in Table 11.1. 25 Table 11.1 DLOSCE Administration Schedule Section Minutes Tutorial (optional) 25 Section 1 (37 items) 75 Scheduled break (optional) 10 Section 2 (37 items) 75 Section 3 (2 prescription tasks) 10 Scheduled break (optional) 10 Section 4 (37 items) 75 Scheduled break (optional) 10 Section 5 (37 items) 75 Post-examination survey 20 Total Time 6 hr. 45 min. The DLOSCE Candidate Guide de tails DLOSCE candidate eligibility requirements and the DLOSCE application process. The guide is made available to candidates through the JCNDE website (ada.org/JCNDE). 12. Results Reporting Reporting DLOSCE Results to Candidates DLOSCE results are reported to candidates through a secure, password protected electronic portal. Results are typically made available to the candidate within four weeks of the close of the corresponding DLOSCE administration window , barring unusual circumstances (e.g., a candidate's results are being voided or withheld). DLOSCE candidates who pass the examination receive a report indicating their result is \"Pass ,\" but do not receive numeric scores. Candidates who fail the DLOSCE receive a report indicating their result is \"Fail\" along with their numeric overall DLOSCE scale score. DLOSCE scale scores can range from 49 to 99 in one- point increments; candidates must earn a scale s core of 75 or higher to pass the examination. For remediation purposes, candidates who fail the DLOSCE are also provided with a graphical depiction of their performance in the following areas: Restorative Dentistry Prosthodontics Oral Pathology, Pain Management, and Temporomandibular Dysfunction Periodontics Oral Surgery Endodontics Orthodontics Medical Emergencies The numeric scores represented in the graphic are placed on a common scale so candidates can compare their relative performance in the different areas and identify areas where they are most in need of remediation. Consistent with best practices outlined in the Standards, the 26 results report issued to candidates who fail the DLOSCE contains explanatory text that is intended to help candidates interpret their results accurately . Reporting DLOSCE Results to Dental Boards When candidate s apply to take the DLOSCE, they also indicate which dental boards should receive their official results. The JCNDE reports Pass/Fail results to the requested dental boards through a secure, password protected electronic portal . A history of the candidate's Pass/Fail results is made available to each dental board requested to receive results. Numeric scores are not reported to dental boards. Reporting DLOSCE Results to Dental Schools A candidate's Pass/Fail results are reported to the candidate's dental school , provided that the school is accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). Results are reported to the school's dean or designee through a secure, passw ord protected electronic portal. CODA accredited dental schools receive periodic reports that describe how their stude nts on average perform on the examination, as compared to the national student average. 13. Convergent Validity Evidence Convergent validity evidence is established when scores on an examination are positively correlated with scores from other measures of similar constructs. The following section provides convergent validity evidence in support of the DLOSCE . Correlation with National Board Dental Examination Scores The JCNDE used data from 2020 administrations of the DLOSCE to examine the relationships between scores on the DLOSCE , and scores on Parts I and II of the National Board Dental Examination (NBDE). The observed Pearson correlations are provided in Table 13.1. Performance on the DLOSCE showed a moderately strong correlat ion with performance on NBDE Part II, which measures knowledge and cognitive skills in the clinical sc iences. Performance on the DLOSCE showed a moderate correlation with performance on NBDE Part I, which measures knowledge and cognitive skills in the biomedical sciences. Table 13.1 Observed Pearson Correlations among DLOSCE and NBDE Scores: 2020 N=245 1.00 NBDE I .36 1.00 NBDE Part II .54 .60 1.00 Note. Estimates are based on data from candidates who were attempting the examination for the first time. Table 13. 2 shows the fully disattenuated Pearson correlations between scores on the DLOSCE, and scores on NBDE Parts I and II . The fully disattenuated correlations correct for unreliability in 27 the measured variables and represent estimates of what the correlation s would be if the variables were measured with perfect reliability. Table 13.2 Fully D isattenuated Pearson Correlations among DLOSCE and NBDE Scores: DLOSCE 1.00 NBDE I .41 Part II .62 .66 1.00 Note. Disattenuated correlations were estimated using the DLOSCE=.83; NBDE Part I=.93; NBDE Part II=.90. Estimates are based on data from candidates who were attempting the examination for the first time. The correlations presented in Tables 13.1 and 13.2 provide s trong convergent validity evidence in support of the intended interpretation and use of DLOSCE results. As expected, DLOSCE scores correlate d more strongly with NBDE Part II scores th an with NBDE Part I scores (DLOSCE and NBDE Part II both focus on the clinical sciences, while NBDE Part I focuses on the biomedical sciences). In reviewing the disattenuated correlations, it should be noted that perfect correlations between the DLOSCE and NBDE scores would not be desirable, since perfect correlations would indicate that the DLOSCE and NBDE s measure an identical construct . The DLOSCE is intended to measure a construct that is related, but not identical to those measured by NBDE Parts I and II. Correlation with Clinical Performance in Dental School The JCNDE conducted a study to understand the relationship between candidates' scores on the DLOSCE and their clinical performance in dental school. To do so, the JCNDE collected dental school performance information for 40 DLOSCE candidates who attempted the examination in the summer of 2020. All 40 candidates in the sample were students in the graduating class of 2020 in the same CODA -accredited dental education program in the United States . The study focused on two indicators of candidate performance in dental school : 1) performance in clinical courses in the third-year of dental school , and 2) final clinical performance, as rated by the program's senior associate dean for academic affairs. Results of the correlational analyses are described in the section that follows. Clinical p erformance in third-year dental c ourses. Candidate clinical performance in third- year dental courses was evaluated using course performance data provided by the dental education program that participated in the study . 1 For each third-year course, students had an opportunity to earn a letter of commendation (LOC) by demonstrating superior performance. For the present study, third- year performance was defined as the total number of LOCs earned during the year (referred to hereafter as the LOC Sum Score) . The third-year curriculum included 14 courses , so LOC Sum Score s could range from zero to 14. The thi rd-year courses covered the following areas: Oral Pathology, Oral Surgery, Pediatric Dentistry, Prosthodontics, Endodontics, Orthodontics, Medical Emergencies, Management of Medically Compromised Patients, Health Promotion, and Dental Practice Operations. 1Performance information for fourth-year courses was not available. 28 Table 13.3 presents the observed and disattenuated correlations between DLOSCE scale scores, and the LOC Sum Scores for third -year dental courses . As shown in the table, t he observed Pearson correlation between the two outcomes was .3 7 (p < .05) , which represents a moderate positive relationship. Visual inspection of the scatter plot of the two variables , however, revealed that a single outlier exerted a strong influence on the correlation. For this reason, Table 13.3 also presents the Pearson corr elation calculate d with the aforementioned outlier removed. After removing the outlier , the observed Pearson correlation was .57 (p < .05). The partially disattenuated correlations presented in Table 13.3 correct for unreliability in the LOC Sum Scores, and represent estimate s of what the correlations between the two variables would be if the LOC Sum Scores were perfectly reliable. The fully disattenuated correlations correct for unreliability in both the LOC Sum Scores and the DLOSCE scores , and repres ent estimates of what the correlations would be if the LOC sum scores and the DLOSCE scores were both perfectly reliable. Table 1 3.3 Correlation between DLOSCE Scale S cores and Clinical Performance in Third- Year Dental Courses: 2020 Observed Pearson Correlation Partially Disattenuated Pearson Correlation Fully Disattenuated Pearson Correlation Full Study Sample (N=40) .37* .46* Sample with .76* Note. The partially disattenuated correlations w ere estimated assuming a reliability coefficient of .66 for the letter of commendation (LOC) sum scores. The fully disattenuated correlations were estimated assuming reliability coefficients of .66 for the LOC sum scores and .83 for the DLOSCE scores. *p < .05 Final clinical performance in dental school. The concurrent validity study also examined the relationship between candidates' performance on the DLOSCE, and their clinical performance in dental school, as rated by the program's senior associate dean f or academic affairs. For this portion of the study, t he senior associate dean was asked to categorize the 40 students in the analytic sample into one of three groups based on their final clinical performance in dental school, relative to their 4th year peers.2 The question posed to the dean appeared as follows: Please place each student into one of the following categories, with regard to their final clinical performance in dental school, relative to their 4 th year peers. Top 20% Middle 60% Bottom 20% The 40 DLOSCE candidates from the participating school were classified by the dean into one of the three performance groups. Table 13. 4 presents a summary of the DLOSCE scale scores for the candidates in each group . Prior to calculating the means, the DLOSCE scale scores for 2The student performance ratings were collected after the pass/fail DLOSCE results had been released to the dental education program that participated in the study. However, the senior associate dean did not have access to candidates' numeric DLOSCE scores at any time. 29 the 40 candidates in the sample were standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.3 Table 13. 4 Descriptive Statistics for Standardized DLOSCE Scale Score s, by Group (N=40) Academic Dean's Rating of the Candidate's Final Clinical Performance in Dental School Candidates Mean of Standardized DLOSCE Scale Score s Standard Deviation of Standardized DLOSCE Scale Scores Top 20% of Class 8 0.59 0.90 Middle 60% of Class 24 0.03 0.95 Bottom 20% of Class 8 -0.69 0.92 Each candidate was classified into a performance category by their senior associate dean for academic affairs. On average, candidates rated as being in the top 20% of their class in terms of their final clinical performance scored . 59 standard deviations above the mean on the DLOSCE , while candidates rated as being in the bottom 20% of their class scored .6 9 standard deviations below the mean on the DLOSCE . This amounts to a difference of 1.28 standard deviations between the lowest and hi ghest performing groups. Stated slightly differently, the preceding indicates that candidates demonstrating the strongest clinical performance in dental school achieved DLOSCE scores that were on average 1.28 standard deviation units higher than those demonstrating the weakest clinical performance in dental school. This is a sizable performance difference on the DLOSCE, and is interpreted as representing a very large effect size by commonly applied interpretive guidelines within the field of psycholog ical measurement . The polyserial correlation between the clinical performance ratings and the DLOSCE scale score s was .47 (p < .05) , which is also understood as representing a strong effect size.4 Overall, t he results presented in Tables 13.3 through 13.4 indicate that performance on the DLOSCE is positively correlated with clinical performance in dental school . Again, these findings provide strong convergent validity evidence in support of the intended interpretation and use of DLOSCE results. Notably, t he correlations observed here are substantially stronger than those observed in similar convergent validity studies involving clinical licensure examinations that 3A data sharing agreement was established with the dental school that participated in the validity study. The agreement stipulated that the study results reported in this technical report would not contain specific information about the school's performance on the examination. The DLOSCE scale scores were standardized as a means of abiding by the terms of the agreement. The standardized scores can only be interpreted normatively, and therefore provide no information about the participating school's examination performance relative to the DLOSCE performance standard. 4As noted in discussions involving Table 13.3, an outlier was present in the analytic sample that exerted a strong influence on the correlation between LOC Sum Scores and DLOSCE scale scores. While this particular candidate was an outlier in the LOC analysis, this candidate did not have a large impact on results of the analysis involving faculty ratings of candidate performance. For completeness, the analysis involving faculty ratings was also performed after removing this individual from the data set. After removing the individual, the mean difference between DLOSCE scale scores for the Top 20% and Bottom 20% clinical performance groups increased from 1.28 to 1.34 standard deviations, and the polyserial correlation between clinical performance ratings and DLOSCE scale scores increased from .47 to .49. 30 include patient -based and manikin components (Chambers, 2011; Formicola 1981; Ranney et al., 2004). 14. Test Security General Principles Effective examination security procedures are critical to the success of any examination program. Responsibilities for examination security are clearly defined for test developers, test administrators, and examination users. Examination security is maintained through test development and test administration procedures in a variety of ways. DTS policies address issues related to examination security and are reviewed periodically by the Joint Commission and its staff. Security Audit In 2008, Caveon Test Security, an independent organization, conducted a security audit of DTS . This audit was conducted to identify potential security risks, propose specific measures to ameliorate or diminish any potential risks, and provide recommendations to support security planning. The findings of the audit supported the overall security measures implemented within DTS. Identifica tion of Secure Materials The Standards highlight the importance of maintaining appropriate data security, including protections for candidate score information and sensitive ancillary information (AERA, APA, NCME, 2014, p. 121) . Accordingly, the Joint Commission has identified certain materials as secure. These include the following: 1. individual items and item materials (e.g. radiographs, clinical photographs); 2. scoring materials (e.g., item analyses, answer keys, and statistical analyses); 3. computer scoring software; 4. standard setting materials and meeting notes; 5. item banks; and 6. candidate personal information. Departmental Procedures The Joint Commission and DTS have a number of procedures in place that are designed to increase examination security. Relevant procedures are described in the section below. Policies and legal issues. All items and examinations are copyrighted to establish ownership and restrict their use or dissemination through unauthorized means. Policies and procedures for handling secure materials require continuous secure custody of materials and a chain of evidence attesting to the status and location of secure materials. Personnel. The team that maintains the security of examination materials includes Joint Commission staff, vendors, and volunteers. Personnel who handle examination materials must be screened at the time of hire or selecti on for assignment to disqualify individuals who could represent an unacceptable risk. All staff members are trained in procedures for handling secure materials and are required to comply with policies on confidenti ality and conflict of interest. The 31 examin ation development staff maintain security on examination materials during the developmen t process. All vendors are responsible for maintaining security of examination materials. Joint Commission staff review vendors' operations to ensure compliance with security policy. Service agreements with vendors must reasonably adhere to the Joint Commission's security procedures. Volunteers who assist in the development of items and editions of the examination must complete agreements regarding confidentiality, copyright assignment, and conflicts of interest. Volunteers are prohibited from releasing information about examination content. Facilities. Access to the offices of the Joint Commission is restricted and secure. Security of Test Materials in Electronic Format. Departmental and vendor computers are protected with firewalls, login identifications, passwords and other current forms of security. Access to electronic files is limited to authorized individuals. Testing Procedures. Examinations are administered by Prometric at its nationwide, professional level testing centers. The DLOSCE Candidate Guide describe procedures for identification of candidates, including requirements for positive identification through biometrics. Candi date conduct is closely monitored during the testing appointment. Examination regulations and testing center policies are designed to deter cheating and prevent security breaches. Policies and Procedures for Dealing with Breaches in Security The Joint Commission provides specific procedures for observing and reporting security breaches and communicates them to test administrators. The Joint Commission promptly investigates reports of security breaches and responds appropriately given the nature and sever ity of the breach. When the source of a security breach is identified, the Joint Commission takes legal action or imposes appropriate sanctions. 15. Rights and Responsibilities of Test Takers Documentation Provided to Candidates The Standards indicate that information about an examination should be provided to all test takers, free of charge and in accessible formats (AERA, APA, NCME, 2014, p. 133- 134). Accordingly, the Joint Commission annually publishes the DLOSCE Candidate Guid e. This document provides detailed information related to Joint Commission policy , rules and conduct, the format and content of the examination, eligibility requirements, examination regulations, the appeal process, examination scoring, and examples of item formats. The JCNDE also makes publicly available a set of DLOSCE practice questions that is provided free of charge. Each year the DLOSCE Candidate Guide is updated and amended as necessary. The guide and DLOSCE practice questions are available through the Joint Commission's website at ada.org/JCNDE. This technical report also serves as a source of documentation that is freely available to all DLOSCE candidates through the JCNDE website. Fair Treatment and Recourse 32 According to the Standards, candidates are entitled to fair treatment. This includes the right to information regarding available means of recourse pertaining to irregularities and appeals (AERA, APA, NCME, 2014, p. 137). For the DLOSCE, candidates whose results are subject to being voided ar e notified by written correspondence and provided with a copy of the Limited Right of Appeal for Examination Candidates. Candidates are notified of the appeal decision approximately 60 days after receipt of the appeal. When considering an appeal, the JCNDE strives to ensure that examination results accurately reflect candidates' skills, and that the appealing candidate has an opportunity to gain DLOSCE certification equal to, but not greater than, the opportunity provided to other candidates. The JCNDE strives to handle irregularities and their investigation in a professional, fair, objective, and confidential manner. 16.

Chicago Ave. Chicago, IL 60611 www.ada.org The Council of State Governments (CSG) is partnering with the Department of Defense (DoD), American Dental Association (ADA) and American Dental Hygienists Association (ADHA) to support the mobility of licensed dentists and dental hygienists through the development of new interstate compacts. These compacts will create reciprocity among participant states to reduce the barriers to license portability and employment. CSG, DoD, ADA, and ADHA invite dentists and dental hygienists, dentistry and dental hygiene regulators, and other industry stakeholders to a kickoff meeting to launch the initiative on Tuesday, August 24, 2021 at 2 p.m. EDT via Zoom. Participants will learn about the background and aspirations for the project; the form and function of interstate compacts and the compact development process; and the need for license reciprocity in the dentistry and dental hygiene professions.

Link to register here.Dentistry and Dental Hygiene Compact Kickoff Meeting: Tuesday, August 24, 2021Newsletters & Articles of Interest Volume 2, No. 15, June 22, 2021 ED Extends Title IX Protections to LGBTQ Students The Department of Education (ED) issued a Notice of Interpretation extending Title IX protections to LGBTQ students. Title IX is the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination at federally funded institutions. This new interpretation will be effective on the date the notice is officially published in the Federal Register , which will be within the coming weeks. The Biden administration's interpreta tion of Title IX brings it in alignment with the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, which determined that under Title VII \"sex\" should be interpreted to include LGBTQ people, when they face discrimination based on their sexual orient ation or gender identity. Though the Bostock ruling was narrow because it only applied to workplace discrimination, many legal scholars believe this ruling can plausibly be applied to other situations. The Biden administration's interpretation of the l aw reverses the prior Trump administration's interpretation. Prior to President Trump leaving office, the ED released a policy memo which stated that LGBTQ students are not expressly included in protec tions under Title IX. ED maintained that under Title IX, \"sex\" should only be interpreted to mean \"biological sex, male and female.\" There have been at least 31 states that have introduced or passed bills that would ban transgender students from playin g sports that correspond with their gender identity. These laws could be contested under Title IX. ED Holds Public Hearings on Title IX The Department of Education (ED) held five days of public hearings on Title IX. In advance of the hearings, ED received over 15,000 written comments and over 700 individuals and organizations registered to testify. Bo th supporters and opponents of the current Title IX regulations participated in the hearings or submitted comments to ED. The hearings were a fact -finding effort to receive testimony from all stakeholders impacted by Title IX and get their input on any cha nges to Title IX regulations that are needed. The hearings' topics ranged from sexual assault and harassment prevention to transgender athletes, from fairness issues surrounding the Title IX hearing process to Title IX jurisdictional issues. In May, ED announced virtual public hearings to gather input on improving enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The hearings, which are being held in accordance with ED's planned review of current Title IX regulations, stem from President Biden's Executive Order on Guaranteeing an Educational Environment Free from Discrimination on the Basis of Sex, Including Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity signed on March 8. The order explicitly directed the Department to evaluate Title IX regulation changes implemented during the Trump administration to determine if they are inconsistent with the Biden admini stration's policies. The hearings are also in line with the Biden administration's overarching policy towards gender, gender identity and sexual orientation as set out in Biden's Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation . The order's policy directive was \"to prevent and combat discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation, and to fully enforce Title VII and other laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.\" ED will consider information gathered from the hearings as it drafts its proposed changes to Title IX regulations. The proposed draft will likely be released before the fall. Maryland Adds Comprehensive Dental Benefits for Pregnant and Postpartum People Enrolled in Medicaid On May 30, a bill became law in Maryland that will add comprehensive dental benefits for pregnant and postpartum people enrolled in Me dicaid. Specifically, the bill requires the Maryland Medical Assistance Program to provide coverage for medical and other health care services, including comprehensive dental benefits, to all eligible pregnant people whose family income is at or below 250% of the poverty level. This coverage must be provided for the duration of the pregnancy and for one year immediately following the end of the pregnancy, as permitted by the federal law. The state curre ntly provides Medicaid coverage to pregnant women for 60 days postpartum. Texas Governor Signs Teledentistry Bill On June 16, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) signed a bill that would add a definition of teledentistry to the state's telehealth laws. The following are among the changes made by the bill: Teledentistry would include both synchronous and asynchronous communication as described in the bill. The state's Medicaid program would be required to reimburse dentists at the same rate as in - person dental service. Private insurers would be required to provide coverage for a covered service or procedure delivered by a preferred or contracted health professi onal on the same basis and to the same extent that the plan provides coverage for the service or procedure delivered in an in -person setting. The Texas State Board of Dental Examiners (TSBDE) would be permitted to adopt rules to address specified teledent istry topics that include allowing dentists to simultaneously delegate to and supervise through a teledentistry dental service up to five health professionals who are not dentists. TSBDE would also be required to adopt rules that prohibit a dentist from pr escribing an opiate for more than a two -day period or a controlled substance other than an opiate for more than a five-day period. (These periods may be extended by a day if the period for which the prescription is prescribed includes a weekend or a nation al holiday.) Earlier this year, TSBDE determined that teledentistry could not be practiced under current law . The bill has been sent to the State Senate for consideration. Michigan Governor Signs Bills to Increase Licensure Portability for Members of the Military and Their Dependents On June 10, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) signed a pair of bills that would increase licensure portability for members of the military, veterans and their dependents. SB 312 and SB 157 are tie -barred bills that address sim ilar topics, and both bills were required to become law in order for either to become effective. Together, the bills will require the state to issue an occupational license to any member of the military, a veteran or their dependent, if that person has held an active license granted by another jurisdiction for at least one year. Any person seeking licensure under the provisions of the bills must not have had a license revoked or suspended, unresolved discipline imposed or a complaint, any allegation or any investigation pending. Dependents are defined as a spouse, a surviving spouse, a child under 26 years of age or a surviving child under 26 years of age.

Finding \"Normal\" Aer the Pandemic \"Normal\" is the buzz word of the day. Our country is eager for a \"return to normal,\" but that is not so easy aer all that we have experienced. The pandemic represents a chronic, long-term and on-going tragedy. When any tragedy strikes, normal human reacons follow a paern called \"crisis response.\" This happens naturally in all of us and encompasses a range of both physical and emoonal responses. Inially, our insncts take over and we experience \"Fight, Flight or Freeze\" reacons to threats or danger. In these moments, physical reacons include increased adrenaline, heightened senses, increased heart rate, hypervenlaon, sweang, etc. We experience a variety of emoonal reacons as well. These may include shock, disbelief, denial, anger, fear, sorrow, confusion, frustraon, and guilt. connued on next pageSupporng Your Teenagers Caron Treatment Program recently provided some helpful tools and informaon about supporng teenagers that IBH is passing along.

For health care providers on the front line, this is even more true. To put it mildly, this has been exhausng, both physically and emoonally. It is helpful to discuss what happened in retrospect in a supporve and safe environment. Validaon of your experiences and acknowledgement of your emoonal and physical reacons is helpful. Aer any crisis, most people show signs of stress. These symptoms are typically a normal reacon to an abnormal situaon.

It can feel like there is an expectaon to return quickly to pre-pandemic acvies and responsibilies. This may be a welcome change, but there may also be dicules and challenges during this process. Aer more than 15 months of being encouraged to stay home and avoid contact with those outside of your family or \"pod,\" you may feel uneasy about resuming acvies like eang in a restaurant, aending a movie or performance, going to an outdoor fesval or parade, traveling, or many other acvies that have not been a part of \"normal\" life since early 2020. You may welcome the opportunity to forego wearing a mask in some spaces as guidelines and policies change, but it may also make you feel uneasy or unsafe. You may be ready to jump back into pre-pandemic life with both feet, but you may also feel anxious about doing so (or likely, somewhere in the middle). Being familiar with these signs of stress in yourself and your loved ones can be helpful. These signs are normal and should decrease over me. That said, it is important to know how to relieve stress in a healthy way and know when to get help. The rst step is to priorize self-care. Keep Yourself Healthy Eat healthy foods and drink water. Avoid excessive amounts of caeine. Do not use alcohol or tobacco. Do not use other drugs that have not been prescribed by your physician. Increase self-help meeng aendance, contact with your sponsor or other supports as needed. Get enough sleep and rest. Get physical exercise. Use Praccal Ways to Relax Relax your body oen by doing things that work for you\u2014take deep breaths, stretch, meditate, wash your face and hands, or engage in pleasurable hobbies. Pace yourself between stressful acvies. Do a fun thing aer a hard task. Use me o to relax\u2014eat a good meal, read, listen to music, take a bath, or talk to family. Talk about your feelings to loved ones and friends oen. Pay Aenon to Your Body, Feelings, and Spirit Recognize and heed early warning signs of stress. Recognize how your own past experiences aect your way of handling this event and think of how you handled past events. Know that feeling stressed, depressed, guilty, or angry is common aer a traumac event. Connect with other who experienced the pandemic in a similar way as you did. Take me to renew your spirit through meditaon, prayer, or helping others in need. It may take me to feel like you've regained control over your life. Be paent with yourself. Somemes things become so overwhelming that you need help from a professional. Also remember that those around you have experienced the stressors of the pandemic in their own unique way. connued on next pagehpspmonitoring.com | 888-802-2843Health Professionals' Services Program You may be able to support them: Oer your assistance and show a willingness to listen even if you haven't been asked for help.

Survey researchers consider this response rate sufficient to generalize the results to the population surveyed. Salary figures are reported as the median response (the median is the point in a data set at which about 50% of the responses fall above and 50% fall below). Salary figures are reported as hourly wages, without including the dollar value of any employee benefits. DANB has conducted a salary survey every two years since 2004.

The new rule will be issued this week and the requirement to be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing will apply starting September 30th. This will give employers time to prepare for implementation, and will give currently unvaccinated health care workers time to become fully vaccinated. \"The more contagious Delta variant has changed everything. This new safety measure is necessary to stop Delta from causing severe illness among our first line of defense: our doctors, nurses, medical students, and frontline health care workers. Protecting our frontline health care workers through vaccination will also enhance the safety of the patients in their care,\" said Governor Brown. \"Severe illness from COVID -19 is now largely preventable, and vaccination is clearly our best defense. Vaccination and weekly testing ensure Oregonians can safely access health care and employees can go to work in an environment that maximizes health and safety measures for COVID -19.\" Scott Palmer of the Oregon Nurses Assoc iation (ONA) said: \"This is a reasonable and sensible approach which respects the individual choices of health care workers while also protecting public health. ONA believes COVID- 19 vaccinations are critical to protecting our members, our patients, our families and our communities and we urge all Oregonians who can get vaccinated to do so now. \"ONA is also gratified to note that Oregon's current law provides the state the flexibility necessary to respond to public health emergencies via regulation. ONA is eager to continue our work with hospitals and community groups to encourage vaccinations through a wide range of options including free vaccine clinics, vaccine education, vaccination incentives and community outreach to improve vaccination rates and addr ess the rampant disinformation that is creating uncertainty and fueling vaccine hesitancy. Vaccination is a critical tool to keep Oregonians healthy and safe and Governor Brown's announcement today will help close the gap in vaccination rates for Oregon's valuable health care workers.\" The new rule applies to personnel in health care settings who have direct or indirect contact with patients or infectious materials. The Governor's Office continues to look at additional health and safety options to protect Oregonians against the highly contagious Delta variant, including vaccination and testing policies for state workers, with conversations continuing with stakeholders about how similar protective measures can be implemented in various state workplaces. Governor Brown called on other public and private employers in Oregon to consider measures to facilitate their employees' access to vaccines: \"As we have throughout this pandemic, we are learning to adapt to the new reality the Delta variant has created. I am encouraging Oregon cities, counties, businesses, and employers to think creatively, and to consider measures such as paid time off for vaccination, and incentives for employees, in addition to instituting masking requirements and other health and safety measures in the workplace. I am doing the same with the State of Oregon's workforce, as we look for ways to remove barriers to easy access to vaccination.\" State law currently prohibits employers from independently mandating vaccines for certain limited categories of workers, including health care workers, an issue the Governor intends to work with stakeholders and legislators to address in the February 2022 session.
