Although there is no concrete definition of \"clean label\", in recent years the trend leans towards the more general definition of \"clean eating\". This seems to be almost a lifestyle choice more so than a product classification, Mintel reports. Exercising, having a varied diet or choosing a specific dietary option, eating in a healthy manner- all of this evolving beyond \"just nothing artificial\". \"Clean label\" and natural ingredients go hand-in-handConsumers may describe \"clean food\" as something they can trust, something that is real and close to nature, and something that contains ingredients they are familiar with. Across the globe, food and drink innovations show growth in product launches with natural claims, such as no additives or preservatives, GMO-free, organic, wholegrain, and all-natural. Percentage of product launches a clean label claim*, Associations with \"Clean\"In order to understand what clean label means for consumers, Sensient has conducted primary research with US consumers. The results show that the words \"natural\" and \"extract\" carry a lot of weight in relation to clean labeling. Consumers see \"clean\" as the closest to nature that they can get. In fact, 72% of 1,000 consumers polled that those two words most define \"clean label,\" and 61% believe they can taste the difference.

This perception has become embedded in the buying public's consciousness, so it surely should be addressed in product development and packaging. When participants were asked how they identify the clean label products, the previous findings have been confirmed by these and other similar answers: Natural ExtractsSensient Natural Extracts deliver the authentic taste profiles and functions that consumers insist on, and they do so in a way that supports consumer demand for natural, clean-label products. They can be organic compliant and have the claim of provenance that manufacturers and consumers demand in their products. In addition to the variety of profiles and combinations that can be created from Sensient Natural Extracts, there are many other positives regarding their use: TASTE RETENTION They certainly won't last forever as they are free from preservatives, but their shelf life is more than sufficient for storage and use over a specified manufacturing period.
