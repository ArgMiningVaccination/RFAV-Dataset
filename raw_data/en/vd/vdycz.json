Our detox services have served the community for more than 40 years. Our new Dr. Lucy Sewall Center for Acute Treatment Services will increase access to substance use disorder treatment, serving 4,000 men and women annually and create a link to long-term recovery support. The Dimock's ATS Medical Director, Nurse Manager, Clinical Supervisor, Nursing staff, Recovery Specialist and Case Managers all work togetherto assure that each individual receives a safe, medication-assisted withdrawal within a respectful environment. Medication-assisted withdrawal is offered under the supervision of our medical director and experienced nursing staff. During our clients' stays of up to 14 days, all aspects of clinical treatment are considered and a treatment plan is developed to assess next steps. Clients are then referred on to a less intensive level of care for further treatment. Program protocols include methadone, buprenorphine, clonidine and benzodiazepine detoxification. The detox unit is licensed by the Department of Public Health, Bureau of Substance Abuse Services.
