My name is Dr. Nizar Wehbi and I am the North Dakota State Health Officer . I am here to provide information on House Bill 1511. Ove rall, the bill limits the ability for businesses , group homes, universities, sports teams, correctional facilities, and the health care industry to choose to offer the safest work environment for its employees and the safest environment for customers , students, residents and patients. The bill eliminates three basic tools used to reduce the risk of disease transmission, especially in health care settings. These are: 1.The ability to assess vaccination status 2.The ability to assess or test for immune status 3.The ability to assess post-recovery status Although this bill specifies these three tools cannot be used specifically to assess COVID- 19 status , it needs to be recognized that these tools are basic preventive health principles that form the basis for polic ies that are used routinely for diseases such as hepatitis B, tuberculosis, influenza and others. Both vaccination and natural infection result in immunity for most people. However, the duration of this immunity is not completely understood. Immunity after infection may vary with age, health status, severity of infection and time since infection. A ntibody testing cannot be used to determine immunity, whether or not the immunity is due to natural infection or vaccination . The following should be kept in mind when it comes to antibody testing 1: 1.We don't yet know what level of antibodies is needed to protect against COVID -19 infection. 1 Science Brief: SARS -CoV -2 Infection- induced and Vaccine- induced Immunity | CDC House Bill 1511 Technical Corrections Committee November 9, 2021 121502 2.Results from these tests cannot be used to determine immunity to infection with SARS -CoV-2, including potential future variants of the virus . 3.Th ese tests cannot be used to diagnose a current infection and can cro ss r eact with antibodies to other human coronavirus. Four of these other corona viruses circulate throughout the world and usually cause mild, cold-like illnesses. 4.Receiving the COVID -19 vaccine may cause the test to be positive . 5.Not all people produce detectable antibodies after infection and som e peo ple may experience faster declines in antibody levels leading to negative test results2. 6.Te sting months after infection may lead to positive antibody results, but does not mean the individual is protected for another 12 months. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Infectious Disease Society of America are all in agreement that antibody testing should not be used to determine immunity to SARS -CoV- 2 infections. Peo ple who were previously infected are recommended to be vaccinated 90 days after their infection to ensure they are protected. A study out of Kentucky found that people who were vaccinated after infection were 2.34 tim es less likely to be reinfected3. Among U.S. adults hospitalized with symptoms similar to COVID -19, unvaccinated people who had COVID -19 recently were 5 times more likely to test positive for COVID -19 than people who were recently fully vaccinated.4 T he other specific area I would like to address deal s with testin g frequency . The bill currently restricts testing by employers to a maximum of twice per week. Testing employees can be used to detect infections early and keep infected employees from coming to the workplace. However, people with 2 Predictors of Nonseroconversion after SARS -CoV -2 Infection - Volume 27, Number 9\u2014 September 2021 - Emerging Infectious Diseases journal - CDC 3 Reduced Risk of Reinfection with SARS -CoV-2 After COVID- 19 Vaccination \u2014 Kentucky, May -June 2021 | MMWR (cdc.gov) 4 Laboratory -Confirmed COVID -19 Among Adults Hospitalized with COVID -19-Like Illness with Infection - Induced or mRN A Vaccine- Induced SARS -CoV -2 Immunity \u2014 Nine States, January -September 2021 | MMWR (cdc.gov) 3 COVID -19 are infectious before symptoms start. Frequent testing is the best way to consistently detect infections early. Businesses and health care employers should have the ability to imp lement testing that best works for them to keep staff, customers, residents or patients as safe as possible. For example, if an employee is tested twice in one week, say on Monday and Wednesday, then develops symptoms at work Wednesday afternoon, now the employer would not be able to test the employee, because that employee has already been tested twice. I n conclusion, this bill limits the ability of business, including long term care facilities , congregate care facilities, universities, sports teams, corrections, and health care facilities to operate in a manner that maximizes the safety of patients, residents, staff, and health care providers. Parts of the bill are very restrictive as we learn new information about the dis ease. When testing is an option, that testing should not be limited but be done in a manner that keeps workplaces as safe as possible. The SARS -CoV-2 virus is still evolving , and we still have much to learn about it. The unknowns associated with new virus variant s and the inability to accurately predict transmission in our population warrant a cautious approa ch. We need to be able to respond, if needed , to increasing cases , increasing severity of disease or the ability of the virus to escape either vaccine induced or natural immunity . I would be happy to answer questions at this time. 1221812237120581 H. B. 1511 Joint Technical Corrections Committee November 9 , 2021 Lisa A. Johnson , Vice Chancellor of Academic & Student Affairs, NDUS 701.328.4143 | lisa.a.johnson@ndus.edu Chairs Representative Weisz and Senator Lee and members of the Joint Technical Corrections Committee. My name is Lisa Johnson , and I serve as the Vice Chancellor of Academic and Student Affairs for the North Dakota University System. I am here today on behalf of the University System (but not the State Board of Higher Education, which has not taken a position on this proposed legislation) . To date, the North Dakota University System believes it has successfully navigated the COVID 19 pandemic \u2014permitting campuses to adapt to the changing risk levels in their respective communities using evidence -based practices to mitigate the spread of the virus. Among the roughly 50,000 members of our academic community are individuals who are immune compromised, individuals with close family members that c annot be vaccinated or have under lying health conditions that place them at severe risk , and now, at times, those who have suffered from break through cases of the Delta variant . Our students have been very clear that they have appreciate d the NDUS' efforts to quickly return to in-person instruction while providing online or hybrid accessibility to students who are unable to attend in person. That could not have been accomplished without your foresi ght from earlier this year and the current exemption provided by the legislature that permitted us to responsibly use self -reported student , faculty, and staff data that enabled us to return to in-person instruction as quickly as possible . This was largely accomplished using self -reported data in addition to basic safety protocols like masks, social distancing, smaller class size s and improved air handling systems. Without these approaches, we would not have been able to stop the spread without closing campuses entirely or a modified virtual model of instruction . Because of the exemption provided by you to responsibly use available data that included self - reported vaccine status, test results, and recovery data, we have been able to maintain the safest possible instructional spaces, common areas, and residence halls. Ultimately, the exemption you have provided to date has afforded students the ability to make an informed choice . Using data available to them , students can make the 12132 2 choice to be vaccinated, the choice to remain unvaccinated and to take advantage of regular testing , or for those who live on campus, the ability to quarantine to prevent the spread of the virus should they contract the virus or come in close cont act with someone with the virus. Today the North Dakota University System respectfully requests that the committee recommend retaining Section 1, Subsection 4 of H.B. 1511 (lines 15 -19 on page 2) , which will permit the State Board of Higher Education and its institutions to continue to responsibly use such data to mitigate the negative effects of COVID 19 and any subsequent variations of the virus . Removing the current exemption reduces the campuses' ability to utilize self- reported data to mitigate the spread of COVID 19 . The NDUS is unlike other public entities affected by this legislation because one- fourth to one -third of the students at some NDUS institutions reside on campus, which adds up to between 10,000 and 11,000 students . In addition to being in close contact with others in classrooms, laboratories, and common areas during the day, these stude nts live on the premises \u2014using cafeterias , fitness centers, libraries, and other common spaces. The NDUS and its institution have a responsibility to attend to the health and safety of our students and the greater campus community throug h the course of this pandemic through the use of reasonable, evidence- based procedures. The NDUS respectfully requests your continued support for its ability to mitigate the spread of COVID -19 on campus, including by endorsing the exemption in Section 1, Subsection 4 of H .B. 1511. This concludes my testimony related to H .B. 1511, I stand for questions from Committee members. PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO HOUSE BILL NO. 1511 Page 2, line 15- 19, remove the overstrike over \"Subsection 1 is not applicable to the state board of higher education, the university system, or institutions under the control of the state board of higher education to the extent the entity has adopted policies and procedures governing the type of documentation required, the circumstances under which such documentation may be shared, and exemptions from providing such documentation. \" Renu mber accordingly 12133122171 Joint Technical Corrections Committee HB 1511 November 9, 2021 Chair Lee, Chair man Weisz and Committee Members, my name is Joan Connell. I am a pediatric ian in Bismarck and I'm president of the North Dakota Medical Association's 6th District Medical Society . I present this testimony on behalf of the North Dakota Medical Association. The North Dakota Medical Association is the professional membership organizat ion for North Dakota physicians, residents, and medical students . NDMA opposes this bill based on three main issues, and requests there be an exemption for health care in the bill . First, lines 10 -11 on page 2 should not be crossed out. The exemption for health care providers is incredibly important during times of crisis. It was placed there last session based on the request of health care providers and should remain in law . Hospitals , clinics, and nursing homes take care of the sickest and oldest people, and the requirements regarding COVID -19 vaccination are essential there. Right now, hospitals and clinics do not ask about vaccination status, but at some point, during this pandemic it may become an issue. They should not be prohibited from asking for documentation in case the need arises. Second, the federal exemption language is unclear. Direct financial losses shouldn't need to be proved if a health care provider is under a federal mandate. Late last week CMS issued details on the emergency regulation requiring COVID -19 vaccination for health workers. The regulation covers what most people would consider traditional health care settings, including long term care. Among the information distri buted, it is CMS opinion that under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, this regulation pre - empts any state law to the contrary. U.S. Const. art. VI \u00a7 2. 121232 This CMS regulation is not being challenged at this time, so federal rulings and lawsuits against the Executive Order on Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors or the OSHA COVID -19 Healthcare Emergency Temporary Standar d do not apply. If a facility takes Medicaid or Medicare - which is a large majority in our state - this regulation applies. We would suggest exemption language in the bill deferring to those federal requirements. Third, S ection 2 of the bill, the exemption for vaccine mandates isn't accurate or supported by the evidence. Right now, hospitals requiring a vaccine mandate are offering two exemptions - medical and religious. And both of those are being generously granted. These two exemptions are what is required under federal law and what will be offered for those under the mandate . We would also suggest that federal pre -emption language be placed in section 2 of the bill, because if subject to the federal regulation, the entities must offer only those two exemptions, and not those contained in the bill. The two times a week testing option isn't p ractical, in that COVID -19 tests are hard to come by, and the staff to administer the tests are not available. Further, currently there is no clear evidence to support using antibody testing as a safe alternative to vaccination. We have known since summer 2020 that antibody testing is not reliable due to the high number of false positives . Putting this into legislation would force companies or individuals to pay for something that is not useful and not protective. B ased on what we know now, COVID -19 infecti on provides some protection against reinfection, but we do not know the durability of protection nor the level of protection. When testing for natural antibodies, the presence of antibodies does not necessarily mean one is immune, and the absence of antibo dies does not mean an individual has no immunity. It would not be wise to put into statute the twelve months exemption from immunization when it isn't supported by any science and the actual data to prove immunity is not established. While federal law wil l supersede state law in many instances for COVID -19 vaccine mandates, individual businesses not impacted by federal mandates should have a right to choose if or what mandates are best for their 3 business, and state government should not interfere. NDMA req uests for a DO NOT PASS recommendation on this bill. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I would be happy to answer any questions.

November 9, 2021 RE: HB 1511 and Inclusion of Federal Contractor Exemption Members of the Joint Technical Corrections Committee: We are writing to provide input on North Dakota HB 1511 and request the insertion of language that allows federal contractors to be exempt from the impact of HB 1511. Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota (BCBSND), hea dquartered in Fargo, includes nine offices across the State of North Dakota, with over 900 employees. BCBSND is a federal contractor providing health coverage for federal employees. Noridian Healthcare Solutions, also headquartered in Fargo, ND, is a wholly owned subsidiary of BCBSND and employs over 1,750 staff - more than 1,000 of whom are in North Dakota. Noridian receives over 95% of our $300M annual reve nue from federal government contracts and has supported the Medicare program since its inception in 1966. As contractors to the federal government, BCBSND and Noridian are required to follow the COVID-19 Workplace Safety: Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors (issued September 24, 2021) released by the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force under direction of Executive Order 14042 and signed September 9, 2021. This guidance instructs all federal contractors to require staff to be vaccinated, except for those who request and receive a medical or religious accommodation. Failure by BCBSND and Noridian to comply with Federal law may be deemed a breach of contract, which would allow the federal government to terminate these contracts for cause. In Noridian's case it would result in the loss of employment for nearly all employees. The loss of federal government contracts would be catastrophic to Noridian and not something from which the organization could recover. We respectfully request clear language allowing federal contracts to be exempt from HB 1511. Without that amendment, BCBSND, Noridian, and other North Dakota private businesses with federal contracts, will face a no-win decision a bout which requirements to comply with, federal or state, and thereby decidedly violate the other. Respectfully submitted, Dan Conrad, President and CEO, BCBSND Jon Bogenreif, CEO-elect, Noridian 12204Forcing a medical experiment upon an individual as a condition to participate in society is illegal, unlawful and immoral and reprehensible and it is a violation of our God -given, Natural, and Common Law rights, as expressed and confirmed in the American D eclaration of Independence, and as reflected in the constitution of this state and the constitution of the United States. It doesn't matter whether vaccines work or not. It doesn't matter whether this is even a vaccine or not. What matters is that each individual has sovereignty and authority over their own body. Forced vaccination violates the right to privacy, which is protected, secured and guaranteed by the 4th Amendment of the US and the constitution of this state. I am concerned for the citizens of North Dakota. I am concerned for my children. I am in favor of prohibiting vaccine mandates. I completely oppose vaccine mandates due to religious and moral reasons. Mandates are a complete infringement on one 's personal freedom and liberties as protected by the Bill of Rights. 118661 There is absolutely no reason for the government to mandate any medical treatment against any person's wish. Especially when the survivability rate for the majority of people is so high. If the virus is so dangerous why were people including UND students being bribed to get tested? Once a person has symptoms they need to get tested but not be given items of value to encourage those with no symptoms to get tested as was shown to happen in various area of ND, primarily college campuses . Why were healthcare facilities being paid according to the number of virus related patients? Doesn't this indicate the government was encouraging the claiming of virus patients for monetary rewards? And now the government is mandating a \"vaccine\" for the treatment of a virus they were encouraging people to get tested for when they had no symptoms . Imagine a virus so dangerous that one has to be rewarded for getting tested when there are no symptoms of the virus.According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 is deadliest among older populations. In fact, through February 17, 93 percent of COVID-19 deaths nationwide have occurred among those ages 55 or older. Only 0.2 percent were younger than 25. This trend can also be found on the state level. CDC data also show that Americans, regardless of age group, are far more likely to die of something other than COVID-19. Even among those in the most heavily impacted age group (85 and older), only 13.3 percent of all deaths since February 2020 were due to COVID-19. [ Visual charts for national or by state available : https://datavisualizations.heritage.org/ public-health/covid-19-deaths-by-age/ ] Are we even going to talk about all the people that have been vaccinated that contracted the virus ? why then are vaccines even mandated . Please stop the federal government from taking over the health of North Dakota citizens. If a person has to be told they have symptoms when that person is unaware they are sick makes no sense, especially when the symptoms are so well know . Thank you Ron GibbensDistrict 20 Grand Forks ND 111867Technical Communications Committee Putting something into our bodies should be OUR choice, not forced upon us in order to be able to provide for our families. Having had family members that are still battling ill side effects from the vaccine, I feel very strongly about this. It needs to be each persons CHOICE. I am terrified for my family member who, if forced to get another round, could very well potentially die like many others have. I am asking you to just allow people to make their own medical choice as to what is best for them. This vaccine is not like other vaccines. According to the CDC you can still get and pass covid. So it is not slowing the spread. There have been well over 6000 deaths according to VAERS from the vaccine. Other vaccines have been taken off the market for under 10 deaths. We are forcing our citizens to take this vaccine that does not prevent you from getting or passing covid and has had thousands of deaths and even more adverse reactions all for a virus that has a 99.997% survival rate for ages 0-19, 99.98% for ages 20-49, 99.5% for ages 50-69, and 94.6% for ages over 70. Those percentages are from the CDC. The adverse reactions from the vaccine are nearing 2million. PLEASE go with science and freedom and pass this bill to protect our citizens and loved ones, and allow each individual the freedom to choose. Thank You!11870Vaccine Mandates from a Healthcare Provider's Perspective Dear Legislatures, I am submitting this Testimony in Favor of HB 1510 due to my personal and daily experiences with the COVID-19 vaccine mandates. I urge you to support this bill and here is why. Whether you are for the vaccine or not, it doesn't matter. Mandates are doing more harm than good. They cause psychological reactance from individuals. I have seen people choose not to get the vaccine because they did not like feeling forced; and then go on to die from COVID. Mandates are damaging. Please support HB 1510. Thank you for your time, Hannah11873I am in support of HB 1510. I am a registered nurse and I work fully remote for a health insurance company. I am at risk of being part of a COVID vaccination mandate that will require me to either get the COVID vaccine or lose my car eer. I should not have to choose my career or a medical treatment. I work from home, by myself and I do not travel for work. I do not have in-person contact with my colleag ues or patients. I do not need CPR to do my current job. I do not understand why I could potentially be part of a vaccine ma ndate when I have zero contact with people other than my family and friends. The constant fear tactics placed upon me by my current company has caused undue anxiety and anguish over the possibility of losing my livelihood. I never thought that by going into the nursing field that I would not have job security. I remember my parents alwa ys telling me, become a nurse, you will always have a job! Not anymore. I am pro-vaccine; I have gotten all the other childhood vaccines plus I get my flu shot yearly. I also have vaccinated my children and they are up to date with their vaccines as well. This was my choice and my husband' s choice. There is no more \"choice \" with these mandates. My employer or g overnment should not choose what is best for me medically . If we allow these mandates to happen, what' s next? Are they going to choose what other medications I should or shouldn't be taking? Are they going to choose w hat procedures I get or don't get? Since when has America become a place where you no longer have freedom to choose what is best for you and your family? I am standing up for my medical freedom and that of my family and friends. No one should be coerc ed into getting a medical treatment against their will. I prefer dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery\u2014Thomas Jefferson 1787 11878Do Pass Testimony of Doug Sharbono, citizen of North Dakota on HB 1511 in 2021 Special Session, Sixty -seventh Legislative Assembly of N D Dear Chair s Lee and Weisz and members of the Joint Technical Corrections Committee , I am writing as a citizen and believe HB 1511 is good legislation and ask for a \"Do Pass\" on it . My position is very simple. Individual liberty in obtaining or refusing vaccinations should be retained by the people. It is not suitable that in dictator type style , any bureaucrat or politician be able to force -vaccinate us or coerce us to be vaccinated . This is already unlawfull y federally mandated , which corporations and governments are following . This right of the people needs to be retained. If amendments are considered for this bill, please amend in order to strengthen the rights of the people. Please do pass HB 1511 for the benefit of our citizens in North Dakota . Thank you, Doug Sharbono 1708 9th St S Fargo, ND 58103 11890Members of the Joint Technical Corrections Committee , I respectfully request that you implement prohibitions upon all forms of \"mandates \" as relates to the COVID -19 vaccine s, especially in schools and workplaces. Informed Consent When employers mandate a medical procedure as a condition of employment they are at worst practicing medicine, and at best they coercively breach the medical ethic of informed consent1. As to any prospective new mandate in a school setting, lawmakers should remember that the first US rollout of the polio vaccine2 amongst 200K children triggered 40K polio cases , 200 cases of paralysis, and 10 deaths. New vaccine mandates for school admi ssions should be implemented solely by our legislat ure. A body of legislators is more likely to use prudence when adding a new vaccine requirement , assessing disease risk to children against a safety track record established ov er years , while consulting a diverse set of experts and data . Prohibit ing Employers ' Mandate s Is Not Government Overreach into Private Business . North Dakota law is regularly used to maintain a good business climate that balances the rights of business owners ( a property perspective ) and individuals ( a constitutional rights perspective ). N.D.C.C. provides business law governing discrimination, minimum wages, gender wage parity, rest days, child labor, workplace sanitation, family home ca re exemptions, collective bargaining, environmental quality, and more . Business Cl imate North Dakota 's busines s community relies upon high -caliber talent. In recent years North Dakota has switched from an inbound state to an outbound state3. Talent and businesses are on the move in the US, fleeing states whose public/private environments have degraded quality of life and moving to those with the promise of th e pursuit of happiness and continued freedoms . North Dakota should ensure that health care decisions remain a private matter between the patient and their doct or. Thank you for your consideration. 1 American Medical Association. (n.d.).

Retrieved with modification that testing not be required, that it apply to those reimbursed by federal contract, and extend to all injections, not just COVID. I have worked in healthcare for over 22 years. I have seen the sickest and most vulnerable, and I also see the people who have been injured from pharmaceutical medications and injections. I am not na\u00efve about the ingredients and risks of these intervention s. I am healthy, and like many of my co -workers, I will not choose to inject myself with toxic ingredients looking for a healthy outcome. This coercion didn't start with COVID shots, and it won't stop here either. For far too long, we have accepted that b usinesses could mandate something as ineffective, and yet still dangerous, as a flu shot. Just think about how illogical it is for an employer to require that you inject a foreign substance in your body (a permanent decision) in order to work for them! I am not a slave to my job, so my job doesn't get to decide my health decisions. We need legislation that stands up for MY rights as an employee to make my own health decisions no matter where I work! It is not right to admit that the shots can't be requir ed, but then in case of an emergency or for federal contract or payment, that right is void. Healthcare workers need the same rights against all coerced injections! These mandates are not about health, but control. I am no more likely to be a carrier of a virus than my vaccinated co -workers or patients, so it makes no sense to require that I test frequently (and pay for the test myself). The COVID shots do not prevent transmission or infection, so even if you have gotten the shots, you are at no lesser ri sk for getting it and spreading it. We need to support the workers, especially healthcare workers, that didn't work from home but instead worked with the sickest amongst us ---before there was even an option for the shot. We have constant shortages in heal thcare and making excuses for mandating their health decisions will only make the shortages worse. STAND UP FOR OUR FREEDOM TO MAKE OUR OWN HEALTH DECISIONS! Erin McSparron Occupational Therapist 11912As of January 1 of 2022 my place of employment will be laying off employees if not vaccinated 11923Please support HB 1511 to defend the health freedom of North Dakota citizens. Thank you, Tanya Watterud Minot ND 11933I support HB1511 at its core and also want to see it strengthened to protect the citizens of North Dakota. To protect it from Federal and private entities that wish to force vaccinations onto unwanted individuals. This should be an easy thing. Forcing an individual to take anything against their will that would change their bodies or health is unethical. Without this bill and protections to citizens of North Dakota I could lose my job because of my vaccination status. Health is a personal right and should not be able to compromise by an employer or any other entity. I strongly urge the legislature to take up this bill and pass it. Matt Schramm 11946I have an anaphylactic allergy to the ingredients in the Covid vaccine. In certain states, I am not allowed to enter a restaurant, grocery store, or venue without proof of vaccination. My allergist has recommended no one in my household be vaccinated. My freedoms, guaranteed to me by the Constitution, are gone in those states! Let 's not make the great state of North Dakota one of those states! 11957I am asking you to support this bill. An employer should not be forced to require a vaccine or any documentation from their employee. This should be freedom of choice. 11968Dear Joint Technical Corrections Committee: I am writing in SUPPORT of HB 151 1 Relating to employer -required COVID -19 vaccinations; relating to limitations on requiring documentation of COVID -19 vaccinations, antibodies, and post -transmission recovery status; relating to limitations on requiring documentation Medical interventions are not a one size fits all. Everyone has different genetics, health history, underlying health conditions, etc. Just because 1 person is \"fine\" fro m a vaccine doesn't mean everyone will be \"fine\". I am vaccine injured as well as both of my children. Vaccine injuries are not rare and should not be ignored. We can also discuss the fact that Vaccine Manufactures are not liable if you do get a reaction, which should be known. There are numerous studies out there that can be reviewed, but I will keep my testimony brief. Please pass this bill to protect ND citizens from being coerced into a one size fits all intervention that no one is liable for if there is a reaction. Thank you for all your hard work and for your time. Jocelyn Backman District 13 11986I am in support of HB 1511. I am a registered nurse who works from home for a large health insurance company. I am at risk to lose my career and livelihood over a COVID vaccination mandate. I should not be forced to choose my personal health decisions over providing for my family financially. I was widowed with two young children. Being forced to take an experimental \"vaccine\" with unknown health risks is against my human rights. The thought of a potential unknown severe physical illness/reaction to this experimental \"vaccine\" which may take the only healthy parent my children have from them terrifies me. Who will guarantee my health? Who will provide and care for my two young children if I'm physically unable to? I will add I am not an anti-vaxxer. Myself and my children have been given all other routine vaccinations and I have drawn titers to determine our level of protection. I am educated in the healthcare field and have 15 years of experience as a registered nurse. I believe that this experimental \"vaccine\" is not safe in the current state and everyone deserves the freedom to choose to take it or refuse it. 1199467th Legislative Assembly Special 2021 Session Joint Technical C orrection Representatives, I am in full support of HB 1511. It is a good bill and should be passed. I urge this 67th Special Session to support M edical Freedom in North Dakota , this is the right thing to do . I do not w ant any mandates in North Dakota , a mandate is not law and I will not Comply. I believe a business does not have the legal authority to ask me if I have gotten the shot . I do think there will be law suits coming and I think these businesses will lose the lawsuit and will end up losing business. I hope a business in North Dakota does not do this because in the end I do think there will be a sign in their window (Going Out of Business ). To avoid costly lawsuits and avoiding a business going out of busine ss, pass HB 1511 . We th e People of North Dakota will be watching and please do not Water Down these bills , in fact if possible , make them stron ger. Thank Y ou, Gordon Greenstein US Navy (Veteran) US Army (Retired) 11996Hello Senators and Representatives, I hope you vote yes for all of these bills. They are very important to me. There has been discrimination against people who have not taken the vaccine and that is wrong. Whether or not to have a vaccine should be a choice and you should not be discriminated for not having it. Having to disclose what vaccines we have had or not had is against HIPPA. We should not be discriminated for not disclosing our medical records.

There is no reason a person should be discriminated against based on vaccine or immunity status of ANY age. By looking at the number of North Dakotans who showed up to the Capitol yesterday it is clear that We the People do not want the government to decide what is best for ourselves and our families. This is a personal choice, and we are in charge of our bodies and what goes in to them-NOT the government. Please support this bill. Thank you, Stephanie large Power Company in North Dakota . As of three weeks ago 62% of all of our employees have not been vaccinated. No doubt that number has decreased by now . But I've spoken to several employees who will be refusing the v accine and are at risk of losing their jobs and you loosing a portion of your tax base. These employees are heads of departments , supervisors, li nemen, electricians, etc. Some of them have large, home -schooled fami lies with a single income .

Vaccinations are a personal choice. Our forefathers created our Spirit written Constitution for America to protect our God Given Rights - and by voting YES to support these bills, YOU will be adding another layer of protection to ALL ND citizens. Let's show the world that we stand for God, Freedom, and our USA Constitution by leading as an example! VOTE YES for Measures 1510 and 1511 to protects all residents. Thank you, Melissa Gjermundson 12038My name is Michelle Haley and I am a current employee of Eli Lill y, a pharmaceutical company based out of Indianapolis, Indiana. January 2nd would be m y 20 year anniversary. I have worked in different roles from my home in Bismarck the entire time covering multiple states during my career. On Monday, November 15, I will lose my employment , my pension, stock, company car and a career I have worked very har d to build! On August 12, our CEO announced a mandatory vaccination policy which no longer allo wed for proof of antibodies, masks or social distancing, wh ich had been acceptable for the five months prior. We were all owed to submit a religious or medical exemption by September 13th. Myself and a number of m y colleagues submitted our sincerely held religious beliefs , despite feeli ng completely violated sharing such personal, deeply held spiritual beliefs. On September 29, we were granted a \"temporar y religious approval\" to continue to do our jobs until November 15 , along with the demand we must find a remote position with in the company to con tinue employment if we did not get vaccinated. At the time of this letter, there were four, yes four, remote positions in the entire compan y, which has over 12,000 US based employees. As you can imagine, I, along with my colleagues, are completely devastated , frustrated, broken hearted and flat out ANGRY! Somehow w e are able to continue to do our jobs in our current capacity until November 15, when we magically become an \"undue hardship on the business\"! The kicker in this scenario is that I currently work 80% from home and worke d completely virtually for 12 months, but miraculously I'm a \"hardship\" to my employ er. I was blessed with a robust immune system that still has antibodies from fighting off a previous infection, but this proof is no longer acceptable. I am not a health r isk to anyone and am not an \"undue hardship on the business\". There are currently 91 peer reviewed studies that demonstrate antibodies are equal to or greater than any pro tection from a ny of the Emergency Use Authorization vaccines. If these treatments w ere as efficacious as they were originally belie ved to be, liability shields would not still be in place to prevent liability for every one of the manufactu rers. This is not about health and it never has been! This is a bout control! This is about companies receiving federal funding a nd needing to have a vaccination rate at a certain percentage to maintain receiving those funds! I urge all of you to ask yourselves , \"When will this stop? How many boosters will be needed next? What will be the next experimental treatment needed to provide for your family?\" Please support this legislation that allows for every North Dakota citizen to make their own medical decisions. I ask to support strong enough language to protect the North Dakota citizens that are employed by out of state companies , as well as in state business es. I look forward to the day when we can look at our friends, family, neighbors and acquaintances and see them as the person they are instead of a vaccination status! Thank you for your time. Michelle Haley 1204212045Citizen testimony on HB1511 November 9, 2021 Scott Whaley - Mandan, ND The core of any discussion regarding vaccine mandates and related bills must be fundamental human rights. Do you agree or disagree that a human being has the right to reject the insertion of a substance into her body? The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article III adopted by the United Nations in 1948 states: \"Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person.\" What is more elemental to liberty and security of person than the right to abstain from injection of a foreign substance into one's body? No matter how noble the cause suggested, at the most basic level we are talking about forcing substances into others who oppose it with every fiber of their being. This is not about unjust restrictions on employers' rights as some have suggested. This is about affirming that we as North Dakotans and Americans believe in the most basic of human rights. It is We the People, not we the employees. A vaccine mandate is not a dress code. It is the injection of manufactured substances into a person's body, potentially against her will. And the essence of a human right is that it applies to all people - regardless of religion or occupation. Are nurses and long-term care providers less human than lawyers or politicians? 'Take the shots or we take your livelihood' is not a choice. 'Inject your children or they'll be cast aside' is inhumane. 'Show me your private medical information or be exhiled' is un-American. It is a shame that Representative Ertelt's bill 21.1114.02000 was not advanced by the Delayed Bills committee, but it is not too late to embrace the simplicity and the equality for all afforded by that bill which was modeled after North Dakota law that stood for over 50 years. Refer to the 16th Assembly Regular Session, Chapter 236 - Vaccination from the year 1919 at the height of the pandemic a century ago. I implore you to act and to encourage your fellow legislators to affirm that North Dakota is a state that fights for the fundamental human rights of its citizens. 12050To the Legislative Assembly: As a citizen of the State of North Dakota, I am reaching out to show my support of HB 1511. As elected representatives of We the People, I am asking you all to listen to the citizens you represent and vote in support of HB 1511. Sincerely, Jenna Bachman 12053Members of the Joint Technical Corrections Committee , I respectfully request that you implement prohibitions upon all forms of \"mandates \" as relates to the COVID -19 vaccine s, especially in schools and workplaces. Informed Consent When employers mandate a medical procedure as a condition of employment they are at worst practicing medicine, and at best they coercively breach the medical ethic of informed consent1. As to any prospective new mandate in a school setting, lawmakers should remember that the first US rollout of the polio vaccine2 amongst 200K children triggered 40K polio cases , 200 cases of paralysis, and 10 deaths. New vaccine mandates for school admi ssions should be implemented solely by our legislat ure. A body of legislators is more likely to use prudence when adding a new vaccine requirement , assessing disease risk to children against a safety track record established ov er years , while consulting a diverse set of experts and data . Prohibit ing Employers ' Mandate s Is Not Government Overreach into Private Business . North Dakota law is regularly used to maintain a good business climate that balances the rights of business owners ( a property perspective ) and individuals ( a constitutional rights perspective ). N.D.C.C. provides business law governing discrimination, minimum wages, gender wage parity, rest days, child labor, workplace sanitation, family home ca re exemptions, collective bargaining, environmental quality, and more . Business Cl imate North Dakota 's busines s community relies upon high -caliber talent. In recent years North Dakota has switched from an inbound state to an outbound state3. Talent and businesses are on the move in the US, fleeing states whose public/private environments have degraded quality of life and moving to those with the promise of th e pursuit of happiness and continued freedoms . North Dakota should ensure that health care decisions remain a private matter between the patient and their doct or. Thank you for your consideration. 1 American Medical Association. (n.d.).

I am submitting this testimony in support of House Bill 1511, with recommendations. Vaccinations are a personal medical decision that must be respected. Any judgement placed on a person with an opposing believe is discrimination. Personal medical decisions should not be required to gain employment or receive services from public entities. Under Section 2, 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c the use of the word \"shall\" is problematic. \"Shall\" gives the impression that it is suggested and not a requirement. I recommend changing the word \"shall\" to \"must\" in all three subsections. Furthermore, a penalty for non-compliance is not laid out. There must be a legal recourse or penalty for not complying with this law. A \"do pass\" on HB 1511, with edits is recommended. 12065Members of the Joint Technical Corrections Committee, I respectfully request that you implement prohibitions upon all forms of \"mandates \" as relates to the COVID-19 vaccines, especially in schools and workplaces. Mandates are not a solution as a one size fits all. Employers and schools need to respect citizens rights to free choice for ourselves and children. An exemption should be honored for all. The vaccinated need not fear the unvaccinated because after all, the are supposedly already immune to covid. After over a year and a half we are still in division and pitted against each other which needs to stop for our communities and our commerce and our State. It would seem we are media fear driven and that narrative - it would seem - will not stop. This bill will calm all concerned. Thank you for your consideration.12085Dear Legislators of ND, I am writing this testimony on behalf of am currently in support of prohibiting the teaching of critical race theory, I do not believe on these liberal ideals being pushed off on our children, just like I disagree with several sexual education perspectives being pushed. As a parent, it is my job to educate my children how I see fit, and I already feel that liberals are pushing their agenda through the public school system. HB 1510 -I am currently feeling very discriminated against for not getting the vaccine not only from employers in my area, but also from several doctors who are pushing this vaccine on me. I feel like I have lost my freedom of choice, and speech. I have had people comment nasty things on social media about me as a professional simply because of my beliefs in freedom of choice. As a person who has been infected and recovered from covid, I see no need for being forced into a vaccination that has no real approval or research, especially for pregnant women like myself. HB 1511 -This ties into my response to HB 1510, again, a s a person who has already been infected and recovered from covid I do not feel the need to be vaccinated. I am fed up with employers, doctors, even my own patients that feel they have a right to my protected health information, or worse yet, feel as if they can impose a forced vaccination which still does not stand up to reinfection like my antibodies do. HCR 3049 - As a person that works with families everyday as a career, I find it troubling that parents right to decide for their children when it comes t o ANYTHING is at risk. Parents have the right to make the decision for their children until they are adults and can make the decisions for themselves. This is in regard to aspects such as schooling, vaccinations, and overall health decisions. This is what parents are supposed to do...one could argue that it is their jobs. We are forcing kids to wear masks that affect their overall learning, social skills, and mental health with no regards to these things because \"at least they won't get covid\" or forcing chil dren to get vaccinated so they can attend school (a vaccine that has no backing until the year 2023, but that doesn't matter to big companies or pharmaceuticals as long as they are making money). Here is a final statement I would like to leave here, for legislators, governors, and senators alike...don't forget who you work for. WE THE PEOPLE.

Thanks, Saje Backman #12090Good afternoon, I am writing this testimony regarding both HB1510 and HB1511. My name is Miki Thompson. My family reside s in Dickinson, in District 37 currently. I was at the capital yesterday and had the chance to speak to my representatives personally. My husband works in the oilfield, with a subcontractor and has been in the oilfield for many years. He has weathered two booms and busts. The patch here is set to ramp up once again. And with that comes revenue for our state. I urge you to pass a bill that protects our state's hardworking employees, as well as the rights of our hardworking business owners. I understand the ND Petroleum Council is urging the legislature to focus on the spending bills and redistricting bills and bypassing any policy bills regarding mandated vaccines. I find that decision on the council's part to be rash and ill informed, and without any input from the oilfield employees or subcontractor businesses whatsoever . Without these mandate prote ctions, workers will move to states that have already made protecting their workforce and businesses a priority. North Dakota's main source of revenue is oil extraction and production taxes. Without these workers or subcontracting businesses there will be no oil patch. We want North Dakota's oilfield to be the best in the nation. Not only in production, but in the high quality of life and work we provide here. With that being said, I urge you to pass laws protecting our great state's livelihoods. I suggest combining Representative Paulson's HB 1510, and Representative Meier's proposed bill, into Representative Weisz' bill. Offering the strongest protection for years to come. I also recommend the wording changed to ANY vaccine. And shall allow exemptions be changed to must allow exemptions. We also need hiring protections, as well as termination protection. Job security and stability does play a huge role when workers move to a state. Please protect our oilfield and our state's future revenue that the oilfield will yield . I thank you for your time and your service. Please enjoy this beautiful North Dakota fall day. Thank You, Miki Thompson Dickinson, ND HB 1511. Vaccine mandate s diminish our fre edom as citizens to make our ow n health care decisions. The idea of mandating newly developed trial va ccines for children to take part in school is also ludicrous! Please hear our plea for freedom .

BISMARCK BOTTINEAU DEVILS LAKE FARGO GRAND FOR KS JAMESTOWN MINOT MOORHEAD VALLEY CITY www. annecarlsen.org Position Statement on COVID Vaccine Employer Decision Making November 3rd, 2021 Employers in North Dakota, especially those in the health care and human service fields, are in the best position to determine how to keep employees and the people they serve safe. Health care and human services providers are already one of the most highly regulated industries by the state and federal government, and Anne Carlsen opposes additional regulation by the state limiting its ability to implement best practices designed to keep the people they serve and their employees safe. We provide care for some of the most vulnerable children in the state, and we are currently serving 10 children and young adults who are on ventilators, and others who are immunocompromised. In addition to their medical challenges, many are also ineligible based on age to rece ive the vaccine, and so have very limited protections . We've shared with our staff that our intent is not to infringe on staff's personal freedoms or medical decision making, however, we have a moral and ethical responsibility to ensure to the best of our abilities that we keep the individuals we serve and those who support them safe, healthy, and protected from this virus . This is best achieved by abiding by the best evidence -based medical practices, including vaccination for highly transmissible diseases like COVID 19. The state taking away our ability to require our valued and already impacted workforce to get vaccinated compromises our ability to keep the people we serve safe a nd to keep our remaining workforce healthy. For Anne Carlsen, we must take situations like this very seriously because children's lives hang in the balance with these decisions. It also likely compromises our ability to participate in the Medicaid program , which is the critical safety net program for nearly all the children and families we serve. Compromising our participation in Medicaid would be devastating to our organization and could seriously jeopardize our ability to continue the work and legacy of this 80 -year-old organization.

My wife - having been a state registered CNA at a local assisted living facility here in Dickinson, was recently terminated due to her unwillingness to accept the vaccine. (Fired 11-1-2021 Agemark Corporation) As we have both already had Covid, which she contracted at work, and both tested positive by state run testing facilities, the vaccine offers only risk with no benefit to either of us. Having applied for unemployment this week- she was denied benefits for INSUBORDINATION. We feel this is unconstitutional, and a definite overreach by private companies operating in our state, and ask that you protect us from our out of control federal government. We are decent, hard working North Dakota citizens, who simply want our basic civil rights protected. Thank you for your consideration. James and Judith Corcoran 984 12th ave west Dickinson ND 58601 701300009911868Good afternoon, Rep. Weisz , Senator Lee and members of the Technical Corrections Committee. My name is Kylie Hall, and I am a resident of District 45 in North Fargo. I have a Master's Degree in Public Health and I am a passionate vaccine advocate with more than 6 years of professional public health experience . I have a number of concerns about the bill before us today, mostly related to unintended consequences. I'll try to be brief in my talking points today. If this bill were passed, we could no long er ask about COVID -19 status or require testing for individuals or groups. I think about long -term cares or group homes requiring COVID -19 testing for entry in times of outbreak or high community transmission. I also think about screening school or univers ity students during an outbreak, this bill says we cannot make people disclose their COVID -19 status. There are other groups that would be impacted. Think of the department of corrections or the state hospital or other entities that are at high risk for e xposure to COVID -19 and that may experience outbreaks or benefit from vaccination. I also want to touch on the economic impact of this mandate. This bill may limit which events, whether it be concerts, sporting events or conferences, that require vaccinati on or negative tests could occur in ND. There are many examples in Fargo of concerts that require vaccination or a negative test for attendance. These events have a big impact on the economy. Not only do events like this include ticket sales, but they brin g in people to stay in hotels, eat in our restaurants, ride in our taxi services, and shop in our communities. I think it's also important to note that these businesses have weather ed a pandemic, and to further punish them financially with these requiremen ts would be brutal. Another point in this bill prevents private businesses from requiring patrons or customers to provide proof of vaccination, COVID antibodies or COVID status to gain entry or receive services. BUSINESSES should be able to decide if they want to require vaccines or COVID testing status for customers. If people don't like it, they won't support that business. The free market will determine whether or not that is a sustainable move for the business. It might actually move more people to supp ort a business, or it may harm the business. Regardless, businesses should be able to decide if they want to protect their staff and their business from COVID disruptions. The free market will decide the rest. With the way the bills are written, it ultima tely comes down to business autonomy. In a state like ND, where many legislators claim to believe in small government, we need to remind them that that means businesses should be able to decide whether or not they want to require vaccines for their employe es and patrons. Blocking vaccine requirements at the state level seems like an overreach of government. Here's why we think businesses should be able to require vaccines for their employees or patrons. Since the start of the pandemic, COVID -19 outbreaks w ithin businesses have led to business closures and lost productivity. One example from early in the pandemic is when LM 11872windpower in GF had to close because of an outbreak among its employees. Another example is from two weeks ago, when a Walmart in Dickin son closed due to COVID. It is important to understand that in some situations, ensuring a vaccinated workforce may be good for business. In healthcare we need people to work and they can't be sick. In a production line or food processing facility , we need employees for the business to operate. It's understandable that businesses may want to limit COVID -19 outbreaks and disruptions in business. Businesses many determine that the best way to protect the health of their employees and those they serve is for e mployees to be vaccinated. Businesses should decide if they will offer accommodations to those who do not wish to be vaccinated. Exemptions to COVID -19 vaccine requirements and exceptions for previous infection should be up to each business and not based o n state law. While federal law will supersede state law in many instances for COVID -19 vaccination requirements, individual businesses not impacted by federal mandates should have a right to choose if or what vaccination requirements are best for their bus iness, and state government should not interfere. Other reason businesses may want their employees to be vaccinated is the cost of health care and health insurance. Businesses and their employees may pay more for health insurance because of substantial hea lthcare costs associated with COVID -19. We know that unvaccinated individuals are more likely to test positive for COVID -19, are more likely to suffer from severe COVID, be hospitalized from COVID -19, and die from COVID -19. We also know that the average CO VID- 19 hospitalization costs more than $20,000 , and hospitalizations requiring a ventilator are much higher. As a means of preventing severe disease and keeping healthcare costs low, businesses may consider mandating COVID -19 vaccine for employees. Now I want to touch on healthcare worker vaccine mandates. Mandating vaccines for healthcare workers is a common policy that was initially prompted by a dual de sire to protect patients from health care -acquired influenza and to protect the workplace from the disruption and expense of worker illnesses. As we consider COVID -19 vaccination, I think you can make an even stronger case for why vaccination is important. COVID is more serious, it spreads easier, it causes significant disruptions in healthcare delivery, the vaccines are much more effective, and ultimately - the vaccines are very safe. We know that immunization requirements for employees in healthcare help boost immunization rates among staff, they protect our healthcare workers, and that ultimately also protects the patients being served . And we know that vaccinated healthcare workers are less likely to get COVID -19 than unvaccinated healthcare workers. Even if parts of this legislation get through, we need to strongly consider exempting healthcare and long -term care from state laws regarding employer vaccine requirements. Other important t hings to note are that many healthcare systems require influenza vaccination, in addition to proof of immunity to hepatitis B and measles. Some staff members are required to be vaccinated against rabies and meningitis. Tuberculosis testing is also commonpl ace for healthcare workers. These requirements are not new, but COVID would expand the list of requirements and help protect staff and patients. Much talk has been given to antibody testing as a means of bypassing vaccination. Let's talk about what we kno w about natural immunity and antibody testing. Following infection with the virus that causes COVID -19, many individuals will have immunity. However, it is unknown how long immunity lasts following natural infection , and it is currently impossible to predi ct who will and who won't develop immunity . It is important to note that infection with other identified coronaviruses does not confer lifelong protection. We do know that reinfections are possible, although they are very unlikely in the 90 days following infection, and the CDC has updated this to say that reinfections are uncommon 6 months out. North Dakota has documented 2,038 reinfections since March 2020. Over half of those reinfections have occurred in the last four and a half months, when the Delta variant became the dominant strain circulating in North Dakota. Because of waning immunity and variants - vaccination will be more important than ever. To determine immunity, people often look to antibody testing. Current recommend ations do not support using antibody testing to determine immunity, as antibody levels do decline over time and the correlates of protection (the level of antibodies needed to be considered \"immune\") are unknown. Of note, not all individuals recovering fro m COVID will have detectable antibodies. The presence of antibodies does not necessarily mean one is immune, and the absence of antibodies does not mean an individual has no immunity. In the future, antibody tests may be developed to ascertain who is and isn't immune. You want that. I want that. This is where we are hoping to get. But we aren't. there yet. Knowledge of SARS -CoV -2 and COVID -19 is growing each day and recommendations, such as those regarding protection following natural immunity, may change . It is irresponsible to implement a state law that is not based on the current recommendations or flexible enough to reflect changes that will come as the science evolves. For instance, scientists may determine that antibody tests need to be repeated more frequently than what is included in this bill to accurately determine immunity. This bill, as written, will likely be outdated within weeks or months of its passage. As a means to provide individuals and our communities with high levels of protection aga inst COVID -19, individuals who have previously tested positive for the virus that causes COVID -19 should receive COVID -19 vaccine. Studies have shown a significant increase in antibodies for individuals who were previously infected and subsequently receive d COVID -19 vaccines. This may lead to longer and better protection. Vaccine requirements are for businesses to ask everyone to take all necessary steps to decrease their chance of COVID. We know vaccines aren't perfect. We know prior infection isn't perfec t. But a layered approach gives us the best protection possible. This is what we want businesses to be able to do. I'll add this quote from an op -ed published last week about the role of vaccine requirements in keeping everyone healthy. \"Incidentally, the fact that breakthrough infections happen - that some people get the virus despite being vaccinated - actually strengthened the case for mandates, because it means that even those who've gotten their shots face some danger from those who refuse to follow su it.\" I want to end by telling you a story about a North Dakota -based business that has implemented a vaccine requirement as a condition of employment. Tellwell is a Fargo Video Production and Marketing Agency owned by Max Kringen. Max was unable to attend today due to other commitments and the expedited schedule of this special session. Tellwell has required COVID - 19 vaccines as a condition of employment, and the requirement went into effect on October 15th. The vaccine requirement was announced months before the deadline. In September of this year, an unvaccinated employee came to work and infected over half of the staff. Six people total tested positive out of 11 total staff. The result of this outbreak was $12,000 in lost revenue out of a mont hly revenue stream of approximately $80,000, and it meant this small business was not profitable for quarter 3 of 2021. For the health of his business and the health of his employees, Max wants to do everything possible to prevent another outbreak of COVID -19 in the workplace . So he has required vaccinations with some accommodations. This is his right, and it should be the right of all private business owners. Max has reported that no one quit as a result of the requirement, no work has been interrupted, an d most vaccinated employees are thankful for the requirement, as it promotes a safe work environment. We often hear from a vocal minority who do not like vaccination requirements, but there are a number of individuals who feel safer at work because those around them are vaccinated. Businesses should have the right to decide if they want to require vaccinations as a condition of employment or as a condition of receipt of services. Thank you for your time and consideration. I am opposed to employers in the state requiring documentation of COVID-19 vaccinations, antibodies. The citizens of the state of ND should have the freedom to make their own decision whether or not they choose to vaccinate themselves. 11885Page 1 of 1 Carl Young Family Services Network Inc. Executive Director Lobbyist Badge Number 136 Bismarck, Chair Lee , Members of the Committee. I am writing today in opposition to HB 15 11. I object to HB1511 . It is a means of government overreach. We need to work toward the Greater Good. For the Greater Good, we should be advocating that more people receive the vacci ne as appropriate to their situation and i n consultation with their medical provider. How does this legislation do that? While I do agree that discrimination in any form , for any reason is wrong, I also believe that this legislation will hamper the snails progress that we have made in recovering from the Covid -19 pandemic. 11887HB 1511 Employers have the right to require their employees to be vaccinated in order to prote ct their colleagues, customers, and patients I am opposed to HB 1511 for the following chain of reasons: (1)The evidence that individuals not vaccinated against COVID -19 are those currently perpetuating the pandemic as it circu lates among those non -immune persons, (2)And that COVID -19 is highly contagious, and deadly to ove r 800,000 Americans already, (3) And that since 1905 states have had the right to require (but not forbid) a vaccine mandate in order to do their constitutional duty to guard the general welfare of the public, (4) And that workplaces bring people in close contact a nd are responsible for spreading the virus to unknowing colleagues and customers, (5) And, because a free market allows the employer to implement policies and requirements that they want to,(6) And finally, North Dakota is a \"right to work state, \" so individuals opposing the vaccine have the right to find another job. (7) Therefore, please vote down HB 1511 . Mark A. Strand 2208 ND 11989In regard to HB 1511 I oppose this bill, as I believe the majority of ND citizens do. Covid -19 is the most disruptive public health crisis of our lives. The way to end it is through vaccination of as many people as possible. Just as you may disagree the federal governme nt has right to tell us what TO do, I believe the legislature has no business telling people or business es what they CANNOT do! Please k ill this bill. 12026I am strongly opposed to Covid-19 mandates. Vaccination status is a private matter and a choice that needs to be granted to each individual. Those that choose to be vaccinated are protecting themselves and need not be concerned about others who choose not to be vaccinated, as that non-vaccinated individual is only eecting themselves. Employers have no place requiring employees to be vaccinated as the only person the vaccine aects in the individual that gets it. The adverse reactions from a vaccine could aect the employee, and neither the employer nor the pharmaceutical company accept any responsibility for those problems. This bill is a drastic overreach of government power and should not be implemented. Thank you, Joel Dennis 701-340-319712031Testimony to the Joint Technical Corrections Committee Testimony by Barbara Frydenlund Rolette County Public Health District Administrator Good afternoon, Chairman Weisz, and members of the Joint Technical Corrections Committee. My name is Barbara Frydenlund, and I am the Nurse Administrator for Rolette County Public Health District. I am offering this testimony today regarding HB 1510 a nd HB1511. As a Regi stered Nurse and a mother of two, I ask policy makers to follow the science of immunology, vaccination, a nd disease prevention. Our communities, state and nation will be a safer place once everyone has access to science based, competent health care and access to all authorized/ approved vaccines. You are aware that there are several vaccine preventable diseases. Many of t hese diseases have never been seen by today's healthcare providers and parents, in part because for years we have been actively educating parents and guardians and vaccinating children and adults . History is said to repeat itself ! A very wise man told me years ago th at \"those who do not remember or recognize the past will surely repeat it!\" This wise man was my grandfather who witnessed firsthand the tragedy of the 1918 flu pand emic, as he and the local doctor drove from house to house , via horse and buggy , helplessly witnessing death after death from what is now known as a vaccine preventable disease. Let us not relive the tragedy endured by our ancestors, of the untimely deaths at the hands of what we now know as vaccine preventable diseases. Groundbreaking medical victories c ontinue to provide American's with this high health standard. Immunizations are among the most cost -effective and successful public health interventions. This fall we have seen an uptick in the number of children and adults contracting COIVD 19. A casual glance around our state d emonstrates a significant decrease in COVID mitigation measures including masking. In 2020 and early 2021 we protected our children at a higher level than we are currently. From a local public health administration view point I strongly believe that it is my responsibility to protect my workforce and our clients from disease inclu ding 12033vaccine preventable diseases. We are already facing workforce challenges and additional loss of employees who are out of the of fice \"ill\" further hampers our ability to serve our citizens. North Dakota Legis lation is of extreme importance to Rolette County Public Health District as we continue to work diligently to deliver the highest level of disease protection, promotion of healthy lifestyles and protection of the environment. Please cont inue to allow Rolette County Public H ealth District to retain the authority to set local po licy that best suits our environment and culture. Sincerely, Barbara Frydenlund, RN Nurse Administrator Rolette County Public Health District Joint Technical Corrections Committee - HB 1511 Representative Robin Weisz and Senator Judy Lee, Chairs November 9, 2021 Chairs Weisz and Lee: My name is Brian Ritter and I am the President of the Bismarck Mandan Chamber EDC. Please accept the following testimony on behalf of our organization's nearly 1,200 members in opposition of HB 1 511. Our organization engages in a number of activities on behalf of our members to support the continued growth and development of our community; all of which have been impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. As our communit y and our businesses return to 'normal ' they face many new questions, including t hose surrounding vaccinations and the vaccination status of their employees. These a re incredibly complicated and impactful questions that will require time to fully vet, as will any legislati on that seeks to address them. Given the lack of time available during the special session for a comprehensive review of legislation like this , that could im pact a private employer 's ability to make related determinations for t hemselves, we oppose HB 151 1. Respectfully, Brian Ritter, President Bismarck Mandan 12055Dear Sirs and Madams of the ND Legislator: Hello, I would like to start by thanking you all for your service in government. My name is Shaundi Meyer. I have worked in the medical eld for 20 years. I feel that in my years of health care work, I have learned a lot, studied more, and always had my ears and eyes open. Wherever I worked, I took it as an opportunity to learn, and I never stopped asking questions. I was a CNA and a Doula (a birthing assistant or coach) when I lived in Oregon. I worked with Certied Nurse Midwives and OB/GYNs. There I studied homeopathy and herbal remedies. I also studied massage and aromatherapy to assist in my work as a Doula. I volunteered to work with addicted moms living in a treatment facility, mothers who had HepC, HepB, and HIV. So I am no stranger to dangerous, infectious diseases. I also completed training for phlebotomy at LCC. We then moved back home to Bismarck. I began working as a phlebotomist at Med Center 1, and continued working there during the whooping cough epidemic in 2004. I began school for Surgical Technology, but an accident in 2005 forced me to drop my courses. I had a complete fracture of my right foot-I tore through 30 ligaments, essentially breaking my foot in half. I had wanted to become a surge tech and hopefully go back to school to become a Critical Care Nurse or work in trauma. But the accident took me o my feet for eight years on and o. After ten surgeries, I was able to get back on my feet. That is when I became an employee at CHI St. Alexius in Bismarck, and have worked there for 7 1/2 years-I started as a CNA, until I injured my shoulder. For the last 6 years I have worked at the switchboard and at the Information Desk. We help a lot of patients, visitors, and sta. As of right now my job is in jeopardy, because my medical exemptions were denied. My doctor wrote both letters on formal letterhead, and included everything they had asked for. The rst letter stated due to underlying medical conditions, she was advising against the vaccine. That letter was denied and they demanded a new letter, so she wrote one that said I had anaphylactic responses to the flu vaccine, and it was denied. Both letters are in their third review-every time I get denied I have two weeks to give them more information. I have worked the frontline from the beginning of this pandemic, and have worked in high-risk exposure situations, so I am no stranger to PPE, and disease. I was told to put a mask on and screen patients and visitors. I was exposed to covid numerous times and I caught covid because CHI St. Alexius did not provide the proper eye gear that would t over my glasses. The patient had a smokers cough and was not wearing their mask properly when I bent over to hear their question, they coughed into the side of my face-and into my eye. I was told to go to Menards and buy a pair-because they could not give me a pair like Radiology or Surgery would wear (the ones that worked over my glasses) as they claimed they did not have enough. After I came back from having covid, I called Central Supply, told the worker what happened, and I received a pair of eye protection, with a package of extra replacement plastic lenses, that worked over my glasses. When news came out about a vaccine, my instant reaction-the vaccine would kill me. I am extremely allergic to latex and that the small amount of natural rubber latex in the cap of the vaccine vials would cause an anaphylactic reaction, as I have had before to other medications in the same vials. I was also afraid that my immune system would flare up-I have an autoimmune disorder-arthritis, and a nerve condition called CRPS or by its old name-RSD. My nervous system is in overdrive from an accident years ago, the sympathetic nerves flare up-causing severe pain, tendinitis, temperature changes, swelling, muscle spasms, immobility, and bone loss. Illnesses, stress, and pain or injury all cause flares up. Often times if I'm getting a virus or illness, my nerves and joints flare up rst. My fear was that this vaccine would cause my immune system to attack itself, causing my nervous system to attack itself, or to flare up into a Guill\u00e9n Barres type syndrome. And that fear was validated when I met someone who had the same nerve condition as me and her specialist out East told her not to get this vaccine-it would cause her nervous system to attack itself and shut down, or go into hyperdrive and eventually kill her. 12080Why do I have these fears-let me explain my other vaccine reactions, and why I believe my vaccines from my youth have caused a lot of the health problems I have now. I have a lifetime exemption from the flu vaccine due to anaphylactic shock reactions. Although I had an anaphylactic shock response to the regular flu vaccine, I oered to try it without preservatives the next year and I reacted the same way. When I started working as a phlebotomist at Med Center 1 (now Sanford) I was given a titer for the HepB vaccine. Although I had received this vaccine as a teenager, I had not developed the antibodies. So they gave the series of three shots to me again and we waited. We did another titer-no antibodies. Again I was administered the vaccines. This time though, I developed what they would call complex regional migraines. My co-workers at the time found me confused and lost in the back of the lab. I did not know where or who I was and I was blind in the left eye. The left side of my face was drooping and my left arm was numb. I spent the weekend in the hospital being worked up for strokes, brain tumors, and whatever else they could think to test me for. I had to deal with these \"migraines\" on and o for two years. When they tested me again-I still hadn't developed the antibodies. At this time they felt it was enough, and that I probably never would develop the antibodies. Later I would nd out that 5-10% of the population does not develop antibodies to vaccines. I would also discover that the symptoms I had directly after the vaccine were considered serious adverse reactions and should have been reported. When I was six years old I received my vaccines to go to rst grade. I developed a fever and a migraine so severe, I can remember it 36 years later. My grandmother gave me a baby aspirin for the fever. Within hours my hands and ngers turned purplish-blue and became so swollen that I could not move them for three days. After the swelling went down, it took weeks before my hands felt normal again, and the pain from the start of the reaction to weeks after was so horric that I can still remember exactly how it felt today. Since then I have had a reactive type arthritis that causes fever and inflammation when I'm sick or when my body is ghting something. I was a typical tough little farm kid until I had those vaccines. After that \"growing pains\", a heightened sensitivity to pain, joint issues, and fevers were a regular part of my life. I have also felt the discrimination from co-workers, patients and visitors. Many will have no problem telling me that I'm killing them, that I'm the reason covid is still around. These patients and visitors do not know I'm unvaccinated and so it is forgivable and I ignore them, but a co-worker in another department next to where I work does know. And we used to be on the same page-she said numerous times that she agreed with me on the dangers and the mandates. That was until Friday, her supervisor came into my area, and blatantly told me I am not allowed to speak to her sta. I am not allowed to ask them for help with anything, and I will not speak to any of them about \"my politics\". This supervisor has had a problem with me since she found out I was against the mandates and against this vaccine. She is nice to my co-workers, both of whom have gotten their vaccines, she jokes and laughs with them. I only get nasty comments and dirty looks from her. I have also been told to get on board with this, because this is the way the world will be. I was full time until hours were cut and I was told to nd hours as a greeter/screener. As I fought to get full time hours, with no PTO(I was using it to replace the hours I was losing) I found out my co-workers-both vaccinated-are still getting full time and have 200+hours of PTO each. When the hospital stopped labor pool and bought a tablet to screen people, I was told to get my hours at my other job-while both my co-workers still have full time hours. (The cut in hours for productivity was supposed to be equal to every employee-8 hours each week). This is a complaint that I have fought with them for months now, and this week it will be time to go to HR to start a formal complaint of how I've been treated. And perhaps put in my notice. These mandates are dangerous, not only because of the unknown long term aects of this vaccine, but the short-term and immediate eects are disabling and horric. These mandates are dangerous, causing people to quit their jobs or have nervous breakdowns-fear of how they will make ends meet. These mandates are dangerous because they are taking away the right of the person to chose what is best for their body and health. These mandates are dangerous because they are a head game-a threat to get everyone to concede to vaccinations. That's what CHI did-they used their survey to get people to answer, they gave religious and medical exemptions-many were denied and got the vaccine because of fear, some of those people are very sick right now. They even developed a new committee to go over the religious exemptions because of the amount they were denying. After all of the-you were denied, we give you two weeks to get us more info, you are denied, two more weeks, denied, two more weeks-but now all of those that got denied can self-test. It is maddening-the back and forth was enough stress to make me physically sick-my health conditions have flared up, and on top of it I'm ghting an ulcer due to all the stress. My job started to become a hostile work environment when this pandemic started-the number of death threats, the incidents of verbal, physical, and emotional abuse that I have dealt with because of the rules of masking and visitation have been astronomical. But today, in my own opinion, my workplace-with the stang shortages, and with all the traumas and hostilities over the year-it's much worse than a hostile work place. It is not a hospital that receives all as Christ, instead it favors the vaccinated. And has made it apparent that those who fear the vaccine do not get to have a voice. And nally these mandates are dangerous because if the government can force an experimental, dangerous medicine into its constituents, what is stopping it from complete tyranny? It is not the job of the government to decide what should be decided between a doctor and a patient. Please consider this in your voting today. If vaccines can harm me this much, and the injuries I have seen-what could happen to you, to your loved one, to your child if the vaccine is forced upon them? I pray those that got the vaccine have no side eects, no adverse reactions, and I pray that they understand why I would not want to risk my health or my family's wellbeing for an experimental shot. My prayers are with you all, and I pray that our voices-the voices of your constituents would be heard. We do not want these mandates, and after all of the months that we spent taking care of the sick, all of the families that I escorted to the rooms of dying patients, all the people I comforted and gave love too, it was not for nothing, it was what I, what we were called to do, to step up and love and care for the sick. And for the last almost two years we all did it without an experimental vaccine, we did not kill anyone, we only accepted all as Christ-we did our job as healthcare workers, and we did it well. Often times on little sleep and without breaks, with fear in the back of our minds-for our own families and loved ones. But we still did it and are still willing too-if we are allowed too. In Christ, Shaundi Marie Meyer proud North Dakota and Patriot Mama1 Joint Technical Corrections Committee Senator Judy Lee and Representative Robin Weisz , chairpersons Nov. 9 , 2021 HB 1511 Lee and Weisz and members of the committee: My name is Steven Weiser. I am a long tenured emergency room physician and I serve as President for Altru Health Systems in Grand Forks. I also serve as board chair for the Health Policy Consortium, a healthcare advocacy group that includes Altru Health, Trinity Health in Minot and Sanford Health in Fargo and Bisma rck. Collectively we provide 80 percent of the acute healthcare services in North Dakota. On behalf of my HPC colleagues I would like to thank each of you for your support and your leader ship. As you know, providing high -quality healthcare in a rural sta te is uniquely challenging. But while other states struggle through hospital closures and shrinking access to care, North Dakota's hospitals are supported by sound policy decisions. We are at a crossroads where we again look to you to make an important po licy decision that will greatly impact how hospitals can - and cannot - keep our staff and our patients safe from preventable diseases. The mission of a hospital is to provide the greatest level of care to its patients. To do so, healthcare workers are req uired to comply with many safety and infection prevention control measures, including vaccinations. Because COVID -19 vaccines, a proven way to fight the spread of COVID -19, has been horribly politicized, you are being pressured to pass a law that prevents businesses ability to require it . Please resist the pressure to do that and please vote no on House Bill 1511. The consequences of passing vaccine -related legislation at this time, especially policies that impede our ability to keep employees and patients healthy , will unquestionably result in more hospital -acquired infections , longer hospital stays and more death. North Dakota hospitals have been struggling to keep up wit h an increased demand for acute care for over 18 months. There could not be a worse time to take away our most powerful tool to prevent the spread of COVID -19. 120992 Please know that as health care providers across the state have implemented vaccine ma ndates for their employees, it has been done with the utmost consideration for the health and safety of those employees and patients served. Mandating vaccines has been considered carefully along with individual rights. Exemptions for religious and medical reason s have been thoughtfully respected. To protect our staff and the patients we serve, we continue to use every available tool known to prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID -19 including wearing masks and visitor restrictions. Our physicians, nur ses, and other vital frontline health care workers are doing heroic work for our communities despite shortages in staff that predate the pandemic and have grown because of it . We are immensely proud of and grateful for their work and the sacrifices made da ily to care for others. Vaccination requirements for health care providers and staff are not new. Hospitals have long required vaccinations for measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox and influenza with remarkable impact on staff and patient safety. As is t he COVID -19 vaccine, these immunizations are well -researched, safe and provide extensive protection from the greater risk of illne ss. Removing a private business' ability to require a vaccine for employees would jeopardize the ability of our hospitals and clinics to safely treat those under our care. Further, creating legislation at a time when the pandemic is still spreading throughout our communities could negatively impact a future need or critical decision that ultimately protects our community from gr eater harm and loss. Our state's health care providers, while strained, are working tirelessly to provide critical care for our citizens. We respectfully ask that you protect healthcare providers' abilities and decisions to continue the fight against this pandemic and keep our communities safe and sound. Please vote no on this bill and others that limit an employer's right to do what is in the best interests of their employees and of those to whom they provide services . This bill would force healthcare p roviders to take a huge step backward in proven infection control practices, hamstringing providers at a time when every hospital in the state is stressed trying to keep up with demand for hospital and emergency care. Sincerely, Steven Weiser, M.D. Health Policy Consortium Board Chair Altru Health Systems President sweiser@altru.org 701-330-5916 November 9, 2021 Testimony offered in opposition to HB1511 Representative Weisz, Senator Lee, and members of the Technical Corrections Committee, I am Karen Ehrens, Bismarck I am a member of the Governing Board of the North Dakota Public Health Association. I am a registered dietitian with a certificate in the core courses of public health, and have been working in public health for more than 25 years. The North Dakota Public Health Association was founded in 1944, and is the only organization in the state that represents the public health workforce and public health professionals with 177 members from all around the state. Please do not vote in favor of Special Session HB1511. Following find some of many concerns that public health workers, responding to the COVID-19 pandemic since the beginning of the pandemic, have expressed. This bill would harm local jurisdictions ' and business owners' ability to make decisions in the interest of public health, their population or customers, and their staff. \u00b7 This bill infringes on local control and political subdivisions' a bility to make decisions and regulations that are appropriate for the conditions in their areas. \u00b7 This bill infringes on the rights of business owners. Just as business owners are afforded the right to not allow patronage from people without shoes or a shirt, so too should these businesses be allowed to refuse patronage from unvaccinated individuals if they so choose. This bill would have a tremendous impact on the ability of concert promoters or other large event planners to safely allow large gatherings. \u00b7 Public health organizations have a duty to protect workers. This bill harms public health organizations the ability to protect their employees. \u00b7 This legislation may have negative impact on health care organizations' ability to require vaccination for employees and protect its patients or the population they serve. \u00b7 This legislation may harm university system operations, particularly colleges that train those entering the health professions. COVID disease testing is not a reliable alternative to vaccination for North Dakota \u00b7 Testing is part of an overall approach to reducing the spread of disease. There does not exist in all parts of North Dakota the capacity to offer regular testing to individuals. \u00b7 Population serial testing (testing multiple people multiple times), which varies in price and availability, can be more expensive than vaccination. As with any screening, tests will not12135identify 100% of cases 100% of the time, so the testing only option leaves itself open to false negatives and false security. \u00b7 The cost and lack of availability of serial testing ma kes this requirement discriminatory . It only works wh ere people have the means and access to such testing. Many residents in rural and frontier areas DO NOT have the opportunity to obtain regular tests. COVID antibody testing is not a safe alternative to vaccination \u00b7 There is not evidence that testing for the presence of antibodies provides reliable proof of immunity to disease. There is not yet enough evidence or agreement that the presenc e of antibodies after 12 months of experiencing a COVID -19 infection signals that people are immune to or could not spread COVID -19. \u00b7 Commercial antibody tests are NOT authorized f or use in any clinical decision -making. The antibody tests available now cannot and should not be compared to serum testing that is available to clinicians to make recommendations about who is susceptible to disease s such as rubella or hepatitis b. This is like comparing the purchase of $1.00 pregnancy test from the drug store to a blood test provided at an OB/GYN office; the commercial tests are not reliable and are not yet ready to be used to make decisions. Please consider that this bill would have tremendous, negative impacts on the health of the North Dakotans you serve . Thank you for your time and the consideration of these comments. November 9, 2021 FMWF Chamber Opposition to HB 151 1 Chairman Weisz, Chairwoman Lee, and members of the Joint Technical Corrections Committee, For the record, my name is Katherine Grindberg and I serve as the Vice President of Public Policy for the Fargo Moorhead West Fargo (FMWF) Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber's mission is to be a catalyst for economic growth and prosperity for businesses, mem bers, and the greater community. Today, on behalf of our over 1,900 members, I offer testimony in opposition to House Bill 1511 as written. We realize there is an appetite to advance legislation related to COVID -19 vaccinations, among other topics, and str ongly urge that business flexibility is prioritized and federal compliance is recognized. A major concern with this bill is the lack of consistency with federal vaccine mandates. Section two details exemptions employers shall allow for in regards to vacci nation requirements. These exemptions are not consistent with federal regulation which puts businesses in an unfair situation of being non -compliant with either the state or federal law. This is especially true for federal contractors where periodic COVID -19 testing is not a federally accepted exemption. Business exemption language regarding a federal law, rule, or guidance is necessary for section two. Section two, subsection 2c outlines health, religious, philosophical, or moral exemptions. We oppose adding any exemptions beyond the medical and religious exemptions already required by federal law. This is an unnecessary duplication that adds to inconsistency, creating difficulties for businesses. Finally, w e believe that private business leaders can make the best decision for their individual businesses based upon their unique services, location, workforce, and needs. Section one, subsection two prohibits businesses from requiring customers to provide proof of vaccination or the presence of pathogens, antigens or antibodies in order to gain access or services from the business. This regulation is an overreach on private businesses and adds further barriers for commerce and tourism 12146 as it would affect events wh ere speakers or artists will not perform in venues without vaccine requirements. The Chamber opposes any legislation that doesn't respect business flexibility or creates inconsistency with federal compliance. Thus, I respectfully ask this committee to rec ommend a DO NOT PASS to House Bill 1511 as written. Thank you for your time and consideration, I will now stand for any questions from the committee. Respectfully, Katherine Grindberg Vice President of Public Policy FMWF Chamber of Commerce kgrindberg@fmwfchamber.com | 701.516.2114 Dear Legisla tive Committee: This vaccine mandate is government overreach...to force a vaccine on any individual is illegal. To force vaccines on individuals in private businesses with over 100 employees, hospitals, long term care facilities, nursing homes...etc...is illegal. Our legislatures missed the boat when they did no t stop the vaccine mandates on CHI and Sanford hospitals ...look where our healthcare is now. Le t's face it, our Sanford and CHI hospitals are struggling...they will not admit it of course, but not only are they understaffed, but so stressed out because of how this mandate has destroyed the best health care. I see where the Attorney General is finally moving forward with a lawsuit to stop the government overreach on private businesses...and it is goin g to get worse if we don't fight back. I like the statement \" The Biden administration's overreaching mandate will only add to vaccine skepticism and resistance and exacerba te labor challenges while intruding on state s' rights and personal freedoms. The courts should immediately block this OSHA emergency rule and protect the freedom of private employers to make decisions on vaccinations that are right for them and their businesses. \" Please help the people of ND and the United States of America. We need to get our country back. Thanks for your time. Roberta Nagel 7035 6th Ave SE Linton, submitting testimony for HB 1511. I was recently diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. It has been found that vaccinations (of any kind really, not just those for COVID-19) can either create a 'flare up' in those with autoimmune conditions OR can cause a person's already taxed body (from internal and external toxins from conventional, industrialized food, the environment, mental health issues, etc.) to develop one. I am not anti vaccine. Not in the least. I am, however, anti-making decisions based on false, fear based, corruptly funded 'advice' and 'science'. Since my diagnosis I have been doing as much research as I possibly can to help create the best version of myself as I possibly can. I am a mother to two young daughters. I have made the decision that these vaccines in particular (the ones related to COVID-19) are not what will be included in my (or my family's for that matter) health CHOICE. Choice. That is what is is. MY choice. Our choice. Health is NOT a one size ts all approach and should not be treated as such. To require that every single person be vaccinated against COVID-19 takes away a person's ability to CHOOSE what is best for their own health based on their individual story and should not have to require a physician's 'approval' for exemption. A person should have the choice to decide for themselves what is best for their bodies, what will help them thrive; whether they choose to be vaccinated or not. At the risk of developing a flare with my current autoimmune disease or possibly developing autoimmunity to another tissue in my body (which, people with autoimmunity are at RISK of developing an additional autoimmune disease every 10 years) AND risking not being my healthiest self for my daughters, husband, family and friends, I CHOOSE not to be vaccinated because it isn't right for me. The risks of worsening my autoimmune disease far outweigh the benets of receiving a vaccine for COVID-19 at this time. The risks of potential side eects and/or death associated with the current COVID-19 vaccines far outweigh the perceived safety net it (does not) provide. PLEASE. Do NOT force (or even allow) employers to enforce COVID-19 vaccines or require proof of vaccination (or antibodies for that matter) for employment. Taking away a person's right to choose whether or not to be vaccinated against COVID-19 is NOT the way to approach creating a healthier population. I cannot imagine being so ill for my daughters and husband that I cannot function enough to be their mother and wife. I cannot imagine not being there for them, period. COVID-19 and countless other illnesses can be and ARE very serious especially for vulnerable populations. However, INSTEAD of placing fear into the hearts of all, put time, energy, resources into education about how we can be the healthiest most positive versions of ourselves based on PROPER nutrition, exercise, mental health, community, etc. so our bodies are better able to handle viruses, toxins and countless other insults our bodies are exposed to.120482021 JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE MINUTES Technical Corrections Committee Pioneer Room, State Capitol HB 1511 11/11/2021 AM A BILL for an Act to create and enact a new section to chapter 34 03 of the North Dakota Century Code, relating to employer -required COVID -19 vaccinations; to amend and reenact section 23 1220 of the North Dakota Century Code, relating to limitations on requiring documentation of COVID -19 vaccinations, antibodies, and post -transmission recovery status; to repeal section 23 1220 of the North Dakota Century Code and section 2 of this Act, relating to limitations on requiring documentation of COVID -19 vaccinations, antibodies, and post -transmission recovery status and employer -required COVID -19 vaccinations; and to provide an effective date.
