Arctic Indigenous communities are unique, geographically remote and/or isolated, and currently among the most susceptible populations in the world to the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Since colonization, Indigenous communities have been particularly susceptible to infectious disease outbreaks. Methods. This study reviewed current knowledge regarding social determinants of health (SDH) and pandemics in Arctic Canada and highlighted the implications of the current COVID-19 pandemic on individuals, families, and communities in Arctic Canada. Studies published in English and French pertaining to SDH or pandemics in the Canadian Arctic were located using key search words in three databases (PubMed, Medline, and CINAHL) as well as reference tracking of relevant articles up to September 2021. Studies were categorized according to infectious disease (COVID-19, H1N1 in\u0000uenza, and tuberculosis) or SDH (healthcare access, food security, mental health, socioeconomic status, cultural continuity, housing, and community infrastructure). NVivo was used to theme and sub-theme \u0000ndings of selected studies. Results. One hundred studies were included in this scoping review. Two articles related to COVID-19, \u0000ve to in\u0000uenza, and \u0000ve to TB; 27 healthcare access, 19 to food security, 17 to mental health, nine to SES, seven to cultural continuity, six to housing, and three to community infrastructure. Documented lessons learned from previous pandemics in Arctic communities provides evidence to inform public health policies and culturally safe programs for the current COVID-19 pandemic where many SDH exist as challenges for Indigenous communities. The SDH included limited healthcare access, food insecurity, mental health challenges, low socioeconomic status, limited cultural considerations in healthcare, and suboptimal housing. These \u0000ndings are also relevant to Indigenous communities in other Arctic regions facing similar challenges due to the pandemic. Conclusions.: It is essential to understand how SDH underlie the health and wellbeing of Indigenous communities in the Arctic and to utilize this information to inform critical policy and practice decisions for COVID-19 prevention, management, and treatment. This review indicated that many SDH are unique to Canadian Arctic settings and pose speci\u0000c challenges for the prevention and management of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Background Social determinants of health (SDH) are strong predictors of how different population groups can mitigate the impact and prevent transmission of infectious diseases, including the current COVID-19 pandemic. Indigenous communities in the Arctic are particularly susceptible to the pandemic's effects given unique SDH challenges, including long lasting and ongoing trauma caused by colonization.(1, 2) Indigenous communities around the world have been affected disproportionately by COVID-19. In the United States, COVID-19 has killed one in 2,300 Indigenous people, compared to one in 3,600 non-Page 4/79Hispanic white people.(3) Studies attribute these disparities to structural and socioeconomic inequalities. (2, 4) The Arctic as a region overlaps eight nations: Denmark (Greenland), United States (Alaska), Sweden, Norway, Finland, Russia, Iceland, and Canada. Of approximately seven million inhabitants of the Arctic, Indigenous peoples make up almost 10%.(5) In Canada, Indigenous peoples contribute 5% of the total population and over 75% of the Arctic population.(5) Arctic Canada constitutes approximately 40% of Canada's landmass and has the second lowest population density (3.3 persons per km2) of all Arctic Nations after Iceland.(6) Although no clear de\u0000nition of the Canadian Arctic exists, it includes three northern territories: Nunavut, the Northwest Territories and the Yukon, and anthropologically, parts of Northern Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador, in addition to the political de\u0000nition.(6) In terms of climate, Canadian Arctic expands to Northern Ontario where Arctic tundra exists along with the other regions mentioned.(7, 8) Historic colonialism and assimilation practices in Canada include separating children from families and cultures through residential schools and the Sixties Scoop, and continue to negatively impact Indigenous communities, resulting in socially mediated health inequities, disparities, and adverse health experiences and outcomes.(9, 10) Average life expectancy is roughly 10 years lower for Inuit at 72.4 years compared to 82.9 years in the non-Indigenous population.(11) Intergenerational trauma in Indigenous communities has resulted in disadvantageous socioeconomic status (SES) and a higher burden of illness manifested by poor general health and increased risk of chronic and infectious diseases, many of which were historically foreign to Indigenous communities; mental health conditions, such as depression, substance abuse, and suicide; increased engagement in harmful activities; and increased mortality.(10, 12) The legacy of the residential school system continues to have negative effects on all aspects of health and well-being of Indigenous communities throughout the country, including in the Arctic.(13) For more than 100 years, Indigenous children were forcibly relocated to residential schools and were disconnected from family, community, language and culture, and experienced physical, sexual, and psychological abuse.(12) Many residential schools provided poor quality diets and unsanitary and overcrowded living conditions. (10, 12, 14) Residential schools ran from the 1870s until 1996 and the adverse effects continue through psychological mechanisms, intergenerational trauma, and biologically embedded mechanisms such as malnutrition.(10, 12, 14) When discussing how SDH, health outcomes, and infectious diseases are interwoven in the Canadian Arctic, a historical perspective is essential. Cross-continental travel from Europe to America began in the late 1400s and created networks of trading for food, knowledge, technology, and animals.(15) This introduced foreign disease pools that \u0000owed far across continental boundaries, and new settler diseases, previously non-existent in Indigenous communities, disproportionately affected First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis.(15) Historical accounts report that John Cabot's contact with Labrador Inuit in 1498, and subsequent contact with whalers, explorers, missionaries, and traders, led to numerous outbreaks of diseases such as smallpox, syphilis, in\u0000uenza, and measles.(16, 17) Inuit in the Canadian Arctic experienced substantial changes to environments and lifestyles as a result of European settlement in thePage 5/79region. The \"High Arctic Relocation'' involved the Canadian government relocating nomadic Inuit from Northern Quebec to the High Arctic to permanent government-built settlements in the 20th century. This resulted directly in an outbreak of measles during transportation among Inuit as well as dogs (quimmiit), which Inuit relied upon for Arctic survival.(18, 19) Many of the new settlements were poorly located and constructed, lacked proper sanitation, and were distant from food sources. Diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) were rampant, and people were transferred forcibly to southern hospitals for treatment, separating patients from families, language, culture, and communities - sometimes forever. Despite the trend of TB declining in the Arctic, today TB rates are still approximately 300 times higher among Inuit than non- Indigenous Canadians.(20) During the 1918-1919 in\u0000uenza pandemic, mortality was as high as 90% in some Indigenous communities in Labrador.(21) During the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic, Indigenous communities across Canada disproportionately faced an increased risk of severe manifestation of the infection,(22) such as overcrowded housing, limited healthcare access,(23) delays in time to hospitalization, and higher rates of comorbidities.(22) These factors persist today, highlighting an increased risk for signi\u0000cant infection and poor health outcomes during pandemics. In March 2020, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut declared a state of public health emergency due to COVID-19. Support services and measures to prevent COVID-19 were implemented by territorial and federal governments to minimize impact on residents of the territories. High prevalence of poverty, food insecurity, overcrowded housing,(24) and inadequate basic infrastructure, including access to water(25, 26) and healthcare services(27) in the Arctic could make it di\u0000cult for Indigenous communities to follow recommendations for prevention, which require access to safe water for frequent handwashing, space for physical distancing, and immediate access to healthcare when needed. Existing literature primarily focuses on describing the spread of COVID-19 in Arctic nations, which draws attention to current gaps in the literature that facilitate understanding the implications of SDH in the context of the Arctic, including how SDH, such as healthcare resources and SES, can impact the overall health of Indigenous communities.(1) The aim of this study was to review current knowledge of SDH (healthcare access, food security, mental health, SES (livelihoods, employment, income, and education), cultural continuity, housing, and community infrastructure) in the Canadian Arctic and discuss implications for the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that COVID-19 is a novel viral disease with scarce relevant literature, this review included literature regarding the risk, response, prevention, and management of respiratory infectious diseases such as H1N1 in\u0000uenza, TB, and COVID-19. Methods The methodological framework described by Levac, Colquhoun, and O'Brien(28) was used for this scoping review. Ethics approval was not required. Arctic Canada was de\u0000ned as the three northern territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut) and northern regions of Qu\u00e9bec, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Remote and isolated regions inPage 6/79northern parts of Ontario, close to the northern coastline, were also included in the de\u0000nition to broaden the search. In addition to the current COVID-19 pandemic, a preliminary search of literature identi\u0000ed eight infectious diseases that have previously substantially affected Arctic Canadian communities: TB, human immunode\u0000ciency virus (HIV), H1N1 in\u0000uenza, sexually transmitted infections (STI), diphtheria, smallpox, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, and hepatitis. Of these, STI, HIV, H. pylori, and viral hepatitis infections were excluded due to the different transmission mechanisms and varying approaches to management and prevention. Search strategies: After consulting seminal works related to SDH in Indigenous communities,(29, 30) the following search terms were selected: healthcare access (utilization, accessibility, and medical travel), food security (traditional/country food), mental health (depression, suicide, and substance/alcohol use), socioeconomic status (SES) (livelihoods, employment, income, and education), cultural continuity (language), housing, community infrastructure, environment (climate), isolation (remoteness), and discrimination (colonialism). Command and operator terms such as AND or OR, asterisks, and quotation marks were iteratively used with these MeSH terms. Three scienti\u0000c databases (Pubmed, Medline, and CINAHL), and AlterNative: An International Journal of Indigenous Peoples, (which included references not found in the other databases), were searched by the authors (DI, SLJ, and GO), and articles published up to September 2021 were retrieved. The search was limited to original studies published in English and French. References of other types of publications including reviews and commentaries were reviewed to identify additional articles. Study selection: Articles were deemed eligible if: 1) they investigated at least one of the prede\u0000ned areas of interest, 2) they pertained to Arctic Canada as de\u0000ned above, and 3) full text was available through the University of Alberta Library access. Two authors (GO and SJ) \u0000rst screened the title and abstract, reviewed the full text, and discussed the eligibility of studies by identifying and presenting to each other the study settings and study \u0000ndings related to the search terms. A third author (DI) veri\u0000ed the screening criteria. Multinational studies were included if \u0000ndings were presented by county and results related only to Canada were available. Following discussion, the search terms \"Environment\" and \"isolation\" were removed as they yielded too many search results with relevant \u0000ndings. Diphtheria and smallpox were removed as search terms for yielding zero or one article respectively. The term discrimination was removed as it was discussed in the context of other SDH and was impossible to differentiate separately. Following a full text review, articles that were deemed out of scope or not about the Canadian Arctic were excluded. Data extraction: The following information was extracted from the eligible papers: year of publication, study location, study population, methods, and the summary of \u0000ndings. Summarizing the results and quality appraisal: Included articles were categorized into one of the three infectious diseases (COVID-19, H1N1 in\u0000uenza, and TB) or the seven areas of SDH (healthcare access, food security, mental health, SES, housing, cultural continuity, and community infrastructure). Three authors (SD, DI, SJ) utilized NVivo 12 to analyze and code the \u0000ndings of eligible articles and veri\u0000edPage 7/79codes through discussion and re-checking. Subthemes emerged from the thematic analysis of the included studies. Relevant quotes were extracted from the studies for each subtheme. STROBE (31) for quantitative studies, SRQR (32) for qualitative studies and MMAT for mixed-method studies were used to appraise the quality of the studies. Results The database search yielded 3,068 results, and an additional 948 articles were identi\u0000ed by manually reviewing reference lists of secondary studies. After removing duplicates, 2,335 articles remained for screening. One hundred and \u0000fty-three articles received a full-text assessment for eligibility. Finally, 100 articles remained eligible and included (Fig. 1). The extracted data are summarized in Table 1 and relevant quotes are shown in Table 2. The included articles were categorized into one of the infectious diseases or one of the SDH. Two articles focused on COVID-19, \u0000ve on in\u0000uenza, and \u0000ve on TB. Twenty- seven articles pertained to healthcare access, 19 to food security, 17 to mental health, nine to SES, seven to cultural continuity, six to housing, and three to community infrastructure.Page 8/79Table 1 Characteristics and major \u0000ndings of selected articles First Author, Reference, Publication YearStudy Design - Location - Population - MethodsFindings Infectious Disease 1: COVID-19 Petrov AN, et al.,(33) 2021- Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia, and the USA - N/A - Analyses of regional data (February 2020- January 2021)- Northern Canada had the spread under control, with very few deaths. - Northern Canada was at a \"pre-pandemic\" state until later in 2020 and had had a smaller second wave in November and December 2020.

(44) \"... the nurses were faced with an exceptionally challenging patient population in terms of complex disease management and co-existing social and health issues. Community residents lived with everyday risk factors for poor health that would be considered unacceptable in mainstream communities, such as overcrowded housing conditions without running water. Nurses were expected to provide primary care in a setting that was de\u0000ned not only by health and social inequities but also by an overwhelming burden of illness and injury.\" (44) Subtheme 2: Limited Number of Providers CHN: Community nurse; ICS-TB: International Circumpolar Tuberculosis 1: COVID-19 \"Staff shortages were discussed as a concern in relation to the ability of health care staff to focus on chronic disease care over acute care. As one nurse explained: Right now there's nobody here to run the diabetes program, there's only 2 full-time nurses here right now, so things like immunizations, prenatal, you know acute stuff, gets done before chronic stuff.\" (45) Burnout \"The high visibility of CHNs in small communities can lead to staff feeling like they are constantly working, with no separation between personal life and work. Without support from other staff members and clearly de\u0000ned roles, nurses in remote areas can often feel as though they work 24 hours a day, with no respite. That amount of work for any profession is unadvisable and, in the case of northern medical providers, can lead to poor mental well-being and burnout.\" (43) \"One nurse described her initiation to the work as follows: \"When I came here, everything seemed to be stressing me out. It was the isolation, being in a different culture...but the work aspect of it had me so stressed out that it was affecting everything else.\" Contextual and practice issues such as these contributed to a high turnover rate among nursing staff at this site. A review of relevant documents revealed that over 70 nurses had been employed in the nursing station in the 2-year period immediately preceding data collection.\" (44) Turnover \"Understa\u0000ng, low retention and a high turnover rate of [primary healthcare service providers] is a chronic persistent problem throughout the [Northwest Territories].\" (46) \"Staff turnover for remote nursing is recognized as a serious challenge, with vacancy rates between 37 and 57% across the regions in Nunavut.\" (47) Subtheme 3: Limited Training \"Nursing stations are often staffed with \"people [who] have less and less skills because there are [no] formal settings to get skills for this type of setting.\" Participants explained that northern nurses used to graduate from specialized training programs, which prepared them for the demands of work in remote communities. Nursing shortages have forced the communities in [the Sioux Lookout Zone] to rely more on short term replacement nurses (from agencies) who do not necessarily receive such training.\" (45) \"Hiring practices do not always allow for overlap between the previous staff member and the incumbent, \"If a position number is \u0000lled they can't put another person into that position while that position number is \u0000lled so I have to wait until an experienced nurse has left this building to bring an inexperienced nurse in and that's not the way you learn this job\" (Interview 0301). Without overlap time to do on-the-job training, new employees may be left feeling overwhelmed and under-supported.\" (43) Subtheme 4: Patient-Provider Relationships CHN: Community International 1: COVID-19 \"Some respondents related instances when they felt that health service providers failed to listen or respond appropriately to patients' descriptions of symptoms, resulting in negative outcomes for patients.\" (50) \"According to patients and family members, the most satisfactory interactions with service providers were with individuals who have served for many years in the community and were therefore highly knowledgeable about the language, customs, families and community ways.\" (50) \"In the absence of relational engagement, the process of care was characterized by a sense of disengagement within nurse-patient encounters, which was one factor creating gaps in continuity of care.\" (44) Communications \"One participant described examples of Inuit forms of non-verbal communication that might not be properly interpreted by caregivers who lack awareness of local dialect or gestures.\" (50) \"As the vast majority of Nunavummiut speak Inuktitut as their \u0000rst language and few health care providers are \u0000uent, language challenges may also contribute to misunderstandings.\" (47) Theme 2: Healthcare Service Availability Subtheme 1: General \"The need for public health is highlighted by the rapid changes in lifestyles and the accompanying modern lifestyle-related diseases.\" (46) Subtheme 2: Cancer \"Participants expressed a desire to see a greater range of cancer screening and diagnostic services offered within the territory.\" (50) \"After controlling for demographic, socio-economic and geographic factors, we \u0000nd that Inuit women are signi\u0000cantly less likely to have had a Pap smear test in the previous three years compared to non- Aboriginal female residents of Canada's north (OR: 0.63; CI: 0.40-0.98). Interestingly, distance from a hospital is positively associated with the incidence of Pap smear testing even though distance from a hospital is negatively correlated with having a visit to a doctor. The implication is that in more remote areas, community health centers typically staffed by nurses are important providers of regular screening for cervical cancer.\" (56) Subtheme 3: Diabetes CHN: Community health nurse; ICS-TB: International Circumpolar Tuberculosis frequently lamented signi\u0000cant environmental constraints: community isolation, poverty and rapid social change away from a traditional to sedentary lifestyle were commonly referenced. The impact of these social determinants of health were often discussed in relation to the patients' ability to properly manage their diabetes or engage in their care: \"Where else do people not have running water, unpaved roads, no vegetables or they're three times the normal price?\" (Nurse). These issues are separate from the health system, but they do affect the likelihood that people will (or can) follow diabetes guidelines as recommended by health professionals.\" (45) \"All storytellers described diabetes as a relatively new phenomenon among Inuit.\" (51) \"There was a range of levels of independence among storytellers regarding their health care decisions. Two storytellers made some of their own choices about medication regimes and blood sugar monitoring while a third reported exclusive reliance on their health care team for direction. This suggests that there were varying levels of con\u0000dence and knowledge about diabetes.\" (51) Subtheme 4: Medical Travel Arrangements for family \"Medical travel imposed signi\u0000cant burdens on families and communities in the forms of childcare, missing paid work, time away from family, and the \u0000nancial costs of travel, only some of which was recouped through health insurance bene\u0000ts.\" (50) \"The single biggest challenge reported was making arrangements for children, pets and other household responsibilities while away\" (63) Communication \"Respondents noticed limited information provided before travel, and unclear process of determining itineraries.\" (63) Cost \"During the weeks away from home mothers spent a great deal of money on baby sitters and on telephone calls to their children to reassure themselves. There was the additional cost of airfare if the partner came out too and there was the cost of the partner's time off work or away from hunting to look after children.\" (65) Limited equipment \"In addition to decreasing length of stay, many other undesired side effects of intubation and invasive ventilation are avoided with noninvasive ventilation. These include risks of failed intubation in rural and remote settings with minimal back up and limited equipment, upper airway trauma, barotrauma and volutrauma on the lungs, exposure to sedative medications and paralytics, increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonias, and increased long-term rates of poor compliance and chronic lung disease.\" (66) Logistics \"Respondents described the impact of delays between obtaining approval and receiving care: 'By the time [the patient] found out that he had cancer, it had metastasised already. Medical information took forever to reach us.'\" (63) CHN: Community health nurse; ICS-TB: International Circumpolar 1: COVID-19 \"Jurisdiction and responsibility for care Reciprocal billing and aligning policies and procedures in the different health jurisdictions were described as recurrent obstacles. Medical travellers and non- clinical programme staff were unclear about what services were covered, and what to do when patients were turned away.\" (63) Remoteness or weather \"Because of the remote geographic location of most communities, weather can impact medevac decision-making.\" (43) Unfamiliar environment \"These feelings were aggravated by the di\u0000culties of living in a residence with strangers, an unfamiliarly hot environment (summer in the south) with no air conditioning and unfamiliar food.\" (65) \"Of respondents who reported di\u0000culties, 5.0% identi\u0000ed that travel to an unfamiliar city was the most challenging. The city's size and range of services was described as overwhelming, especially in comparison to Northern communities. The ability to navigate complicated logistics had an impact on access to care.\" (63) Communication between levels of care \"Limited communication between various levels of care and from decision makers could impact care. Respondents noted that healthcare providers in Edmonton are not always aware of the care that is available in the patients' home communities. Continuity of care is a challenge given that remote and isolated communities rely on visiting healthcare providers from Southern centres, and there is a high turnover among providers.\" (63) Patient-centred care during travel \"When parents in Community B discussed the events around their baby's birth their perception was that they were allowed to make few choices themselves. They felt the majority of decisions were made by health professionals without their input. Lack of choice was particularly evident for the place of delivery and its conduct.\" (65) \"The \u0000rst had problems when she was unable to get assistance with breast feeding, despite repeated requests for assistance, resulting in engorged breasts and cracked nipples on discharge. Before leaving the city she was unable to \u0000nd anyone to help her because she was unaware of whom to contact.\" (65) \"Respondents described the bene\u0000t of welcoming and safe healthcare environments that provide high- quality, trauma- informed and culturally appropriate care. Healthcare providers and staff that exhibited cultural competence were described as providing better support to patients.\" (63) Subtheme 5: Specialists through eConsult \"The estimated total societal savings resulting from eConsult in Nunavut were $180,552.73, or $1,100.93 per eConsult. Excluding the costs of added referrals from the cost analysis increased the estimated societal savings to $195,373.71 or $1,191.30 per \"Stakeholders identi\u0000ed the need to better understand the needs of Indigenous LGBTQ youth in the NWT who may not be accessing mainstream LGBTQ-speci\u0000c community groups or events to the same degree as non-Indigenous LGBTQ youth.\" (58) Stigma, shame, feeling judged \"In the meeting, LGBTQ youth discussed community norms that devalued same sex identities and stigma surrounding LGBTQ-speci\u0000c services.\" (58) Subtheme 7: Emergency Response \" Roughly 2/3 of volunteers reported not having received any \u0000rst aid training in the past \u0000ve years, with many members reporting anxiety around potentially dealing with medical conditions perceived as complex (e.g. anaphylaxis or cardiovascular compromise).\"(49) \"Volunteers also expressed the emotional toll of responding to [search and rescue] incidents in the context of small communities where everyone knows one another, contributing to burnout and high turnover rates.\"(49) Subtheme 8: Women's and Pre/postnatal Care \"They felt the majority of decisions were made by health professionals without their input. Lack of choice was particularly evident for the place of delivery and its conduct.\"(65) \"[The family doctor] didn't really provide me with information at the \u0000rst appointment...I wasn't sure what to ask for 'cause I didn't know anyone who had gone through it and I wasn't really wanting to kind of tell anyone what was happening.\" (68) Subtheme 7: Pharmacy \"In remote communities without retail pharmacies, weather delays and retail pharmacy dispensing times can delay pharmacy deliveries by anywhere from two to ten days. These delays in many cases would signi\u0000cantly impact patient care.\" (47) \"Even in situations when a prescriber is within the community, it has been noted that understa\u0000ng (a common issue in the north) and/or high patient loads can cause [community health nurses] to dispense medications from ward stock rather than seek out providers for prescription authorizations.\" (47) Theme 3: Policies CHN: Community health nurse; ICS-TB: International Circumpolar Surveillance Tuberculosis 1: COVID-19 \"The low perceived value on obesity prevention efforts may be linked to a more focused attention on other pressing social/health issues that were prioritized locally during the community-based needs assessment and priority setting exercises in the face of limited resources. Findings from the needs assessment (unpublished) indicated that while obesity was not identi\u0000ed as a priority, food insecurity, alcohol abuse, and tobacco smoking were ranked as top three priorities in many communities and are currently receiving considerable attention from NDH. The limited community level support may have combined with other factors including \u0000nancial limitations to trigger suboptimal efforts on obesity prevention.\" (60) \"Organization-level commitment to implementing obesity prevention policies and programs was generally low. Research evidence in the \u0000eld has suggested that a lack of organizational readiness for change may account for as many as half of all unsuccessful change initiatives in a variety of \u0000elds including healthcare.\" (60) \"In this category, providers most often highlighted the fragmentation of care. One doctor explained the management structure as follows: It used to be that everyone was an employee of Health Canada, but now the support staff are employees of the band, the nurses are employees of Health Canada, and I am an employee of McMaster [University]. So none of us answer to the same boss...You know, the accountability is in 3 different directions.\" (45) SDH 2: Food Security Theme 1: Food Security Rates Subtheme 1: Household Level \"Food insecurity in general and more severe food insecurity in particular were more prevalent among Inuit households completing the survey than non-Inuit households. Approximately 45% of Inuit households surveyed in both September and May were considered food insecure compared to only 5% of non-Inuit households in September and 4% in May.\" (71) Subtheme 2: Individual Level \"The prevalence of food insecurity and severe food insecurity was higher (P<0.001) among those not completing a secondary education and among those with an income <$20,000 CAD compared with those of greater education and income.\" (73) Community food program users \"More than two thirds of the [community food program user] participants (70%) had experienced times in the last year when there was not enough food at home and it was not possible to access more. Coping strategies at these times included: switching to less preferred and lower quality foods (70%), reducing portions for oneself (64%), reducing portions for others in the household (45%), selling things to access money for food (42%) and sending household members to eat elsewhere (28%).\" (79) Subtheme 3: Suggested strategies to improve food security CHN: Community health nurse; ICS-TB: International Circumpolar Surveillance Tuberculosis \"Community members expressed eagerness to \u0000nd alternatives to both traditional food species and market foods. Long-term food storage and gardening were both suggested as possible solutions to food security in Old Crow.\" (70) \"Many participants discussed the importance of increasing independence and self-su\u0000ciency so that they didn't have to rely on food transported from the south. They wanted to advocate for food security initiatives and put some of the responsibility for improving food security towards community leaders.\" (74) \"Managers, harvesters, and users alike suggested that \u0000nancially supporting and/or employing harvesters through the community freezer initiative would be an option available to help people get back to the land, while at the same time promoting wild food consumption and helping to maintain a \u0000ow of wild foods in their community.\" (74) Theme 2: Food Accessibility Subtheme 1: Purchase, Cost, and Affordability \"With the decline in the traditional food supply, the community is eager to consider alternatives. Market foods are available and already form a signi\u0000cant part of the local diet, but share problems with quality and cost with other northern communities. Participants expressed concerns with the nutritional quality of market foods, especially the poor quality of fresh fruit and vegetables. Food costs were another major concern, with this being blamed on Air North freight charges.\" (70) \"Cost associated with the purchase of fruits, vegetables and dairy products made them inaccessible.\" (79) \"Since the community is isolated and primarily accessible only by plane, the cost of purchasing marketed food is high. As a result of the length of time required for transport, variety is limited, the quality of fresh produce is poor, and perishable foods quickly deteriorate in quality.\" (83) Limited income \"Household income [was] perceived by many as insu\u0000cient to support living/hunting costs.\" (80) \"When asked about the main challenge to achieving a sense of food security at the household level, 35% of participants answered unemployment. Closely following unemployment was income support being too low or not having enough money (26%) and the need to support other members of the family or household crowding (14%). The high cost of food was the main di\u0000culty for 12% of respondents.\" (78) Subtheme 2: Social Network or Food Sharing \"When asked how they adapt when there wasn't enough food, the majority of participants mentioned food sharing. Food sharing with family was the most common, followed by food shared between community members and then food shared with friends. Food sharing with family included immediate family as well as relatives, even if the relatives lived in another community. Food sharing was seen as a normal part of daily life and occurred more often during hunting seasons when game meat was made available by hunters. Most of the participants described that the food shared was traditional game meats.\" (74) CHN: Community health nurse; ICS-TB: International Circumpolar 1: Theme 3: Food Availability Subtheme 1: Food Programs \"[Community food programs] were highly valued among users, with 82% reporting that they regularly help alleviate hunger, while the absence of other options for accessing food during times of need was widely noted.\" (78) \"For users, the [community] freezer temporarily connects them to their traditional, land-based lifestyle by making all that is bene\u0000cial to them from their traditional territory more accessible.\" (85) \"[Community] gardens were regarded by community members as a means to acquire produce at a cheaper price, especially potatoes, which are favoured but very expensive in Fort Albany.\" (86) \"The school snack/breakfast program emerged as a valued resource that currently supports healthy eating.

Although some people are coping by retrieving water independently or sharing between households - as is customary for Inuit - for some subsections of the population, water shortages are limiting their ability to follow public health standards and negatively impacting their overall well-being.\" (126) Subtheme 2: Availability \"That 15 of the 28 households reported being without domestic water at least once per 2-4 weeks.\" (126) \"Participants did in fat report that households with young children often require more water than they receive\" (126) \"Our research revealed, however, that many distributions system challenges still exist and that some households in the case study community are not receiving adequate quantities of municipally delivered water.\" (126) Subtheme 3: Dealing with low supply \"Participants identi\u0000ed three coping techniques used to deal with municipal water delivery delays\" 1)retrieving their own water, or ice, from local rivers and lakes, 2)relying on neighbours and extended family to share available water and 3)altering their daily activities based on water availability\" (126) \"Many participants conveyed their preference for independently retrieving water as per traditional practices, regardless of a delay situation, which alleviated their dependence on municipal services\" (126) \"Despite noting their frustration, some participants accepted that periodically not having water at your home was part of everyday life.\" (126) Subtheme 4: Impact of low supply CHN: Community health nurse; ICS-TB: International Circumpolar Surveillance Tuberculosis 1: COVID-19 \"Domestic water delays and shortages exceeded the notion of inconvenience for some participants, and began limiting their ability to adhere to hygiene related public health practices and routines.\" (126) \"As a result, their health and well-being may be negatively affected if they are not capable of supplementing their domestic water supply by other means. In particular, the consequences of shortages and interruptions are more severe for participants in overcrowded housing, families, with young children households dealing with existing communicable infections.\" (126) SDH 7: Community infrastructure Theme 1: Physical resources \"[In] the winter the sidewalks are not as maintained. In the summer you could sort of go anywhere, and everywhere quicker as compared to walking in deep snow, or snow banks to go around\" (130) Theme 2: Communication resources \"These types of information are usually relayed through the local FM radio, which used to be the main mode of public communication in Arctic communities ...\" (129) CHN: Community health nurse; ICS-TB: International Circumpolar Surveillance Tuberculosis test Infectious Diseases COVID-19: Two papers analyzed COVID-19 case and mortality data in Arctic countries and concentrated on spatiotemporal trends and regional differences.(1, 33) Between February 21, 2020, when the \u0000rst COVID-19 case was documented in the Arctic, and July 1, 2020, Arctic Canada only had isolated cases and no signi\u0000cant outbreaks. (1) (33) The authors attributed this to the remoteness, strong public health guidelines, strict quarantine requirements, and knowledge that existing SDH challenges, including limited healthcare, existing SES, and health concerns could make Indigenous communities in the Arctic highly vulnerable.(1) Arctic Canada endured the second wave in November and December 2020 with limited fatalities again due to strict public health measures and the fact that many Indigenous community members were on the land at this time (i.e., in minimally populated areas where hunting, \u0000shing, and foraging occur).(33) H1N1 In\u0000uenza: This category included \u0000ve papers that yielded \u0000ve major themes: hospital admission (1),(34) pandemic experience (2), (35, 36) community response (1),(37) public health response (3),(35- 37) and future pandemic plans or recommendations (4).(23, 35-37) One study examined infant hospitalization due to respiratory tract infection in Inuit regions during 2009 and found that H1N1 infection accounted for 12.1% of admissions.(34) Pandemic experience related to strategies and measures put in place to curb the spread of infection, including screening at healthcare facilities, closing down public/community centres, and postponing large gatherings.(36) Low rates ofPage 55/79adherence by community members and unsuccessful distribution of vaccines were noted as a hindrance to measures being effective.(36) Similarly, limited resources, especially personnel (i.e., nurses), were identi\u0000ed as a barrier to curbing the spread of infection during the H1N1 in\u0000uenza pandemic.(35, 36) Community response encompassed speci\u0000c plans implemented in phases by the communities. These phases and plans tended to be dynamic from initial implementation to the end of the pandemic.(37) Authors also noted the need for community- or region-speci\u0000c responses.(37) Future pandemic recommendations were focused on communication and adaptability at all levels, from community to governments,(23, 35-37) and made to ensure that information dissemination was effective, response plans clearly outlined level of accountability, and plans were responsive to communities' evolving needs throughout the course of the pandemic. Critical public health responses during the pandemic included surveillance, distribution of antiviral medications, and access to health services.(35) Effective communication between governments and health systems and clari\u0000cation regarding roles and responsibilities at each level were identi\u0000ed as areas for improvement.(35-37) Tuberculosis: Five papers pertained to TB.(38-42) Factors signi\u0000cantly associated with TB status were sociodemographic (age, education, and ethnicity).(38, 39) One study found a homeless shelter and a gambling house hosted super-spreading events in Nunavut and suggested the important roles socioeconomic factors play in the transmission of TB.(42) Nunavik, an Inuit region in Northern Quebec, had a TB incidence rate of 199.5/100,000.(40) In 2021, TB among Inuit (170/100,000) was 300 times more prevalent compared to non-Indigenous populations (0.5/100,000).(38) A 51-month cohort study in Iqaluit, Nunavut noted a latent TB infection rate of 19.1%; more than half (53.0%) of patients with latent TB was Inuit, while 28.6% was non-Inuit (ethnicity of the remaining 18.5% of patients was unknown).(39) Of Inuit offered prophylactic treatment, 75% initiated treatment, and of Inuit who initiated, 76% completed 100% of the doses prescribed.(39) One study implemented interventions for TB prevention among youth and utilized training videos, which seemed to be an impactful way of learning for Indigenous youth. However, the authors suggested future studies are needed to target speci\u0000c age groups while remaining sensitive to Indigenous cultures and traditions.(41) SDH Healthcare access: Twenty-seven papers were identi\u0000ed and featured three areas of discussion: service providers (13),(43-55) healthcare service availability (24),(43, 45-47, 49-52, 54-69) and healthcare policies (4).(43, 45, 55, 60) Strong patient-provider relationships were associated with positive health outcomes.(43, 50, 55) Developing strong relations was dependent upon healthcare providers' level of community engagement(44, 54) and ability to communicate clearly and respectfully, both verbally(50, 54) and through use of body language.(47) Acknowledging the role of SDH when providing care was important for healthcare providers to build relationships with patients, as one physician expressed, \"[Patients are] working on more basic issues than checking where their blood sugars are at\" (p. 556).(57) Nurses coming from Southern Canada were often unprepared for the cultural context and institutional procedures of thePage 56/79Arctic.(44) High demands of providers and sta\u0000ng shortages(45-48) created provider burnout, high turnover rates,(43-47, 49, 57) and barriers to effective training,(43, 45, 49, 62) which hindered culturally safe care(43) and impeded continuity of care.(57) Understa\u0000ng resulted in shifting focus towards acute care and away from managing chronic diseases, such as diabetes.(45) Service providers reported feeling overworked 24 hours a day without adequate support (43) and burnt out, particularly nurses from Southern Canada who experienced di\u0000culty adjusting to Arctic culture.(44) Physicians practicing in northern territories identi\u0000ed limited involvement in making healthcare policy, limited cultural safety, discontinuity of care, tasks outside scope of practice, high turnover, and limited support as contributors to physician burnout.(53) Building supportive relationships with colleagues and the community and spending time on the land and outdoors were reported to mitigate physician burnout.(53) Availability of and access to healthcare services were discussed in 13 articles(43, 45-47, 50-52, 55-61) pertaining to general access, services speci\u0000c to diseases such as cancer and diabetes, medical travel and virtual consultations, services embracing LGBTQ2S+, and abortion and pharmaceutical services. Indigenous community members were more likely to consult with community nurses than with physicians, due to the limited number of physicians in Indigenous communities.(56) In the current healthcare system, health centres in remote and isolated northern communities are staffed by nurses that provide primary health care and provide physician services by visiting physicians or medical travels of patients to a regional centre.(56) Inuit women had lower rates of cervical cancer screening and mammography compared to non-Indigenous women.(56) Remote communities had limited access to services,(54, 55) as some cancer screening programs were unavailable at the community level and required travel to access.(50) This often tended to delay diagnosis and treatment.(50, 57) people with diabetes advocated for more culturally appropriate and relevant forms of healthcare and for information available in Indigenous languages.(51) Medical travel is a key part of healthcare in the Arctic. A 2010 study reported that while 94% non- Indigenous adults across the Canadian Arctic lived within a linear distance of 50 km from a hospital, 50% of Inuit lived more than 400 km from a hospital, and were required to travel to access critical healthcare services.(56) About half of medical travel was undertaken by people from remote communities travelling to regional centres with a hospital, either within the territory of residence or in neighbouring provinces in Southern Canada.(56) Twenty percent of medical travelers went from regional centres to large urban centres in the provinces, and another 20% travelled from remote communities with only primary care to large urban centres such as Ottawa, Ontario and Edmonton, Alberta.(56) Time spent at each facility differed based on the treatment required: from an average of nine days in Edmonton, Alberta(63) to over a month in Ontario among Inuit cancer patients and escorts from Nunavut.(67) From 2011-2016, Northwest Territories and Nunavut averaged 23,012 and 21,578 annual medical trips, respectively, and 10% of medical travels were emergency medevacs, which accounted for 49% ($9.5 million) and 35% ($24.8 million) of the total medical travel costs of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, respectively.(64) Patients faced costs associated with paying for childcare and telephone calls while away from home. Patients' partners incurred air travel costs to support the partner, and lost wages associated with taking time off work or hunting to care for children.(50, 65) Medical travel had numerous challenges including:Page 57/79arrangements for family,(50, 63, 65, 67) communication,(63, 65, 67) limited equipment,(43, 66) logistics, (63, 67) impersonal policies,(63, 65, 67) remoteness and weather,(43, 67) and facing unfamiliar environments during care.(63, 65, 67) Patients felt overwhelmed by having to stay with strangers in shared residences, grow accustomed to the weather in Southern Canada, and eat unfamiliar food.(63, 67) One study (61) examined virtual consultations as a solution to overcoming barriers to accessing care without the need for medical travel. It was estimated that virtual consultations could result in a total saving of $180,553, or $1,101 per session.(61) The utilization of technology such as robots to provide remote physician presence in Arctic communities was suggested as a feasible and cost-effective option to improve healthcare access.(69) For LGBTQ2S+community members, limited availability of inclusive care was a barrier for accessing healthcare. Studies documented that individuals felt dominant norms devalued non-binary identities and LGBTQ2S+health information and services.(52, 58) Stigma surrounding non-binary relationships was a barrier for seeking out information regarding safe sex e\u0000cacy and discussing it with one's partner, particularly in small communities where residents know each other and achieving con\u0000dentiality may be di\u0000cult.(59) Emergency response systems referred to an ability to immediately respond to medical emergencies in the studies. Arctic conditions and limited or challenging roadways complicated the availability of these services.(62) Arctic search and rescue was found to rely heavily on volunteers, who were often undertrained and burnt out.(49) The high emotional toll on search and rescue volunteers was identi\u0000ed as a cause of high volunteer turnover.(49) One article focused on the lack of funding resources for local emergency response within communities.(46) Papers also examined the availability of and access to specialist services such as women's health services, including abortion (68), pre- and post-natal care,(65) and pharmaceutical services.(47) Women faced signi\u0000cant challenges when accessing abortion services due to complicated processes that lacked transparency, leading to \u0000nancial and emotional stresses.(68) The variety of birthing and postnatal services to accommodate women's preferences were also limited in the Arctic. Some women struggled with the limited options available and felt left out of decision making.(65) Pharmacies faced challenges with resources and medications were often delivered later than required in remote communities.(47) Di\u0000culties contacting patients to pick up prescriptions and limited understanding of medications affected patient adherence to treatment regimens.(47) Policies that may affect healthcare access in terms of obesity(60) and diabetes care(45) were explored with key informants. Participants identi\u0000ed systemic barriers to care experienced by parents, including fragmented and scattered healthcare delivery and responsibilities concerning diabetes care.(45) Obesity prevention was identi\u0000ed as the area of least priority by the healthcare system and also a barrier to providing adequate access to care.(60) Food security: A total of 19 articles were included: ten papers presented on the prevalence of food insecurity,(70-79) 11 on food accessibility,(70, 74-76, 78-84) and availability.(70, 74, 75,Page 58/7978-83, 85-88) Over 40% of individuals in an Inuit community had low or very low food security.(76) At the individual level, food insecurity was associated with: an annual income of less than $20,000 CAD, an at-risk adiposity level,(73) limited formal education, living with three or more family members, unemployment, and having few hunters or \u0000shers in the family.(77) The majority of community members utilizing community food programs (e.g. food bank) experienced not having enough food in the past year.(78, 79) Coping strategies included eating less preferred food, reducing amount of food consumed, and selling belongings for money to get food.(78, 79) At the household level, food insecurity was more common in Inuit households (45%) compared to non-Inuit households (4%).(71) Studies found a higher prevalence of severe food insecurity in Inuit households (27%) compared to First Nations households (17%), although overall food insecurity was more common in First Nations households (70% compared to 63%).(73, 75) Factors associated with household food insecurity were: the family member in charge of food preparation being 40 years of age or younger, unemployment,(71) suboptimal housing conditions, absence of an active hunter in the family,(73) and having children in the household.(72, 75) Food accessibility was subcategorized into purchase/cost/affordability and social network/food sharing. Although an individual's ability to achieve food security considerably varied by region,(82) high costs of food and limited food options were common challenges.(83) With traditional food supplies decreasing, market foods were considered as alternative food sources but were often unaffordable or of low quality and nutritional value.(70, 75, 79) Remoteness resulted in long transportation times, compromised food quality,(83) particularly of perishable foods such as fresh produce and dairy products,(70, 79) high food costs, and limited variety.(83) Market foods were two to three times more expensive in the North than in southern regions of Canada, despite government subsidy programs.(80) Traditional/country foods was reported to be affordable and easily accessible by Dene/M\u00e9tis women, while Inuit women found otherwise.(81) Di\u0000culty accessing both market and traditional/country foods was further aggravated among low-income individuals or families.(78, 80, 82) School snack/breakfast programs were reported to increase students' access to healthy food although could be improved by increasing the variety of food. (83) Food sharing with networks of family or community members was identi\u0000ed as a means to secure traditional/country foods.(74) Having extended family members, elderly or hunter household members, and someone to supply traditional/country food in the family network was an advantage for accessing traditional/country foods.(76, 78, 79, 84) Households headed by a single young woman were marginalized in such networks,(76, 84) although households headed by a single elderly woman were not, as the children were often old enough to hunt and provide traditional/country foods for household consumption.(84) Individuals or households with the ability to provide compensation or hunting supplies for food were more likely to receive traditional/country foods from others.(70, 76, 80) Studies identi\u0000ed limited market food availability in remote communities. Traditional/country foods were less available in larger communities.(80) Complex reasons for the limited availability ofPage 59/79traditional/country foods were categorized into the ability to hunt (74, 78-80, 82, 85, 86) and environmental factors.(70, 74, 81, 85, 87, 88) Hunting had become di\u0000cult for several reasons and affected traditional/country food availability. First, knowledge related to harvesting and preparing traditional/country food was being lost in Arctic communities, particularly in younger generations.(80) Increased formalized employment restricted individuals from hunting due to limited time available.(80) Costs of hunting supplies such as guns and gas were perceived to be high.(74, 79, 80, 85, 86) Hunting was not always successful, making hunting less economically e\u0000cient and less enjoyable.(74) Available supports, such as funding for hunting equipment, were less than what was needed.(80) Climate changes and the impact on traditional food availability (e.g. increased rainfall, less extreme winter) were commonly observed across Arctic communities. (85, 87, 88) These changes provided access to lands that were historically inaccessible, and increased hunting grounds and vegetation growth, which fattened caribou,(87) but also resulted in unstable and unsafe hunting conditions, and changes in health, abundancy, behaviours, and migration patterns of animals.(70, 74, 81, 85, 87, 88) Contamination was also perceived to affect animal health and the taste and texture of harvested food.(74, 87) Mental health: Seventeen articles focused on mental health, and four major factors of mental health were identi\u0000ed: alcohol and substance use (4),(89-93) family and support networks (5),(94-98) gender (7), (91, 97, 99-103) and seasonality (3).(97, 104, 105). A history of substance use and having a parent with an alcohol or drug addiction were reported as factors related to suicide attempts.(89) Alcohol use was reported among 60% of pregnant Inuit respondents in Northern Quebec.(90) Binge drinking was identi\u0000ed as a major public health concern in some communities in Nunavut and Northern Quebec.(91, 92) Research on family and support networks produced mixed \u0000ndings. Some studies found families and friends played a key role in contributing positively to mental health,(94, 95) and support networks helped community members feel engaged with and connected to community.(95, 98) Others found family and support networks could adversely affect mental health; of Inuit receiving psychiatric consultation, 35% reported family con\u0000ict/stress, 26% marital and relationship stress, and 26% family member abuse.(97) High levels of suicide within groups could create a 'social logic' to suicide, which could be internalized by the community and repeated by others.(96) Physicians were reported to be the major source for psychiatric consultations,(97) although about two thirds of psychiatric care clients in Iqaluit reported having no previous professional psychiatric support,(97) which is in line with the aforementioned limited number of general physicians. Gender was described as a male-female dichotomy and reporting on LGBTQ2S+persons was scarce.(91, 97, 99-102) Although rates varied based on community and time, suicidality was more common among men.(100, 101) Male Inuit youth were 17% more likely than female youth to have previously attempted suicide.(100) Women (n=1,674) were more likely than men (n=1,184) to call a crisis line.(102) A studyPage 60/79among adolescents found the odds of having a severe type of depression were twice among female cisgender, compared to LGBQ2S+and food insecure adolescents.(103) Studies found seasonal variations in mental health. Winter months (October-March) accounted for around three quarters of the total psychiatric consultation referrals for Inuit clients.(97) Seasonal mood changes including seasonal affective disorder appeared to be more frequent among Inuit in the Canadian Arctic compared to other settings.(104) In the context of climate change, warmer temperatures affected quantity and quality of snow and sea ice in the winter, preventing Inuit from spending time on the land, potentially contributing to increasing mental health-related visits to clinics.(105) Socioeconomic status (SES): Nine studies pertained to SES.(106-114) Income, employment,(106-112) and education,(106, 108, 109, 113, 114) were coded under SES. Studies showed that these SES indicators were associated with health behaviours,(106, 109, 112) such as eating patterns and safe sex practices, (106, 109, 112) and health outcomes, such as chronic conditions, (107, 108, 111, 113, 114) in Arctic communities. Individuals with low SES were disproportionately faced with challenges related to other SDH such as food and housing security.(110, 114) Cultural continuity: Seven studies were categorized into six cultural aspects: one into holism(115) four each into relationship,(115-118) sense of community,(115, 117-119) and cultural responsiveness and knowledge,(115, 116, 118, 120) three each into nourishment,(115, 117, 118) language.(117, 120, 121) Holism has been described as viewing a person in relation to land, traditions, home, values, roles and responsibilities in the world and as recognizing the interconnections between the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of a person's health.(115) Relationship refers to connections between individuals and communities and related aspects such as respect (115, 118) and communication.(116) Relationships with family and kinship were found to be closely associated with one's well-being, health, and healing.(116) Changes in childbearing and parenting practices and segregation of generations often appeared to result in cultural discontinuity and confusion in one's cultural identity.(116) Relationships with other community members through community events were related to good health.(117) Although modern technologies, such as telephone and radio, introduced different ways of communicating, face-to-face communication was preferred, and linked to positive emotions, well-being, and healing.(116) Community members share histories, cultures, perceptions of health, experiences with healthcare, interactions with the healthcare system, and insights regarding community health needs.(115) Members of northern remote communities highlighted a need for northern-based resources that re\u0000ect local cultures, experiences, and stories in risk management messaging.(119) In Inuit self-governed regions, satisfaction with local Inuit governments was associated signi\u0000cantly with better self-rated health.(117) Cultural responsiveness and knowledge have been identi\u0000ed as important to health,(116, 118) yet these factors are at times overlooked by non-Inuit care providers.(120) Inuit nurses and nursing students couldPage 61/79help alleviate cultural tensions in the healthcare system through \"double culturedness\" that enables Inuit nurses and nursing students to learn, teach, communicate, and interact in both Inuit and Western ways. (120) The exchange of knowledge between healthcare providers and communities \"that incorporates a holistic view of the interconnectedness of traditional spiritual and environmental laws and an understanding of the natural order.\" (p. 10) was suggested to promote cultural sensitivity in the healthcare system.(115) Achieving nourishment through traditional foods and water, respecting the sources, and sharing with others are important aspects of the cultures of Arctic Indigenous communities.(115) Harvesting, consuming, and feeling satis\u0000ed with traditional foods were positively associated with reporting good health.(117) Spiritual and emotional nourishment through sewing was found to promote health among Inuit women.(118) Having access to services available in a local Indigenous languages in Arctic communities has been reported to be positively associated with self-rated health.(117) In one study, Inuit nursing students recognized a disconnection between healthcare education and Inuit language and felt the students needed an interpreter to properly care for Inuit patients because the students had not learned medical vocabulary in Inuktitut.(120) Healthcare professionals practicing end of life care in the Arctic were also reported to rely heavily on interpreters when discussing care options with patients and families and providing cultural and emotional support.(121) Despite the necessity of and high demand for interpreters, low job retention and absenteeism were common among interpreters due to emotional stress, limited formal training and resources, lack of recognition of interpreters' tasks, and ethical and cultural dilemmas.(121) Housing: In seven studies that examined housing as the living environment of community members, three main themes were apparent: one study investigated air quality,(122) three overcrowding,(123-125) and three water.(125-127) Thirteen percent of houses surveyed had low ventilation, increased CO2 levels, and poor air quality, which were associated with illness such as respiratory tract infections.(122) The poor air quality was in part due to overcrowding.(122) Studies found a high prevalence of overcrowding led to negative consequences, such as food insecurity, increased \u0000res, and increased health centre visits.(123- 125) Studies showed many distribution challenges and delays with water supply for households.(125- 127) One study reported over half of the households in one community in Nunavut were without water at least once every two to four weeks.(126) Community members coped with delays by personally retrieving water, sharing water amongst families and neighbours, and changing activities based on water availability.(125, 126) Community infrastructure: Three papers explored broader infrastructure within remote communities. (128-130) Infrastructure was discussed as both physical (e.g. steep stairways to homes and buildings, lack of ramps) and communication resources.(129, 130) Elders in one community relied on an FM community radio station for news about the community and services; however, the radio station had beenPage 62/79down for several months.(129) Physical community infrastructure such as roads and lighting could affect walkability and help reduce body mass index (BMI).(128) Discussion This scoping review summarized the current scienti\u0000c literature about selected pandemics (COVID-19, H1N1 in\u0000uenza and TB) and SDH (healthcare, food security, mental health, SES, cultural continuity, housing, and community infrastructure) in Indigenous communities in the Canadian Arctic. Herein, the relevance of previous pandemics and associations with SDH identi\u0000ed above to the current COVID-19 pandemic in the Canadian Arctic are discussed. Infectious disease and Indigenous communities in the Arctic Infectious diseases have persisted as factors affecting Indigenous health. In Greenland and Canada, Inuit ethnicity correlated with higher rates of TB in comparison to people of other ethnicities.(20, 131) In the United States, American Indians and Alaska Natives were 13 times more likely to die from TB in comparison to White Americans.(132) During the 1918-1919 in\u0000uenza pandemic, in both Alaska and Labrador, mortality was substantially higher than the worldwide average.(21) Through the course of the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic, Indigenous communities in the Canadian Arctic (23) and Alaska (133, 134) experienced higher prevalence and impacts than non-Indigenous communities. COVID-19 is a respiratory disease like TB and similar implications have been documented among Indigenous communities.(2, 135-138) Recent restrictions and proscriptions in place to prevent COVID-19 may present greater challenges in Indigenous communities than non-Indigenous populations in the Arctic due to existing socioeconomic, geographical, transportation, food security, water security, and housing barriers combined with a culture of holism and interconnectedness that includes traditional gatherings.(139) Targeted, evidence-based, community informed and led responses are urgently needed. SDH COVID-19 and the social, economic, and health impacts of the related restrictions could exacerbate the already existing SDH, increasing vulnerability to COVID-19 and other health implications in many Arctic communities. Medical travel has become increasingly complex during the pandemic. Restrictions and suspension of non-urgent care may reduce the spread of COVID-19, although at the same time have long- term negative implications, such as reduced cancer survival due to delayed diagnoses,(140) and permanent vision impairment or blindness due to postponed eye care.(141) Delaying non-urgent health services has been outlined by the Northwest Territories and Nunavut in pandemic response plans.(142, 143) The territories seek to maintain medical travel(143) and urgent medical travel has continued, although accessing healthcare services remains a concern with the surge in active COVID-19 cases in Alberta, a destination for northern residents embarking on medical travel.(142, 144) Future research isPage 63/79needed to explore the impact of COVID-19 on medical travel and the short-, medium-, and long-term effects of delayed access to care. The H1N1 in\u0000uenza pandemic highlighted an increased need for psychological support for healthcare providers.(145) COVID-19 likewise has evoked fear, uncertainty, frustration, anger, helplessness, and sadness among nurses in Southern Canada.(146) Healthcare providers in the Arctic already reported high levels of stress and burnout prior to the COVID-19 pandemic - a fact that has serious implications for access to quality care for Arctic communities, yet. inquiries into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Arctic healthcare providers is largely non-existent. As the pandemic continues, it will be critically important to support healthcare providers' mental health, thereby enhancing the ability to provide quality care while protecting against burnout. Supports could also include education related to culture and traditions of the Indigenous communities, promoting integration, and meaningful connection to the communities within which the providers are employed. The adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on mental health has also become a pressing concern in the general population. Anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia, compulsive behaviours, phobias, and life dissatisfaction have all been reported in general public and healthcare providers.(147) The rate of suicide among Inuit(148) and prevalence of alcohol use(91) were high, which are generally understood to be rooted in a history of colonization and continued colonialism, forced assimilation, and resulting intergenerational trauma.(149, 150) Some studies in this review identi\u0000ed the impact of seasonality on mental health in Canadian Arctic communities. Recent studies observed seasonal variation in transmission of COVID-19 as outbreaks are more common in winter months particularly at higher latitudes.(151, 152) Special attention to mental health and seasonal variation of COVID-19 transmission among Indigenous community members in the Arctic is imperative. The scarcity of resources in the midst of the pandemic may be a speci\u0000c cause of uncertainty and fears. Social distancing advisories during the present pandemic may have the potential to complicate access to support networks, connecting with families and Elders, and cultural practices, and affect mental health within Indigenous communities in the Arctic. It was suggested to Indigenous community members to go on the land and engage in traditional activities to cope with the pandemic.(153, 154) Studying stressors and resilience strategies will be important for understanding how COVID-19 is shaping the landscape of mental health in the Arctic. Historically, colonial and assimilation practices continue to contribute to ongoing health inequity and adverse health experiences and outcomes for Indigenous peoples.(9, 155) Today, many Indigenous community members subsequently \u0000nd there is limited acknowledgement of language, lands, traditional foods, traditional knowledge, holistic views of health, and self-determination when accessing healthcare. (156-159) COVID-19 mitigation measures may have further adversely affected the practices of Indigenous cultures, such as gathering and visiting, which are critical for strengthening relationships with family and community and holistic traditional nourishment through the sharing of foods. Ceremony and generational connections are critical elements of Indigenous cultural wellbeing in the Arctic.(115) The importance of culturally safe care to improve general health and promote healthcare utilization for managing chronic conditions has been highlighted.(63, 117, 160-163) In the presence of a contagiousPage 64/79disease such as COVID-19 that has exempted no one, culturally appropriate care becomes even more important for the effectiveness of public health measures and rapid acceptance by the communities. Listening to and understanding Arctic Indigenous community members' experiences with and perceptions of public health messages and overall health system responses during the pandemic should inform the development of culturally safe, appropriate, and relevant public health measures and community level messaging in the current and future pandemics. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected food production, distribution, and transportation, and exacerbated food insecurity worldwide.(164-167) Studies in the Arctic identi\u0000ed a young age of the main provider, low income, and low educational attainment as factors positively associated with food insecurity during the pandemic.(165, 166, 168) In Canada, the prevalence of food insecurity has historically been higher in the northern territories (49.4% in Nunavut, 15.9% in the Northwest Territories, and 12.6% in Yukon compared with the national rate of only 8.8% in 2017/18).(169) During the current pandemic, 14.6% of Canadian households in southern provinces experienced food insecurity,(168) but the prevalence in northern communities is unknown. Moderate or severe food insecurity may have signi\u0000cant biological implications including malnutrition, suboptimal immunity, and increased susceptibility to infections. Inuit traditionally had diets rich in vitamins A and D, (170, 171) and have recently undergone a dietary transition that has resulted in reduced consumption of traditional/country foods and intake of nutrients important for immunity. (170-174) Food insecurity may also hinder individuals from adhering to public health guidelines when working or accessing community food programs.(175) Housing and infrastructure play an important role in containing and managing infectious disease outbreaks at individual, household/family, and community levels. Studies showed that overcrowding and poor quality housing had negative implications on health in general,(176, 177) and could increase vulnerability to the spread and impact of infectious diseases.(138) Infrastructure needs to account for the uniqueness of location and be tailored to balance the demands of geographical location with the needs of residents. The physical distancing measures stress the importance of access to uncrowded spaces, and the implication of overcrowded housing on COVID-19 experiences in remote Arctic communities should be further studied. Other aspects of living environment and infrastructure, such as roads, public lighting, and even phone and internet access could affect access to information and services during the pandemic and merit investigation. Though we believe this review sets the stage for future action as well as research into infectious disease and SDH in Arctic Indigenous contexts, there are several limitations. First, the literature search was limited to the selected databases through the University of Alberta, the selected search terms, and studies published in English, and may not have identi\u0000ed all existing literature. However, we consulted two publications regarding SDH and carefully deliberated the search terms. English and French are the two Canadian o\u0000cial languages, and the authors believe that searching for articles published in a language other than English or French would not have yielded different search results. Second, a few SDH that mayPage 65/79have implications for COVID-19 were excluded from this review. For instance, the SDH of the environment and isolation are unique in the Arctic setting. However, these SDH were presented in relation to other SDH and the authors believe this review provides context to these excluded SDH in some extent. The SDH of discrimination was also omitted. Ongoing systematic racism is rooted in the history of colonialism and shapes many aspects of other SDH among Indigenous peoples in Canada, which explain why the author's found discrimination was interwove with other SDH in literature. A review on the impact of discrimination on prevention and management of infectious diseases among Indigenous peoples in Canada is necessary to address this gap. Last, this review focused on the Canadian Arctic. Prior to the pandemic, the common concern Arctic Indigenous communities worldwide experienced was much more adverse health outcomes than non-Indigenous populations.(178) However, Arctic nations are heterogeneous and have unique health settings and differing impacts of SDH. Indigenous communities in Greenland show higher rates of binge drinking, smoking, overweight/obesity, and suicide mortality and a shorter life expectancy.(178) In Arctic Russia, Indigenous communities have lower social and ethnic health indicators and score lower in the dental health index.(178) Sami in Northern Scandinavia had similar health indicators compared with non-Indigenous people, except for Sami reindeer herders in Sweden and Sami-speaking patients in Norway that showed lower con\u0000dence in and satisfaction with primary healthcare services.(178) Alaska Natives in the United States and Inuit in Northern Canada have lower socioeconomic status, shorter life expectancy at birth, higher rates of smoking, overweight/obesity, and TB, and higher suicide mortality rates compared to the general populations.(178) This is likely to have gotten much worse due to the pandemic. Given the global impact of COVID-19, further review and discussion concerning the implications of SDH on the COVID-19 pandemic in other Arctic countries is needed. While the rest of Canada experienced the \u0000rst few waves of COVID-19 transmission in 2020, northern territories saw signi\u0000cant spikes starting 2021; currently the rate of total cases is the highest in the Northwest Territories (10,905/100,000 population compared to the national rate of 7,706/100,000, as of January 21, 2022).(179) Since declaring a state of public health emergency, restrictions and special requirements for travel and gathering may have greatly impacted residents in the Arctic, particularly Indigenous residents whose culture embraces sharing and gathering. Experiences with containing the spread of the virus may be substantially different and more challenging in the Arctic given SDH are affecting the communities disproportionately. Conclusions COVID-19 continues to affect the lives of many people and healthcare systems worldwide. Previous pandemic events have informed strategies to mitigate the impact of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic; however, SDH still present many unique challenges to the health and management of COVID- 19 in Indigenous communities in Arctic Canada. COVID-19 brings a double-edged sword to Indigenous communities in Arctic Canada; one end presents challenges related to preventing the spread of COVID-19 with the already-existing SDH, and the other end presents the impacts of restrictions against COVID-19 aggravating SDH. There is an urgent and necessary need to understand the experiences andPage 66/79consequences of COVID-19 in Arctic Indigenous communities and document response strategies that have been successful or need improvement to inform current and future pandemic response policies and programs.
