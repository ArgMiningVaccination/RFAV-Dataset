This annual report highlights the exceptional work that UC Davis staff has accomplished and the successful initiatives that transform the quality of pharmaceutical care for our patients. These exceptional accomplishments are detailed in the report under the respective service areas and program categories. This year has been very challenging for our staff and our patients. I am always inspired by how our staff continue to rise to the occasion to ensure our patients are at the center of our business while they themselves have been faced with challenges at home and in their communities. As we settle into what is likely the new normal, we set our sights on strategies that help us grow as a health system while maintaining clinical and operational excellence. I encourage you to take some time to reach through the FY22 annual report and celebrate the accomplishments of our department and your peers. We will continue to be challenged this year to deliver on the values of UC Davis Health, but together we shall succeed. I would like to thank each and every member of the staff for their commitment to the profession and dedication to the care of UC Davis patients.
