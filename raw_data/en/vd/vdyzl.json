Known as the \"grandparent\" of modern medicine and the sister philosophy of yoga, Ayurveda lets patients take control of their own health by focusing on prevention, not medical intervention. Practitioners become active participants in their own wellness by managing stress, consuming healing foods, and understanding which remedies work for their particular body/mind types. A Little Bit of Ayurveda explores the history, philosophy, and practical application of this ancient and relevant system: it looks at Ayurveda's influence on both Eastern and Western medicines; outlines the \"five element theory\" and the doshas; reveals how disease manifests itself; and offers simple rituals to keep you balanced, from seasonal eating and deep belly breathing to dry brushing and tongue scraping. A quiz at the end helps you complete an Ayurvedic self-evaluation . . . and starts you on the path to wellness. About the Author At the age of 16, chronic illness and obesity led Deacon Carpenter to a local Ayurvedic doctor, which created a seismic shift in his perception of nutrition, health, and physical balance. Heeding the advice of his doctor, Deacon modified his diet, started to practice yoga, and shed over 140 pounds, which led him to pursue Ayurvedic studies at Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa. In 2009, after a successful 16-year career in global advertising and branding, Deacon obtained his certification as a Clinical Ayurvedic Specialist, eventually moving to Sonoma, California, and establishing his practice in 2010. He continues to teach his practical approach to Ayurveda & yoga at Maharishi University of Management, where he has been a guest faculty member, adjunct professor, and co-creator of MUM's MS in Maharishi Ayurveda & integrative medicine. Deacon is the owner of YogaONE studio and the Director of Well Sonoma, an integrative medical clinic focusing on personalized medicine based in Santa Rosa, CA. "}
