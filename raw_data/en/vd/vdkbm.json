In simple words, ascites is a bodily disorder caused due to the build-up of fluid in the abdominal cavity. This fluid can also travel to the chest cavity and cause shortness of breath. by putting pressure on the diaphragm, which then presses on the lungs ( [1](http://umm.edu/health/medical/ency/articles/ascites), [2](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=134&contentid=79)). What Are The Types Of Ascites? Liver cirrhosis is responsible for 85% of ascites. The table below lists the other types of ascites and what organ they are associated with ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4521252/)). Type Of Ascites Associated Vena Cava Cardiogenic Heart Nephrogenic Kidneys Malignant Most organs of the body (with cancer) Pancreatic Pancreas Some of the uncommon types of ascites are: - Refractory ascites - These are ascites that recur after treatment. The patient is prone to developing various hepatic complications in such cases ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2886420/)). - Chylous ascites - This is an uncommon type of ascites. It is caused by leakage of lymph from a ruptured lymph vessel ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11189982)). A [report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470482/) published in StatPearls found that people with cirrhotic ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen due to liver cirrhosis) have a 50% mortality rate in 3 years. It was further estimated that people with refractory ascites (ascites after treatment) had a survival rate of less than 50% in 1 year. What Causes Ascites? Ascites most commonly occurs due to structural damage of the liver, leading to improper function. A liver disease like cirrhosis is primarily accountable for ascites. Apart from this, cancers that affect different organs like the colon, stomach, liver, breast , and pancreas are another major cause that can lead to ascites. Other [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526080/)): - intake, causing alcoholic liver disease leading to cirrhosis. - Excessive intake of sucrose and fructose, leading to nonalcoholic liver disease leading to cirrhosis. - Anorexia - Portal hypertension - Hepatitis - Hypoalbuminemia - Clots in the veins of the liver and heart - Pancreatitisi [X]A disorder caused by pancreatic inflammation that occurs when the pancreas begins to digest itself due to digestive enzymes. - Kidney (nephrotic) issues ( [1](http://umm.edu/health/medical/ency/articles/ascites), [2](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=134&contentid=79)) Note: There is an epidemic of nonalcoholic liver disease in younger people from the overconsumption of sucrose (table sugar) and fructose (from high fructose corn syrup sweeteners in soda).

Diagnosis Of Ascites After a basic physical exam and investigation of your symptoms, ascites is diagnosed mainly by two methods. - Fluid sample - With a needle and syringe, a sample is taken from the abdomen, this fluid is tested for infection and cancer. - Imaging - MRI, CT scan, and ultrasound are done to get a better picture of what exactly is happening inside the body and causing the ascites. Other tests that may be done are: - Urine analysis - Ascitic fluid analysis - Kidney function tests - Liver function tests - Varied blood tests depending on other symptoms - Electrolyte levels ( [1](http://umm.edu/health/medical/ency/articles/ascites), [2](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=134&contentid=79)) In addition, peritoneal dialysis treatment method is used for patients with end-stage renal diseases or renal failures to remove renal fluids.

However, it activates the body's core excellently and helps to relieve the pressure in the abdomen. - Mayurasana - The delicate Peacock Pose, like the Pendant Pose, activates the abdominal muscles of the body and improves blood and lymph flow. It is a difficult pose and beginners can use some support to do it. If you are a beginner, please do not attempt the yoga poses by yourself.

Frequently Asked Questions What is ascites in medical terms? Ascites is the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, causing abdominal swelling. This happens when there is an imbalance in the levels of plasma that flows in and out of the blood and lymph vessels ( [1](http://umm.edu/health/medical/ency/articles/ascites), [2](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=134&contentid=79)). Why does ascites occur in cirrhosis? In cirrhosis, the liver's functions are impaired due to scarring of the liver tissue. There is high blood pressure in the venous system of the liver, i.e., there is portal vein hypertension. As a result of this, fluid accumulates in the abdomen. It is a complex process ( [27](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/ascites-medref)). What is ascites fluid?

What are the complications of ascites? Ascites, if left untreated, can lead to severe complications. These complications are related to infections or are due to the excess pressure that has built-up on the abdominal organs: - Bacterial peritonitis (infection of the ascitic fluid) - Kidney failure - Protein malnutrition - Hepatic encephalopathy - Severe liver complications ( [28](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000286.htm)) Can ascites be prevented?

Malignant ascites is due to cancer and there ares malignant (cancer) cells in the ascitic fluid. These cancer cells are usually secondary malignancies of primary tumors of ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic, and uterine origin.

Cancer accounts for about 10% of ascites cases ( [31](https://www.macmillan.org.uk/information-and-support/coping/side-effects-and-symptoms/other-side-effects/ascites.html)). What is an ascitic drain? When medications do not work in removing the fluid build-up, doctors opt for the ascitic drain. It is a process in which a tube is carefully inserted into the abdomen, and the ascitic fluid is drained out into a bag. This process is also called paracentesis (ascitic tap) ( [32](https://www.macmillan.org.uk/information-and-support/coping/side-effects-and-symptoms/other-side-effects/ascites.html)). In some cases, the doctor may even go for liver transplant or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure to manage this condition ( [33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513268/)). How long does it take for ascites to go down?

Yes, but only egg whites are helpful for ascites. Do probiotics help with ascites?
