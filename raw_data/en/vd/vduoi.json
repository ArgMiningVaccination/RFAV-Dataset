RIVM Report 370030002 2 Abstract Trends in drug substances detected in illega l weight-loss medicines and dietary supplements A 2002-2007 survey and health risk analysis Illegal weight-loss products identified in the Ne therlands have become increasingly dangerous from 2002-2007. Analyses showed increasing numbers of counterfeit medicines and of dietary supplements adulterated with drug substances. In addition, herbal ingredients that were banned for safety concerns are being replaced by pharmaceutical drugs. Unknowing use of these pr oducts may lead to psychosis, cardiovascular problems and even to death. This is shown by a trend analysis on 256 suspect samples gathered by four national laboratories in the Netherlands, including the RIVM. Internationally, the use of illegal weight-loss medicines and dietary supplements has led to many cases of serious health damage and occasionally even to death. Because the active ingredients detected in the Netherlands are largely the same as those found in other countries, similar events may occur in this country. It is therefore recommended to register such health complaints in order to gain insight into the scale and severity of the problem. Adulterated dietary supplements pose the highest health risks. Because the medicines used in the product are not mentioned on the labels, consumers are kept unaware of the risks. Consumers assume they are taking a natural product but are unwittingly exposed to dangerous medicines. If adverse effects cannot be readily attributed to an adulterated dietary supplement, adequate medical treatment may be delayed. Health risks are also high for counterfeit medicines because their composition and quality are unreliable and they are taken without prescription.

Each laboratory contributed suspect weight-loss products that had been brought in for analysis by the Dutch inspectorates, customs, police or local pharmacists. A total of 256 suspect weight-loss products were included in the collective database, 83% of which were dietary supplements and 17% were medicines conf iscated outside the official distribution chain. In 90% of the weight-loss products one or more drug substances were identified. A total of 20 different drug substances were identified, mostly ephedrines and sibutramine in moderate to high dosages (Table 2). The weight-loss drugs identified are associ ated with serious adverse effects and have also been frequently identified in weight-loss products in other countries. In an attempt to assess adverse effects in the Netherlands, a national database was accessed for information on potential intoxications after exposure to weight-loss products. Over the period 2002-2004, the database consisted mainly of suspect dietary supplements and a few suspect medicines. The majority of the dietary supplements contained ephedrine, which was legal at that time despite concerns over health risks. After the ban on ephedrines in the Netherlands in 2004, ephedrine remained the predominant drug substance identified in the database of suspect weight-loss products. Although ephedrine was identified less frequently, this was compensated for by an increase in dietary supplements secretly containing sibutramine or designer analogues. Such adulterated dietary supplements are deliberately mislabelled products that claim to be 'all natural' yet contain pharmaceutical drug substances. Another trend observed is the increase in counterfeit weight-loss medicines after 2004. Counterfeit medicines generally either contained the wrong drug su bstance or the correct substance in a lower dose. In addition to a weight-loss drug, counterfeit medicines occasionally also contain the laxative phenolphthalein, which was withdrawn following concerns over its carcinogenicity. Information on potential intoxication after exposure to weight-loss products showed that most cases were related to products claiming to contain ephedrine. After the ban on ephedrine, the number of potential intoxications with ephedrines decreased. However, the number of potential alleged ephedrine-free weight-loss products and 'u nknown' weight-loss products increased. Although none of these products were actually analysed, it is assumed that these products contained ephedrine or sibutramine. Trends in potential ephedrine intoxication for all ages proved to be similar to trends in young children (<13 years old), suggesting that these children have easy access to these products. The overall health risks of illegal weight-loss medicines and dietary supplements have increased with the rise in counterfeit medicines and adulterated dietary supplements. Consumers of these products are unaware of which drug substance they are taking an d how much of it, as are their physicians. In the case of adulterated dietary supplements, consumer s are not even aware they are taking a drug substance. In some countries, the provision of ad equate medical assistance has been hampered by the inability of consumers and physicians to recogni ze the adverse health effects associated with adulterated dietary supplements. RIVM Report 370030002 6 1 Introduction Weight-loss medicines are among the most prominently marketed health products outside the official medicines distribution chain. This market is fed by the growing discord between an overweight Western society, the contemporary id eal figure and the restrictive prescribing of weight-loss medicines. Because weight-loss drugs have reputedly high health risks, their presence in counterfeit medicines and dietary supplements is worrying. 1 This report presents a health risk analysis, based on a database of suspect weight-loss medicines and dietary supplements analysed from 2002-2007. Further information was gathered by searching scientific literature and databases for reports on weight-loss medicines and dietary supplements regarding chemical an alysis and exposures / adverse events. This report intends to provide an overview of th e drug substances identified in suspect weight-loss products, to discuss the consequences for public health and to make recommendations. This report does not investigate the quality or efficacy of suspect samples, nor were all declared ingredients verified for their presence. In the Netherlands, all medicines are subject to the Medicines Act. The Medicines Act is based on European Law defining a medicine to be a formulated product that either contains a drug substance or is presented as a medicine by appearance or claim. A medicine may cure or prevent disease or may act as a prophylactic. However, a formulated product containing a drug substance is only subject to the Medicines Act after a court of justice has decided it is a medicine. Dietary supplements are subject to the Commodities Act. The Commodities Act is based on European Law and has specific legislation regarding dietary supplements. Dietary supplements (e.g. vitamins, minerals, herbal preparations) may be presented in a pharmaceutical form (e.g. tablets, capsules) though may not claim to be medicines and require no pre-marketing evaluation for safety or efficacy. The Commodities Act requires adequate labelling and prohibits the sale of unsafe foods. A section in the Commodities Act covers certain herbals that are banned for human consumption for reasons of safety and toxicity. Such herbals may also be subject to the Medicines Act because the Medicines Act does not discriminate between the synthetic or natural origin of active substances. In this report these herbals will consistently be referred to as dietary supplements. A notorious problem is that new designer analogues of registered medicines are neither automatically subject to the Medicines Act nor to the Commodities Act. Firstly, because designer analogues are unknown to the health authorities th ey cannot be considered as medicines. Secondly, because designer analogues are unknown to science they cannot be considered unsafe or to xic. Thirdly, with respect to adequate labelling, manufacturers may claim that a designer analogue is believed to originate from one of the declared natural ingredients. Suspect weight-loss products were brought in by the Netherlands Health Care Inspectorate (IGZ), enforcing the Dutch Medicines Act and the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA) enforcing the Commodities Act. Suspect weight-loss medicines were confiscated outside the official medicines distribution chain. Complementing the RIVM data over this period are the chemical analysis results of three sister institutes in the Netherla nds. The Netherlands Forens ic Institute (NFI), the Customs Laboratory (DL) and th e Laboratory of Dutch Pharmacists (LNA) of the Royal Dutch Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy (KNMP) have kindly shared their data enabling us to analyze trends on illegal weight-loss medicines creati ng a more representative overview of the illegal market. Samples were taken non-systematically and case by case in the course of enforcement activities and therefore do not neces sarily present a representative picture. A list of inquiries after exposures (possible intoxica tions) to weight-loss products by physicians from 2000-2007 was kindly provided by the National Poisons Information Centre (NVIC). RIVM Report 370030002 7 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Database construction 2.1.1 Sample sources and selection Samples analysed by the four laboratories were brou ght in by the Netherlands Health Care Inspectorate (IGZ), the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA), Dutch Customs, the police or public pharmacists (Figure 1). Suspect weight-loss medicines and dietary supplements were sampled case by case without the objective of random sampling. Suspect medicines were brought in for analysis following confiscation outside the official distri bution chain. The motives for analyzing suspect products are given in Figure 1.

No attempts were made to perform a complete chemical or botanical analysis, to verify the accuracy of the entire declared composition or to verify any potential weight-loss efficacy. Each laboratory entered th e analysis data into their own la boratory database. The laboratory databases and the (searchable) para meters entered were not necessar ily the same. In general, the datasets contained information on the product name, appearance and the drug substance(s) identified. Dosage and product claim (indication) had generally not been investigated or had not been entered into the laboratory database. RIVM Report 370030002 8 Illegal weight-loss products were filtered out of the laboratory databases by searching on: 1) product names of weight-loss medicines (e.g. Reductil, Orlistat), 2) product claims (e.g. slimming, weight-loss) and 3) known drug substances used in weight -loss products (e.g. amphetamine, ephedrine). Search terms 1 and 2 would retrieve weight-loss products containing any drug substance or no drug substance. Search term 3 was used to retrieve products for which the active weight-loss ingredient was entered into the laboratory database and had no sear chable name or claim. Search term 3 would not return weight-loss products in which drug substances were absent or had no known use in weight-loss. 2.1.2 Classification into categories The samples entered into the database of suspect weight-loss products in this survey were classified as shown in Figure 2. The samples were first classified as a medicine or a dietary supplement based on the product claim. If no claim had been recorded, the classification was made based on the recorded visual presentation of the packaging, the tablets or capsu les. Tablets and capsules brought in for analysis without any packaging were generally classified as medicines unless the content was described as natural or herbal. Database of suspect weight-loss products Illegal Illegal Counterfeit Adulterated Legal medical claim or presentation?yes no Medicines genuine?yes no approved in NL?Dietary supplements banned ingredients on the label?yes yes yesno no nobanned ingredients present? Legal Figure 2 Decision tree for the classification of suspect weight-loss products in the database The medicines were classified as 'genuine' or 'counterfeit', based on appearance and chemical analysis. Genuine medicines were further classified as 'approved' or 'unapproved' for the Dutch market: legal medicines or illegal medicines. The distinction between 'approved' and 'unapproved' was made to enable categorizing authentic foreign medi cines that are not available on the official Dutch market. Legal medicines may be included in the database of suspect weight-loss products if they were considered suspicious at the time of sampling. Coun terfeit medicines are consider ed an illegal copy or imitation of any authentic medicine. The product categories and examples are given in Table 1. Dietary supplements were classified into three categ ories. If banned ingredients were declared on the label, then the products were classified as illegal dietary supplements, regardless of the results of the chemical analysis. For products with no banned ingredients declared on the label further classification depended on the results of the chemical analysis.* 2 * Because of health risk concerns over dietary supplements with ephedrines prior to their ban, these contemporary legal dietary supplements were considered suspect weight -loss products at the time of sampling. RIVM Report 370030002 9 When no banned ingredients were detected, products were classified as legal dietary supplements, based on the few parameters investigated. When undeclared drug substances were identified, products were classified as adulterated dietary supplements. The possibility of products being accidentally contaminated with weight-loss drug substances is not considered. Any dietary supplement containing undeclared drug substances is considered adulterate d, implying the intentional act of tampering with the product. The nature of the adulterant - a natural or pharmaceutical drug substance - was not considered in this classification, only the fact that it was secretly present. It was not verified whether the declared natural drug substances actually had natural origins. Unapproved ingredients with a molecular structure related to that of known pharmaceutical drug substances are regarded as designer analogues and treated as medicines in this report, regardless of the product in which they were found. Table 1 Product categories for the Netherlands and examples Product categories Examples Legal medicines Authentic Reductil (sibutramine) Illegal medicines Authentic Meridia (sibutramine) Counterfeit medicines A copy or imitation of Reductil Legal dietary supplements A product marketed as a dietary supplement in which no banned drug substances were identified nor were they declared on the label. Illegal dietary supplements A product marketed as a dietary supplement claiming to contain ephedrines. Adulterated dietary supplements A product marketed as a dietar y supplement yet containing drug substance (e.g. sibutramine). 2.1.3 Interpretation Ephedrines\u00a7 were banned from dietary supplements in 2004 and thus their product category changed from legal dietary supplements to illegal dietary s upplements. Because ephedrines are frequently used in weight-loss products, it was decided to analyze trends in the period before the ban (2002-2004) and after the ban (2005-2007). The regulatory status of synephrine ( Citrus aurantium ) is unclear. However, as synephrine was patented in 1931 (DE566,578) as an adrenergic dr ug substance, was used as a medicine, and health risks have been described2, it is regarded a medicine in this survey. The database of suspect weight-lo ss products was initially considered to analyze trends in the main categories of medicines and dietary supplements. Trends were then considered for the six product categories. Finally, all identified drug substances were considered together, to assess trends and health risks. It should be noted that in the time span this report covers some herbal preparations have become banned substances. Ephedra species (ephedrine alkaloids) were banned from foodstuffs in 2004 and yohimbine in 2007 . Hoodia gordonii (P57, a steroid) is considered an endangered species since 2005 a nd is therefore illegal to import. Currently known designer number of structurally related alkaloids with the highest levels for ephedrine. For convenience, this report will refer to ephedra alkaloids as 'ephedrines '. In this report no distinction is made between ephedrines used as an energizer or an appetite suppressant. RIVM Report 370030002 10 2.2 Database survey at the NVIC All products containing pharmacological drug substanc es may cause adverse effects. Attributing these adverse effects to illegal weight-loss medicines and dietary supplements is only possible if the actual product is investigated following a health complain t to IGZ, VWA or a pharmacist. Since these cases are rare it was attempted to link the laboratory cases to incidences of poisoning. Therefore, our collaboration was extended to include the Na tional Poisons Information Centre (NVIC). If a consumer or a patient reports a health complaint to a physician and poisoning is suspected, the physician may voluntarily contact the NVIC for in formation. The NVIC records information on the exposure (name of the substance/product, time, amount, route of exposure) and on the subject (age, bodyweight). Based on these data and additional factors, such as duration of (chronic) exposure, underlying diseases and use of medication, the NVIC informs physicians about the potential severity of the poisoning, possible symptoms and treatment opt ions. The NVIC receives around 37,000 inquiries each year about some 50,000 exposures. ** These data reflect the trends and epidemiology of poisonings in the Netherlands. The NVIC relies solely on label information provided by the physician and does not perform any chemical analysis on the products involved. To search the NVIC database the NVIC was provided with all the names of weight-loss products analysed by the four laboratori es from 2002-2007, chemical names and general search terms (e.g. slimming, weight-loss). The products were classified as a medicine or as a dietary supplement, based on the information recorded by the NVIC. 2.3 Literature survey Relevant scientific literature was gathered through bibliographic search engines on the internet (Pubmed, Winspirs) using the following search terms or combinations thereof; slimming, weight-loss, safety, adulterated, counterfeit, herbal, dietary supplement, pulmonary hypertension, death, kidney failure and liver damage. RIVM reports on ephedra3 and so-called smartshops4 were used for background information. ** The number of exposures is higher than the number of inquiries because of mu ltiple exposures in the same patient. RIVM Report 370030002 11 3 Results 17% 83%3.1 Database of suspect weight-loss products Of all the suspect samples brought in for analysis from 2002-2007, a total of 256 products were included in the database of suspect weight-loss pr oducts. The RIVM contributed 89 suspect samples, the LNA 18 samples, the NFI 128 samples and the DL 21 samples. In Appendix 1 the analysis results are listed for the samples analysed by each of the four laboratories from 2002-2007. The following data are listed: the year of analysis, product name, appearance, dosage form, API identified and content. The entry was left blank when no data were available. The main classification of the samples into medicines and dietary supplements is shown in Figure 3a. Suspect dietary supplements make up an average of 83% of the samples and suspect medicines 17%. Trends in the database of suspect weight-loss prod ucts show the number of medicines increasing since the ban on ephedrines in 2004 (Figure 3b). The share in suspect medicines has risen from 10% in 2002-2004 to 25% in 2005-2007.

Until 2005 mostly legal medicines (diuretics) and counterfeit medicines (caffeine instead of phentermine) were identified. Illegal medicines were identified on two occasions and concerne d diuretics only. From 2005, the proportion of counterfeit medicine increased sharply comprising products such as counterfeit Meridia, Reductil, Adipex, Xenical and Ionamin. Among the medicines, the proportion of counterfeits doubled to almost 90%. Table 2 shows counterfeits of brand medicines identified, their composition and the number of cases detected. Eight counterfeits of unknown brands were not included in this table. Counterfeit Xenical was the only counterfeit medicine that did not contain a drug substance. Other counterfeit medicines mostly either contained the wrong drug substance or the correct substance usually in a lower amount. The only legal medicines analysed were the weight-loss medicines Reductil and Xenical supplem entAdulterated dietary supplem ent Figure 4 Trends in product categories in the database of suspect weight-loss products over 2002-2004 (left bars) and 2005-2007 (right bars).

Few adulte rated dietary supplements were identified, and no dietary supplements with banned ingredients declared on the label were identified. About 98% (n = 119) of the suspect samples were legal dietary supplements but were not without health risks. The vast majority (n = 105) contained ephedrines, usually accompanied by high levels of caffeine and synephrine. Over the period 2005-2007 the database of suspect weight-loss products contained a total of 90 suspect dietary supplements for weight-loss, 62% (n = 56) containing ephedrines, now being categorised as dietary supplements containing banned drug substances. The share in legal dietary supplements decreased to 13% (n = 11) usually involving products containing caffeine, vitamins and amino-acids. The decrease in products with ephe drines is compensated for by a dr astic increase (8x) in adulterated dietary supplements (mainly sibutramine). 3.1.3 Drug substances identified Out of the 256 weight-loss products in the database of suspect weight-loss products, 8 did not contain a drug substance (Table 3). In the remaining 248 we ight-loss products a total of 20 different drug substances were identified; 16 pharmaceutical drug substances and 4 naturally occurring drug substances. One ingredient was detected that could not be identified. Table 4 shows the combinations of ingredients found in the period 2002-2007. Figure 5a shows the trends in the therapeutic class of the drugs substances in the database of suspect weight-loss product.

The vast majority of these dietary supplements were products claiming to contain ephedrines. However, as none of these samples were analysed in a laboratory the actual ingredients remain unknown. Even though the NVIC database and the laboratory database have several ephedrine related product names in common, this does not mean that these are of the same composition. RIVM Report 370030002 15 The number of exposures to ephe drines increased 10-fold from 2000-2004. This may be attributed to increasing dosages observed in that period but also to the public awareness of the risks (and benefits) that ephedrines received from 1999-2001.3-6 In that period health concerns over ephedrines prompted large scale sampling and chemical analysis by the inspectorates providing the fundaments for the 2004 ban. After being banned in 2004 the number of inquiries gradually subsided to the 2000-2001 level (Figure 6). In 2004 the first exposures were reporte d for dietary supplements marketed as 'ephedrine free' and this number has since remained rather constant. Figure 6 shows the total number of exposures to ephe drines in young children (<13 years old), for all ages, and the total number of samples in which ephedr ines were identified. In this figure trends in exposures are clearly not matched by trends in the identification of ephedrines. Exposure to weight-l oss medicines regularly results in consultations with the NVIC. In general it was not possible to discriminate legal from counterfeit medicine or prescribed medicine from unprescribed medicine. The majority of exposures are recorded for the diuretics furosemide and spironolacton, although these are few (respectively 0.002% and 0. 003% in 2007) in relation to the number of prescriptions. The number of inquiries after exposures to Reductil and Xenical in relation to the number of prescriptions are somewhat higher (respectively 0.009% and 0.02% in 2007). 020406080100120140 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007NVIC (all ages) Laboratories NVIC (<13 years old) Figure 6 Total number of exposures reported for ephedrin es in young children (<13 years old), all ages, and the number of samples in which ephedrines we re identified by the laboratories Retrospectively, it is not possible to distinguish the intention of the overdose from the NVIC inquiries. Some people may have taken diuretics for weight-loss purposes; however other causes, such as suicide attempts (with multiple drug intake, including a diuretic) and accidental overdosing, are included in these figures. Surprising is the sudden increase in the number of reported exposures to unknown weight-loss tablets and capsules to the NVIC in 2006-2007 (Appendix 2). Although, the actual content of both types of products is unknown, the presen ce of sibutramine or ephedrines is suspected. When considering the age of the exposed persons it be comes apparent that young children (< 13 years old) significantly contribute to the total number of ex posures. In the case of exposures to medicines this contribution is probably accidental and unrelated to weight-loss. Therefore, this number was excluded Number of prescriptions derived from the Drug Information Syst em of the Health Care Insura nce Board (www.GIPdatabank.nl). RIVM Report 370030002 16 from the dataset. However, this may be different in the case of dietary supplements. The trend observed for exposures to ephedrines in young children matche s the trend observed for all ages (Figure 6). This indicates that adults do not recognize the risk of di etary supplements, or do not keep them securely out of reach, and may even give these supplements to (obese) children. Young ch ildren contributed to almost 50% of the exposures to 'unknown weight-loss products' in 2006-2007 (n = 23). 3.2 Literature survey The bibliographic search engines predominantly return ed scientific reports on the use and effectiveness of weight-loss drug substances and on their detection in dietary supplements. Casualties caused by genuine medicines, adulterated dietary supplements and unsafe natural products were reported regularly. Literature describes that fighting overweight is but one reason to seek pharmaceutical or herbal assistance in losing weight. Other reasons include the desire to minimize body fat among bodybuilders and slimming for pathological reasons (e.g. anorexia). The drug substances used to promote weight loss include stimulants that suppress appetite, metabolism altering agents and substances being abused for weight-loss purposes like laxatives and diuretics (Figure 5a). Laxatives and diuretics are predominantly abused by subjects with eating disorders, but also by bodybuilders and athletes. 7-9 As several laxatives are currently available in the Netherlands without prescription, there seems to be no reason for consumers to buy suspect weight-loss products. However, diuretics cannot be obtained without a prescription and are also traded for weight-loss purposes outside the official medicines distribution chain. Although ne ither laxatives nor diuretic s are considered to be real weight-loss drugs, the rapid results caused by dehydration may cause consumers to perceive otherwise. Efficacious weight-loss drugs have been associated with unacceptable morbidity and mortality for over a century. Despite the risks the prospect of losing weight fast and effortless is still tempting many. The booming trade in shady weight-loss produc ts is therefore a worrying development. 10 Modern pharmaceutical management of bodyweight reduction probably started in 1893 with the introduction of weight-loss medicines based on thyroid hormones. 1 About half a century later the introduction of dinitrophenol (DNP) and amphetamine followed. Since then, the world has seen the regular introduction of new weight-loss drug substa nces, mostly stimulants acting as an appetite suppressant. However, by the time the weight-loss drugs orlistat (Xenical) and sibutramine (Reductil, Meridia) were introduced in 1997-1998, almost all of their predecessors had been banned for causing unacceptable health risks. 1 Thyroid hormones were withdrawn in the 1980s after being associated with cardiac problems and sudden death. Many stimulants (e.g. amphetamine, aminorex) were withdraw n after being associated with dependency, palpitations, pulmonary hypertension and valvular heart disease. DNP was withdrawn for causing a variety of adverse ev ents but is still available on the internet 11 and regularly causes fatalities by starting an uncontrollable cycle resulting in dehydration, exhaustion and (potentially lethal) high body temperatures. 12-17 The internet suggests that DNP is mostly used in bodybuilding circles and the dangers are generally well described.11 For sibutramine there were safety co ncerns relating to the potential cardiovascular risks. A large scale study focusing on these cardiovascular risks demonstrated sibutramine to be safe even in high-risk subjects. 18 However, other serious side effects (e.g. psychosis) are reported for sibutramine in legal medicines19-23 and adulterated dietary supplements alike.10,24,25 Acute psychosis in patients with a latent RIVM Report 370030002 17 morbidity is described in the patient information l eaflet (PIL). Therefore, the non-prescriptive or unwitting use of sibutramine or its analogues is explicitly dangerous. Using dietary supplements as a weight-loss aid is described to be mostly ineffective and, despite public perception, not necessarily safe.26-33 Effective dietary supplements usually contain stimulants (e.g. ephedrine, norephedrine) which were banned from dietary supplements in the Netherlands in 2004 for health risk concerns. 1,34 RIVM Report 370030002 18 4 Discussion 4.1 Ingredients and risks Before market authorisation is granted for a medicine in the Netherlands, the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board (CBG) thoroughly reviews different aspects of the product. Medicines can be authorised when a positive risk/benefit ratio is as certained. The benefit is the expected improvement of one's condition, and the risk is the possible adverse effects caused by the medication or its formulation. Medicines are strictly regulated in order to minimize the health risks of the adverse effects. Therefore, pharmacology, toxicology, indication for use, and also technical quality are among the aspects judged by the Medicines Evaluation Board. For prescribed medicines it is important that a physician assesses whether an individual patient should receive a certain medicine. Factors like physical co ndition, medical history, and/or the use of other medicines could prevent a physician from prescrib ing a medicine. A person using prescription medication without consulting a physician is deliberately taking a risk which may cost the individuals health and the health care system (e.g. hospital admissions, days not a work). Literature clearly states that weight-loss medicines pose a high health risk in certain people, especial ly after long-term use. Therefore, weight-loss medicines are prescribed restrictively and usually in combination with a programme to change a patient's lifestyle. In order to limit the health risks for weight-loss drugs, the risk/benefit ratio needs to be assessed and monitored by a physician. This necessity is emphasised by the market withdrawals of many unsafe weight-loss me dicines in the past and th e present withdrawal of the promising weight-loss drug Acomplia (rimonabant) 35. Medicines analysed by the laboratories in this report were prescribed-only medicines, confiscated outside the official medicines distribution chain. Consumers using these products do so without consulting a physician and are therefore endangering themselves. In addition, the uncertainty about the drug substance actually present, its dose, the formul ation and contaminants increases the health risk. As dietary supplements are more loosely regulated th an medicines, the risk/ben efit ratio does not need to be evaluated before market introduction. Thus, for dietary supplements there is an inherent uncertainty about presence of the drug substance, its dose, the formulation and contaminants. This survey has also shown that in many cases product la bels cannot be trusted, th us increasing the health risks. Furthermore, consumers of dietary supplements are not likely to consult their physician on such matters, therefore increasing the health risks even further. A notorious problem is that dietary supplements co ntaining new designer analogues of registered medicines are not automatically subject to the Medicines Act or to the Commodities Act. Firstly, because designer analogues are unknown to the health authorities cannot be considered as medicines. Secondly, because designer analogues are unknown to science they cannot be considered unsafe or toxic. Thirdly, with respect to adequate labeli ng, manufacturers may claim a designer analogue is believed to originate from one of the declared natural ingredients. The most important factors contributing to the total health risk are (i) the pharmacological risk caused by the drug substance and its dose, (ii) whether or not the drug substance is declared on the label, and (iii) whether or not the drug substance was prescribed and in what dose regimen. The collective database of the four laboratories mostly contains information on the drug substance alone. Dosage is estimated infrequently and label information is rarely present. The database of suspect weight-loss RIVM Report 370030002 19 products does not contain any information about the consumers. The health risks are therefore assessed by taking into account th e drug substances used. 4.1.1 Laxatives Phenolphthalein is a laxative that was withdrawn as a medicine several years ago after concerns about carcinogenicity. It was the only laxative found by the laboratories and was not reported to the NVIC. Phenolphthalein was identified as the single drug substance in counterfeit Reductil and in combination with sibutramine in several dietary supplements in 2006-2007. It is unclear why phenolphthalein has recently su rfaced in several weight-loss products, because laxatives are not very effective as weight-loss drugs.8 Phenolphthalein by itself does not present an acute health risk in the dosages found, but as it is cheap and widely available it is expected to be identified more frequently in the future. Long-term exposure to phenolphthalein should be prevented because of cancer risks. Also, the abuse of laxatives in general, always carries a risk of organ damage resulting from dehydration. 8 Exposures to phenolphthalein were not reported to the NVIC, which is not surprising considering it seems to primarily be used secretly in counterfeit medicine or adulterated dietary supplements. 4.1.2 Diuretics Diuretics were mainly detected in genuine medici nes, but not all were registered for use in the Netherlands. Diuretics, like laxatives, are not very effective as weight-loss drugs but have similar health risks.8 Genuine approved diuretics, even when traded illegally, do not present a large health risk. Because the majority of the diuretics concerned legal medicine it may be assumed consumers are informed about the properties of the medicine and the risks associated. Risks are higher for the unwitting users of adulterated dietary supplements with diuretics, altho ugh so far no casualties have been reported in literature. 36,37 The identification of some anti-epileptic drugs with diuretic properties in counterfeit medicines together with ephedrine is raising concerns over the potential effects. Although such a product seems to pose a health risk, it was only identified on one occasion. 4.1.3 Stimulants The main stimulants identified in the period 2002-2004 were ephedrines, synephrine and caffeine. Products frequently contain combinations of these ingredients in efficacious dosages (Appendix 1). Since the ban on ephedrines in 2004 they are still regularly detected by DL, an d the NFI. Their illegal use elsewhere in Europe is illustrated by a recent series of adverse events including one death in Denmark attributed to the use of such products purchased over the internet. 38 After the ban on ephedrines, manufacturers changed to using the weaker stimulant synephrine, although it was not identified by the laboratories more frequently. Although several Dutch web stores claim synephrine to be legal it is actually subject to the Medicines Act. Web stores also claim to offer other legal alternatives in dietary supplements with herbs known to contain stimulant drug substances (e.g. phenylethylamines). It is unclear whether these drug substances are actually present, whether they are legal, and what their effect would be. As of 2005, moderate levels of sibutramine were frequently identified in counterfeit medicines and dietary supplements. It seems that in the industrialised countries sibutramine is becoming the most popular drug substance in illegal weight-loss products . One of the three designer drugs of sibutramine known today has been identified by the RIVM and DL in an adulterated dietary supplement. 24 The increased use of sibutramine in illegal weight-loss products is not reflected in the exposures recorded by the NVIC. This may largely be attributed to sibutramine not being declared on the label of RIVM Report 370030002 20 these dietary supplements and thus not being recogn ised as a causative agen t in intoxications. Such adulterated dietary supplements may be listed unde r the increasing number of 'unknown weight-loss products' (Appendix 2), and these products were not analysed. 4.1.4 Vitamins / amino-acids The vitamins and amino-acids found in this survey are frequently used in weight-loss products in high dosages but their efficacy is doubtful. The ingr edients are allowed when in compliance with the Commodities Act. 4.1.5 Others The lipase inhibitor orlistat (Xenical) was the only other weight-loss drug identified in the database of suspect weight-loss products. It was present in the database only once, as a legal medicine. None of the counterfeit Xenical capsules contained a drug substance. Though some exposures were reported to the NVIC, Xenical is not considered a potential health risk and is available over-the-counter in some countries. Surprisingly, the number of exposures r ecorded by the NVIC for Xenical and Reductil are similar even though Reductil is prescribed more often. Four pharmaceutical drug substances were detected th at have no specific bearing on losing weight but may have an auxiliary function. Noticeably absent in the database of suspect weight-loss products and the NVIC database were (counterfeit) Acomplia (rimonabant), DNP and thyroid hormone preparations. Suspect Acomplia is widely availabl e outside the official distribution chain and Dutch web-forums suggest that DNP and thyroid hormones are still used. Because Acomplia was recently withdrawn from the official market it is an intere sting case for monitoring the impact on the illegal trade. 4.1.6 or the combinations of sibutramine / phenolphthalein and phentoin / phenobarbital / ephedrine. 4.2 Trends lements were also found in the inantly identified changed from legal to counterfeit medicines and adulterated dietary supplements. Combinations of ingredients The combinations of ingredients iden tified are listed in table 4. The potentially hazardo us combinations are combinations involving ephedrin e, caffeine and synephrine or salicy lic acid. Interaction profiles are unknown f Literature increasingly reports on dietary supplements adulterated with thyroid preparations, weight-loss drug substances and designer analogues. 24,25,39-49 Adulterated dietary weight-loss products are responsible for most hospital admissions reported, involving symptoms of psychosis, poisoning and liver damage. 10 A case of mass poisoning was reported in Japan in 2002 where a designer analogue of fenfluramine in a herbal tea was linked to over 800 cases of serious health damage and some deaths. 39,45 Similar clinical cases are reported on a smaller scale in Singapore and the United Kingdom.50,51 Since this survey has shown that adulterated dietary supp Netherlands, it is expected that clinical cases will surface in the future. The availability of counterfeit Xenical, Reductil and Meridia (outside of the official distribution chain) and illegal dietary supplements has increased enormously since 2002. The majority of the pharmaceutical drug substances identifi ed in these products changed from diuretics to sibutramine. At the same time the products in which they were predom E.g. two anti-epileptic drugs, phentoin and phenobarbital, were identified in a dietary supplement together with ephedrine. RIVM Report 370030002 21 The naturally occurring drug substances identified were predominantly ephedrines, synephrine and caffeine, frequently in combination with each other. The share of weight-loss dietary supplements in which ephedrines were detected decreased from 88% in 2002-2004 to 62% in 2005-2007. In our set of data this decrease in ephedrines is compensated for by the increase in the identification of sibutramine and its analogues in adulterated dietary supplements and counterfeit medicines. As with the illegal erectogenics, suspect weight-loss medicines and adulterated dietary supplements are likely to contain one or more of any drug substa nce in dosages high enough to produce a noticeable effect. By doing so, manufacturers s eem to be increasingly interested in creating a loyal customer base and a stable market. A stable market for finished products is unlikely to be achieved through sustained infiltration of counterfeits into the well-protected official medicines distribution chain. In the long-term there is more to gain and less to risk in creating a stable market parallel to the official market. Besides, Xenical and Reductil are prescribed restrictively, resulting in a small official market in the Netherlands. Manufacturers of suspect weight-loss dietary supplements seem to become aware of the pharmacological, analytical and legal aspects of their trade. Firstly, their use of designer drugs and of herbs with naturally occurring analogues of ephedrine shows that they keep up with scientific media and patent literature. Secondly, by using dietary supplements as a matrix to hide drug substances the identification process is slowed down and confus ion created over their legal status. Thirdly, manufacturers and retailers know that it is hard to prove criminal intent when trading adulterated dietary supplements. Once caught, one can credib ly claim of being unaware of a pharmaceutical 'contamination' because testing commodities for pharmaceutical adulterants is no t a prerequisite before marketing. In the present study, there are safety concerns with 21 of the 26 of the ingredients detected. Sibutramine and its designer analogues, ephedrines, and synefrine are considered to pose the highest risk. One of the main concerns is that subjects usually take weight-loss medicines or dietary supplements on a daily basis over a prolonged time. Initial results or lack of initial result may prompt consumers to increase their dosage to a dangerous level. 16 Adverse events may be treated properly if a connection can be made between the symptoms and the product. For adulterated dietary supplements and counterfeit medicine this connection is often hard to make beca use one is unaware of the product not being what it seems. In addition, a subject experiencing a psychotic episode caused by sibutramine is unlikely to be of any help in relating medical or dietary history during anamneses. The explosive growth in Ritalin (methylphenidate) prescriptions may result in the medicine being abused as a weight-loss drug. Though this behaviour on a limited scale has been reported abroad, there are no indications of such a trend in the Netherlands at present. 52 4.3 Conclusions The health risks of illegal weight-loss medicines and dietary supplements have increased from 2002- 2007. The increase can mainly be attributed to consumers being misled by deliberately mislabelled dietary supplements and by the availability of counterfeit medicines of unreliable composition outside the official distribution chain. The use of moderate but efficacious dosages of drug substances is creating a false sense of reliability of the unofficial system. The drug substances detected in this survey were al so detected in suspect weight-loss products analysed by other countries. The ingredients that reportedly caused the most serious casualties in the UK, Germany and throughout South-East Asia (DNP, usnic acid, nitroso-fenfluramine) were not observed in this survey with the exception of sibutramine and its analogues. However, the use of DNP in the Netherlands is suspected after monitoring Dutch web forums on bodybuilding. Dangerous drug RIVM Report 370030002 22 substances not yet identified in the Netherlands have turned up within the European Union and may surface in the future. Provided no large scale accidents are reported in the media, consumers' trust in illegal weight-loss products will grow to a level that may undermine trus t in the official system. To a certain extent this has already happened as prices for illegal weight-loss medicines and dietary supplements often are comparable to prices of the legal medicines. It seems that outside of the official distribution chain consumers expect a positive correlation between price and efficacy. Once their expectation has been confirmed, the satisfied customer returns for more of the same. The inquiries at the NVIC following exposures to we ight-loss products are an opportunity to link suspect medicines and dietary supplements to drug substances and adverse events. A more vigorous follow-up by the NVIC may help uncover more cases of health damage. 4.4 Limitations of the study This survey is not the result of coherent sampling as samples were brought in for analysis case by case. With the participation of multiple laboratories, the authors aim to draw the be st representative picture available. However, as each laboratory serves its ow n specific (legal) task, different parameters may be investigated to meet their own objectives. Therefor e, important data for asse ssing health risks (e.g. dosage) was infrequently available. In addition, samples were not consistently entered into a database as a weight-loss product. In such cases database searches on drug substances only generated samples that had tested positive for weight-loss drug substances, while samples with no or other drug substances were missed. The authors realize that adverse events are bound to be underreported by the unwitting users of dangerous dietary supplements as well as those knowingly using illegal products. Even when complaints are reported and recognised very few will make it into a scientific publication. Therefore, the cases reported in literature probably only repr esent a small proportion of the actual cases. Although the NVIC data gives a good indication of the occurrence of actual exposures, the data is limited by not knowing the actual ingredients, dosage or intended use. 4.5 Recommendations 1. Harmonize and expand the analysis parameters reco rded by laboratories, as this would greatly improve the coherence of the dataset and facilitate the health risk assessment. Ingredients, dose, label information and intended use are the most valuable analysis parameters. 2. Designer analogues of registered medicines should automatically be made subject to the Medicines Act. 3. Dieticians and physicians should warn their clients against the risks of buying weight-loss medicines outside of the official medicine distribution chain and advise caution when buying dietary supplements to aid weight loss. 4. The use of dietary supplements should be aske d for at hospital admissions. In the case of a suspected intoxication the product should be retrieved and analysed. Follow-up of inquiries at the NVIC could be helpful in identifying such cases and in linking actual symptoms in patients to ingredients identified by analysis. RIVM Report 370030002 23 5. Measures should be taken to prevent the further formation of a stable and highly accessible market in illegal weight-loss medicines and dietary supplements parallel to the official market. 6. Undertake international action against notorious manufacturers of adulterated dietary supplements. 7. Initiate a public warning campaign against suspect dietary weight-loss products. 8. Investigate the background of inquires at the NVI C after exposures to weight-loss products with a special focus on intoxications in (young) children. 9. Investigate the consequences of the market withdrawal of Acomplia (rimonabant) with respect to the trade in (counterfeit) Acomplia outside of the official distribution chain. 10. Investigate the impact on the health of consumers of illegal weight-loss products and the evolving costs (e.g. first aid, hospital admissions, non-productive days).
