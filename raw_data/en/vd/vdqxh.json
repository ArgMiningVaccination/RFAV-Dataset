The center is part of an incredible project that includes the ceremony center, a museum, restaurant and a small shop. Joel made me and my wife feel safe, cared for and his incredible knowledge about natural medicine is inspiring. We had an incredible experience in a private ceremony. I did ayahuasca and my wife did rap\u00e9. We're both going back to continue our spiritual journey with our shaman and friend, Joel. - 910loganf00Beautiful healing experienceMauricio is amazing. He did such a beautiful job of leading the ceremony. I did two days with him and they were absolutely incredible. - Mustardman66600Life Changing ExperienceAn absolutely amazing time. I feel more healed from past trauma and issues. This experience was truly amazing. - cormacm87900Most amazing magical spiritual and healing experience of my lifeI was initially very nervous to drink Ayahuasca, even in spite of the good reviews and recommendations I got from other travellers. Eventually I decided to at least talk with the Shaman to see if it was something i would feel safe to do. Mauricio and Joel are two of the most loving and calming people I have ever met. They completely understood my apprehension and managed to calm all of my insecurities and nerves from the initial conversation. By the time my ceremony came around, 5 days after the initial meeting, I had some nervousness about the experience again. Once more, Joel and Mauricio were very calming and allowed me to take everything at my own pace. Around 25 minutes after drinking the plant medicine, I felt the energy from the Ayahuasca building within my body, originating from somewhere in my chest. The energy, while intense, was overwhelmingly positive. I purged (vomited) briefly, which seemed to release any remaining nervousness from my body. After that, I had an intense connection with the medicine, which allowed me to investigate any questions or issues I had with myself, but all the while being completely conscious and feeling positive. I felt the energy and overall effect of the medicine throughout my body, primarily in my chest, but at all times I felt my mind to be completely clear, conscious and in control. (My main fear beforehand was that my mind might be overwhelmed by the experience and be overcome by nervousness. This couldn't have been further from what I experienced.) For anyone interested in taking part in an Ayahuasca ceremony, I strongly recommend to at least talk to Joel and Mauricio and make a decision after that. I'm sure that after talking to them you'll have the confidence in them and yourself to take part in what for me was one of the most positive and energising experiences of my life. Thanks so much Joel and Mauricio. - janadF5492XF00Magic experienceI had two Ayahuasca ceremony in Portal of light and both of them were amazing, I felt so much love for everyone around me and I was able to understand and achieve my intentions. Joel and Mauricio are definitely the best ones, they were there all the time helping me and saying words of affirmation, I felt safe and comfortable. I highly recommend them, I'm coming back to do my third one for sure. I can only say thank you for helping to connect to my true self and to the universe. - j2dc00Amazing experience, amazing shaman, amazing ceremony, healingSo happy I went with the guys in portal of light. Mauricio my shaman was everything I had hoped and wished for. For me the setting, environment, and getting to meet and speak with the shaman before the ceremony was a big part of my criteria when choosing to go with the guys here at the portal of light. Mauricio was most helpful and accommodating with all my questions and responding to all my texts. Two days before the ceremony we were invited to the temple and museum. My girlfriend was quite anxious and apprehensive about the whole thing being somewhat uneducated and ignorant to the power of the medicine which is ayahuascha. Again Mauricio was most understanding helping to put both of our minds at ease. These were all the elements that were a massive part in setting the tone for the ceremony. The ceremony itself was magical. I cannot quite explain the connection and relationship that shaman Mauricio and I enjoyed but he did such a great job in guiding me, protecting me, reassuring me, and making me feel safe and comfortable at all times. I'm going back for two more ceremonies in the coming days and I am truly optimistic and grateful for the experience and for the love and support of shaman Mauricio and Joel. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. - There4ndBack4gain00Begining of a spiritual journeyThe shamen at portal of light was very accommodating leading up to the ceremony. I wanted to check him and the place out before making a reservation just to make sure I felt comfortable with him, the environment, and taking the Ayahuasca. He answered all of our questions and made us feel very comfortable. He was very patient and informational. During the ceremony he did a nice job of making the area feel safe and comfortable to aid towards a good experience. He even kept in communication with my girl friend through text who apparently was blowing up his phone making sure I was safe. He said prayers and played native instruments that was very nice cultural experience as well. He helped during difficult times of the ceremony and offered a good space to talk about the experience afterwards. It's been a few months since my Ayahuasca journey and I am very grateful I took it. It has awakened me spiritually and set me on a path I don't think I would have been on otherwise. - tthnll00Gracias JoelJoel is a very unique person with a pure heart. Listen and understand his words, it will help you heal, and learn how to heal yourself. Thank you Joel for guiding me through and being my friend during my internal journey. - HANK C00** HIDDEN GEM ** AMAZING EXPERIENCEOverall an amazing and wonderful experience. The Shaman Joel is really committed to his craft. You can tell within minutes he cares deeply. Traveling and planning is tough. Time was an issue for me that week but the shaman made it all work. I managed to see him in the afternoon then booked another one at a later day. Both ceremonies went smoothly The weather was great that day too. Felt like this was the right choice. And it was. Joel and Ovidio are great healers. The place is local (SAN BLAS) and within walking distance from the main square (short 10m walk), so there's no need to drive up hours back and forth from the city. For sure much safer AND convenient than going to unknown places around the city. Especially true for someone new to Cusco. Knowledgeable. Reliable. Friendly. - and Cash friendly too (receipt available) You can easily book from their website for many of their services. Can't go wrong. Got questions? Just talk to him. He'll work with you. Hit them up on WhatsApp. Very active. Also check out the website for more details and his great BOOK. * The location is going up the city steps (from C. Tandapata street). You'll know you're there once you see the football court to the right. - alex_wanderlust8800Thank you, brother JoelJoel has been very supportive before, during and after the experience. He knows how to keep you calm and seeing things on a different perception. I'll never forget what happened, the images I saw, the sounds I listened to and the sensations I felt. \"Listen your heart. Feel your heart\". Gracias Joel. Gracias Pachamama - amir258000RecommebdShaman Joel was such a heartwarming kind and respectful person. I had the pleasure to do ayahuasca ceremony with him. He took care of me especially when I needed him. If you want to do ayauasca, I definitely recommend him. - 516josem00Healing and LiberationI had an incredible honor to re-visit Joel in Cusco, now a close friend, for my second ayahuasca retreat. Yet again, I had an incredible experience and more understanding of myself and life overall and this incredible human experience we all share. I would depict Joel as a wise understanding person, full of life, and passionate for his healing methods. Through both retreats, he reminded me the importance, meaning, and reverence we should take towards this ancient sacred healing practiced by the Incas. His serenity and wisdom calms and guides you towards an blissful spiritual journey. He's no just any shaman you may encounter in the corners of Cusco. His passion brought him to build the Museo de la Pachamama, a museum that preserves over 5000 plants to share and educate humanity the power of plant and its natural healing abilities and properties. I wish you a great retreat with Joel and a blessing life! - zarahgtraveler00Portal of Light provides a safe and professional healing experienceShaman Joel is passionate about healing with plants and nature. This was my first experience with Kambo and Ayahuasca. With Shaman Joel's guidance I was able to open my heart and begin the healing process. I felt very safe and surrounded by love. Thank you. - dmikall00Amazing!!I booked 1 ceremony thinking, \"well, if I don't like it, I'll choose somewhere else\", I ended up booking 2 more quickly after! One of the 3 was a day trip out to the portal, which was so amazing! I highly recommend that trip! Joel gave us such a unique 1 of kind experience that I haven't been able to find in all my experience with plant medicines. - samanta_chiesorin00Joel is a real medicine manJoel is a real medicine man. I had many ayuasca experiences in my country, Brazil, and for the first time had the chance to join a ceremony in Peru. I really wanted it to be special as it would be the first time of my boyfriend with ayuasca. After doing some research the universe sent me to Joel, the experience we had was priceless. Joel conducted the ceremony in a paradise (which he called Magic Portal), his conduction was pure love. His medicine songs really made the difference. One of the most special ceremonies I've attended, if not the most. After all, I thought it was over when he took us to eat with the local people in such a special picnic where we had the chance to meet some abuelas that cooked a really special and natural food for us. Would never had the chance to do such thing without Joel taking us. It was my best experience in Peru. Pure love and gratitude for this experience.

Be prepare to face your own darkness, and great love from your heart. Written May 23, 2021 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
