Routinely recommended for adolescents at 11-12 years of age Catch up is recommended for anyone not previously vaccinated There is no minimum interval... Especially in situations where benefi t outweighs risk such as a new baby, injury, exposures etc. If patient is receiving a tetanus ca tch up schedule, minimum intervals should be followedTdap4 5 66/14/2023 3 Children age 7-10 years who are not fully immunized against pertussis (i.e., did not complete a series of pertussis-containing vaccine before their seventh birthday ) should receive a single dose of Tdap. If needed, they should complete their series with Td or Tdap. If a Tdap dose is administered at ag e 10 years or older, the Tdap dose may count as the adolescent Tdap dose.TDAP (CONT.) Tdap catch up recommendations for children who were vaccinated at ages 7 - 9. If a child receives DTaP or Tdap at ages 7 - 9, an additional dose of Tdap is needed at age 11. Tdap (cont.)

Vaccines in multidose vials that do not require reconstitution can be used through the expiration date printed on the label as long as the vaccine is not contaminated unle ss indicated otherwise by the manufacturer. IPV in a multidose vial can be used th rough the expiration date on the vial.Open Multidose Vials 10 11 126/14/2023 5 For some vaccines, the manufacturer specifies that once the multidose vial has been entered or the rubber stopper punctured, the vaccine must be used within a certain number of days. This is commonly referred to as the \"beyond-use date\" (BUD). Any vaccine not used within the BUD should be discarded. Specific information regarding the BUD can be found in the product information.Open Multidose Vials (CONT.) Someone at your clinic administered a dose of varicella vaccine IM.

No, because when you down load the monthly report you can assess the temperature then.Do you need to be concerned?19 20 216/14/2023 8 When reviewing daily minimum and maximum temperatures providers should be monitoring for those temp eratures that are outside of the normal range of 2 to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0to 46 \u00b0to +5 \u00b0F). When these occur a provider should assess the length of time the unit was out-of-range and if an alarm occurred providers should take appropriate action for the temperature excursion. Providers should contact the manufacturers, as to determine the viability of the vaccine. Provider should also inform the Immuni zation Unit that an excursion has occurred. This can be done by ema il, phone, or online reporting form found here https://www.hhs.nd.gov/s torage-and-handling . Temperature Monitoring and Excursions IF YOU NOTICE A TEMPERATURE EXCURSION : Contact the primary or backup vaccine coordinator. Document the current, minimum and maximum temperatures, duration of temperature excursion and the time when problem was discove red. Label the vaccine \"Do Not Use.\" Store at the appropriate temperature. If your unit is not maintaining the appropriate temperature, transfer the vaccine to othe r storage units. Do not allow vaccines to remain in a unit while trying to fix it. Contact the manufacturer for further guidance on use of the vaccine, Do not discard vaccine before contacting the manufacturer. If vaccine is wasted, report to the ND Immunization Unit. Complete the online excursion tool to report the temperature excursion and any nonviable vaccine Submit temperature logs to dohtemplogs@nd.gov https://www.hhs.nd.gov/storage-and-handlingTemperature Excursion Handling a temperature excursion 22 23 246/14/2023 9Vaccine Storage Best Practice Any issues with vaccine deliveries should be reported the day the shipment is received.

Is there an issue with the forecaster? A) Since the HPV recommendation for those over age 27 is based on a shared clinical decision by the provider the NDIIS will not forecast the doses. B) The NDIIS forecaster has not been updated to include this age group but will in the future. C) Once a dose of HPV vaccine is administered and documented the NDIIS forecaster will then forecast the rest of the series.Is there an issue with the forecaster?40 41 426/14/2023 15 A) Since the HPV recommendation for those over age 27 is based on a shared clinical decision by the provider the NDIIS will not forecast HPV vaccine after age 26. B) The NDIIS forecaster has not been updated to include this age group but will in the future. C) Once a dose of HPV vaccine is administered and documented the NDIIS forecaster will then forecast the rest of the series.Is there an issue with the forecaster? HPV vaccination for individuals aged 27 - 45 year s old is based on shared clinical decision making. What this means is that HPV vaccine is not ro utinely recommended for everyone ages 27 - 45, but if a provider feels that a patient is at risk and should have it or if a patient requests the vaccine, then the provider can administer it. This type of recommendation also ensures insurance coverage for HPV vaccine for people ages 27 - 45. Insurance companies should be co vering HPV vaccine for this age group, but patients should always check with their insurance first.

One dose of Bivalent COVID19 vaccine at least 8 weeks after any previous monovalent doses followed by an additional bivalent dose 4 months after the first bivalent. C. No additional doses. COVID-19 Vaccine Up-To-Date Everyone 6 years and older is considered up-to-date after they have received 1 bivalent dose of Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Recommendations for children aged 6 months - 5 years vary by brand the child has received. COVID-19 Vaccine Up-To-Date Adults 65+ years may receive another dose of bivalent COVID-19 vaccine at least four months after their previous bivalent dose. Immunocompromised people aged 6 years and older may receive another dose of bivalent COVID-19 vaccine at least two months after their previous bivalent dose. Neither of these recommendations for additional doses count towards the up-to-date status of an individual. COVID-19 Vaccine Up-To-Date67 68 696/14/2023 24 Dr. Katelyn Jetelina (Your Local Epidemiologist) recommends basing the decision to get a \"spring booster\" on two criteria: Risk Factor and Time.Risk Factor - Who is being hospitalized for and with COVID-19? People who haven't already received a dose of bivalent vaccine. Adults over 75 years Adults over the age of 65 years with a comorbidity Moderate or severely immunocompromisedWho needs additional bivalent doses? Time - When was your last infection or vaccine? 6+ months ago: Go get a spring booster today. 4-6 months: Schedule one, but you don't need to rush to the pharmacy. <4 months: Wait. But do not wait until past May/June, so that you enough runway time before the (anticipated) fall vaccine.Who needs additional bivalent doses? I'm interested in providing Jynneos vaccine at community events. What route of administration do we use for that?70 71 726/14/2023 25 A. The vaccine should only be administered intradermally. B. The vaccine should only be administered subcutaneously. C. The vaccine can be administered both intradermally or subcutaneously depending on the age of the patient, preference of the patient and immunizer, and history of keloid scars.Mpox vaccine administration A. The vaccine should only be administered intradermally. B. The vaccine should only be administered subcutaneously. C. The vaccine can be administered both intradermally or subcutaneously depending on the age of the patient, preference of the patient and immunizer, and history of keloid scars.Mpox vaccine administration Earlier in the mpox response when vaccine was in short supply vaccine was administered intradermally outside of rare circumstances. Now that vaccine is more readily available providers are able to administer vaccine either intradermally or subcutaneously. Patients with a history of keloid scars or who are under 18 should always receive vaccine subcutaneously. Mpox vaccine administration73 74 756/14/2023 26 Mpox vaccine administration CDC recommends vaccination against mpox if: You had known or suspected exposure to someone with mpox You had a sex partner in the past 2 weeks who was diagnosed with mpox You are a gay, bisexual, or other man who has sex wi th men or a transgender, nonbinary, or gender- diverse person who in the past 6 months has had any of the following: A new diagnosis of one or more sexually transmitted diseases (e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis) More than one sex partner You have had any of the following in the past 6 months: Sex at a commercial sex venue (like a sex club or bathhouse) Sex related to a large commercial event or in a ge ographic area (city or county for example) where mpox virus transmission is occurring Sex in exchange for money or other items You have a sex partner with any of the above risks You anticipate experiencing any of the above scenarios You have HIV or other causes of i mmune suppression and have had recent or anticipate future risk of mpox exposure from any of the above scenarios Jynneos vaccine ordering is available from NDHHS at Monkeypox Vaccine Providers | HHS (nd.gov). Please note that ordering is in vials, not doses. About 5 intradermal doses or 1 subcutaneous dose can be obtained from one vial.

Many large providers or those with more severe corrective actions will receive visits each year. HHS is required to conduct unannounced storage and handling visits. Some clinics are chosen at random or may be based on previous storage and handling issues along with provider or patient report of issues. VFC Site Visits There are many areas that are covered during a VFC compliance site visit but some of the important and often incorrect areas include: Borrow/return documentation Doses owed to the state that have not yet been repaid Correct storage and handling procedures Review of temperature logs Chart Audit VIS publication dates Current calibrated data loggers Current calibrated back-up data loggers Vaccine Management Template complete and up-to-dateVFC Site Visit Overview IQIP is CDC's national, Vaccines for Children (VFC) provider-level immunization quality improvement (QI) program. IQIP promotes and supports implementation of provider-level strategies designed to help increase on-time vaccination of children and adolescents. Quality improvement (QI) programs, such as IQIP, analyze processes and use a systematic approach to improve performance. Like other QI programs, the IQIP program is based on these basic steps: State the problem and desired result Use data to understand the problem Identify strategies for improvement Implement strategies and refine as needed Evaluate outcomeIQIP Site Visit82 83 846/14/2023 29 Your clinic has an adult with Medicaid that is due for a Tdap.
