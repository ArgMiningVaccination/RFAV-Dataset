By over-vaccinating canines, we are introducing a potentially serious danger into society: brain damaged dogs. As Harris Coulter convincingly demonstrated in his book, \"Vaccination, Social Violence and Criminality\" the unwanted consequences of human vaccination include sudden unprovoked violence in children. No wonder the British government has seen the need to introduce the Dangerous Dogs Act. Amongst the vaccine-induced antibodies found in the Purdue study, autoantibodies to Cardiolipin were found. Elevated levels of anti-cardiolipin autoantibodies (ACA) have been reported to be significantly associated with neurological conditions. Encephalitis The Merck Manual describes encephalitis as \"an acute inflammatory disease of the brain due to direct viral invasion or to hypersensitivity initiated by a virus or other foreign protein ... Secondary encephalitis, usually a complication of viral infection, is considered to have an immunologic mechanism. Examples are the encephalitides following measles, chickenpox, rubella, smallpox vaccination, vaccinia, and many other less well defined viral infections.\" Encephalitis has been shown to appear in dogs after vaccination. (Grene, CE, ed, Appel MJ, Canine Distemper in Infectious Diseases of the Dog and Cat, 2nd edition, Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1998: 9-22). Writing in the Veterinary Record during 1992 (130, 27-30), AIP McCandlish et al state: \"Post-vaccinal encephalitis is a recognised complication of the administration of certain strains of live attenuated canine distemper vaccine (Hartley 1974, Bestetti and others 1978, Cornwell and others 1988)\". According to Braund's Clinical Neurology in Small Animals: Localization, Diagnosis and Treatment: Post vaccinal canine distemper encephalitis occurs in young animals, especially those less than six months of age. It has been recognised as a disease entity for a number of years, and is believed to be association with vaccination using live virus. The pathogenesis of this disease is unclear, but may result from insufficient attenuation of the vaccine virus which causes subsequent infections of the CNS; the triggering of a latent distemper infection by vaccination; other vaccine components; or an enhanced susceptibility of the animal (e.g., animals that are immunosuppressed). Merck states: \"Symptoms of encephalitis may be associated with cerebral dysfunction (alteration in consciousness, personality change, seizures, paresis) and cranial nerve abnormalities.\" It should be noted that encephalitis is a spectrum disease, ranging from mild and undetectable, through to severe manifestations, and even death. More Related Brain Injuries Paresis Another potential sequel to vaccine-induced encephalitis; Merck describes paresis as: \"Muscular weakness of neural origin. It is usually regarded as a state of partial or incomplete paralysis, resulting in a deficit of voluntary movement. Paresis may result from lesions at any level of the descending motor innervation pathway from the brain.\" In addition to my own four-year-old Golden Retriever, Oliver, presenting with paresis of both hind limbs before dying suddenly, I have been presented with many other anecdotal reports of dogs suffering paresis shortly after vaccination where the vets suspected no link to their vaccines, and no adverse event reports were filed. Epilepsy is also listed by Merck as a symptom of encephalitis, and we know that encephalitis can be vaccine-induced. Merck \"non-infectious causes of encephalitides include ... vaccine reactions: many\". Epilepsy It adds that epilepsy can be caused by \"CNS infections (meningitis, Aids, encephalitis) and also by a foreign serum or drug allergy, or by convulsive or toxic agents\". See also Ballerini, Rico B et al., Neurological Complications of Vaccination With Special Reference to Epileptic Syndrome Riview Neurol, Jul-Aug infectious hepatitis in the dog\" \"A 4-months-old, male, healthy dog developed CNS-symptoms 10 days after the second vaccination with live, attenuated distemper and canine hepatitis virus.\" G. Bestetti1, et al, Neuropathologica Volume 43, Numbers 1-2 / 69-75 \u2014 1/1/1978 According to the Society for Companion Animal Studies, \"epilepsy is the commonest neurological disorder seen in dogs and constitutes a major health problem. (Brewer, 199; Berendt 2002). \"It is probable that between 30,000 and 366,000 of the 6.1 million dogs in the UK suffer from epilepsy.\" Personality Changes Many dog owners have noted personality changes in their dogs shortly after vaccination, including nervous, worrying disposition; short attention span; and aggression. The Canine Health Concern survey found that high percentages of these conditions, where they existed in survey dogs, were reported to have started within three months of vaccination. The study is detailed in What Vets Don't Tell You About Vaccines, Catherine O'Driscoll. Among the various reasons for (dog) euthanasia, behavioral problems account for 50% to 70% ... Vaccine Induced Autism Scientists other than Dr Andrew Wakefield have discovered a vaccine-autism (neurological) link. For example, the Department of Pediatrics, Tokyo Medical University, Japan, found the measles virus in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and autism. (Dig Dis Sci, 2000, Apri; 45(4) 723-9) . The sequences obtained from the patients with ulcerative colitis and children with autism were consistent with vaccine strains. It should be remembered that the measles virus and canine distemper are very closely related. In Toxicol Environ Chem 2008 90(5):997-1008, researchers also found a correlation between the Hepatitis B triple series vaccine and developmental disability in US children aged 1-9 years. (29) RELATED: [Can dogs have autism?](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/can-dogs-have-autism/) Myelin Sheath Damage The myelin sheath may also be pertinent in relation to vaccine damage. Merck states: \"The myelin sheaths of many nerve fibers promote transmission of the neural impulse along the axon. Many congenital metabolic disorders affect the developing myelin sheath. Unless the innate biochemical defect can be corrected or compensated for, permanent, often widespread, neurological deficits results.\" But vaccines can also play their part. Merck adds: \"In acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (post infectious encephalitis), demyelination can occur spontaneously, but usually follows a viral infection or inoculation (or very rarely a bacterial vaccine), suggesting an immunologic cause.\" Album Deficiency Vaccines have been shown to cause dogs to develop autoantibodies to their own albumin (Purdue study). Albumin is manufactured by the liver, enabling fluid to remain in the bloodstream rather than leak into tissues. If albumin gets low, fluid builds up and inflammation can occur in the body. Fatty acids are carried with the aid of albumin to cells in the body. They are the building blocks for lipids, which form all of the membranes around and inside cells. Fatty acids are essential for life, and albumin is essential for their distribution. If vaccinated dogs are attacking their own albumin, then neurological function could be impaired. This, in turn, has a bearing on the UK's Dangerous Dogs Act, the danger posed by vaccinated dogs to humans, and the perceived need for such an Act. From Purdue University: \"Each year, millions of dogs are abandoned and euthanized. Among the various reasons for euthanasia, behavioral problems account for 50% to 70% of all terminations. Aside from uncontrollable factors that contribute to this problem such as genetics, disease, and aging, nutritional imbalance can also be a factor. However, since nutrition is a controllable factor, it is among the easiest to correct. Behavior is regulated in the central nervous system through the actions of neurotransmitters and hormones. Dietary factors may directly contribute to the availability of these factors, or indirectly influence the environment where the actions of these factors take place. \"It is well known that polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially omega-3 and omega-6, play important roles as structural constituents in the brain. Recent studies also established that omega-3 fatty acids are necessary for proper brain and eye development. There is evidence that a dietary supply of omega-3 and omega-6 could modify aspects of dopamine and serotonin in the body, and subsequently affect cognitive performance and behavior. \"It is also shown in humans, as well as in rats, that alterations in omega-3 fatty acids and an elevated ratio of omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids are linked to behavioral alterations, including aggression. \"Reports also showed that, relative to normal dogs, aggressive dogs showed lower circulating DHA (an omega 3 fatty acid) concentrations and a higher ratio of omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids in the measurement of baseline fasting plasma essential fatty acid composition. \"Considering the fact that the most abundant fatty acid in the brain is DHA, it is apparent that deficiency in this essential nutrient could have a profound effect on the behavior of the dog. \"In conclusion, dietary DHA, as well as its precursor omega-3 fatty acids, could be a potential resource in fending off canine behavioral problems. These are found in fish oils.\" If dogs develop autoantibodies to albumin as a direct result of routine vaccination, their neurological function is but one likely casualty. "}
