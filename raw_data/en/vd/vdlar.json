COVID-19 most often causes respiratory symptoms that can feel much like a cold, a flu, or pneumonia. COVID-19 may attack more than your lungs and respiratory system. Other parts of your body may also be affected by the disease. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people become severely ill. Some people including those with minor or no symptoms may suffer from post-COVID conditions \u2014 or \"long COVID\". Older adults and people who have certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Hundreds of thousands of people have died from COVID-19 in the United States. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective. Vaccines teach our immune system to fight the virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth. In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch. People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected. COVID-19 is spread in three main ways: Breathing in air when close to an infected person who is exhaling small droplets and particles that contain the virus. Having these small droplets and particles that contain virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth, especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze. Touching eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the virus on them.* Ensuring the safety of the Sangha In order to ensure the safety of our community, the Abbot and Temple Advisory Committee (TAC), in close consultation with the MRO Board and epidemiological advisors, are carefully monitoring conditions and governmental guidelines. The following guidelines are current as of April 2023 and will be updated as appropriate. 2 Contact Us If you have any questions or concerns about these guidelines, please contact our office at zcnyc@dharma.net or call (718) 875-8229.

Both the teacher and the student should remain masked when in the daisan room. Robes Formal MRO students are expected to wear robes and may store them at the temple.

Hand hygiene We encourage everyone wash their hands or to use hand sanitizer upon arrival at the Temple and prior to entering the sitting area.

The following spaces will be accessed and used only by residents: West door (the rightmost door when viewing the Temple from the front sidewalk) West stairway 3rd Floor 4th Floor The following spaces will be accessible to pre-registered Sangha members joining for zazen, subject to the health protocols noted above: East Door (the leftmost door when viewing the Temple from the front sidewalk) East Stairway Main Zendo Buddha Hall 2nd floor coat room 2nd floor Bathroom near coat room Ventilation With the sangha's health in mind, Fire Lotus Temple recently installed a new HVAC system with MERV 13 filters as well an ultraviolet light disinfection system. This system provides near-hospital-grade air filtration. In addition, we will have HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) air purifiers, which are recommended by the CDC to reduce the risk of COVID transmission, running at all times during zazen and other onsite programs.
