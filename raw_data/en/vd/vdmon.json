The yoga retreat is held in the peaceful setting at Wild Oasis Algarve, in the hills of Monchique, Algarve, Portugal. Here we will immerse ourselves in the stunning natural surroundings of the area. We will guide you on a beautiful journey of self therapy through different yoga practices, ceremonies and techniques to help you cleanse, breathe and heal. During this yoga retreat we will help you embrace your true nature through harmonic movement and connection to your mind, body and breath. The Algarve is the perfect setting for your journey. Emerge and rise! Recharge yourself during this empowering journey with us. We want you to leave this week feeling at home and at peace in your body and mind. Learning how to surrender into the moment and let go whatever does not serve you. Our yoga retreat is for all levels whether you are new to yoga or an advanced yoga practitioner. We will practice asanas, meditation and pranayama daily with the inclusion of special additional evening ceremonies. All meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) will be provided by our private, hand-picked chef and will of course be veggie/vegan. Snacks, teas and water will be available throughout the day. Each morning before the yoga class we practice a silent start to the day, to be calm and with our own thoughts, and because we understand yoga happens off the mat too. Morning yoga classes will be energising vinyasa classes, to wake up our bodies and raise your natural energy. A healthy breakfast follows the morning yoga class to prepare you for the day. Then it is free time to read, go in the swimming pool and sauna, enjoy the beautiful surroundings of the Algarve, go for a hike in nature or one of the many other activities in the area, such as horse riding or cycling. You'll be provided with Snacks to take with. Afternoon yoga will be a relaxing Yin and Pranayama session to unwind from the day, slow down, observe and contemplate. Dinner is followed by an evening ritual, with occasional guest teachers who will perform special ceremonies such as sound bath meditation and cacao ceremony. We encourage all guests to digital detox as much as possible, especially at night time before sleeping and in the morning upon waking.
