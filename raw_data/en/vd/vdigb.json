Delays in diagnosis and care result in: Needless suffering Increases in community spread Perpetuation of stigma and inequities Be prepared to evaluate patients with monkeypox symptoms while providing a welcoming and affirming care environment. Some examples of affirming care: Ask patients for their gender pronouns: \"What name and pronouns would you like us to use?\" or \"I would like to be respectful \u2014how would you like to be addressed?\" Additionally, ask what terms they use for their bodies or specific body parts When taking a sexual history, consider saying: \"It's important for me to understand your medical history in detail to provide you the best health care possible.\" Avoid assumptions about patients' sexual orientation or the gender or gender identity of their partners. Avoid assumptions regarding the types of sexual activity (e.g., oral, anal, vaginal, or no sexual activity at all) that people engage in. Elicit this information with open -ended questions. DoNOT assume that a patient is at high risk on the basis of gender identity; rather, risk assessment should be based oneach individual's sexual history. https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/clinicians/transforming- health/health -care -providers/sexual -history.htmlIfyou -specimens.html Note:testing inpopulation with lowprevalence more likely tohave falsely positive results Notify health department and your facility's infection control team Can behelpful with contact tracing and identifying person eligible forpost -exposure prophylaxis Consider labs (10,000 tests/week) LRN labs (located within thestate public FDA cleared Commercial laboratory testing isnow available (70,000 additional tests/week) 40,000 testing capacity perweek using CDC NVO test 30,000 tests ofcommercial MPOX -specific laboratory test Current testing capacity isatleast 80,000 tests perweekTesting forSuspect MPX Cases Specimen type types through aresearch protocol Specifics ontheacceptable lesion specimen type accepted within theLRN and commercial laboratories (e.g., dryswab orswab inVTM orUTM) This isbased testing foranysuspect monkeypox patient Based onclinical presentation and/or thepositive predictive oftest results Other differentials should also be ifthere are noknown monkeypox epilinks or CPT formonkeypox testing isavailable atcommercial labs yet Each commercial labperforming testing may have their own CPT billing codes formonkeypox that canbeaccessed ontheir website byclinicians The company performing thetesting willbillprivate insurance, Medicaid, or Medicare Orthopoxvirus Results Interpretation There arenoother circulating orthopoxviruses within theUnited States that cause systemic disease Clinical care such asisolation recommendations should begin based onthe orthopoxvirus test result and should notwait onanyadditional viral characterization 24 hours: Positive or negative monkeypox or non-variola orthopoxvirus test resultsHealthcare IPC 101 - Monkeypox Have processes in place to rapidly identify transmissible infectious organisms at patient/resident presentation. Examples: screening algorithms or questions. Standard Precautions AND Personal Protective Equipment: Gowns, Gloves, eye protection, and N95 or higher -level respirator Place in single -person room with door closed (if safe to do so) ; dedicated bathroom Patient should wear a well -fitting mask as source control and have any exposed skin lesions covered when transported outside of the room. Aerosol generating procedures should be performed in an airborne infection isolation room ( AIIR), (negative pressure room) See next slide for additional IPC guidance. Notify Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Department or Designee To ensure appropriate IPC prevention measures are instituted and to monitor potential healthcare worker or patient/resident exposures. Notify Maine CDC at 1 -800- 821- 5821 Any confirmed case of monkeypox is immediately reportable to Maine CDC within 24 hours; and All monkeypox or non-variola orthopoxvirus test results (positive or negative) are reportable to Maine CDC within 24 hoursIdentify Isolate Inform U.S. CDC IPC guidance :https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/infection- control -healthcare.html Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Questions, contact MECDC.HAI@maine.govHealthcare IPC 101 - Monkeypox Environmental Considerations Cleaning/Disinfection : Standard cleaning & disinfection procedures using an EPA -registered hospital-grade disinfectant with an -viral- pathogens -evps -list-q Use wet cleaning methods if possible. Avoid activities that could resuspend dried material from lesions, e.g., use of portable fans, dry dusting, sweeping, vacuuming. Soiled Laundry (e.g., bedding, towels, personal clothing): Handle in accordance with recommended standard practices, avoiding contact with lesion material that may be present on the laund ry. Should be gently and promptly contained in an appropriate laundry bag and should never be shaken or handled in manner that ma y disperse infectious material. Waste management : West African Clade currently circulating based on testing. In general, manage waste as Regulated Medical Waste (RMW), Category B . If you have determined that patient has known epidemiological risk for the Congo Basin clade ( e.g., history of travel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, Cameroon, or Gabon in the prior 21 days) , manage waste as Category A infectious substance pending clade confirmation. Duration of Precautions Minimally Isolation Precautions should be maintained until all lesions have crusted, those crusts have separated, and a fresh layer of healthy skin has formed underneath. For questions/consultations please feel free to reach out to Maine CDC. Exposure Management Utilizes a degree of exposure risk assessment, see: https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/monitoring.html U.S. CDC IPC guidance :https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/infection- control -healthcare.html Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Questions, contact MECDC.HAI@maine.govMedical Countermeasures Currently Stockpiled forOrthopoxviruses Vaccines Replaced Dryvax -license bymanufacturer and remaining vaccine destroyed Indication ACAM2000 isindicated foractive immunization against smallpox disease for persons determined tobeathigh riskforsmallpox infection CDC-held Expanded Access Investigational New Drug Protocol Infection (e.g., Ankara after vaccination Inadvertent inoculation and autoinoculationRisk exists Norisk Serious adverse event Risk exists Fewer expected Cardiac adverse events Myopericarditis in5.7per1,000 primary vaccineesRisk believed tobelower than that forACAM2000 response \"take\" rates toDryvax*FDA assessed bycomparing to ACAM2000 & animal studies Percutaneously technique vaccine vaccination forselect persons atriskforoccupational exposure toorthopoxviruses Policy note published June 3,2022 Use ofJYNNEOS and Monkeypox Vaccine, Live, Nonreplicating) ofPersons for Practices \u2014United Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis People who should getPrEP include: Clinical laboratory personnel who perform testing todiagnose orthopoxviruses, those who usepolymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays fordiagnosis oforthopoxviruses, including Monkeypox virus Research laboratory workers who directly handle cultures oranimals contaminated orinfected with orthopoxviruses that infect humans, including Monkeypox virus, replication -competent Vaccinia virus, or recombinant Vaccinia viruses derived from replication -competent Vaccinia virus strains Certain healthcare and public health response team members designated bypublic health authorities tobevaccinated forpreparedness purposes laboratory officers and supervisors toidentify risks and precautions, depending onthetype of work they aredoing Clinicians and laboratorians should X X X Other active exfoliative skin conditions X X X Conditions associated with immunosuppression X X X Pregnancy X X X Aged <1year X X X Breastfeeding X X Serious vaccine component allergy X X X Known underlying heart disease (e.g., coronary artery disease orcardiomyopathy)X X Three ormore known major cardiac risk factors forPrEP forPersons at Risk Strategy Considerations Jurisdictions with larger numbers ofcases arereporting that high percentages ofcontacts cannot beidentified Desire toplan and implement expanded vaccination programs Electing similar approaches tostrategies being used inMontreal and theU.K. Monkeypox (PEP)++ Vaccination ofpeople with certain riskfactors that might make them more likely to have been recently exposed tomonkeypox Aims toreach these individuals forpost -exposure prophylaxis vaccination even ifthey have nothad confirmed exposure tomonkeypoxVaccine Strategy Considerations Currently limited supply ofJYNNEOS although more expected inJuly and later thisyear Goal -focus allocation ofcurrently available ofhighest transmission based and projected population- cases Weighted bypopulation ofMSM with HIVoreligible forHIVPrEPVaccination Jynneos is an FDA -approved vaccine used to prevent monkeypox infection among at -riskindividuals 18 years and older. Made from a non- replicating virus, so Jynneos can be given to people with weakened immune systems, and those who are pregnant or who have other health conditions. Subcutaneous vaccine series with two -doses at 0 and 28 days (+/ -7 days). CDC recommends that the vaccine be given within 4 days from the date ofexposure in order to prevent onset of the disease. If given between 4-14 days after the date of exposure, vaccination may reduce the symptoms of disease, but may not prevent the disease. People who receive Jynneos are not considered vaccinated until 2 weeks after they receive the second dose of the vaccine.JYNNEOS Replication -deficient Vaccinia virus Licensed aspre- exposure prophylaxis forlaboratory and other personnel with occupational exposure toorthopoxviruses Booster doses recommended every 2years forthose with exposure tomonkeypox The only contraindication issevere allergy toavaccine component. Side effects include injection sitereactions; serious side effects arerare. The other vaccines oJYNNEOS typically may be administered without regard to timing of other vaccines. This includes simultaneous administration of JYNNEOS and other vaccines on the same day, but at different anatomic sites if possible. See ACIP's general best practices andEpidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (Pink Book) for further information.(See Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID -19 Vaccines | CDC ) Given potential common risk factors for acquiring hepatitis A and monkeypox, those seeking Jynneos vaccine due to elevated risk factors should also be protected against hep A through co- administration with the hepatitis A vaccine.Current National Vaccine Strategy Monkeypox Vaccine prevent illness from monkeypox virus High degree ofexposure: PEP recommended Intermediate degree ofexposure: Informed clinical decision making recommended onan individual basis todetermine whether benefits ofPEP outweigh risks Brief interactions and those conducted using appropriate PPE inaccordance with Standard Precautions thedisease However, when coupled with self-isolation and other prevention measures when symptoms first occur, PEP isimportant forcontrolling outbreaks and preventing further transmission with certain riskfactors aremore likely recently exposed to people steps toprotect themselves* from infection byavoiding close, skin-to-skin contact, including intimate contact, with someone who hasmonkeypox Tobetter understand risks and benefits ofthese vaccines inthecurrent outbreak, CDC isworking with partners tocollect doses tobemade available anticipates making ~1.9 million doses available in2022, with anadditional 2.2 million doses available during thefirstdose JYNNEOS hasbeen evaluated andshown tobesafe andeffective ineliciting JYNNEOS areconsidered toreach maximal immunity 14days after their second ifJYNNEOS willfully protect against monkeypox virus infection inthisoutbreak Individuals should take additional preventive measures andself-isolate assoon asthey develop monkeypox symptoms, such of Monkeypox Vaccine U.S. CDC has allocated 440 doses of Jynneos to Maine. Maine may receive an additional 660 doses over the next two months. We must balance the use of vaccination for close contacts and those at risk of exposure. This supply includes 1 stand 2nddoses. 48Vaccine Allocations Total Available Doses: Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) Expanded Post Exposure Prophylaxis (Expanded PEP) Close contacts of confirmed cases of monkeypox infection Close contacts of unconfirmed cases of monkeypox infectionFor people who are possible close contacts not identified through public health investigations, and otherwise meet eligibility criteria **This planned vaccine allocation could change if Maine identifies confirmed cases in coming weeks, as priority will be given to close contacts of confirmed cases (i.e., PEP). If high cases are recorded, PEP++ may be paused, based on vaccine supply. Expanding Vaccine Eligibility and Access Current Jynneos eligibility is for: High -risk close contacts of someone with monkeypox, OR Gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men, and/or transgender, gender non-conforming, or gender non -binary who have had multiple sexual partners Maine is also expanding the number of clinics that will offer the vaccine.Expanded PEP Vaccination Locations Location Clinic Name Augusta Maine Family Planning MaineGeneral -Horizon Clinic Bangor Maine Family Planning Ogunquit/Kennebunk Local Roots Health Care Lewiston Maine Family Planning Portland City of Portland MMP Gilman St. Clinic South Portland Greater vaccination and adverse reactions, guidance forclinicians: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htmTreatment Who to treat for monkeypox How to prescribe TPOXX Where to access treatmentTreatment Considerations forMonkeypox Many individuals infected with monkeypox virus have amild, self-limiting disease course intheabsence ofspecific therapy The prognosis formonkeypox depends onmultiple factors such as previous vaccination status, initial health status, and concurrent illnesses or comorbiditiesTreatment Considerations for Monkeypox Patients who should be considered for treatment following consultation with CDC might include: People with severe disease (e.g., hemorrhagic disease, confluent lesions, sepsis, encephalitis, or other conditions requiring hospitalization) People who may be at high risk of severe disease: People with immunocompromise (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection, leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, solid organ transplantation, therapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radiation, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, high -dose corticosteroids, being a recipient with hematopoietic stem cell transplant <24 months post -transplant or 24 months but with graft- versus -host disease or disease relapse, or having autoimmune disease with immunodeficiency as a clinical component)1 Pediatric populations, particularly patients younger than 8 years of age2 People with a history or presence of atopic dermatitis, persons with other active exfoliative skin conditions burns, impetigo, varicella zoster virus infection, herpes simplex virus infection, severe acne, severe diaper dermatitis with extensive areas of denuded skin, psoriasis, or Darier disease [keratosis follicularis]) Pregnant or breastfeeding women3 People with one or more complications (e.g., secondary bacterial skin infection;
