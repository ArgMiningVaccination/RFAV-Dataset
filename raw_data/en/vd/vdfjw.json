With an estimated [risk]of 33% [mortality]from [population], critical. Initial extension to [vaccination]intervals in the [United Kingdom]to 12 weeks in December 2020 led to concerns that PCD [patients]would be left vulnerable for an extended period. [Methods]A [clinical audit]was performed on measured serological responses in PCD and second doses of the [BNT162b2]and ChAdOx-1 Antibody levels were for Positive cut-off of 0.80 U/mL defined serological response. Testing was performed at (or closest to) 4 and 8-weeks post- [dose]. Baseline [nucleocapsid]Ab results were available from previous a subset of [patients]. All [patients]on CIT underwent 4-weekly swabs. Clinical information was from records]. PCD median age 64 (range 32-84), had serological assessment after both [vaccine]doses. Fourteen with previous COVID-19 [infection]were excluded. Of 174 [patients], 112 were tested after first [dose]. 88% (153) were first [dose]was 63% available negative baseline seroconverted. After second [dose], 89% seroconverted. Expectedly, paired median titres after 25 (61%) seroconverted after second, though with lower titres than those only requiring one [dose](Figure 1B). Active CIT, [disease], [male] [gender]and not responding to first [dose]were significant factors for not responding to two [vaccine]doses. We explored <400 U/mL as sub-optimal response (in keeping with upcoming booster study eligibility, OCTAVE-DUO(1), also encompassing the lower quartile of reported healthy controls(2)), which included 43% (75/174) independent predictors of less-than-optimal response (anti-CD38 CIT of borderline significance). Importantly, [vaccine]dosing intervals classified as =<42 vs >42 days (Figure 1C) or 28 +/- 14 days vs 84 +/- 14 days (excluding n=66 in neither) (Figure 1D) did not show difference in both definitions of response, neither did [vaccine]type. Fourteen with previous COVID-19 [infection]responded titres 2500-2500) after second [dose](Figure 1E), significantly higher than without previous [infection]. Conclusion Serological response to [COVID-19 vaccine]is lower in PCD [patients]than reported healthy controls at 63% after first [dose], rising to 89% after second [dose], despite extended dosing intervals. PCD [patients]should be prioritised for shorter intervals, as we show that [patients]seronegative after first [dose], respond after second [dose]. Further [work]in PCD is needed to understand how Ab levels correlate to neutralisation capability, cellular responses, [protection]from [infection]and how long [seroconversion]lasts to better define correlates of [protection]. A booster [vaccination]or prophylactic passive antibody strategy may be required for those identified at [risk], shown not to have responded to two [vaccine]doses or to have less-than-optimal response. Results from these trials [will]be eagerly awaited. (Figure Presented). Texto completo: Dispon\u00edvel "}
