There are several different [drugs](https://www.orlandorecovery.com/treatment-programs/medications-used/) used [during detox](/detox-timelines/) to help with pain and withdrawal symptoms, but what many people don't realize is that vitamins and minerals are also beneficial. Vitamins help your body remove toxins and rebuild the immune system. Additionally, they may help reduce the anxiety and restlessness caused by withdrawal. Vitamins also help replace deficiencies that have been caused by frequent and/or abusive drug use. Here are six vitamins and minerals that help remove toxins and are often beneficial during drug or [alcohol detox](/treatment-programs/medical-detox/): 1. Multivitamins Drugs and alcohol deplete all soluble vitamins in the body, especially during the early stages of withdrawal. A round of multivitamins helps restore low levels of vitamins that your body badly needs. Additionally, vitamin deficiencies are partially responsible for much of the lethargy, skin irritation, memory loss and depression people experience in the early stages of detox and recovery. A good multivitamin should help optimize your body's functions and help you feel a little more \"normal.\" 2. Vitamin C Abusing drugs and alcohol often deplete the body of vitamin C. Taking extra vitamin C may be beneficial in supporting the immune system. It can also help to reduce the stress that your body creates as it returns to normal after withdrawal. You can get vitamin C from a number of different sources such as citrus fruits and juices along with green vegetables such as peppers. 3. B Vitamins After years of [heavy drinking](/drug-addiction-resources/alcohol/binge-drinking-everything-you-need-to-know/) or drug use, B vitamins are often severely depleted. B1 (thiamine), B3 (niacin) and B5 (pantothenic acid) play a role in turning sugar from your body into energy. Additionally, B6 and B12 play an important role in producing blood cells and keeping the nervous system healthy. B8 (inositol) and B9 (folic acid) are helpful in treating deficits that relate to dietary habits and substance-related changes in the digestive track. B vitamins - especially niacin supplements - have cleansing properties that help to quickly remove toxins introduced during drug use. Taking any (or all) of these vitamins helps bring your body to a normal, more regular state. 4. Vitamin E Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant in the body to help reduce damage from chemicals and oxidative stress. It works to restore proper functioning of blood cells and may help repair skin damage that occurred due to excessive skin picking or abscesses that formed due to drug injection. 5. Calcium And Magnesium A major withdrawal [symptom from drugs and alcohol is anxiety](/drug-addiction-resources/alcohol/how-to-taper-off-alcohol/), which can be severe. Calcium and magnesium help calm the central nervous system and relieve anxiety. They may also help relieve muscle tension, twitches and cramps that frequently occur during detox. Foods that are rich in calcium and magnesium include dairy products, green leafy vegetables and grains. 6. Garlic Garlic helps your body detox from and eliminate THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. Instead of eating garlic, try taking garlic pills every day. Or you can take a daily vitamin supplement that includes garlic as one of its main ingredients. Often, [active addiction](https://www.orlandorecovery.com/treatment-programs/addiction-treatment-during-covid/) involves reaching for your drug of choice rather than a healthy meal or exercising. Withdrawal places a lot of stress on your body's metabolic system and organs. Additionally, withdrawal symptoms such as vomiting, diarhhea and nausea often cause poor nutrient absorption and mineral deficiencies. That's why it's so important to supplement detox with vitamins and minerals. Not only do they help bring your body back to a normal state, they also aid in removing toxins from your body and give you the nutrients you need for a healthy (and successful) recovery. "}
