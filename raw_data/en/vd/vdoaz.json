We are used to a very fast lifestyle and to living many moments with our automatic pilot running. At [ARTIEM](https://www.artiemhotels.com/en/) we are aware of the importance of a correct balance between mind and body. This is the basis of good physical, mental and emotional health. And, because we care about your health, we aim to promote good practices for a balanced and happy life, such as meditation. There are different types of meditation that allow you to find yourself, increase your mindfulness and help you find calm by devoting just a few minutes daily to them. In case you are not familiar with it, meditation is an ancestral practice that aims to train the mind and conscience to focus on the present, eliminate our thoughts, bring us closer to self-awareness and [reduce stress](https://www.artiemhotels.com/en/blog/reduce-stress-and-anxiety). It is rooted in different Asiatic religions and spiritual traditions, but today, it is practised across the world because of its many benefits, which include: - Reducing the effects of stress. - Increasing self-awareness. - Improving the capacity to focus and concentrate. - Improving memory and cognitive functions. - Helping to improve the mindset. Types of meditation If you have never meditated before, you may find it difficult at first, which is quite normal. Acquiring the habit of meditating requires a little practice, dedication and perseverance, but it is worthwhile making an effort to achieve all the benefits it offers. Start by spending 10 minutes every day and gradually increase the time as you progress. In addition, use guided meditation apps, for example. Apart from the above, it is worthwhile trying [different types of meditation](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/types-of-meditation), to find the one that is best suited to you. These are some of the most popular: 1. Vipassana meditation In [mindfulness techniques](https://www.artiemhotels.com/en/blog/your-best-self-with-these-mindfulness-techniques) this type of breathing meditation is used, raising awareness about it and inhaling and exhaling through the nose. Every time a thought or an emotion enters your mind, identify it and let it go without judging. This concentration and mediation technique is based on introspection. You must be aware of all that goes on inside you in order to be able to control it. 2. Kundalini meditation Kundalini energy is located at the base of the spine (the root chakra) and this meditation serves to awaken that energy, move it through the body and release it. Its purpose is to create a communication system between body and mind, to ease mental, physical and spiritual problems by acquiring greater mindfulness and intention in daily life. It includes breathing techniques, mantras, mudras and chants. A lot of practice is required in order to master the technique but it is certainly very rewarding. 3. Chakra meditation If you've practised yoga, you'll know that chakras are the energy points of the body. There are seven of them, located in different regions. Chakra Meditation is a type of meditation that helps to connect the physical and emotional states of being. For this reason, the sound is used. The hands are placed on specific parts of the body and viewing techniques are used to connect with the chakras that are blocked or misaligned. The activated chakras help us feel an emotional balance, experience our thoughts and feelings with greater security and feel good in physical terms. 4. Zazen meditation Zazen or Zen [meditation](https://www.artiemhotels.com/en/blog/relaxation-methods-apps) is closely linked to Buddhism and seeks to experience a void. To put it into practice you must count each inhalation and exhalation. If you lose track, you must start again from zero and reach 10. This type of meditation, which calms the mind and connects with your interior, is rather difficult for beginners as it requires you to keep your body in a stiff position with your back straight, your chin facing down, your hands on your stomach and your eyes open and looking down. 5. Mantra meditation This type of meditation is focused on a series of sacred chants that lead us to medicate and manage to deepen our awareness. The vibration that provokes the sounds in your mind and body is very powerful and exerts effects on the body. Mantras may be recited aloud, listened to or recited internally. It is best to recite them to generate that vibration in our body and attract the energy with our voice. The most important mantra is Om, which is considered to be the sound of the universe and contains all the other sounds. 6. Tonglen meditation Tonglen, which means \"giving and taking\", is very popular in Tibetan Buddhism. This practice is used to directly face one's own suffering and that of others, and to awaken compassion. Through the inhalations and exhalations that connect us with shared problems, Tonglen invites us to inhale pain and exhale calm. It is the perfect meditation for helping to overcome obstacles, creating an attitude that is positive and beneficial for those who practise it. 7. Transcendental Meditation This practice is based on repeating the same mantra twice a day for 20 minutes. Sitting in a comfortable position, inhale slowly and deeply through your nose, hold the air in your lungs for a few seconds and exhale calmly through your nose or mouth. Transcendental Meditation brings calm, positive energy and relaxation. However, to reach this point, practice is important, as remaining still for 20 minutes is quite difficult. The different types of meditation and their benefits will allow us to choose the one that best suits our tastes and needs. As in any other practice, meditation requires us to feel comfortable and sufficiently motivated to practise it every day. Over time, you will create a habit and the results will start to be seen. If you want to start medicating, there are different ways to do it. You can find a centre that gives classes, usually a yoga studio, for an instructor to guide you in the practise, or you can do it alone using [mobile apps to relax](https://www.artiemhotels.com/en/blog/relaxation-methods-apps) or practise guided meditation sessions that are available on the Internet. If you are a beginner, it is always best to have someone to advise you and resolve your doubts, but today there are free resources for you to try and gradually progress in practising your meditation.
