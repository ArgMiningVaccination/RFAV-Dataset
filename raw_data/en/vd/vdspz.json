For me, it is anticipating past experiences and feeling tension into the future that has not yet arrived. I think of blankets of snow or no snow. Fast or floating snowflakes of all sizes falling with or without wind. Then shoveling, shoveling, and more shoveling. Cold brisk air and smoke like breaths and catching snowflakes on the tongue. The snow glistening like little diamonds under a clear blue sky in the moonlight. And the bright sun warming a bundled-up body often puts a smile on my face. The silence of empty streets, walks on crunchy ice, minding each step so as not to slip. Darkness ascending and then descending from the beginning, middle, and end of this season. All seasons invite us to \" come to our senses \" but nothing like Winter. For me winter is a season to deepen my mindfulness practice in everyday life. It's like the urge to hunker inside in the winter becomes an invitation to slow down . Avoiding trying to get somewhere else other than here. This season calls us to be intentional about movement, beckoning us to slow down, feel the air, move into stillness and the quieting of activity. To abide in more reflection, on perhaps what really has heart and meaning which vacillates between staying put inside or going outdoors. Either way, in winter we can experience more of the stillness of the season . With mindfulness, each season awakens various aspects of the senses: sights, smells, touch, tastes, and sounds - including the sounds of silence. Everything around us in the Winter models our slowing down. So here are a few books to curl up with this season when you choose to be available staying put. Joseph Bailey's Slowing Down to the Speed of Love could be a metaphor for really stepping out of the fast lane and moving into the slow lane, as cultural anthropologist Angeles Arrien says, \"life happens in the slow to medium lanes\". Winter is a time to be gentle with yourself and with others, to step into difficult times as Katherine May describes in Wintering: The Power of Rest and Retreat in Difficult Times . I am looking forward to this wisdom from the winters we encounter in our lives. Mindfulness meditation practice is a way to \"Pause, Rest and Be\" as in Octavia Fr. Raheem's book Pause, Rest, and Be: Stillness Practices for Courage in Times of Change. Finally, several of us in the Integrative Health division are embarking on iRest Yoga Nidra, Integrative Restoration training. So, I am happy to share this new book by Tracee Stanley called: A time of Radiant Rest: Yoga Nidra for Deep Relaxation and Awakened Clarity. So by the time Spring arrives, may YOU feel more relaxed, rested, renewed, and re-awakened to life from that place of seeing, hearing, feeling, knowing, and being what you love.

Charlotte Alvar az, LAc and Danielle Berres, DPT What brings you comfort in winter time? I enjoy the rejuvenation that winter brings -- the natural slowing down, the stillness, the invitation for restoration, the darker days and longer nights. A cold, snowy Minnesota winter encourages rest and nourishment. It's an ideal time to spend more time cultivating important relationships, including the one with oneself. What is a healthy pleasure of yours? My morning ritual. I wake before the sun, brew a hot cup of ceremonial grade cacao, gaze at candlelight, listen to beautiful music, breathe intentionally, read a spiritual passage and quietly reflect. WINTER OFFERINGS practices, and spiritual health. It gives me a more well- rounded picture of the person I am working with and to meet them where they are on their journey. What brings you comfort in winter time? If I don't have to drive in it, I really do love the snow! I love playing in it with my family and am looking forward to teaching my 3-year-old to ski. I also love cooking hearty meals, creating elaborate menus for holiday dinners and spending days planning, shopping, and cooking with family. What is a healthy pleasure of yours? Wandering around art galleries. I get the physical benefits of slow, mindful walking, along with the mental benefits of looking at beautiful creations. I also love spontaneous dance parties with my two toddlers - we love changing lyrics to something silly and dancing until we fall on the couch! I am a strong believer in the concept of play, not only for children, but adults, too - I encourage my patients to play when they practice their PT exercises so that they can find joy and decrease pain. Charlotte Alvaraz, LAc What is your specialty? Acupuncture What do you love most about your job? My favorite part of being an acupuncturist is collaborating as a partner with my patients, acting as a guide and support in the quest for optimum health. The relationship and rapport between provider and patient is of utmost importance to me. Danielle Berres, DPT What is your specialty? Integrative Physical Therapy What do you love most about your job? I love discussing all the components of health with my patients - not just physical health but sleep, emotional health, mind-body of the moon's gaze in a valley of snow. Tonight as it gets cold tell yourself what you know which is nothing but the tune your bones play as you keep going. And you will be able for once to lie down under the small fire of winter stars. And if it happens that you cannot go on or turn back and you find yourself where you will be at the end,tell yourself in that final flowing of cold through your limbs that you love what you are. "}
