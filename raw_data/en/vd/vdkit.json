The macula is part of the back of the eye that detects light. When the macula breaks down, central vision becomes blurry. This affects the ability to see fine details. Early signs and symptoms of AMD: Increased blurriness of smaller print Fuzzy appearance of straight lines Increased difficulty adapting to dim light Difficulty recognizing faces AMD can be prevented and/or treated. To help lower your risk of AMD, keep the following in mind: Wear sunglasses to prevent UV damage. Choose lutein-rich foods. Lutein maintains eye health. The body does not make lutein, so it needs to come from the diet. Lutein-rich foods include egg yolks, dark green leafy vegetables, orange and yellow vegetables, and fruits such as kiwi and grapes. Check out your local farmers market , go.iastate.edu/E16ZAI, for lutein-rich produce. Don't smoke. Smoking can advance AMD damage. If you are ready to quit, call the tobacco hotline at 1-800-784- 8669. The hotline is open 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. Monday through Friday. Get regular eye exams. Early treatment is critical to prevent common eye diseases from causing permanent damage. EyeCare America , go.iastate.edu/HBIWUX, provides free eye exams for adults ages 65 years and older.

Pack only what you need. This will lessen food waste since foods kept out for more than 2 hours (1 hour if 90\u00b0+F) should be tossed. Follow these tips to keep food safe: Wash your hands and surfaces before, during, and after handling raw food items. Use paper towels to clean up spills. Avoid cross-contamination by keeping raw foods separated from cooked foods. Use separate cutting boards for meats and produce. Check temperatures. Use a food thermometer to check the food's temperature before serving. Watch the food thermometer video , go.iastate.edu/2VJCT3. Keep cold foods cold. Keep cold foods chilled at 40\u00b0F or lower. Keep coolers filled with ice. Frozen bottles of water can serve as ice packs. Replace ice frequently if melted. Keep hot foods hot. Keep hot foods hot at 140\u00b0F or higher. Wrap and cover foods and place in an insulated warming container until needed.

Research suggests that adaptogens, a group of plant-based herbs, may help our immune system by calming our central nervous system, decreasing anxiety, and boosting overall health. Five common adaptogens are: Astragalus Root. Increases the production of immune cells and boosts heart health. Ginseng. May reduce inflammation, enhance strength and stamina, and improve blood sugar. Holy Basil. Antioxidant that treats bacterial, inflammatory infections. Licorice Root. Soothes the stomach, reduces stress, and cleanses the respiratory system. Raw Cacao. Helps improve digestion, enhances learning, and balances mood swings. Schisandra. Boosts the immune system by managing stress, protects against liver disease, and treats menopause symptoms. Before adding any adaptogen, other herbal remedies, or supplements, consult with your health care provider to ensure they are safe for you.
